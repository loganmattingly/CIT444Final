21,1724,Sep 28 2009 	Very nice hotel walking distance to Connaught Place	Very nice hotel with helpful staff and walking distance to Connaught Place
22,1724,Sep 20 2009 	Our home away from home for seven nights	We loved this hotel. It was our home for a total of 7 nights during our 3 week trip to India this summer. The security is very impressive. We felt very safe and secure in a city which is pretty crazy at times. A full breakfast was included. We had most meals in the 24/7 resturant located on the first floor. Desk people were beautifully dressed and very helpful. Room service was immediate. They even knew our names. All issues were addressed promptly. The pool area is breathtaking. Lounge chairs rest in the water. Service was very impressive. We all had our hair cut and other services of the spa which were first rate. The shop owners in the hotel were especially nice. We bought sari's and beautiful scarves from Kashmiri Arts located on the second floor. We stayed at many hotel during our stay which were nice but the Lalit is in a class all its own.
23,1724,"Sep 19 2009 	Impressive !!	Hotel Lalit has beautiful new rooms. Myself and my clients were impressed with the service. Mr Ravindra Kumar, F&amp;B Manager has been very courteous and always make sure that clients go back satisfied and come back to Lalit for their next trip to India. I always impressed with Ravindra. He has been sending regular mails to remind us the interesting events, gala dinners held in The Lalit.. What a great way to be in touch with the clients in various countries..As promised with Ravindra Kumar I recommended my clients to stay for 15 room nights in month of September 2009. Yesterday I got the feedback from the client that service was impressive and Ravindra and other staff of hotel took good care. All my Japanese clients felt like home.. Thank you Lalit and thank you Ravindra.."
24,1724,"Sep 16 2009 	Beautiful hotel	I stayed at the Lalit with my partner during our recent visit to India. The hotel is impressive with high ceiling and modern furishings. Nice facilities especially the swimming pool and gym is equipped with new and good machines. The room is clean and comfortable. The staff are polite. Many nice restaurants in the hotel, breakfast is good with wide spread of food, I had dinner at Wok however food is not up to expectation should be improved with its presentation and taste. Excellent location just minutes away to the famous bengali market."
25,1724,"Sep 15 2009 	Overall satisfactory but some minor problems	We stayed three nights at the Lalit. I had a mixed experience with them during our stay. We had some minor issues besides that everything went well. We had booked through a travel agent and got a good rate for the room inclusive of breakfast.The location of this hotel is really good five minutes from railway station and Connaught Place. It was convenient as shopping and loads of restaurants were around the corner. Taxi charged Rs. 50 and auto rickshaw charged Rs. 20 to go to CP. Taxis were available at all times and rickshaw could be hired from outside the hotel.The lobby is breathtaking with a nice waterfall, huge paintings and pianist, everything in the lobby is spanking brand new. Our room was on the 19th floor with a great view but the room was really old and it was especially visible in the bathroom with old taps, rickety shower, watermarks and chips in the wash basin. We had problems with air conditioning making noises and that got fixed and one day cable went off as well but was fixed promptly. These are very minor issues but for a five star should have been fixed beforehand and it makes a difference between a good and great stay.The breakfast was really good; it was buffet style with both Indian and American options. There are tons of different items and baked goods as well. The food was prepared fresh and had several cooking stations.The attitude of the staff was great and were always willing to help with a smile. Wifi is available for Rs 200 for 30 minutes. I signed up for this twice and used it for about 10 minutes each, but upon checkout they billed for Rupees 850 stating that I used the internet for an hour each but could not explain the charges as I had only signed up for the half an hour option. I was not going to argue over $10 as they said have to check with the IT to find out the problem.We were a bit let down with some little issues, these things are not expected of a hotel trying to compete with Taj or Oberoi. Overall we had a satisfactory stay at the Lalit and will probably stay again because of its great location."
26,1724,"Sep 10 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	On a recent stay I found the Lalit to be a great hotel to stay at in New Delhi. Very modern with a beutiful lobby, great rooms, great restraunts/bar &amp; a lovely pool area. Staff were always very friendly &amp; helpful and the bed was soo comfortable!Pool area very nice with lots of lounges to choose, my only gripe that no alcohol would be served by the pool, so much for my cocktail &amp; a swim! Was about 4 blocks walking distance to shops/market or a few minutes tuk tuk ride for about 40 rupees. Price of food at hotel felt a little over the top for India, though it was beautiful food, the buffet to die for &amp; it should be expected at a 5 star hotel.This hotel deserves it 5 stars, I would stay again, it was a great choice"
27,1724,"Sep 9 2009 	A more intimate 5 star business hotel	Usually stay in The Park or the Imperial but booked into this place for a change. Good gym, small but perfectly formed, with new machines. Bar not too uber trendy or pretentious. Good standard/choice of food on the buffet/a la carte. What I really liked was the feeling that this hotel was not just another huge, anonymous 5 star hotel that you can rattle around in (although it did have approx 500 rooms!). Will definitely use again."
28,1724,Sep 3 2009 	Good service good value for Delhi	Have stayed at the Lalit three times now.The continued updating of the building is good. The pool and terrace were available on this trip and are very nice. A small oasis of calm in the middle of Delhi. Only downside is the piped music can get on your nerves.Staff are friendly and the service is good. Room service food and restaurant a'la Carte menu is always a joy.When we first stayed there it had the largest range in a breakfast buffet I've ever seen. Unfortunately it seems to be getting smaller and relies more on processed and pre-packed products. This might be a minor point but it was an attraction on earlier visits. It is possibly seasonal.WiFi/Internet price is high. Business centre printing prices are extortionate.
29,1724,Aug 28 2009 	Absolutely delightful	I really liked the property. Location is excellent and the hotel is 5 star delux i would say. At the bargain i got it was a steal. The rooms are classy and they upgraded me to their superior room on my request at the reception. Further even a late check out was given .Reception was good and very helpful.
30,1724,"Aug 17 2009 	Nice Hotel good room	This is a nice hotel in the heart of new delhi. I was traveling with my friends. We had a nice rooms.The hotel was helpful with helping us to get information about newdelhi, recommending and booking nice restaurants.But the cups and kettle in the room verey dirty they dont wash it well take care ,,see and wash them good befor you use them.Bathroom verey cute but there is problem in shower basin water is stuck ..Internet verey expensive.."
31,1724,"Jul 27 2009 	Excellent place	Well the rooms were extremely good,staff nice,the 24x7coffee shop great,choice of breakfast was the best I ever had in india.In short...excellent hotel.."
32,1724,"Jul 21 2009	The Best Hotel I Have Stayed At	I initially planned on staying at the Lalit for only a few days in February before moving on to another place, but had such a good experience that I ended up staying here until my trip ended in June.What made my experience memorable was the kind of service that my family and I received. I fell ill on my 2nd or 3rd day and when one of the housekeepers learned of this, he asked if I needed any medical assistance. We told him that I would be fine, and thanked him. Later that evening, I received a phone call from somebody--front desk, I believe--asking how I was feeling. The next morning a manager asked me how I was doing and connected me with a doctor, who prescribed medication for me. Receiving that sort of attention says a lot about their level of service, and it continued after I extended my stay. Everyone from the bottom to the topfrom porters, waiters, and housekeeping to upper management--treated us like we were VIPs. As for the hotel, itself...Just as other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is beautiful and decorated in a contemporary style.The standard rooms are comfortable and of a good size. I liked the furniture and decor. The hardwood floors are a nice touch and also function well in keeping the room cool. After a long, hot day, I would love to return to my room and turn on the large flat-panel TV while sitting on the comfy bed. Although there are plenty of dining options outside of the hotel, the 24/7 &quot;coffee shop&quot; located on the lobby level served all our needs and we rarely bothered eating out. It is run very well, and the service was excellent during my stay. The wait staff was attentive and always very friendly and the chefs, themselves, would often drop by to ask how the food was, eager for feedback. The breakfast buffet is very nice--it's possible that the selection may vary depending on whether or not it's tourist season, but regardless they offer both continental and Indian fare. The bakery next to the 24/7 coffee shop is also nice.There are other restaurants in the hotel, and I must say that the Baluchi restaurant is great. The food is good, and 6 days a week there is live music performed at night. I would sometimes just go there to listen to the ghazals before turning in for the night.The fitness center, which is open 24 hours a day is good, and quite exceptional for a hotel--free weights, machines (including a Smith machine), treadmills and bikes as well as a small yoga/stretching room. Next to the fitness center is the spa and the lovely swimming pool, which opened at the beginning of March.The location is excellent. It is not very far from any of the tourist destinations. In fact, we could see two historic landmarks (India Gate and Humayun's Tomb) from our hotel room window. It is within walking distance of the main Connaught Place circus and a few other markets--the main Connaught Place center, as well as the smaller Bengali and Shankar markets. It is also very close to a metro station. All of these are 5-10 minute walks from the hotel, though there are also plenty of auto rickshaws outside the hotel grounds and along the way if you prefer not to walk.Overall, this hotel has a lot going for it. I had a great experience, and although I had never heard of the Lalit hotel chain prior to my visit, I would most certainly wish to stay there again if I return to Delhi."
33,1724,"Jul 14 2009 	Beautiful Hotel Exceptional Service Great Food	I stayed at the Lalit for a week while in Delhi this past spring and would HIGHLY recommend it to any travelers visiting the city. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff was phenomenal. Overall, it was without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences I've had to date. -StaffThe Lalit's staff is perhaps what sets it apart from other hotels, in that they seem to go above and beyond to be hospitable to the hotel's guests. Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to go out of his/her way to ensure that we were properly taken care of during our stay (especially the wait staff at the 24/7 restaurant downstairs).-RoomsAs far as comfort goes, the Lalit's rooms are what you would expect from any really nice hotel in the US or Europe. What I think set it apart from others was the level of cleanliness (immaculate!) in the room. Also, the room we stayed in was beautifully furnished with modern decor, making it very pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint as well. -LocationThe hotel is located very centrally, in Delhi's Connaught Place district. This was great as we were close to many of the main tourist attractions (Humayun's Tomb, India Gate, etc.), and certainly not far from the others. Given the traffic situation in Delhi, this proved to be very advantageous throughout the trip.-DiningThere are at least two or three restaurants housed in the hotel, however I never ventured beyond its main &quot;24/7 Cafe&quot;, where I ate at least two meals each day. The menu is reasonably-priced and very extensive, offering American, Italian, Japanese, and of course, Indian dishes. Perhaps the best part of the restaurant (aside from the fact that it is open at all hours) was the daily breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of fresh fruits, cheeses, pastries, cereals, eggs/omlettes, and much, much more.-Fitness Center/SpaAlso worth noting is the Lalit's exceptional fitness center, which offers a number of exercise options and wonderful equipment (free weights, weight machines, ellipticals, treadmills). Additionally, they also offer kickboxing classes, as well as yoga. There is also a spa attached, though I did not make use of it.-PoolJust outside the fitness center is a gorgeous outdoor pool, where you can even order food and beverages to snack on while relaxing by the water."
34,1724,"Jul 10 2009 	Pleasant...the best beds this side of delhi	The best bit about the hotel is that even though its in Connaught Place, its still removed enough from the madness. Its all but 10 minutes of walking to CP inner circle and janpath and similar to the metro station. Ideal for the business traveller as much of the Cp business district is like next door.Also refreshing was the room (though the touch up work was little sketchy at places - leaving much to desire) but the rain head shower, the bath tub, the clear class partition between the room and the washroom...was clam and simple.The minibar left much a lot much to desire, i mean 4 cans of soda and two bottles of water, please gimme sm more. The most comfortable bit about my room 2103 was the beds...the best beds i have slept in the mattress was divine to say the least soft but just the right amount, and the pillows again really nice...i had one of the most comfortable night caps ever in a hotel.I tried just a bit of the breakfast and whatever i had was nice...There was some wall patchwork done which was really visible on the bedside, and sm of the woodwork needed a new varnish but it was still a really nice stay. Oh just one more thing maybe maybe they could have a few more ppl at the front desk i, waited a good 15 minutes before the three could maybe tend to my checkout (which was performed by smone other than the actual front desk staff)."
35,1724,"Jun 22 2009 	Excellent 5 Star hotel	Really first cladd hotel, or both business and pleasure, Spotlessly clean, excelent service. The outdoor pool is perfect. Food is good - especially the choice at buffet breakast (so make sure its included in your rate) - fresh fruit, omelettes/eggs cooked to order, Japanese - and of course Indian (so if you'e new to India, this is a safe intro to the joys of dosas, vadi, bhajis, uppam etc!). The Spa is World class too - but priced accordingly (ie its not cheap).The newly renovated rooms on the upper floors have everythig you could ever need - great bathrooms, massive flat screen TV etc.Tip: use black &amp; yellow taxi's to get around (negotiate fixed price) - the Lalits own car may be air-con - but its also at least 5 times as expensive."
36,1724,"Jun 22 2009 	Need to train their support staff	The stay was comfortable, and few support functions were good. I was in Delhi on a business trip and hence did not spend much time in the room though. Had to check in and out more than a couple of times due to my work schedule. Got different rooms each time and therefore was able to experience variety. At the reception, not always is the best room allotted even if requested for. Some support staff are terrible and need severe training. One of the managers at the reception was very helpful, even when the credit card system was not operational. Overall a good experience, but need to put their act together given their positioning."
37,1724,"Jun 18 2009 	Lalit well situated but....	My friend and I stayed here for 4 days in late November. The Lalit was formerly the Intercontinental; it was taken over by Indian hotel magnate Lalit Suri. We had booked our reservation at the Intercon so were surprised to see the Lalit sign and flags in front - we thought the cab driver dropped us at the wrong hotel! It just so happened that we arrived on the day the new name was unveiled.The entrance to the hotel is almost right off the street, so no grounds to speak of. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated with modern flair and some enormous paintings of the Suri family. Check in was smooth, although the staff were not especially pleasant. The hotel has several elevators, but it always seems to be a long wait to catch one.Rooms are modern and well appointed. We stayed in a standard room with 2 double beds - it was a little cramped, but comfortable and clean. The hotel has a very cosmopolitan feel, with travelers from many different countries. We met people from Africa, China, Europe and Australia and the US. It is situated about a 15 min walk to Connaught Place and within short driving distance to many historical and modern attractions. There are some great restaurants and bars serving international fare in Connaught Place - ask the concierge at the hotel to make reservations for you.Our biggest complaint was dining at the Lalit. There is a buffet restaurant to the right of the main lobby, but there wasn't much variety nor was the food very good. We had to wait a long time for a server to take our drink orders, and dishes were not cleared away in a timely manner so ended up crowding our table. There is also a pastry shop that at that time did not sell coffee or small pastries that you could grab on the run. The 24/7 Bar only served food/snacks while the buffet restaurant was open, and it was the same stuff as served in the buffet.We also tried to eat at Woks because we had heard some good things about it, but after waiting 2 hours were still not seated. It got so late we just got take out and took it back to our room. After all that, the food was disappointing - greasy and tasteless. Needless to say, after that we just ate off site.Overall - nice, well kept hotel, well situated. Service was passable. Just find other places to eat."
38,1724,"Jun 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Convenient Part of City	Great large Rooms and ovesized modern bathrooms. Nice views as well. Ate at two of the hotel restuarants, WOK on the top floor surpassed expectations with excellent food, though slow service. The cafe on the 3rd floor was mediocre at best. Service was excellent throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend the hotel for both business and leisure."
39,1724,"Jun 13 2009 	Business friendly hotel	Good business hotel, right in the heart of delhi.situated in the CBD of CP/Barakhamba road and very close to Barakhamba metro station, this hotel smacks of business opulence. I stayed here for almost three months and became and gold member of priority club.The deals are normally around 10k INR per night though it might rise upto 15k in the busy season.it has one of the two heated swimming pools in all of delhi.Okish restaurents but the coffee shop has a lavish spread for breakfast. The best thing about this was the quality of the rooms - lots of gadgets, transparent glasses for bathroom walls and clean look to the entire place.I recommend this."
40,1724,"Jun 7 2009 	Loved the Bathroom	I stayed in the hotel in the month of April '09. The hotel is magnificent and I have just loved the bathroom which has a glass wall. It is so lovely that it was hard to drag myself away from the bath to the room. It was so hot and busy there, I couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the bath. I was expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc. Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that! The hotel lobby is splendid with very good decor &amp; ambience. 3 things I would like the hotel to look into:- The interiors of the rooms need to be done up. In my room the walls hd some cracks &amp; patchwork of painitngs were clearly visible which does not shw the hotel in the right perspective.- The other thing I would like to highlight is that the hotel still does not have a loyalty program &amp; no tie ups with any airlines. This is a little bizarre consideing the tough competition that the industry is in.- Airport pickups &amp; drops are charged......this is something weird I found!! In my view one of the journeys could be charged, but not both!! BUT overall I would say this is probably the best hotel I have stayed in off late. Perhaps not the most convenient if you have business in Gurgaon!! But if you want to mix of good food, service with the odd trip to connaught place then this is an absolute must!!Do pay heed to my suggestions....Lalit will definitely go a long way in fulfilling Mr. Lalit Suri's dreams!!"
41,1724,Jun 4 2009 	Great service	I was at The Lalit during a period of 2nights. I visited Delhi for business purpose and decided to be put up at The Lalit. My decision was wise as the service rendered was very pleasing.The staff was extremely courteous. The food was authentic and delicious. I was extremely happy with their service &amp; I shall always recommend The Lalit to everybody.
42,1724,"Jun 3 2009 	Best for Business events	- Stay is calm- Staff very good- Excellent place for business events- Food, excellent and having real taste of India- Location: in middle of Delhi- Airport is just 30 to 40 minutes away."
43,1724,Jun 3 2009 	nice stay	Much more than expected. I went Delhi to attend a national meeting. My company opted me to stay at hotel lalit. The ambience of hotel is very gud. Service is very fast and courteous.I liked the food and dining of this hotel very much.
44,1724,"Jun 2 2009 	Great new location old refurnished classy hotel	the Lalit is the newer version of the Old Intercontinental hotel which used to be there. taken over by a new management, this hotel is very much up to the mark.great place to be, an absolute 5 star...ciaoronak"
45,1724,Jun 2 2009 	Advantage Location	This hotel is in heart of Delhi and is the best in terms of location and logistics.The food in all the returants at this place is fingerlicking good.The rooms are sufficently large with spacious washrooms.The gym and the spa at this place is really good.Overall this is a good hotel in the heart of Delhi
46,1724,"May 22 2009 	Looks good but too many niggles ...	February 2009 saw my first stay at the renovated Lalit after several stays there in the 'old days'. On arrival the hotel looks very impressive but it didn't really live up to expectations due to a number of small problems. Check in was very slow and complicated which was very frustrating as we arrived at 10:30pm. I was travelling with an Indian colleague and we both had to endure a lengthy (and unnecessary) form filling exercise which apparently is part of their procedures. Although the hotel has been renovated the old lifts remain which are rather slow and one of my pet hates. The rooms have been very well decorated with comfortable beds and a huge flat screen television. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the proximity to the railway station can make for a rather noisy night. Although very busy I have to say that breakfast is superb with an enormous array of food to cater for all tastes and dietary requirements. Another problem came on check out where I was significantly UNDERCHARGED on my bill and had to wait until it was corrected. Overall you will be comfortable and well looked after at the Lalit, they just need to work a bit harder on some of the smaller things, particularly at reception."
47,1724,"May 21 2009 	Grand .....	I thought the hotel was stunning .... i can see on the site that people had poor service well that was not experience ... there was a missing bathrobe in my room one day which I needed to go the swimming I had one in less than 5mn upon request.I used all the services the gym , the spa, the swimming pool, the traditional Indian restaurant everything was a delight.... Considering it was 43C when I visited the hotel was a peaceful and refreshing haven from the bustle and heat from the city"
48,1724,"May 20 2009 	Not really a good hotel to stay	I found their services to be very poor and staff reluctant to entertain the guests. The locker in the room was not working and at reception I asked them to keep my passport. They retorted by telling me that I should keep the passport in locker in the room. When I told them locker is not working, they said sorry but they can't keep. They didn't either change the room or got the locker repaired.This hotel is near by a railway station and it was difficult to sleep with trains hooting away whole night."
49,1724,May 10 2009 	Perfect Business Spot	It is the perfect Business hotel in the heart of the city. The hotel has a great SPA which you should visit and use the facility. The resturant has a big spread of menu and food is average. Lot of place to hang around near by and shopping too.
50,1724,"May 6 2009 	Loved the new decor of hotel	Visited this hotel on a business visit and was very pleased with the arrangements. The hotel is just renovated and its a great atmosphere to mix business with pleasures in that hotel. Rooms are very good and I enjoyed the stay. The only problem here is the STAFF not friendly, the room service takes a lot of time and most of the time the staff is too confused if you ask them anything, they are a bit rude a bit attitude problem I can say. Overall well equipped, good food, great bar a perfect place for business if they have a better staff."
51,1724,May 2 2009 	love 24/7	i like the overall experience ...and moreover i visit 24/7 very frequently ..im in love with it totally...coz you get liquor there 24/7 ..name suggests all ...
52,1724,May 1 2009 	Good Hotel for a Business Traveller	A good-quality business hotel in a convenient location with excellent dining options.
53,1724,"Apr 29 2009 	Hate the place	This was a crazy stay. Was booked for two nights with my family, but it was possibly the worst stay ever.Checkin etc was smooth, but the first evening, the air conditioner for the entire hotel went off. There was some scheduled maintenance going on and was supposed to go on for a couple of hours initially, but it went on till the next afternoon.In Delhi's heat, this five star hotel gave us a torrid time. The staff ran out of fans and we could not even open our window.The staff did not help much. I ended up arguing with them regarding the fare they were charging me. They had the gall to present me with a full bill on check out. It made me furious.Terrible, terrible, terrible.One positive thing about the hotel is it's good location. If you are willing to walk a few steps, CP is almost next door."
54,1724,"Apr 28 2009 	Better After Renovation	The Lalit has come up with a New Look after Renovation , The Rooms are Much better and location as usual is good Close to many of the offices. The Restaurant is also very nice"
55,1724,"Apr 25 2009 	Great Experience	In totality it was a great experience. Food, stay was really satisfying and to add to that, slept really well after a really long work schedules. Service at the restaurant was good. The Hotel was very secure too."
56,1724,"Apr 25 2009 	Great place	Stayed in the presidential suite for 1 night due to unavailability of space. Rate of 400 USD per night, did not matter since my client was paying! It was one of the best experiences of my life. The complementary wine, the jacuzzi and the rest of the services were first class. The brekfast was excellent as well. The decor was fantastic and the location of the hotel is perfect for access to central New Delhi. Recommended for anyone wanted to stay in an upmarket place"
57,1724,"Apr 20 2009 	Dont touch the mini bar!	Goes without saying I suppose, but tired and frazzled after a days travel the thought of a reviving G&amp;T is irresistble until you clock the prices in this hotel . R900for a gin or other spirit then add tax on top. They know how to charge here. Also beware of the buffet, average though it is, costs R1770. You expect excellent service at this price, but it took over an hour before I could get into my room as the wrong key card was issued 3 times."
58,1724,"Apr 17 2009 	intercontinental touch is missing...	While, I had been going in this hotel for a while, this was part of the priority club and now probably independent and named as Lalit. The intercontinental touch is gone, the service level has gone down and I found the people to be more aloof than before. Their breakfast used to be one of the very best and very exhaustive. They were able to amintain that so far, however I see people are little disoriented now. The maintanance of their gym and swimming pool is also going poor now."
59,1724,"Apr 17 2009 	Lalit good value for money	The Lalit has been through a major overhaul and the renovated rooms are well appointed with large flat TVs, glass walled bath and shower area and a huge glass window to give a view of the city.Elevators are still being upgraded to the wait is sometimes longer.Food was not upto the standards of the old hotel (Intercontinental). Breakfast was boring with only one fresh juice and one canned juice option. Usual eggs and sausage (no smoked salmon) and Indian parathas and dosas etc.The mini bar has flavoured water for Rs 175/- which is a total rip off. The hotel only gives you 2 small bottles of water per day which is not adequate.Staff is a bit uncertain at times, check out took a long time.All in all a good hotel at a modest price in New Delhi's Connaught Place area."
60,1724,"Apr 16 2009 	Very good hotel - would recommend it.	Just back from a 4 night stay at The Lalit. Very impressed with the hotel - pick up from airport and check in were very smooth and quick and staff were all very friendly and eager to help. Really good location - very easy to get a taxi/auto rickshaw or even walk up to Connaught Place. The doormen were always ready to get you a taxi and not push the hotel cars.We had two double rooms on the 21st floor and, although you could see the railway line from one room, the noise from the trains was very distant and did not bother us at all. The rooms were very well equipped - the only thing lacking was the usual hotel guide, although there was a room service menu. The bathroom was very nice, but the mini bar was very sparsely stocked - only things in the fridge were one can each of coke and fanta!! (although they did provide 4 bottles of water every day). Breakfast was very good and we ate at the 24/7 lobby restaurant one night which was very nice, although the continual repeating chillout music got on your nerves after a while.My daughters really enjoyed the pool area - in particular the lovely lounging chairs on the edge of the pool and my eldest and myself used the spa and thoroughly enjoyed it - very reasonably priced, too. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if in New Delhi. Had a really nice short break on the whole and we were not harrassed half as much as we expected even though my 18 yr old has long blonde hair and attracted lots of 'friendly stares' and lots of requests for photographs!"
61,1724,"Apr 10 2009 	great breakfast spacious clean room too much noise from trains	excellent hotel in terms of cleanliness, service, quality of food (especially at breakfast) and safe. However, too close to train station, so lots of noise all night and day. Good location though."
62,1724,Apr 6 2009 	NAIL IN THE MAIN BED..GOT HURT DR IN HOTEL GAVE AN ANTI TITANUS INJECTION	nail in the frame of the main bed which hurt me in the leg..a Dr was summoned and who gave an anti titanus injection...later i found other rooms carpertners banging away at the beds as they may have had the same problem also the hotel is too close to a railway station with trains hooting away day and night..
63,1724,"Apr 5 2009	Nice Comfortable Hotel Room for Improvement	We stayed three nights in total with a wedding party. The hotel's decor is very impressive and modern. The rooms are comfortable and we had nice views of the city. The breakfast is decent but I've had better at similar level of hotels.The pool area is also newly renovated and is very nice. But I almost wished that it's indoor because the air in Delhi is just so polluted that it wasn't very enjoyable breathing in all the fumes and pollution while relaxing at the pool.The major complaint that I have is on the service. Check-in is extremely slow. If there were two or three people in front of you on line, be prepared to wait for over 20 minutes just to check in. We had to check in twice because our three nights were split up and both times we had similar experience.Also staff at front desk seem confused sometimes. One time a front desk person actually told me the wrong information regarding hours of the sauna room in the gym area. Another time I wanted to break a large bill and the person sent me down the desk to another area but ended with no one helping me. Despite the hiccups in service, it was a comfortable hotel and I would stay here again if I could get a good deal on a room."
64,1724,"Mar 29 2009 	Good could do with some improvements	I stayed at this Hotel for one night on a Business Trip to Delhi. Hotel is quite centrally located, thats a major plus point.Crowded Lobby, Check in was chaotic, took some time to get my room allocated. Staff seemed confused and unable to handle large crowds at the same time.Room was nice and spacious, excellent view of the city, large comfortable bed, clean and large bathroom. Room Amneties were excellent. They even had cellphone chargers for most models in the room. Tried out room service for dinner. Order arrived on time, Food was good, not excellent.Breakfast spread the next morning was basic, not something to write home about. The Lunch buffet was however excellent, though expensive.There are two things that I did not like about the Hotel.1. The staff tend to linger around waiting for tips, it happened to me thrice during my stay. This irritated me quite a lot.2. Though Recession has brought down Hotel Tariffs, the rates for the all the other services and facilities remain the same. It seems stupid to pay over inflated prices for almost everything when the same thing is available outside for 1/10th the price. So even though I was travelling on company expense, it pinched.overall an average experience. recommended for Business travel only."
65,1724,"Mar 26 2009 	Luxury Hotel Superb Location! Loved It!!!!!!	I've just stayed at the Lalit with my family for 2 nights in March.. This hotel is definately worth it's points. The minute u walk in to the lobby, the features and decor are very modern. The service was great, I couldn't say a bad thing about it, the pool area was lovely, my kids loved it. I've stayed in some 5 star hotels before, but this was even better than the ones we've stayed in London. You wouldn't be disappointed, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There was alot of business people around, but on our second day there was a few more families. There is a pastry shop in the hotel which is not to badly priced, but other than that we ordered drinks at the poolside bar, which was very steep. We had breakfast in the 24/7 restaurant, which was lovely, it was probably the best meal my kids had had since we had been in India. There was such a wide range, to cater for all. The hotel also had agradin area, where daytime shows were on, also on the second floor the hotel has a range of boutiques and gift shops. The best thing about the Lalit was the location. It is literally 5 minute walk from Connaught Place, 5 minute car jouirney to the train station and it only took us half an hour in peak time to the Airport. Overall, I would say I made a very good choice staying at the Lalit. I'd been looking for accomadtion for nearly 2 months prior to my journey. Having 3 young children, I wanted a nice hotel, with a good pool and in a good location. I had firstly booked the Radisson, but cancelled last minute due to it's location. Lalit was definately very impressive!"
66,1724,"Mar 8 2009 	The Lalit: A magnificent surprise in a great Delhi location	I spent 4 days at this hotel in mid-Feb with my wife and son. The hotel was arranged by our Delhi office so I was a little surprised it was not a brand that I recognized....but boy, what an absolutely outstanding experience! While every aspect of my experience was great, with no negatives, here are the highlights:1. The people were the best thing about this hotel.....they were warm, friendly, polished and VERY hospitable. They made us feel really welcome and service was excellent at every place. (I thought they had mistaken me for some VIP, but my wife and son had the same experience). 2. The rooms were very nice..... bright, tastefully furnished, fairly large, and very well equipped. 3. The 24/7 restaurant is probably the best &quot;coffee shop&quot; I have experienced.....great food, served beautifully, in a very pleasant setting. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. While we had intended to eat out and try Delhi's many restaurants, we ended up eating here pretty much all the time, . 4. The facility overall was beautiful.....it was rich without seeming formal; very bright, airy, beautifully decorated, with a collection of art by top Indian artists. (It's the only hotel I know of that has a full-time curator! ).5. The location was superb....right in Connaught Place, in central Delhi. It is hard to find a better location in Delhi. It is close to shopping, business, government, parliament, the historic old Delhi, the newer monuments, etc.. Given Delhi's traffic congestion, that was a major boon. I understand that the hotel has been recently renovated, which I am sure added to its attractiveness, but I have to believe that the outstanding service and flawless operation we experienced was the result of excellent management. (And you could see them all over the place all the time!). Bottom line, a superb hotel we would gladly recommend to our friends."
67,1724,"Mar 8 2009 	Loved this hotel	I loved this hotel! I've travelled a lot and this would have to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The room was fabulous, the staff were very attentive and helpful. The buffet was amazing - breakfast lunch and dinner and room service was spot on. The room was quiet, it had an ironing board - the only hotel I came across in India that had one!!! Attention to detail was excellent in the room - variety of newspapers, chocolates - all I can say was it was fantastic. Only downside was the pool was still closed for renovation, and the restaurant was a little expensive, but overall - I'd highly recommend it."
68,1724,"Feb 18 2009 	Recently renovated but pool is closed.	Nicely renovated hotel. Good size rooms. Excellent interior decor. Somewhat noisy, even though our room was on a high floor. The hotel is right at the heart of the city. Dining is open 24/7, and breakfast is a tremendous feast. Pool is currently being renovated so is closed; gym is small but functional."
69,1724,Feb 4 2009 	a treat	When we first arrived in New Delhi we stayed at the Shangri-La but found it to be rather cold &amp; standoffish. When we returned to new Delhi we went to check in at Shangri-La again but found they's increased the nightly rate over 25% or 120 USD in less than 2 weeks. We looked around and found La Lit to be the most reasonable luxury hotel that were willing to negotiate a fair price. The newly renovated rooms were stunning &amp; almost identical to rooms at the Shangri-La. We found the hotel atmosphere a lot friendlier and more welcoming and always bustling with locals and travellers. The breakfat buffet was outstanding! If given the choice would definately stay at La Lit! Would highly recommend this hotel- a real treat.
70,1724,"Feb 3 2009 	Excellently-designed city hotel dismal service	We stayed at the Lalit recently on a visit to Delhi. The hotel has a lot of strong points...the design is top-notch: rooms are spacious, comfortable and fitted with high-quality and modern finishings/furnishings - you get what you pay for. The hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place shopping and dining, metro stations and even some other sites of interest. The 24/7 restaurant downstairs is fantastic, offering one of the best selections of food I have seen at a hotel in India. The major let-down were the poor response to some of the simply requests we had made, such as a packed breakfast, water, information, etc...I was expecting better. Extra services are mostly overpriced and poor in quality, as well. Overall, the accomodation represents the price you pay in an expensive city like Delhi, but they really need to work on their confused, disinterested staff. I did not encounter any signs of renovation work during my stay. Maybe it is over?"
71,1724,Jan 2 2009 	Impressed!	This hotel is now called &quot;The Lalit - New Delhi&quot;.I stayed at this hotel for four nights. The hotel was under renovation at the time of my stay (including rooms and public spaces). I stayed in a recently renovated room. The room was very nice. Service throughout my stay was excellent. I ordered room service once (excellent and reasonably priced) and had multiple meals in the lobby dining area (24/7). The breakfast buffet is a decent value although the lunch buffet is very pricey (~$40/pp).I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
72,1724,"Dec 22 2008 	Avoidable hotel	My experience was similar to that of Isabella. I stayed last week for 3 nights.Lobby and rooms are fine like most economical 5 stars but the hotel is undergoing major repair and therefore very noisy. Though the management always says that the work is mostly over or they stop work in the night if guests object etc but the fact is throughout the day and night carpenters, electricians and masons keep working and stop for 15 minutes if you object repeatedly and then resume work again which at times is very noisy. Very difficult to find restful sleep in this hotel. Besides, the hotel is very close to the train tracks and train make a big siren to keep people away from passing the tracks.Staff is a mixed lot, some are very polite and some very rude.Avoidable hotel."
73,1724,"Dec 18 2008 	Worth the price...if the price is mid-market	My experience was most similar to IsabellaNewYork in her review below. There are some real nice touches in this hotel: recently-renovated rooms are modern and attractive with a big flatscreen TV and funky bathrooms. Also, the morning breakfast was very good, and I didn't have the service problems that others had. In fact, it seems like the staff may have recently had a training course, since they were frequently extremely solicitous. I would add that there is also a nice gym on the mezzanene floor that is open 24/7.On the other hand, this is still a work in progress. I can report that, as of late December, the loud bangings associated with continued renovations are ongoing, though I never experienced it late at night. Also, my room (like IsabellaNewYork's) was on the side with the train station, and while I got used to the constant whistles, it would be a much better experience on the other side of the building. Having traveld to India in the immediate aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, I was able to negotiate a much cheaper rate than TripAdvisor is listing (my rate was about $180), which I think is a very good deal given the high price of business hotels in Delhi and the many near-5-star ammenities this hotel offers.As others have noted, this hotel has shed its association with the InterContinental chian and is now called the Lalit New Delhi. All cabbies seem to know it as the InterContinental still, however."
74,1724,"Dec 2 2008 	Really good Hotel	This is really excellent hotel, with exception: they did some works by night and there was more dust on the floor in front of hotel (in the morning). I came in Hotel very often early in the morning (01.00 - 03.00 o'clock) and must walking under the wall-workers -construction), on the other entrance and so on.Service was OK, food, people are very kind."
75,1724,Nov 22 2008	Overpriced	The hotel has some great plusses and a few major negatives. Reception staff do not seem able to cope and are quite rude and off hand. Checking in is slow and my luggage took nearly forty minutes to arrive after completing the formalities. The lift service is totally inadequate. I regularly waited over five minutes for a lift to arrive (either on the lobby level or on the 18th floor where my room was located) and then it stopped at nearly every floor. The 24/7 restauant (main cafe style buffet eatery) serves excellent food but is very expensive compared to other indian hotels - rip off levels. The bedroom was superb with every comfort imaginable and excellent bathroom. Good location but the overall package could be so much better.
76,1724,"Nov 6 2008	Nice stay	The hotel has been recently renovated. The new look is very contemporary. Our stay was great, the rooms have a very modern look. The front facing rooms have a beautiful views. The bathrooms are very spacious. The restaurants especially 24/7 and Baluchi are very good."
77,1724,"Oct 21 2008 	awefull	This is a rip off joint. I have stayed in hotels ranging 3 star to 7 stars but this is the only one which wouldn't give any star ever. They charge like they are the best hotel in new delhi but other than that they have nothing. I'd have been better off in a B&amp;B for 2000Rs. Thats how much I think they should charge.No customer service, aweful food, construction and wierd check in process on 3-4th floor. The lady was good looking though.Thanks"
78,1724,"Oct 16 2008	Problematic hotel with potential	Service in this hotel is hit and miss. Sometimes excellent and friendly, sometimes incompetent and rude. Overall, the hotel definitely has a long way to go to provide a consistent 5 star experience. Room was nice and very modern, with flat screen TV and a futuristic bathroom. Room had absurdly loud noise coming from a nearby commuter railway station. Trains were making piercing signals at all hours to warn people off the tracks. Have never experienced such noise levels in a hotel room, despite years of travelling around Asia. If you stay in this hotel, make sure to get a room away from the railway station!Hotel is 5 minutes walking distance from Connaught Place, a big shopping area that is dirty and has been decaying for decades. The area is nevertheless popular with tourists, and has a couple of decent restaurants.A couple of nights I was woken up around 1 am from loud banging that went on for a couple of hours: extensive renovation work is going on in the hotel at all hours.Breakfasts were excellent. Nice, bright restaurant and wide food selection. Staff sometimes seem tired and unmotivated. Getting a coffee refill is often a challenge.Dinner in the same restaurant was a depressing affair. When I pointed out that a particular vegetable was missing from the pizza despite being mentioned on the menu, the waiter silently took the plate away. He returned about seven minutes later, having added the missing vegetables on the original dish. The pizza by now was cold and even less appetizing. Another time, a salad in the main restaurant was mediocre.Room service was disappointing, to say the least. &quot;Grilled vegetables'&quot; turned out to be an unappetizing soup-like dish that was inedible. A sandwich was soggy an also unappetizing. Coffee was so weak it looked like weak tea. It is very hard to believe that any professionally trained chef could have had any hand in this food fiasco!Internet in the room is horrendously expensive, at 1.248 rupees including tax (more than 26 USD!). The login-process is clunky and sometimes problematic.Elevators are often malfunctioning, and there are often long waiting times.Indian newspapers have reported that starting next year, this hotel will no longer be part of the Intercontinental chain."
79,1724,"Sep 14 2008 	Exellent hotel	This is a very good quality hotel, excellent facilities, huge, beautiful rooms, very clean, spectacular breakfasts, good restaurants, good service, very safe, knowledgeable staff. Would definitely go there again."
80,1724,"Aug 23 2008 	under renovation for at least one month or two !	We booked in this hotel for 2 nights in august to have some restfrom busy india, during august in delhi choose a hotel with swimming pool if possible its so hot !Well the reservation office forgot to tell us that the whole building and swimming was under renovation, that means dust and noise we chose a standard room, they gave us a suite but when the door lift opened, clouds of dust and noise invaded the corridor, it was like a joke movie.... we ran away from the hotelI wouldnt recommend this hotel for its lack of information or sincerity..."
81,1724,"May 20 2008 	Totally Horrible Service	Stayed there from 16-19 May. It was horrible experience. The staff was unfriendly. I arrived in the hotel at midnight. When I lined up for check-in at 3rd floor, the staff gave a head signal to the bellboy and asked him to take me to international club at 20th flr for check-in. That was really rude. She didn't even bother to say anything to me. The hotel is going through renovations. I could hear the noise/bang sound when I woke up in the morning. I still could hear the bang when I came back to the hotel before dinner time. The TV and telephone in my room didn't work at all. I used my international mobile to call receptionist and informed her that telephone in my room didn't work. All TV channels, except one, had no signals. It took forever for them to fix this.Unless the hotel upgrades their quality of service and improves its staff etiquette and professionalism, this hotel does not deserve to be called 'class hotel'.I really hate this hotel and will never recommend it to my friends and networks!"
82,1724,"May 15 2008	Best value ""good"" hotel in Delhi great gym.	The intercontinental is my hotel of choice for Delhi. In an expensive city, it offers good value. As already noted, the renovations are not too disturbing.The rooms are fantastic and the hotel's best feature. Most if not all have plasma tvs and great bathrooms. The gym/spa is fantastic and a great way to finish the day. The restaurant is also excellent, open 24 hours (and experienced this by ordering a steak at 3am - perfect) and the bars offer a wide choice. The location is brilliant and if you dont want to pay c.200, this is a great option."
83,1724,"May 13 2008 	Beware of the renovations!	Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days R&amp;R and sightseeing at the end of a business trip in the region and have to say I was disappointed.The location of the hotel is great, on the edge of the Government district of new Delhi but within very easy walking distance of Connaught Place - but the quality did not live up to my expectations of an Inter-continental.The main thing to frustrate me was that the hotel is currently in the midst of major renovations. The lobby is reduced to being a corridor - some of the lifts are out of action and significantly, the pool and surrounding area is completely a building site. The pool is to be closed for 3-4 months apparently. Hammering and drills started at 8 in the morning and carried on until late at night. Worst of all however - even though I only booked 2-3 weeks before travle, I was told none of this and there was no mention on the hotel website.I did stay in one of the renovated rooms and it was very nice (if slightly small) but there were clearly teething problems. My broadband wouldn't work so I had to call a guy to come and set me up with a separate connection each time I needed to go on line. And the cost of the broadband was extortionate! The 24hour restaurant was unaffected by the renovation but the food was ok at best - breakfast was a big disappointment. Room service was polite and prompt with a good selection, but again food quality was average at best.In summary, great central location, with the potential to be great - but get the renovations out the way first, and then expect to pay over the odds for average food and service"
84,1724,"Apr 10 2008 	The Level of Service is Impressive	I am on a PC points stay at this property. As an Royal Ambassador, this is the best value in the system. The level of service and attention to detail is extrordinary. My sense is tht they deeply care about the people staying at the hotel. Because I am here for medical reasons, the location of this hotel is ideal -- 2 blocks from Bengali Market. 3 Blocks from connaught place.The rennovated rooms are very nice if you don't want a suite. I would opt for an executive suite or luxury suite in the Presidential tower. I stayed 2 nights in 1115. Very quiet. looks over the pool (now close d for rennovation). But the two luxury suites on the 21st floor are good for sleeping. Room 2121 has a great view of the cricket fields at the Modern school, and the view wraps around. It's pretty spectacular.If you are an PC Ambassador, the club lounge has breakfast 8-10:30, tea 3-5, and cocktails 6:30-8:30. It is on the 20th floor right below 2121. The 21st floor presidential rooms have no one on top of you. They are very quiet--but not yet rennovated.The elevators are under wraps right now so sometimes you might have to wait. But the new spa, steam room, suana and gym portend a bright future for this property once it is completely rennovated."
85,1724,"Mar 2 2008 	Comfortable stay.	Stayed at &quot;The Grand&quot; from 25th to 28th Feb. We had travelled up from Goa and looked forward to our first trip to Delhi. I had pre paid for the room and check in was efficient and professional. I requested a renovated room and was given a beautifully apointed room on the 11th floor. Rm 1127. The room was very confortable and you can request harder pillow if the soft pillows are not to your liking. I was already aware of the ongoing renovations but wasn't aware that the pool is also closed. It didn't affect our stay as the visit was short. We availed of the buffet meals every day and the quality was excellent if not a little expensive by Indian standards. The location is excellent and it is only a short walk to Connaught Place. We also walked to India Gate. Taxis are easy to to arrange with the consierge staff. The only &quot;not so positive&quot; incident happened at checkout. I was given my bill and the hotel had again charged me for the accomodation that I had already pre paid. I didn't notice until I had left the desk. I returned to the desk and pointed out the error. The situation was recitified but it was done with a grimace from the desk. I was not offered an apology or an explanation. However, I have booked again to stay from 3rd to the 6th June 2008. I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Delhi. The renovations are hardly noticable and the staff are generally professional and helpful.Ken Brydon and PJ Hogan"
86,1724,"Feb 22 2008 	In spite of ongoing renovations - a class hotel	Over the past several years I have stayed at the Grand on at least five occasions - and if it was as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be, I would not have stayed there as often as I did. In fact, for New Delhi it is very good. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza (Friends Colony), Le Meridien, the Maurya Sheraton and the Imperial, and for comfort, value and service, it is the equal of all but the Imperial, which I rate as one of the world's great hotels. The renovated club rooms are superb.No doubt it is expensive, nearly $500 a night for a renovated club during a high demand period (during an international trade fair), but similar hotels in New Delhi are even more expensive. When I visited, the hotel was still undergoing renovations - the lobby was restrictive and the pool closed. However, other than that there were no impositions on the guests. The Indian restaurant (Baluchi?) on the third floor was superb and good value for a 5 star hotel in New Delhi. The Chinese Restaurant on the roof top was disappointing. The 24/7 bar in the lobby has gone modern (glass and clean lines) and not to my taste - I preferred the old Champions Sports Bar which it replaced. Having said that, it is a good watering hole, excellent service, good selection of drinks and best of all, open 24 hours a day.For the business traveller this is a very good hotel - good rooms (renovated ones), good service and good location. I would also recommend this hotel for the tourist, especially if they can get a discounted rate. A very satisfactory hotel, indeed."
87,1724,"Feb 18 2008 	Good for business travellers and tourist	This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Delhi. Facilities are good, even if at the present time (02/2008), some refurbishing work is causing some limited access to the lobby. I have used the internal travel agency to arrange a one day tour of the town and I have been very pleased of the service offered. I paid 1000 rupees (20$) for a full day group tour; it turned out that the group was only a party of three and the guide was excellent, he spoke a good english, was very well prepared and ready to answer any question. I have also tried two internal restuarants, offereng respectively indian and chinese food. A little bit pricey (50$ for a good dinner, without wine) but still acceptable. Main negative point is the noise from the nearby railway line, quite loud.Overall I can recommend this hotel to both business travellers and tourists."
88,1724,"Jan 26 2008 	Not worth the high cost	The hotel is undergoing some major construction. The lobby is not really a lobby with the construction going on. The taxi and rickshaw drivers have a tough time finding this place for some reason. We were put in a room that is not renovated yet. It was ok, but the renovated section looks so much better. The rooms are very spacious. The hotel seems to be more of a business type hotel. It just didn't justify the price we paid for it.The concerige service is not very helpful and quite unfriendly. The room service and restaurants are very good. Everything I ordered was very tasty. I don't think I would stay here again."
89,1724,"Jan 10 2008 	Fantastic	After reading the mixed reviews on here I had fairly low expectations about this hotel. In fact it was a fantastic surprise. The renovation works continue but are now of minimum disruption and the newly refurbished areas are really great, with very modern and cool design. The reception area was not completely finished although even here you can see how good it's going to look. We were given one of the refurbished rooms on the 21st floor and it was very cool with great piture window, modern interior design, giant LCD TV and DVD, cool bathroom with seperate rainshower.The heated (useful in January) outdoor swimming pool on one of the hotel's roofs is a real bonus as it's wonderful to escape to this tranquil space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Delhi city centre. It was dissapointing that the spa was more or less out of service, with just some basic facilities available. The hotel's website is kept up to date with what is and is not available during the works though.The Grill restaurant on the top floor has a great menu and they're happy to make something off menu for you if you ask. The quality's great. Breakfast's also top notch. I stayed in the Taj Palace a few weeks earlier and much prefered the Intercontinental Grand. It's much cooler, has more buzz and a better location all for a similar price."
90,1724,"Dec 28 2007	Expensive ( 314/night) - in Indian comparison	This place is way too expensive by India comparison. And by international comparison as well. Even in Tokyo you can stay at cheaper price and with more comforts.LOCATIONNote that there is anotehr The Grand New Delhi in the city as well. This place has nothing to do with Intercontinental The Grand. Taxi driver may have problems finding this place even though it is supposedly centrally located. So have the address at hand. And even if you have the address taxies may not find the place. Intercontineltal The Grand states it is on the Marakhambra Avenue, off Connaught Place. In reality it is some 700 metres from Connaught Place and not on Marakhambra Avenue but on a small side street off it and next to the highway and very close to the railway. You can here the trains passing by in rooms facing east.ROOMSStay away of the old rooms at all cost. The new rooms are very very nice (see prictures). However at over 300 per night these are way too expensive. Especially by international comparison. Furthermore, hotels on Jampath are more centrally located - and some of them cheaper.HOTEL PREMISESThe lobby area was undergoing a major refurbisment in December 2007. Check in facilities were crammed to one corner while the whole otherwise big lobby was closed off for renovations. Pool area is a serous need of renovation as well. Gladly the pool was heated. Restaurant on the ground floor is of international standard - but at similar of even higher prices.RECOMMEDATIONInstead of the big international names I would look for a 3 star Indian operated place close to Jampath. You'd get more value for you money - at a fraction of the cost."
91,1724,"Nov 28 2007	Short stay in a flash one	The room rate was extortionate (US$550/night plus taxes) but the room was incredible. How the team here made a small room into a masterpiece of open space architecture is incredible. The illusion of a large room is great. If you are a Hotel Architect, go here and check out the magic.Very impressed with the small things too like International Power Plugs as standard!The renovations down stairs were still on and that also affected the Gym setting. The pool meshed over is an interesting concept but it does not keep out the smog!.The breakfast setting was stunning and the ground floor restaurant is brilliant. There is tons of choice for food at breakfast here.Loved it...except for the room rate!ProsBest room setting for standard hotelBreakfast!Service was exceptional in all aspectsConsRoom price"
92,1724,"Nov 21 2007 	Avoid at all costs!	Stayed on 18th Nov fortunately for only one night. As foyer is being rebuilt we were sent to a waiting area on first floor to check in. This backed on to the works and we were seperated by only a short wallfrom the building going on. It was extremeley dusty and noisy. One worker was arc welding a few feet from where we were sitting! The man who came to check us in was oblivious to the problem. We were in the unmodernised rooms. These are disgraceful. The carpets were badly stained and sticky. The bath was badly rusted around the waste and looked dirty. The new rooms may be nice but the old ones would do shame to a one star hotel. We went into the restaurant to see if we could have a meal. We were told that only meal available was Sunday Brunch. Thiis was a buffet costing 3,000 rupees each (about 40 ). We had no alternative but to go for this as there are no nearby restaurants. 20 minutes after going in we were told that the buffet was closing in 2 minutes. Sure enough in 2 minutes they started to clear away the food. No one had bothered to tell us that the buffet was about to close when we went in. We were still charged the 3.000 rupees.Do not go near this hotel!"
93,1724,Nov 14 2007	The Intercontinental The Grand Delhi	We stayed at the Intercontinental during a short business trip intending to stay longer when the trip was ended but we changed our minds. The new rooms are big and have a glass walled see through bathroom but not a single mirror lit properly to apply make up in my case or shave in my husbands case -too trendy by half. A plasma screen TV not programmed in in either room we stayed in. The main problem alongside the constant renovation is that there is no decent outside space.The terrace by the dining room could be nice but has an extractor fan from the kitchen fed directly onto it and the poolside is grubby and meshed over and is not welcoming. For a business stay make it short and for a holiday go to a hotel with an outside space or a garden.Ask for a room overlooking the pool - otherwise the railway station keeps you awake all night.
94,1724,"Nov 10 2007	Great Stay	I was in new Delhi for business and stayed at the Intercontinental Grand. I think that this hotel is great! I was upgraded to a Club Room with free breakfast. I love the contemporary feel of the Intercontinental. Although it is undergoing renovations, my stay was very comfortable. Staff are great and I have really nothing to complain about. The chauffered mercedez car that we hired from the hotel for 3 days also made our journey through meetings in New Delhi very easy and the driver has great knowledge of the area. He brought us to interesting tourist areas in between our meetings. The Wok restaurant at the 28 level has amazing food. The breakfast served at &quot;24/7&quot; restaurant was adequate."
95,1724,"Nov 7 2007 	Rip of	After reading other reviews, I got a renovated room, so far so good. The decoration is Ok for a 5 star hotel. Service I received was only 2 star class worth, for exemple the shower was not ounes cleaned during my stay, also they never vacuumed the room. The breakfast was very basic. The rate for such hotel + service is a real rip of."
96,1724,"Oct 28 2007 	On its way up.	I stayed at the Intercontinental - The Grand last week for 2 mights while in Delhi on business. Its the second time I've stayed in this hotel, the first time was about 2-3 years ago, and its definately improving.A few words of warning. The hotel is currently under rennovation, and so the lobby is a real mess. Its all boarded up and there is no where to sit. They told me that 3/4 of the rooms have already been rennovated, and I was upgraded from a regular king room to a &quot;club&quot; room. From my room I wasn't disturbed by the noise of the rennovations, but the smell of paint in the lobby is almost overwhelming. They also told me rennovations will be complete by March 2008, so keep all this in mind.I remember from the last time I was there the rooms were typical Indian old style, carpet on the floors and classic furniture. They were nice rooms but they were nothing fancy. Certainly well below what you would expect from an Intercontinental. But the rennovated rooms are absolutely superb. Parquet floors, a bed that was on par with Shangrila beds (which are my usual favorite), modern decorations, a 42&quot; plasma TV, and a fantastic bathroom with a separate bath and a huge rain shower. The bathroom has glass walls so you can watch CNN while you're in the shower (or on the loo!). I have to say the room was trully 5 star. There was also a nice big desk and a comfortable office chair, the same one that is pretty much standard for Intercontinental. One gripe, the internet connection was good, but very expensive. After tax it was 1250 rupees (about 25 euros) for 24 hours, which is ridiculous.I ate the buffet in the 24/7 cafe. The cafe/restaurant itself has been fully renovated and is very nice. The food was excellent, but typically expensive - about 2000 rupees for lunch or dinner per person. Service was excellent.The gym was a bit of a dissapointment - very small and no eliptical cross trainer. Hopefully that will also eventually be changed. Location is good, very central in Delhi.Overall, the hotel is definately going in the right direction. Its well on its way to a genuine Intercontinental standard. One note: Hotels in New Delhi are INSANELY over-priced. I paid 16000 rupees per night (including the luxury tax) which was the lowest rate I could find in any decent hotel in New Delhi. When you compare the room I had with rooms at the Park, or the Metropolitan, or even the Le Meridien, where the rooms were even more expensive, I rate this hotel as excellent value, all things considered."
97,1724,"Oct 23 2007	Good Hotel for India	Stayed 2 nights and 1 night on seperate visits to hotel in both new and old rooms. I thought the standard of both types of rooms were fairly good; particularly nice beds. The older rooms aren't as nice as the very modern new ones, but the older room I got was much larger. Renovation noise was noticable but I sleep pretty soundly; probably not a good idea to stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper till they finish. Service is good if you are persistent (like everything in India, things take time and patience). I got some decent food through room service. Breakfast is particularly good. Overall, I'd say it's a good hotel but I'm not too sure I'd pay the full retail price for it (which I didn't)."
98,1724,"Oct 20 2007	watch the phone calls	Watched the phone calls...They rip you stupid in this hotel.I got charged a 12.5% luxury tax on REVERSE charge international calls that NOONE answered at the other end.Paid $4000 rupee for a total of 5 min of calls.Breakfast buffet was pretty good and rooms are very nice, but the views are horrible."
99,1724,"Sep 29 2007	nice rooms 	This hotel is very old. There is some construction going on, so you might find it a little annoying. Restaurnants and bar are disappointing and pricy. I paid $198/night which I consider as a really good deal since hotels in Delhi tend to be very expensive. Service was excellent and my room was very well decorated and clean. They have DVD players in each room. I brought some DVDs and watched all of them! Internet access is expensive. I paid Rs.1,000/24hrs (about USD25.) Most nice hotels in the U.S. charge $9.99/day, so this is absolutely a lot. Location is ok. It's quite far to Connaught place to walk. But you can always take the subway(only one stop to Connaught place,) or taxi."
100,1724,"Aug 15 2007 	Grand Ripoff	Ideal location and earnest labor staff aside, the hotel is poorly managed, ridiculously expensive and oddly designed Poor management * Power outages are a norm* Electrical issues in rooms* Missed wakeup call* Uncoordinated reception staffRidiculously Expensive* laundry bill for 1 tshirt, 1 track suite, pair of socks and undershirt was Rs. 1900 = $50+. Criminal.* Internet per day is $30+ (Rs. 1000). Again outrageous.* Cheaper room are in construction areas -- avoid unless you like the smell of varnish and paint and the noise of a hammerOdd Design* trying to be post-modern without following basic design principles* oddest shower stall i have seen* no room to put away clothes* a/c that makes certain areas too cold and the rest of room not as coldEarnest Labor Staff* Not the well-dressed reception area staff who are mostly incompetent, but the poorly paid room service staff and the engineering labor staff.All in all, a hotel that pretends to be something that it isn't and probably doesn't know and doesn't care. For the money you have to pay, there are surely better deals in New Delhi."
101,1724,"Jul 30 2007 	Good business hotel in city center	This InterContinental property is managed and run by an Indian hotel group which owns &quot;The Grand&quot; brand in India. The hotel is very centrally located if you are on business at Delhi. The recently renovated rooms are great - especially those in the executive floor. A glass-walled bathroom, big-size plasma tv, good bedding, comfortable work desk and top-of-the-line amenities makes the room experience satisfying. The executive lounge is great with nice range of drinks and some finger foods. A good place to socialize and do quick business meetings. The breakfast is good - both on spread as well as on quality. The hotel is undergoing a renovation which can cause some minor disturbance (especially the noise) during your stay. I would recommend this hotel only for those who needs a hotel close to city center. If you are okay with any place in Delhi, you may find a better hotel at a much better price."
102,1724,"Jul 2 2007 	Charmless but the hotel is going through renovation	The hotel is currently being renovated: ask for one of they renovated bedroom which are very nice, preferably facing the pool (and not facing the train station as it can be very very noisy.)Rooms and restaurant are quite expensive and in my opinion is not worth it. It might be when the hotel will be fully renovated: currently there is no terasse to enjoy a drink in the evening or have your diner. The bar is pretty horrible (undergoound, loud western music, big screen tv, smoky). All in all it is charmless although my bedroom was nice. I was meant to stay 2 weeks, @ $180 a night. I stayed one week and moved to the Imperial for the same price (booked on the net) which is just FANTASTIC. If you want to spend this sort of money in a hotel, do not chose the Grand, or at least not before it is fully renovated."
103,1724,May 3 2007	Musty rooms and not very clean	This was not the most expensive place in Delhi and it showed. Our room was very musty and not very clean. Construction was in progress in some of the hotel. We found a much better place for much less money on the south side of Delhi at the end of our trip.
104,1724,Apr 20 2007	Floors that should have been closed in this hotel	We recently stayed in this hotel between 14th and 17th April. We were given rooms on 18th and 21st floors (2 occasions). Renovation was ongoing with considerable noise through the day starting at 8.00am to around 6.00pm.Because of the summer heat in Delhi we had to return to the hotel in the afternoons and there was no peace bacause of the noise. This was pointed out to the Customer Relations saffed by a very young inexperienced girl who had to refer to the Manager on duty. The Manager's response was that of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; that is your choice. I can understand his attitude as the rooms were booked through a local travel agent who had been pre-paid.The most polite personnel in the hotel were the lift and baggage attendants.
105,1724,"Apr 14 2007 	Nice 4 star hotel in a not so nice area.	I was going to India for a week and was terrified to read the reviews of the hotels in Delhi. They all said the hotels were expensive and below par. Well this hotel was very expensive but I have to say it was a solid 4 star hotel. Everything about it was great including the pool, bar, and restaurant. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel staff is that the doorman, who is a large turbine headed man, would give me dirty looks when I gave him a 20 rupee tip for getting me a cab. I though this as uncalled for since the I was told the daily wage in Delhi for a laborer is 80 rupees a day. The hotel restaurant was very expensive with dinner buffet costing about $40 US. But the food was outstanding with a wide variety of continental and Indian foods. So I ate there more than once and enjoyed it.The hall on my floor did smell of insecticide but on the positive note there were no insects. The hotel states that it is on Conneaut Circle which is the center of Delhi. Well it is not on the Circle but about a mile from it. And with the beggars, hawkers and traffic it is only walk able during the day if you have some courage. But it is not walkable at night. And the problem of getting one of the taxis is that I found them quite unreliable with them taking me constantly to their shops or just out of the way. And another point is that once you are in Conneaut Circle there is not much there aside from more beggars and hawkers. I found one decent coffee shop and no restaurants. So if you stay at the hotel dont think that you will be walking out and be in the center of a cosmopolitan Mecca."
106,1724,"Apr 12 2007 	Do not recommend as far from ""Value For Money""	I frequently come to Delhi for business purpose and I wanted to experience this hotel.With my wife we stayed 4 nights in the first half of April '07. Room attributed to us ,thank to my Priority Club Member card was quite comfortable and well located. In fact we were lucky not to be disturbed by the noise resulting from the rehabilitation work currently in progress. We heard around us many complaints about this. Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the rest of the services.Quality of food available in Self Service Restaurant is relatively poor and choice limited. Certainly overpriced compared to the hotels within the same range.Expresso coffee at 5 USD , of very mediocre quality is more expensive than the express in some Palaces in Europe.Internet available in the Standard Room at 10 USD/ hour is absolutely scandalous. In some Guest House in Delhi/Gurgaon ( B&amp; B at USD 50- 70 ), WIFI internet is available and free!Staff at reception is nice but relatively slow.This Hotel is not reflecting the reputation of ICH group and needs serious improvements.We do not recommend this hotel for the moment."
107,1724,"Mar 21 2007 	Noisy and beware the renovations	Checked in the afternoon after travelling for 27 hrs and got allocatted a smoking room which reeked of smoke. The room was shabby and needed a complete make-over. After complaining and requesting non-smoking room were offered a room &quot;newly renovated&quot; . Minimalist with a nice plasma screen. Nobody mentioned the fact that the floor's service area was still being renovated which was opposite our room.Needing some shut-eye the constant banging and knocking kept us awake. After calling reception and the duty manager around 7pm &quot;I will tell them to stop immediately&quot;. The banging continued for another 1.5hrs. Also the room was at the back of the hotel facing the railway station; so between the tooting of the trains throughout the night and the banging during the day we got very little sleep over the 3 nights we spent there. This impacted on the business meetings we had as we kept on dozing off!Being &quot;newly renovated&quot;, the bar fridge didn't work (fixed after five attempts by handymen) the hand basin didn't drain and there was a big gap in the ceiling above the shower rose. It seems that these details were not a problem with the front staff as nobody bothered to fix it-even after complaining. There were some big conferences on at the time so the hotel was quite full; explained the attitude of some of the front desk staff.The food at the breakfast buffet was OK but it was better to choose from the a la carte menu for dinner. Beware of the add on charges. We were quoted U$ 30 for 24 hrs of access to internet using wi-fi to which was added a service charge, government tax, as well as a luxury charge so ended up paying 35% more. Cheaper at the internet cafe near the hotel.If you do stay at the hotel ask for a renovated roon away from the railway station and certainly not where they are renovating."
108,1724,"Mar 13 2007 	Okay hotel but nothing special (maybe overpriced)	I was here for just one day, but I must say that the hotel needs some upgrading. The rooms were perfect, but the lobby/reception could use some upgrading. The staff at the reception is very slow and inefficient. The restaurant is nice. Swimming pool closes too early. Location is fine. Make sure you're minibar is filled with all the things that should be in there!!! Breakfast in business lounge is rather limited I think. For the rest it is ok, but probably a bit overprices (as all hotels in Delhi)."
109,1724,"Mar 9 2007 	OK Hotel	I was somewhat cautious when I stayed here after reading the reviews, but we had no problems at all. I was travelling with 2 other work colleagues and this hotel met our needs just fine. The room was very quiet (aside from the occasional train tooting), but I had specifically asked for a quiet room, and I liked the large plasma TV in my room. Actually a colleague on the higher floor (more expensive), only had a normal Tv! Location is near Connaught place which is relativly central. The Bathroom was a little dark, and the bath tub had a stain in it. But overall for the price etc, I was satisfied with his hotel, plus I only slept and ate breakfast here (of which I liked the freshly cookedwaffles a lot). But avoid breakfast rushhour on Sunday around 10am, too many people!"
110,1724,Feb 24 2007	Fine for me- but I was lucky	Having read the reviews I dreaded my stay.The room was clean enough- quiet enough-no problems...BUT- it seems I was lucky as other members of the party had had a noisy and miserable night.
111,1724,"Feb 10 2007 	Avoid bad experience	I was on a 2 week business trip to India and was looking forward to my stay here as all the other hotels I have stayed in here have been excellent. However, this place has some major problems. All sorts of issues that add up to an irritating and unsatisfactory experience. First, I booked a non smoking room. When I went to check in there were no non smoking rooms available and they told me that I could have a smoking room and change tomorrow. When I book something normally it's booked - right? I didn't expect to book something and find it was not really booked. I got the impression there was a big conference that had block booked some rooms, and my one person stay was not too important to them. The room they put me in is above an intersection of 3 streets and as anyone knows who has been to India, on the streets they honk their car horns constantly. This would not have been a problem if the windows closed properly in the room, but they seem to be screwed in place, with some of the screws coming loose, with the effect that some of the windows don't open or close properly and the effect is that the car horn noise comes into the room constantly. The room is OK but pretty shabby. The front control panel is missing from the television. The bathroom does not look particularly clean. Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect. I was under the impression that having put me in a smoking room I didn't want when I arrived, that someone was going to call me the day after I arrived, to let me know when I was switching rooms - nothing happened. It is the service here that is really lacking. I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in (the ITC Sheraton &amp; Towers in Chennai), but the service here is poor by the normally high Indian standards. They have this system where you dial &quot;9&quot; for any requests, this links you their &quot;Instant Help Center&quot;. This is a good idea in principle, but the people who answer the phone have such a very poor grasp of English that it can be an irritating experience. I called &quot;9&quot; to ask they why I had not been contacted about changing rooms. They answered the phone with the words &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained the situation, long pause on the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained again, long pause at the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;. You get the picture, you might as well talk to the cat. Instant, but not exactly help. I finally said, &quot;you can't understand anything I'm saying - can you?&quot;, they then said &quot;one moment sir&quot;, pause for 2 minutes of &quot;hold music&quot;. The receptionist was then out on the phone and gave me the impression that they had no intentions of contacting me about my room change, it was kind of up to me to remind them. Not impressive. I also asked them why it was 2pm and my room had not been cleaned. They said there must have been a &quot;DND&quot; notice on the room when the cleaner was there. Why do people in a customer care role use meaningless jargon when dealing with the public? I finally figured out that DND meant &quot;do not disturb&quot;. True - there was a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; notice on my room at 8am, but I'd kinda hoped that between 8am and 2pm a cleaner might have returned. The concierge service was a similarly disappointing experience. I went down there this morning and got some information about a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. The guy gave me some information and I said I'd think about it and come back later. About 4 hours later I went back to the concierge desk and it was unmanned. I waited, and waited and waited. Around 10 minutes went by, with receptionist staff at my side (sometimes not even serving customers) simply ignoring me. I finally got hold of one of the receptionists to try to see where the concierge was and they got hold of somebody. I thought this guy was also a concierge, but it turned out it was just someone they got hold of, he didn't have much of a clue how to help me, but said the concierge would call me by four. Four came and went and I called the ever useful &quot;9&quot; number and asked to be put through to the concierge, long pause again, the receptionist answered and stated that the concierge still was not around, but he would call me in 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later I gave upon getting a phone call and went down to the concierge desk and found him myself. The electricity here also seems to drop out for around 5 seconds, I was sitting in the bath last night and the lights went out. Each time the lights have gone out they have come back on again, but I fear they may not one time. Also a note for all us Americans and Western Europeans who are used to smoking being banned in enclosed public spaces. Word of warning - it is not here, and worse, there is little or no sign-posting to indicate where you can smoke and where you cant. I was having a coffee and a pastry in the coffee area just off reception (where the service was very unresponsive and slow) when I was engulfed in tobacco fumes. This is a pretty horrible experience when you are not used to it. I would not recommend this place, they seem complacent and don't seem to care about their customers. The ITC Sheraton's I have stayed in here have much cleaner rooms and their service standard are excellent."
112,1724,"Feb 6 2007	Grander than we thought	We stayed at the Intercontinental Grand New Delhi during January 07.On arrival we got a 5* greeting at the door. This was our first time in Delhi so we had no idea what to expect and having read previous reviews on this hotel was a little daunted that it was part of our package. We loved it. Yes there is building work going on so there is some noise at times. The rooms are being updated to reflect the trend in contemporary dcor. The views arent great but even if they were the smog is so thick you probably couldnt enjoy them anyway!We were on floor 18 with views of the railway station and the highway with its constant horn blowing. It was fun watching the local life and the horns are part of the experience, just like in New York but louder, longer and more frequent!In our deluxe room we had a super king bed. The sheets and duvet were wonderful, cool smooth cotton of very high quality. It was really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired so I think this room was awaiting redecoration but it was still clean with mountains of fresh fluffy clean towels. Strangely there was only one robe and one pair of slippers. There was all you could want - shampoo, body lotion, conditioner, soap, shoe shiner, comb, toothbrush kit, shave kit and vanity kit. There was a safe, hairdryer, iron and board, a well stocked reasonably priced mini bar and tea &amp; coffee making facilities. A great little perk was the complimentary provision of 2 litres of mineral water daily. The Delhi news was also delivered daily (printed in English).The food in the hotel was excellent we never had a bad meal any upset tummies.Champions bar was brilliant. A never ending range of international drinks were available and good food. Here superb entertainment was provided by a four piece live band covering some of the best oldies. The drummer does The Eagles &amp; Chris Rear brilliantly and a female singer who could sing Karen Carpenter and Sade. If you werent watching youd have swore they were the real thing - Awesome!Baluchis is the Indian Restaurant. We ate here for one lunch and one dinner during our 3 nights and found it faultless. The service and food was excellent. Tell them what you normally eat back home and theyll advise on what you might like to order.Rendevous is the international buffet. The choice here was enormous. Ranging from continental, Indian, Chinese &amp; Japanese. The desserts were to die for. Tiny slices and portions so you could have more than one at a time - great to try all the different flavours. Rendevous is also where the buffet breakfast was served; again loads of choice for all nationalities.We didnt eat at Art Juntion but it is at pool level on the 2nd floor serving snacks such as Nachos, club sandwich etc. Theres a great pool if you get time to use it.Also on Floor 2 is a jeweller. He was very happy to do a deal, very friendly and spoke brilliant English.Taxis and guides are always keen to take you to government shops. These are small malls where Indian handicrafts such as carpets, fabrics, scarves jewellery etc are sold. If you buy carpet, furniture etc the government will pay to send it back home for you. I then later read in rough guide that there are fake government shops and whoever takes you there gets commission on your sale so beware if this will bother you.All in all a satisfactory stay was had. The service was good, the rooms were more than comfortable with lots of amenities and the food excellent - what more could you want?"
113,1724,"Feb 6 2007	Good hotel	My 2-nite hotel stay was good. The staff was very helpful. Food was average. Room was average, but still clean and quiet. It was quite pricey, so I can't say the service or facilities were of equal value. Internet access was over $20US for 24 hours."
114,1724,"Jan 29 2007	Better than expected....	We were concerned about this hotel as a result of TripAdviser reviews but were given reassurances by our booking agent. It was pleasing to find that the hotel in our view provided acceptable, but not wonderful, accommodation in an excellent location for a few days in Delhi. Renovated, minimalist (and upgraded) room was fine with only occasional, minor day time intrusions from the hotel renovation programme. We found the entire reception staff to be most helpful with only one misunderstanding about billing. Room service, especially dealing with minor problems could have been faster and more reliable. Be wary of the inhouse travel service whose drivers like to take you on unexpected shopping expeditions! Excellent breakfast and a Chinese (!) restaurant to remember. Overall, an enjoyable experience in an only slightly faded venue."
115,1724,"Jan 21 2007 	delayed checkout	i was in this hotel last week ,and can truly say this was a terrible experience,however if you have time on your hands,and dont mind waiting 45 minutes to check out,my collegue waited 1.30 to checkout.this is the place to stay.there are much better hotels than this."
116,1724,"Jan 18 2007 	Disappointing service from a global brand	The Hotel Intercontinental The Grand in New Delhi in no way lived up to the expectations that we had of either the Intercontinental chain nor any hotel where the rooms cost more than US $300 per night.I was part of a large group staying at the above hotel and also spending considerable amounts on the use of the hotel's conference facilities. We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the accommodation and the level of service received when we raised our concerns.Several members of our group had to request to change rooms because the rooms we were allocated were unsatisfactory: they were dirty, smelled bad or were in generally poor or shabby condition. My own room smelled dreadful and the window did not fit in the frame, meaning a draught came through the gap and I could hear all the traffic noise. We had been offered newly renovated roomsa t the time fo booking, but we had to fight to get them.In general the response from staff was indifferent and not attentive to our concerns the first time they were expressed. I had to call three times to ask to change rooms and was passed to several members of staff and was cut off twice. Even then, I had to wait more than an hour for a resolution, which only came when I went to reception myself to complain. A colleague was offered the opportunity to finally change rooms - at midnight!I appreciate that we are priviledged to be able to stay in such an expensive hotel in a country where there is such abject poverty, but I do not feel that the service justified the price nor that the service relfected that which I would expect of the Intercontinental brand."
117,1724,"Jan 11 2007 	Loud hotel with unprofessional personnel!	Intercontinental Grand in New Delhi is a huge 25 stories hotel with no soul. They renovated a few rooms on the different floors, they look good, but all the other- old and smelly. Carpets smell so bad, you can't even imagine! And hotel located just next to railway station with trains departing every minute! And next to the main road. As you might know, Indian drivers horn all the time, traffic never stops in Delhi, so it is just inpossible to sleep without strong earplugs. We were in 3 different rooms until we found something quiet. Restaurant is ok, it is safe to eat there. Hotel has an army of personnel, they have a quard on every floor, tonns of concierges and receptionists, and they all want money!!! They grab your bags and then tell you that you should pay them. Unbelievable!"
118,1724,"Jan 4 2007 	Loved It!!	After reading all the reviews, I left London with a heavy heart. The last time I was in Delhi was 6 years ago and we stayed at this hotel and had a great time. But I have to say that the service we received was impeccable. We did stay in the Club rooms, which were pricey but we wanted comfort. The rooms were great. The breakfasts in the morning were superb, the pickups were a great service, and we were very happy. The location is wonderful, and we were able to get around very easily. I would definitely come here again, once we have saved up some money of course!!"
119,1724,"Dec 29 2006	Not recommended at all	The room was nicely decorated but the bathroom was extremely dusty and there was leftover grime in the sink that looked like it hadn't been wiped in ages. The shower drain and sink drain both clogged up, creating a mini flood in the bathroom. The worst part of our stay however was the awful front desk service They could barely speak English and as a result could not answer many of our basic questions. For example, they were supposed to call us with more information about our tour bus pick up time and place, but never called. When I called down to ask for this information, they kept insisting, &quot;No problem ma'am, we have the contact list so we will take care of it. &quot; I tried asking the same question 10 different ways but gave up after a while. As a result of their incompetence, several people were missing on our bus and our departure was delayed by quite a bit. We also placed a 1-800 call to the US that the hotel operator assured us would be free of charge, but the hotel charged us $70 for the call anyway. We tried speaking to management about this but they refused to drop the charge."
120,1724,"Dec 27 2006 	Very Average	I was pretty disappointed with this hotel for the money. When you pay over USD300 per night you expect better than dirty, noisy, dated rooms and bad food. The breakfast restaurant was terrible. The staff were fairly unhelpful (although the airport pick up was good) and USD10 per 30 minutes for internet access was not acceptable. It is nowhere near a 5 star hotel, I would have thought the Intercontinental group would have better standards than this. I was disappointed."
121,1724,"Nov 29 2006 	Expensive but shabby	We just got back from a stay here. Location was pretty good, but the hotel is way too expensive for what you get. We paid $380/night (including a +$40 2nd person fee). As other postings note, hotel is being rennovated and is noisy 24 hours a day. Rooms are drab as are the common areas in the hotel."
122,1724,"Nov 16 2006 	Worst hotel ever	Just stayed at this hotel for three nights and what a dump. A mausoleum - shabby, old, dated, staid, run-down. The check-in staff are useless - half an-hour to check me out and still errors on the bill. The rooms are old, dated and very dirty. The shower fell to pieces. Don't even think about the restaurant. The bar is dark and dingy and completely void of any atmosphere. The hotel has a pool which is used by pigeons and everthing/one gets pigeon excreta on them. Just don't stay here.................."
123,1724,"Oct 24 2006 	Stay somewhere else!	Stayed in this hotel while in India for two weeks on business, and it was not a pleasant experience. There are major renovations going on in the hotel, which means that you can expect to be kept awake by the hammering and drilling until well past 11 at night. Complaints to reception won't get you anywhere.Internet connection is available for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 24 hours. You cannot simply ask to be connected for the duration of your stay. Even when you get connected, it is often very slow, or occasionally drops the signal.Everything in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced - a buffet breakfast will set you back 650 rupees. And don't even consider wine with dinner, unless you fancy spending 2750 rupees on the cheapest bottle. (Wine that would be 20 euro max in another hotel - in another country - will set you back 60+ euro here.)The rooms were clean, but drab and dull. In the bathroom, the taps were water-stained, and rusting in places. And from my room at least there was no view to speak of.Hotel staff were generally very friendly - especially in the restaurants. And the food was pretty good.If you are looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights, then this hotel would be fine (but pricey), but any more than that and I would say stay somewhere else. And if you want value for money, you won't find it here."
124,1724,"Oct 7 2006 	Get another hotel	The hotel is under rebuilding and you will know it at your cost. Hammering, drilling, solvents, painting, etc., don't contribute to an enjoyable stay.I requested to change room because of noise, the next room I was glad that improved, except that next day they started to paint that floor, so it was not very &quot;inspiring&quot;.The same problem one year ago.For the price we can have better options in Delhi.Never again ..."
125,1724,"Sep 25 2006 	Very disappointing stay!	I have just spent a week in the Intercontinental Grand, New Delhi. A very tired and ugly looking hotel. The rooms haven't been refurbished for a long time. There was building work going on 24hours a day in a lift shaft near my room which kept me awake every night. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor has closed down, and on both nights when I went to the other restaurant on the top floor, I found I was the only person dining in there. The swimming pool has a net covering it to keep birds out except a dozen pigeons were trapped inside the netting flying around. The hotel is in a run down area of the city close to a highway and railway station with trains running through 24hours a day sounding their horns as they pass the station which is clearly audible from your room. Very annoying at 4am! Then on the last night, I was woken by maintenance at 00:30am to fix the lock on my door which I hadn't even reported broken!!! And to make matters worse, my airport taxi hadn't been booked and when the porters finally arranged one, the driver didn't know his way to the airport!!! All this, at a cost of over $1000 for 6nights! There are much better hotels in Delhi for cheaper, I wouldnt even bother considering this hotel!"
126,1724,Jun 24 2006	Nothing Special 	reallly really not worth the money. rooms are ugly/old/ and not clean. don't stay here. don't be fooled by the nice lobby.
127,1724,"Jun 21 2006	great hotel overall	We stayed here for 2 nights in mid-December - our first stop on a 2 week trip to India. I had stayed here twice before as a young, single female traveler, and felt very safe/comfortable. This time I was with my husband and it was an equally good experience. Our room was in excellent condition, and since we were recovering from jet lag we spent quite a lot of time there! Room service food was quite good, as was the breakfast buffet. We had arranged to have our train tickets sent to the hotel prior to our arrival in India and the hotel staff gave them to us as soon as we checked in. I do think that the Intercontinental, like most 4-5* hotels in Delhi, is somewhat overpriced, but it's worth it for a couple of nights particularly if you are just entering or about to exit the country."
128,1724,May 4 2006	Worst hotel I ever stayed in	I wish I could give it a zero instead of one point. This place is absolutely crap. I got billed 500 plus in two days of stay (including food). The room was nothing to write home about - the cushions had stains on them from overuse. The bathroom was absolute rubbish. The service was poor. The staff seemed pretty clueless most of the time. They couldn't arrange a taxi for me and kept me waiting for half an hour. And I had a horrible view of a train platform from my window. Nothing to write home about in terms of views. I will never never stay there again.
129,1724,"May 3 2006	Great place to stay	We stayed at this hotel in April for 3 night. We had a club room on the 23rd floor. We checked in on the 22nd floor which also has a large lounge where afternoon tea is served to guests as part of the room price. Dainty sandwiches and cakes with a selection of teas are available. Breakfast is sometimes served there as well.Our room was clean and well appointed with a king size bed wing chairs and large corner windows overlooking the city.Although not newly furnished it certainly was not old and tired. Believe me I have stayed a appalling hotels in England at much higher prices than this one with snotty indifferent staff. I found the staff well mannered attentive and ready to help in any way they could. On our last day there we stayed in our room till 3pm. Our plane did not leave till 1 am in the morning. The staff at the desk on the main floor had a whole list of suggestions on how we could spend our time until it was time for the Intercontinental limosine, which was included in the room price, took us to the airport.I read some of the reviews and I cannot relate them to our experience at this hotel. We had a great time there and would certainly stay there again when we go back to India."
130,1724,"Apr 29 2006	solid hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in April as a starting point for a 2 week jaunt through the north of India. I chose this hotel because we wanted something close to Connaught Place and we wanted a good chain. I was under the impression that being near C. P. would be convenient and we could walk there. But really, in retrospect, it's not necessary. You can stay in a hotel that is further away and really not miss any centrality because you can't walk anywhere! It is too dirty and overwhelming so you will wind up in a cab, which cost us $10 for 4 hours and the driver waited for us while went to eat, shop, etc. The hotel is beautiful and our room was great. They upgraded us to a junior suite and the view was stunning. However, all of Delhi smells due to the pollution and this extends into the hotel. I also think that the water they use to mop and in the fountains are really contaminated and smell horrible. But aestetically and service wise the hotel was great. Also, fyi, they charge you some ridiculous luxury tax in Delhi, this is typical of every hotel.We ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner 1 night and didn't find it to be anything to write home about. The bar food on the other hand was yummy! We had the chicken tikka massala and it was delicious. We ate in Zen in C.P. a chinese restaurant and it was excellent also. We went to a restaurant in G-K-I Market when we returned to Delhi, sorry don't remember the name but it's the only one there, and that was the best one.We thought that the hotel was beautiful. We wanted to use the pool but were absolutely exhausted and passed out on the 1st day after sightseeing. which, by the way, we got the cab driver for $25 for the whole day and he took us everywhere. So bargain with the driver when you get in. I hope this helps. I must say that the hotels in India were really expensive given that it is a developing country and how cheap everything else was! Also, we work for an airline and travel a lot just to give you an idea. We also stayed at the Taj Palace when we were returning so you can check out that write-up also."
131,1724,"Apr 17 2006	Decent Hotel not great value	New Delhi hotels are expensive and overpriced, that's standard. Lack of competition and a shortage of anything 3*/4* keeps the prices of 5* hotels at a premium. You either go 5* or take a risk with a 2*...which other reviews show can be a very &quot;hit or miss&quot; affair.Intercontinental Grand is in a good location very close to Connaught Place.I stayed in a club room which included breakfast and evening canapes, beer, tea and coffee all day etc.. If you get a good deal it's worth doing for a few dollars extra. Room was fine, bathroom a little tired with a few burn stains in the bath. Service was ok with housekeeping giving you extra complimentary waters for a few rupees tip. Swimming pool was quite good (smallish, but gets the afternoon sun). Only ate in the hotel on my last night before travelling onwards, got &quot;Delhi Belly&quot; after a meal at the hotel's specialist Indian restaurant (which annoyed me intensely).On the whole, a decent hotel but poor value compared to others you might have stayed at."
132,1724,"Mar 20 2006	The not so Grand	Despite it not being our first choice but due to late booking we stayed at the intercontinetal thinking that the Intercontinetal name would provide reliability.We had a club suite, the room was old and tired it needed a refirb about 2 years ago. Service at the hotel was very average nothing excpetional. The food also was also nothing to write home about."
133,1724,"Mar 18 2006	Grand is only so - so	I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand for 8 days during the beginning of March 06. The hotel was average in general, certainly not up to the standards of what you would expect from InterContinental. They were prompt in picking me up from the airport late at night (an extra $50 charge) and they were always helpful and quick with requests for extra towels, etc. The rooms were dissapointing and I expected more for The $229usd I paid per night. A 12% tax was also added to all room charges but this would have been added to any hotel in the Delhi area. While in Delhi I read several articles in the local paper regarding the severe shortage of hotel rooms in the city. This is probably why they can get away with charging so much and offering so little. The room itself was tired and dated. The fuse for the lights blew when the bedside lamps were turned on the same time the blow dryer (if you could call it that) was on. The carpet was dirty and the shower curtain showed signs of mold growing on it. On the plus side, they did have duvet covers on the bed and not just a sheet and blanket. They did offer wireless internet access although it was a bit pricy ($5 per 30 minutes). The breakfast buffet was good and had several western style dishes available. There was a great pastry shop in the lobby and they brought unlimited complementary bottled water to to the room. The travel desk (run by a different company) located on the second floor was terrible. We bought plane tickets and paid for them only to show up at the airport and learn that they had been canceled by the travel agency and the money refunded to them. There are two very good, although very pricy restraunts on the top floor. The location of the hotel was a plus if you need to be in the center of the downtown. Only a 5 minute walk from Connaught Place and the main downtown area. I was in town for a convention and talked with several people who were staying at other similar hotels in Delhi. The general conclusion is: expect to pay outrageous prices for any 5 star hotel in Delhi and expect to be dissapointed by what you get for the money."
134,1724,"Feb 6 2006 	Horrible Hotel	I put a group up in this hotel for a few nights this February and all participants hated it. First off, the concierges and check-in staff were rude and impatient, not to mention the fact that we were guaranteed better service if a male did transactions. The gender bias was appalling and embarrassing. Secondly, several people had plumbing or foul odour problems with their rooms, and although we paid for a higher grade of accomodations they simply refused to give them to us as they had overbooked. (Something I later found out, they are notorious for). For the cost of their rooms, they are simply not worth it. Period. Rooms are slightly run down with somewhat shabby bathrooms. They do have lots of shops, restaurant choices, and a beauty salon. Overall, the establishment is overwhelmingly large and comes with all the unfortunate problems usually associated with such a size. You will wait in long cues at the front desk, receive offhand customer service, and eat mediocre food. There really is nothing special about this hotel, so unless you are using its facilities for business, you are better off elsewhere."
135,1724,Jan 22 2006	The worst experience ever	We were to stay in the hotel for 8 nights but cut our stay to just one night because:1)There was no heat in the rooms when it was 40F outside.2)The bathrooms had rust on the fixtures.3) The breakfast buffet had some stale and undercooked4) The lobby was dark and lighting was horrible kinda depressing acutally5)people were out to trick you at the business center especially overcharing for the internet service.
136,1724,"Jan 8 2006 	Not what you would expect from an Intercontinental	Stayed here for 3 nights in May, 2005. The five stars must be because of the impressive lobby 'cause it sure ain't the rooms. After a grueling 24 hour journey in coach from California, checking in at 1 a.m. and only semiconscious and wanting nothing more than to put head to pillow, the clerk was extremely aggressive trying to get me to join the Intercontinental hotel club (or something like that) at some exorbitant membership price. Could have lived without that. As others have stated, the rooms were tired and in need of an overhaul. Windows dirty, bathroom mirror hazed over like you normally see in some 200 year old historic house. I like my hotel rooms on the cold side especially when it is the hottest time of the year in Delhi (110 degrees). Even though I cranked up the temperature as high as it would go, never got more than a cool breeze. It wasn't hot but not nearly as cool as I would have like it. When checking out the last morning of my stay, I requested to leave 1 medium sized bag and my computer with storage until I was due to fly out that night. They said they wouldn't store the computer due to previous guests complaints about damage. I asked them if they really expected me to haul my computer bag around all day while walking through Old Delhi. After a lengthy discussion, we finaly agreed on a compromise, that I would lock my computer in my luggage but this took 20 minutes of needless hassle. On the plus size, the guy who cleaned my room was very nice and provided extra bottles of water as requested (free) and the food and staff in the Woks restaurant was outstanding. Not sure why the place was empty both times I ate there when everything was so good and reasonably priced. The hotel is convenient to Connaught Place and both Old and New Delhi.I reserved way in advance on the Holiday Inn website and got a great rate a bit more than USD100 per night. For that rate, it was serviceable but for a rate of $200-300, you should be able to do much better."
137,1724,"Jan 3 2006	Good choice	Won't be the best 5 star that you ever stay in, but it is a good choice for a few days in Delhi. The staff were helpful and the service generally was pretty good. The rooms were a bit dark and could do with some freshening, but they were functional and comfortable. We stayed in a Club Room and found complimentary water, chocolates and cookies waiting for us on our arrival. Breakfast is good. One tip if the main breakfast area is busy, is to go to Woks restaurant on the first floor. Same breakfast, lots of eager waiters, absolutely no other guests ..."
138,1724,"Dec 19 2005	overrated hotel	Stayed here earlier this month. Hotel is centrally located and has spacious rooms with big beds and some excellent dining options. However, rooms look a bit tired and bathroom, carpet and linen are not very clean. At the time of check-out, the hotel clerk (unjustly) claimed that my travel agent hadn't made full payment for the room and forced me to sign an unspecified check. Since I had only half an hour to catch my train, I had no option. My travel agent has lodged a complaint with the hotel. All in all a bit disappointing for a hotel that charged me 240 dollar a night."
139,1724,"Nov 30 2005	good centrally located hotel	This hotel is a good 5* hotel centrally located in the heart of Delhi. While not the &quot;best&quot; 5* in the city, it is not the most expensive either. It has most things that a traveler looks for, including a variety of restaurants (though the service could be stepped up), small shops, business centre, large rooms and courteous staff. Would recommend as far as the big chains go."

2,1728,"life is simple	I like this hotel. Properly maintained, clean and neat. The rooms are big enough for a comfortable stay with your loved ones. Offer a good variety of food with a smile"
3,1728,"Nov 23 2009	Avoidable like all Park Properties	Like most Park Hotels, this one is full of noisy teenagers and over dressed local people.The hotel website is three times more expensive than any online agent would offer.I would suggest, avoid this so called brand."
4,1728,"Nov 18 2009 	just dont stay there	We arrived at Park Hotel at 18.00 on a Friday and we were just shocked. Since we are hoteliers, we asked for an upgrade and they provided us with the super luxurious room which had GLASS WALLS between the bathroom and the room. As you can imagine i could hear everything that was happenning in the bathroom....the bed linen were full of hair stuck on them...the bathroom was very dirty...a lot of hair on the floor and the bathtub...also there was no hand shower..so the water was only coming from the top..breakfast was ok...a lot of variety but still it looked a bit dirty again maybe because my mind was on the hair i found on the bed..the restaurant was fine too. In general this is not a 5 star hotel for me! I have a 3 star hotel in Greece and it s far better than this..just UNACCEPTABLE!!!"
5,1728,"Nov 10 2009 	Please find another place...	This is NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel - maybe, just barely, a good 3 star. The rooms are very small, the hotel looks well worn, the meals at the restaurants are much-much-much too expensive - as are the drinks at the bar (close to $20 for a shot of scotch - please!). On top of this the room rates are way over priced. I paid close to $230 for a room that should have gone for about half that. Beware, the photos on the web site look good, but do not tell the true story. In Italian we would call it a &quot;bella figura&quot; - in English it would be called putting a good face on ****. I also found the staff to be too pushy. On the good side - the rooms are clean, the upper floors are very quiet, and there is a good selection of breakfast foods."
6,1728,"Oct 30 2009 	Overpriced and overhyped	Though not quite as unbearably trendy as its siblings in Chennai and Bengaluru, this establishment is not the right place for a serious working traveller to stay - certainly not at the price charged. Go a bit further from the centre of Delhi and you can get much better value. The room was the smallest &quot;five star&quot; room I've ever encountered, and the bed far from being king size was an ordinary 4'6&quot; double. No fruit, no biscuits, no newspapers. Showering was an exciting experience as the water changed by itself from too hot to too cold with a 9 second cycle. Despite many people being in the dining room well before 7 a.m. (the breakfast start time) there was no effort to speed things up and the two waiting staff were already overwhelmed by the time 7 o'clock arrived. Just sliced bread available, no other breads or pastries. I suggested when I checked out that they respond to the clear needs of their customers for an earlier breakfast but it was brushed aside. If you have to stay there, get a room near the top of the building well away from the awful noise of 'music' from the disco late into the night. I will not be returning."
7,1728,"Oct 18 2009 	OK lot of scope for improvement	Having previously stayed at The Park in Kolkata I was eager to visit the Delhi version. Located right in the heart of the city The Park had nothing much to offer. I would rather call it a building with a bar, a bakery and a discotheque with some rooms.The rooms are ordinary, the staff and the front desk personnel behaved in a very snobbish way. For once I regretted coming here. The staff seemed more interested in entertaining the guests at the Bar and the discotheque rather than the room guests.The only thing like able was the Flury's bakery, their coffee and cakes were just yummy and made me forgot the other negative points. I would only recommend it to people who want to walk around in Connaught Place and central Delhi."
8,1728,"Oct 8 2009 	Please when can I go back ?	Delhi can be hectic and demanding. The choice of hotel is really important in this part of India , and I am glad to have found The Park. Its brilliant and I would definitely include this hotel on any of my return visits to India . The interior design is very groovy, but not cold. The service and smiles have not been painted over in the decorating effort. The restaurant at the hotel is pricey but briliant. The food is contemporary Indian with odd and unusual splashes from all regions with modern appreciations. Service spectacular. The pool side is really relaxing. Make sure you indulge daily in the breakfast on the ground floor."
9,1728,"Oct 4 2009 	Not worth it.	Stayed a week at this hotel. The experience was average at best. You know that something is wrong when your asked to wait in the lobby for breakfast. And then made to share a table with someone because &quot;we are busy.&quot;The place lacks the service of a top hotel, and clearly is a business thats more focused on quantity, rather than providing quality. Simply, dont bother staying here."
10,1728,"Sep 24 2009 	Very average experience- highly priced - low value	1. The car for airport transfer was dirty and very ordinary. The price charged for airport trasfer was around Rs 2000 incl tax one way..The driver's mobile kept ringing all the way from airport to hotel..2. I was the only person checking in..yet thefront desk staff kept insisting I sit down.,. whe you have a long flight you dont want to sit down , you just want to go ahead to your room..low sensitivity..3. The corridors of the hotel rooms were in very poor state - 3rd Floor ..had chipped off tops , lots of finger marks etc'4. The room as such was somewhat of a saving grace..though small yet well appointed...housekeeping in room was good5. The bar is overhyped and over priced6. The Indian food was great ..ordered room ervice and was delicious7. Breakfast was a mess next morning...toast service is vertually not there and there are large queues for toast..Overall very average...for the price paid...I will look another hotel next time"
11,1728,"Sep 6 2009 	only 3 star	We where dissappointed. The design is excellent but the hotel is already 10 years old.The carpets in rooms and corridors are old and overused. Windows where not clean, only one elevator working. In the restaurant you feel like in a students canteen not in a 5* hotel. Many groups. And at the end they tried to charge one night twice. Rather 3 - 4 * Receptionstaff to young and not experienced."
12,1728,"Aug 30 2009 	Terrible Very Rude Staff Poor Cleanliness Don't Waste Your Money	We were travelling with kids and an older parent. Throughout our stay we had several bad experiences, which you wouldn't expect to find with this kind of hotel. You do not get the service expected, for the kind of money you pay. 1) First there were flies on food at the buffet area every day, flying over all open food items. The staff at the buffet area was not very attentive. 2) We got human hair in food three times during our stay. 3) The water from the flush was black, which caused concern of falling sick, if the same water came from the shower, and if we swallowed it. 4) The rooms were unclean too. The rug was dirty and stained. 5) The phone would start ringing at early hours (5 am) and disturbed our sleep, this happened twice, among the 2 nights we were there. It turned out the phone quipment was faulty. This actually ruined our sight seeing visit next day.  6) My father found a scorpion like insect in his room; he had to call staff member to fumigate the room. 7) Above all, when we requested that our parent and kids sit in the reception/lounge area for an hour and half, after we had checked out, while we got some work done. We were refused outright and they were very rude. We could have ordered a drink or food and just left them there, but we were courteous in asking them first, yet we were not treated in kind. Considering their poor hospitality, we wondered if they would have just kicked them out?  We reported all of above issues to management, however no courtesy was shown and no actions were taken.In the past, we have been to many five start resorts like Taj, ITC Moghul, etc. At any decent hotel, if there was any inconvenience, the senior management would take care of it in a courteous way. We would never visit any Park hotel in the future.&lt;/textarea&gt;"
13,1728,"Aug 5 2009 	great experience and economical	very good facilities ,clean and in the heart of city having market at walking distance."
14,1728,Aug 2 2009 	Not a 5 star hotel - maybe a 2 star!	Bar outside played insanely loud music until 3 am which could be heard clearly throughout the room. Kept us awake all night. Thin walls - could hear people talking and even blowing their nose. Poor service - both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast selection - cold and lousy. Elevators broken and rooms really small. Would not stay there again! Awful experience.
15,1728,"Jul 6 2009 	Pleased with my stay....	Inspite of some bad reviews on the net, I took a chance and stayed at the park during my last trip to Delhi. Ive stayed at &quot;The park&quot; Calcutta on several occasions, where I found the room, service and food to be top notch - the prices were pretty spectacular too, I must add! The property in Delhi was pretty good and I guess if one is not familiar with the design &amp; service philospy of the park group - the rooms &amp; ambience might seem a tad strange. All the fittings in my room and bath were fine - i was really pleased that my room had atleast half a dozen plug points."
16,1728,"Jul 1 2009 	Ok	I can't say too much good about this place, but not too much bad either. Our room was small but fine. The loud streets of Delhi are right out our window and pigeons were sitting on the ledge the whole time. That would be fine except the feathers actually were under the window and behind our bed. Not too sanitary if you ask me. Dogs barked all night on the street, you are in the middle of the city, you know? The restaurant was good, the Fire restaurant was excellent. Room service was really good one night as I had a falafel and hummous wrap, yummy! It's got a cool feel to it, but that's about it. The breakfast was nothing special and the staff were blah... Sorry I don't have much better to say."
17,1728,Jun 27 2009 	Not worth the money	Dowdy room and bathroom.Very expensive restaurant.Pathetic staff uniforms.
18,1728,"Jun 21 2009 	mal-functioning and poor service	upgrade to club level without all privileges. We had to pay for our Sula wine served in champagne flutes. No snacks.room somehow &quot;cheaply&quot; furnished despite on club level. rain shower very inefficiently working especially getting rid of shampoo and conditioner took ages. The water tempertaure could not be ajusted: remaining only hand-warm. The aircon could not be adhusted: either Hot or FREEZING. The hair blower had powercuts and was of no use at all.The packed breakfast (incl. in the rate and a necessity due to early check-out) consisted or one sandwhich and an apple!The hotel as a whole impressed through unfriendliness, lack of service and malfunctioning features in the room.I particularly disliked the &quot;design&quot; features in the room which were not comfortable at all: 2 tiny tables attached to the couch instead of a decent table which made room service dinner unpleasant.The hotel seemed somehow CHEAP from A to Z."
19,1728,"Jun 18 2009 	Funky glitzy Indian Five star	One of the pretenders to being a great hotel in Delhi with an Indian twist.The decor is utterly modernistic (though not arty in my view) with the lobby full of glaring shades. However it just cant match the class of the Imperial or hotels like Intercontinetal at Barakhamba (Total business friendly), Claridges or even the Ashok (Excellent value for Money)The rooms are very small when compared to the large ones i have stayed at Intercon or Ashok.Everything else is quite good at part with any Five star though nothing home to write about. Would recommend this to anybody who has business at CP in delhi though Intercontinental is better in opinion.The &quot;Fire&quot; is a happening Nightspot and pool not heated. Gym is quite good and the staff polite and cultivated - a sea change from the ashok."
20,1728,"Jun 11 2009 	Love the disco-theque 	I was staying at The park at cannaught place many times. I find the hotel interrior is excellent &amp; good hospitality. They are having the very good break-fast, swimming pool &amp; pub. Try this. Restaurant is very expenssive. INR 2000 for one person minimum for good lunch or dinner. There are recption staff are not helping and asking 150 INR for one print which is unusual in India. Overall the stay was wonderfull."
21,1728,"Jun 10 2009 	Chic and stylish in a central location	I'm a fan of The Park chain of properties in india, and The Park New Delhi demonstrates why.The hotel itself features stylish rooms, great service and an excellent location. Wining and dining on the property attracts the famous and not-so-famous wannabees to the range of bars and restaurants, but for the travellers i have to say that the food is some of the best I have found in any hotel in Delhi.The Park New Delhi offers a very contemporary take on Indian hospitality - and one which I am always happy to accept when I am in the city."
22,1728,Jun 9 2009 	ananda spa himalayas stop over	it is meant to be a 5 star holiday but is more like 3-4 star more 3 star... rooms are clean and pretty basic - the tea making faicilities are in big round brown box where the kettle does not work properly - i expect it was designed by someone who is not very practical....i think it is hidious....reception very helpful and courteous but the same cannot be said about the after services elsewhere.... restaurant a real disappointment - plates/cutlery not clean and the presentation of the buffet/lunch/dinner not appetizing nor appealling....watch out for the rowdy music though i think this hotel should be marked out for teenagers and club goers who do not worry about cleaniless or other detail......
23,1728,"Jun 9 2009 	Functional but unfriendly	Excellent location, bang in Connaught place, jantar mantar, close to offices of Govt and financial establishments, good clean area of Delhi. The hotel is hygenic, quick but unfriendly. Guests are tolerated because you pay. 5 star facilities provided as entitlement not with a smile of hospitality. OK for a quick business trip."

26,1728,"Jun 2 2009 	Agi Pub Rocks at this Place!	Rooms are clean and comfortable. The location is excellent and you are centrally located but inspite of this hotel being in CP, there is no noise in the rooms. Best part of this place, specially if you are a party animal is the pub cum disc - The Agni. The place is live and kicking till 3 in the morning so for all party lovers and thirsty crows, this is the place.You can get good food till late hours"
27,1728,"May 13 2009 	Over rated	This hotel is very contemporary, but not classy. Things don't look luxurious, but rather a little on the cheap side. Room furnishings looked a little tired and worn.Lobby and bar are not large enough.Poolside is okay - nice for morning yoga before anyone gets up."
28,1728,May 12 2009 	The park again	very good hotel with beuatiful multi cuisine restaurant
29,1728,"May 6 2009 	Its a Ok hotel	Visited this hotel on a business visit and was the hotel was ok not that great. Cant have a business meetings inside hotel very loud eating area, rooms are too small its a much compact hotel and cant get clients here for a business deals. Ambiance is not that great but staff and service is very good. Overall for business dont select this hotel but at a low price if you have work outside and just want to come back and sleep in this hotel then its ok"
30,1728,"May 4 2009 	Loved the room	Hotel park at Delhi , its loacted at New delhi main city , Very close to cannought place and we had taken a Suit which was the most amazing room I had ever seen . I was in the 10th floor with perfect ambience and perfect climate at delhi. It was a magnificient room and the bathroom was very beautifully made. I have stayed their for 2 nights , Hotel also had beautiful restaurant at the top floor with a beautiful view . they have a pub downstairs , shopping is easy as market is close by . Good Food , Good service and everything was Perfect ."
31,1728,"Apr 23 2009 	Excellent Location	Very clean hotel in an excellent location. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. Hotels own restaurants are very good aswell. Service was what you would expect from a 5 star deluxe. Staff very pleasant &amp; courteous. There is a lot going on around the hotel as it is centrally located.Be wary of locals approaching you &amp; trying to be friendly, i.e &quot; I don't want anything, I'm just a student &amp; want to practice my english&quot;. They are just trying to con you into going to stores that pay them to get customers in.Airport is no more than 30 minutes away, so hotel is very central."
32,1728,"Apr 23 2009 	Better options Available	I Stayed at this property for only one night at their standard room.The check inn was a breeze and absoluetely no issues there.The hotel is in need of some major maintainence which u notice while walking towards the room .As u see walls chipping,paint faiding dirty carpet.e.t.cThe rooms though very modern,and upto date.As they were recently renovated(a couple of years back.) The rooms are very clean though a tad smaller in size.Afamily with even a small child will face problem.The bathrooms again were very clean and were of comfortable size.They have a small pool so those who like their pool workouts beter check.The biggest disappointment is their spa,atrociusly priced and not big enough at all.The gym is ok but they don't have any steam and jacuzzi,plus their sauna was a mouse hole.I tried one of their treatments and i was less then impressed.While checking out i kept on waiting for the bell boy for an hour to take my luggage to the reception for my settelemnt of bills,but despite calling twice he didn.t turn up.So with my small child in my lap i had to take my luggage down on my ownThe hotel entrance is very stylish and chic .But overal if u r looking for luxury and leasure there are much better properties available in very close proximity in same prices.Properties which are big and comfortable."
33,1728,Apr 21 2009 	central place	The hotel is located in the central business district of New Delhi and hence is very suitabel for busienss travellers. They have very good club rooms and the decor is exceptional.Food at the fire is really innovative and good.
34,1728,"Apr 18 2009 	Very accessible and luxurious hotel	The Park is situated in the heart of Delhi and thats the biggest plus for a business traveller... Its a nice luxurious hotel, nothing much to complain about, a typical nice 5 star hotel with a typically nice Indian hospitality."
35,1728,"Apr 17 2009 	Comfortable and prime location	The Hotel location is ideal, being in the CBD and just oppsite my office. The hotel tends to be noisy due to a constant influx of tourists at all times. The coffee shop has a good menu at all times. However, the staff is not very efficient. Best part of the coffee shop is the buffet. You have to plan to avoid peak times to get a seat. rooms are very comfortable and well laid out. Cleanliness and house keeping as well as other services are good. The front desk staff is good."
36,1728,"Mar 29 2009	Lovely place to recover from Delhi Belly	I have been surprised by the other comments because I found this hotel, clean, quiet and extremely comfortable - the best bed in India. As I had the room to myself I was not fazed by the bathroom. The service I experienced was superb - there was always someone on hand to help me and boy did I need it!The pool was lovely but unfortunately a little shady. I also had a wonderful facial. My only negative points are the cost of the internet which was certainly excessive and the cost of a bottle of water which I had thought was complimentary while sending emails."
37,1728,"Mar 23 2009 	Bad first impression	The Park attempts to fit itself into the W genre of hotels, albeit failing pretty miserably. I will try to make this really short:1. Night club music audible, at least in my room, until 4 am. Not good considering I had just gotten off a 20 hour flight and had an early call time.2. The lobby and front is infested with mosquitoes. 3. Understandably, even though I have long hair and am male, there is no need to be openly making fun of me for looking like a female [at least to the staff I might have], very unprofessional.4. Rooms are nicely decorated, but removing 23 ornamental pillows from my bed before finally being able to go to sleep is no fun.5. Room had a glass case with relic in it, even though it might seem cool at first, really, it doesn't say so much about the value placed on such important pieces of one's history.6. No wireless.It just wasn't that great, especially for the price. If you read my review of the Trident in Agra you will notice I mention breakfast at 5AM. The staff at the Park were only willing to sell us two day old pastries. So much for the complimentary breakfast.I'm sure there's better hotels to stay at in Delhi. Unless you like to party until 4 am and don't want to deal with trying to find your way home, stay here. All in one."
38,1728,"Mar 23 2009	Not sure about the bathrooms	The hotel is of 4 star standard but trying to be 5 star and not making it. The rooms are a good size but I didn't like the frosted glass walled bathrooms which weren'y very private. The rooms were clean and included TV, DVD, hair dryer, kettle. mini-bar etc. The lifts were rather slow and one of the 3 was out of action. The breakfast was good and there is space to sit outside. There's a pool but I didn't have time to use it. The bar is very expensive - 425 rupees (or 6/$10) for a small bottle of beer! I would consider staying here again but I wouldn't drink at the bar!"
39,1728,"Mar 19 2009 	Very nice Hotel.	Clean Hotel Room fine Bathroom...large bath would take a week to fill...Shower a little awkward to work.. but of no great consequence. Pool is outside we didnt use it as it was still quite cool for outdoor bathing. The Hotel is located at the end of an Avenue oposite a Conservatory (Small park) it is 2-3 minutes away from a busy shopping area. We only went down this street once found it a little overpowering and crowded also everyone wanted to either sell us something or &quot;Be our Guide&quot; (for a fee of course)The Restaurant in the Reception was quite casual and served all kinds of food. The buffet looked very nice indeed, we didnt sample it because it was our first visit to India and we were over cautious at first with regards to food. The Breakfast was very nice- self service. The food we were served in the Restauirant was hot and well cooked. The staff in the Restaurant and Reception were friendly and helpfull."
40,1728,"Mar 19 2009 	Noisy!	I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to the service I receive at a hotel, but had to share this terrible experience from my recent stay at The Park.My husband and I needed to be up by 7 am the morning after we checked into the hotel, so we called it an early night and headed to our room at 11 pm. We could hear music/beats inside the room, so I called the front desk and inquired about the noise. They said it was coming from their club, and wouldn't reach above the 3rd floor. They asked us if we'd like to move to a room on a higher floor. We thought was nice, and agreed to change rooms. When we got to our room on the higher floor, we found we were facing the pool area, where a party was going on. Now, not only could we hear beats, but the actual words to the techno songs...clearly. No pillow over my head would make them go away. So I called the front desk again, and again, and again. In all, I probably called half a dozen times. The front desk would say the party would be ending soon, the party would end at 1, the party was just ending, the party would end at 2, etc. I was always polite when I spoke with them, letting them know I didn't think it was their fault, and asking them if they could &quot;please just turn it down&quot;, or &quot;did [they] maybe have ear plugs I could try?&quot;. All I got was that there was nothing else they could do, and that the party would end in some time. By the last couple calls, the front desk staff sounded annoyed at having to speak with me, and I was on the verge of loosing my &quot;nice.&quot; So, my husband called the front desk at 2:30 in the morning, and asked them again to please do SOMETHING about the noise. They said a manager was taking care of it. At 2:45 the music FINALLY stopped. My husband and I got less than four hours sleep.No one asked how our stay was when we checked out. I remember because I was ready to let them know how disappointed I was. I did leave a comment card, though.Even by Indian standards, the hotel was not very clean. There were MANY stains on furniture/rugs, and the rooms were dusty. It felt more like a hostel than a hotel.The door to the bathroom is about 2 feet from the bed. It's a frosted, glass, sliding door that leaves a 2 inch gap between it and the bathroom wall, so there is not complete privacy. The lighting was also a bit difficult to figure out. I've never written an online complaint about a hotel stay before, but felt compelled to do so after this experience. I would never stay at The Park again."
41,1728,"Mar 15 2009	Never go on a Friday!	We spent 2 separate nights at this hotel at the start and finish of our 3 week tour in India. The first night wasn't too problematic although the hotels 'trendy' bathroom was totally impractical - a washbasin that was too high to use comfortably, hardly anywhere to put stuff and opaque glass walls and sliding door which ensured no privacy at all! The last night, however, was something else! I don't know if Friday is the only disco night but be warned even if you are on the 4rth floor, as we were, you will not sleep at all. Not only was the music at full blast but there were also people talking and smoking in the corridor outside our room for most of the night. At 3.30 a.m. I complained to the duty manager who was kindness itself and did tell the people to shut up! The disco ended at 4 a.m. so we got a couple of hours sleep then."
42,1728,"Mar 8 2009	Barely okay rooms and lobby	We spent 4 nights here upon arrival in New Delhi as travel service had chosen hotel for us. We had no problems with check-in or check out, fast and accurrate but a representative of the travel company got us registered and we were upgraded to the club floor. The area rug in the room needed to be cleaned, the whole place felt slightly dirty. But bed and towels were clean. The club floor offered nothing different, internet access was chargeable and so was coffee. We ate breakfast here and it was fine for a buffet which catered to all different nationalities. But service was slow and got fast only after we paid the bill as the waiters were looking for a tip (even if they were not our waiter they raced over to collect it). The maid service was very uneven, vrying from outstanding to poor - no replacement of bath towels without asking, no additional coffee. The decor is an attempt to be contemporary and &quot;hip&quot; but ends up garish and tacky. Lots of small tour groups stay here (especially French). Outside of the hotel gates there are so many hawkers that the first time we had to return as they would not even allow us to walk (they blocked our path). The location of being central made no difference to us as we were picked up at the hotel and driven to the 'sights&quot;."
43,1728,"Mar 8 2009	Comfortable but not wow	Obviously taking its inspiration from the W hotels right down to leaving apples and oranges in the room. It's not luxury but it's a good base to explore Delhi from. The rooms are comfortable and generally clean but not spectacular. If you're a sensitive sleeper, the noise from the nightclub may keep you awake."
44,1728,"Feb 25 2009	Stylish but expensive if work is not paying.	The Park was an unusual choice by our tour group which doesn't really want or expect posh hotels like this but it was a good start and end to the trip. The hotel is clearly upmarket, well designed and stylish in the entrance hall and bedrooms. The staff are very friendly and service was always with a smile although felt a little slow on reception.I can't say whether its good value but the hotel is certainly popular with the local wealthy kids and they seem to have a nightclub on Saturday nights so be warned not to get a room too close to the ground floor as it disturbed a number of people in our group. Given that a coffee cost us 3.50 when we arrived everything was very expensive compared to the rest of India generally and Rs400 for an hour of internet connection shows this is more a business hotel. Water and food is better found outside the hotel unless you have deep pockets or work is picking up the bill."
45,1728,"Feb 22 2009 	Noisy Hotel Expensive Restaurant	This hotel is in close proximity of Connaught Place where my husband had dung thrown on his shoes in an attempt to mug himThe hotel is clean, but there are stains on the carpet and a noisy disco. Although the restaurant has a good choice the prices are expensive"
46,1728,"Feb 10 2009 	dirty and overpriced; yes a friendly staff but not very professional	Two of us stayed here (two rooms, on business) in early February 2009 for six night. During the course of our stay, we also went to three other hotels in New Delhi for meetings. All three were better-- much,much better-than The Park, so much so that we asked for room rates while at each and found that these others (Imperial, Taj, and one other I'm forgetting--Claridges?) were in the same price range. I've never bothered writing a review before but this place cost so much, and the rooms were so filthy and rundown, that I had to warn others. I'm not sure if the other reviews here are from real people or from the hotel; they're just too positive. The staff was all pleasant and the area by the pool isn't unattractive,but the loud,obnoxious and constant music there made even a normal conversation almost impossible. I was certain the sockets in my room would explode, so I unplugged my laptop and other electrical devices everyday. The wait staff was in the hotel restaurant was friendly but there are so many working that they get in each other's way,sitting multiple parties at one table (without knowing they've done so). We will not return."
47,1728,"Jan 28 2009 	Nice rooms but noisy	We stayed at the Park for 2 nights. We arrived late on the Friday night and a hotel car picked us up from Indri Gandhi airport - a good call as it's a bit much when you step off the plane!! The hotel itself is nice and central. Security in high force. Room decent size and modern - although not especially clean (particularly the bathroom). The rooms are not sound proofed and the road outside is very busy - lots of beeping (as with everywhere in India!) and shouting - perhaps this was as it was Friday and Saturday night. There was also a lot of pigeons and no nails or anything on the outside window sill to stop loads of them landing and cooing constantly. The bar area is obviously party central for rich Indians - and probably fun if you can join in. But, we had a 5am start so we ate in Fire (very tasty - lovely pepper chocolate truffles with the bill) and headed to bed. When we checked out at 5am (after disturbances in the hallway throughout the night - despite being on the 7th floor) - the bar was just kicking out. Whilst it was nothing compared to London bars - it was still off putting for an expensive hotel and there was a number of drunk men hanging around - even the receptionist seemed embarrassed. On the plus side - the travel centre sorted out some changes in our itinerary and booked some train travel for us - they were very helpful."
48,1728,"Jan 9 2009 	Enjoyed the Park very comfortable	Our agent moved us here at the last minute so I did not have a chance to check it out on Trip Adviser ahead of time. I was very pleased. Security at the front door was in full force. The staff was ultra courteous, the room was small but spotless and the bed comfortable. Nice art on the walls and some sculpture, too. Fresh fruit was waiting for us. Service requests were fulfilled promptly. The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast buffet with many made-to-order items. There was variety from standard Indian fare to Chinese and western-style selections. This was our first trip to Delhi so I was a little anxious about the neighborhood but soon learned it was pretty normal for Delhi. We spotted several monkeys frolicking on the roof of a building behind the hotel that looked like a school. After walking around for a while and being bombarded with the Delhi stimuli, it was a relief to return to the peaceful hotel. The exercise room was well-equipped. It was too cold to use the pool but they were cleaning it anyway. Definitely would stay there again."
49,1728,"Dec 3 2008 	Wonderful birthday weekend	From the moment we stopped our vehicle, we were escourted to the front desk and immediately received attention. Due to it being our birthday weekend, we were upgraded and treated like a king and queen. The rooms were tastefully decorated. The bath tub, which an entire family could fit in, was the highlight. We enjoyed that thoroughly. The room was warm and comfortable and the bathrooms were tidy and clean. The room service was excellent and food was divine. Our birthday morning, was so special. All the staff wished us. At breakfast we were well taken care off, the waiters, always on the go. Even though it was our birthdays, my husband and I noticed that this is the overall treatment of all guests, which was excellent to behold. Nowhere did we see, such enthusiasm in being so helpful. We admired that about the staff at the hotel. We certainly left with wonderful memories and an unforgetable birthday."
50,1728,"Nov 14 2008 	Not worth the money!	Exterior is ugly but in good location. Interior is retro and rather nice, but in need of updating, due to wear and tear.We booked a 'luxury' room and paid a luxury price for it, however, the room was very small and although attractive, there was absolutely nothing luxury about it! The bathroom was also very small and the moldy grouting, dirty toiletries, lack of towels (and not at all fresh smelling) made me very resentful of the price I had paid.The worst part of our stay was the LOUD, THUMPING music that was playing until 6am on both of the nights we stayed at the hotel. Our travel agents omitted to inform us that the hotel has a very renowned bar/club that attracts all the young generation in Delhi. In fact it is so popular that the music does not end until 6am!!!!!! My husband called reception at 6.30am to ask what all the noise was about and he was told that they did not know what he referring to. As we were checking out at 4am the next day we saw for ourselves exactly what had caused the vibrations that had been coming through our pillows!! I was fuming!! As a small boutique hotel they are certainly not equipped to be hosting late night parties and then denying knowing any reason of where noise is coming from when grouchy guests call reception when they are woken up!The service generally was rubbish and we didn't even get a 'goodbye' from the receptionist when we were checking out. The only good thing about the hotel is the location, decent food and moderate decor. Other than that it is overpriced, rooms are too small, staff are rude and the loud music is really off putting when trying to get to sleep! I would NOT stay there again!"
51,1728,"Nov 6 2008 	Slick property great location	This hotel was under renovation then but parts of it were operational. Conran and partners have done a fabulous job in terms of revamping this property. As you enter you are greeted by blue and pink interiors which they all boutique.On the lobby level there is the MIST coffee shop which served wood fired pizzas. Also they have India restaurant called Fire which serves great food.Room we got was on 4th floor. Size of the room was small but it was comfortable. Decor was good but housekeeping was not upto the mark. If you are two people then the glass bathroom is not very nice.Overall, location is great and service above average. Not outstanding but decent enough experience."
52,1728,"Nov 5 2008 	Bad services rude staff	This is another expensive hotel in Delhi....The hotel itself is nice, good, well decorated rooms. But the service and staff is terrible. Got a wake up call at 4am that was not required (later I discover it was by mistake!). Despite telling the operator that I didn't require that wake up call, I got a reminder wake up call at 4:30 (unbelievable). Complained again and, to complete the mess, got someone coming to my room at 5:30 to offer a T-Shirt (from an ongoing convention). My original plan was to wake-up at 7:30 and leave for a working day! While checking-out, did complain to the staff, who was incredibly rude, asking me to wait for the manager...The manager came and, with that face and eyes looking for nowhere said &quot;I'm sorry&quot; and that was it. Maybe that was a very unlucky day for me but I'll never take a chance in this hotel again."
53,1728,"Oct 30 2008	Poor Management --- money stolen from room by staff	The most significant point in this review is that we feel we were robbed by the hotel staff --- literally robbed. When we went to breakfast the last morning we left things in our room, out of the safe (shame on us - we ALWAYS use the safe) because we were only going to be gone 45 minutes and we were re-charging our DVD and iPod. Luckily for us the person who cleaned our room only got into the purse and stole $170. When we left our room with the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on the door (from the previous evening - no one had knocked all night or morning) and the T.V. on so staff (or anyone else) would not come in or knock. Unfortunately our room was very close to the elevator and the person who cleans our room was right there as we left (the only person on that floor who saw us). He asked us if we had laundry to pick up. When we said no he asked when we were checking out. We told him we were checking out that afternoon. Upon coming back from b-fast we noticed that money was missing. I notified the front desk about our missing money and asked if their system could track entries into our room. When we came back to the hotel early afternoon they notified us that the room was entered once and it was by the person who cleans our room. He said he was checking for laundry (?) because our clean room sign was on the door (it was not). He then changed his story (they said it was a language thing) and said he was in there to clean the room ---- but NOTHING had been done. If something had been done it would then have been obvious to us that HE had been in our room. The management assured us that they would investigate and take care of this. Not a single thing was done and never --- not once --- did they even call our room or leave a message as to what was transpiring. I believe this is not an isolated incident and it supports some of the other complaints in T.A. about management here.We were here on a tour with Gate One. Pros: Food was good., location not bad, rooms were clean and modern.Cons: Obviously our stolen money and management's poor/non-existent follow-up, the elevators are VERY slow (one being out of service), the pool was unusable due to construction,"
54,1728,"Sep 27 2008	Interesting and different	Apart from the excessive wait to have our luggage delivered to our room - Tip - wrestle the porter and take it yourself - I can recommend.Centrally located and a short walk from Central Cottage Industries ( a must).Gin and Tonic in the bar is good, but at a price that would make you faint...Rooms very modern and lovely bathroom, although the glass enclosure would be rather offputting if you were suffering from Delhi Belly and wanted a bit of privacy from your room mate.Breakfast is not to be missed with a Dosa and Omlette chef and smoked salmon."
55,1728,"Sep 16 2008 	Good Location but poor Decor	We have just returned after staying at this hotel for 9 nights . We found the location to be excellent and staffs were helpful. Breakfast was also good.Beside the above there is nothing good to say about the hotel. Rooms are too small and there is no space for your suitcases. When we checked in, our rooms were not particularly clean and I don't think the sheets had been changed. The Towels had stains and the bath Robes looked dirty as well. We immediately complained and they changed our bed linen and towels. We also complained about the size of the room and if we can be moved to another rooms as we had 2 rooms with long stay. Our request was not honoured and we were advised that only rooms available are in their Residence category with high rates. It is a run down hotel with dirty carpets in the corridor. Food in the Restaurant is too expensive. One day we just had 3 portions of toasted sandwiches and 1 portion of French Fries which costed us around 35.00. Our room keys never worked and we had to swipe the card 10 - 15 times . We asked the the reception to reprogramme it and it still did not work. Housekeeping needs to improve as most days they forgot to replace towels.At the Mist restaurant it appeared that residence guest do not have priority as we were refused a table in the non smoking area as they were all booked . Staff at the front desk were aware of our dissatisfaction but nothing was done.In my view this is 4 star hotel and no where close to 5 star in terms of hotel dcor, room size and cleanliness . In the past I have stayed at Grand Intercontinental which a true 5 star Hotel. I would not return back to this hotel in future and will not recommend to any friends"
56,1728,"Sep 1 2008 	OLD and RUN DOWN. NEED A FULL MAKEOVER IMMEDIATELY!	This hotel is very run down. Everthing is old and run down.The lights and stuff is also old and run down and don't always workThe key has to be swiped several times in order to work.Food is too expensive and in fact for the condition that hotel is in, the hotel price is far to expensive and should not be regarded as a five star hotel. Staff is helpful and friendly but slow.Rather stay at the Le Meridien for the same price and get a better new mordern hotel."
57,1728,"Aug 31 2008 	Where are we	We stayed here on two accasions between tour on our India Holiday. I must say that from the outset l felt as if we were back in the 70's in Australia.It is indeed different, and somwehat corny. The hotel is fitted out as the 70's, which is OK but indeed different.The drinks and food were excellent, in fact at breakfast whilse we ate European the staff presented us with a dish of varied indian foods and explained it all to us. Greatly appreciated.On our second time to the hotel, we were treated like royalty. Tips do work. We were upgraded, andcould not have asked for better service.Location is good, just watch for the Monkeys.Next time l would prefer a more Indian Hotel, l think."
58,1728,"Jul 28 2008 	Bad Management	The amenities in the hotel some how above the average of most of the other hotels in Delhi. However it shows that its getting old and need a complete makeover.But the reason why I wouldn't stay in that hotel again is the Staff,Staff is very very uneducated (including the managers). Give them any chance they will try to fool you and try to make the life somewhat easier for themselves.And the most horrible thing is they don't have any limits when they are asking for the bill. Doesn't matter if you are resting by the pool or exercising at the gym, somebody will come and question you about what you are doing there..."
59,1728,"Jul 18 2008 	Convenient	We stayed at the Hotel in April - my husband was on business and I was on holiday. The Hotel is tired and needs a refit, we were both a bit disappointed when we arrived as it is classed as a five star Hotel and clearly it isn't.. Our room wasn't particularly clean and I don't think the sheets had been changed. The view from our room was just an awful derelict site. Our room keys never worked and I had to go back down to reception several times a day to get them reprogrammed. The food was good in the restaurant and the bar service attentive, but expensive!! The pool area was okay, but there was a real problem with flies, which made it unpleasant to sit out and the pool bar had a problem with cooling so all the drinks were warm. I had a spa treatment, which was excellent. The staff were very friendly, but desperate for tips, so make sure to take a good supply of lower denomination notes."
60,1728,"May 2 2008	Liked The Park	This is a nice hotel. It is in a very good location for walking into Connaught Circus, walking to the Bangla Sahib Temple and is directly opposite the Janta Mantar observatory. The food was good and the rooms clean and quite civilised."
61,1728,"May 1 2008 	Bad value for money	I stayed at the Park for business purposes. It is a modern hotel (futuristic meets retro) with beautiful rooms -- lots of glass and marble and nice amenities. However the fundamentals of this hotel are extremely week. There is a 24 hour dance bar on the main floor however no matter what floor you are on you hear the pounding beat -- I was on the 4th floor, a colleague was on the 7th floor, and we both heard it. It woke me up around 3 am and you can also hear people from outside. If you want to sleep this is not a good bet. Another poor feature is the lack of expertise of the hotel staff. The front desk is staffed by very young, beautiful locals but they are horribly inexperienced, verging on inept. For example, I was having problems with my room key and went down to complain I could not get into my room. The front desk staff gave me another electronic key, I went back up to find the same problem. I went down again and they asked me if I had the right room. I had to argue with them -- it was quite ridiculous especially at 10pm when you just want to get to your room and get ready for bed.The restaurant is quite nice and it is near some shopping areas so the location is good, but overall I felt this was very poor value for money (I think the room was around 350 USD per night). I would not recommend it."
62,1728,"Apr 21 2008 	Dirty poor service but pretty central	This hotel is according to many locals The posh and most Fashionable hotel of New Delhi so we decided to give it a try. We booked via their website and asked for a non smoking room, we got given a smoking room. We managed after an hour of negotiation to get the room we asked for in the first place (the receptionist said she was doing us a favor!).The room was tiny but manageable for a couple. The biggest turn off was how dusty and generally disgusting the room was. Not to mention the sheets that had blood stains on them! The frosted glass separating the bathroom from the main bedroom was covered with unidentified traces. The hotel is in general bad condition .The restaurants white walls are covered with food stains.. .Needless to say we only stayed one night and quickly checked out. I would have believed in Murphys Law if we have not met at breakfast another couple that was as disappointed as we were.To add on to our list of negative experience, our bill was not correct and we had to argue it out with the receptionistand we were not the only ones doing so it seemed that most of the clients checking out as we did, had something to complain about to the managerMy husband and I have been many times in India and we have gotten a pretty good idea of what to expect for which price range but this is by far the biggest disappointment. For the same price you might as well stay at the Claridge even if it is a bit out of town it is worth the 10min longer cab ride to the city center."
63,1728,"Apr 10 2008 	A 3-star trying to pass for a 5-star	I should have known better to stay at the international hotels but my travel agent told me that this is one of India's finest. It is not. The hotel lobby has a stench that is not pleasing and there were quite a few (about 10) Indian men just sitting in the couches in the lobby which gave me the creeps. I did not try the food, instead I dined at the Shangri La which was superb, but I can say that the spa at The Park is great. The price was pretty good but the therapists were superb.The room was okay, it was modern, very boutiquey style, a little small. Besides the room and the spa/gym, I would not have stayed here esp. since their prices are comparable to either the Le Meridian, Shangrila or Hotel Nikko."
64,1728,"Mar 26 2008 	A relaxing end to a hectic fortnight...	We stayed here for our last night in India, having travelled on the overnight train from Kathgodam. We arrived at the hotel at 6.30 a.m., and within fifteen minutes they had a room ready for us at no extra charge.The staff were friendly, and the rooms were clean.Yes, it wasn't cheap, but it was a relaxing last day in India. We found the taxis a few yards away from the hotel better value than the ones that were at the door, and we used these for our final journey to the airport."
65,1728,"Mar 23 2008 	Tacky and sub-standard - Not good enough to be a 5*	IT WAS TERRIBLE! I was at the hotel in April '07 for one night. Me and my mom we're actually staying at the Imperial for 6 nights, however on the 3rd day Im[perial was overbooked and so they transfered us to the Park for one night.At the proch of the hotel you have staff dressed in shabby uniforms (v-neck velvet type tops and trousers), once inside the unorganised front desk took ages to have a room for us and made us wait around even though we had a reservation. The lobby is small - is decorated to give a modern and contemparary feel but fails and ends up looking cheap!To the rooms - its COMPACT - i'd call it a capsule room. The bathroom was tiny reminded me of the little toilets you have in an airplane. The bathroom was actually a part of the room - frosted glass walls was only what separeted the two and there was no lock on the bathroom sliding door. IMPO - At one point someone was knocking on our door - we were a few seconds late in answering and this staff member thought he could just use his card to get access to our room. We complained about this - wanted to know who this staff member was and why was trying to get into our room - nothing helpful could be said by the manager. Being two women in the room, I found this very disturbing knowing that anyone could just try barging through the room. We did not feel safe at night.Few PROS: DVD player in the room, with free DVDs to watch available from the library in the hotel. Breakfast was good, even though we were hassled by a staff member on where to sit in the breakfast hall. In the end I was relieved to be out of their and back into the Imperial which felt like a different world!!And the fact that the Park cost Rs 12,000 and is rubbish compared to Rs 13,000 at the imperial its really worth spending that little bit extra."
66,1728,"Mar 22 2008	Park Hotel in Delhi close to the airport	We had an extra night in Delhi and were given the Park. It is a very nice, clean hotel. However, it did not have that much character and was overall a little cold atmosphere. The bathroom is huge, nice to have the TV in there. Too pricey for what you get, however,"
67,1728,"Mar 20 2008 	Nice Hotel Expensive	I liked this Hotel. The hotel is themed is earth, wind, fire, water and sky. This is done in a sophisticated way and makes a change from standard hotel chains. All the staff I met were very helpful and were eager to make sure my stay was good.My room was lvery clean, arge and spacious with a huge bath and a big LCD TV, DVD player, internet connection and IPOD dock. The best feature of my room had to be the wheat grass growing in trough across the width of my room.The food was also very good and I really like the bar.The only downside of this hotel is the price! Watch out for the luxury tax on top of the rate. I paid 16,000 INR a night with taxes on top."
68,1728,"Mar 9 2008 	Really comfortable stay	I feel many of the reviews here are unfairly harsh on this hotel. Whether that's down to inflated expectations of Delhi I don't know but we found this hotel to be clean, very comfortable and offered good service. OK, so it's not St. Martin's Lane hotel in London but you can't expect that because they don't charge the same kind of prices. All in all about the only mid-range place that we could manage to get availability in and I'm happy that we landed upon it.It's conveniently located for Connaught Place with a cab and auto rickshaw rank right outside the entrance, which is superb for visiting Old Delhi, the rest of the city and of course onward travel.Great points to note - we got upgraded to the top floor rooms, which have a private bar and dining area, with excellent happy hour from 6.30-8.30 at time of writing. The pool area was great and the fitness room and spa well equipped with the latest machines. Breakfast also included in that top floor area, which was a real bonus.Points to watch out for - we always check the bill like a pair of hawks wherever we go and noticed they had squeezed a couple of minibar items that we didn't have. Despite upgrading us, they had added more to the normal 'luxury tax' that you have to pay. Our point was that in effect we hadn't chosen to be upgraded so thought it was unfair that they should make us pay for that bit of the tax. They removed everything we questioned with little fuss. Secondly, on our experience and that of other guests we spoke to, there is minimal chance that you will get to check in before noon if you arrive on an early morning flight so either book yourself a rest room at the airport and arrive later or be happy to leave your cases with the porter and do some exploring until your room is ready. The hotel was happy to check us in and charge us a reduced rate for the previous evening but considering that we had only six hours to wait, we passed on the offer.Finally, although they looked good, we passed on the restaurants in the hotel and ate dinner at the Banana Leaf - basic but excellent veg South Indian restaurant in Connaught Place and stuffed our faces for under 500 rupees!"
69,1728,"Mar 1 2008 	A Crazy Place with Some Hope	The hotel is not worth the money. The staff was very good and very helpful and my room on the 10th floor was pretty awesome. Marble floors (no mats) in the bathroom with a large marble bathtub and flat screen TV. Pretty nice. But that was contrasted by dirty carpet in the hallways, a dingy front entry and dirty elevators. To use the pool you have to walk through the main restaurant... which is awkward when you are wearing swim shorts and no shoes.The spa and work out room are very good. So the rooms on the 10th floor and the spa are great but the value and cleanliness of the hotel are pretty lacking. Only stay here if there is nothing else available... which is what I did."
70,1728,"Feb 28 2008	Overpriced but likeable	Hotels in this category are, I'm told, geared toward the business traveler; hence the price tag. The price to value ratio has little meaning for the nonbusiness traveler. All hotels in this category are severely overpriced, and you'll have to look long and hard for a less expensive place that does not have some kind of unhappy or scary story attached. We stayed with a small tour group, so I don't know what we paid, but I'm sure it was a significant price break.That said, we liked the Park. We stayed three nights. At check in we asked for an upper floor room, got one on the 6th, and it was just fine. Yes, its a bit shabby and worn around the edges. The hallway floor creaked and bounced, and carpets were, well, amusing. The staff was friendly, eager, and helpful. I had no problems at the front desk as mentioned in other postings. It's supposed to be a &quot;designer&quot; hotel, and I guess it is. Pink, burgundy, and baby blue, hanging beads, cloud photo mural in the elevators. It's no &quot;W&quot;, but so what; a sense of humor is helpful.The location is ok, within walking distance to Connaught Circle, reputed to be a major commercial district. Well, I guess so, and it is the major/luxury hotel district, but keep in mind you're in New Delhi, not London or Paris, New York or LA. It's very noisy and crowded. Like everything in Dehli, it's shabby and worn-out. Anyway Delhi is very spread out, lots of different neighborhoods, so convenient placement has less meaning.The restaurant was pretty good. We had a few light meals, and they were tasty. We did not try the more expensive, fancier restaurant to the right of the front desk. Service was a bit slow, but not unusually so for India. The breakfast buffet was pretty darn good. Very extensive. Even more than passable dim-sum (with commercial sauces). Some of the western entries (cold cuts and cheese) were pretty strange. And what's with the baked beans anyway (all over India at breakfast). Eggs are very good and tasty. Try the little white rice flour cakes that you sprinkle with ghee and spice mix...yumbo. Bacon is fatty but good, and chicken breakfast sausage is a place you may not want to go (I did and lived).All in all, I'd stay there again if I could afford it. But, next time I'll search out smaller hotels and b and b's, an up-and-coming category."
71,1728,"Feb 28 2008 	Acceptable quality very expensive	The Park was the official hotel for a conference I attended. For some reason I expected to get great value for money in India, and indeed outside the hotels you do. But the Park is very over priced and I would not pay their rack rate if returning to Delhi.A friendly and polite driver met me from my flight and weaved through the amazing traffic system to the Park (took about 45 minutes)Check in was polite but very slowRoom was OK but not special given the price. The rooms pictured on the Internet seem better than the one I was allocated.The electronic door lock was annoyingly temperamental.Generally staff were very helpful.The food was the best feature of this hotel.The bar was pricey by local standards.At checkout an Indian guy pushed in front of me but despite my protests the receptionist served him first.Although I was happy to tip during my visit, the staff at the Park were certainly active in demanding their gratuities, given the high cost of staying there I found that unacceptable."
72,1728,"Feb 23 2008 	Not what you would expect	The Park hotel is situated pretty far from city center, at least if thats what you call it in New Delhi. Part of the rooms has a nice garden view, visitors of the other part can enjoy nothing but construction works all over around. Ive been to Delhi on a business trip with some important colleagues and had to choose a good place to stay in. Considering my experience I can say that The Park is definitely not a 5 stars hotel. On one hand it is supposed to be stylish, has all sort of bathroom compliments usual for the level requested, bathrobe and slippers (which I myself was afraid to put on), pretty big room and night service. On the other hand, what youll have in reality is dirty towels, shabby furniture, muddy carpet and very old bathtub. Since I had one evening left from business diners, I tried the local restaurant, which turned out to be a buffet. It was eatable, but not tasty. While leaving, one of my colleagues paid for the minibar. For the first time in my life I became a witness of staff checking your minibar in case you lied while leaving. The reception guy told me that one member of our group didnt pay for cola or something, I paid it myself. Later on it turned out to be that everything had already been paid, my colleague even showed me the bill with that cola mentioned. Be careful while checking out!All and all, this was a 3+ hotel. As I understood, its a common situation in New Delhi. There exist luxurious hotels, like Tadj Mahal hotel, for example. But the average price would be at about 600-700 dollars per night. You can use the Park hotel for the short business stay in Delhi, although you would definitely be disappointed considering 500 dollar per night youd paid."
73,1728,"Feb 3 2008 	Marginal Not worth the Money	This hotel was obviously very hip and clubby. Lots of youngparty people in the restaurant and in the club. It seemed tobe a popular spot for European tourists as well. The room wasclean and the accomodations were ok. I expected more for the ridiculous prices they charge. Due to a family illness wecould only stay one night although we had booked for 2. Whenwe arrived there was a man having a problem with settling something and he was talking to the manager. I thought he washaving a problem but later realized of the 4 times I was in the lobby, each time a guest had a problem with the hotel staff. I found the service in the restaurant ok by Indian standards, the food was good. Breakfast was the best part of the stay. Themost gracious employees were the bell hops. We had difficulty settling our bill early while checking out. It took a very long time(about 1 hour) to finally decide we were not going to get anywhere with this hotel staff (manager finally) and so we gave up. If you have to, this hotel is in a good location. Just expect to pay way too much, not get any value for your money and possibly have trouble getting a refund if you plans have to change."
74,1728,"Jan 25 2008	Think before you stay here	We stayed here for 3 nights.The customer service was appalling until we complained bitterly to the duty manager.We arrived at 10pm the first night, had to wait until 12.30am to access our room and the sheets were dirty and also the carpet.We ended up staying on the 2nd floor. Dont do it. It is right above the nightclub. You will not sleep at all until after 3am. We complained 3 times from midnight and they kept saying oh it wont last long and it does not happen often. At 2pm they offered us another room, we had to be up for a tour in 4 hours!We were moved up floors 2 days later and we thought we might as well join them in the nightclub and guess what!? We left at 3am, make sure you stay very high in this hotel.The breakfast and Fire restaurant were the good elements of this hotel."
75,1728,Jan 11 2008	Wierd and not designer	Its not the same to design your hotel in an inane way and put objects which have no relevance to hospitality in your environment and claim to be a &quot;designer&quot; hotel...hello its not funky just wierd!!!
76,1728,"Jan 4 2008 	Great location but a bit shabby around the edges	We loved the location of this hotel - really enjoyed exploring crowded Connaught Place (make a trip to Fab India), had a fun dinner at DV8 watching cricket with the locals - and it's close to most sites, but it's a bit shabby. The public spaces were a little dirty and the room had a hint of grubbiness to it. The linens have seen better days. I do want to mention that the housekeeping staff was very friendly and always asked if we needed anything when we greeted them in the halls. The rates at this hotel were similar to others in its category, so if you are considering a larger hotel like The Park I would recommend you choose another in this area."
77,1728,"Dec 24 2007	Rooms Vary	I stayed at the Park two nights as part of a tour. The rooms vary; my room on the fifth floor was quite nice but those in our group with rooms on the third floor went sleepless because of the noise and reverberation from the disco. The included buffet breakfasts were acceptable. If you dare to leave the hotel you will be surrounded by taxi drivers, rickshaw drivers, kids, vendors, etc. This is the worst city I have ever visited. (I didn't go to Kolkata). Delhi is a 24 hour traffic jam"
78,1728,"Dec 24 2007	The Park is a disappointment	I stayed there for four nights and was almost continuously disappointed by this hotel. Service turned out to be highly inconsistent. Housekeeping was poor: no complimentary bottled water was provided after my arrival, and I had to chase down the staff every day to get the complimentary bottles promised by the hotel. One day, three of the four towels in the room disappeared and were not replaced until I went after the staff. Toilet paper wasnt replaced either. The mini-bar was never re-stocked throughout my stay. The air-conditioning unit was unable to produce anything other than cold air, regardless of which settings were selected, a nuisance during chilly winter nights. It was also impossible to raise the blinds to let in some sunlight. The bath-room did look snazzy but had its own problems: there was no discernible means of ventilation, and the flimsiness of the shower curtain made it impossible to use the shower without flooding the entire room. The public areas were fairly cramped, especially the lobby. The breakfast buffet was adequate but unexciting; one morning the staff would not turn on the lights in a large part of the breakfast area for more than half an hour, leaving guests to eat in the dark. Admittedly, the unreliability of the staff had its benefits: on one occasion the waiter refused to let me sign for a coffee and piece of cake which as a result did not show up on my final bill. Even so, I would have gladly traded this freebie for greater consistency of service overall. The attached restaurant Fire is quite pleasant and the food is good, but the incessant self-glorification of the staff and their obsession with questionnaires are enough to spoil anyones dining experience. The airport pick-up was a major rip-off: the hotel charges the equivalent of USD 40 for a pick-up from Gandhi International, a multiple of what even the most ruthless taxi driver would dare to ask for. (It deserves notice that a genuinely classy classy place like The Imperial a block away offers free transfers from and to the airport.) All in all, I got the impression that The Park is keen to create a superficial impression of classiness that is not backed up by an effort to provide consistent service and marred by brazen rip-offs. It is hard to think of a reason to choose this place over others. If you are willing to spend several hundred dollars a night, it makes much more sense to pay a little extra and stay at a genuinely five-star hotel such as the the Oberoi or the Imperial. Otherwise, save some money by choosing a decent place without the feeble five-star pretensions of The Park. I would not stay there again."
79,1728,"Dec 17 2007 	One of the best hotel experiences I ever had	I stayed in a deluxe room for 3 nights. The hotel staff has been the friendliest I have ever seen in any hotel I stayed. The Breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner buffet are absolutely amazing. It is a very chique hotel with good looking, young employees, a stunning bar that is packed with young people during the weekend and a very nice pool (not too big though)I can only recommend this place and if you wanna go party in Delhi this is a perfect place to stay"
80,1728,"Nov 29 2007 	Dissapointing	The hotel was booked some time before our arrival at 2.30 after a long flight from London. The staff appeared to be more concerned with paperwork rather than helping us to our room.The hotel though was clean and had all the amenities you would expect from a designer hotel. You also got the feeling that Delhi's fashionistas visited this place for drinks and so on.Sadly, on our second night we discovered that the hotel has a night club on the ground floor, which would be fine had we not been jet-lagged. After long and heated discussions with reception we were moved from the second to the eighth floor, only to be woken up by an &quot;after party&quot; next door.It transpired that the hotel had no staff to deal with this and did not care enough to send people to sort out the matter.We left feeling quite disappointed and know that if we were to visit Delhi again we would not stay at The Park."
81,1728,"Nov 13 2007 	Good location but definitely overpriced	I stayed in The Park in Dehli for 4 nights in October 2007 on a holiday tour through India. The hotel is located near Connaught Place, which is great. However, the hotel is seriously overpriced and the service is just average for Indian standards. (i.e we booked a pick up from the airport and I received two confirmation e-mails. Of course there was no driver expecting us and neither was an apology offered at the hotel. The rooms are rather small and the bathrooms are meant to be &quot;designed&quot; unfortunately - the designer forgot a bit about functionality ......so they are rather wet rooms made of glass!. Food is also rather mainstream and the breakfast is terrible with very limited variety, unless you fancy a curry in the morning.Because the hotel is very central in Dehli, it is quite noisy too and the hotel certainly contributes with some loud music around the pool at night, too."
82,1728,Nov 4 2007 	Much better than expected	I had read some negative reviews of this hotel but my wife and I - and our two friends - were most impressed - and particularly by the excellent attitude of ALL the staff we met. Smiles and helpful suggestions were standard. We arrived at 1 a.m. but were checked into high quality rooms quickly and efficiently. The breakast room is very large and bright and one can also eat outside in the large garden. The range of breakfast foods is good and eggs/omelettes are cooked to order. The pool is great and the bar round the pool stays open till well into the evening. Drink prices are quite high - but this is the case in all the hotels in Delhi. The only negative in The Park is the noise from the disco if your room is near it. (The hotel is rated &quot;the most happening place in town&quot; we were told). Our room was immediately above the disco and I (but not my wife) found ear-plugs necessary on one of the four nights we stayed. I made a casual comment about the noise to one of the staff the next day and we were surprised that we were immediately offered a room change - but it wasn't worth the bother of re-packing!
83,1728,"Oct 20 2007 	Carry Your Own Bags	If you are looking for the following from a hotel then the Park in Delhi is for you:1) Noise all night, including weekdays2) Lifts not working3) RECEPTION who say they have called porters to pick up your bags, BUT DO NOT COME, so advise is build up your muscles before booking 4) RECEPTION constantly baggering yopu to enquire when you will leave, when the know you are there for one sleepless night anyway5) Poor breakfastSo if this what you desire in a hotel then the Park in Delhi is the one for you."
84,1728,"Oct 10 2007	Badly Managed ""Design Hotel""	My business partner &amp; I were in Delhi on a 3 day business trip and wanted somewhere that was central &amp; offered us all the details and luxury of a &quot;Design Hotel&quot;. Doing business in Delhi is tough ,with long days that can sometimes be rewarding but other days which just seem so frustrating that you want to jump on the next plane out of there.As with most Hotels in India it seems that the housekeeping is done by men. As a woman traveler we have noticed that there always seems to be an invasion of privacy at some point of your stay and at The Park there was a real feeling of staff over staying their welcome in your room, very pushy for tip's and filling in comment cards. Security staff would take your bags to your room instead of the porters and then promptly ask for a tip.Room service trays were not taken away and stayed outside our room for 2 days. Carpets in the rooms &amp; corridors where very dirty. Elevators had a mind of there own and you would spend 15 mins trying to get back to your room!There seemed to be a real lack of visable management &amp; when a rather large problem did occur it was handled very badly which left such a bad feeling that I would never want to return. Receptionist had a very unwelcoming approach and were not very efficient with follow up on details which again I think comes back to Management.The food was however very good. We had the buffet breakfast and room service which we found some of the best food in Delhi. Believe you me we have now tried a lot of the Hotels in Delhi and are still searching for the right one that we can feel comfortable to return to on our business trips to India."
85,1728,"Sep 19 2007 	Not that great	My husband and I stayed in this hotel after staying in the overpriced Qutab Residency. This hotel was $300US a night which is also over priced. All hotels in Delhi seem to be overpriced.The outside doesn't look like much, but the lobby is quite intersting with a velvet ladies washroom, beaded curtains, etc. The front desk staff are quite nice and speak good english. However, it does take awhile to check in for some reason.The pool is very nice.The rooms look just like they do on the website, complete with a plasma tv and frosted glass walled washrooms. The shower is really nice with a lot of pressure. The bed is extreemly comfortable and the room is clean and modern.The breakfast is really really good and I believe is included in the price. We had supper here and it was terrible. The restaurant was called &quot;aqua&quot; I believe.Everywhere in India is expensive to stay. One really bad thing is our last night in this hotel we heard the thumping from the night club all night long that is on one of the first few floors. I actually had to wear ear plugs to sleep. We had to leave the hotel at 4am for our flight and the music was still blasting at that time. We liked the hotel, but didn't like the price, but all hotels in Delhi are expensive and you don't get value for the dollar. However, at least it is clean. Just try to get as far from the nightclub as possible. It is also pretty discouraging to look out your window and see the poverty from your glamorous suite below."
86,1728,"Sep 16 2007 	Way overpriced	Hotel is waaaaaay overpriced for what you get. The Park Hotel was a minor step-up from a hostel. I will say that I think this is the case with many of the supposedly 'nice' hotels in Delhi. There are just very few (if any) mid-range hotels. I paid approx 250 USD, for a room that in the US would have cost less than 100 USD. For what I had come to expect in Asia, this place should have cost less than 50 USD.Decorations are simple and pretty, and the hotel looks clean and fresh, but the room is tiny, and the water quality is bad! Water did not seem clean, and after showering, I always had a satly residue film on my entire body. Towels were dingy, and floor was not sparkling clean.Again, this was not a bad place, but for what I paid, I wish I had just gone to the Taj. The hotel seems to be in a safe area. I am a female, and I was traveling alone. There are a lot ot men that loiter around the hotel, just not on the property per se. There was a bank/ATM next to the hotel, I was able to go there with minor harassment. I was also able to walk over to the mini-shopping center, again with some harassment, but not too much. Breakfast buffet was nice and flat screen tv had a nice picture, but too few channels. Hotel charges ridiculous fees to use their internet. At these prices, at least 1 free hour should be available to all hotel guests."
87,1728,"Sep 2 2007 	Beware - hotel tax SCAM	At checkout - all guests find out that there has been a 12.5% luxury tax applied to their bill which is standard in India. The SCAM is that The Park applies the 12.5% tax to the RACK RATE not the room rate that we were charged. Our nightly rate was $168, but the luxury tax applied was based on a $300 room rate. For two nights, this was more than $75. This tax situation is never mentioned when you book your room or when you check in, you find out when you check out. We also stayed at The Imperial Hotel in Delhi - and they are doing the same SCAM to their customers, but in their case we were charged 12.5% of a $450 rack rate (over $100 for two nites), when our room rate was $189. This proves that the RACK RATES are randomly assigned and have no basis in reality. The hotel staffs say that everyone who checks out has the same bad reaction. Who wouldn't? This is unacceptable from any hotel, especially on this level.We will be reporting this unacceptable situatiuon to New York Times, Conde Nast Traveler and Travel &amp; Leisure magazines."
88,1728,"Aug 25 2007	Funky	We began and ended our trip in India at The Park. So, we stayed in two separate rooms. Both rooms had a funky, 60's feel to them. There was fresh fruit provided in the rooms - we ate the oranges --- dry and inedible. But, since it was an unexpected bonus, I wasn't really disappointed. The bathroom &quot;walls&quot; were frosted glass. So, modest people might be somewhat uncomfortable &quot;doing their business.&quot; Also, the light from the bathroom can be seen through the walls disturbing other sleepers.The lobby is small and was frequently crowded with tour groups.The breakfast buffet was included with our room - it was large and designed to appealed to international tastes.The lobby bathrooms, as with many in India, have attendants that expect baksheesh.Dinner was very good. But, smoking in restaurants is still the norm in India - and non-smoking areas were not available. With closely spaced tables, smoking was disruptive to our evening meal.Drinks were also unchanged since the '60's. Manhattans and Rob Roys are available. Requests for more recent concoctions such as Cosmopolitans or Mojitos are greeted with blank faces. But the staff also expressed a desire to try new things and was more than willing to make something that they never had before."
89,1728,"Aug 22 2007 	Loved the restaurant pool and staff!	Park Hotel had a cool swimming pool area, which is lively on Sunday's. The rooms are contemporary, small but filled with all mod cons. The two restaurants are excellent - we went to Fire three times and were treated like royalty by the staff - the chef even came out with a complementary specially made desert for us on our last night. Staff go out of their way to help you have a great holiday."
90,1728,"Aug 18 2007 	Modern 	The Park is a very modern and trendy hotel. It does have a far eastern feel to it. the rooms are small, but comfortable. The staff attentive and very helpful. The only negative is the bathrooms which are v v small ,with a sliding door = with zero privacy. No bath tub pl note.The breakfast buffet was very good and its a good place to stay for a single corporate traveller.Definitely not for families ."
91,1728,"Aug 15 2007	Looks great in a magazine I'm sure! Average to stay at.	The Park Hotel in Delhi must look great in some magazine. It must have won some design awards for its hip and trendy interior.Which is reason enough for normal people to STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM THIS MESS. Now, obviously as a luxury hotel, this is better than staying in a van by the river. and, truth be told, the rooms are quite good (we had a luxury suite or whatever). And, it's not exactly the hotel's fault if nouveau riche indian cybertreneurs insist on advertising their coolness by making a habit of standing in the hallway and talking loudly on their mobile phones.however, some things are the hotel's fault. For one, the lobby is an unmitigated disaster. it's loud as hell. it's chaotic. when i asked to schedule a trip with the concierge, i was taken into a smoky and junky back-office. the front desk staff is overworked and lacks a good communication system - they needed many things repeated (our check-out date) several times. people are standing around with luggage everywhere - it's cramped. it's just a bloody mess. fair enough - the 'new' park was built inside the concrete carcarss of an older hotel. but, it should have been done with people, not design awards, in mind.the restaurants are overpriced. I was charged US $150 for a bottle of wine that would cost MAYBE $15 at a wine shop - though the service was indifferent at best. the food at the outdoor restaurant was hardly worth the price - $15 cold pizza. Other food (room service) was better. The pool is made for looking good in some magazine - not for actually swimming. Considering that our bill with food was over $2000 for 3 days, I'd say you can do much, much better. A good hotel at this price would have us enjoying all of its amenities comfortably. Instead, we found ourselves hiding in our room from the rest of the hotel.Next time i'm in Delhi, I will try a different hotel."
92,1728,"Jun 3 2007	Tricked by false website images...	The website shows a really cool modern hotel with neat restaurant and bar. The truth - It's a run down old hotel with a modern lobby. We ate in a converted banquet room that felt like &quot;The Shining&quot;. Our room was darker and dirtier than a 1906's Howard Johnson. After complaining relentlessly about the false advertising, the manager let us stay in the 1 and only room that was &quot;designed&quot; as the prototype and used on the website. Granted, that room was cool, but the whole experience was a joke."
93,1728,"Apr 9 2007	Very Modern and Chic!	Stayed here for 2 nights split across a tour of northern India.Overall the Park is very clean, the interior and theme throughout is modern chic. The rooms are on the small side but still very nice and well equipped, all that you would expect. This is not a 5 star hotel as claimed, but would definately give it a 4 star status.The staff were friendly and helpful, and I was upgraded to a superior room on my second visit.The hotel is also in a good location and very central, Connaught place is a few minutes walk away. The only minus is that the bar is very expensive!Overall a pleasant experience."
94,1728,"Apr 8 2007 	Chic but small	We just returned from two weeks travelling around India and were unsure where we would be staying our last night in Delhi...we were pleasently surprised to be at The Park...just steps away from the shopping of Connaught Place and the Government Emporiums...after an eight hour car journey down from the mountains we walked into a hip and bustling modern design lobby and were greated by young friendly desk staff...the room was also very modern and fun, even though we had one of the smaller rooms it was great...the only complaint, as other people have mentioned, was that the bathroom did not offer much privacy (and since we both had a touch of Delhi belly ....) Having spent the prior three nights in an old world Raj type hotel moving to the Park just highlighted the complex and beautiful spectrum that is India...with its maginifcent history and its current place as an emerging modern powerhouse...India seems to be all about extremes....since elections were going on and the shops were closed during the day and we had done our sightseeing on a previous stay in Delhi we had a chance to relax at the great pool with the giant disco ball and enjoy the outdoor space...definitely would stay here again!"
95,1728,"Mar 31 2007 	Quirky and fun but...	Stayed at Park for 4 nights at the beginning of March 07. On enteringthe hotel you are confronted by a bustling lobby that would look moreat home in an art gallery. Very modern, very chic. And this modernisttheme continues throughout all of the facilities on the ground floor.From the Fire restaurant (which I didn't eat at but is said to be very good) to the pool bar with its huge disco ball illuminating the goings on!The rooms are very pleasant and well equipped. Dark wooden floors, LCD TV, DVD player (library of discs apparently available on request). Strangely the bathroom wasn't up to the standard of the rest of the room and whilst OK, did look a bit out of place. The hotel location is great for exploring central Delhi but does suffer from being a bit noisy, as you would expect.I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and couldn't do enoughto make my business trip as pleasant as possible. Overall a very enjoyable stay."
96,1728,"Mar 28 2007 	Experience in Delhi Park - Awesome!!!!	Soma, Would like to thank your team for their exceptional support that we received at DelhiPark!!!We had a terrible / horrifying experience at DelhiAirportpost we missed our flight to Bangaloredue to late arrival of flight from Jaipur. Will explain the details when we meet next time. We were stranded at DelhiAirportat about 8:30pm without any flights being available or any hotel booking. I tried reaching you but your cell was not reachable. The only thing that came to my mind was HotelPark, although I dint have the Delhicoordinates. I called Park Kolkata and spoke to Rajeev (The Lobby Manager – on duty) and explained the situation we were in. He immediately contacted your Delhi Office and in 10 mins I got a call from Ritesh (Lobby Manager – on duty). He immediately heard me out and confirmed a room for two of us and also helped us with the transportation bit.Post the kind of terrifying experience we two went thru and the way The Park Team helped us out was very reassuring!! I thought I should keep you informed about such a customer focused team, they just made our day after all that we went thru. Rajeev and Ritesh: Thanks a ton for your support. You just made it for us!!!"
97,1728,"Mar 14 2007	Good Experience	Finding a hotel room for 25 people in Delhi is a challenge. We were very pleased with the Park, both in terms of the room, restaurant, location, and service. When a complication arose in our schedule, the hotel management went out of its way to accommodate our group. They even hosted a reception for the group to thank us for our patience in working through the scheduling issues."
98,1728,"Mar 14 2007 	Good base for a few days	Plus: good location, smart staff, more realistic price than the 5*s if booked via the usual web agencies,Trendy interiors (flat screen TV, LED bulbs). Nice pool area deck.Cons: Glass walled bathrooms not completely private. Rooms not particularly spacious."
99,1728,"Feb 25 2007 	Overpriced but comfortable and conveniently located	This is a very comfortable hotel, but like all Delhi hotels, seriously overpriced. This hotel would cost half the price in most other parts of the world. That said, the staff were very helpful and responded to all requests for service promptly. The location is good, with a park across the road allowing a peaceful walk and only 100 metres to Connaught Place."
100,1728,"Feb 5 2007	Deserves a positive mention	There is an obvious difficulty rating a property such as this when for the previous four weeks accomodation in Rajahstan has been generally of a much lesser standard. Having said that, it was overall a positive experience.The negatives - expensive food and beverage (but what's new?); generally overcrowded lobby; bathroom not adequately soundproofed from the bedroom (generally a problem with sliding doors); aggressive taxi drivers just off the forecourt (but likely beyond the control of the hotel).The positives - lots of staff who were uniformally efficient and courteous; good location; great beds; spotlessly clean; dinner by the pool; a spacious residents' lounge.We would go again."
101,1728,"Jan 31 2007 	Okay but Overpriced	We spent 3 nights here in two separate segments, and it is a pleasant, 4 star place, even though it prices itself as something much better. The odd-numbered rooms (on the side facing the street)were much better designed than the others because the bathroom door does not open drectly onto the WC. Breakfast was okay if you were willing to wait ages to get a cup of tea or coffee: self-help was discouraged but was often the only option available if you had less than an hour free!"
102,1728,Jan 3 2007	It grows on you	We stayed at the Park on the first and last nights of a group tour.First impressions of the hotel were not good with a brash foyer absolutely packed with tourists arriving and leaving-chaotic.However the room was super modern and spotless with space-age facilities.The english buffet breakfast on the last day was superb and very welcome after 14 days of curry.Would recommend highly but re-organise the reception.
103,1728,"Dec 20 2006 	They charge a lot for what you get	You cannot criticize the hotel for the rooms. Although they are a tad on the small size the overall impression is very good. The hotel location is really good, within easy walking distance of the Tourist Offices and all the fancy shops in Connaught Circle. We also walked from here down to India Gate and the Parliament buildings without any difficulty or hassle. The problem with the Park is that they just charge too much money for what they offer. This is a good hotel, but not a 5 star hotel and they want a lot of money. The breakfasts are very good but you will find the bar prices to be absurd. The latter is quite common all through northern India by the way. 250-300 rupees is common for a beer whereas in Goa the price is 45-50. Funny thing, Goa is crawling with tourists but you will be surprised at how few tourists you see in the Golden Triangle. Anway we found that the Park liquor prices were higher than the Imperial which is very definitely a 5 or 6 star hotel, go figure.Don't fail to go for dinner at the United Coffee Shop which is quite close. Best food in India and very cheap. The Imperial has an incredible restaurant but prices are way up there.The heavy set tuk tuk driver who will press you a little bit as you leave the hotel is actually very good and quite helpful. 50 rupees goes a long way with these guys in Delhi. Beware the touts lurking around Connaught place. Virtually everthing they tell you will turn out to be a lie."
104,1728,"Nov 26 2006	Really liked the Park Hotel	We stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of a tour of Rajasthan. Contrary to reviews that I have seen, we found it to be excellent in most respects, the only exception being that in the evening we heard some drilling and banging from the floor above us - presumably where rooms are being rebuilt. We found the ambience, including ultra modern furnishings, pleasant and relaxing. The room was more than large enough, with the largest bed that I have ever seen - over 3 metres wide ! The staff were anxious to please and invariably smiling and pleasant - if there have been service problems in the past then the management must be working hard to address this.We did not eat dinner here but found the breakfast fresh and comprehensive.I would definitely recommend this hotel."
105,1728,"Sep 8 2006 	Better than the reviews suggest	I have to say that I am quite shocked at all the negative reviews of The Park Hotel, it is in my opinion a great place to stay. Its possible that some of these reviewers are expecting the Shangrila or the Imperial, but I doubt if they will find a room at the same rate in one of those hotels. The Park is quite different to the standard Indian 5 star hotel. They have completely renovated the hotel to a very modern, but kinda funky style which is IMHO very refreshing. I'm not an expert on interior design, but its kinda like what a science fiction writer of the early 1970s would envision a hotel in the year 2006 would look like. If you've ever seen &quot;Sleeper&quot;, or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; you'll understand what I mean. RoomsThe rooms are admittedly a little small compares with other hotels in Delhi, but in all honesty, it really doesn't bother me, although I do understand why it might bother some. If you are looking for big rooms, this is not your hotel.The rooms are comfortable, although they are lacking perhaps a nice comfortable armchair, but thats probably due to the space factor. There are plenty of pillows on the bed which is perfect for me - saves me having to constantly ask housekeeping for more.There is a wide screen LCD TV in every room which is a nice touch, and there's also a DVD player, so bring some movies with you from home. I undertand there are films available from the hotel, but I didn't try.The bathroom is a very nice design, though as mentioned in previous posts the door is opaque which might bother some. Restaurants and BarsThere are 2 restaurants and 2 bars - Fire is an excellent Indian restaurant and Agni is a very hip bar. Mist is the standard hotel 24 hour restaurant (though very funky) and Aqua is an outdoor poolside bar. Breakfast is in Mist and is typical hotel buffet breakfast and very adequate.LocationCan't get much better for location - its right in the center of town, 5 minutes from Connaught Place. Its not set in acres of parkland like some other Delhi hotels, but those hotels aren't walking distance from shopping, restaurants etc like the Park is.ServiceThis is where I REALLY disagree with the other reviews. I find the service at the Park to be as good, if not better than other Delhi hotels. for example: I got a phone call at 8pm one night from the hotel sales manager who invited me downstairs to the bar for complimentary cocktails. He met me in the bar and introduced himself, and explained that he likes to meet with the hotel's guests. He was an extremely pleasant fellow, and was very open about the high cost of rooms in Delhi at the moment, and offered some advice on how to get better rates - not just at the Park . He also arranged a 6pm late checkout at no extra charge for me. Its treatment like this that will gain my repeat business, and that is what I call good service. Beyond that, all hotel staff is in my opinion extremely courteous and friendly. All in all, The Park is not super luxury, but it is still a very good hotel, especially if you appreciate things a little bit different to the ordinary.One thing to take into consideration - The Luxury Tax that is levied on all hotel rooms in Delhi is charged at the rack rate, not at the discount rate. This is a goverment regulation and has nothing to do with the hotel."
106,1728,"Sep 5 2006 	A mediocre hotel with terrible staff and service	We booked for two nights on the hotel website. However, due to unforseen delays in India, we had to shorten our stay to one night. When we called the hotel to change our reservation, the manager on duty was arrogant and flatly told us that we could not change our reservation and we would have to pay for both nights. Inspite of being charged for two nights, when we checked in a day later than our scheduled reservation at 3pm, our room was not ready and we had to go for lunch to wait for our room. When we did finally made it to our room, a massive renovation of the corner floor was underway. The grinding noise and hammering was simply unbearable. When we called the duty manager to complain, she wanted us to understand that as the hotel was full, they had no choice but to give us the room next to the ongoing internal renovation. She appeared miffed that we could not appreciate her dilemma and assured us that the work would stop by 7pm and only start again the next morning at 9am. We had to call again to complain that the work was still going on past 7pm. The rooms albeit stylish and tastefully furnished with designer furniture and pastel color bathroom, were very small and designed with little regard for space maximisation. The food in the restaurant was mediocre for the prices. The staff at reception was disoriented and unfriendly. For all our trouble, no one cared and inquired as to how our had been. I would not stay at this place again."
107,1728,"Aug 29 2006 	Overpriced by at least 50%	Overpriced 4 start property pretending to be a 5 starWhat strikes you the moment you enter THE PARK, NEW DELHI 's lobby is that the website fooled you into believing what it said! This place is definitely not 5 star. It qualifies for a good 4 star status. But for sure, not 5 star !The lobby is small, but clean and modern art-deco types (not my type for sure). The staff I found was prompt, and the lady who escorted my family to the room took pains to be courteous and pleasant. Good. The porter who brought the luggage to the room looked menacing, don't know why!The walls in the pathway (isle) of my floor were having stain marks which I first mistook as marble design!The room I paid for was deluxe premium, and it turned out to be quite small. They could have definitely made it much bigger than this, at least considering what I shelled out for it.The furnishings in the room are good, but you really can't enjoy it as the size gets to you. The semi-transparent (translucent)bathroom walls are a radical idea, and may not gel well with families.The food is way overpriced. I guess prices could be slashed by 50% to make it feel reasonable. We were not happy with what we got, and felt uneasy.Another important points : remember to ask if the hotel is undergoing renovation ? The lady who escorted us to the room when we checked in gave me 2 bad news --- Gym etc. are all under renovation, and there is repair going on through the day (so be ready for some noise). Why don't they mention it on their website? I may not have booked in this place had I known that the Gym will be closed!Overall, a plush 4 star property, way overpriced. At leat from an Indian point of view."
108,1728,"Jul 10 2006 	A very disappointing stay	It was a very very terrible stay for me and my colleagues. There was absolutely nobody at the reception counter to guide us. We have been given wrong rooms. The staff was not at all friendly and some of them really misbehaved with us. Being a female, I was often taken for granted and even few staff tried to sexually abuse me. Over all avery bad experience. I will never return to this hotel anymore nor would recommend anybody to stay at The Park New Delhi."
109,1728,"Jun 15 2006	Overrated - don't be fooled by the website	I booked The Park on the basis of some positive guidebook mentions and the cool, contemporary rooms featured on the website. On arrival we were shown a boring outdated room in drab brown &amp; when I complained was told that only 2 floors have the updated rooms. I was then shown a contemporary room, it was tiny and the soft furnishings were stained. After protesting again that nothing I had seen so far was worth the rate I had paid I was finally transferred to a suite. This was glitzy (leopard print rug and gold headboard!) and v. large but not what I had originally hoped for.The staff were courteous and did go out of their way to accommodate us. On the upside the public areas of the hotel were elegant, it has a lovely pool area and bar and the location of the hotel is good."
110,1728,"Jun 4 2006	Bad Service Bad Food Just Avoid It	I has just been staying at the Oberoi New Delhi and my family and I went to Mumbai and then back to New Delhi and styaed at the park. I walked in and though wow this is a interisting hotel, concept design inscents burning lovely. But then i went to our bedroom it was tidgey!, plus the porters took about 2hrs 30mins to get our luggage to our rooms, the food is rubbish, the service is extremly poor, the lifts don't work and the pool isn't even vaguely warm. Overall a very poor hotel which shoudl't claim itself five-star."
111,1728,May 23 2006	check the bedding	stayed here at beginning and end of tour of india.loved the food and the service in the restaurants was excellent. BUT on both occasions I checked the bedding prior to going to bed and found the sheets were soiled. The second time the soiling was of a masculine nature. I think you get the picture. Ladies be careful.
112,1728,May 6 2006	I totally agree with Neil form London	I totally agree with Neil from London concerning the service at The Park in New Delhi. I think he gives a perfect description of what it is like.
113,1728,"May 2 2006	Disappointing!!	The only positive aspect about this hotel is the location. It is a short stroll to connaught place but the place is surrounded by unscrupulous taxi drivers and touts (people who get a commission for bringing you to overpriced tourist shops) who make walking a bit of a nightmare. The room was clean and comfortable but very overpriced. The glass shower is ok for couples but can be a problem when used by a family. The serice is terrible most advertised services are unavailable. The travel desk is a joke, do not use them as they charge almost Rs3000 for a full day city tour when the going rate is around R700 in an ac car. I will definitely not be ripped off by staying in this place again."
114,1728,"Apr 21 2006	Great hotel!	This hotel is a haven in the madness that is Delhi! We spent 3 nights here and really enjoyed ourselves!The rooms are immaculately clean with lovely decoration, the bathrooms are modern and well fitted, with lots of freebies and a great power shower.The pool area is small but well kept and well designed - but be warned, the pool is VERY cold! There are 2 restaurants and a poolside snack bar - we tried all of them and were not disappointed. The food is of good quality, as isnt badly priced considering this is an expensive hotel. Obviously it is cheaper to eat outside the hotel - but definitley give the 'Fire' restaurant a go. Has a great bar too.The staff were lovely to us, nothing was too much trouble and we were always met with smiles!I'd say this was the nicest place we stayed in India - we were there for several weeks all around the northern region and goa."
115,1728,"Apr 20 2006	A little diasppointing	On first impressions, I was a little disppointed since the lobby looked more like a glorified 3-star hotel rather than a 5-star hotel. However the room and bathroom were clean.On returning to the Park after an overnight stay in Agra, we had to change rooms twice on checking-in. This was not due to any fault on our part. The reason for this was that despite specifically requesting a non-smoking room both at the time of booking and at check-in we were given a smoking room. Although the room was changed we had to change the second time due to another problem with the room.Unfortunately for us this delayed us and we missed our engagement for the evening which we missed out completely since we were leaving Delhi the next morning. This was a little stressful for me.I have stayed in quite a few 5 star hotels around the world and I appreciate that mistakes do get made. However I was a little taken aback that there was no gesture made by management to acknowledge their mistake for example at least with a complementary basket of fruit.While the staff at the Park are very pleasant and helpful, I don't think I will be rushing back to the Park on my next visit to Delhi."
116,1728,"Apr 11 2006	Surreal experience	Quite a surreal hotel due to its ultra modern sterile interior. Great service, lovely pool, good food. However I couldn't help feeling that I could have been anywhere in the world due to the bland interiors. I suppose it is great is you want to escape the chaos of india outside its walls. Denim clad waiters, glass bathroom walls, Terance Conran interiors. If you like the above ambience then this is a great hotel."
117,1728,"Mar 25 2006	Plenty of promise but poor service and staff attitude disappoints...	This hotel really has so much promise - but I'm afraid I'm unable to write a positive review due to the poor attitude of the staff and resulting low levels of service. From the moment we checked in, the service was very average - rather than greeting customers with a smile, it seemed to me that everything was a bit of an effort for them. The staff at reception did not genuinely want to help - for example, when I called up with a question about their Internet service, they were quite unhelpful - instead of putting me through to someone who could help, they seemed more keen to get me off the phone.Unfortunately it's not only the reception staff who need some urgent training - the service at breakfast was equally as poor. The hotel appears to employ so many staff, however most of them were just milling about talking to each other, rather than serving the guests. On some days, we had to wait for a table, as whilst the table was free, it had not yet been cleared and re-set. For the rates charged by this hotel, the breakfast quality was extremely poor with not enough variety in the menu each day. Many items ran out regularly and were not refilled quickly enough.The room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and whilst it was generally comfortable, I'm not a big fan of the nouveau styling. The sliding bathroom door doesn't have a lock, and whilst the bathroom looks nice, the strange shaped washbasin isn't particularly convenient to use. The LCD TV in the room is a nice touch, but signal quality wasn't up to scratch and quite grainy on most channels. Also, the hotel won't provide an extra bed in the room - only a mattress. We managed to convince housekeeping to provide two mattresses stacked one on top of the other, however it's still not particularly comfortable.So, my overall opinion of this hotel is poor given the fairly high room rate. They really need to make some urgent improvements in the area of customer service!"
118,1728,"Feb 20 2006	Perfectly Fine Hotel	My son and I stayed at The Park for two nights and thought it was a fine hotel - although a bit pricy. It's definately over-the-top as far as modern decor goes including glass-walled bathroom and art in our room. In the bathroom, both bars of soap had ONE flower pedal layed carefully on top. Good shower, but the matress was typical (hard) for India. Great pillows, though. We ate in the casual restaurant for dinner and had very good food (pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven). Didn't get to take advantage of the pool area but it was beautiful. No issues at all with noise. Service was fine. We found that English is not spoken as fluently in Northern India, and this being our first stop up north, we thought it was the staff (some had a hard time understanding what we were asking for), but that's just the way it is (as compared to Southern India)."

1,1731,Oct 27 2009	Velvet Apple - A good stay	We stayed at the Velvet Apple hotel for 6 days in early October 2009. The hotel is located in one of the better areas of New Delhi and is close to the M Block Market (500M walk) and other small shops.The staff were very obliging and very pleasant for the duration of our stay. The room that we stayed in had ice cold air-conditioning and a really fast ceiling fan. The hotel is located in a very relatively quiet part of GK1
2,1731,Mar 9 2009 	Great hotel in Delhi perfect for both business and leisure travel	We spent 3 nights at this fabulous new hotel in a convenient part of Delhi
1,1733,"Sep 10 2009 	great	I couldnot forget my stay with hotel york. I had a good time over there. I felt myself so much comfortable during my stay over there. All the staff are nice and polite and hospitable in each and every way. I have visited so many hotels in my life visiting the mostly all places in India. But never been such kind of amenities and services what I found in hotel york.Indeed, I will definately recommand my relation and all my colleages to visit hotel york at least once in a life Girish parwar"
2,1733,"May 6 2009 	Terrible Place	I had the misfortune of staying in Hotel york a few days back.. by far my worst experience ever.The rooms do not have a fan.. not do they have individually controlled AC.. the AC was controlled centrally at the whims of the owners. Most of the times, it was turned off, as a result of which the room was very very stuffy. The night was really really bad tho.. thinking that the guest would have been asleep, the hotel turned off the AC at abt 11:00 P.M. and despite repeated complatints, refused to turn it on making excusses such as power cut in the entire area, local power cut, fault with the AC etc etc. Finally went to sleep at 2 after been fed up. the guys did not even have a table fan!!The rooms were pretty sad too.. matress was ok but the place was dingy.. too too little light.STay away form this place!"
3,1733,"Apr 5 2009 	Superb restaurant	The rest has a bit of catching up to do. Reception staff did not inspire confidence - don't land in late at night or you are fair game. Room staff friendly and attentive. Room itself ok for R300 - ask to see room, bring bag + haggle there. Make to leave if no joy at first. Agree price, leave bag + get written quote(I just paid cash) at reception as staff can change day on day and they feel honour bound to try it on. Check out central Delhi then eat in restaurant. Food and waiting staff exemplary. Central location best + worst bit, convenient to a lot but lively and noisy. It was much the same 20 years ago, apart from prices!"
4,1733,"Jan 5 2008	Hellhole	Arrived late at night and accepted room in a bit of a hurry. Big mistake. Found a small lizard scurrying around the room, what looked like bedbugs in one of the beds, dust bunnies under the bed, battered walls in bathroom, dirt on many surfaces. Neighbor in next room was blasting TV at 1:00am and walls were quite thin.Gathered up my stuff, returned the key to reception and got the hell out, walked into the street at 1:00am and hailed a rickshaw for Clark International."
5,1733,"May 1 2007 	Cheaters and too dirty - Not recommended	Arrived late and tired in this hotel. We read the review in the Lonely Planet and thought it would be a nice hotel.There where no rooms left (they said), but the Suite was free. Price: 6000 rs. We brought it down to 4000 incl. taxes. After we agreed, they asked us to pay 4000 rs + tax. We didn't agree anymore, because we agreed 4000 rs including tax.Then -out of nowhere - there was another free room. We where too tired and just took it. The price: 3250 rs excl. tax.They told us all the rooms where like this room. So we agreed with the price, but told them it was too high for the room. Soon we where regretting taking this room. It was dirty everywhere. The chairs, the bed, the toilet and the shower. Everything was really dirty. The shower was cold and there was a lot of noise at night from the personnel around the room.The next day we discovered that the other rooms where different and that they cheated on us to pay this amount of money. (We just walked into another room to check)We made a complaint, but there was no way of getting any discount or excuse. We where not allowed to speak with the manager (by phone). I saw his number on the telephone display and went across the street to call this man.He told us that we agreed with the room. In fact we did. But we did not asked for the noise from the personnel, the dirt in the room and the stained matresses, the COLD shower etc... Telling us that all the rooms where the same was a great lie.We paid the full amount and left.Have a look at the pictures... The cleanness of the rooms is on the same level as similar the service they offer you.(By the way: they offer breakfast, but you cannot have it in the York Resaurant downstairs, you have to eat it in your room (bon appetit :-( or in the LOBBY!)"
6,1733,"Apr 25 2007 	Decent place by Delhi Standards	Before I start this review, let me tell you something about myself. I was born and raised in India, allthough have spent the past 7 years in the US and travelled to many countries. So I am used to certain things while in India and have certain expectations in other countries - so my review may be a bit skewed (but not really). First of all, if you intend spending something below $150 for a room in Delhi - expect the worst. Delhi is expensive and every hotel is looking to cash in on tourists. To expect western standards for something below 150-200 bucks is almost impossible. If you go to a 5 star (or sometimes a 4-star), you will get what you expect. Any hotel that says it is 3-star is generally a sham as there is no clear demarcation on what is a 3-star or 2-star in Delhi (or for that matter in india).The reason, I chose York was for the location. - It was on the Outer Circle of Connaught Palace -- right in the heart of Delhi -- so there was always a lot of Hustle Bustle. Close to the railway station and almost central to everything that you would want to see. Pricing is a bit Expensive $87 (including tax), but most things were ok. The room was clean, the sheets, towels, blankets were clean. The mattress was worse than a $40 mattress. The room service was decent -- the waiters do not keep knocking on your door, asking if you need anything. They only come if you call and that too promptly. The hot water was good, pressure excellent, bathroom overall reasonably clean. The area is safe and plenty of restaurants around. Overall, I had no complaints. Just remember - most $50 motels in the US would have far better amenities. But this was Delhi -- and I had lowered my standards before I even started looking for a place. If you hunt well -- you can probably get a cheaper place with better amenities. I was a little lazy and this was only the 3rd motel i looked at.Just as a note of caution, do not book any hotel in Delhi before hand unless it is 4-star, 5-star and unless you are going during peak season and chances of finding a decent hotel room are bleak. Take a pre-paid cab from Delhi airport and keep hunting till you find a good place.Pay the cabbie a couple of 100 bucks (around $4-$5) and he will oblige. Look at the rooms before you decide on the hotel. The cabbie will generally take you to a place where he gets a commission for taking you there, so be careful.Overall, York worked well for me, since I had to stay for 2 nights. If you are going to stay just one night, just bight the bullet -- and go for a 5-star.Hotel Vikram is another good hotel (alltho more expensive) which was recommended to me by a couple of friends. The only reason, I did not choose it was because it was in South Delhi and travelling would have been a pain."
7,1733,"Apr 14 2007 	Disgusting! Dirty! Expensive! Rip-Off! Thiefs!	On our way to Agra from Chandigarh, we where forced to spend a night in Delhi. As this was not planned for, we ended up having to search for a hotel at 11pm in the night. We where looking for Nirula's as that was highly rated by our &quot;Let's Go India&quot; guide, but that has closed down so the nearest was York Hotel.TRUST US, DO NOT GO THERE. It cost us Rs 3,700 (ZAR 650 / US$ 90), the first room we got was all musty and smelt damp. As we thought it was only for a few hours we thought we could survive the room. We tried the shower and it flooded the room. So they moved to another room that was dirty, no hot water and the bath tub had rings. Dirt rings. We decided to just suffer it out as we would be out in a few hours time. The next morning we didn't even take a shower as it was so disgusting. We just took our bags and headed for the train station.Disgusting!"
8,1733,"Jun 25 2006	Raised rates at checkout	When I checked out, the hotel raised the rates by 50% over what we had agreed on when I checked in. So I got screwed and obviously will never return."
9,1733,"May 5 2006	for budget stay only	The hotel looks more like a motel than a hotel. Was expecting at least a 3 or 4 star hotel due to the price i paid (booked online) and the lonely planet put it as midrange. What a dissappointment.Overall it's okay and clean (although looks a bit run down) - friendly staff and an overally helpful tourdesk to wakes you up in the morning while you're having a peaceful sleep to ask ifyou would like a car for the day! The place is safe and located at the heart of budget shopping. Just 5 min down the road is Costa - thank goodness!Tips - bring your own toiletries!So if you're planning to stay there, remember to be modest in your expectation!"
10,1733,"Feb 4 2006	Basic	We stayed here in January with our two children (15 and 11) for 6 nights as part of a round the world trip. It was my and our children's first trip to India (my wife had visited when she was young), and first experience of a developing country.The staff were friendly and helpful (tipping is mandatory), and the hotel is quite central (which was a key feature for us). The hotel was very basic though, and Connaught Place is generally fairly run down (except for inside many of the shops).The hotel is situated in K block, which is in the northern part of the circular Connaught Place. The nicer hotels in that general area tend to be on Janpath which runs south from Connaught place. There is a brand new metro station in the middle of Connaught Place.When we arrived at the hotel we found that our room only had one queen sized bed and one single bed (despite clearly setting out by email when booking that we required a room for 4 people - and being quoted a price on that basis), with not enough room to fit another bed. Rather than pay for two rooms (if we had known we may have to do that we would have chosen another hotel in the first place) we ended up having to sleep three people on the queen sized bed.The room did have a TV, hot water, a shower, and a toilet that worked, but apart from that it was pretty sparse, and was fairly dusty (as is most of Delhi). The hotel has room service, but the choice is very limited. The sheets were clean, but the blankets were very old and dirty (with Delhi dust and cigarette ash).The hotel has a man who organises tours/drivers, who was fairly helpful (although a bit on the pushy side). We booked a driver for a day trip of Delhi through him, which was okay but it would have been better to have a guide (or to do a guided tour) - we did a guided tour to Agra through Ashoka tours (a government agency situated in Connaught Place) - which was much more informative and enjoyable.The hotel was renovating its facade while we were there, as well as doing up the adjoining restaurant (which was closed). Even so, I don't think we would stay there again. On reflection it would have been better to pay more and stay in something a bit more upmarket in a nicer area (eg on Janpath) for our first experience of Delhi."
1,1734,Jan 8 2008 	Reasonable hotel	We spend few days at Yuvaraj Delux and stay was pleasant though the hotel is located in a not so good place. The roads are narrow and congested.The hotel management and staff were well mannered. It was worth for Rs.1100 per night. Donot expect the kind of facilities and ambience that you would expect in a Budget or long stay hotels in US in any Budget hotel in India. The travel desk people were good
2,1734,Nov 16 2007 	what a mess!	I arrived at midnight. The staff are not so welcoming. After waiting at reception for 10 mins with my backpack
3,1734,Oct 18 2006	Nice Service!	Thank you for your hospitality and support. I feel very comfortable all staff were very friendly.	
4,1734,Sep 13 2006	Awful place!	We stayed in the Yuvraj for four nights. There was nothing &quot;Deluxe&quot; about it: the room and bathroom were dirty. the bed was dirty
5,1734,Jan 19 2006	Total misrepresentation and disgusting	Firstly my booking was supposed to include a free airport pick-up but the hotel owner insisted I paid 400RPs. I booked a room for 3 adults - my son
6,1734,Dec 8 2005	Really bad hotel in a bad part of town	Looking at some of the previous reviews
7,1734,Dec 6 2005	Do not stay here!!	This hotel is dirty and noisy
8,1734,Nov 13 2005	What do you expect for $15	This is basically a budget hotel and it would seem that budget in India costs more than anywhere else! As with most of the hotels in this area they have spent all of their money on making the reception look nice and have forgotten to renovate the rooms. Our room was dark but pleasantly quiet
9,1734,Nov 6 2005	Don't believe the two previous reviews!	We booked into the hotel after reading the two very positive reviews on the Trip Advisor site. Not only were the rooms dirty
10,1734,Jul 18 2005	Value For Money	Hotel Yuvraj Deluxe is an excellent hotel. The staff was friendly and helpfull. Connaught Place and Janpath are 15 min. walk away. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel	
11,1734,Jul 9 2005	best value for money along with best friends	I had a very pleasent and enjoyable trip to india recently. I not only enjoyed the indian food 
1,1740,Great deal amazing location and awesome service	The hotel is really unique and you get that sense from the minute you walk in. It has a friendly hipster vibe with a beautiful lobby and bar. At night it was a bit of a scene but rooms are very quiet. Stayed in a standard room with King size bed and was plenty big (especially by NYC standards). Bathroom was very modern but maintained the old charm of the building.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a little different experience than your standard hotel.
2,1740,"Nov 25 2009 	Cool trendy and very very black....	Interesting vibe and I loved the friendly but seriously casual (dress/speech/manner) cool staff. Room was just as shown on the website, liked it. Would recommend all, (especially the lobby scene full of cool young New Yorkers on their Applemacs,) with the exception of the dining set up which really wasnt yet sorted out, breakfast staffs attempts to provide hot tea were hilariously hopeless for example."
3,1740,"Nov 17 2009 	Hipster hotel needs things that actually work	We had 2 different rooms in this hotel. I turned in a list of things that didn't work to the front desk but by far the most annoying is the air conditioning. There were 2 a/c units and 2 thermostats but both thermostats controlled only 1 A/C unit while the other just sat there. The decor is a welcome change from the normal hotel but so many annoyances can effect a trip; clocks had wrong time and were a mystery to change, bathroom supplies weren't refilled, hooks that don't hold towels, etc."
4,1740,"Nov 4 2009 	My new favorite NYC hotel	LOVED the Ace. The staff was friendly and bent over backward to address small glitches -- it was hot in our room and within two minutes of our calling, the young woman who was working the front desk showed up at our door with a fan. Otherwise our room, a deluxe king, was extremely comfortable. Nice bed. Fun decor. Food in the newly opened Breslin restaurant was awesome. My husband called the front desk and they brought him a guitar to play for the weekend of our stay. The hotel lobby is quite a lively scene on weekend nights. But the guest floors are well sound-proofed against the lobby noise. And the lobby was a fun place to hang out and have a drink. I would also add that while the hotel has a decidedly young, hipster vibe, my 60-something parents, who also stayed, loved it. Oh, and the hotel staff were also very friendly to our dog, who was traveling with us."
5,1740,"Nov 1 2009 	The Good with the Bad	Two of us stayed 4 nights, starting on a Friday. We booked on Quikbook. We opted for the bunk beds, as it was least expensive. Room 700 was very hot when we entered, and an engineer came to assess the situation, but he really didn't do anything. Room was very small, with no space for even a chair or desk, and we had to stow suitcases under the bottom bunk. Bathroom was good, with plenty of hot water, but no towel racks. No mirror above sink for shaving. Really a lot of money for so little room. With tax, the room rate was a bit over $300 per night. After the second suffocatingly hot night, we requested a transfer and were placed in 624, also with bunk beds but with a desk, chair, a bit of a view and a bigger bathroom. No reading lights at the beds, however, and almost no place to hang a shirt or jacket. Did like certain Ace touches, such as good free wi-fi, a place to plug your laptop into a radio for music, great towels, comfy mattress, nice duvets, plenty of hot water, nice in-room bath products. The young hipsters who worked there were uniformly nice and helpful. The lobby is a place to hang out, with a big library table, wi-fi, lots of seating and a cool vibe. You can order food and drinks. During CMJ music confab they had deejays at night,. The Stumptown Coffee place adjoining has great coffee, which is nice. The hotel is sort of nowheresville, with the immediate area dominated by perfume shops and handbag outlets. But its location makes it pretty easy to get anywhere. Short walk up to Herald Square, and down to Madison Square Park and Union Square."
6,1740,Oct 26 2009 	Awesome Hotel!!	Everything was great about the hotel except room temperature...it was too hot! The staff was wonderful. We got an upgrade when we arrived. True the rooms are dark but we didn't mind. Loved the decor and design. It was a great value for $199 a night. I've stayed in dozens of NY hotels but Ace is now my favorite hotel in New York.
7,1740,"Oct 25 2009 	style over substance...leave for a few more months to mature	Great lobby bar and very helpful and friendly staff but they just don't have a finished product yet, stay in the lobby and keep out of the rooms and you'll have a great time. The first room I was given was half painted black with dim lighting and looked over a central aircon courtyard and into other rooms, upgraded to a room with some light and space then a catalogue of problems, aircon not working, windows not shutting, tv and internet not working, room service sent up a chicken sandwich full of bones. This place has huge potential thanks to the staff and lobby bar but the hotel really doesn't work yet, too many problems and only so much friendly staff can paper over"
8,1740,"Oct 15 2009 	Cool hotel with great value	I stayed (with trepidation) in one of the bunk bed rooms with a friend. I was concerned that it would be too small for two people. I was pleasantly surprised that the room was very maximized by the bunk beds. And those bunk beds were one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in (and that's even comparing it to NY's Peninsula Hotel where I stayed several weeks before.) In addition it had a very nice sized bathroom, with great smelling products. The rain shower had excellent water pressure.The lobby has great atmosphere; was usually a fun scene. Also, ran into some interesting characters throughout the hotel.Positives: Great design for the price; fun vibe; extremely comfortable beds; free in-room WiFiNegatives: Location is in between several neighborhoods, so not very exciting; lighting in rooms is very dim"
9,1740,"Oct 14 2009 	One of the best stays I've had in NYC	My partner and I had a lovely stay at the Ace a few weeks ago for four nights. The hotel was lovely, in location and aesthetic, and the staff were the epitome of hospitality and friendliness. Almost all the staff we met at the front desk had a first name that started with 'A', but our self-founded theory of the connection between that seeming coincidence and the name of the hotel was soon debunked.). The apples near the elevator were welcome, and the photo booth in the lobby was a treat. Ditto for the fresh croissants every morning. The room was lovely, and neatly, efficiently, trendily accoutred, but there was a bit of dampness. We brought it to the attention of the hotel and they addressed it courteously and to our satisfaction.The price may be relatively high, but the Ace in NYC sets a new level of service and aesthetics and Id recommend it without any hesitation."
10,1740,"Oct 4 2009 	Awesome place!	I stayed at the Ace with two colleagues for a weekend before a business meeting the following Monday. Not wanting to spend a lot of our own money before our work functions started, we found a rock bottom rate on the Ace's website - $99 - and booked the room based on good reviews here.Check-in was a breeze with incredibly friendly front desk and bell staff. My two female colleagues were upgraded to larger rooms, while I got a standard room with a view of the Empire State building. My room was small, but more than enough space for a solo traveler. The bed sheets are top-notch -- I would say 300 thread count at least - and quite comfortable. The bathroom, while small, was great - the shower had a rainforest-style shower head, and large pump-style bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were in the shower (no wasting little bottles!). Plus, the towels are incredibly soft and fluffy! And...a rarity in NYC...free internet!The lobby bar is awesome - tasty and creative drinks in a hip atmosphere that ended up getting quite crowded. The bartender helped us get a reservation at their sister restaurant even when they were totally booked solid!I totally recommend The Ace - just watch out for the smaller rooms if you are traveling with a partner or a lot of luggage. Past that, it's a true hidden gem!"
11,1740,"Sep 24 2009 	Fun hotel great service and price-- the perfect midtown hotel	i loved everything about the Ace Hotel--- the funky cool decor, the friendly and unpretentious staff, clean, comfortable and modern rooms, the shampoo/conditioner/shower gel, the robes, the little details like the &quot;Not Now&quot; magnet to put on your door, free wifi, PERFECT midtown location-- we walked to the hotel from penn station, walked from the hotel down to the East Village, and up to Central Park. the bar and lounge/lobby area has the best vibe and comfy seats--great place for a first or end of the night drink. lots of room for groups of friends. complimentary breakfast includes coffee and croissants. i guess if i had to complain about something-- the elevator is slow. a tip-- i did research on the NYC forums. found out about Quikbook deals. saved a ton of money. and as other mentioned on the forum, we got a free upgrade from the cheap room tot the deluxe!!! and this was labor day weekend."
12,1740,Sep 19 2009 	Best Hotel Service and time i have ever had -and i travel a lot!	I love the style of the old building. Love the music they played. Great for people in their 20s and 30s. Very cool people place. The rooms are nice and funky -a little small but every place in New York have smaller rooms.
13,1740,"Sep 13 2009 	Edgy but unpretentious	Upon arriving I was really impressed with the staff and surroundings. Our room was perfect for our 2 nights in NY - spacious and comfortable and a steal at the discount rate ACE were offering because the hotel was yet to be fully completed. The restaurant wasn't open and there was a guy painting the lobby at one point but it was done very discretely so it was never a problem. After our first night we went down to reception to let them know about a couple of hiccups - but in no way were we complaining. Our A/C had stopped working, our mini bar was empty (and we were worried about getting charged for drinking everything!), we had no shower gel and the pencil sharpener on the desk fell apart when we tried to sharpen our eye liner pencils! The guy at reception apologized but then basically said you get what you pay for - i.e. the cheap rates because the hotel's not quite ready. I thought this was a pretty shocking thing to say, so replied saying I understood that but it appeared to me that they had created a boutique hotel in which everything was for show but nothing actually functioned. They said they would get it all fixed or move us to another room. Hours later we returned very shopped out and in need of a lie down. The last thing we wanted to do was pack all our stuff and move rooms. Anyway, we were being moved and we begrudgingly got together our stuff and followed the porter down the hall........to a super deluxe room!! We couldn't believe our luck - we certainly were not complaining at reception to try for an upgrade , simply to let them know about a few hitches but perhaps they thought we were going to review them as they were new and didn't want to take any chances.....Once ACE is up and running properly I think it will be a huge success and one of THE places to stay in NY. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would definitely go again. The attention to detail is great and I loved the quirky touches everywhere. As long as it retains it's unpretentious vibe then it will be a definite winner."
14,1740,"Sep 6 2009 	Still too rough around the edges	Came here as it's billed as one of the 'cool' hotel spots in NYC. Location is good, if you're after something around all the busy kinda soulless touristy places. We booked through a promotion for a suite for $199/night for 2 nights. The one thing that hit us when we entered the hotel was a smell of damp. Then there was an even stronger smell in our room, with wet patches of carpet - assume there's some aircon problem. Check-in was pretty effortless and our request for a room overlooking 29th was met (bad idea on my part, read on). The room had a guitar (neither of us could play it and it was out of tune anyway!), a smeg fridge, sofa, bed, etc etc. The bed wasn't the most comfortable hotel bed I've had and their decision to use swede finishes for the edging and cushions was a bad one as it's not the easiest of materials to clean - there were lots of suspect stains and even some irremovable chewing gum.I can't get the damp smell out of my head.The products in the bathroom were nice, and the fridge/minibar/snack tray was well stocked and unlike most hotels there is fridge and freezer space to store your own supplies if you don't want to pay hotel rates.Sleeping was a hassle. Lots of noise outside, including very loud prayer which the hotel couldn't do anything about, made for some pretty poor sleep. The hallway is also a great conductor of sound and the metal bedroom doors offer no insulation from the sound and also bang very loudly. Before going for the room service options, check out yelp. They don't yet have a restaurant but they use a number of selected eateries in the area. I would say their diner choice isn't the best but there pizza pick was very good.Still, it was a nice cool hotel. I am glad I stayed here as the suites do feel like a really Manhattan-y place to stay and hang out in. Spend some time having drinks in the nicely decorated and great reception/bar area and you do start to appreciate this place even more. There's even free wifi and computers on a number of floors. Give it a year to sort out all the faults and finish off all the work (they admit in the welcome folder there is still lots to be done) and I am sure it will be a great place to stayBut that damp smell will not go away!"
15,1740,"Sep 4 2009 	Fantastic!!!!	Great hotel: great location, awesome, friendly staff, clean rooms, great, yummy complimentary breakfast and great design. No complaints, no suggestions. Loved it! Great value for $$$$."
16,1740,"Aug 31 2009 	Ace is Trendy and Convenient	I recently stayed with Ace Hotel and had a AWESOME experience. The location was very convenient, only a couple blocks to the subway. The hotel was absolute perfection. The staff was very friendly and the the decor of the hotel was brand new, trendy, and so intriguing down to the very last detail. The rooms were very spacious and spotless. Each room was outfitted with flat screen tv's and decorative items that sparked conversation and down right jealousy of its modern appeal. I would love to have the interior designing crew who decorated this hotel to come to my house. They also have a hip bar on the first floor where the local socialites mingle with the common folk like me visiting for the weekend. I hear a new coffee bar is opening up this week I am sad I missed it, but am planning on coming back for a stay when their new restaurant opens up."
17,1740,"Aug 26 2009 	Ace hotel ace stay!	I travel about 50% of my time for work and can honestly say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. For friendliness of staff and attention to detail it rivals a Four Seasons. I stayed there for four nights in July 2009 and enjoyed every minute of it. The funky rooms, great bar/lobby everything. Look forward to going back again."
18,1740,"Aug 25 2009 	Great... but not for full price.	I got an amazing price for the room I was staying in... (the really cheap room). Everything was going really well until my fourth night staying there when it started to rain. The window behind the bed started leaking and a terrible smell (I think mold) began to permeate the room. The great thing is that the staff, once notified, moved me to a fantastic room for my last night at the same price. The location wasn't where I would have liked to stay... not very many restaurants within walking distance except for a few decent Korean restaurants. The hotel's new restaurant should be opening soon and that will be a nice addition to the hotel no doubt."
19,1740,"Aug 25 2009 	Great Hotel Great Staff	I stayed at the Ace for vacation the second week of August. The staff was pleasant and helpful in every way possible. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The only drawback would be the dark interior. I had to turn every light on in the room to see at night. But the gracious staff more than made up for that. If you are looking for something outside of the typcial modern hotel and instead want a funky hip hotel with cool people and a great bar, the Ace is the place for you. I can't wait to return and stay here again."
20,1740,"Aug 15 2009 	If Jack Spade were to open a hotel this would be it.	I've stayed here twice withing the past few months after staying in their Portland location. While they are still working on the restaurant, coffee bar, &amp; shop, the price was incredible. As with other reviews, the decor is very masculine with reclaimed furniture and accessories. Very unique, urban, and hip. The croissants &amp; strong coffee in the AM made for a great start of the day. I will surly be back again soon. I'm just hoping the price does not go through the roof after they have completed all construction..."
21,1740,Aug 12 2009 	Brilliant!	My friend and I stayed at the Ace Hotel New York during the soft opening earlier this year and had the best time possible. We absolutely loved the look and feel of the hotel which is just very like New York itself. It's hip and rock as you like. Walking along the corridors feels like you're being taken to your very own New York apartment. The bathrooms are very Hitchcokian and I adored my smeg mini-bar. The location is perfect too as very central. Quite a bit of eye-candy for the ladies with the hotel staff too!
22,1740,"Aug 9 2009 	Funky (in a nice way)	Stayed five nights in July-August 2009 in a standard room.Good points:1. Great location. Quick walk to Times square but without all that noise. Near subway station.2. Great staff. Very friendly and very helpful. Lots of useful information on shopping, eating and transit. Lent me an umbrella when it was raining. Let me use the computer for printing. 3. Free internet.4. Free breakfast. The croissants were great. The jam was excellent. Actually got addicted to this morning treat.5. Free apples. They left apples by the elevator. Great idea.6. Funky style. The hotel has a very funky, garage chic style. Very refreshing. The lobby and room were dark but I liked it. 7. Comfortable bed. Nice linen.Bad points:1. Noisy hallway. Can hear everything in the hall way.2. Our room has only a shower. No bath tub.3. Corners of bed frame got in way (bumped into them easily).4. No soap bar in bathroom.All in all, pretty good."
23,1740,"Aug 5 2009 	Friendly staff does not compensate for a terrible hotel	I chose the Ace, despite its dismal location, because I moved away from Portland, Oregon 11 years ago and felt nostalgic for some of what we've missed. This hotel was a big reminder of why we left. We arrived early and the staff was great about checking our bags for us, but there was really no system for doing so. They were friendly and upbeat and we had high hopes. We returned later in the evening for check-in and that's when the problems began. The lobby, as others have said, looked very cool, but very dark. Somewhat Garage Sale chic, and at the time we stayed, unfinished so certain areas were off limits. The problems began when we got up to my room. The room was so dark, it felt dismal and cell-like. Someone described it as staying in a small jail cell. It was also FREEZING. The room heating/air system was blowing extremely cold air into the room, and it was frigid. I called down immediately, and a very nice engineer guy came up to the room, told us very nicely that there was nothing he could do because the type of system the hotel had chosen meant that it was either heat or air, but something about how the system could only be switched from one to the other seasonally. (After a while, he even admitted that the hotel had not worked out the kinks and he couldn't imagine staying there.)His recommendation was that I open the window to equalize the air temperature since it was slightly warmer outside! I turned off the system completely and the temperature rose from around 58 but stayed in the low 60s the entire time I was there. And my colleagues room was the same. We froze!Then, I looked in my fridge, and low and behold, they had left behind a previous guest's yummy sandwich for me. Yuck!I shivered through the night and then in the morning, was really upset when they did my wake-up call more than 15 minutes late. A little too laid back for me! I was lucky to have set my own alarm as well, but if I had missed a meeting or something because of their error, would have been livid. Next, the shower was less than luke warm. Perhaps a by-product of the funky heating system? Nice chilly shower after a freezing cold night. And let's top it all off with the toilet clogging and starting to overflow as soon as I flushed it in the morning. The staff was friendly, but given all of that, and the terrible location, I would never stay here again, and would encourage anyone to look elsewhere."
24,1740,"Aug 5 2009 	Funky design but needs to grow up a bit	We stayed at Ace in June 2009, shortly after they opened. We wnet for the cheapest room (the bunk bed) which was good value for money. The interior design is fantastic.The entrance hall is impressive and the attention to detail in the rooms is great (for example the contents of the mini bar). Downside was that it sometimes felt like being in a student hall. Because the restaurant was still under construction we took our breakfast in one of the bedrooms. Although they offered coffee and croissants with butter and jam, they did not manage to organise any cutlery for two days. The girl who was tasked to look after the guests was more concerned with looking bored and trendy than becoming proactive and getting some breakfast knifes. Unfortunately we had to change room after one night because the air conditioning was so noisy that it was unbearable. In the new room, it was not possible to switch off the air con, which turned out to be a big challenge for the staff (who ended up taking apart half of the system). Despite other teathing problem, which I am sure they will grow out of, I think it is a great hotel. The location is fine, and as said the design is very NY like."
25,1740,"Aug 4 2009 	Modern and funky	My wife and I stayed at the Ace Hotel on August 1-3, 2009. We got a cheap rate due to a promotion, and upon arrival, we got upgraded into a loft.Ace is still working out some services and details - it's new hotel. So, there is no restaurant, only bar. There's free wi-fi internet but no computer terminals yet. However, we just loved it! The location is very convenient - 29th Street/Broadway - a block to a subway stop. The hotel is also very close to the Macy's and JCPenny.The decor is kitchy and clean with luxe sheets and towels, and a startling minibar. Very comfortable bed, although it could be a little bigger to be comfortable for 2 people. Light breakfast is included: fresh croissants, jam, coffee/tea, freshly squeezed juice. It's a little noisy outside - we stayed on the 8th floor. But then again - it's New York.Overall, it's a delightful place to stay and explore the city. The staff are very helpful and friendly. We'd go back."
26,1740,"Aug 1 2009 	nice but...	Got a &quot;cheap room&quot; was pleased with the price. The hotel itself is in a less attractive neighborhood but in walking distance to Midtown so I was fine w/ that. Elevator was musty along w/ hallways. Room was cozy, comfy bed with feather pillows - it reminded me of a guy's dorm room (color scheme).. However I would suggest they vacuum since I dropped something and found a gnarly pube on it...very gross and a disappointment. You can easily hear people in the hallway and the street but that's not too unusual being it's NY...so if you're expecting a good night of sleep you probably won't get it. Breakfast was pretty simply - croissants and jam with OJ or coffee."
27,1740,"Jul 29 2009 	They have thought of everything. It is absolutely perfect.	I love Ace Hotels. This one is no exception. I got the double king suite- which is one of the bigger rooms, for a very good price. Compared to other boutique hotels in NYC- this place has THE best value. Our room had a guitar, a record player, and an awesome retro fridge. I will definitely stay here for the 2 times a month I have to work in New York."
28,1740,"Jul 28 2009 	Intimate boutique hotel with a mix of bohemian luxury and hipster edginess..	I stayed in Room 301 (a deluxe double) with my 16 yr old niece and her friend. We slept well on comfortable beds and perfect pillows - soft and fluffy. The girls especially liked the water pressure in the washroom (rain shower heads, lots of hot water, great bath products, nice towels and comfy robes). The flat screen tv seemed small, and according to the girls, did not provide enough channels.The hotel is dark but inviting. The lobby is designed with comfy sofas, great background music, and a littering of newspapers that encourage lingering in the morning. A complimentary breakfast of croissants, jams, juice and coffee is a nice touch. There's a photo booth set up in the lobby which echos the tone of the hotel - relaxed fun. All of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and friendly! Over the last few years, I've been staying at various W hotels for my semi-annual jaunt to NYC. The Ace isn't as sleek, styled, grand or luxurious as the W, but that's not not a bad thing! I rather enjoyed the laid-back, worn-in feeling of this hotel. A bonus was the size of the room - it felt spacious for new york standards. The proximity to Penn station, times square, and the number 6 subway line was great for booting uptown or downtown. It was my first time staying in this neighborhood - a safe and convenient location. We didn't dine in the area, but we did have a great breakfast at nearby Penelope's (on lexington). We arrived at 9am on Saturday and only had to wait a few minutes. It seems to be a popular spot. **NYC with teens/budding fashionistas**My niece and her friend declared a lack of interest in museums, broadway shows and site seeing. So, ignoring my pleas to wear comfortable shoes and lighten their handbags (did they really need to lug around all that makeup, change of clothes and ipods etc.?) we headed out to explore the city. We had a fabulous time. Some things they loved:1. The Ace (&quot;so cool!&quot;)2. Soho (shopping and the 'scene')3. St. Mark's Place (great for people watching)4. Pinkberry5. The Shake Shack (Burger, fries &amp; shakes! I've discovered that the more they eat, the happier they become. Also, one of the girls loved how relaxed it was here and noted that it was the first place we'd eaten where we could 'hear ourselves and have a conversation&quot; :)8. Tao (ridiculous scene, loud music, servers with attitude...all of which they soaked up! It was an occasion to dress up and have a late dinner. The attendant in the restroom was a new experience for them and they liked the fact that they were in a 'fancy' restaurant. We're all huge fans of authentic Asian food and were surprisingly impressed with how flavorful and tasty the dishes were here). 9. Subway to High St. followed by a walk over the Brooklyn bridge (subway rides were fun for them - lots of people watching, grime and graffiti; the walk over the bridge offered nice views and photo opportunities for the budding photographer in our group). budding 9. Grimaldi's Pizza under the brooklyn bridge (declared, the best pizza ever and worth the 30 minute wait in line. The distinct brooklyn accents heard here did not go u unnoticed by the girls :0. We had fun here; my niece treated us! A sweet moment). 10. Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory (followed by our pizza lunch...vanilla-chocolate chunk is a must)11. Central Park horse&amp;buggy ride at night (we didn't do this, but it's one touristy activity that they showed interest in)12. Times Square at night (the crowds and energy and lights were fun but they were not interested in going into the stores shops etc. My niece was almost pick-pocketed here by someone who bumped into her and managed to unzip her bag). 13. Skip the circle line tours or trips to the Statue. We hopped on the Staten Island Ferry for a fun ride (although even so, the girls seemed were barely impressed).14. Penelopes (they enjoyed the cute charm and the waiter with piercings. Oh, and the food was delicious too).15. Movie theater (Late show, of course. Cab ride to save blistered feet, even better)15. Catching fireflies - unplanned of course, but having never scene fireflies, they spent almost an hour enthralled to the point of chasing, catching, photographing and videotaping them. We discovered 'the green glow bugs&quot; after our evening meal in the park at the Shake Shack. They claimed that this &quot;was the most amazing experience ever&quot;. :O) 16. Museum of Sex (We happened across this on one of our walks but this is one museum they would have liked to have visited - they took pics of the display. I haven't had a chance to look into it though...) 17. Sleeping in. (I took advantage of this to exercise, do some shopping, go for a morning walk, plan the route on the subway map, or just linger over coffee).  18. Hanging out, doing nothing (i think it was a great move to invite my niece's friend along. They had fun hanging out and never once did I hear the words &quot;I'm bored&quot;. They liked walking the streets and people watching, taking frequent snack or walking breaks in the many public spaces. They amused themselves by taking more pictures of themselves and interesting people for posting on facebook than they did of the sites)."
29,1740,"Jul 26 2009 	Right Place for the Right Price	Stayed at the Ace after being moved to different hotels on 2 previous occasions due to the delays in opening. Glad to actually have had a chance to stay there and overall would stay again IF the prices remain low. For higher prices, there are better places in the City.What I liked:-The staff. VERY young, energetic crew. The &quot;doormen&quot; were 3 different young men dressed like they belong in LA rather than NYC. All very sweet and yet professional. The lady behind the bar during breakfast in the morning was also very pleasant. I was less than impressed with the front desk staff, not because they did anything wrong, but because they weren't as &quot;peppy&quot; as their counterparts. -Room was clean, bed (full &quot;cheap&quot; room) was incredibly comfortable and linens soft-Bath amenities were full-size and included shower gel--thank you Ace!-Loved the lobby. So stylish. And the complimentary croissants and coffee in the morning were a great added touch--I wish the coffee shop wouldn't open anytime soon so they wouldn't charge for coffee. What I was less-than-thrilled about:-Location: not the greatest in NYC. Yes, close to the subway (NRW line) but not as convenient if you're a walker. The area is a little shady at night though I never had any problems. Plus, the hotel faces a house of worship where the &quot;call to prayer&quot; is sung several times a day. LOUDLY. This is somewhat disruptive if you're facing 29th St. It doesn't last long, but did wake me up on a couple of occasions.-The bathtub was small. That in itself was not a problem for me, but the showerhead is the center of the tub as opposed to one of the ends. This was VERY uncomfortable. Concerns:-AC broke down for a day while I was there. It wasn't terribly hot (I'm used to TX weather) so it was tolerable. I feel this will hopefully not be an issue once the hotel is fully operational.-I'm curious to see what the upkeep will be like...the carpet in the rooms do give off a musty smell and the shower curtains in the bathtub were ALREADY starting to show the wear and tear (water stains)...we'll see. Overall, if I got an amazing deal I'd stay here again. It is a funky little boutique hotel and if you get a good deal, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here, keeping in mind this is not a place you come to be pampered."
30,1740,"Jul 25 2009 	Terrible Smell--Needs work!!	I stayed @ The Ace, NY for one night on 23 July 2009 &amp; wasn't overly impressed at all. The lobby is very cool, the complimentary breakfast was great, although they ran out of paper plates, so only napkins could hold the croissants, the front desk staff guys &amp; girls were cool &amp; laid back (Ariel &amp; Ben were great) &amp; the overall theme of the hotel is cool----those are the high points. My room (1709) (King Deluxe) had a horrible smell the entire time---it smelled very much like new carpet, combined with a dank smell from the Ancient A/C unit in the room---the A/C also never worked, as it would only go down to 65 degrees &amp; it was hot outside the night I was staying. When I stopped by @ the Front Desk, I explained about the smell, &amp; they offered to bring up some room spray---they couldn't find it, so a girl brought me a candle &amp; matches to alleviate the smell----this worked somewhat, but I could still smell, what the reviewer before me stated as an &quot;Industrial scent&quot;---it was also definitely coming from the A/C unit---once I turned it off (it was very loud), the smell did stop, but the odor was still in the room---it was disgusting! I went to other floors to see if it was still bad, but I smelled the same thing on every floor----really gross. Also, the room was really Dark &amp; felt a little seedy, like the whole hotel.....I don't know, but the corridors to the rooms are enormous &amp; feel dilapidated, seedy &amp; run-down---Honestly, it felt like something out of a Horror film or a Run-down hostel-----just really awkward....I know the building is a typical 1900's building, turned into a hotel, but it felt odd staying here----I arrived around 8PM, &amp; left by 9:30AM or so the next day----I was ready to leave, even though I live in NYC----(The computer lab on each floor never worked, there was trash on the floors, cracked elevator interiors) Also, the bathroom was impossibly tiny (No tub &amp; the shower is TINY, with the curtain clinging to my skin the entire time)---so bad, &amp; there was only 1 tiny window, which made the room dark, even though it did overlook the street a little......If they were trying to achieve a cheap look, they they succeeded-------I was excited for this new group, but was really ready to leave......Patrick(NYC)25th July--"
31,1740,"Jul 24 2009 	A well-intentioned misfire	I am sitting in room 210 of the Ace Hotel, New York. I booked it instead of my usual Murray Hill haunts (70 Park Ave and the Roger Williams) because it was new, because I'm traveling with my little sister and wanted something a little more youthful than the Kimpton crowd, and because I was intrigued by the buzz surrounding Ace Hotels. We arrived this afternoon only to be told that the room we booked--with two beds--was not available. Could we make do with a king bed? We're brother and sister, I explained as cheerfully as possible, eliding all of the other possible replies (like: you guys claim to be a serious outfit, and you expect that someone who's booked two beds will necessarily be happy with one? What if we were allergic to each other? Or about to get divorced?). The front desk folks, to their credit, were as obliging as they could be: I was promised they would transform the couches in our king room into something that resembled a comfortable bed. What has happened, alas, instead, is the equivalent of what happens when you crash at a friend's: sheets thrown on the leather loveseat, which is about five feet long, a duvet haphazardly arranged on top. The thought of the sheets sliding across the slick surface of the couch, my feet dangling from the edge, already has me tossing and turning, and I'm not even asleep yet. I'm going to try to talk about other things now. The room is enormous, and not without charm: there's the promised turntable and the SMEG fridge, although with the creepy oxen painted on one wall (they have no eyeballs, I kid you not), there should be a Gram Parsons (or, heck, Ozzy Osbourne) record in here. The black faux-fur throws, on the other hand, are *so* 2007.The front desk staff has (again) been repeatedly upbeat and winning: when I called to say, uh, this is the best you could do at changing a couch into a bed?, the guy I spoke to sweetly suggested various other ways in which the existing furniture could be rearranged. All this would be awesome--see, this is the kind of place that makes me say things like 'awesome'-- if the guy in question were a friend putting me up for the night, and if I weren't paying for the privilege. Okay, I clearly failed to stop talking about the bed thing. One more practical piece of information: our room is dark: not mood-lighting dark, not olde-tyme-supper-club dark; but more like please don't drop anything on the floor, particularly in certain corners of the room, or you may never find it again dark. Our tv was unplugged when we checked in, and we had to ask the technician to come up with his little flashlight to determine exactly what was unplugged from where. Mere eyesight wasn't enough. If only the whites of the eyes of the oxen on the wall would light up...So. I dig the lobby (cavernous, kind of a cross between an old library and the room where the bankers meet toward the end of Mary Poppins) and the staff seem affable. Our room is enormous. But the design is hit-or-miss and the organization clearly needs work. I think this place could someday be charming, but right now do yourself a favor and ask a friend if they can put you up instead. That way, at least you'll know whose couch you're sleeping on."
32,1740,"Jul 24 2009 	Wait until they've worked out the kinks!	I booked two different stays at this hotel when TravelZoo advertised their sale of $99/night. I booked a room with a full or queen size bed. The first night I arrived at 9pm and they said that they didn't have any of these rooms available, so I'd have to stay in a bunk-bed room. They were supposedly fully booked, so I had no choice but to stay on the bunk beds hitting my head three times during the night.The second stay I was with my husband. We met there at 5:30 pm and they said that our room would be ready in 5 minutes. Half an hour later, we were still waiting and late for our Paul McCartney concert. We finally got into our room about 15 minutes later and the A/C wasn't working. We called from the concert to have them check it and we were assured that it would be fixed. When we got there at 12:30 am, it still wasn't working. There was also this industrial smell. A manager came to our room and said that they were having problems with the A/C in half of the hotel. It's only been open 7 weeks, so they're still working out the &quot;kinks&quot;. The smell was from the new carpet/furniture. He brought us a fan and took $25 off our room which was considerate. The hotel overall is nice, but I definitely would not recommend it until they figure out how to reserve and have rooms ready on time and fix their A/C!"
33,1740,"Jul 23 2009 	Ace put me in a uniquely NYC Frame of Mind--highly recommended	I had a very enjoyable stay at the Ace Hotel in mid-town Manhattan, near Penn Station, and only a block away from a subway stop from which you can get to just about anywhere youd want to go. The Ace Hotel is moderately priced (by NYC standards), recently remodeled, clean, and features excellent service by a friendly staff.I liked the offbeat motif of the hotel. As it could be described as stark, it will not be everyones cup of tea. One persons starkness, however, is another persons bold statement; and in any case the industrial appearance is only a style; the hotel does not lack comfort or amenities (although at the time of my visit it did not have its own restaurant; they do, however, provide room service using the resources of nearby restaurants; and they serve a breakfast of croissants and coffee). All this fits in with a corporate sense of humor that includes its motto, Thank you for sleeping with us.One disclaimer about this review: I received a free upgrade due to the unavailability of the class of room I had booked. I dont know what my cheaper room would have been like; but the room I got had a refrigerator, coffee-making supplies, a manual pencil sharpener (more of that sense of humor!), a guitar (I didnt check to see if it was functional), and some op-art-ish wallpaper to offset the mostly black-and-white dcor. There was a flat-panel TV and a feature-packed but austere-looking clock radio into which one could plug personal audio devices.I highly recommend this hotel, all the more so if youd like a place to put you into a uniquely New York frame of mind."
34,1740,"Jul 11 2009 	Funky but noisy	I recently stayed at the Ace for 2 nights when in NY on business. I had been pretty excited about ACE having a hotel in NY because I'd stayed at their hotels in Seattle and Portland and very much enjoyed both.There are a lot of things to like about this hotel if you enjoy alternative, hipster decor. It is a very cool place although I can't help feeling as though some women might find it a bit too masculine in character.When you travel on business you still don't like to feel like you're getting reamed every which way so it's great the hotel has free internet and breakfast. Overall the staff are friendly and in line with the hipster vibe of the place.My biggest complaint was the noise. I stayed 2 nights and as it was mild, the first night I had the window open. No problems as my room faced the courtyard. The second night however an adjacent air conditioning unit (not from a room - this was like an aeroplane) was on and made an enormous racket. Even with windows closed I struggled to sleep. As it was day 2 and my stuff was unpacked moving room was not practical so I unfortunately had to put up.My complaint at the front desk was met with a typical hipster-like shrug and it did definitely leave me with a bad taste having not slept and then having to front up to all day meetings.So - worth checking out but choose your room carefully and don't expect any sympathy if things aren't perfect."
35,1740,"Jul 10 2009 	fantastic funky chic boutique hotel	The hotel and rooms were amazing for the low price we paid. It is a very stylish designer hotel without the price tag or the fussiness of a designer hotel. The atmosphere is young and trendy but laid back. There are lots of nice finishing touches, lcd tv's, up market toiletries, free fruit, free breakfast, nice robes, free internet access. The hotel is in the perfect location -close enough to attractions like Times sq but far enough away to be peaceful enough to get some sleep. It was the staff that made this hotel, they were so friendly helpful and enthusiastic and went out of their way to help us. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world including several in New York City and for the price this was definitely the best by far and that is not something that i would say lightly. I normally stay in much more expensive hotels but the Ace really exceeded my expectations which are pretty high. And one last thing the photos on their site look good and unusually are a true representation of the hotel (in fact i think it looked better in real life)"
36,1740,"Jul 10 2009 	Exceptional hotel	There are some restaurants you enter and as soon as you see the place and taste the food, you know they will be around along time. Likewise, you can usually tell fairly quickly if they wil be gone in a year. Well I never had that feeling about a hotel until I stayed at this one. The location, the staff, the lobby decor and the stylish way the rooms are set up all make for the perfect combination. The staff combines excellent service with a sense of humor that works really well. I am not that easy to please as evidenced by some of my previous hotel reviews written on this site but someday the folks that run this hotel will be giving seminars to other hotels on how to run a hotel. If there was a way to rate them a 6 instead of a 5 I would have done that."
37,1740,Jun 29 2009 	Be carefull with credit card details!!!	I booked a stay for me and my girlfriend at The Ace Hotel in New York. The hotel was new and not ready on time so they asked us to stay at another hotel. Okay. But at the end I got charged on my credit card from different hotels. The one were I actually stayed and another one. I called Mr. Sudakow from the Ace Hotel at least 5 times but even now  2 month later  I did not get back my money. So be careful!
38,1740,"Jun 22 2009 	the new 'wave' in hotels trend	this is a second message posted because the first one was rated wrong ( probably I ignore this part). I appologise for this and I hope I did not cause any false impressions. We stayed in a Empire States building room view which was amazing but besides that the time we had there it was GREAT! The hotel is not fully finished but if we weren't told so we could not sense that. The interior decorations and mainly the loby are perfect and it gives you a hommy feeling and everything that you might need is around you. You can find here a small library from where you can take books up into your room or stay there and enjoy a good quality reading. The bar area is very inviting and the people are very welcoming and ready to assist you. Each room has different designs and you can find a Gibson quitar besides vintage furniture. You can find different smart messages all around the hotel. It is a unique experience. Also the location is very good as it's very near to the shopping area and most important NYC visiting points ( at the hotel corner is the 28th street subway station), near to Marquise night club (10 min walking) and few more night clubs. Certainly the best hotel and we will go next year to see it fully finished and experience again the ACE."
39,1740,"Jun 4 2009 	Northwest Cool Comes to NY Almost Cheap	Have stayed at the Ace in Portland and Palm Springs, and I travel to NY a lot, so I was happy to see that theyd opened a new property there, and lucky that it was open on a recent trip, or mostly open anyway. The lobby and the rooms are up and running, but the hotel and the Stumptown coffee shop, The Aces usual partner in crime, will open later this summer. I was especially interested to see if the they could transfer their northwest laidback friendly hipster vibe to New York, and for now, theyve succeeded. The staff were all young, but very friendly and efficient, people who seem to have gotten their jobs because theyre good at them, rather than just look good at them. The hotel is in a great location, central to Times Sq., Herald Sq., Union Sq. the Empire State Bldg., Madison Sq. Park, and Chelsea. Its a fun walk, a quick subway trip, or an affordable cab ride to almost any of Manhattans sights. Id booked a standard queen at an introductory rate and checked in for three nights mid-week. I was given an upgrade to a king, Im assuming because it was a slow time of the week, and they were still finishing up their renovation of this old, classic prewar hotel which has functioned for years as an SRO. The lobby is dark and clubby, spacious and inviting, with grand, soaring ceilings, a central reading table, lots of bookshelves and tufted sofas in leather and velvet draped, here and there, with animal skin throws. (PETA types be warned.) My room, done in the usual Ace industrial/bohemian/vintage style was spacious, and not just by New York standards, with a king sized platform bed so comfortable it might make Mama Bear leave home, a crazy oversized pop art canvas on the wall, a table that seats two, with Thonet mid-century bent plywood chairs, an open closet and a full-sized SMEG fridge, stocked full of liquor mostly. The bathroom was also quite large, with a full sized tub/shower and a pedestal sink. They went out of their way to maintain the prewar style in the redesign here, and it looked like what I imagine the bathroom looked like in Dorothy Parkers residential hotel, right down to the brass fixtures, which shows real design chutzpah in this age of chrome and polished nickel everywhere.The room was on the third floor, with a courtyard non-view so it was pretty dark, but this also made it great for sleeping in, which I needed to do, so I stuck with it. The bottom part of the window was frosted, to the hide the view of a hulking network of heating/cooling ducts, a really fearsome looking beast of a thing. I was afraid that it might keep me up, or drive me mad, but it turned out to be a gentle giant, one that purred more than it grumbled and growled, and Ive got to say, I have never been in a quieter room in Manhattan in all my life - and I lived there for 17 years. It made a great refuge from the blare of Midtown.Because the hotel is still in the finishing stages, there were some inconveniences, but the staff was up front about these and pretty efficient about addressing them too. To make up for the lack of a caf, Stumptown coffee and croissants are provided every morning (if you get up in time for the croissants that is.) Until the restaurant opens, they also provide take-out service from several very decent local restaurants, which is actually pretty affordable by room service standards, even with the $7.50 service charge. The staff was good about notifying us of plumbing shut-offs as well, though for something this disruptive, they should have slipped a note under the doors instead of relying on the bulletin board in the lobby and notes in common areas. The biggest hassle for me involved the tests for the emergency alarm system. This happened three times in my 3-day stay, once at 9:00 AM. Cmon guys, it works already! Otherwise, the service was really sharp. Just as I noticed a trash can missing from the bathroom, the maid was literally at the door with one. When I asked her for a copy of the minibar list, someone was at my door minutes later with the list, and apologies. Overall, my feeling is that this place will be a swinging success once all the screws are tightened and the knobs polished. Hard to say how much the rates will rise once this happens, but since they have a number of cheap rooms and bunks available, the place will hopefully remain affordable  and democratic. Single travelers might find cheaper options at The Pod or The Jane, but I cant imagine that couples, or larger groups will find this kind of style, comfort, convenience and service for this price in all of Manhattan."
40,1740,"Jun 2 2009 	Mixed	I live in New York and when my mother came to visit for 7 nights she stayed at the ACE hotel, newly opened. Results were mixed although since my mother got her room for $99 a night, there aren't as many grounds for complaint.The location near the flower district is fine, given the price, but it's a spot that's more convenient than trendy. My mother later found that at night the area becomes deserted, which can be disconcerting. Several subway stations nearby mean you can get anywhere, quickly: from either Herald Square or the two 28th Street stations all between 5 to 15 minutes walk away.Service was the worst part. Upon arrival, there seemed to be some difficulty working out what room my mother was to be given. After about 10 minutes, it was decided she would get a bigger room than she paid for, as a free upgrade. When she came to pay, though, she had been charged for the more expensive room, at $149 a night and had to show the hotel an email she had printed out that proved how much she was supposed to be charged.My mother's credit card company also rang her to say that the hotel had put a hold of over $1,500 on the credit card she used to make the booking. My mother was not told they would be putting a hold on her card and $1,500 amounted to far more than the cost of her stay.In addition, the person who checked my mother out was not aware that my mother had already paid in full two days beforehand and asked for payment again -- even though the hotel's accounts manager, who had dealt with her query about the hold on her credit card, had also dealt with her payment.My mother didn't think the management was particularly apologetic about any of these problems.The upgraded room was small but perfectly manageable (although I think the cheapest rooms must be extremely small) and quite dark. My mother has asked for a quiet room, all of which seem have windows looking out onto the central shaft. Everything was brand-new and clean etc even if the decor was less attractive than the Portland hotel appears to be. Decent bathroom. Iron, hair-dryer, and electric tea kettle considerately supplied.The air-conditioning didn't work, however, and was needed during a prematurely hot May week, so my mother was switched to another room after the first night. This was slightly bigger but even dingier and, strangely, the dated fixtures in the bathroom were completely different from the nice ones in her last bathroom. They were seemingly left-overs from the hotel's previous incarnation.My mother was given breakfast vouchers, as the hotel restaurant is still being built. The lobby is grand in a trendy/dilapidated sort of way. Tacky taxidermy, but pretty fresh flowers. Generally speaking, for the price my mother paid the ACE hotel was great. I would start to question the hotel's value if the prices went much above $175 for the better room she was given. When staying at this kind of hotel you're not looking for over-the-top service but clearly a lot of communications problems need to be ironed out. (The staff at the hotel are very young -- one of them told my mother he had never worked in a hotel before -- and don't seem to altogether know what they are doing.)"
41,1740,"May 29 2009 	The Un-Boutique Hotel	I've been eyeing this property since visiting the Portland, Oregon location with its fabulous Stumptown Coffee House with the hipster/baristas and their fabulous concoctions and the equally exemplary Clyde Commons restaurant with its localvore cuisine and handcrafted cocktails. Initial reports revealed that the place was in a no man's land but clearly as others have stated, the subway station is one block up on 28th with easy access to downtown. Unlike the Portland location with its graphic A, the NYC location has a marquee in lights &quot;hotel'. as if.The lobby was dark with a cabinet filled with taxidermy and leather seating with faux fur throws and wood paneling all around meant to evoke a gentleman's club if the gentlemen were tattooed, bearded and skinny jean wearing. The bar unfortunately served drinks in plastic cups and had my oregon pinot measured in jiggers for precision, disappointment could not have been more precise.The room was well done and honored the architectural tradition of the hotel and the district. The itchy pendleton blanket was iconic and lent a pacific northwest vibe but the sheets were crisp and egyptian cotton and sufficiently threaded. The decor was industrial fin de siecle and masculine. The bathroom did not have a tub but had great &quot;antiqued&quot; shower plumbing with great water pressure and Rudy's barbershop toiletries (think Kiehl's before L'oreal bought them&quot;). Great turkish towels and designer &quot;wings and horn&quot; bath robes along with a roped detox soap that smelled of grateful dead tribute concerts.Sadly, the coffee house was not open but there was a breakfast room managed by the lovely Jennifer and her partner Victoria who made everyone feel welcome. Lovely croissants and stumptown coffee were provided along with the NYT.The much awaited Breslin restaurant under the direction of April Bloomfeld (of Spotted Pig) will apparently open in the fall. Sad, as there are no nearby restaurants of note. Closest restaurant of any note was Craft.Hopping the subway downtown was a breeze and also an easy walk to Chelsea for the requisite gallery hopping.The quikbook quote of 199/night was a good deal even after you add the sales, city, occupancy tax (225/night). This hotel is geared to cool adventurous low maintenance types. Anyone wanting room service and extra attention should check out other hotels. It is clearly not for resort poodles or the old."
42,1740,"May 21 2009 	You'll get ripped off. Go to the Hudson.	First off, let me say that the regular hotel staff were avuncular and helpful...albeit disorganized. Also, the amenities of the rooms surpass those found at the SEA &amp; PDX locations. These are the only reasons that I am giving them more than one star.The problem with this location, and it is a BIG problem, is the management &amp; fee transparency.I don't own a credit card, and don't believe in them, so I use my debit card to rent cars or hotel rooms. The person at the front desk informed me that since I was using a debit card, they would need to put a hold on my card for the three days I was staying, plus a discount from a firend who works for Ace (Approx. $370). I thought that this was reasonable, so I told them to go ahead.Lo and behold, I log onto my bank's website to find out that my account had a hold put on it by the Ace for $1470.When I go to talk to the manager, he informs me that they are charging me for four day (I booked three) and in addition, they are charging me up front for all the incidentals I might take out of the fridge.To add insult to injury, they tell me that I am not going to be receiving the room discount that had been promised to me,Then on an upbeat note, they tell me that the difference on hold in my account will be credited back to me 7-10 days after I check out...'you mean a full pay period?' I respond.Not all of us make an NYC salary, and vacations have to be budgeted for. $1470 is a big deal. Apparently I am not supposed to eat once I return home.Complete [--].After conveying that this is all unacceptable, they finally contacted the bank for me and removed the hold. However, i was still charged the full rate AND the extra day, which I am still trying to rectify.Now, maybe I am crazy, but I rent cars and stay in hotels all over using my debit card. Every time that there are incidentals involved, I sign a form giving them the right to debit my account AFTER I consume them. Is Ace unable to download and copy a Hilton's incidentals form off of the internet, and print it out so that I can sign it?If they had been more organized and up front with me about how much I was going to be charged, that I wouldn't get the discount promised me and the exorbitant hold, I would have turned them down and just gotten a place on Hotwire.The Ace NYC's managerial arrogance and disorganization is remarkable.And to think this review could have been avoided.So to review:- Instead of debiting you for what you use, Ace take out money for items you haven't consumed yet.- Ace will charge you for days that you don't book.- Ace will renege on confirmed discounts.Wait for them to clean up their act in 6-12 mos before you book here."
43,1740,"May 19 2009 	Great place but still working out the wrinkles	My husband and I checked in 2 days after the hotel opened. We learned it was a &quot;soft-opening&quot; as they weren't quite done with all the work. The gym, restaurant, and some other amenities aren't complete yet.We enjoyed the spaces, and the rooms were quite large for NY standards. The service, although friendly, was a bit spotty. I think that the staff are all finding their groove as the place just opened. Once they work out those wrinkles, the Ace will be a great hotel!"
44,1740,"May 18 2009 	My almost stay at the ACE	I went to NYC on May the 2nd and had booked a 10 night stay at the AH. Upon arrival the front door had a funny appearance. It looked dark and very welcoming. A manager came out an announced me that the hotel was not ready for the soft opening.ASTONISHED, SURPRISED, DISAPOINTED, ANGRY, FRUSTRATED were face i went through within seconds.A few minutes later the hotel manager came out and apologized. He added that they have relocated us in a nearby hotel for the same price.CURIOUS, DOUBTFUL, NOT CONVINCED were among the other feelings I felt upon hearing what was going on. I turned around a sedan limousine was waiting for me doors open!A complementary transfer has been organized and we've been driven to our new hotel which was absolutely fabulous! The next day a brown bag from the AH was siting on my bed. A voucher for a comeback stay, a ACE HOTEL t-shirt, a personnal message and an apple later. The ACE HOTEL managed to convince me that they were one of the most promising upcoming hotels in NYC:Soft opening or not, they understand the value of potential customers, the appreciate the investments (time, travel, and more) done to almost stay with them. Their way of managing the situation could not have been better, not even at a HILTON!!!!YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING and i will definitely by back for a REAL stay this time!!!I am myself a hotelier and have been lacking this quality of service for many years and in many famous places!!! Be back soon"
45,1740,"May 18 2009 	A potential game-changer in the NYC boutique hotel scene	I have to start by saying that my initial experience with the Ace was unpleasant. I was told earlier this week, four days before arrival, that the hotel was not ready and that I'd been rebooked -- to be fair, at the same $99 rate -- at a much less cool hotel around the corner. A bit of protest on my part, as well as me pointing out that I'd booked my room almost as soon as the reservations lines opened in January, resulted in a 180, and I was moved back to the Ace.My impressions thus far have been about as solid as it gets for a hotel that's been open to the general public all of three days. While they allowed &quot;friends and family&quot; to stay here during the soft opening over the past few months, permit issues apparently prevented them from opening to the public until this week, so you may consider this the first unbiased critique of the property. The hotel's by no means finished -- not every room is done, and the inevitably doomed-to-be-packed restaurant The Breslin (run by the same folks who own the still-white-hot-after-many-years gastropub The Spotted Pig in the Village) won't be open until sometime this summer, but there's no gym or room service, either, and maid service is spotty. My room wasn't cleaned until 6pm, and they failed to refill the minibar (To be fair, the hotel has &quot;room service&quot; -- at a $7.50 delivery charge -- from several nearby restaurants, including Hill Country, debatably the best BBQ in the city. As a Texan, however, my BBQ standards are pretty high, and I've found Hill Country overpriced and underwhelming on previous visits, but I'm admittedly picky on that front.)Back to the hotel ... the service, barring my initial reservations faux pas (including being sent an e-mail by a manager clearly meant for another manager, not me), has been exemplary. The staff are eager to please, and as they should be: the Ace is a gem. Granted, it's in an off-the-beaten-path location -- sandwiched between the Chelsea Flower District and Koreatown -- and probably better for ex-pats such as myself, or people already famiiar with the city, given its lack of tourist attractions in the area (besides, of course, the original Macy's and the Empire State Building), but it has a convenience factor that can't be beat: within walking distance of Penn Station (well, at least if you pack light and don't mind hauling your bags a few blocks), accessible from both JFK and Newark Airports. It's also a few blocks from the Herald Square subway station, which has connections to the majority of the four main boroughs, and a block from the 28th St N/R/W stop. For east side connections, the 6 train's not too far a walk over on Park Ave South.The lobby is, to put it mildly, dramatic: gargantuan in scale, with towering ceilings and comfy seating throughout. It's far bigger than the Ace's Portland branch, but I can imagine it being put to similar use once the hotel gets its legs, with folks wiling away the day drinking Stumptown Coffee and reading the Times or one of the numerous books tucked into the hotel's lobby -- which, apparently, has remained largely untouched from its days of way back as the Breslin Hotel. (Think lots of wood paneling and built-in bookcases, intermixed with an eclectic assortment of furniture.)Upon arrival I was upgraded from the $99 &quot;Cheap Room&quot; I'd booked to a &quot;Deluxe King.&quot; Although some Deluxe Kings are blessed with Smeg refrigerators, one of my favorite kitschy design items, mine was alas not. It does, however, come with a mini-suite layout, including large leather loveseat and coffee table. (Caveat: while large by NYC standards, the room's smaller than average by non-NYC standards, about 300 sq ft.) The bathroom's on the disappointingly small side, and more disappointingly fitted with brass faucets and the like, including shower-curtain rings. (Didn't someone tell the decorators that brass has been out since the '80s?)My room faces the interior courtyard -- good if you're noise sensitive, as I am, but bad if you want consistent cell phone service. (To be fair, this problem afflicts nearly every NYC hotel I've stayed in.) Request an odd-numbered room if you want a street view (and cell phone access); the area's pretty quiet at night, but gets noisy weekdays during commuting hours and weekends as street dealers set up to sell their wares. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel (a perk no longer available at my other favorite NYC boutique chain, the Thompson set) is much appreciated and helps mitigate the phone issue, since I can make Skype calls on my iPhone.The decor is both eclectic and an upgrade from the creaky wood floors at the Ace Portland. These actually have carpet -- black, which I normally dislike but which works great here (and great for concealing the inevitable spills) -- along with a wonderfully comfy bed equipped with multiple down pillows, down comforter, and, if that's still not enough to stay warm, a Pendleton blanket. (No idea yet whether the HVAC can adequate handle winter chill, since it's mid-May as I write this.) My one issue would be the TVs. C'mon, guys: 42&quot; is the new standard, and you skimped a couple hundred bucks and went with 32&quot; flat-panels for even the highest-end non-suites? Odd, considering the not-cheap Knoll furnishings, including a marble Saarinen Tulip table in the hotel's temporary breakfast facility (open 7-11am, with Stumptown Coffee and not-bad croissant).The Breslin Bar, also newly opened, is fantastic, with the most unique spin on an old-fashioned I've seen to date: one made with reposado tequila and agave nectar. While this may seem like blasphemy to those used to the bourbon variety, it has a truly unique appeal. (Granted, for the time being it's being served in plastic cups, and I do hope they get some proper barware in the near future.)I know this hotel has upset some folks by opening 3+ months late, and by the fact that the $99 cheap rate no longer seems to be available (at least not for any dates I checked - I'm not counting bunk-bed rooms here, since I refuse as an adult to sleep in one), but at the very least let it get past its teething pains, finish all the rooms, open The Breslin, and give it a chance come maybe September or so. I've stayed in most of the city's boutique hotels at this point, and thus far the Ace has impressed me nearly the most -- if only because it's avoided formulaic luxury in favor of individualism. In fact, the only hotel I've stayed in here that comes close is the storied Chelsea Hotel -- but that's a whole other story entirely, given its history (and the fact that most of its occupants are permanent)."
46,1740,"May 5 2009 	Finally: Cheap hotel in Manhattan	It surely is the dream of the frequent traveler to come across a true gem every once in a while. The Ace Hotel is one such gem. It shows that hotel prices in Manhattan dont have to skyrocket as they use to. Hotel manager Jan Rozenveld promises to always offer a remarkable number of rooms for 99 Dollars (big enough room, but with bunk beds), even on Thanksgiving-weekend, even in the holiday season, even on 4th of July. For the price of a better hostel Ace Hotel offers not only 4-star-comfort with private bathroom, minibar, private bathrobes, 24 hour room service and free Wi-Fi, but also no less than the ideal location. Ace Hotel is positioned in walking distance to Herald Sq., Macys, Empire State Building and Times Square. Subway, Bus and Penn Station are nearby.The neighborhood, called Nomad (North of Madison Square) is on the rise. Ace Hotel, which is in soft-opening phase right now, claims to be one of the future centers of Nomad with a huge lobby as meeting point for travelers and locals alike. Although Ace Hotel could be described as a boutique hotel to a certain extend, manager Jan doesnt want to hear that word. He rather speaks of a house which fulfills travelers needs. Just as in a deck of cards, where the Ace can have the highest and the lowest score, the Hotel has, besides the 99 dollar rooms, suites that sell for far more than 1000 dollars per night.Staff of the hotel is young, enthusiastic about the job, eager to help wherever possible (we forgot one piece of luggage on the belt at JFK and hey, they organized delivery to the hotel). Rooms are decorated in an eclectic way, all with individual charme. One as examples: One has a guitar standing in the corner, another one shows a turntable with a remarkable collection of LPs (for the younger ones: A LP is kind of a large, black CD which is filled with music on two sides). Many of items in the rooms are from flea markets, unique and not seldom a feast for the eyes. The gigantic library in the lobby, for example, has been brought over from a 5th Ave apartment.What we liked a lot is the humor spread all over the place. When you leave the elevator, the rooms are to your left and only a window front is to your right. A sign with an arrow to your right reads: Not much there. The slogan of the hotel, stop sleeping around, still amuses us, as well as the final Thank you for sleeping with us.We will, for sure, sleep with Ace Hotel again and again."

1,1746,"Sep 24 2009 	Great Hotel! Nice Room!	I love everything about AKA United Nations. The hotel is kept well and in modern deco. Room is very comfy, clean and well equipped. This was definitely a five star experience! The room is huge!The staff is friendly and the location is great!Very highly recommended!!!"
2,1746,"Sep 11 2009 	Great and friendly staff!! Very helpful!!	Had a great time in NYC! The staff at A.K.A made it even more enjoyable. Very friendly and knew a lot about the area. Suggested great restaurants and places to go!! At the end of the night always staff always asked where we went and how we liked it. The rooms are nice. Fairly clean, but not like home. I consider myself a hotel snob and can be very critical, however I would absolutely stay again."
3,1746,"Oct 27 2008 	Noisy Construction Work Service Okay	We stayed at the AKA United Nations while visting New York. The location was convenient and the facilities clean and adequate. However, the place was next to a construction site and we were woken up at 7AM every morning (including weekends) to the noise of heavy drilling and other construction work. Traffic noise (honks from taxis and garbage trucks) was bad every night (even till 2AM in the morning!). Our friends stayed at one of the rooms facing away from the main road and said that noise was slightly better. However, her room was right next to an old office building with workers looking in to her room all day and did not get enough light. Service was so-so. The in-room internet service was slow and had been inaccessible on few occassions (during the evenings)."
4,1746,"Jul 22 2008 	Lovely	We stayed in NY over the Christmas / New Year holiday and I have to say we were delighted with the property.The complex is new, modern and spotless throughout. As for the apartment, it was exactly like the photos on the website we had used.There is a selection of tea and coffee and snacks (mini muffin or scones) available each day in the loby.The staff were very friendly and hepful.It's in a great central location and I would definately consider staying here again."
5,1746,"Apr 1 2008 	Better known as AKA United Nations	A fantastic find...Booked AKA UN for 5 nights for a Spring trip - we were going to stay at the Marriott Residences to get the advantage of a kitchen - but for the same price as a studio there we booked a one bedroom apartment here - and appeared to be a much better buy.Position not immediately central - but only 5 min walk from Grand Central Terminus, or UN the other way. You could hear the traffic on 3rd ave - but only if you left the windows open. AKA is in a residential side street.Reception and doorman always friendly. The apartment was spotless with everything you wanted - well equipped kitchen, comfortable bedroom and lounge. Bathroom a little small - but good shower. Services every day - only minor criticism was that dishwasher powder not replaced daily.Light breakfast served in morning by reception and coffee available all day. There was a 24/7 corner shop - but a better bet was the supermarket just up 2nd avenue a few mins walk - this was also near the Manchester pub (a good English style pub - good beer and food ok), and next door to that a great Chinese restaurant and take away.Overall - a great visit to NYC and I'll certainly return - also have AKA at the right place to stay."
6,1746,"Nov 11 2007 	Needs attention soon	I bought a package at the United Nations property on LuxuryLink.com and was disappointed after having stayed at seven other LuxuryLink hotels. This extended stay facility isn't a true hotel and doesn't have the level of maintenance that a hotel would have. The floors are peeling, the drapes dirty, the linen rough and scratchy. It does have much more space and a kitchen that a hotel room wouldn't have. The decor is serviceable although getting a bit worn. For what I paid, I felt it was OK but if I'd paid their standard rates, I would have been quite upset.And the drunk guy singing in the halls one night didn't help! Security isn't sufficient to handle a situation like that.Staff is friendly and tries but quite young and inexperienced. Housekeeping wasn't quick to clean when we requested it, the phone and the air conditioning weren't working properly in our unit.All in all, I won't be back and others should be aware that this isn't up to a hotel standard."

1,1749,"Nov 22 2009 	Great location and that was it!	Overall the hotel was not great, the only positive was it's location which was brilliant. The rooms were so small that we struggled to open the door far enough to get our suitcases in when we arrived. The room was very poorly lit therefore very dark because there was very little natural light as the window was so small and if you did open the curtains fully you got a lovely view of a brick wall. The staff on reception were not overly helpful either. The only time they were was when we were trying to arrange transport back to the airport and they forcefully tried to sell their private transfers which were more expensive!"
2,1749,"Nov 8 2009 	Brick Wall!	If you want a central hotal at a cheap price, and won't be spending much time in it then this hotel is fine. The bedroom was very small with an outlook on to a brick wall, very hot as well even in October. To be fair it did have an air-con fan in the room which was needed to get rid of the smell of smoke!The bathroom was great though, and fresh towels everyday.Reception staff helpful and friendly, and a great little cocktail bar connected to the hotel.At the end of the day you get what you pay for, and to sight see for 5 days this hotel was fine due to it's great location."
3,1749,"Nov 6 2009 	Good location poor room quality	Pros:: Clean, comfortable bed, great location, nice staff, good priceCons: Smallest hotel room we've ever stayed in which is OK... but you don't have much room to do sit, except on the bed. The room was only as wide as a queen bed with 2 small night stands on either side. So the width was about 8 feet. In the tiny bathroom, we had a hot water pipe which ran from the ceiling to the floor and sat about 1 inch from the toilet seat. That room was like a sauna and there was no way to cool it down...except to open the door. The rooms are dark with a tiny window and a dim lit overhead light.. The problem with the air conditioner is that even in the cold season, the rooms are VERY hot and with the air conditioner not working in any of the rooms (the fan part works) , you will be very warm at night. If you don't mind the thermostat issue and the size of the room doesn't matter, then this hotel will be fine for you to try out. I would only stay there again if I could not find a comparable hotel in regard to location and price."
4,1749,"Oct 29 2009 	Horrible and dirty	Good location, but dirty. We knew that the rooms ar small, but the cleaning was a disaster. We stayed 3 nights and we did not get clean towels but the dirty ones disappered, we asked for new ones, but that was to difficult. And everything in the reception took time, there was always people standing in line. We will new go there again."
5,1749,"Oct 26 2009 	horrible ny hotel experience	very disappointed. we booked a room w/2 doubles for 3 people and they tried to put us in a room w/one king. After much arguing, they switched us. But our room was horrible. Smelly, dirty, ugly, small. Lobby, staircases, elevators all dirty &amp; inadequate. We had a &quot;superior room&quot; &amp; would hate to see the lesser ones. Go elsewhere."
6,1749,"Oct 20 2009 	Very nice location	The location is just perfect - right on Broadway and very close to Times Square.Yes, the rooms are small - but we knew that from the beginning - and who spents yourholiday in NYC in your room - we don`t. Clean - nice beds, fine bathroom and good location - that`s what counts."
7,1749,"Oct 20 2009 	Great location and nice room	My boyfriend and I went to New York at the end of March/early April this year. After a awful start (Delta cancelled our flight after leaving us waiting at the airport literally all day) we finally got here and were really pleased with our choice of hotel. A very kind American in the UK let us use her mobile to call the hotel to tell them that we would not make it that night and they were great and said it was no problem - we had already paid. They were great when we arrived and got us checked in quick. If you need a taxi or any help they were very obliging and helpful. When we arrived at JFK we got on the airtrain line that takes you out to the city (LIRR) which was easy to use and not expensive. Once we got to the subway station we were a wee bit unsure and had been planning to walk but we got chatting to a chap on the LIRR and he said he was going in the same direction as us and said it was a fair walk so best to take the subway. He very kindly helped us buy tickets out of a machine (we got a 10 trip ticket I think) and off we went. Once we got to our destination (he indicated which was our stop but you can see it clearly if you get a good map - we used the lonely planet guide for getting about when we were there) we just walked up the stairs and we were at the corner of the street for the hotel. We actually managed to walk past the hotel as the entrance is quite small and the signage is discrete. If you see the next subway station (next to Subway the sandwich place) you have gone too far if you have come up at the top corner - can't now recall which avenue end the subway station is that we came up. A quick walk back along and you'll find it though and you should be able to see a theatre to your right if you have your back to the buildings. The hotel is fantastically located. The subway stations (there are 2 on the street one at the corner and the other about halfway down the street) are close, there is a Subway, Starbucks not far (if you take milk in your tea/coffee ask them not to fill it too high as they seem to fill them right to the top over there). There is also a dunkin donuts, tads brolied steak (my boyfriend loved this place) and a KFC. Times Square can be seen if you come out of the hotel, walk along to your right and then turn 90 degrees to your right. The room itself was relatively small but hey it was 100 a night and we were in central New York - you're not exactly there for the room! The bed was comfy, there was a TV and a small bathroom. The shower pressure was good and tolietries were provided. The room was cleaned each day and fresh towels provided. We were really very happy with the room. The room didn't have much of a view but we really didn't think this was important. The only gripe would be that the bathroom floor tended to flood from the water from the shower so we just put a towel down. Can walk to all the main attarctions very easily from here (which we did for the first 4 days) and then our feet were killing so we started taking the subway instead! We saw lots of people on our flight buying new shoes over there as you do alot of walking!!We went on 2 tours - the Sex and the City tour and a New York bus tour. The Sex and the City tour was ok but not really anything special but the New York bus tour was great - will get my other half to tell me who we went with for that as it was excellent and would recommend. We did most of the major attractions whilst there and found the hotel to be a perfect base."
8,1749,"Oct 12 2009 	Great location nice little hotel	1 night in this hotel in the theater district proved not to be enough. Wish we could have stayed longer. Rooms are small, but up to date. Clean and comfy. Great staff, snappy little lobby. And, located right near the subway, times square and lots of broadway theaters. We will stay here again when we're in the area."
9,1749,"Oct 8 2009 	Location fantastic	Enjoyed 5 days recently first time in New York. The location was so handy to everything, subway included. Times Square, theatres, shops restaurants etc. The hotel was very pleasant, excellent value for the price we paid, nice enough room, reasonably quiet. The desk staff and doorman were helpful. We did not eat at the Japanese restaurant or have breakfast there. Free coffee is available in the foyer all day.We walked almost everywhere as we wanted to experience everything tho the subway was very close by. We bought a NY ciity pass $79US which gave us free entry into the attractions and most important of all, no waiting in line up queues. Felt very safe at night in that area."
10,1749,"Oct 3 2009 	Great Location - Bad hotel	The hotel was ridiculously overpriced. The area, being close to Hell's Kitchen and its great selection bars/restaurants etc, is probably the only positive thing to mention. The staff is just &quot;ok&quot;, the rooms are SO SMALL I could not believe, literally!! I have never slept in a room of this size in my entire life. (like staying in a box)I would never come back to this hotel!"
11,1749,"Oct 1 2009 	Great location. Very helpful staff...especially the door man	My boyfriend and I have just stayed at the amsterdam court hotel.........After reading the reviews we were a little worried after booking through expedia. When we got there, we pleanstly suprised. what do people expect from a budget hotel in new york. Our room was clean and big enough for the 2 of us. Our room was cleaned everyday and towels changed. Free coffee was a bonus in the lounge. the reception staff were very helpful with tips on where to go and gave us directions and discounts to certain attractions. You are so close to times square and all the theatres and start of the bus tours(which u should take with GRAY LINE. on the same street is radio city. we found a great bar called 230-fifth rooftop garden. You must go amazing views of the city(all lit up) especially empire state builing.On our journey home we booked a shuttle bus through the hotel when it did not arrive the doorman was very helped, he rang the company to complain and then booked us a limo which the hotel paid the extra dollars to get us to the airport. THANKS.. overall we loved our stay in NEW YORK and would stay at this hotel again. For the price u pay u can not be disapointed. U only sleep in your room at night unless your sad. AAAAAA+"
12,1749,"Sep 29 2009 	Great Hotel with Friendly Staff in a Great Location	Myself and my partner had read all the bad reviews on Amsterdam Court before leaving on our trip so were somewhat dubious when we arrived. We were checked in by Liz who was extremely friendly she gave us a nice spacious room and lots of advice on where to eat and night life in the area, her knowledge of the city was fantastic. Our room was a good size by NY standards, the only thing I would say is check your air con works because if it doesn't the rooms get extremely hot. Housekeeping came in everyday and our room was always clean and tidy when we got back. Reception were always happy to help with enquiries we had and I really have nothing bad to say about the place. As far as we are concerned we got exactly what we paid for and I would definately go again."
13,1749,"Sep 20 2009 	Great Location-terrible hotel	Beware of the &quot;Sorry Sir but we've had to place you in a small room (Cell Block 401) as some of our rooms have been water damaged&quot; bullshit story. Couldn't open more than one suitcase at a time and the staff were rude and arrogant. A really poor start to our NY visit. You have to insist that they change you to another room - don't back down and make them commit! The location is excellent but I would not stay there again as I'd rather pay a little more than stay in this dump. Don't get me wrong, my expectations were too presumptuous but this was appalling."
14,1749,Sep 20 2009 	Good for the Money	Good location. Good bed. Great value for money. Not an immaculate place but if you can deal with that it's fine. It did smell a little. If you are after 5 star luxury stay somewhere else. If all you are going to do is sleep and shower it's fine. Service at reception was blunt but efficient. They offered us a later check out which was appreciated..
15,1749,"Sep 15 2009 	Deceptively nice lobby	While this hotel is in a great location for first time visitors to New York, I found it generally disappointing. Upon arrival we were moved for our first night to a sister hotel due to flooding in some of the bedrooms. This was described as one of their 'Five Star Rooms' in the Ameritania hotel, but was in fact very basic and not very well finished. Staff at reception in this hotel were not very friendly. When we returned to the Amsterdam Court the next day staff at reception were slow and not very polite. Door staff however were very polite and helpful. Our room was fairly small, which I understand is to be expected for the price and location of this accommodation. There was virtually no daylight in our room as it was at the lowest level of a lightwell. There were no towels in our room when we arrived and when we requested them we were told that they were in the laundry and wouldn't be ready for 'a while'. There was graffiti on the bedside table and I felt that our room in general did not equate to photographs of rooms shown on Hotels.com or on the hotels own website."
16,1749,"Sep 6 2009 	Average hotel great location	I stayed here at the start of March 09, it snowed on the first day. I found the reception staff not very friendly and not very helpful considering there was a mix up with the booking. The hotel was fairly modern.The room was large and spacious, radiators didnt heat up very well and the mattress was awful. The room wasnt cleaned very well during the stay but the beds were made. The shower in the bathroom was poor.The location of the hotel was fantastic as it was just 2 minutes walk from time square, its literally just round the corner so bring your ear plugs!The complimentary coffee was good."
17,1749,Aug 30 2009 	great hotel lovely rooms great price and locate	we stayed for 5 nights in July 2009. when we arrived we were told we had two single beds instead of a double bed for the first night and then they would change us. but our room actually had two double beds and was a lot bigger than expected.i had read alot of other reviews about the rooms being small but if you are travelling to new york you dont spend a lot of time in the room. we would often come back to the hotel in the afternoon for a little rest and then get ready to go out again. the hotel is perfer for this as the location is great- right near times square and a subway station. only a 10 minute walk to central park as well. the rooms were cleaned everyday and i never had a problem with the bathroom. this place is perfect and very affordable for a nice hotel in new york in that locate.
18,1749,"Aug 5 2009 	absolute worst room customer service (photos included)	The location was great but I'd rather stay somewhere else and pay a few extra dollars. Don't be fooled by the nice air conditioned lobby. Ask to see a room and sit in it until you are satisfied with the temperature before you sign anything. We booked two rooms-both of which had faulty air conditioners. We complained the first night..and every night thereafter.The &quot;engineer&quot; came to fix it and after taking off the cover and rattling it around a bit told us it was fixed and left. It was not fixed and didn't cool the room at all. The tub didn't drain properly and we had to shower standing in 4 inches of water. They moved us to another room with a king bed instead of two queens. This A/C worked, so we opted to keep this room. The other room had hair on the sheets (not talking head hair here- see photo). They brought us clean sheets but since the cleaning staff went home at 7 (it was 9) they left them on the floor outside the door for us to change. The sink was dirty (see photo) The lights are so dim you can barely see to put on makeup. There is one tiny shelf for toiletries, and barely enough room to walk around the bed. The halls always smelled of smoke. The elevator was slow. Wifi will cost you an extra $15 a day. Only thing free is the coffee if you make it past the bouncer guarding the $10 Continental breakfast. There was one helpful desk staff who got the manager on the phone. He actually accused us of trying to get our money back when all we wanted was a cool room. He was kind enough to give us $50 off the first night, BFD- the bill was $1600+. If you make the mistake of staying here, room 302 has an A/C that works. Room 324 does not. If you need to complain, ask for the manager, his name is Robert, not that it will do you any good but I will get some satisfaction knowing you are waking him in the middle of the night. Direct quote from him-I kid you not.... &quot;for future reference, you should complain to a manager not the front desk.&quot;"
19,1749,"Aug 5 2009 	Unbeatable location reasonable price small and darm rooms staff not very helpful	I stayed in Amsterdam Court Hotel for 3 nights in July 2009 during my leisure trip to NYC. The lobby and restaurant look very fancy, the rooms are also in modern design. The rooms are small and dark, some of them having only small window to the inner center of the block but that is unfortunately true for many other NY hotels, even those twice as expensive as the Amsterdam Court. The staff at the reception is helpful, this however does not apply to maids and other staff. We had a stain on one of the bed sheets and it took forever to have it replaced.The best of this hotel is however the location (3 blocks of the Times Square) and value for money."
20,1749,"Aug 4 2009 	i've stayed at a nicer motel 6	This was by far the worst hotel experience i've ever had. We were planning a somewhat budget trip and came across this hotel on travelocity. We were not expecting anything too extravagant, and we were very pleased with the location and lobby. When you get beyond the lobby -game over! We booked two rooms -neither of which the air conditioner worked. We were able to move one of the rooms...and it was a little cooler. My 65 year old mother had to pull her luggage up three flights of stairs because the service was so terrible. The elevator was broken and no one was willing to help. Right before bed, we noticed hair (not from one's head) on our pillows. When we called the front desk, we were told the house keeper left at seven. Someone did bring us some clean towels though...even though we requested sheets. After telling them we needed sheets, they brought them put them on the floor in front of the door, knocked, and left. We put our new sheets on ourselves. Our sinks were dirty and the toilet had a ring around it. The rooms are smaller than a cruise ship and there is no room for even a suitcase. If you're a woman, I do not recommend staying here just based on the lighting. It is impossible to apply makeup in the room without looking like a clown upon leaving. I have never been so dissatisfied in my life."
21,1749,"Aug 4 2009 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in!	I was traveling with 4 women. we picked the hotel because of the inexpensive price and location. The location is really good, but that is the only good thing. We booked two superior rooms with double beds.When we arrived in the middle of the day there was nobody there to help with our luggage, so we did it all ourselves. Both air conditioners were awful. we complained on the first night and they were able to change our room to one with a king bed. The other double room had hair(?) all over the bed. we called the front desk and they brought sheets and laid them on the floor outside and knocked on the door and left. the rooms were dark, cramped, dirty, and the maids smoked in the supply closet all day. We had to request that the toilet be cleaned after we had been there for three nights. We requested towels we never got. the service was pathetic. the only time the staff even spoke to us was to try to sell us a private car ride to the airport. I did finally complain so much that they allowed me to speak to the manager on the phone, I guess he is either hiding in his office or not on the premises. He was rude and unhelpful. he actually yelled at me on the phone. Do not make the same mistake we did. Go anywhere else!"
22,1749,"Jul 26 2009 	Good hotel but tiny rooms	If you are on a budget then this is the hotel for you. The only thing that you get is a room and a basic breakfast. However, the rooms are tiny and there is not enough room for two grown adults. We just slept in the room and went round New York in the day. The rooms are clean though and of an appropriate standard. Not sure if I would stay there again though as the size of the rooms did let it down. However, if you want a central location for a cheap price then this is for you."
23,1749,Jul 24 2009 	Good location but wasted!!	We spent 15whole nights at that hotel! The room was so tiny and dark even with a small window. At first we thought that there was no bathroom (it was behind the door)! We were lucky that we had warm water for shower..and the only reason we hold out was because we were out all the time! Don't expect good cleaning just the minimum but soon you'll notice that the room is full of dust...Don't be drifted by the photos that show only the renovated restaurant and entrance..and not to mention the unthinkable price of 2 mojitos at their bar $31 total when they advertise $9 each!You can eat and drink in nice places with this price! The only good thing was the location nothing else!
24,1749,"Jul 20 2009 	Good location but many faults!!	I used this hotel for my first NY experience. The location is AMAZING!!! its just up from Times Square, in a nice area.Be careful if you want to book for 3 people, we had booked from an outside website for 3 people in a superior room. When we got there we were charged an extra 20$ per night for the third person!! We were shocked and disgusted! But we had gotten it for a good price so we didn't mind 'too' much.The room was nice, but not very clean. The bathroom had no window or vent or fan so the steam from showers stayed there for a long time! The room was also decorated modern!There was free tea and coffee which was great after a long day of sightseeing! Overall the hotel was good, and would recommend for location but maybe be careful of costs... etc."
25,1749,"Jul 15 2009 	Don't waste your money	I'm a frequesnt NYC traveller, usually for day trips, but this for for a weekend away. I had gotten a good price on this hotel, so I was expecting the room to be very small (but who goes to NYC to stay in the room anyway?) Checkin actually went pretty smooth. We got to the room, which was literally just a bed and a TV with a view of an alleyway (not recommended for the claustrophobic) After dropping off our bags, we went out. This hotel was located about 2-3 blocks from Rockefeller Center and across the street from the Gershwin Theatre and the Circle in the Square Theatre so in fact it was a really great location.After coming back a few hours later we realized our room was pretty hot even though we had turned on the AC full blast when we left. Called the front desk &amp; they sent up a repairman who said the AC was broken and couldn't be fixed til morning, but opened the window for us. Gee thanks!So I went down to the front desk &amp; had them change our room because I did not want to sleep in that sweat box all night. After swithicng to a new room (slightly bigger, w/ a better bathroom and nicer view- but still as small as a walk in closet) we were in bed when at about 11pm the door busts open. The hotel had booked someone else into the same room and given them a key. So after being extremely shaken up I tried to call the front desk only to discover that the phone was broken. So at around 11:30 had to get dressed and walk down to the front desk to explain the problem. They were &quot;very sorry&quot; but that was about it. So the next morning we are awaken by a repairman at 8:30 (even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door) wanting to fix our phone. We sent him away and since we were now up, went down to the front desk who said they would move our room again if we wanted. The front desk wasn't rude or anything, but wasn't really sorry that all these things kept happening.We left the next day, making our displeasure known when we checked out. When we stay in a cheap hotel in NYC again, it will not be this one. This was by far one of the worst places I have ever stayed in."
26,1749,"Jul 11 2009 	Amsterdam Court	Tiny room that smelled funny. I'm not sure if it was smoky or just old.But for $100 a night, couldn't beat the location!! The staff was always helpful."
27,1749,"Jun 27 2009 	Great location clean room 	We stayed here in mid-June and it was just what we were looking for: a clean, affordable room near Times Square. It's location on 50th between Broadway &amp; 8th gives quick &amp; easy access to Metro Lines that easily connect you to the city. We always walked to Times Square a few blocks South, just to soak it in. There's plenty of food option near Times Square, but also good places on 8th near 50th. Also, there's some Walgreen/CVS type stores nearby. We didn't eat at the restaurant here, but we did visit the bar and we loved the unique mixed drinks!We will certainly stay here again!"
28,1749,"Jun 18 2009 	great service at this hotel very central to all attractions yet quiet	The hotel is in a great location 10 mins from central park, times square. The room was cleaned every day with lots of fresh towels, good shower, iron and hair dryer. We had a superior room which was a great size. The hotel is quiet at night and has a restaurant attached to it. New York is a great city with amazing museums- Frick, Moma,we went to see great plays which we had booked in advance, great places to eat East side,greenwich village, meatpacking district. Although the boat ride to the Statue Of Liberty is very touristy to the skyline is quite breath taking."
29,1749,"Jun 1 2009 	Do not stay here unless you just don't care much where you sleep	Oh, Lord! Open the door and boom--there is the bed? Ouch! Ouch! Bang your toes into the bed 5 times a day trying to manuever around this broom closet? No--this is not the typical sized NY room--do not believe it. And the toilet overflowed daily--I will not describe this mess! The people were pleasant enough. And the location is excellent. It's dimly lit everywhere--who could tell if it were clean or not? The location is excellent though, and it might be okay for ONE person to stay here for a few nights, but not two, and not us ever again. Fortunately, hotels.com refunded most of our money."
30,1749,"May 27 2009 	valuefriendly staffand wonderful location !!!!	Having been in NYC 5 (or is it 6?) times in the last 3 years,my wife and I reckon we have found the best value hotel in midtown nyc!

(only in nyc)!!! Enjoy, and see you in september xx"
31,1749,"May 21 2009 	So dimly lit it's impossible to read in your room even with all lights on.	I've stayed at this hotel once before and had a great experience. This time, not so much. First, they didn't have our reservation, luckily I had printed out our confirmation and we were admitted (joy). I was traveling with a co-worker so needed 2 doubles, instead they put us in a room off the lobby that had one double bed and absolutely no light. The window looked onto a close brick wall and even when we turned on all lights, it was so dim there was no way to read what was in front of you. We couldn't stay in that room, then in a comedy of errors, they had us look at 3 other rooms to move to that all had people already checked into them. Ultimately, they gave us another reservation's room. It also was extremely dim. They moved us again the next day to a room with 2 doubles and it also was so dim that neither of us could read with all the lights in the room on. I think the problem is that the main light fixture is covered with fabric so the light can't get out. The final problem was that the room we finally landed in had a construction crew jackhammering directly outside starting each day at 8am. It was another property, but made it impossible to be in the room during any daylight hour. Just too many problems to make this a future option to stay in again."
32,1749,"May 10 2009 	AWFUL. Avoid staying here.	This is the first time I have found a bad hotel through Trip Advisor. Check-in was a painful 30+ minute process. The staff are useless. My room was a converted storage closet on the ground floor. There was no window in my room, it was filthy, the toilet didn't work, there was no soap in the room, and there was no hot water at all. Called for a wake up call... they couldn't even handle doing that. My colleague was in a room with a single bed that hadn't been cleaned (there were dirty band aids in the garbage). Felt unsafe and dirty. The best part of the trip was leaving. Will absolutely never stay here again, and hope nobody else ever has to."
33,1749,"Apr 30 2009 	What a ""Central Perk!""	My wife and I are just back from New York after spending 5 nights at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. This hotel is hard to beat for everything and I would recomend to anyone or group. We arrived into Newark airport and decided to take the bus to Port Authority station which cost us $15 each (cheaper that the $80 for a taxi) - what I liked about this hotel was that it was close to public transport too. We managed to walk (and in the rain) with 2 cases for 8-10 min up 8th Ave to 50th street where the hotel was. We were welcomed and quickly shown to our rooms - 7th floor. Ok the rooms are small, but this is NYC and room time was not goin to be important. There was enough room for all our clothes - no problems. As people have said - out the door, turn right and 200 yards you are into broadway and top of Times Square. From here yuu can go as you please - subways are all about to take you all over the city, you cannot go 5 mins withour seeing a tour ticket agent on the street and you can walk to - Top of the Rock, Central Park, 5th Ave, Theatres and if you have good shoes, you can walk to Empire State, Maceys, Madison Sq Garden.Also mentioned was the luggage hold - this is free and very handy after you check out - so you can check out early and still have time to explore.IMO - a very cool hotel that is great value for money."
34,1749,"Apr 15 2009 	So central and good value for NYC	You don't go to NYC to spend time in your room, so the fact that everything is on the snug side doesn't really matter. But it does matter that you are just a couple of hundred yards from Times Square, and exactly half-way between the A/C/E (blue) and 1/2/3 (red) subway stops on 50th.This place doesn't cost the earth, and unlike some other hotels in Midtown Manhattan it's very clean and friendly with functioning bathroom fittings, a pleasant wine bar where you can meet friends and chill out, and some sort of Japanese restaurant. Rooms are pleasantly quiet, without undue traffic noise, so you wouldn't really know that you were in Midtown.Overall, there are hotels in NYC where you would pay a lot more $$$ for a lot less location, cleanliness and convenience. I'm pleased to let you in on my secret!"
35,1749,"Apr 7 2009 	Excellent value in a perfect location	Stayed here with my girlfriend for 4 nights end of March 2009.The room was clean and comfortable and much better than I expected.The heating didn't work properly and made only some blubbering noises during day and night. At the second day we discovered that one can get an additional electric heater and than turn off the strange one and sleep in silence :)Stuff was friendly and helpful, but sometimes quite busy so that it took a while to get something from reception.I can not praise the location enough, it's just perfect.I recommend this Hotel to everyone this is really great value (I booked directly at amsterdamcourthotelnewyork.com and got nice additional savings).Have fun in NYC guys - it's an awesome place to visit :)"
36,1749,"Mar 30 2009 	Good budget hotel would stay there again	We have just returned from a 3 night stay in New York and would definitely return to the Amsterdam Court Hotel. We had a room on the 3rd floor, it was quite small but very clean and nicely decorated. As we were out and about sight seeing all day and only returning to sleep it was more than adequate for our stay. Location wise it is great for Broadway, picking up the hop on hop off bus tours and restaurant row. All the staff were very helpful and on our arrival we were given some money off vouchers for attractions which saved us a couple of dollars here and there. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we did &quot;brunch&quot; at a local deli instead. If you are looking for a budget hotel then I would recommend this hotel."
37,1749,"Mar 26 2009 	Great Location basic hotel	This hotel is in a great location for time square only minutes walk away, within easy reach of everywhere you would want to go and there is an underground station on the corner of the street. The room was very basic and very cold, the radiator didnt seem to work, came on a few times for short intervals, whilst making loud whistling noises. We had the curtains closed day and night to try and keep out the draft. We eventually obtained an electric heater, so this may be a common problem. On the opposite side it may be warm in summer., we tested the Aircon (for fun) which again was very loud. They seemed to have a problem with the hot water, possibly set times when you could actually get hot water! experienced this pleasure only once over 3 nights stay. The room (408) was small but not as small as expected from some reviews. You could walk easily down the sides of the bed. It has a set of two drawers with the TV on, a desk and chair and a small rail above it with a few hangers (no cupboards) The bathroom was a reasonable size. The staff where helpful, and the free tea and coffee is nice after a cold day! They have a luggage hold for late flights as check out is 12pm. For those that dont have Credit Cards expect to pay $150-200 cash deposit (or debit card which can take a while to be put back on!!), they advise this is to cover damages, phone calls and breakfast if you have it.Overall the location was perfect and we weren't in the room that much anyway."
38,1749,"Mar 26 2009 	Perfect location	I returned from NYC just yesterday and can say that the Amsterdam Court Hotel could not be any better located for budget travellers. Turn right out of the front door, walk less than 20 yards and you're already on Broadway. The rooms themselves are basic but perfectly adequate when you will be spending most of your time exploring the city and really just need a crash pad for sleeping and freshening up. That's not to say that the rooms are bad, simply that they're far from luxurious! We stayed in Room 215 (a 'Superior') and there were a few cracks in the bathroom and an odd pipe in one corner but it was perfect for what we needed. Staff were polite and helpful. And the free tea and coffee were very welcome after a hard day pounding the sidewalks."
39,1749,"Mar 24 2009 	Great Location Great for the Price!	So close to Times Square and Central Park, metro. MoMA, boat cruise, etc. etc. Room was tiny but very clean. Comfortable bed. Staff was friendly and as a first timer to nyc the front desk was full of great breakfast and night life recommendations. And really, can't beat the price."
40,1749,"Mar 18 2009	Amsterdam Court Hotel New York	Upon arrival at the hotel, we found that they had &quot;lost&quot; our reservation. The receptionist, although polite, was not overly helpful. She told us to go for a walk for 1/2 an hour while she contacted their reservations department. When we returned it was still not sorted, but she got it done there and then. We still did not receive an apology or explanation. We were given the choice of a smoking or non-smoking room. My husband, who is a very occasional smoker went for smoking - i didnt think it would make much of a difference. I was very wrong! We entered our room to find there was literally a bed and a television. Our suitcases had to stand up against the wall and we had to squeeze passed them. There was no windows and the room stank of smoke. Being in the early stages of pregnancy i felt that there was no way that i could sleep in that room for 1 night, let alone 4. The en-suite was quite dirty and the toilet was blocked. We contacted reception regarding the toilet and also asked if we could change to a non-smoking room, mainly due to the smell. The room we were moved to was so much better! The room itself was about twice as big, there was room for our suitcases and there was 2 windows! The en-suite was clean and quite large. On the positive side, there was no problems with the house-keeping service, the other receptionists and hotel staff that we encountered were friendly. The hotel had a continental breakfast for $9.95, and there was plenty to choose from. The hotel itself is well situated - very central to the likes of Times Square and literally across the road from the Gershwin Theatre.After our initial disappointment with the reservation and the room, the rest of the stay was pleasent."
41,1749,"Mar 11 2009 	Location Value for Money Comfortable	LIke most hotels in New York City, unless you are paying top dollar you dont get a lot of space. The rooms are compact, but have air con, nice en suite's, comfortable beds, and their own irons. You would have to really try to fault the rooms. Noise from the city is apparent through the windows at all times of the day, but then you chose NYC not a country retreat so get over it!! We were there in Jan, which was a little on the cool side, and the heating in the room was struggling, but one call to reception and in minutes a heater was plugged in to help out and we were warm again. Good service from the staff, and everything in good condition. Location is great with a good deli round the corner and Times Square only a couple of minutes walk. I would highly recomment this hotel and would certainly return."
42,1749,Mar 9 2009	Very nice....	it was a nice hotel and location. very clean. Staff very friendly and rooms where very nice.
43,1749,"Mar 6 2009 	The location of this hotel could not have been better	I must admit I was a little nervous before getting to the hotel from reading the reviews online. When we got there we were too early for check in so they held our bags for us (the doorman/bag man was sooooo grumpy). We came back at 2pm to check in and was told it would be another 20 minutes so we waited in the breakfast room, well 1hr 45 mins later we finally checked in! The reception staff were really nice and friendly! The room was great (room 414) much bigger than i had expected, we had lots of space! We could not have wished for a better location, just around the corner from Times Square. I think would take us about 3 minutes to get to the centre. The room was cleaned every day and the lifts worked fine! We didnt have the breakfast as i thought it was overpriced! There was lots of places just down from the hotel to have breakfast. All in all the Hotel was fab!"
44,1749,"Mar 5 2009 	Great Location!	We have never stayed in a hotel in nyc before and had heard that the rooms were small. It was quite a shocker at how small these rooms are. You open the door and the bed is right there. Only a small walkway around the bed. No furniture at all except 2 small nightstands. The bed was clean and comfortable, the rest of the room was old and dingy. The location is great though. Close enough to walk to shopping and central park. I would stay here again for the location and decent price."
45,1749,"Feb 28 2009 	Great Place...very pleased	I truly enjoyed my stay at the Amsterdam Court. The staff was super nice and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location was excellent! There is also parking for 20$ a day right across the street if your staying at this hotel which is great for New York. The free cappucino in the lobby is also awsome and the staff gave us great suggestions for resturants. I would definetly stay here on my next visit, especially if I'de get the same deal I got this time around."
46,1749,"Feb 23 2009 	great location great hotel	this hotel could not be any closer to Times Square and the theatre district. Easy walking distance to Rockefeller centre and St Pats Cathedral, also walkable to Empire State and Macys. Just a few minutes down the street from Central Park and then onto the lovely shops on 5th. Wonderfully clean, two large queen beds in our room, free hot drinks and the staff were not top class but were under pressure and very willing to help when asked. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone."
47,1749,"Feb 20 2009 	First time in mid-town was a treat!	Normally, I stay in suite properties on the East Side but for a one night mid-week theatre get-a-way I took the AMTRACK on-line recomendation and stayed here. A very European ambiance. Small room but nice sophistication and sharp staff. The $10 breakfast was pretty good too. Great find!"
48,1749,"Feb 16 2009 	disappointing	This is the second time staying here and it was very disappointing! I stayed here with friends five years ago and was extremely pleased with the accommodations. At that time, our group had a room with a queen and a second room with two doubles. Both rooms were adequate for our needs. This time, I booked a room that was listed as a &quot;standard&quot; with either a full or a queen. We were given a full, but we wondered if it was a &quot;modified&quot; full! The room we were in (601) was probably less than three feet wide on one side of the bed and about six inches on the other side. It was too small for any furniture, which other reviewers mentioned--no chair, desk, table, night stand. There was a clock radio and phone propped on a three inch wide &quot;shelf&quot; attached to the side wall on the window side of the bed. The &quot;closet&quot; was on the other side of the bed, which was just a rod with a curtain hanging in front of it. The radiator (2 inches from the bed) was not adjustable and made noise all night. The air conditioner in the window had silver tape on it in an unsuccessful attempt to keep cold air from coming in. The very small bed was hard as a rock (you could feel the springs) and the carpet was dirty and run down. It is true that you spend so little time in the room that the size is not the most important thing and the location and price couldn't be beat. However, the cramped nature of the room and the tiny hard bed made the one night very uncomfortable. It is clear that all rooms with full beds are not equal and the uncertainty of which room you might get would definitely keep me from returning to this hotel."
49,1749,"Jan 28 2009 	excellent stay	What can i say, excellent location for starters, times square right round the corner, less than a 5 min walk, i was a bit dubious after reading some reviews, i think some people are just finding faults, after all, you are only going to use a hotel as a base, however it was a very pleasant stay, room was big, with queen bed, large plasma screen tv. nice power shower, some corridors were a bit tatty as were the lifts, but i wouldnt say dirty, lobby was nice and friendly staff at the desk and bar, breakfast if u wanted cost $10 dollars, looking back i wished i had had this as food very expensive in the city, there was also a comlpimentary coffee machine, room was cleaned everyday and provided fresh towels, this is a bargain and i would recomend it to the next person i know going to new york........ ask for room 210!"
50,1749,"Jan 10 2009 	Perfect Location for a Small Price	We stayed for 3 nights right before Christmas to do the typical Christmas-tourist type things. We searched for a month online for a reasonable hotel rate--even debated staying at a few of the skyscraper hotels in Times Square for $700 / night. I would have been absolutely mortified if I had ended up paying that after getting the fantastic location of this hotel for a fraction of the price! Truly centrally located, with a view of Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center when you leave the hotel and turn right down the street, &quot;Wicked&quot; playing directly opposite the hotel...Broadway and top of Times Square literally feet away. As all the reviews have said, it is very small. The lobby itself is small and dark, with a small,. slow elevator. Our room was teeny tiny (probably as small as what we had last time in Paris), with just enough room for a bed and us to scoot around it! The bathroom was also teeny tiny, with the toilet jammed into an alcove that your legs touched when sitting on it! No room for moving. The entire hotel, or what I saw of it, was incredibly dimly lit and the color scheme of dingy brown didn't really help the place to feel light and clean, but the linens seemed fresh and clean and the bed itself was really comfortable. We did have two windows in our room...one overlooked a huge heating unit ont he adjoined roof and the other was tiny and faced a brick wall. We never opened the blinds. The room was plenty warm, in fact we cracked the window at night to prevent being too hot. The complimentary coffee maker was very welcomed as the weather was freezing when we were there. The desk staff were ok, although I did witness the desk clerk and the doorman involved in a loud, heated argument (including shouting and name calling) that went on for at least 15 minutes. I am surprised at such unprofessional behaviour when it was clear that there were many guests around. Overall, this place is entirely adequate for a short stay in NYC. Most people want location (this is it!) and cleanliness (pretty good) when In New York as you won't be in your room very much. It is definitely NOT the Ritz nor does it have the huge corporate glam of those skyscrapers down the street, but for the terrific deal I got on this place, I'd stay there every time. I don't know that I would stay there if the price increased, because I'm sure there are slightly larger accommodations at increased prices nearby, but if you can snag a deal on this place, you'll be set!"
51,1749,"Jan 5 2009	What a dump!!!	My boyfriend and I went to the New York city to catch a broadway show and stay over one night at the Amsterdam Court hotel on December 27. The requested non-smoking room stunk of smoke so we requested another room. The second room was just as run-down and smelly as the first room. There were no towels in the room. The furniture, if you call it furniture, was all miss-matched, falling apart and would not even be accepted by the Salvation Army. Other than a &quot;desk&quot; there was a cheap aluminum book case that was nonfunctional. The bed was hard as a rock; the walls were so thin you could hear your neighbors talk and the room must have been 75-80 degrees and not adjustable. The room was totally run-down looking -- needed fresh paint, new carpeting, new furniture, new curtains. A Holiday Inn would have looked like a king's castle compared to this DUMP. Don't even consider this hotel!"
52,1749,"Jan 4 2009	Excellent Location but wouldnt pay a lot	We stayed here for a couple of nights. The rooms are small,the size of an apartment den. There is hardly any place around the bed to move around. I think this is common in most European hotels as well. However the location is excellent. It is about a few feet from two subway stations and bang in the middle of the happening part of NYC. The room we got was the corner most room on the second level and at the street side. We could hear people talking all night on the street. It took me an hour to fall asleep,it was so noisy!!! The staff is very uptight and not friendly. We did try the bar and the restaurant food and it was excellent.That said I may stay here again due to the location but wouldnt pay more than 100$ for this hotel(which is what we did this time)."
53,1749,"Dec 14 2008 	This place was in a prime location and although small was a great place to stay!	Not sure what the last two reviews are talking about. This place is right on 50th and in the heart of midtown Manhattan in walking distance to every main attraction you could want. It is one block away from the top portion of Times Square. The place is very small with a nice bar and restaurant off he lobby. The staff was friendly and accomodating. The rooms are plain and small but did the trick (you dont stay too long in the room anyway, so why the complaints?). The rooms were clean and neat. The beds look close to the floor but were comfortable. The decor was trying to be boutique but wasn't there. The only complain I would have about this place is that in some parts it looked under construction and the elevators are horrible. They are old and slow and do not come all the time to your floor. The value of this place for the spot, is unreal. Ihad no issues and the price was right for this expensive city. Give this place a try, you wll ot be sorry. Take it from someone who has stayed at many places in NYC."
54,1749,"Dec 3 2008 	Dump!	Do not be fooled by this hotels website, this hotel is very old fashioned, dirty and falling apart which is such a shame as it is in a great location."
55,1749,"Nov 19 2008	Great Location - however miserable staff and a cold and shabby room.	We spent a long weekend in New York and so wanted to be as central as possible. You dont get more central than Amsterdam Court. When i read the reviews, i was expecting a tiny room but ours was huge. Problem being that it was overlooking the main street which was very noisy. The room was chilly and could have done with a few repairs and the shower certainly wasnt hot. Huge and comfortable bed, however, so the hours of walking were worth it at bed-time! The staff were quite moody and didnt once check that we were ok, that we had all the info we needed or even say thank you after we paid and checked out - that was very disappointing. All in all we had a fab time in New York and Amsterdam Court is a great location to base yourself from. They just need to cheer the place up a bit (including the staff!)."
56,1749,"Nov 14 2008 	Perfect location	After spending hours looking on the web for a &quot;reasonably priced&quot; hotel, I gave up and handed it over to our travel agent. That said, just spent 3 nights at Amsterdam Court Hotel, and although not cheap by our Canadian standards, I'd go back. Breakfast is not included, but there is a Continental breakfast available for $10 per person. We did not choose this as we brunched somewhere on our daily travels. There did appear to be pastries, croissants, bagels, boiled eggs, fruit and yogourt. I don't recall if there was also cereal. Plus side: great location on 50th. Broadway is just around the corner, Times Square a 15 minute walk, Central Park,Grand Central and Empire State Building about 40 minutes, Moma, 10, Met, Guggenheim and Nat. History museum less than an hour. There are plenty of food options within a 10 minute walk, including a grocery store which is well stocked. We didn't have time for theatre, and were not shopping, but this is a central spot for both. Room 723 was clean, staff friendly, 24 hour coffee, cappucino, tea available. This, in particular, was appreciated first thing in the morning. Not so plus...small bathroom with very fluctuating water temp in shower. The toilet is on an angle ( sadistic architect or plumber) and so when sitting sideways, as is necessary, the hot water pipe is very close to the right knee. This bathroom would not be recommended for anyone on the plus side of weight and size. The concierge called a car to take us to the airport- $45 flat rate, same price as a not so clean yellow taxi. I had read reviews before going, so did have some idea of what to expect - a clean room for a good night's sleep in a safe, vibrant area."
57,1749,"Nov 8 2008 	Fabulous grily weekend hotel !!	My sister and I stayed here for my 40th Birthday weekend. They upgraded us because we booked direct and although the room was basic, it was spacious, clean and modern and in our opinion excellent value.The location is perfect for shopping and sight seeing, Broadway is literally at the end of the road and 5th Avenue shops are 2 blocks walking distance.We found the staff to be extremely helpful and the little sushi / Teryaki bar next door serves fabulous food.If you're looking for a hotel which is modern and clean , in a 'convenient for theatre and shopping' location and at a very reasonable price, then give this a go, we will definitely be returning in the not too distant future. Many thanks !!"
58,1749,"Oct 26 2008 	Excellent Location Good price and very good attention	I recently went to to New York for the first time with my wife and after looking at several alternatives at the web by diferent engines found Amsterdam Court Hotel.The hotel has a privileged location, very safe area,. just in the middle of Broadway, at walking distance from theaters, restaurants, shops, subway stations, you name it... It's also very price competitive for a New York hotel.Rooms are a bit small but very clean, and everyday we came back to the hotel it was nicely arranged and prepared. Probably for us one of the most important things was the nice attention that we received from all its personnel. There was allways someone at the desk willing to explain and recommend places to go and visit. Thank you Liza for all your recommendations!!The hotel is one corner away from Food Emporium, excellent place to grab somthing to eat, from breakfast to full meal at very good prices, it is also convinient because you have a pick-up point on the same street to take a City Tour hop-in bus.I would defenitvely stay at the Amsterdam Court next time that I visit New York.... hopefully, next year."
59,1749,"Oct 24 2008 	Loved NY but......	Myself and a friend stayed at this hotel for four nights. The location is brilliant and there's a great Irish pub next door but one. The hotel is clean and with the exception of the first person we encountered on the desk all the staff were very nice. We had booked a twin room before our arrival and knowing that twins are at a premium in NY double checked before we left home. When we arrived at the hotel we found we had been booked into a double. We were finally given what passed for a twin room but. there was no window in the room and until we went to the front door of the hotel had no idea of what type of clothing might be required (it rained most of the time). There was only a single robe for hanging space and a couple of small drawers and each time the bathroom door was opened it banged into the wash basin. All in all we had a great time in NY, the people are brill.Although this hotel has a marvellous location, I wouldn't want to stay there on my next visit."
60,1749,"Oct 11 2008 	Great Experience	We arrived early in the morning and of course our room wasn't ready so, we handed our bags to the luggage hold (free of charge) and headed out for a stroll around central park( 3 blocks away) and had lunch. When we got back our room was ready...very clean and spacious for what I was expecting and beautiful decor! The staff was excellent...especially Liza!!! We stayed for 4 nights and have absolutely nothing to complain about! We will be back for sure!!"
61,1749,"Oct 2 2008 	The Perfect Downtown Location	If youre staying 3 or 4 nights in Manhattan, this is the perfect location. The hotel is clean and comfortable. There is free coffee in the breakfast room and an Internet terminal (pay-as-you-go) in the Lobby. Its a few steps to Broadway and a short distance from Times Square and also the Rockefeller Center. The CitySights NY hop-on tour buses stop just around the corner. Theres an Irish Pub, Sandwich Bar and Deli nearby (in addition to the hotel bar &amp; restaurant).Like most, older hotels, the rooms are small, but unless you have huge amounts of luggage this should not be a problem. Our room was on the 7th. floor and was very quiet (we turned the a/c down low at night) and the room layout is very space efficient. The rooms are modern and are obviously regularly renovated, so we had no complaints there.A final plus is the Subway station just a few yards from the hotel, where you can take the E-Train to Jamaica (Sulphin Blvd) and connect with the Air-Train for JFK Airport. Its the fastest (and cheapest) way to JFK (using a Metro card with $7 value).We would definitely recommend this hotel as a perfect base for NY sightseeing."
62,1749,Sep 29 2008 	Don't stay here!	We reserved and pre-paid for 2 non-smoking rooms. When we arrived we were told they only had smoking rooms available-even though we pre-paid for non-smoking rooms. The rooms were so small we couldn't even open the door completely and they reeked of cigarette smoke. One of the rooms had water pouring from the bathroom ceiling through the light fixture. When we complained to the front desk clerk she said there was nothing she could do. We moved to another hotel. The web site picture are very misleading and the hotel personnel service is very poor.
63,1749,"Jul 30 2008 	Nice clean and convenient	We booked this back in February and the reviews seemed good then. The rooms are small, but if you know that going in, you shouldn't have a problem. The staff at the Amsterdam Court were awesome, someone was always at the front desk and always willing to give directions and subway help. We enjoyed our stay very much. The only bad thing I can think of was the air conditioner, it was a little on the noisy side. Al in all we enjoyed our stay at the Amsterdam Court."
64,1749,"Jul 21 2008 	Great for the Money!	Bargain for NYC. This hotel had a very European flare; small rooms but knew what to expect from reading these reviews. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked great; in fact at times it was pretty down right cold...which I love! The only problem I had were the feather pillows, as my daughter and I are allergic to them. We asked the staff for different pillows; but that was all they had. We &quot;made do&quot; by putting bath towels over them. Nice and friendly staff. Whenever we needed anything, the staff was quick to accomodate. Very convenient to Times Square and there is a great deli two blocks to the right in which we had breakfast every morning. Would stay there again."
65,1749,"Jul 16 2008 	Very Disappointing	We have just returned from a three week holiday touring round America, we stayed in several hotels and this was by far the worst. The room was very very small, decor was dark and drab, the bed was a double not a kingsize, however the bedlinen and towels were changed daily, and the location of the hotel was good."
66,1749,"Jul 8 2008 	Great hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my son for his 21st birthday. It was a recommendation from the booking agent. We found the hotel room to be small but clean. The staff were very friendly and polite to us and we really enjoyed our stay. There's a good bar in the lobby which we would highly recommend. The location is just right. This is my 3rd time in New York and overall, it was good value for money and I would certainly recommend this hotel for a short stay."
67,1749,"Jul 7 2008 	Nice Hotel - Great Location	Just returned home from three nights at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. The room was nice. Queen bed with small desk and chair. It wasn't large, but spacious for NY standards. It was clean and had a warm feeling with its decor. The bathroom was also clean and had a hair dryer and spa products.Upon check-in, the staff was helpful and although arriving early (noon) our room was ready. This was a very pleasant surprise after a morning of traveling.The Amsterdam Court had an excellent location. Right off 50th between two subway stations (red and blue), and near many restaurants, the Gershwin Theatre (Wicked), and a pharmacy. My favorite, however, was the Food Emporium down the street and around the corner. It was perfect for a quick breakfast or for picking up snacks.When I return to NY there is no question that I will stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel."
68,1749,"Jul 7 2008 	Does the job	My wife and I booked the hotel through opodo.com for a five day trip to NYC just before christmas 2007. After reading some reviews on this site and others, we were a little apprehensive. Descriptions of dirt/bugs etc are a little off putting.When we arrived we got checked in and shown to our room within five minutes or so.yes the room was on the small side but no worse than you would expect in a city where space is at a premium.There was avery comfortable double bed, cable tv, toilet and bath/shower. There was also ample wardrobe space for all the big winter jackets!!The room was cleaned and turned down every day. We had no complaints.The hotel offers abuffet style breakfast which we only bothered with one morning - fruit, croissant, cereal and coffee, all very nice.As for dining, the hotel does not have its on restaurant but there is an oriental diner adjoined. We gave it a miss but only as it is not our thing.The hotel staff were all extremely helpful and friendlyin a number of languages. one girls (forget her name) even offered to take us to the bronx to yankee stadium as we were unsure about going on the subway!Sorry i have no photos of the hotel but honestly, for a short stay it is well priced, well situated - 226 West 50th Street- just off times square, and worth a shot"
69,1749,"Jul 3 2008 	Great Value	We stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for two nights. Expected the rooms to be small, which they were, so was not suprised. But the hotel was clean, close to everything and had very helpful staff. For the price of the stay, I was very impressed with the overall experience. Next time we are in NY, we will be booking at the Amsterdam again."
70,1749,"Jul 2 2008	Good Value (for NYC)	For the single traveler or couple who want value over fluff, this place is just fine. Small rooms, but clean, and a good location at 50th and Broadway, a five short block walk to Times Square. Most of the hotels I checked were over $300/nite. I found this one on Sidestep and paid about $220. I'd stay there again."
71,1749,"Jul 1 2008 	Postage Stamp	This room was so small that we had to take turns entering it, close the door, then other one could enter. There was an ironing board and iron, but I couldn't figure out any space in the room to put it, unless it was on top of the bed. Speaking of the bed, it was NOT a king size as we reserved, and it was the hardest bed I have ever slept on! For the price we paid ($300) I would have expected a little more. We have been to NYC several times and this was the most expensive and smallest room we have ever stayed in."
72,1749,"Jun 11 2008 	Loved the Amsterdam Court	We stayed for 8 nights in the Amsterdam Court Hotel. Because a lot of reviews mentioned that the rooms were small, we asked for a large room. Room 717 was large enough. The room &amp; bathroom were clean and well furnished. The hotel has a good location. Next door is an Irish pub.The staff is friendly and helpfull. The underground is 50 m. from the hotel. Times Square, Central Park and Radio City Music Hall are at app. 10 min.The Amsterdam Court is located on Broadway. There are a lot of theatres in the surroundings of the hotel.We can recommend this hotel to everyone!"
73,1749,"Jun 2 2008 	Great Location small but clean rooms	We stayed 5 days in Amsterdam Court in May 2008. The location is great! Broadway around the corner and Times Square very nearby. We arrived in the evening at Amsterdam Court. At first we were dissappointed about our Room. It was clean but very small; old fashioned dark colors; not a very nice view at the back of the Hotel. That changed a bit when we saw the bathroom. Rather big and very clean. We slept very well because the Bed was very good. We had a nice time in New York, because we didn't stay much in our small Room. Amsterdam Court is maybe not the nicest and cheapest Hotel, but I can recommend it as a good place to stay when you want to visit Manhattan."
74,1749,May 29 2008	Great until we got home	I must say that the hotel itself was all we could have asked for considering what we paid. The staff were friendly enough and the rooms cleaned everyday and towels changed daily also. It made our first stay in NY a pleaseure. Due to its situation in the centre of Manhatten we also were planning on going back again and had infact recomended it to people on our return.Fast Forward 2 weeks.....................................I have recieved a charge on my credit card for over 700 from the hotel. We did not use any room service or make any phonecalls so being the trip was already paid for this certainly alarmed me.When I got through to one of the guys on reception although he seemed to be helpful and explained that when you book in they take a charge from your account to cover any costs then refund it once you have checked out this was NOT explained when we happily handed our cards over. I do understand the format but am more angry that I have had to spend time contacting to a cost of my own for thier error. The guy said he would check this out and is sure the refund would go ahead but said he was unable to ring me bck to confirm but I could ring him if I wanted...Gee Thanks. I am now waiting for the refund which I am sure is ligit but it really leaves a sour taste in your mouth when a place like this who say they strive for excellent customer service cant even manage a call back for something they have messed up on. Have a good day ya'll.
75,1749,"May 17 2008 	Brilliant	We stayed for 3 nights on our honeymoon. Ok, the rooms aren't the biggest but why do you need a big room? The only time we spent in the room was to sleep and drop off yet more bags of shopping. The location of this hotel is absolutely fantastic. Out the door turn right and your on broadway. 5 minutes down Broadway and your at Times Square. Central Park, Empire State, 5th Ave, Rockerfeller Plaza are all a short walk away. If your a bit more energetic you can even walk back from Grenwich Village, although I would advise that you don't take my Wife with you..... (not worth the ear bashing). The hotel itself is really clean and well presented with helpfull staff. Free coffee in the lobby is a bonus. I would thoroughly recommend staying here, next time I go to New York I'll stay again."
76,1749,"Apr 23 2008 	Not the worst but definitely look elsewhere!	Ok, let me first say that I read countless reviews on these sites, and 90% of the time all the negative reviews I read are inaccurate. I find most problems people report about, they probably bring on themselves. And I find that if you are decent, nice individual then your experience is pleasant.With that being said, there are many, MANY better hotels in New York than this one. Rooms are very very small. I've stayed in over 10 hotels in NYC, and these are way smaller than average. We had 2 beds, and not much else in our room. It's hard to put into words how small the rooms actually are - especially for 2 people. Comfortable beds though. The staff was ok. Much nicer than most people have been writing about, but they seemed very uncaring for the most part. The window in our room wouldn't lock, so people from other rooms could gain access unattested via the fire escape. However, the front desk staff couldn't care less. The location is amazing, obviously - half a block in from Times Square. To sum up, there are much better hotels out there. Paying anything more than $175/day for this hotel is way too much. I would look elsewhere before considering this hotel. If this is a last resort, it's not the worst option. But as said, look elsewhere before looking into this hotel."
77,1749,Apr 23 2008	Nice clean for new york reasonable priced	After reading the reviews here I was a little bit scared but it was allright. Small room but clean and where do you need a large room for? You`re supposed to be in the city not on you`re room. Sleeping is ok but we were there in spring and the room was already hot. I think when you are going there in summer you might check a hotel with a good airco.
78,1749,Apr 20 2008 	Great value	I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. Nice trendy decor in a great location. rooms were very small (that's NY) but cute and clean.
79,1749,"Mar 22 2008 	Impressed	After missing out on booking the Salisbury Hotel, I booked the Amsterdam Court Hotel. and what a great choice i made.Arrived on the Friday to be greated by Robert the doorman, checked in at reception, the reception area looked clean and the staff really helpful, giving us information leaflets and the map i took everywhere with me hahaWe had room 717, Robert taking our suitcases up, I must admit after reading some reviews I was expecting a really small room, but was really pleased with our room, a double bed with a lot of room at each side to get out of bed, with a wardrobe at each side with hangers on one side and enough room for clothes, an ironing board and iron inside, and room on top for the suitcases, phone at one side of bed and alram/radio/cd clock at other side with light switch for 2 spotlights above bed. and a plug socket next to switch, tv on a side unit with a chair in front, a mirror behind front door with a shelf, and bathroom, 2 windows, one looking onto 50th street and other was side of next building, it was like an office block across the road but look sideways onto 7th Ave and you could see the Mama mia sign all lit up from Winter Garden TheatreThe bed was comfy with enough pillows and a cushion, bedding was changed every 2 days, bathroom was only enough room for one to get ready but that wasn't a problem, bath with shower, spray head was a bit funny, (but im yet to find a decent showerhead abroad) water was hot, hairdryer worked, a new soap bar everyday, bath towels, hand towels and face cloths all changed everyday, only downside was toilet not very well positioned, my bf's knees near enough touched the door when sitting down. Tv was in working order and the heating was just right not too hot and not cold. a wee bit of noise from radiator. noise from street wasn't that bad, and never kept me awake.room 717 is at the end of the corridor so no one walking past room, and only heard people one morning leaving there room. 2 lifts to choose from and we didnt need to wait long for lift. Was really a clean hotel overall.a great location with the Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Cathedral on same street, Times Square nearby and great deli not far to have breackfast.on a review i read before i went it said there is a sex shop a few doors down, but these are all over NY when walking about, but no one is dragging you in so i didn't have a problem with that.so will be staying at the Amsterdam court hotel next time im in New York"
80,1749,"Mar 21 2008 	Location is it's saving grace	There are lots of little things about this hotel which disappointed me. Firstly, on arrival the receptionists were less than helpful. We then discovered after getting to our room (in the VERY creaky lift) that there was little space to store suitcases and clothes. The wardrobe looked like it was about to fall apart! We were constantly tripping over our suitcases in the middle of the night! The main problem was the unbearable heat in the room - thank goodness there was also air-con, but unfortunately this was too noisy to have on all night. Obviously it is going to be noisy in NY, but the noise from other rooms and from the old heaters was awful - if you are a light sleeper take ear plugs!The room was clean however, and the bathroom was a decent size, with a good shower and loads of soft towels.The greatest asset really is the location - 5 minutes from Times Square! My advice would be: if you've already booked this hotel, buy some ear plugs and a fan. If you haven't booked, look elsewhere - there are better hotels for the same price."
81,1749,"Mar 14 2008 	Terrible hotel	The location was great as well as the service from the bell hop. The rest was very below average. The room was SO small you could almost touch both sides with your hands. Only 1/2 of the room was lit. The desk and closet area had no lights. The closet was 8 ft tall and could not be reached to hang our clothes and we are 5'4&quot; There was at one time damage to the floor. The repair was poorly done and we constantly had to watch where we were stepping. The electrical plugs were in poor condition. Several of our items wouldn't stay connected. The other plug was loose, behind a long curtain and already had 5 items plugged in it with a cheap adapter. The room was a sauna. We tried to turn the heat off but the knob was too hot to handle. The heater made noises all night long. We had to turn on the air conditioner but that really never worked either. It also competed with the heater in who could make the loudest noise. The view was unbelievable. A brick wall 3 ft out the window. The bathroom had broken and missing tiles. There was an exposed heat pipe that we kept burning our hands on because it was where we thought the light switch should have been. Anyone taller would have burnt their knees while sitting on the toilet. Too close. The so called shower head was terrible and the temperature of the water never stayed the same. One minute I was freezing the next scoulding water. The check in area looked worn and the staff was not overly friendly. The front door attendant never was ther. Spent his time at the front dest chatting. If I hadn't pre-paid for my visit we would have left immediately. I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN and you should not either."
82,1749,"Feb 27 2008 	horrible amsterdam court	Horrible horrible place. Not as clean and friendly as described. The windows are cracked, the toilets are overflowing constantly, and the staff are disgustingly rude. They lost our safe deposit key, gave us the wrong one and refused to accept liability for our passports adnd money being missing! Although good location, and seems like a bargain, save yourself the trouble before they rob you too! Never going back there again"
83,1749,Feb 19 2008 	Great HotelGreat LocationGreat Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I was a lil bit scared to go to this hotel after reading some of the review on here. But as soon as I set foot in the door my fears went away. Everyone was very helpful and nice. My room was bigger than I expected to be. There was plenty of room to walk around and the bathroom had plenty of space also. There wasn't much of a view from the windows but who goes to NYC to sit in their hotel room and look out the window. I went into the city to see Wicked and this hotel is the perfect spot to stay. It's right across the street. I literally left my room at 7:55pm and easily made it to the 8:00pm show. It's only a 1 minute walk. LOL Times Sqaure is about a 5 or 10 minute walk also. I will Defininately be staying here again.
84,1749,"Feb 8 2008	Short but great stay!	I'm just back after a 5 night stay in this hotel, and was very pleased overall with everything.The loaction is excellent, we only had to use the subway once and wasn't even in a taxi as everything is so close by!The room wasn't overly big but plenty of room for my boyfriend and i and our 2 suitcases! There was a built-in wardrobe and a chest of drawers for storage. The room light was a little dim, but 3 extra lamps and the bathroom was bright enough for getting ready!The room was cleaned, bed made and towels changed every day and i think the sheets on the bed were changed at least twice during our stay! There was a full size ironing board and iron in the room which i thought was great and also a hairdyer in the bathroom.The stairwells and lift were always clean as was the hotel receptiona and lonuge areas. The staff were friendly and helpful, they arranged out shuttle bus back to the airport and kept our bags until we were ready to leave.I would definitely recommend this hotel."
85,1749,"Jan 27 2008 	worst hotel ever!	Back in september 2007 myself and my freind book a room with two beds. It was our first time new york city we where strangers in a huge city. The clerk was less then helpful kept answering the hotel phone trying to get rid of us he was useless. We made the booking months in advance and rang the hotel four times to confirm our booking. Yet he was very rude had no customer service skills at all. He even tryed to get us to stay in a room so tiny even an ant would have problems trying to move around. I am told that it is customery to tip in new york! Here is one for the general manager sack the night clerk. Our hoilday was nearly destory by this by this man. polightness cost you nothing, I have tryed very hard to be polight when i wrote this review. Please if you go to New york city you should avoid this hotel as it is awful."
86,1749,"Jan 25 2008 	Great Location - all else average	Tiny room, hotel was quite dimly lit, although the staff were helpful. Location was fab very central."
87,1749,"Jan 24 2008 	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in my entire life !!!!	I stayed here for 3 days at around $275/day while attending a conference in NY. Couldn't sleep all night because of all the noise coming from outside. The hotel is next door to a strip joint. The room I stayed in was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed before. It was so small that I was not even able to open the bathroom door completely (photos are attached). After tossing and turning for 6 hours, I reached the front desk at 4am. The staff was rude like never seen before. I requested to change my room for the next 2 nights and they told me that the other rooms are smaller than the one I currently have !!!. Do yourself a favor - rather stay in a motel in NJ than stay at the Amsertdam."
88,1749,Jan 14 2008 	good location near times sq	excellent location and easy to get to. Staff helpful and polite. Hotel decor in need of tiding. We had no extract fan in the ensuite so the room was a little stale smelling.
89,1749,"Jan 13 2008	I recommend this hotel!	It was a great find among the many similar-rating hotels in New York Manhattan (even with less convenient location). Hotel rates were, compared to many similar ranking hotels in Midtown area, relatively cheap. Visiting from Hong Kong where everywhere is crowded with people and bombarded with noise --- I come here to Amsterdam Court Hotel and find the room to be quite spacious and quiet in the hotel area (except the lobby where there was a Japanese restuarant with live music at night); contrary to what other reviews said about the hotel. ALSO, the location was great with 2 different subway lines on 8th and Broadway (W51St. near Rockefeller Center and Times Square --- i.e. all MAJOR AREAS!)However, it would be really great if room includes breakfast as it is quite expensive eating out 3 times a day. Despite there were no breakfast servings, I definitely recommend this hotel to all of you!"
90,1749,"Jan 7 2008 	Great location great hotel	This hotel was really a great find, it is in a great location, is good value and very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. If i was going to New York again i would definately stay here again."
91,1749,"Jan 3 2008 	Great Value 	This hotel is not the most posh location in NYC, but it is clean, simple &amp; affordable! We were visiting NYC for a long weekend right before Thanksgiving, and I struggled to find an affordable hotel that I would feel safe/comfortable staying in. Amsterdam Court's rooms were small -- but that is a given in NYC. Our room was well-kept and the bathroom was very clean. The staff was friendly and was extremely helpful with storing our luggage and assisting us with airport transportation. The location is incredible - right in the Heart of Times Square. You are within a block of two Subway lines, and it is very, very easy to get anywhere in mid-town. There is a great little coffee shop two doorfronts down where we grabbed a coffee and bagel each morning on the way to the subway. For as centrally located as it is, the rooms were very quiet. I was actually a little surprised at how quiet they were. The hotel isn't excellent, but it is excellent for the price. A great find for NYC."
92,1749,"Jan 1 2008	Nice little find for a great price.	My mom and I stayed here for two nights during the 2007 holiday season. For those who complain about this hotel being too small or the noise, may I kindly remind you this is New York City and a) unless you want to shell out $1000 a night, all rooms will be small and b) unless you want to stay somewhere other than Manhattan, all hotels will be surrounded by noise.This hotel was great. They let us check in early with no extra fee. The rooms were clean and the front desk service was spectacular. They went above and beyond to keep us happy. We asked for no maid service and they left us clean towels in a laundry bag hanging from our door anyway, so we didn't have to make a request. While I travel to Manhattan about once a month and know my way around very well, the bell hop was very helpful and always offered to give us directions or get us transportation. On our last day, they locked up our luggage after check out without charging us an additional fee (as many Manhattan hotels will), as we weren't leaving until the evening and check out was at noon. The room was a bit stuffy, but nothing that wasn't fixed by running the fan in the air conditioner for a bit. Water pressure (one of my big &quot;things&quot;) was excellent. The elevators ran fine for us, but I also take the stairs instead when I can.The hotel is located near lots of good touristy things - Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, theatres, Port Authority, Penn Station, Macy's (though some would argue with me that the walk to Penn Station or Macy's is lengthy), and Central Park are all within walking distance. Plus, the hotel is just off some great subway lines, and situated between 8th Avenue, Broadway, and 7th Avenue, so catching a bus or cab is relatively easy.I am a well-seasoned world traveler and I would definitely stay in this hotel again. What a nice little find at a great price."
93,1749,"Dec 25 2007 	Very very tiny room but ideal location and price	I booked a $144 room rate at the Amsterdam Court on Expedia about three weeks before traveling over Christmas weekend. Not bad at all for a room in such an ideal location in the center of Midtown/Times Square.I booked a deluxe Queen but did not end up in that type of room. I arrived earlier than the 3pm check in and the offer was for a room of lesser size. It contained a double bed. Bathroom was very adequate. There was no space in the room for anything more than the bed. It was the smallest room I have ever had in NYC. I suspect the hotel doesn't normally rent these rooms except for 'overflow.' I made the decision not to ask to move, but the desk clerk also never disclosed she was 'downgrading' me from the type of room I purchased.I had stayed at this hotel before and would stay there again. I just wanted to give full disclosure to what happened so other travelers are aware. All in all, a perfectly acceptable situation for me as a solo travelver with a lot of time spent outside the hotel."
94,1749,"Dec 22 2007 	Hmmmm....	My partner and I reserved a room at this hotel because it was quite reasonable and in a good location for our first time in NY. Don't be misguided by the photos on-line. The lobby may be the nicest area of the hotel but even then if you look closely, you can count the layers of paint slapped on. Our clerk was wearing a wrinkled white shirt and looked like he belonged to the mob. During check-in he asked if we wanted to &quot;cut a deal&quot;. Rather than paying the rate we were initially quoted, he offered to drop the price by half and then wanted a cut. I was ready to turn around and walk out. When we got to our room, it was tiny, dark and dingy. When we used the shower, the pipes in the walls rattled the entire time. All in all, the best part of this hotel is it's location in Time Square but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'd be embarrassed to admit I stayed there."
95,1749,"Dec 17 2007 	Great Location 	My partner and I stayed at ACH in August / September 2006. We booked it online and paid just under $200AUD per night for our stay. For NYC, we thought the price was excellent, considering the location of the hotel. We were very impressed when we first arrived, we were met at the front door and by their friendly and helpful staff who assisted us with our luggage. The front entrance to the hotel was being refurbished while we were there, but we didn't hear any noises from it. The only noises we heard were the usual hussle and bussle noises of New York City (honking horns and sirens)!Our room was great, we overlooked 50th Street and could see Broadway (heading towards Central Park). The room had plenty of space - we easily fit 2 large suitcases, and still had room to walk around. Bathroom was a good size. We had a problem with toilet while we were there, and it was fixed within half an hour of us notifying reception. Staff were always friendly and courteous and willing to help us when we needed to know something.There is a common room next to the reception area, with internet facilities (and printer) and free tea and coffee. As there were no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms, it was good to come down to the common room and relax on the lounges.This hotel is very close to Times Square, only a 5 minute walk and also close to Central Park and other major attractions. We walked most places around the hotel and caught the subway when we wanted to go downtown - station was very close. Being such a centrally located hotel, we could stay out in NYC until all hours and have no troubles getting back into the hotel. We didn't have any food at the hotel - there are plenty of places to eat nearby so we chose to do that instead.We have recommended our family and friends stay at ACH. We would definately look at this hotel on our next trip to NYC!"
96,1749,"Dec 11 2007 	Not bad at all actually quite pleasant!	Stayed at the Amsterdam Court Hotel for 5 nights in November. I travelled as one in a party of five people.I have actually stayed at the Amsterdam Court hotel three years previously and thought that for the price it was a pretty good deal, so when I saw the the hotel was reasonably priced again I booked again for the whole family.We had three people in one room, the room was a decent size with a fold up bed placed in the room (this was not a childs bed and was suitable for someone 6ft tall!), the room was clean, large with large TV. This room was at the front of the building, so the only downfall of the room was the noise.Two people shared the other room, which was also very clean, with a nice bathroom.Both rooms were cleaned daily.Staff were very helpful at all times, dealing with luggage, check in took less than five minutes, booking transportation to the airport etc.Free tea and coffee was also available.The hotel is in an excellent location for all the general tourist attractions, Times Square, theatres, Top of the Rock, Central Park, museums ..... the hotel is ideally located to travel all across the city.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice, pleasant hotel in an excellent location."
97,1749,"Nov 18 2007	Location great - Service is SH	Ok - it was a great location. It was an ok boutique hotel at first glance. I understand that hotels are smaller in NYC than most. I called for a rollaway. Took them forever and when I layed down, I realized that the bed was WET. The sheets and crap of a blanket they gave me were actually wet. He brought one pair of thin clean sheets. (I have had better linens in a Motel 6) And chucked how it rained a few days ago. Great. My bed has been molding. Then they presented something as a continental breakfast - the usual - dry bagels, eh fruit, cheap cereal and yogurt that had been sitting out all morning, not on ice. They had a very small sign that said $12.95 and because my mother didn't have her reading glasses, didn't realize it and had to pay that much for a stale bagel with generic cream cheese. When we got back to the hotel after the show, I asked if they had any bottled water for drinking and the guy behind the counter looked at me like I was from Mars and the concierge actually told me to &quot;drink from the faucet.&quot; Just a really bad experience - not to mention either rude or incompetent help. Just not what I expected from a cute boutique hotel for $350 per night. That's just incredibly pathetic in my book. We don't treat people like that in California."
98,1749,"Nov 12 2007 	The Wonderful Amsterdam Court NY NY!	I stayed here with both my sisters and I couldn't reccomend it more! Firstly, the staff could not be more helpful and polite. We needed to use the storage facility as we were visiting family for a couple of days and returning to the hotel, and for a charge of $20 for the entire time and for as many cases, we were happy and trusted them with our belongings. Not only that, the hotel was exactly what we needed. The twin rooms aren't enormous, but plenty big enough! The rooms with one double bed in are a decent size. The bathroom is spotless.You get free tea and coffee The biggest bonus of all is that you are soooo near where it all happens! On Broadway!!!! You literally walk to the end of the street, turn right and you are on broadway! Another plus is that the hotel is on Gershwin Way which is the same road as the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is on show! We all had a wonderful stay here and everyone was sooooooo helpful! I have already booked to go back in January and have reccomended it to a friend (who is very fussy) and they are going next week!"
99,1749,"Nov 9 2007 	Do Not Stay Here!!!!!!	My business colleagues and I stayed here for a week as it was one of the more reasonably priced hotels the week of the NYC Marathon and we all had horrible experiences. The hotel is old, we didnt have working water, locks were broken on doors, and the 1 person they had working was incompetent. There was no bellman to help with bags or with getting cabs. I would advise to spend more money and stay elsewhere!"
100,1749,"Nov 8 2007 	terrible customer service and i wasn't even there!!	I went to the Amsterdam Court Hotel website to make my reservation. Everything was great - I was able to select the dates for my reservation and the room I wanted. I could easily pay for the booking online as well. When I tried to cancel my reservation a day later, I come to find that they don't even have me booked for a room in their system!!! I called 2x and spoke with 2 different people and both couldn't find anything....even though I had my Confirmation #. What the ____ is up with that?! If I had gone to the hotel when I wanted to I wouldn't even have had anywhere to stay. TERRIBLE service from the beginning, and I wasn't even there!"
101,1749,"Oct 29 2007 	Filthy Fungal And Invested Hell Hole.	We arrived after a very, very long journey from England to the Amsterdam Court Hotel. I warn you now, do not be impressed by the fancy lobby and beware of the dragon behind the reception desk!!! We checked in after the Dragon looked over are papers and demanded to see my credit card. I immediately questioned her and said that i had paid for everything; she said they needed it simply for things such as the telephone if we used it or breakfast. (Fat chance, $9.95.00 for croissant and coffee! I recommend the Belly Delly for breakfast, it's truly wonderful!). After copying my number she handed it back and we made are way to the elevator that looked as though it dated back to the 1920's. It took ten minutes just to get to wait for the damn thing and get to our room which was on the second floor. When the elevator doors opened we were greeted by the smell of cigarette smoke. The room was simply disgusting, it smelled, there were damp patches all over the cieling, mould growing, cracked floors, cigarette burns, dirty bed linen and to my horror my son later found a Fungus growing behind a wonky radiator. We had to stay a night in this disgusting room but it felt like ten!!! Later on we discovered that they had deducted fifty dollars from my account without informing me. I canceled my card and i questioned them on this in which they replied that they took the money as an account for extra room services. I demanded to see the manager; however, this manager only works four hours a day... The Dragon, who we later named Cruella Devil finally agreed to move us after a lot of arguing. We were moved to the fourth floor. This room was better; however still dark, dingy and the same odd smell. The AC was loud and didn't cool the room; it seemed to blow out hot air. The bathroom was dirty and smelled. Also, the noise was terrible, people at night continually slamming doors, car horns and sirens something that we were guaranteed would not trouble us. The hotel was seedy, dark and simply disgusting with a strip club next door! My tips are as follows:1) Watch out for Cruella Devil.2) If you choose to stay in this place, look out for mice and traps.3) DON'T GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
102,1749,"Oct 18 2007 	Prison has bigger rooms and better showers.	Just got back from a memorable stay at the Amsterdam Court.At first glance this hotel looks ok but don't be fooled by the lobby and sushi restaurant/bar. It's all a facade. The rooms are windowless cells, the sushi sucks and its right next door to strip club.My first cell or &quot;standard room&quot; was about a foot wider than a full size bed. No closet or furniture other than a small armoir and one window blocked by a loud AC. I found trash on the armoir left from the previous occupant's dinner and my proximity to the hotel bar made it unbearably loud. Did I mention it also smelled like paint?After complaining about the trash, the smell and the noise I upgraded to a queen room which was slightly bigger but I wouldn't call it comfortable. No real desk or furniture and a really tiny window in the corner. Only outlet I could find for my laptop was in the bathroom. But what really topped off my stay was the shower which came in two temperatures, scalding hot and freezing cold. I opted for the scalding hot which not only left me with one less layer of skin but also set off the smoke detector as there was no vent in the bathroom.All this for a mere $450. What a deal."
103,1749,"Oct 8 2007 	good hotel fantasic location	I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights when i visited new york, it is a good hotel, rooms are small but nicely decorated and clean with every thing you need, location is fabulous, couldnt get better, literally 1 minute walk to time square. good value."
104,1749,"Sep 23 2007 	What a jewel of a find!	The hotel is conveniently located in the theater district. Hotel rooms are ample for weekend visit with full room amenities. The hotel staff was courteous, warm and helpful. Sole drawback was lack of drawer space for clothing. While the room was somewhat small, it was sufficient for a weekend stay. We will go back...Carol from Bakersfield"
105,1749,"Sep 8 2007 	Great Deal Great Location Will Stay Again	Amsterdam Court Hotel is located almost in Times Square. The rooms are small (10x10). The bathroom was a good size. Even though the room was small there was plenty of closet space to unpack and we stored our suit cases above the bed. The bed was super comfy. The a/c unit could have been a little bit colder, I wouldn't want to stay in dead heat of the summer but while we were there it was good enough.The room was cleaned constantly, we always had fresh towels and everyone was really nice.My only small complaints would be the a/c could have been colder and 1 of the elevators broke down. However, the elevator was fixed within a few hours and there was an alternate elevator not far from it.I will stay here again and I definitely recommend staying."
106,1749,"Sep 8 2007 	Good Stay	Took my two nieces to NYC for vacation. They LOVED NYC !!! The hotel is in a very central location in TImes Square &amp; Theatre District. We went to see Wicked and only had to cross the street from the hotel to the other sidewalk, and the there was right there.ROOM - Small but clean, one double, and a fold-away bed. And the AC worked, which was important as it was summerBATHROOM - Clean, and had a windowFront Desk - Curt, but polite &amp; efficientTo all the people writing NYC hotel reviews in Trip Advisor &gt; QUIT COMPLAINING ABOUT NOISE. It's NYC, it's supposed to be noisy, with lots of hustle &amp; bustle. That's what WE LOVE ABOUT IT, even if it transfers thru to the room somewhat !!!. If you don't like this about NYC, then STAY AT HOME.QUIT COMPLAINING ABOUT SMALL SPACES OR SMALL ROOM.It's the BIG CITY with LOTS OF PEOPLE, which TAKE A LOT OF SPACE. Therefore, some spaces (like hotel rooms) are going to be smaller than what you are used to. This is partof the character of NYC. IF You don't like small spaces, then STAY AT HOME.NYC is a MARVELOUS CITY. WE LOVE IT AS IT IS !!!!!!"
107,1749,"Sep 4 2007	very bad experience - poor hotel management	we just went for NYC trip. My friend booked the hotel online for 2 rooms 2 night. They messed up the booking and only reserved 1 room for 2 night. We only found out on the day of arrival! Our schedule got totally messed up and we need to find another hotel right away and cancelled the 2nd night reservation so that 2 parties can be staying in the same hotel on the 2nd night. We ended up have to pay more expensive rate for a different hotel because we made last minute reservation.We have to argue with the front desk (OR ELSE they want to charge us cancellation fee and early check-out fee, all sorts of fees). It is their mistake and why we consumer have to bear all the consequences?! Their room was extremely small and dark too and the corridor to the room smells terribly. Their hotel sign was small and no light on it, it takes us a while to search around when we arrived at night time. The front desk people are not consistent and not professional. Different people tell you different thing. Parking your car next to the hotel is another problem. They promised we only pay $20 per day with hotel stamped. However, we ended up paying $55 something... During check-out time, we also heard they messed up another ladies' phone bill and room bill. How can this happen?? I will never ever recommend anyone to stay in this hotel."
108,1749,"Aug 20 2007	Great Room for the Price	We were a little worried about booking a hotel in NYC without knowing anything about them. We were pleasantly surprised with the Amsterdam however. I would say the best thing about this hotel is the location. We were very pleased to walk out the door, down to the corner, and have a clear view of Times Square! We had no idea we would be so close. The hotel is also very close to Radio City Music Hall and the Rockefeller Center. Great location! Anything you could need is within close proximity. As for the room, it was fairly small but I think most rooms in NYC are unless you pay quite a hefty price. The room was fairly clean however. The bed was to die for. Very comfortable. The view from our room was basically a brick wall, but at night after being out all day in the hustle and bustle I wasnt really looking to see much anyway. The worst part of the hotel is probably the very scary and old elevator that sounds like its going to fall any moment. Other than that, I cant really complain. All in all I was quite pleased for the price we paid."
109,1749,"Aug 14 2007 	would not recommend this hotel	the rooms are quite dark and depressing, and the carpet is sticky. our bathroom really stank and the whole room had a weird smell. the hotel is in a great location (near times square) and the underground is just round the corner, but this is really the only positive thing i can say about this hotel. i am sure for that budget you could find something nicer in new york."
110,1749,"Aug 6 2007	Disgraceful and misleading	This was one of the absolute worst hotel experiences of my life and this comes from someone that spends 150 nights a year in hotels! Not only was my quoted rate (I showed my itinerary upon check-in) not honored (upcharged $90 on second night of stay), the desk clerk upon check-in was disinterested and really embraced the &quot;tough-crap&quot; attitude (&quot;Hey, I can't change what the computer says!&quot;) I'm sure you are looking for in employees. The room was a disgrace, a closet really, housekeeping was poor, air conditioner never satisfactorily cooled the room (plus it was noisy and since the room was 8'x10', it hung over the bed-the only place to set my suticase was in the shower; HONESTLY) and the t.v. barely functioned. I desperately tried to move after the first night but couldn't find a vacancy. Utell should be ashamed of this hotel bearing it's corporate name. A disgrace.The photos are misleading, even the poor ones by the secret traveler make it apear better than it really was."
111,1749,Jul 17 2007 	Dull and uninspiring	We stayed for 4 nights in the Amsterdam Court Hotel earlier this month and although we didn't have any problems as such I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.The rooms were bigger than I was expecting but the brown and beige colour scheme didn't scream sophistication! The staff by and large seemed disinterested and were more interested in having a chat with each other than helping their customers.The location was great and this really is the saving grace of the hotel although there are a bunch of other hotels in the same area so I certainly wouldn't be back.
112,1749,"Jul 10 2007 	was okay but not worth the price	Hotel is in a very good location, but it's the location that you are paying for. There is no restaurant belonging privately to the hotel, the rooms are spacious enough, but the bathrooms are tiny. The room doors are unstable, they don't exactly promote your safety to say the least. Staff at reception don't seem to be bothered, and have no time for you at all. The only good thing about this hotel was the location."
113,1749,"Jun 23 2007	Shiny exterior hides older tiny rooms	My friend is programming a film festival in NYC so I'm crashing in her room as I ride on her coat tail for this trip.She was really disappointed with this place and feels its mis-represents itself (serene lobby, cool bar, chic restaurant). But the reality is the grubby carpet in the old elevator, the variable service, the tiny rooms... I have to add that the bathroom tiles were cracked and there weren't any face cloths until I asked, oh and the clothes iron needed replacing as it leaked like a sieve.But there are some pros: It's clean and has a convenient location. On Sunday we switch to another hotel 10 blocks away. Instead of paying $320 (incl tax) I'm paying $200 at the Courtyard New York on W40th St. (in June)"
114,1749,"Jun 15 2007 	Onw of the worst i hav e ever used	Room smelled of smoke, second night the bed had not been made and the dirty towels weere not removed. It is also dull, the room lighting is poor and the horrible brown colour scheme looks old a dirty. It is also very noisy. For the price it is truly terrible."
115,1749,"Jun 11 2007 	Hotel very Small but comftable	The Amsterdam Hotel is ok , (very well situated just off Times Square). But Only if you are staying in New York for no more than 4nights like us. It is no good at all if you are staying there for A week or more. You have to keep all your stuff well organised. The rooms were very tiny just enough room for your cases.We only booked this as it was last minute, The staff were very nice though always willing to help.It did'nt really matter though, as we were out most of the time sight seeing, and just wanted somewhere to crash out at the end of each day with a nice hot shower. New york its self was Amazing, People were so very friendly, The place was buzzing constantly. I Want to go back but not in january, it was minus 10 when we were there, a little too cold to get used to."
116,1749,"Jun 4 2007 	no TV drafty and fleas	I picked this hotel because it was not one of the mega-chains thinking it would provide an interesting stay, if only in the architecture of the building. And the night manager kindly upgraded my room. But the windows let in a bit of cold air - I pinned the curtains closed by pushing a chair up against the wall, and the TV cut out - at times the digital picture froze, and other times the audio cut out, and I had some little friends sleeping with me. Wasn't the New York experience I was looking for."
117,1749,"Jun 4 2007 	Hotel was better than expected	I have just returned back from New york and stayed at the Amsterdam court Hotel. I read the reviews before i went and i can honestly say the hotel was fine, Clean room, clean bathroom. Our room was a littlesmall but we have two double beds. The staff were very helpful the concierge Scott was full of handy tips and places to go. The Hotel issituated between a new trendy bar and japanese restaurant we didn't eat there but we found a fantastic deli just round the corner from the hotel where we ate everyday which was really good value for moneycalled Deli Belly. The hotel location couldn't have been any better. Round the corner isTime Square. If you are looking for some where cheap but clean and location is key i would recommend this hotel! And i didn't see any mice !!!"
118,1749,"May 13 2007 	nice hotel at a great location	Amsterdam court is a nice, clean and friendly hotel. Indeed, the rooms are small, but what do expect in the centre of nyc? The location is the main reason to stay in this hotel. Subway is a few steps away. The staff was friendly and helpful. Bathroom was clean.If you just need a place to sleep, that is clean, comfortable and well located stay here. If you want a luxury hotelroom with all facilities (tv with 1000 channels etc) pay more."
119,1749,"May 8 2007 	The pictures are deceiving	Based on the pictures on the website I expected this to be like a W Hotel, or maybe close to it. Well, you get what you pay for. It might have been like a W Hotel in Albania, or maybe Lesotho, but it wasn't nearly what I expected. It's right in the Theater District and conveniently located. There's a subway stop within a half a block. However, there's also an adult bookstore/peepshow place two doors down, but I never noticed any disreputable people hanging around. The staff was very professional and helpful.Now the bad stuff. The place is dark and tired looking. The rooms are tiny and have poor lighting. I could barely close the door when sitting on the toilet. The bathroom was tiny, too, and with a terrible caulking and tile job. It was the caliber of what you would expect in a $39 hotel in Arizona. The bed was not terribly comfortable, but maybe that's because I'm used to sleeping in a king rather than the queen which seems to be standard. Many of the tv channels didn't work, and the &quot;engineer&quot; couldn't fix it. There's no high-speed internet access. The noise was terrible. We had a street-side room, and the traffic, sirens and garbage trucks were terrible, even with us being on the 7th floor, with the air conditioner running and with earplugs. Every time a dumpster was set down by the trucks it sounded like rocket-propelled granades going off.I would not stay here again. I'm no snob when it comes to hotels, but this one wasn't comfortable. It would be worth spending a bit more, because you don't get much for $250 a night in Manhattan."
120,1749,"Apr 11 2007 	A little gem in a big city.	After reading reviews from this website before I travelled I was worried what I might find on my arrival! I stayed at the hotel for a week and was not at all disappointed, on the contrary I was thrilled. The hotel was the cleanest I have stayed in, the room was spotless, not a speck of dust to be seen, the bathroom was sparkling. The bed linen was crisp and clean each day with the mattress and pillows being extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were all very pleasant and helpful. All the other hotel guests that I spoke to were very happy with the hotel and on at least two occassions I witnessed families checking out saying that they would definately stay at the hotel again, and I would echo these sentiments whole heartedly.This is not a modern purpose built hotel located in a new shiny skyscaper. It is in an older building which adds to the unique character that the hotel provides. I have read that the rooms are on the small side, however they are around the same size as an English 3* hotel room, in London. You have to remember this is a city with limited space, where you will pay big money for a large room!The location of the hotel was perfect, very close to Times Square and within walking distance of numerous tourist attractions. The underground station is close by as are the bus routes. This was my first visit to New York, definately not my last and I will book the Amsterdam Court Hotel for my next trip. The hotel staff organised our transport back to JFK, taking the stress of this away from us and allowing us to enjoy our last few hours in New York.All that remains is for me to thank the hotel staff for making my first trip to New York, indeed America a trouble free, comfortable stay. Wirral"
121,1749,"Apr 10 2007 	Great Experience	My girlfriend and I stayed here over MLK holiday and were very pleased with this hotel. The rooms were small, but NYC isn't exactly Illinois with ample space, so that was already expected. Our room was clean and rodent free (I believe we were on the 6th floor) and the bathroom was quite large and in immaculate shpe. The staff, although quite busy were receptive and fulfilled what we needed. The best part about this establishment is LOCATION! This is the heart of NYC and is close to subways (less than half a block) all the theaters and much more! I would highly recommend this place to a couple travelling to NYC. Probably not suited for families however due to small rooms."
122,1749,"Apr 9 2007 	Too noisy to sleep and no hot water	Anyone who complains about this hotel because the rooms are small simply doesn't understand the New York City hotel market. While the rooms are hardly spacious, they are definitely on par with many finer hotels in terms of square footage. The rooms are nicely furnished and look like they've been recently updated. What the room lacked, however, made the stay practically unbearable. There was NO hot water during my entire stay (the management said they would look at the boiler...) When I say no hot water, I mean it never got far above freezing. Lukewarm would have been just fine, but it wasn't happening. The hotel is also a small property on a busy Midtown street. If you want to stay in Midtown for convenience reasons, pay up for a larger hotel that will put you far above the hustle and bustle and seal off the noise. Being just a few floors above the street subjected me to off-key drunk renditions of &quot;New York, New York&quot; from visiting frat boys/investment bankers. Just what you need the day before a job interview.No shower and no sleep. No thanks."
123,1749,"Mar 25 2007	Better Than Expected	Well after reading the review on this site, 3 months after booking, I was not looking forward to the stay. However, when we arrived we were amazed at how close to Times Square we were. The hotel itself was basic, clean and friendly. There is a bar and restaurant attached which were really nice. The staff were really helpful. The concierge kept our bags on the day of departure for 6 hours and then arranged our transport to the airport. The maids left our room spotless and folded our clothes that we left on the bed for us by our pillows. They even remebered what side we slep on, nice touch. By the way just so you all know, the beds are not small, I could starfish easliy, which makes a change in a hotel room.The rooms are kitted out with air con and heating, and once you get the hang of both, everything is fine, neither too cold or hot. I would recommend this hotel if you are not looking for anything special but want an amazing location, close to the heart of the city. No mice, no dirt, no problems at all. Hope you enjoy it as much.Best bit - LocationWorst bit - 2 1/2 hour journey back to the airport (but we still caught our plane with 30 mins to go)"
124,1749,"Mar 7 2007 	Great Location	Read the reviews after booking the Hotel, so wasn't expecting to enjoy the stay.The Hotel was great, Art Deco Style, 2 mins from Times Square. Our room was small, we could walk around the bed. To be honest, we only used the room to sleep, so didn't need any more space. It was also clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable. The staff were helpful and polite and pointed us in the right direction for decent places to eat, (Cosmic diner, on the corner of 49th? West and 8th Street was fantastic for breakfast).Everything was within easy walking distance, the subway was a few doors from our hotel.The only downside, was the mouse in our room. I was woken up at 3am by it eating some chocolate I had bought. The staff delt with it straight away by providing a trap and offering to change room. The mouse was never caught, and we didn't move. It didn't ruin the holiday, just made an interesting story when we were back home!"
125,1749,"Mar 3 2007	Clean No Frills Great Location Good Value!	I booked through my airline's website but also relied on the TripAdvisor site for reviews, which were pretty much on the mark. My purpose for travel: 36 hours sightseeing in NYC. The location is great - smack dab in Times Square (which is certainly seeing a gentrification; couldn't believe it!) - and while it was probably the tiniest room I'd ever seen (in a very small building), at $139 it was a bargain and everything was clean and tidy, and as a single female traveler, all I wanted was a safe place to lay my head at night. I suspect that if I had noisy neighbors it might have been a problem 'cause you could certainly hear everything going on in the halls (but during my visit, that meant the maid in the morning and a door or two closing). Front Desk Staff was helpful and friendly, and I'd definitely return for this type of short visit. One note: the hotel's website indicated the restaurants were recently renovated/opened, which is NOT the case ... when I asked at the front desk as to timing, the Receptionist wryly replied &quot;Soon&quot; which is the answer they get from the contractor. But they offer free coffee &amp; capuccino downstairs, and basically just a few steps out the door in either direction will get you to a number of restaurants (Starbucks abound!)."
126,1749,"Feb 25 2007 	Loved it!	Went with 2 friends... room was small but extremely clean! We'd leave, come back and the room was always clean! The staff was more than friendly and helpful. Recommended great restaurants, got us transportation, got us into a club for free bc we were guests there, etc. GREAT location also! Would definitely stay here again!"
127,1749,Feb 24 2007 	Great location	We stayed in New York from the 17th - 23rd February 2007. The location of this hotel was amazing for what we paid. It is located between 2 Metro stops 50th street (50m) and 100m from time square. The service was good and our room was made up each day with fresh towels and very clean. Our room was on the 2nd floor (rm 223) it had a small window in the bathroom but no window in the bedroom. It was very cold during our visit -8oc and our room was lovely and warm. However our friends stayed in a room on the front with a big window and their room was cold and needed additional heaters and blankets. Please remember this is not a 5* hotel.The complimentary tea/coffee is a great idea and when the bar and restaurant opens (end of Feb 07) it will be even better. Had a great time.
128,1749,"Feb 18 2007	A Good little find	After moving from another hotel, we were greeted by friendly staff in a warm lobby, that smelt like clean laundry! Our room was small but comfortable, clean and with a good sized bathroom. The cleaning service was fantastic, could not fault them. Our room was clean and fresh everyday, they even tidied our messy belongings.Only a few faults, the shower was a dribble, could have showered quicker in the rain and there was no ventalation in bathroom, which became a steam room.Other than that our stay was great, city was amazing, for what we paid, we return and would recommend."
129,1749,"Feb 9 2007 	Drab Tired Depressing!!!!!	Amsterdam Court Hotel, New York. 31st January 2007We Booked our New York Break through Airline Network. Looking at the pictures of the Hotel we had expected to be staying in a sort of Retro type hotel. The only way I can describe this place is Tired, Drab and Despressing, so much so that my daughter who had booked the trip just burst into tears.The rooms are small and tatty. Everything is brown and beige.The building is very old and tired. We changed rooms within the first ten minutes only to find the second room more depressing than the first. We decided then and there to find alternative accomodation and checked out within an hour of arriving at extra cost to ourselves. All I would say is if you want to enjoy your stay in New York is don't go to the Amsterdam Court"
130,1749,"Jan 18 2007	Excellent value for money and location	Booked at the last minute. In terms of value for money an excellent place to stay. Well located in the Theatre District but our room was so quiet. Rooms are clean and tidy, beds were comfy, and the staff were lovely and helpful. We paid $90/night in the week, (wed thru fri) which with normal NYC hotel prices was excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are going to visit and explore NYC for a couple days."
131,1749,"Jan 10 2007 	Great Value	We were very pleased with the comfort and location for the price of this hotel. In the heart of Times Square/Theater District, near subway -- we walked everywhere. Our room was very small and the only window had an alley &quot;view&quot; but it was quiet, clean and a VERY comfortable bed. Since we just sleep there we don't care much about amenities -- coffee and tea in the lobby is about it, but there are cafes and a drug store within a block and loads of restaurants nearby. The staff was polite and helpful. The rooms have radiant heat -- ours couldn't be adjusted and grew unbearably hot but we turned on the window air-conditioner and all was fine."
132,1749,"Jan 8 2007 	Expedia lied	This hotel is listed as a three star hotel on Expedia which is a big fat lie. We were given the smallest room ever, I estimate it to be about 7ft by 14ft. I was promptly moved to a larger room, which while decent sized. I am not sure what I would ahve done had they refused to get us a larger room. However, the room was missing a working window and the heater was broken. They were fixed promptly though.I have no specific complaints against the hotel which was actually very good at responding to all our resquests. But do beware this is not a three star hotel, and I have no idea why expedia listed it as such. For just 70 dollars more at night, you can stay at a much nicer place."
133,1749,"Jan 7 2007 	Perfect for Metro	Steps from Red Line, 1/2 block from blue line, 1 block from yellow line. You can virtually end up within 6 blocks of almost all major tourist destinations within minutes on these three lines. NOTE: all three airports offer cheap transport (about $22.00 roundtrip) to the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd street, which is only eight short blocks south from the hotel, or you can take the red line the eight blocks and end up on the same block. Linens were great, clean towels (not sandpaper), clean sheets, I got a tiny spot of ink on our bed spread and it was gone after they cleaned. Rooms are about the size of a US bedroom, 3 suitcases opened no problem. We were blasted by noise from neighbors at 4:30 who were drunk and having an argument, called &amp; less than 2 minutes later they were told they would be thrown out if they did not keep quiet. Radiator heater seemed to be on the fritz, they brought us an electric heater within 20 minutes. The heater did work, we found out. Benefits: Location, clean, great linens,hot water, Ice machine on floor, great customer service. Detriments: Radiator heating, small elevator, no ESPN or MSNBC, Smaller rooms than other cities. Contrary to popular belief NYC hotels are more like Europe than the rest of the US, so finding a large room is very difficult unless you want to pay 250 per night plus or stay in a true rat trap. You may want to ask for room 210, it has a closet that will fit (tightly ) two large suitcases, a writing desk with four large drawers that will hold clothing, and a bathroom with a tub. This will also help you avoid the elevator, which I always prefer."
134,1749,"Jan 5 2007 	Avoid the mice traps!!!	When arriving, the outside was boarded up which we wasnt too fussed about however the room was too small for 2 people it had no wardrobe no mirror and we were unable to have two suitcases open at the same time as there wasnt any room.When having a shower the most horrific noise runs down every pipe in the building.To make things worse we had 3 mice traps under our bed, one of which had a dead mouse in. We were moved by Expida straight away. They were fantastic!!"
135,1749,Dec 12 2006	Very central hotel.	Very central hotel. 5 mins from Times Square. Rooms are not big but have everything you neeed except fridge. Bathroom very small but spotless with fresh towels and toiletries every day. Good place to stay if you are sightseeing and are not spending long in your room.
136,1749,"Dec 6 2006 	Great hotel for the cost	This hotel was great. My wife and I went to NY for our 5th year anniversary. I didnt have any problems with the staff, hotel or rodents like others did. We stayed in room 616 which was extremely clean, neat and smelled good. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone from now on. The rooms are small (We had a king size bed and the bed just about made it to the opposite wall). The water was hot too(be careful)."
137,1749,"Dec 3 2006 	We had a great time!	I can't believe what mixed reviews this hotel has got!We've just returned from staying there a week, and our stay at the Amsterdam Court hotel was fine!After reading the previous reviews, we were quite anxious about what we would get, but from the moment we checked in, to the moment we left our hotel, we had no problems. There were no mice, the hotel staff were friendly, the room was clean and not at all as small as we'd been lead to believe by the previous reviews! There was always free tea and coffee available, and reception were happy to arrange transportation back to JFK.All in all, I would definately come here again. We stayed in 719 if that helps!"
138,1749,"Dec 1 2006 	Terrible hotel	I would strongly suggest finding another hotel. As soon as we got there we stood at the front desk and the lady in the lobby stood there looking at us until i finally greeted her. Then they had no communication with hotels.com, where i booked the room. The woman had no idea we had a reservation even after i provided her with the confirmation numbers and papers that i had printed out. They finally gave us a room. We took the scary and ancient elevator to the sixth floor. This elevator is the slowest elevator i have ever seen. The halls are narrow and dirty looking. The room was smaller than any hotel room i have ever been in. I could barely get out of bed on the side of the bed because the walls are right there. You had better be small for this room. The shower had problems too. The hot water handle became scalding hot while in use and burned my wife's hand when she turned it off. She warned me so that i uses a rag to turn it off. There was also scalding hot water leaking out of the handle so if you do choose this hotel, please watch your kids in the bathroom. There is absolutely no view of anything other than a brick wall. I would expect to pay about $39/night for this type of hotel. I know it is new york and everything but it was horrible. At least my wife and i have something to joke about now."
139,1749,"Nov 27 2006 	High Price + Mice = Not Nice	I arrived with my wife and 6yr old daughter around 9pm and checked in a small room on the 5th floor. We dropped our bags and headed out for dinner (if you want good Mexican in the neighborhood, go to Arriba Arriba's on 52nd &amp; Ninth Ave.). We were back in 3.5 hours after dinner and a walk around Times Square. When we got back to the room my wife saw something move in the room. I stepped toward where she saw the movement and a mouse dashed out of the room, under the closed door. It had gotten into my daughter's carry on and chewed into some candy. We went down to the desk to get relocated, but it was 12:30am. They were going to relocate us to another sister hotel or another room in this hotel. We asked to look at the other rooms and we saw two other rooms before settling into a King bed room on the sixth floor that looked out at the Gershwin Theater and over to B'way. Perfect for watching the Thanksgiving parade while it was raining. I wish we would have read previous reviews before we went. The location is great, but the price for the size and the added amenities of a mouse are not worth it. Later in the stay, I noticed the glue trap tucked under the radiator. The bellman said it was rare that a mouse was spotted on that high a floor!As for the TV, I noticed that the limited cable was High Definition, but the TVs are not, which causes a fluctuation of the picture on the screen. In other words... too much signal. They say they have wifi access in the room, but I didn't bother trying it for the additional fee. Water temperature fluctuated constantly and the water conservative shower heads made it like showering under a mist. Room temperature was difficult to control. Heat emanated from the steam main, even though the radiator valve was closed. We slept with the AC on and a window open during Thanksgiving week!The front desk and bell staff were very helpful. The maintenance worker who visited our room (for a clogged toilet) would benefit from using one of the hotel room's showers though. His odor lingered in our room for so long, I had to run down to Duane Reade's for a scented candle!The bed was comfortable. I would not suggest bringing back leftovers that would remain overnight."
140,1749,"Nov 22 2006 	I was impressed by the Amsterdam Court!	I noticed there are very mixed reviews on the Amsterdam Court, but I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again. We stayed for 5 nights in mid Nov 2006. The room was small, but comfortable and clean. The room was decorated nicely, the bed was cosy and the room was cleaned every day. The bathroom was clean and the towels were changed every day. Not many of the TV channels worked fully (some of them were a bit fuzzy), but who is in The Big Apple to watch TV!? I think the rooms were perfectly acceptable if you don't plan to spend all day in them. The hotel has a very nice lobby with free tea/coffee if you want to spend time in the hotel anyway. The lobby also has a computer with internet access and printer. I found the reception staff at the Amsterdam Court to be extremely helpful. We we're recommended places for breakfast, dinner and given easy to follow directions when needed. The porter/bell boy was also very helpful and helped us to arrange seats on a bus service to the airport which was very useful and a lot cheaper than a yellow taxi. All in all, I was happy with my stay and would go back."
141,1749,"Nov 15 2006 	Well we liked it!	We stayed at the Amsterdam Court for 4 nights and it seems like a lot of other people didn't know what to expect based on the varied reviews listed on Trip Advisor. We were pleasantly suprised by the hotel and the staff. The lobby was fine, both the lifts worked and so did the stairs, the room and bathroom was very adequate and very clean. The bed was made up and the towels were replaced every day. The view wasn't the best but for that price in New York, what do you expect. The staff on the front desk were very helpful and the arrangements for storing our cases and ordering the bus to the airport were excellent. The location could not be faulted with easy access to the subway and the bright lights of Broadway a stones throw away. We would go again."
142,1749,"Nov 13 2006 	Ready to return	My husband and I went to New York City to celebrate his birthday. We had a wonderful time. The Amsterdam Ct. Hotel was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, had plenty of towels, and plenty of amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, clock radio, comfy pillows, not those small, flat things. The Amsterdam Ct. is also in a great location. You can't beat 50th Street and Broadway. It is in the theater district, and only a couple of blocks from Times Square and Rockefeller Center. When we go back to New York, we will definitely stay here again. Our room was on the small side, but not too small. It had plenty of storage space for clothes, shoes, luggage, etc. I hightly recommend The Amsterdam Ct. Hotel."
143,1749,"Nov 13 2006 	awful	We have just returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel. We had also booked a two double bedded room and on arrival were told they could offer us a pull out bed for the third adult. The room was the tiniest I have ever seen, the bathroom was so small you had to sit sidewards on the loo. When I complained the room was not as we booked I was told we would be moved the next day. This other room had two beds but was not much bigger! We also thought we heard mice on the first night. We had no hot water for two of the nights and one lift was broke the entire stay. We booked a car to take us to the airport only to be told it had not in fact been put in the book to be booked! We were nto surprised. A disastrous hotel. Although I agree the location is good there are a lot of other hotels just as good and similarily priced. New York is great and so we still had a great trip but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!"
144,1749,"Nov 11 2006 	Clean and small rooms	The room I was in just fit a bed and had little room to spare. The bathroom was small but very clean. I was in town for business and only using the room for sleeping so it was adequete. If you are staying with a family, you will be very tight for space. This is a reasonably priced new york hotel. I would stay here again if the higher rated hotels were out of rooms or significantly over priced."
145,1749,"Oct 30 2006 	Great location shame about room arrangements	My family and I have just returned from a short break at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. The hotel is in a superb location - Times Square, Broadway theatres &amp; the subway are very close by. The hotel was comfortable &amp; clean but when we arrived we were informed that the room we had booked through our travel agent as a 2 bed room for our teenage children was in fact a single bedded room. The hotel offered to let us have a fold up bed for $20 per night, but the room was so small anyway there would have been no room for this and 2 teenagers! I read previously on this site that travellers are offered a fold out bed for extra cost, but we had booked a 2 bedded room (or so we thought) back in England through our travel agent. Beware if you use the same agent as us (Going Places/Tradewinds) - they informed us when we telephoned them from New York to sort it out that they treated our requirement for a 2 bedded room as a 'request' and were unsupportive. Luckily, our trip to New York was still great and we found an excellent restaurant - the Ninja in Trebeca. The food was delicious, beautifully presented &amp; the Ninja theme made a memorable experience."
146,1749,"Oct 29 2006 	For mice lovers...	I read many reviews before choosing which hotel to book and eventually settled on Amsterdam Court Hotel. It sounded like the majority of reviews on this hotel were positive and that bedrooms were not too small. Our guide book had also said it was for the more 'upmarket traveler'! Unfortunately our experience was far from this.The location is great, but compared to other hotels in NY, this is very small, with a small and dark lobby area. We had paid to upgrade to a King size bed but the room itself was very small and dark looking on to a concrete wall.On our second night we had a nightmare....I was woken up at 3am by the sound of mice under our bed. I was hysterical! We walked the streets of NY from 3-5am trying to get somewhere to sleep. Alarm bells should have rang when I saw the mouse traps. We could not get a room anywhere else that night so had to go back to the hotel and swap rooms in order to get a couple of hours sleep. The room we were given to sleep in looked like a prison cell with a tiny double bed (looked more like a single) and I was relieved we had paid for the upgrade! This room also had mouse traps so the problem must be hotel wide rather than an isolated incident.Luckily Expedia moved us the next day and we went to Park Central Hotel which I would thoroughly recommend. Much more like a proper hotel.We lost a whole nights sleep and pretty much the next day of our holiday sorting this out, packing, moving and unpacking and were knackered! During such a short trip to loose this much time means a great deal.I work in the hotel industry and cannot believe that a hotel that knows it has a mouse problem will continue to take money and bookings for people to stay in rooms which are rodent infested. I am only glad that I woke up and heard the mice, otherwise we would have spent our whole stay with them running around our room at night. They were even in our wardrobe and shredded up papers we had left there. Take my advice - dont risk it."

After I checked in and went to my room, I turned on the TV to find a picture on some channels that looked like the days with rabbit-ear antennae (that dates me!). The building engineer came up and proclaimed that &quot;too much signal&quot; was the problem (figure that one out). I changed rooms, but not much better. After dinner I retired to watch some sports only to discover that the &quot;cable&quot; offered by the hotel was 6 channels (3 network channels barely watchable because of &quot;too much signal&quot;, Food Network, public access and one other). No ESPN, no other channels whatsoever. So, it's probably been 15 years since I had to do this, but you might actually have to ask what having &quot;cable TV&quot; means at this hotel.The rest of the story...room was adequate but dated..lobby the same...elevators from the 1960's...window AC units.I checked out the next morning."
