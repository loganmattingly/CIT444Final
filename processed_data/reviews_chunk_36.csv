285,802,"Feb 28 2006	I am a Hilton Gold VIP not a good service	This is a copy of the letter i sent to the help i did not like the customer service1.I called the hotel and asked where the nearest tube station was. I was then told that it was high street Kensington which was wrong I then had to pay for yet another tube ticket to get me to shepherds bush. 2.I put some chocolate in the mini bar as it was melting. when I got back the mini bar was locked I was staying in room 4028 I reported this to the front desk at 9pm and was told that the system said that the minibar was unlocked but would not let me access it . I woke up and the mini bar was still not fixed. I went down to the front desk and was told that someone would come and look at it. .I is still waiting for the person to come and look at it. And I am Still waiting for that person to turn up . So off to the exec lounge to see what they can do. She call the maintenance department and they said that some one would come and look at it I waited 60min and they went back to my room. The minibar still was not fixed. Therefore, I went to the front desk again and spoken to Shailesh who said again that they will send someone up and will change my room to 7013. Jackson turns up and pushed a button on a remote that fixed it in 5 min why was this not done at 9pm on Friday.3. When staying at the hotel there was a comp breakfast with in the exe room well I was not able to user the exe lounge for breakfast Saturday and Sunday as it was full. I had to go and pay for breakfast some where else,4.I reported this to front desk on the check out and was told that they will get the duty manager to call me on my cell phone I am still awaiting that call.I was looking at becoming a shareholder with in the hotel and I am having second thoughts.I have stayed at the London metropol, the service was great, and I would think of the same service from all Hilton hotels"
286,802,"Feb 22 2006	Great Value Large Rooms nice Hotel	Just got back from 2 nights at the Kensington Hilton I bought this through Priceline for $68 a great buy worth a lot more.I knew where this hotel was situated so it was not a problem there is a bus stop outside and across the road that will take you to Notting Hill or Oxford St.5 min walk to Holland Park tube which is the Central line. There are some very expensive restaurants in Holland Park and a Burger (Tooties) Place. If you want to be in a quite location then this is OK but if your looking for the hustle and bustle immediately outside then NO. You have Sherperds Bush 5 mins to your left or Holland Park on your right everything else is a (small) bus a tube ride away. The hotel was pretty grand for a $68 London hotel .Great front staff,rooms were a real good size compared with other London hotels very good size in deed we were surprized,Clean,Bathroom, Comfortable beds A very good experience I would have loved to have stayed our other two days but they were free with BA at the Paddington Court which was TINY."
287,802,"Feb 2 2006	Pretty awful	The first thing is that this hotel is a long way from the fashionable shopping area of Kensington. It's actually in a not particularly attractive area of Holland Park. I have to say it was a long way down the list of places myself and my partner have stayed in. The foyer area was dark and uninviting and the first room we were given was on one of the upper floors and obviously hadn't been used for a while. There was a bloodstain on the carpet and a cracked tile in the bathroom. We asked for another room which was OK, but nothing special.Breakfast in the morning was quite an experience. We were directed down to the bowels of the hotel where a long queue was forming (outside of the breakfast room itself!) just to get in. I understand this was a temporary arrangement while the main breakfast room was being refurbished, but this had not been explained to us and was really unacceptable. The room in which we (eventually) ate breakfast was a large conference room without any windows. The staff seemed completely overworked, often speaking poor English, and the quality of the food was certainly not what one would expect from a (supposedly) premier London hotel. Especailly as they charged London prices for food and drink. I wrote to Hilton customer service after our stay and received a standard type response - I guess they must be used to it.Don't think just becuase it's a Hilton hotel in a posh sounding area it's necessarily going to be any good."
288,802,Jan 23 2006	a faceless hotel	I stayed at the London Kensington Hilton for only one night. i had to stay at this hotel as it was part of a package i bought with an Eric Clapton concert in the Royal Albert Hall.This is a hotel with no character at all!The rooms are old and with problems and the bathrooms too. There is nothing in particular to mention about this hotel as it is the meaning of an average hotel!Far from the city center with not good facilities and a not polite staff. Maybe because our stay there it was a package.Anyway when i return to London i will try to avoid this hotel.There are better hotels in the town closer to the center and in very good prices.
289,802,Jan 2 2006	Wonderful service......	I stayed at this hotel from the 30th of December to the 2nd of January with my elderly parents . I'd originally found a very favourable rate using an internet company which included a twin guest room with a foldaway bed and breakfast. On checking in I was told I had been given a complimentary room for no extra charge. The rooms and bathrooms were pristine and in good condition. The beds were extremely comfortable and temperature control units were provided in each room. Breakfasts were an absolute treat-a huge selection of food to suit all tastes ! The staff were friendly and attentive but not over-bearing. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family.Buses (94 and 148) pass frequently to stops just outside the hotel and travelling between to and from the West End is not difficult. The only negative would be a slightly smoky lobby.
290,802,"Nov 29 2005	Kensington Hilton a great choice	We just returned from seven days in London, spending four of the nights at the Kensington Hilton on Holland Park Ave. We had been warned that it was out of town and out of the way. Not true! We had a bus stop directly across the street from us and a tube stop only blocks away. The room was spacious by European standards, with two restaurants to choose from. Concierge desk was helpful as was the front desk. We did switch to the Hilton Mews for one of our last nights in London--a mistake! Tiny room, old facility. One might call it cozy, to us it was cramped. It is located right off of Park Lane, but offered no real advantage to us. We should have stayed in Kensington. Next time we'll know. We would recommend the Kensington Hilton."
291,802,"Nov 28 2005	3 days in London	I just returned home from a vacation to Europe that include a 3 night stay at the Hilton Kensington. Based on the quality of the room and the price I paid through priceline ($75 US), I was more than satisified with my stay. The room was clean, updated and modern. The staff was very helpful (a much needed corkscrew was delivered in under a minute!) and the workout facilities were top notch. I would wind down the cold days with a break in the steam and sauna rooms.Overall, a great experience for the price. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood with access to authentic pubs and restaurants, and close to Holland and Hyde parks. You can take the #94 and #148 buses to nearly every major tourist attraction."
292,802,"Nov 25 2005	You Get What You Pay For	We stayed at the Hilton in Kensington just before Christmas to do a spot of Christmas shopping. The location of the hotel is good, a short walk from the tube or the bus stops right outside the hotel and runs 24 hours. Its a good base for seeing London but the journey into the city can get a bit tedious if you are doing it a lot.The hotel itself is a bit tired. Having said that we only paid 64 pounds per night and for what we paid we had no complaints. The concerige were very helpful and breakfast was good. The rest of the staff we just ok. We did have cause for complaint on one occassion and the duty manager was fantastic. Sent a bottle of wine to the room by was of apology.Tip - Ask for a room on the 5 floor or above as these have been refubished."
293,802,"Nov 7 2005	Fantastic break - highly reccomended	We booked this hotel and then checked the reviews on other sites.... I have to say I was rather worried... but it was booked. The hotel is 8 mins. walk from Holland park tube (or get the 94 or 148) bus which drops off right outside When we arrived the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was small (what do you expect from London) but clean and very comfy (best nights sleep I have had in a hotel) the food was fantastic, breakfast set us up for the day... I certainly intend to go back to London in February with my children and I will not bother checking any other hotels..."
294,802,"Nov 4 2005	Pretty good deal for the price	Booked this hotel online (for 89 GBP), where I had stayed my first time in London 12 years ago, so I knew what we were getting into. I was neither disappointed nor pleasantly surprised. Even though I'm a Hilton Honors member, we were not given a refurbished room, but we found the rather smallish twin-bedded room adequate and comfortable for our 5-day stay. Next time, I will be a bit more assertive and ask for an upgraded room. I like this place because it's in a very nice neighborhood; walking on the street at midnight did not make me uncomfortable at all. The tube stop is less than a 10-minute walk and takes you past several &quot;necessity&quot; retail shops like a small supermarket, a deli, pharmacy, camera shop and several nice restaurants. Front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Bell staff greeted us every time we walked by. Did not eat in the bar or restaurant because we were always in a rush to get to the theatre. I don't care for the overwhelming odor of smoke from the bar the second you enter the front door...but this is England after all where non-smoking accommodations are not yet the norm. I hope they (and the rest of Europe) catch up to us soon! Overall, a very decent lodging experience. I will come back."
295,802,"Oct 22 2005	Excellent Experience	Located in a nice residential area, this hotel was a pleasant surprise. We stayed for 8 days and had a newly renovated room-very comfortable although a little cramped. There was a bus stop directly at the door and we felt very comfortable walking everywhere at night. All in all an excellent experience."
296,802,"Oct 14 2005	Awesome Value For US$70!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in the beginning of Oct. We got the deal through Priceline. For US$70, we have absolutely no complains. the hotel looks dated but our room was clean, the double bed was comfy, and the front desk staff were friendly, and the Concierge staff were extremely helpful. The hotel is 8 mins walk away from the Holland Park tube station. There's not much around the hotel except for a Tesco (supermarket) 10 mins walk away."
297,802,"Oct 8 2005	Great Stay	I cannot comment on value because we stayed here using points.Our five day stay started off shaky since the room we were given was obviously for a single with no luggage; we could not move except by going over the bed.We were given a new room the next day which was more than adequate. The staff was always friendly and courteous, especially the concierge. The location is ideal for anybody who is touring; with a bus stop outside to take you to a tube stop which is only aboidut a seven - ten minute walk at the most but appreciated after a long day of touring on your own.We did not eat at the restaurant but it looked appealing. We did eat at the &quot;bar&quot; area and the staff was agaion helpful and courteous.There are a number of restaurants on the way to the tube stop so we tended to try to eat out and conserve our precious pounds.I would reommend this hotel without reservation and say that it equals some of the four star Hiltons I have stayed in the States."
298,802,"Sep 28 2005	Great Hotel	After reading all of the bad reviews on this hotel I was very nervous about my stay in September. I enrolled in the Hilton Honors Club one week before we went and sent an email to the hotel with my club number. When my husband and I arrived they already had my Hilton Honors club number and put us on the executive floor (7). This entitled us to the continental breakfast, evening drinks (wine, beer, mixed drinks, water, juice and cokes) and snacks in their executive lounge. This came in very handy because I had booked on their website and prepaid at a very good price which didn't include breakfast. The room we had was very large compared to our room in Paris. We didn't have a great view but since we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't care. We also had several bottles of water left for us in the room that we were not charged for and they also replaced every day. The front desk informed me that they have completed the renevations so there was no noise during our stay. When we arrived our safe didn't work and we didn't have an iron. On our way out around 12:00 noon I told the front desk and when we returned the safe was fixed and we had an iron. We were told by the staff to not used the closer tube station (Shepards's Bush) but to use the Holland Park station which is about 4 blocks up the street. I have absolutely no complaints about this hotel and would stay there again."
299,802,"Sep 26 2005 	Overall Nice Stay	Stayed 1 night in August. REad reviews before I booked and asked for refurbished room. Overall very nice although 15 for Wifi in room is a bit excessive. Restaurant was good. Overall very good.PLease be aware that if you have baggage its a fair walk from either Shepherds Bush tube or Holland Park, so take a cab."
300,802,"Sep 25 2005	unsatisfactory	The price of the room, around $200 was the only thing to recommend for this hotel. The rooms were small, one minuscule closet that could barely accomodate 2 suites.The bath room was cramped with a high tub, if you are taller than 6' you may need to stoop. The carpeting was stained inside and outside the room, the walls were dingy . There was no safe in the room, a big inconvenience for me. The TV had a grainy image and you can easily hear the toilets flushing in the adjacent rooms. The breakfast buffet was costly for its limited selection and mediocre quality."
301,802,"Sep 25 2005	Good value	Good value hotel, a little away from a tube, but a short bus ride to High Street Ken."
302,802,"Aug 10 2005	Will be great when the reno is complete	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Kensington for 6 nights in July. Our first impression on walking in was that the hotel was very nice. The main floor has a the AM/PM Lounge, a larger restaurant and a small tuck shop. There is also a door for direct access into an Asian restaurant. We arrived early in the day, having flown in from Toronto and were so pleased to learn that we could have a room right away. Unfortunately, the first room we had was awful. The furnishings were worn and dated and the bathroom had seen better times - the shower also had a ridiculously low ceiling and my husband had to keep his neck bent to shower! We lay down for a much needed nap and then the drilling started - right above us. It appears that they are renovating 1-2 entire floors and it's very noisy. We asked how long the drilling would last and they said it is every day from 9am to 5pm. We asked to change rooms and the next room we had was nicer - it had already been refurbished and it was just generally cleaner and fresher - it had a proper shower! Unfortunately, the drilling noises were still very loud and we were moved to an executive room. These rooms appear to be above the floor that is being renovated and are much quieter - we didn't experience any more construction noise. The executive room we had was larger than the standard room, had lovely furnishings and a duvet. The bathroom was marble up to the ceiling and the room even had 3 phones. There is a small bar area by the door with complimentary coffee, tea and bottled water. We were not able to use the executive lounge because, of course, it's under renovation - they do convert part of the rear lobby lounge into an executive lounge in the afternoons, but we were never around to enjoy our complimentary drinks anyway. As for the neighbourhood in which the hotel is located, we loved it. We both bought 1 week tube passes for Zones 1-2 and just hopped on the tube to get anywhere - forget about most buses - the traffic is so bad you will be in traffic forever. The Holland Park metro station is 2 bus stops from the hotel, which is really only about a 7 to 10 minute walk along Holland Park Ave. It's a nice walk with great little shops, restaurants and very expensive flats and townhouses. It's a really nice, quiet neighbourhood which we actually enjoyed after spending our evenings closer to the heart of the city - busy spots like Leicester Sq. All in all, we found the staff and service at the hotel to be top notch. They addressed our concerns about the noise and we had a room we were very happy with. The concierge service is also excellent. Granted, there should be a warning on the Hilton website about the massive renovation. We would however definately recommend the hotel to friends and family and would stay there again - hopefully the construction will be finished."
303,802,Aug 2 2005 	Awful Hotel - leave well alone!!	This hotel is not really in Kensington at all - even the taxi drivers agreed with me on that point - it is very misleading of Hilton Hotels to call it Kensington - it cost me 20 each way to get to The Strand by Taxi!!I booked an exec room with access to the exec lounge - on arrival I was told it was closed due to a fire at least a month ago!! Nobody had mentioned that when I booked the room - no mention on the web siteThe rooms were horrible - they were supposed to be newly refurbished and executive but they were very very small - smaller than even a cabin on some ships! They were not what I would have called refurbished! I changed room three times but they were all the same tiny roomsThe worse thing about the hotel is that it is undergoing major refurbishment which it badly needs - there is no mention again of this on the web site where I booked the hotel - the banging and drilling are non stop all day from first thing in the morning!!It is what I would call a transient hotel used by aircraft crew and the main reception areas and restaurants are all very drab and unwelcoming - not at all what I expected from the Hilton GroupIt took many many phone calls to Hilton to even get the room changed and they refused to change my hotel for me despite all the above problems - namely the building work and lack of an exec lounge that I had booked!In short I wouldnt recommend this hotel at all
304,802,"Jul 17 2005	Not really in Kensington	I read several good reviews before booking this through Priceline. However, we were disappointed upon arrival. Had to stand in line for some time for check-in at 11:00 p.m. When arrived at my room, it was next to the elevator and a single. Had to go back downstairs and stand in line to get the double room we had reserved. Rooms are very small and very worn. I am not sure why they consider this the Kensington location. Getting from Harrods to the hotel cost 15 pounds. Internet connection did not work in the room and, although they did send a service guy, he could not fix it. All that said, I would have been pretty upset if we had paid normal prices, but luckily we got it for $110/night on Priceline."
305,802,Jun 14 2005 	Tiny and very noisy 'executive' room!	Being a Diamond Honors member I was given an 'executive' room on the 6th floor. However the room turned out to be tiny and the 'double' bed very small. The decor of the room was OK but the bathroom was very tacky with a plastic toilet seat and black marble cladding. Looked straight out of the 80's. The hotel is quite noisy but eventually I managed to drift off only to be woken up at 5:00am by the mini-bar which was making an extremely loud buzzing / vibrating sound. It was clearly faulty and it took them half an hour to cut the power off to the unit. By which time I was fully awake and resigned to an un-planned early start to the day. Also I had to pay 17 to use their car-park for a measly 10 hours.I think there is a myth surrounding Hilton hotels and their quality. I have stayed in many and on the whole the chain is pretty average with a rare selection of extremely high class hotels and a large number of very average hotels.
306,802,"Jun 13 2005 	Very Pleased and Impressed	Intro:I have no quams with awarding the Hilton London Kensington with a well-deserved Trip-Advisor 4-Star Rating. I am being careful in writing this review whilst taking in the following factors espescially; Cost and Service - as the two are normally related directly to each other, as unfortunate as that likelihood is - it was most pleasantly not the case at the London Hilton Kensington Hotel. As A very well-travelled avid Trip Advisor reviewee, I have stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels in the world, and indeed London. For this particular trip my sister and I were attending an important event at the Exhibition Centre, Earl's Court - thus, we chose function over fashion - that is, Hilton Kensington. We were pleasantly impressed!Review:Location is easy to get to via Public Transport; from Heathrow one should merely take TWO tubes and then a Bus. Located in a pleasant neighbourhood by Notting Hill and Portobello Market. 3-5 mins walk from Sheperd's Bush underground taking you direct to the heart of Oxfor St. or a taxi for 10 to Knighstbridge - if budgeting my personal recommendation would be 6 Zone Card for Zones 1-6 (entire London) allowing full use of Underground, Trains + Standard Rail + Buses. Fabulous.Check-In staff, Han, was very helpful in kindly granting permission for my sister's friend to stay with us in our room free of charge. We had the option of a roll-away for her, but unfortunately that would require a down-grade from our Executive Room to a Standard Room as the Executive contained excess furninshings. We stuck with the Executive Room as they are much nicer, spacious and give access to the Executive Lounge for complimentary Continental Breakfast (ample) and afternoon-evening drinks (decent)Room Service was prompt + well-priced. MiniBar slightly overpriced but decent.Majority of staff extremely helpful and not all, &quot;fishing for tips&quot;. Notable commendation to the concierge, Antonio - who amazingly managed to gain us and some friends VIP access to a very exclusive club in London. Thanks!One must remember this Hilton is only a three-star. It is pleasantly furnished, well serviced, and reflects a higher standard than many, &quot;historical-five-stars&quot;, in London, that survive by reputation.Overall, a very good trip that deserves high commendations. Thanks."
307,802,"May 27 2005	Pleased	After reading reviews, I was a bit uneasy after reserving through Priceline. However, I was pleased with the accommodations. The staff was very friendly, competent, professional and accommodating (a 1230pm late check out was readily granted.) No problem with the Priceline reservation as the clerk stated, &quot;you are pre- paid&quot;. I requested a room on the 1st or 2nd floor. A brief pause until I produced my Hilton Honors Card and we then had a choice of a room on the front or facing a building on the first floor (HiltonHonors Floor). The reservation clerk warned about the potential for noise in a front facing room but it was not a problem for us and I preferred looking at beautiful 100 year old trees instead of a 100 year old building. The quite clean room was ample sized with tasteful decor, fluffy &quot;feather&quot; comforter, smooth linen, complimentary in-room coffee, tea, shortbread cookies. It is true that it may be a &quot;duck&quot; for a tall person in the shower but other than that, the marble bathroom was small but clean with the usual complimentary amenities, large bathtowels and washcloths! The only disadvantage to this hotel is the somewhat &quot;off center&quot; locaiton. The double decker stops in front with direct access to Picadilly or Westminister but slow going in traffic. The tube is about 10 minutes away. . .the taxi from Victoria was $30.00, however. The Airbus no longer stops at this hotel so we took the Hotelink van to Heathrow at 16 pounds per person. If location, location, location is your primary criteria, consider other hotels but otherwise, I was pleased with this hotel. Its not near the center of London although there are interesting sights nearby such as Notting Hill, Portabello Road and Kensington Gardens. The neighborhood is quiet and safe."
308,802,"May 20 2005	Nice above average no complaints	I had a very nice stay here. I suspect most of the people unhappy with the rooms had much higher expectations for a Hilton, but I found the rooms to be larger than I expected for a European hotel, the hotel was clean, it had all the things we needed (or they were supplied upon request), the staff was helpful, and it was convenient both for getting around town and getting to/from Heathrow. I wasn't &quot;wow'ed&quot; by the hotel, but I wasn't expecting to be: if you're looking for high luxury, you're going to have to pay a lot more in London. But it's a nice, above average hotel if you can get it at a decent price. It is in a residential area, about a 7 minute walk to the Holland Park tube, there is a grocery store/restaurants/ shops/Starbucks all on the way to the tube, it is walking distance (about 10-15 minutes) to Notting Hill, and we actually liked that it was a bit outside the center of the city and we could see a non-tourist area. The only negative would be if you were out late in another area of town and the tube closed; it would be costly to return to Holland Park by taxi. But I would easily stay here again."
309,802,"May 10 2005 	For a Hilton - Just average	To be brief, this hotel was just average. The first night they delivered an iron and board to my room and, as I proceeded to iron my shirt for work the next day, discovered that the iron was dirty and had left a terrible black mark on my shirt. Not a good start. The hotel did, however, have it cleaned for free (although the stain was not removed properly).The bathroom was quite tatty, and unless you are under 5ft 8&quot; the shower is not high enough. I had to bend down to take a shower - very uncomfortable.I got a good price on priceline for this hotel, and unless you do the same don't stay at this hotel. there are better alternatives for the price."
310,802,"Apr 24 2005	Okay for the special price	In short: The hotel is okay, when you get a special price offer. Otherwise I would take something different.Long story: We have stayed several times in London and it`s not always easy to get a decent room for a affordable price. This time I browsed through the internet and got an offer for the Kensington Hilton for 69 Pounds a night. Wow, I thought, a Hilton for this price. Usually this is what I pay for a 3 star hotel in London. And I booked it. Later I read the reviews here and wasn`t sure, if this was the right decision. I exspected a luxury hotel (I thought Hilton = Luxury), but the reviews were not very encouraging. I came there and it turned out to be fine. We got a room in the first floor, which was not really big, but okay. A little bigger than the room of a 3 star hotel. The room was clean and gut furnished. But no lurury, just normal standards. It was good, that I read the reviews before, otherwise I would have been disappointed. So it was okay for that price. But would it have costed more, it wouldnt be worth it. The location is okay for the Portobello Road Market and Notting Hill, otherwise it`s pretty far away from the real center. But you can get anywhere by subway and busses. It is in a very nice neighborhood. A supermarket, Starbucks and some small shops at the Holland Park Station, about a walk of 10 minutes away."
311,802,"Apr 18 2005	Small room but nice furnishings	Having stayed at the Hilton Metropole last year I was rather spoilt and had been warned that the rooms of the Hilton Kensington had originally been designed and used by air crew stopover staff. However I'm not one to be put off easily and decided to see for myself.Stayed in an executive room on the 6th floor with access to the executive lounge which serves complimentary drinks and hot snacks in the evening. Although comparing it to the Metropole where i had also stayed executive the standard was a lot lower here. For example during the mid afternoon at the metrople a high tea is served, including every little sandwich you can think of and cakes galore. I was rather looking forward to this little pleasure and terribly disappointed to find that even the coffee machine was out of order. Another groan about the executive lounge is that it closes an hour earlier than the Metropole at 9pm, which is rather disappointing as it would have been nice to have had a night cap.The Hilton breakfast was divine and a very pretty walk past the famous Lidgate butchers (which is recommended in Rick Stein's food heroes book) to the Holland park tube. overall I wouldn't go back again as I like to try other hotels but I also would not advise you to stay here. Enjoy your trip!"
312,802,"Apr 13 2005	Fantastic Hotel ! A++++!!!!!!	I stayed at the Hilton London Kensington four nights and found it to be an incredible hotel! I was a little concerned by some of the comments that have been posted about the room being small but I found it large and comfortable (I was on the second floor) the staff was very friendly and the location was excellent .The nearest tube station is Holland Park on the Central Line, if one goes East one station you come to Notting Hill where you can change to the Circle &amp; District Lines and go pretty much anywhere in London. Getting back to the room itself, It was equipped with cable television which had besides British channels, Arabic, German, Indian and Far Eastern stations on them as well (I have no idea what they were saying but it looked interesting!) All in all My one complaint is that I could not have stayed longer!"
313,802,"Feb 2 2005	Adequate for budget traveling	Spent 2 nights, 2 weeks apart at the Hilton. Both times, the rooms were small (by U.S. standards) on the first floor. The beds were comfortable with good quality linens, and the rooms had decent towels (i.e. not thread bare). One time we had a view facing interior to the industrial vents and machinery above the ground floor. The other time we faced a small private park off of Holland Park Ave. Street noise was minor. The main noise factor came from doors slamming at all hours, since the hotel caters to folks coming in from Long Distance hauls at Heathrow. Bring ear plugs. The staff was friendly and accomodating. On the 2nd visit, we asked for a room different than the 2nd floor room assigned because the latter had a bathroom that was moldy from top to bottom and my husband has a mold allergy. Staff moved us to a twin on the first floor. Twins have more room to move around and if you don't mind separate beds, they appear to be a better value. The hotel appears to be hierarchically organized where more frequent visitors get better (larger) rooms and bennies. Be aware that some rooms have TV's on the floor that become trip and broken-toe hazards because the floor space is so limited. For travelers accustomed to U.S. Hilton standards, this hotel is not what you are expecting. But it is adequate for budget travelers who book for 69-79 pounds a night in an outrageoulsy expensive city given the current exchage rate."
314,802,"Jan 21 2005	What A Pleasure	From the moment we arrived from a typically uncomfortable long flight, tired and irritated, to when we left eight days later, this hotel was pure pleasure. Ian at the front desk is an absolute star and an asset to this hotel. Ian went out of his way to arrange a room badgering housekeeping until we got one which was on the first floor. This was done within an hour despite it being early morning and the hotel fully booked the night previously. The room was very comfortable and well equipped. The rate the Hilton gave us was unparalleled value for money. A tube station is less than 5 minutes walk away, a bus stop is right outside, several shops and restaurants are close by so the location is perfect. The front desk was exceptionally helpful at all times and every other aspect of the hotel is proficient notably housekeeping, room service, laundry and the restaurant. Thanks to staff like Ian, the Hilton Hotel made our holiday in London one of the most memorable and enjoyable."
315,802,"Dec 15 2004	Better than the last train home	The room was so small and nasty that it looked like it should have been rented by the hour not by the night! However, it is cheap for London and if you are planning a night out in Notting Hill then it is preferrable to having to clock watch for the last commuter train home to suburbia."
316,802,"Dec 7 2004	Be sure not to get old crew rooms...	Stayed here Oct. 26 thru 31, 2004. This was our first time in London, and this hotel was reccomended. After a horrible plane trip from Rome, showed up at the hotel lobby to be greeted by a woman who couldn't speak English very well. After getting over language barrier, was asked for our credit card when we had paid in advance. Then was told that our credit card was no good and that we needed another one. That's when we informed the girl we had paid in advance. She rushed to get us our room key, sensing we were alittle annoyed. When we get to our room, we found it to be the smallest room we had ever seen, even by European standards! Once the bellman brought our bags, there was no place to walk. We were on the second floor directly above the lobby atrium, complete with sunroof that looked directly into our room! What a view! We had booked this hotel online directly through Hilton, and this room was not what the pictures showed, or what our friends had described. When I called the front desk to see about relocating, I again got the same girl, who asked me if I preferred smoking or non-smoking. When I said I perferred n/s, she said there was nothing else available. When I said I would take smoking then, she said there was nothing else available in smoking either. Why bother asking my preference than? She said to maybe check back in a couple hours. I asked wht time check in was and was told 2pm. It was 2:20pm, what difference would a couple hours make? At this point, my husband and I went to the front desk and spoke to a gentleman who quickly moved us to a beautiful, full size room that had a view of the street! Loved it!! We were later told by our bellman that the small rooms were orginally&quot;crew&quot; rooms from when the hotel was owned by Trans World Airline. So be sure to not get the old crewrooms they are smaller than the littlest cabin on a cruise ship! After that, we had a great time at the hotel. Had drinks and snacks in the lobby bar and dinner at the Asian restaurant, and both were very good."
317,802,"Nov 24 2004	Great value for the money; location isn't the greatest!	I have stayed at this hotel 3 times and I keep coming back for several reasons. The rates that I get at the Hilton website, especially the non-refundable rates, are excellent. I recently stayed for 69 GBP a night.The location is definitely not the greatest and as many people have pointed out it's about a 7 or 8 minute pleasant walk to the Holland Park tube station and probably a 5 minute not-too-pleasant walk under a busy intersection to the Shepard's Bush hotel. It's a perfectly safe and fine neighborhood just dull with nothing really, really nearby although Notting Hill is a short walk away.Previous postings about this hotel are quite accurate. Check-in can be excruciatingly slow but I've also had times where I'm the only person checking in and it's highly efficient.The comments about the buffet are accurate although it's a decent buffet. And comments about the rooms may or may not be correct. Let's face it. London hotel rooms don't tend to be as spacious as in other parts of the world. But I've never found the Kensington hotel room size to be an issue. They've always had a double bed and a small but ample bathroom.It's a busy hotel with a fair number of tour groups and airline staff staying there which may explain the hit or miss aspect to check-in. If you get there when these large groups are arriving it can be slow.But on balance this is a fine, fine hotel and if you're a leisure tourist with a great rate I think you'll have very few complaints about this hotel. It's thoroughly representative of the Hilton brand and I keep coming back whenever I'm in London based on the very, very attractive rates I seem to get at this property.I would recommend this place."
318,802,"Nov 18 2004	Great Location	It took me awhile to find a Hotel to stay in London, since there are tons of hotels there. I must say, I was hesitant to get a low cost accomodation, due to some negative feedbacks I read from this site, so to play it safe, I chose a hotel chain. Hilton Kensington, Location is very good, very accesible to bus stop (just in front of the hotel) and subway (a little 7 minutes walk from the station). If you're planning to take buses and subway, do buy a travel card before going to London, available in 1,3,7 days and it's worth it. You can just jump in any buses and subway even railways without queing to buy tickets and thinking of having an exact fare. Very convenient. Room is good size for 2 person, clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet which was inclusive in our rate was great, although staying for 1 week in the hotel and eating the same breakfast everyday was not a good idea. Although, my only disappointment was about the staffs, during a busy day, there are only 3 staffs at the front desk, and they seems to have a slow service, having me qued for more than 30mins just to check in. And staffs are not that helpful and friendly."
319,802,"Nov 16 2004	Small rooms OK location could be better	We stayed in this Hilton Kensington in October 2004. London being as pricey as it is, we got a room here via Priceline for US$150 per nite total. The hotel is located near Notting Hill and Hyde Park and is about a 8 minute walk to the Holland Park Tube station. There is a direct airport bus from Heathrow, but we were told that the service would be discountinued by the end of this year. The rooms themselves were very small. Barely enough room to change your mind. The closets had hangers that hang your clothes sideways (to save space). Our room on the 5th floor had an extremely irritating toilet, which you had to flush about 8 or more times before you were able to get rid of the waste. Very annoying for us, as well as for our neighbors, i'm sure. We only stayed two nites so not worth it trying to switch rooms. The dining room had a long line for the breakfast buffet (which we didn't try)."
320,802,"Nov 16 2004	had a great stay staff friendly and helpful	we have just returned from a trip in england and stayed at the hilton kensington hotel for 4 nights [oct 04] We had a double room on the 5th floor and found the room to be clean and quite a good size the bathroom was small but it had a double shower the room had a desk and 2 chairs which most london hotels will not fit in.The staff are very helpful and friendly and will help with luggage taxi,s etc although taxi service is usually right outside the door a bus stop is also outside the hotel and a pick up point for the london bus tour picks up across the rd.The hotel had 3 Eating areas and a bar to sit in at night. each night the staff in the bar bring a complimentary bowl of savoury snacks to the tables expect to pay over the odds for drinks and food but you can eat in several other places just a short walk away.We found the hall ways to be a little tired and in need of refurbishment and brought that to the attention on the customer survey that you get in your room we recieved a lovely letter when we got home telling us they will rectify this matter and to let them know when we stay again. we have recommended the hotel to friends nad will stay at the hotel when we are in london again the price we paid was very reasonable and it surprise me some of the poor comments in this review page maybe these people should pay a lot more and stop at a 5 star hotel not a 4 star"
321,802,"Oct 31 2004	Demand room on first or second floor	We stayed at this hotel for a total of five nights on two different visits. It was recommended by Insight Tours, a company that we thought had better booking connections. Our first room at the hotel had non working room telephones and television (we missed important messages as messages are printed on the television); out dated furniture; worn carpeting, and we could hear the toilets flushing from rooms above us all night long. We requested a different room: it had no bedding on the beds and we tripped going into the room because of torn carpeting. Our third room ( on the renovated second floor) was decent, but small. The management turned off the air conditioning (which was still needed in our mid September visit); if we wanted any air circulation, we had to try to tolerate the noise from Holland Park Road. We insisted on a room on the second or first floor on our second visit....room was fine. If one plans on using this out of the way hotel, insist on a room on the first or second floor (renovated rooms)."
322,802,"Sep 21 2004	recommended	I stayed at the Hilton Kensington for three days in September 2004 and recommend it. The single rooms are more than twice the size of what Ive had elsewhere in the city (though not as large as an American Hilton). The price was moderate and the room was very clean. The walls and windows were thick enough to block most noise from the street and other rooms. But the plumbing could clearly be heard when my neighbors started showering. More than that, the pipes screeched at times making sleep impossible when my neighbors started their morning bathroom routine.Other downsides of the hotel: its not as conveniently located to a tube station as other properties. But the walk to the Holland Park stop is not unpleasant and has a caf, a market, a pub along the way. There is also a bus stop right in front of the hotel. Not only the city busses stop there, so does the shuttle to Heathrow which makes getting to the airport a breeze. There was a gaffe at the front desk, as well. They somehow listed me as a member of a tourist group to which I didnt belong. This involved a 6:30am wake up call I didnt request, followed up by a bell hop barging into my room while I was still in bed insisting that he needed to take my luggage and me trying to explain that I didnt leave until the next morning."
323,802,"Sep 20 2004	Never Again	Having arrived at the hotel after a tiring journey I was quite looking forward to staying at the Hilton. As soon as I opened the door to my room I was met by the strong smell of cigarette smoke - I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room. A quick glance to the left into the bathroom (I didn't venture into it) revealed a toilet bowl plastered, and I mean plastered, with excrement. I managed to find the telephone, in the dark as the main light did not work, and called reception. A few minutes later I was met outside the room by the duty manager .... to say I wasn't pleased is an understatement. After venting my anger the duty manager showed me to another room, having blamed the cleaners for the sorry state of the accommodation. The second room was adequate although the decor had seen better days and I couldn't stand upright in the shower ... I'm quite tall but anyone over 5'8&quot; would have to shower with their knuckles dragging on the floor of the bath (no separate shower). I travel regularly, both with work and on holiday, and I have never had an experience like that provided by the Hilton Kensington. Not to be repeated."
324,802,"Jun 23 2004	good place to staywhen visiting London	Our first trip to London and I was expecting really small rooms, ours was jsut like a room in the states. From the airport you take a convient bus and the hotel is the first stop on the route. There is a tube entrance just minutes from the hotel, which was really convient, when we came back in the evening if we had not eaten there are several really nice place to chose from between the subway and teh hotel. Convient , Clean, Helpful and friendly what more can I say"
325,802,"May 26 2004	Hilton Kensinton OK	Hilton Kensington: Older Hilton with 7 floors. Room small but clean and maid service good. Staff very good to OK. Fancy lobby with 3 places to eat and shop. Taxi cabs usually outside from 4 am onwards and bus stops right outside. Tube stop about 6 block walk. Our room was quiet and slept well. Only problem was a/c was poor and room never got &quot;cold&quot; on a warm night. Problem was addressed well by staff: gave us fan and sent maintance man up to check. Since it cooled off the next night was not a problem for rest of stay, but would be concerned if they have another hot summer in London. Would recommend to friends."
326,802,"Mar 7 2004	Thought it was great!!	I stayed at the Hilton January 1-4, 2004, and was thoroughtly surprised at how nice my room was, given some of the reviews I had read about this hotel. My room (and bathroom) was very spacious and clean, and it appeared to have been redone fairly recently. Also numerous cable TV channels. I am a Hilton Gold Honors member, so that may have helped me avoid the bad rooms that are described in other reviews. However, I was also paying for my room with Hilton points, so considering that I was getting it for free, it seems likely that I would have been relegated to a lesser room. I really enjoyed the location--it is a little farther out of central London than would be ideal, but the surrounding neighborhood is beautiful--full of old homes and mansions. The walk to the Holland Park Underground stop is about 5 minutes. There are several decent restaurants within a short walk of the hotel--my favorite was one that had one of the few non-smoking sections in any of the restaurants in London so I ate several dinners there. Notting Hill and the Portobello Market are also closeby--both extremely interesting areas to stroll in. Overall, I thought this hotel was great--excellent location, good surroundings, good access."

1,807,"Sep 11 2009 	Booked this hotel but got moved to another	I had booked a room but when I arrived to check in I was told there was no room available and I had to be transferred to another hotel in Bayswater. The staff were extremely unhelpful and quite rude. The hotel I was transferred to (Kensington Town House) was lousy. I will never book a Best Western hotel again if this is how they treat their customers, especially a lone female."
2,807,"Jun 17 2009 	Small but comfortable	I booked over the net for the &quot;Hogarth Executive Rooms&quot; which showed a white building as the location. Upon arrival we were actually on the other side of the road from the white buildings in the Best Western by Shaftesbury, but the street address was correct??As we had just flown for 24 hours all we wanted to do was freshen up so we went up to our 3rd floor room and tried to access it, but the keycard wouldn't allow it to open. Back down again to reception and it opened this time to a very small but clean room. So small that you couldn't actually use the desk to write as the chair didn't have enough room to pull out to sit in, even if you were really small. Basically the room was well furnished with quality fittings, probably less or smaller furniture would have been better to move around. The bed was only a double size as nothing bigger would fit, but comfy. For location it was great, only 2 minute walk to the Tube railway station. The bathroom was small but very clean and useable. The room was advertised as having a refrigerator but on inspection there was no fridge and as we were only there for 2 days didn't bother about it as we were only there to sleep anyway. Internet access is available by cable only, not wireless."
3,807,"May 22 2009 	Bizarre little place but actually quite nice!	Stayed here for a business meeting in London as the rate was so low.Was expecting a complete dive, but the room was actually very pleasant.You have to check-in at the Best Western across the road and on subsequent visits, they have actually 'upgraded' me a a nice room in that hotel, which is fine.Very randon microwave in a cupboard, but other than that, all you could ask for from a business hotel (or even a good base for a stag/hen weekend)"
4,807,"Feb 17 2009 	Small dirty and no service	OK, I work for over 20 years with the travel industry and select suppliers (airlines, hotels, etc.) for large corporations, hence I look at a property in extreme details. As I am always looking for hotels that I would put a business person in, I was attracted by the location and amenities offered by the hotel.First and foremost there are truly two properties with the same address - The Best Western Shaftesbury Premier (a 70' concrete building) and the Shaftesbury Executive which is also referred to as Hogarth Execuitve Rooms by Shaftesbury (a 4 story townhouse across the street). This is all terribly confusing as the hotel staff seem to treat them as one and the same.As I was arriving around 6am, I purposely booked the night before to make sure I have a room upon arrival. When checking in I was advised that they did not receive the late check-in message and therefore treated it as a now-show. In other words I was charged for the room and they still gave it away to someone else. Things can happen with reservation, however, to make this the customers fault is not acceptable.Despite claiming they were absolutely sold out I was offered another room in the main building (Best Western Shaftesbury). The room was in the basement and had no windows at all - unacceptable. When I advised them I was suddenly moved to a main room in the building...temporarily as they said. After a 26 hour flight I finally took a nap just to be woken by staff, advising me that they now have a room in the Executive building (the townhouse across the street) and that they would be up shortly to move me again. I declined and told them that I would do this in the afternoon after resting. They were apparently not happy with that decision (as they already had a guest for the room they put me in temporarily).All the hotel facilities are in the &quot;old&quot; Best Western building (restaurant, gym, etc.) and the Townhouse has only &quot;executive rooms&quot;. Having see both rooms now I can assure you that there is NO difference between the rooms. The common areas are worn and look pretty bad. The rooms on the other hand were recently renovated and look as &quot;good&quot; as the pictures promise. However, the rooms are not maintained well at all. While the carpet in the center of the room is clean, all around the edges there is at least 2 centimeters deep border of dust (see picture). One light switch was broken and could only be turned by using your fingernail. The foot of the microwave was broken and held up with a napkin that was folder numerous times (see picture). The shower-head was covered in Limescale. The heater in the bathroom had rust-marks on the floor. The bathtub had mold (see picture). The window ledge was covered in cigaret buds, coffee utensils, etc. While the main building had cable TV (50+ channels) the executive rooms had only 8. The top of the closet where my luggage was stored was covered in dust (see picture). etc., etc, etc.The short of it is that the hotel rooms are VERY small but nicely furnished, however, the property is very badly maintained and staff is very rude and unwilling to take responsibility for anything."
5,807,"Dec 17 2008 	if size does not matter!!!	it is an apart hotel by Best Western Premier Shaftesbury Kensington. I stayed in 613 for 5 nights. The room size is just about right, very clean, well decorated. The hotel is located 200 metres to Earl's Court tube station. You can have a very easy axcess to the sights. You have the breakfast room in the main hotel building. Orange juice, cheese, eegs,honey, jam,toasted bread ext plenty.Free internet is avaiable only via cable, no wireless in the rooms. Staff is very polite. No Problems. Around the hotel many restaurants of every kind."
6,807,"Nov 18 2008 	Nice Suprise!	What a nice Surprise. We made the booking for this hotel through the London Premier Hotels website and paid 116.33 in total which was less than half the rack rate. We were lead to believe the nearest tube station was Gloucester Road, don't be fooled!!!!! the nearest station is Earls Court, a couple of minutes walk away. The hotel is located in a nice quiet location with every possible restaurant, take away, pub and bar within very easy walking distance. We choose this hotel as we were going to see the Good Food Show at Olympia which is ideal, one stop away on the tube from Earls Court. We booked a Deluxe Room which included lots of extra, such as loads of toileties, robes, slippers, a bottle of wine (on request but we were not charged for!) and a microwave. The breakfast was included in the price, very fresh, actually hot and the staff, well lets just say they had character! The gentleman overseeing the breakfast sitting was extremely friendly and could not do enough for anyone. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and when I searched for this hotel on TripAdvisor it seems to be the wrong one, so I have started up a new review so there's is no mix up ....."
7,807,Oct 18 2008 	Good Value	Despite some reservations about the place over reviews posted my wife and I had a most enjoyable stay at this hotel recently.It's location is superb-just three mins walk from Earls Court Tube Station and ten mins walk to Kensington High St.The hotel has undergone substantial refurbishment and the rooms are quite comfortable if a little on the small side.The bathrooom in particular was quite superb and spotlessly clean.We were able to check in and access our room on arrival at 11am which was a bonus.Staff were professional and helpful.Even though the hotel website specified the hotel did not have a bar it was nonetheless possible to obtain alcohol on the premises as they offered &quot;happy hour special cocktails&quot;.Located in a quiet street our room was street facing but we experienced no street noise whatsoever during night time.This hotel offers superb value for money and I will definitely stay there again.
8,807,"May 30 2008 	What a gem!	Small room (normal for London) but for 65 pounds on laterooms very good value for money- 3 min walk from Earls Court tube station, brand new room decor Italian like the Bellagio in Las Vegas, proper air-conditioning, v. comfortable bed, fridge and microwave, Broadband internet complimentary, flatscreen TV, state of the art bathroom. Room was very quiet, dark curtains block out the light completely which was good for us because we needed our sleep.We checked in at the Shaftesbury, very efficient, saw complimentary newspapers, chocolates and apples at reception which was a nice touch.Only negative was maybe the shower which was a bit slow, but not enough to make me not recommend this place. Try it before the prices go up!"
1,809,"Aug 15 2009 	Good budget hotel - location a little remote	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my husband who stays here most weeks. As you would expect it is fairly basic but reasonably priced for greater London. The rooms are small and would be ideal for single people but they become a little cramped for two over a number of nights. There are a limited number of hangers so for two people who are both working this was a problem. The beds are not particularly comfortable and the towels are in need of replacement as they are very thin and grey. Don't expect a full English breakfast but the options available are ideal for a quick breakfast. As it is next to Sainsbury's there is the option of buying sandwiches, salads and takeaway hot food. Walthamstow has a very large number of fast food/takeaway options although we have not tried any. Chingford is easily reached by bus - and there are some fabulous eating places here. The tapas bar and Thai restaurant are both next to Chingford station and are good. Commuting to London takes about an hour - from the hotel it is a bus and tube on the Victoria Line."
2,809,"Jun 30 2009 	Great place from which to base	I stayed here several times over several months. The staff from the top person to the clerks are friendly and courteous, particularly for a middle market hotel. The dog track is now gone, but this place is within easy walking of parks, tennis courts, restaurants, laundry and other shops. The rooms are typical HIE, which are not all the comfortable. But we have continually found that the quality of staff and their willingness to help made it a great place to base one's business travel to London. Just catch a cab to Walthamstow to catch the Tube, or a mini-Cab to City Airport. Not too bad."
3,809,"Feb 5 2009 	Free parking a plus	I needed a hotel for one night, for a family of four, with breakfast and free parking. I also needed to do several things over s short period and therefore I needed a handy location.This hotel fitted the bill. I have stayed in HI Express hotels before and knew I would get a comfortable room, fast check in, decent self service buffet breakfast. The free parking was a plus point, rival hotels wanted up to 15 per night.There is a Sainsbury's in the same location and along Chingford Road you will find takeaways. Its just off the North Circular but my sat nav was confused as it thought the hotel was on the North Circular Rd. This is why I mention the Sainsbury's as you need to get off the junction nearby.Its a great location if you have a car as it was no more than 10 miles away to places I needed to go in my short visit to London."
4,809,"Nov 23 2008 	Excellent Stay at HI Express	Stayed a Saturday night at the end of November whilst visiting friends. The room was booked through the Holiday Inn Express website for a rate of 49, very good value for money. There is easy access via public transport, plenty of buses connecting to tube and rail stations nearby as well as good access from the A406 and M25 if you are driving. Public areas were clean and tidy, as was my bedroom. Only slight complaint would be that the carpet was a little threadbare in places. Nice bright lighting in the room and no noise issues from the North Circular! Sadly Walthamstow dogs has shut down but there is plenty to do in nearby Chingford at night. If you like Chinese food head to Chongs just opposite Chingford Station(10 mins away by bus). All you can eat restaurant with a twist... it is not a buffet, everything is cooked to order and is of excellent quality. Back to the hotel, staff were friendly and polite when I had contact with them, wireless internet for a charge, vending machines for drinks etc, and Sainsburys just round the corner. Overall great value for money and convenient location. Will definitely stay there again in the future."
5,809,"Feb 29 2008	Great Little Hotel	I've stayed here about 5 times now in recent years, in fact any time that I'm heading home to Walthamstow I don't even entertain anywhere else.The rooms are clean, the staff are courteous, prices are low (for london) breakfast is included and considering the area and location security is very good.For anyone looking for a base in the greater London area you coudl do far far worse than consider the HIE, not only have you got an East London institute over the road in the form of Walthamstow Dogs, but transport links are excellent and your'e only 30 mins on the tube from central London.Try Walthamstow market it is excellent, over mile long and full of excellent stalls selling a huge range of multi cultural goods"
6,809,"Feb 21 2008	Blackpool tourist	This is the second time we have stayed here - this time for 4 nights. A nice clean place, everything you could wish for at a budget hotel.This is not Central London, but that is about an hour away by bus and train. This hotel offers free parking, is not within the congestion charging zone, so is a good place to drive to, leave the car, and see the sights on public transport.There is a huge greyhound racing stadium oppisite - if you go, pre-book their &quot;six pack&quot; which offers admission, food, drinks, and a couple of 1 bets for a fixed price."
7,809,"Aug 22 2007 	Functional	Have stayed here a couple of times and have found it to be a typical HIE with reasonable standards. It's very close to the dog racing venue so would be an excellent choice if one was contemplating a dogs/hotel night. It's also adjacent to the north circular and appears to be planted in a corner of a large supermarket (Sainbury's) car park.There does seem to be some engine noise at the rear, refrigerated lorries perhaps, so a room at the front is better.On a few occassions, I have had to leave before 6am and have found myself unable to get out as the door is locked and the night staff have vanished. They can be unfriendly, which is in contrast to the day staff who I've always found rather pleasant.Surrounding area has nothing, unless you're there for the dogs. The nearest underground is miles away."
8,809,Jul 25 2007 	Dirty Room well bellow holiday inns normal standard	Bed room was not very well cleaned stayed for two days and hairs in the bath room from the previous ocupant when i was there pest control was checking the room Bed Bug? Breakfast was very bussy used by a lot of Coach parties. One to avoid if you want a clean room or some were to sit for breakfast
9,809,Jun 16 2007 	Dog racing delight	Located on the North Circular but well glazed!Great bar with very friendly staff who make for a good atmosphere. Located right by Walthamstow dog track so great entertainment if you are a solo business traveller (1 entry on a Tuesday!)Right next to a Sainsburys &amp; the take away Indians that deliver to the hotel are good.
10,809,"Mar 20 2007 	Great hotel great price	Have styaed at this hotel a few times now. Its a modern hotel on the outskirts of London. The nearest tube station is about 10 mins bus ride away - there is a bus station very near the hotel. The tube into London only takes about 20 mins and you can use your one day rail card for the bus as well! Dispite being very close to the a very busy road, the hotel was quite. Rooms were clean, tidy and well furnished. I would say that the double beds are a bit small. We now opt for a twin room!The rack rate for this hotel is something like 160 per night. You can get it from time to time for 39 per night, per room inc cont. breakfast. Thats a great price for a nights stay in London.I would stay here again."
11,809,Mar 7 2007	A lovely relaxing stay!	I booked this hotel as a gift for my partner with the sole purpose of the trip being the greyhound track in walthamstow.. it is literally right across the road!! There are no more hotels in the area and this one is more than enough..Expected exactly what i got from the holiday inn standard! Clean comfortable rooms. Read a couple of reviews before i left and the only negative point anyone mentioned was that it is out of london. Yes this is true however it is a very relaxed hotel with the bus stop across the road that will carry you to the Selbourne walk shopping centre (has all your high street shops) and the markets outside if you feel the need for shopping. There are a few nice restaurants in walthamstow. Other than that the area does'nt offer much else. However we really enjoyed our 3 night stay in the hotel!!
12,809,"Sep 25 2006 	A pleasant change - a nice London hotel!	We stay in London a lot on visits to family and friends, but rarely at Holiday Inn. However, there was a special offer on which meant we paid 39 per room per night including breakfast for two of us and a toddler which seemed a pretty good deal.Our room was fine - it was clean - adequate provisions - and the bed settee was already made up so when we arrived at midnight it was easy to transfer little one straight into bed. Parking was plentiful and free which was nice as lots of London hotels charge for that on top.The bar was open late, and I was even able to get a sandwich at 1.15 am when I was hungry.Breakfast was more than adequate with complimentary newspapers provided.I used to live close by this hotel, so do know the area very well. A great night out can be had at the dog stadium opposite, Walthamstow shops and Market are a short drive away (don't forget your pie 'n mash if you are in East London!) and there is an Ikea within walking distance if you feel so inclined.... The hotel is on a slip road off the North Circ, so you get easy driving access but it is not overly noisy with traffic and we slept with the window open. It is also a few minutes from the bottom of the M11 - so lots of places are in reach.I am usually the first to find fault with lots of the hotels we use for weekends (usually one a month) but I could honestly find nothing to gripe about with this one. Even the staff were pleasant and friendly - a cleaner ran after our little boy to give him a balloon someone had left in their room.An absolute gem, and we will stay there again. I was almost tempted not to write this up in case everyone now books it and we can't get reservations next time we go!"
13,809,Jul 6 2006	don't expect central london	This hotel is in a surburb of London - the nearest tube station is walthamstow central which is a 10 mins bus ride. This station is in zone 3 - travel into Oxford circus about 40 mins. It's on a main road and in Sainsbury's car park. the only hoighlight is the walthamstow Dog racing track opposite which is a real East London treat. The market in Walthamstow is over a mile long- the longest in Europe - which is very multi cultural and sells everything at bargain prices !
14,809,"Jun 18 2006	Too far out (June 6-8)	The hotel itself was nice enough. We needed a room big enough for our family of four, but affordable as well. This hotel fit the bill, literally. It was nearly impossible to find one room for four in central London at a reasonable price. We booked this online and didn't do enough research. If we had realized that we were not walking distance to the tube, we probably would have opted for a different spot. We spent most of our three days in London riding city buses to and from the Walthamstow Central station and on the tube into London. Like I said, the price was right, but when I go to London again, I think I'll actually cough up the extra money to stay in London."
15,809,"Apr 29 2006	Great Stay!	I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing to be near London, but not to pay their prices. You would of thought that this hotel was family run, everyone works so well together and they are so helpful!I agree with the other person on here, I have stayed several times now as it's so friendly.My only wish would be an English breakfast, however the selection on offer is adequate."
16,809,"Jun 6 2005	Recommended Hotel	Rather than stay in the centre of London and be ripped off, we decided to stay at the Holiday Inn at Walthamstow in North London. It had great access, located just off the North Circular Road, which was perfect! Their was a Sainsbury supermarket round the corner and we got a tube up the road at Highams Park Station straight into the centre of London in about 15mins! It was cheap, the breakfast was fine, the rooms were standard Holiday Inn in excellent condition and no, I am not employed by them as PR guru - I just have to give credit where its due! So good, I have now stayed there 3 times!"
17,809,Nov 23 2009 	Bom hotel longe de londres
1,813,"Nov 16 2009 	Simple clean in a convenient position	Stayed for one night when down to see a show at Television Centre. This hotel was a 10 minutes walk to Hammersmith tube and then only a further 10 minutes by tube to the BBC. There was a room available when we checked in early and the staff were friendly and helpful. Room surprisingly spacious, we stayed in a guest house the previous night in another British city in which a cat could not have been swung easily! Bathroom clean with a great hot and powerful shower. Breakfast was basic but adequate. Would stay again."
2,813,"Oct 20 2009 	would do again	close to hammersmith tube station, very clean, very good service, breakfast continental.rooms rather on the smallish side but ok for a weekend."
3,813,"Oct 14 2009 	Good value and quality	Clean, modern hotel. Convenient location to tube station. Walking distance to pubs on the river.Our room was clean and comfortable. Not noisy at all.Good continental breakfast buffet. Wetherspoon's pub next door for very low priced meals."
4,813,"Sep 7 2009	Excellent	I recomend this hotel - very good value, staff were excellent and extremely polite. The hotel was very close to Hammersmith Tube so was easy to get around London and very near bus stops too which was handy. My mother and I shared a twin room. We thoroughly enjoyed our continental breakfast. Great shower and bathroom All very very good! Even managed to get my car parked in their car park for 12 overnight. Bargain. Would definately stay there again when I go back in a couple of months."
5,813,"Aug 17 2009 	A reasonable city hotel for a short break	This is the second time that my wife and I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Hammersmith when visiting London to see West End shows. Hammersmith may seem a bit of a way out, but it is only about 15 to 20 minutes on the tube to Piccadilly Circus, although the hotel is then about 10 minutes on foot from Hammersmith station. It is situated up its own dead end side road and is mostly above the local Wetherspoons pub, the Plough &amp; Harrow, which has the usual value for money drinks and pub grub. The hotel appears to be a fairly new build stretching back behind the faade of an original building fronting onto the road. It has bog standard HI Express rooms  modern rooms slightly on the small side but with interior fixtures and fittings that seem to be designed to make it feel a bit bigger, including the use of light wood effect furniture. The inclusion of just a shower room ensuite also gives a bit more space in the room. If you're driving, the hotel has its own parking garage where you can leave your car for about 12 a day, which seems like a lot, but you can pay much more in London.It sounds like some other guests have been unlucky with plumbing issues but on both occasions we stayed we had no such trouble. The windows only seem to open a fraction, presumably for safety and security reasons and although there is no in-room air conditioning as such, Im sure that despite the sudden May heat wave, we managed to cool the room down with the blower above the door on a low setting. The complimentary continental breakfast is fine to start the day, but you have to accept its limitations. On both occasions our room was spotlessly clean, so we have no grumbles with the hotel itself.However, as the hotel is situated between the main road to the front and tube tracks to the back, we suspect that some rooms will get more road noise than others and some will get more train noise. On both times we stayed we were on the side above the entrance and last time we were directly above Wetherspoons side entrance, which surprisingly perhaps in UK 2009 we did not find to be a rowdy venue. We suffered relatively little road or rail noise but like others, we were subjected to the very early morning rubbish truck and subsequently, by a number of delivery trucks all of which were enough to wake the dead. So, no lie-ins at this hotel for many guests.One thing we did find is that just a short walk along Macbeth St opposite the hotel and under the busy A4 Great West Road by subway, youre in a park that leads onto to a fantastic Thames river path. There are a number of lovely pubs here where you can have a fine meal and a drink and watch the comings and goings on the river, especially the oarsmen and women. Sitting there by the river in the sunshine, it actually felt like we were far out in the countryside, not just a stones throw from Central London. If you fancy going to see a film, there is small multi screen cinema about 100 yards up King Street which was quite acceptable.City hotels can be quite noisy. Accept this hotel for what it is, have some cotton wool ready for ear plugs if needed and, based on what others have written, hope you dont get the plumbing problems, then HI Express Hammersmith could do the job nicely for a couple of nights."
6,813,"Aug 14 2009 	clean but extreamley noisy	we stayed in a room just above weatherspoons pub, when we booked the hotel we didnt realise the hotel was over a pub, room was very clean, but very noisy at night, people were outside smoking until 12 o clock at night, the last night we stayed we were woke up at 5 am in the morning by refuse collectors, then a bit later on bottle collectors, then a delivery we think to the pub, My Daughter and her husband stayed in the Hotel aswell but there room was at the other end of the hotel , they didnt here any noise at all ,my advise dont book a room over the weatherspoons pub."
7,813,Aug 4 2009 	Terribly noisy night in the family room	We enjoyed the facilities of the hotel and the breakfast. The staff were very helpful. The one night we stayed however was extremely noisy. Wetherspoons is situated beneath the hotel and was noisy till after midnight. Around 4 in the morning the refuse collection was made and the noise of banging bins and reversing alarm seemed to be in the same room and woke us all. Then again about an hour later the beer delivery - beer barrels clanging for 15 minutes or so. Our meetings the following day were not easy as we were all so jaded.
8,813,"Jul 30 2009 	Beware of Smelly Shower Drains/Odours	Spent two nights at this hotel which isnt outstanding, but apart from our unlucky experience, does what it says on the tin! (breakfast is cold buffet type but adequate) However, we had an unfortunate experience with one of our rooms. (The plumbing leaves alot to be desired, with effluent/drains backing up into the shower cubicle after it had been raining) I was in bed as it was quite late but went to my daughters room after she phoned to say about the problem. Her room was filled with a most sickening/ disgusting smell and the shower base was covered in a horrible brown liquid, which had come up through the plug hole. The windows hardly opened to let in any fresh air, and it was too much for anyone to take. We phoned for assistance and they sent a man with a 'cloth and a bottle of disinfectant' who rinsed down the shower cubicle, which was totally inadequate for the situation. I insisted on changing rooms as my two children could hardly breath from the mixture of drains and chemicals, but was told by the duty manager that he couldnt move them and the smell wasn't 'so bad'.After arguing that this was a health and safety issue, and my children were not staying in the room, another one was found with a promise of compensation in the morning. ( this was now getting on for midnight) However, as next day there was no record of these events, the day manager after much arguing offered a 20 refund off the bill. To cut this saga shorter. It has taken several days of arguing with this hotel chain ( really only because of their lack of concern) and they agreed to refund 50. Yet, still no proper apology.The whole experience spoiled what should have been an enjoyable time for the family for our days in London. . We accept that things can go wrong, but you dont expect a total lack of concern and indifference., nor should you have to argue and fight for compensation over this sort of a problem. No other complaints regarding the stay, but I am very disappointed.I have also spotted that other previous guests of this hotel have noted in their reviews 'smelly drains and room odours'."
9,813,"Jul 25 2009 	For the price I couldn't have asked for anything more	If it was only the location for the Holiday Inn Express Hammersmith it would be a great review but my stay was much more than this. After a booking company in London blew my weeklong booking, and after searching London for replacement accommodations through Trip Advisor I made this booking. I arrived early in the morning and they were able to put me into my room, plus offered me the fabulous continental breakfast that is included every morning. It was a hot and steamy week, and the airconditioning was a welcome relief. My room was clean, included all that was promised. My checkout was smooth as silk. As others did I used the most reasonable internet cafe just down the street (turn right on King and its a 1 minute walk. The tube was close by in either direction, and got me to both the business and tourist locations I needed...easily. Unfortunately tho' the tube isn't airconditioned, and while I was there it was a sweat box. Didn't look in to above ground bus transportation but the Hammersmith Station is also a bus depot so you probably can get downtown easily by bus as well. Don't hesitate to stay at the Holiday Inn Express Hammersmith."
10,813,"Jul 12 2009 	excellent hotel 	we stayed in a family room for 3 nights and found it to be up to the usual holiday inn express standards. rooms modern &amp; well presented, maided daily and very clean. breakfast was continental eat-as-much-as-you-like and very adequate. staff friendly &amp; helpful, free luggage store if you arrive early or wish to leave upon departure. next door to Weatherpoons so great for good value meals, drinks, etc. lots of other restaurants, shops, etc. in the area. short walk to riverside with lovely walk along the Thames (into city centre if you are fit enough!). close to Hammersmith Apollo for gigs, and not far from Earls Court, Olympia and Fulham football ground. tube/underground about 10 mins walk to either lines and plenty of buses along the high street. diverse area with many cultures. great spot for visiting london would highly recommend."
11,813,"Jul 2 2009 	New Clean Hotel in Interesting Area	I chose this hotel for its price and ammenities. The rooms are a decent size (I had a double bed, for one person this was fine) and everything is new. The rooms have air conditioning which is very lucky as I was here during a heat wave, so I was comfortable. Nice large bathrooms and rather spacious room compared to other London hotels. Staff was mixed, some very friendly, others not at all. The best thing about the hotel is its proximity to some excellent restaurants, shopping, and other ammenities. There is a buffett breakfast and a bar, but no room service or restaurant on site but there's so much in the area, it's easy to stay well fed on a range of budgets. One thing that bothered me was that even with the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door, the maids would knock, loudly. I complained and eventually they stopped."
12,813,"Jun 6 2009 	Good hotel for London vacation	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at Hammersmith for 6 nights starting May 24th. Check in was quick. We arrived from the US at about 8.30am and were informed that our room would be ready by 2pm. They offered to keep our bags in a locked baggage room, which was great. We had some snacks with us, so we decided to eat something before we went to central London, and they were most welcoming in letting us eat the continental breakfast being served at the time.Overall, our stay was comfortable. The staff was quite friendly and very helpful. Housekeeping was also good, we returned each night to a clean room. Breakfast is the usual, as others have already described. Great coffee machine. Staff seemed a bit over-whelmed during breakfast on certain days, however, overall, breakfast was plentiful.Parking is very limited, but it was not a concern for us as we did not have a car.Walk to Tube: We used the Hammersmith station everyday. With 2 young kids, the walk was about 8-10 minutes, without them we could have done it a bit faster. Along the way are several restaurants, pubs, shops and a big mall. It was busy during the morning, and no matter what time we returned, once as late as midnight, it alwasy felt very safe.Hammersmith station itself was great, lots of stores, the District and Circle lines are both available. The Tube is an amazing thing: clean, fast, convenient, cheap. Londoners are lucky! Having 2 lines run through Hammersmith made it quick and easy to get anywhere, most of the time without having to change trains. I found it very convenient.We did 'takeaway' or takeout as we say here on some nights, and the hotel has a microwave and some dishes/silverware one can use. They also have an ice machine. Makes meals much more affordable as there is a large Sainsbury's in Kings Mall, about 5 mins away on King St, so one could buy frozen/cold dinner and heat and eat at the hotel. The room was basic, well designed and had all the amenities one would expect at a basic hotel. It was a tight fit for a family of 4, but we expected that. We did not have lots of luggage, which helped. Bathroom was very well designed, although the shower temp seemed to change randomly, which freaked the kids out. I was afraid there would be no counter space in the bathroom, but surprisingly, there was enough space to fit our stuff. It's not a five star by any means, but it is clean, functional and comfortable.To sum up, I would stay here again if I'm lucky enough to re-visit London. I thought the location in zone 2 was good for tube connections, stores, restaurants, grocery stores etc. Central London and all it's attratctions were only 20-30 minutes away. Staff was very friendly and helpful, which always makes a big difference to me. And paying only 55 a night, I thought it was an awesome deal."
13,813,"Jun 6 2009 	They've got hoteling down to a science!	We got married at the Town Hall, then came here for our wedding night. The room was small, but very comfortable. It was very clean and the important things -- bed and shower -- were top notch. Clean cumfy white duvet, and clean hot shower with lots of water pressure. One draw back was a strong smell of drains in the room. However, when we complained about this to the staff we got a free nights stay. Staff was overly helpful and friendly and sorted it immediately. Would love to stay again."
14,813,"Jun 3 2009 	Good for Business trips	The Holiday Inn - Express hotel at Hammersmith is a good budget hotel for any international traveler. Ideal location and well connected to the London city zones, it is one of the best hotel to stay &amp; spend the business trip or even if you are on vacation with family. The hotel has a spacious reception area with smiling &amp; helpful staff. The rooms are very clean and well appointed. The rooms are secured and have all the necessary amenities a traveler would want. The house-keeping service ensures the rooms are kept clean &amp; in order. The beds are large and very comfortable and the flooring has carpets, but its not smelly. There is a coffee machine in each room and the property has designated no-smoking and smoking rooms. The washroom is well designed and has a tub and powerful shower. Overall the room has everything one needs to make their stay comfortable and one cannot ask for more!The restaurant is a open place near the lobby, but serves a only cold breakfast (no hot serves). The light breakfast starts your day perfectly well!The staff is very cordial and helpful and they ensure that your stay is full of comfort. I would recommend this hotel to all travelling to London and if you are on a budget."
15,813,"May 24 2009 	Excellent Hotel Value For Money and very Clean	My daughter and i stayed at this hotel from friday the 15th May till sunday the 17th May 09.Having travelled for 10 hours by coach from Scotland, we just wanted to get to the hotel and relax. We travelled on the Circle Line to Hammersmith from Victoria which was only 6 stops and took approximately 20 mins, from the station it was a 10 min walk to the hotel. Check in at the hotel was great staff were extremely friendly. Hotel room was number 315 on the 3rd floor and i have to say we were pleasantly surprised, plenty of room for mum and teenage daughter. Overall the room was very clean also bathroom was immaculate. Continental Breakfast was more than adequate to set u up for the day. Staff were very helpfull, so to sum it up if you need a decent hotel not to far away from central london then i would highly reccommend the Holiday Inn Express, Hammersmith. Will deff be back."
16,813,May 13 2009 	allright but not the best	needed to stay somewhere close to hammersminth because of my exam centre being nearby. this was the cheapest and closest option available. everythinng over here is allright but nothing to write home about
17,813,"Apr 16 2009 	An average hotel but no major complaints	We booked this hotel mainly because we were going to a concert at Shepherds Bush so the location for that is ideal. For travellers visiting as a base for Central London then it may be a little far out. However, it is very near to three major tube lines that you can use to get to where you need to. We went into Central London every day and did not have to change once.I would say that the hotel was below average compared to other Holiday Inn/Express that I have stayed in. Our room was extremely small for a family room and very cramped. However, as a double room it would have been fine.Breakfast was ok - nothing to complain about other than it can get extremely busy - get there early."
18,813,"Apr 13 2009 	we liked it	Typical HI Express - does what it says on the tin. Good value, breakfast included, small but comfy rooms. Yes breakfast was busy but it was the school hols so to be expected around 8.30 I suppose. Staff friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend that anyone staying at this hotel use Ravenscourt Park tube (District Line) rather that Hammersmith as it's way nearer the hotel by my calculations but still in zone 2. We also used the car park, we had no problems getting the car in, 12 per night."
19,813,"Apr 11 2009 	It's o.k	On arrival we were met with a polite member of staff and quickly checked in to room 215. The hotel roms are really small,We booked a room with a sleeper sofa so you have a bit more room to manouvere. The room was clean and tidy as was the whole hotel . our room overlooked a private office car park,so it was quiet.Take a travel iron with you as there is no iron/boards in the rooms only available from reception,which is silly for the 21st century!The desk lamp didn't work neither did the standard lamp on the wall,whcih is no prblem. The window lever was loose so we couldnt close the window tight. there was a light on the wall by the main door with no cover on it,so the wire was visible,not a prblem unless you touched it I suppose! We went for breakfast on the 1st morning and they ran out of plates,no problem,we waited for about 10mins for more to arrive and when we went up to get some,they had run out for a second time!The second morning there was no room to sit for breakfast! no enough seats/tables. There is a wetherspoons pub next door where you can get a breakfast for 3,also has cheap drinks. I did try the hotel bar and my pint was watered down I was tempted to ask ' surely you get a gold fish with this?' :)There are complimentary newspapers available in the lobby.The staff that I spoke to around the hotel were always polite and pleasant.How to get there: There are 2 ways by the tube: We came in by the London Underground from Paddington Station .You come in on the Hammersmith line(pink in colour on tube map) approx 15mins journey.There are 2 tube staions in Hammersmith both opposite each other. Hammersmith line and the District /Circle line(blue in colour on tube map) when you come out of the tube from paddington ,cross the road on,take the first right by the LLoyds no1 bar (you can see this opposite you, if you come in on the District and Cirlce line),follow the road for about 10mins you'll see the Wetherspoons pub called 'The Plough And Arrow',take a right there walk along the road toward the hotel car park and on the right there are steps leading into the hotel.Depending on where you want to visit,we used the District and circle line from Hammersmith as it was easier to get connecting trains to places."
20,813,"Mar 22 2009 	Excellent...	We stayed there for five nights during New Year's Eve. Excellent hotel, good location (underground station and bus station nearby), nice and quiet rooms, friendly stuff, very nice breakfast. The Picadilly line takes you to the centre at no time. Very good for families with children. We would definitely stay there again."
21,813,"Mar 19 2009 	Excellent stay. Typical Holiday Inn Express	Having first stayed late last year at the Holiday Inn Express in Hull we was hoping that this one would live up to that, and we wasn't disappointed.Location is excellent, around a 5 minutes walk to Ravenscourt Tube on the district line and 10 minutes to Hammersmith Central and piccadilly tube lines.The hotel was of the same standard as the one in Hull, clean, tidy and of good decor and noise was never a problem even though the hotel was above a wetherspoons (handy for cheap drink and food).We found the staff friendly, the breakfast perfectly fine and the location excellent. Takes around 14 to 16 minutes to get into central london on the tube and there are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars in the area.Area was perfectly safe and not as crowded as central london.Highly recommended and we are looking to book here again in August."
22,813,"Feb 24 2009 	A great stay great location.... pity about the Housekeeping!!!	Our room was not cleaned before 4pm on any of the days we were there. On the first day i opened the bed to find foreign looking hairs on the bedsheet and had to call reception 3 times for a change of bedsheets. Our bath towels were removed and not replaced. Our bathroom was not cleaned once during our 4 days stay. Housekeeping was not attentive at all and not very helpful. The rooms we basic and comfortable. Walls are very thin so were very often woken up or dusturbed by neighbours opening and closing doors, etc. Breakfast was great...wide selection. A great stay overall, pity about the Housekeeping. Great central location with restaurants and High Street shopping very close by."
23,813,"Feb 14 2009 	Good value	Although this is not the Dorchester it is very good value for London. We paid just over 300 pounds for five nights, not bad for a hotel in London. Included in that was breakfast, which was continential but good. The rooms were clean and a bit on the small side but this is what you pay for. The bed was soft, the shower good and the heating worked when needed. The towels in the bathroom were a little on the flimsy side and need to be upgraded. Check in was good as were the front of house staff. We had room 417 which was a little noisey with bins being emptied at 5 in the morning, if I were to go again I would get a room on the other side of the corridor. Only real complaint was the very high price for the internet, over 6 pounds per hour, a bit of a rip off when you consider the pub next door had WiFi for free. I think in this age no hotel should be charging such a steep price for internet connection. Overall this hotel is worth the money and had good connections to the centre of London and easy access to Heathrow."
24,813,"Dec 3 2008 	Clean cheap and convenient	I turned up on spec at 9.30pm at the Express Holiday Inn after the Novotel told me they had cancelled my booking - our travel dept had tried to use an out of date credit card. Novotel didn't inform me of this, so I was stuck without a room as they were fully booked. A local taxi driver pointed me to the Express and I'm very grateful he did. I had a warm welcome, and they even knocked 20 the room for a late booking! Room was spacious, clean and had everything you'd expect. Good sized bathroom, spotlessly clean.Only minor gripe was it was a little noisy, what with being in the centre of Hammersmith, so there was traffic noise and bins being emptied late at night.Breakfast was included in the price, and was fine for a budget hotel, a help yourself continental buffet.All in all an excellent stay, costing just over half what I would have paid up the road at the Novotel (who have henceforth lost my custom)."
25,813,"Oct 23 2008 	Friendly Staff 	Nice clean and tidy room, as also the hotel is. Great location for central London. Breakfast was a basic but convenient continental style buffet"
26,813,Oct 22 2008 	Nice hotel	Stayed here for one night whilst visiting Hammersmith for a concert. Nice clean and quiet hotel. Not far up King Street so very convenient for the Apollo. Room price included continental breakfast. Would visit again.
27,813,"Oct 9 2008 	Convenient clean and comfortable	This was my first stay the this Express by Holiday inn which was recommentded by a business colleague for use when working in the West London area.Located on Hammersmith's main shopping street, King St, this property is a little odd in that the entrance is located down a side street and the hotel extends over a public house building which fronts onto King St. If you're a light sleeper I'd recommend asking for a quiet room at the rear.The lobby &amp; breakfast area is apparantly about to be modernised from it's 1990's typical Holiday Inn Express look but was otherwise clean and well presented. The staff were polite and helpful, too.The rooms have already been updated, and featured the now customary yellow / orange / blue hues. The room was spotless, quiet, warm and had the most comofrtable bed I've experienced in a hotel in a long time, with a nice 'fluffy' duvet. The only downside were the thin and grey-ish towels in the bathroom - they could do with buying some new ones.The free continental breakfast was OK - a reasonable range and again spotlessly clean surroundings.Very handy for the Tube (Hammersmith is about 5 minutes walk and Ravenscourt Park even closer) and there are excellent bus services right outside, with access to trendy and upmarket Chiswick High Rd for restaurants, bars etc in about 5 minutes or so.Worth considering - whilst not in the worst part of town, it's not necessarily the most attractive area of London if you're a tourist."
28,813,"Aug 28 2008 	Very good clean value hotel.	The hotel is very close to the tube, shops, etc and the theatres. It is also only 20 mins to central London direct on the Picadilly line, so very easy. We stayed with our two children aged 4 and 5 and the room was clean and modern, with a fairly large bathroom. The rooms were well insulated. The staff were polite and effecient. The breakfast on Sunday morning was again, very nicely presented and well organised. We were quite early though...before the swarm of other guests were there when we checked out at around 9.45. Best of all it only cost us 75 including breakfast for all 4 of us after searching for the best deals on-line. I would stay again, especially for the nearby theatre, but also just for a weekend in London."
29,813,"Aug 25 2008	decent accommodations outrageous wifi fee	I stayed here for two nights while attending a conference at the Novotel down the street.Although I might not recommend this location for sightseeing in London, I found it to be quite convenient for a quick conference visit. Anything you might need is readily available in the nearby shops, and I had some excellent kebabs and Indian food. Just a quarter-mile away is a great running path that winds along the river. The numerous tube lines at Hammersmith station make getting to Heathrow and the train stations simple and inexpensive.My room was cozy but clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was generous and tasty.The fee for wifi, however, was bordering on obscene: 25 pounds (50 USD) per day. The place is already a little pricey given the out-of-the-way location and rather basic amenities. (I paid 144 pounds per night.) Do they really need to charge $50 a day for something that is basically free to provide? What kind of person stays at a Holiday Inn *Express* and has an extra $50 for internet access?The room was decent, and the location was convenient for me, but that wifi fee was unacceptable. I have to agree with the other reviewer who said to stay at the Novotel if you need to stay in the neighborhood. It's nicer, the rates are comparable, and, according to my colleagues who stayed there, they charge less for wifi."
30,813,"Aug 12 2008 	Great Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend Theatre trip in London. The hotel is located almost in the middle of Hammersmith High Street. Within a few minutes walk from the hotel you have all kinds of shops, takeways and even a shopping centre.Its a 5 minute walk to Hammersmith Tube station that can get you in the centre of London in about 15 mins. The hotel itself is quite new, clean and safe. The rooms are a little on the small side, but this is the only negative point. The room has AC which was great, clean nice bathroom and great power shower.My only negative comment was the buffet continental brekfast was always so busy, its a bit of a &quot;free for all&quot; tripping over people etc.If you cross the road and walk away from the hotel you walk to the river (under the A4) where you have lovely walks and some nice pubs.This will be where we stay whenever we visit London on a budget, its also handy for Heathrow (mid way between the airport and central London)."
31,813,"Jul 20 2008 	Good value option	Did a short trip to London, and found this place to be very good value. Clean room, well located, adequate facilities and inexpensive - good for London."
32,813,"Jun 24 2008 	Good value business hotel for London	Spent a couple of nights there for business, room was fine, they have a breakfast bar which is also free and there is a Wetherspoons literally next door if you want a more substantial breakfast!Not a bad area with some decent pubs and good restaurants (notably the Vietnamese - Saigon Saigon).Staff also good, turned up at 9:30 hoping to drop bag and they gave me an early check-in."
33,813,"Jun 17 2008	My Favourite Place in England	I was hard pressed to have a weekend off and I found this delightful hotel - Express Holiday Inn - in Hammersmith London and I booked an overnight stay at a reasonable cost quite by chance.Since then I have stayed on a number of occasions, at Express Holiday Inn in Hammersmith and I always receive a warm welcome and an excellent breakfast which comes with my room at this exquisite hotel close to London Heathrow Airport. I am always pleased with the Business - Communications and Computing facilities as I generally have managed to get all business calls completed with outstanding results recently ... great stay at Express Holiday Inn in Hammersmith London England!"
34,813,"Mar 31 2008 	Good location.	The hubby and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Room was clean and styled like every other Holiday Inn Express in the UK. Breakfast in the morning was good and even when we strolled down at 9.30, there was still plenty there. This hotel is 5 to 10 mins walk from Hammersmith underground. There are a few pubs and eating establishments round about the hotel. There is also lots of shops ....... just in case you have forgotten something."
35,813,"Mar 30 2008	Good and clean	Good functional hotel, clean and good food. Reasonable prices for London and not far from tube."
36,813,"Feb 29 2008 	good value	I had to stay close to Hammersmith for business reasons.Considering the prices of London, this Holiday Inn is not bad (119 GBP internet rate). It is fairly new and still look well kept. Bathrooms and elevators are modern and functioning.It is 10 minutes far away (walking distance) from Hammersmith Tube station and it is very easy to reach. In spite of the closeness to the main road, it's in a somewhat quiet area, a shorter side street with parking.Check in and personnel assistance is decent enough considering it's a sort of 2-3 star hotel.The room is of the size you'd find in a Ibis or another Holiday Inn, plus with necessaire to have a cup of tea.Shower pressure is very good and the room is quite comfortable.No complaints about breakfast either but it's an area so full of every fastfood/restaurants/cafes that you will find whatever suits your needs.I have no complaints and I found this place to be a good deal for the area."
37,813,"Feb 9 2008	Nice UK hotel	We stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving 2007. It is a little bit out of the way but it is close to the train stations. The price is okay for a UK hotel like this. We stayed for 4 nights for GBP506. The room was clean and the facilities were modern. There was no free internet. However, they provide free continental breakfast. They also have a microwave oven, dishes and cutlery in the lobby for the hotel guests. One nice thing about this place is its proximity to supermarkets. There is a Marks &amp; Spencer down the street and they sell pre-packaged reheatable meals. One word of caution though. The train from Hammersmith or Olympia do not start to run until about 8 AM on Sunday. We were unable to catch the train to the airport and had to catch a taxi instead. Otherwise, it is a decent hotel and we will consider staying there again in the future."
38,813,Dec 10 2007 	Very poor hotel - stay in the Novotel down the road!!	I can't believe this hotel ranks higher on Tripadvisor than the far superior Novotel down the road which I have stayed in numerous times. Stayed at the HI Express recently having paid the horrific sum of 263 for 2 nights in a family room (the Novotel was fully booked). Arrived to find that we were in a microscopic room and that the bed for our children had not been made up. The heating in the room was not working and we were not given sufficient towels and pillows for all of us. The breakfast was extremely poor with very limited choice and the coffee was undrinkable. I wouldn't mind all of this if I had paid a fair rate for the room but I really think we were charged way over the odds for a very basic hotel a long way out of central London. I will not be staying here again and recommend anyone wishing to stay in this part of London to stay in the nearby Novotel.
39,813,"Dec 7 2007 	Good location - Internet is $120.00 for 7 days!!!	I stayed at the hotel on a business trip while in London. The hotel is very modern and somewhat clean. The beds are somewhat comfortable and the pillows are hard. They do not have face clothes, instead, the have a heavy duty paper towel that has facecloth printed on it. Also, the soap comes from a dispenser on the wall - The breakfast is very typical. The internet is $120.00 for 7 days!!!The hotel is centrally located and an 8-minute walk to the Ravens or Hammersmith Tube stop"
40,813,"Oct 7 2007 	A Really Good Deal	My wife and I stayed at Express by Holiday Inn for 4 nights in September. The room was small but clean and adequate, and everything worked. They gave us a top floor room, as we had requested, and the lifts to the fourth floor worked well. We never heard sounds from neighbors on either side. We could hear trains on the Jubilee line in the distance, but the window glass was thick enough to muffle the sound. The sound of dogs barking in the morning came through, though. While the room was small, the public space on the ground floor was quite roomy. It served as a breakfast area and a lounge. The website said the hotel was a Stg 25 taxi ride from Heathrow airport, but our taxi took the most direct route (M4) and the meter showed slightly more than Stg 40 when we arrived. We will come next time by underground from Heathrow because the Jubilee Line station is only 10 minutesaway. We used a nearby Internet cafe to pick up our e-mails for Stg 1 per hour, but the hotel offers an affordable deal for accessing only e-mail sites (but not browsing), I think Stg 3 for 60 minutes. The Plough and Harrow bar and restaurant in the same building provided a good lunch, and there are many good restaurants on King Street. We enjoyed dinner at Minato Japanese restaurant. The questionnaire given to us on the last day asked if we had received the privileges appropriate to our Priority Club status and if the staff considered our needs a high priority. Perhaps this highly professional corporate emphasis is why the staff that we met were so personably helpful and friendly. We especially appreciated the genuine helpfulness of the tall young man named Saran and the young lady named Saldina. We feel the Holiday Inn Hammersmith was an unusually good deal, and the management should be complimented for doing such a good job."
41,813,"Aug 24 2007 	Basic and clean	This is a typical 'Express' hotel. Rooms are basic and a little on the small side, but clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast, which is essentially served in the lobby area, is passable but nothing special and the staff seemed very over-worked. The hotel itself is a good 10 minutes' walk from Hammersmith tube station. Definitely not worth the 109 rack rate, but ok if you can get a good deal."
42,813,"Jul 13 2007 	Great Hotel and good location	I was a little dubious when I heard was staying at a &quot;Holiday Inn Express&quot;. However I was pleasantly surprised! The rooms are modern, clean and a fair size. The shower was great - which is always a plus after a hard night on the tiles.Staff were very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast is great - the croissants were the best I have had in a long time.Mix of business people and tourists at this time of year, and there is parking available if you need it.All in all a very pleasant experience."
43,813,"Jul 2 2007 	Good value hotel in central location	I stayed here with my wife and ten year old son for a night . The hotel is everything you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express (clean, basic, good value) - we asked for a quiet room and despite the location (situated on a busy shopping street) we were given a quiet room. When I arrived I needed to make a call and the receptionist offered me the use of the hotel phone free of charge.The room cost the three of us 88 - not bad for London. The breakfast is a basic continental buffet but fine for the price.Ten minute walk to Hammersmith tube station, which is on the district line and takes approx 15 minutes into Embankment and the centre."
44,813,"May 27 2007 	Value for money	We stayed here for 4 nights in May 2007. It is a 7 minute walk from the tube station and a bit more signage would help as it is at the back of a pub, down a lane. It is a modern hotel and the front desk staff was helpfull although busy most of the time. The room were modern and clean but small with the sofa bed in use. The breakfast was reasonable and in the foyer area you could get a beer and play pool. Right in front of the hotel is a pub that has drinks and food specials every night for a good price and quality but can be a little slow. The hotel internet was expense, but they directed you to an internet cafe to the right about a minute away for 1 pound an hour. We travelled for six weeks and this was about the best value for money and I would stay here again."
45,813,"May 17 2007 	Great for the Apollo	This is a great hotel if you are at a gig at the Apollo. We stay there everytime we go. Free continental breakfast too. Loads of cereal and toast and yoghurt, tea, coffee, milk and juice."
46,813,"Apr 23 2007 	Is not worth it	I must admit this hotel is spotless clean,and of course as they emphasis they have powerful shower. The beds are comfortable, the room are a little bit cozy and small.However few drawbacks that really make this stay not worth it at all time.I stayed for almost a weeks in early April.First of all the hotel has very sensitive fire alarm, it sets off twice very early in the morning thoughout my 6nights stay. Once was when some people didnt know their toaster can only put one bread at a time and get too smokey. If only they replace the toaster....Secondly, their staffs are generally very kind, excluding this indian(or pakistan) girl i met (no offence to indians, just so happen this one is indian origin), her name is meena or meana, i can't remember. She gave me the impression she is there to answer phone calls and a few questions, she is not suppose to do anything else due to shortage of manpower. I asked for a replace of boiler, she response LATER(she was busy with other customers). The second time i asked forit she response you really want it now? What the heck is this attitude, i won't ask for it now if i want it to be replaced tomorrow. Then she said is late now, and there are no maintainance fellows in the hotel until tomorrow morning. Can you wait till tomorrow. Of course she didn't do anything the next morning.They have this tv in the room, where you can check you email, by paying around 2-3pounds per hour, but is only for email checking not surfing.Unfortunately the mouse who come with the keyboard don't seems to works. This very nice guy actually replace the keyboard for me very early in the morning when i called the reception around 6a.m. And this guy manage to delete the internet charges from my bills because after replacement of new keyboard, the mouse still doesnt work. There certainly are good people in the hotel, however one evil colleague of them is enough to make my stay.the hotel is about a 15minutes walk from the tube station, is a pleasant walk, but is not convenient enough. If you could find any hotel in zone 1 for 80pounds, then avoid this hotel at all time, unless you are trying to stick with your budget, then this hotel might offer some saving for your trip. however they don't save you money during peak season or if you book direct.The rooms are very noisy every morning when this truck come in to collect some steel container from the next door barHammersmith is a pleasant place to be only if it is good value compared with central london. But avoid this hotel, you dont want to be waken up every other day around 7 am in the morning while people start toasting their bread. Only if their receptionist (meana) are more sensitive than their toaster, i suppose"
47,813,"Apr 13 2007 	Great place to stay	This little gem in Hammersmith is a great alternative to city centre hotels. For a start there's a (small) car park which at only 12 for a 24 hour stay is a bargain but you probably have to get there early to get a space.The hotel is just off the main shopping thoroughfare in Hammersmith but is surprisingly quiet. Our room was clean and fresh with enough room for a small desk area, TV, tea and coffee making gear. We didn't need anything else. There are safe deposit boxes and a vending machine in the ground floor lobby. There is a small bar area with a pool table. Breakfast is of the help yourself continental type (cereal, juices, tea, coffee, cheese, pastries and fruit salads) taken on the ground floor. There's no restaurant but Hammersmith high street is just outside and is full of coffee shops and cafes.The nearest tube is only 5 minutes walk and within 10-15 minutes you can be in Green Park or Piccadilly. All in all I would recommend this hotel for both location and cleanliness and would definitely use it again."
48,813,"Apr 12 2007	Good value for London	Good value for London. Hotel visitors were a mix of business travelers and those on vacation. Rooms and lobby area were very clean. Breakfast Bar was very good- fresh fruits, cereals, breads, yogurt, etc... We also enjoyed the pool table in the bar area. The tube station is down the street, about a 7-8 min walk."
49,813,"Apr 10 2007 	Excellent!	Excellent! I stayed here with my partner and children over the Easter weekend as we'd booked to see Scooby-Doo in the Hammersmth Apollo. Also caught nearby tube to Madam Tussauds, Museums, South bank etc. Staff really friendly and helpfull (especially Laura - a big thanks for sorting out our room) Hotel located next to a cheap Wetherspoons restaurant where we could all eat reasonably. Also visited cinema close to hotel, as we were all too exhausted to do any more walking!Will definately stay again."
50,813,"Feb 18 2007 	Very nice	Stayed with a friend in twin room while partying at Hammersmith Palais.It is a 10 minute walk to the tube station,and 15 minutes to the Palais. It is a very clean hotel, rooms were spotless, and we got it all for 70 through one of the associated web sites that pop up on left of computer screen, it was an american site that was non refundable ( that was why it was such a good deal). Nice Weatherspoons next door, with good pubs and resteraunts on way to Palais. All in all good value ,very efficient, modern and clean. Only a buffett breakfast though, but that is expected at Expess, so cant complain, (I needed a fry up after a big night out!)"
51,813,Feb 17 2007	beware booking process	I should make clear I am not reviewing the hotel itself. For reasons that will become clear we never stayed there.I booked over the internet about a month before the proposed visit in January. I took an offer that was slightly cheaper if you paid there and then. If they gave me a booking reference I failed to note it. I assumed they would send an e-mail with the reference and details. It never arrived.I therefore e-mailed the contact address on the holiday express website asking if they could tell me the booking reference number. They e-mailed back saying they would need the details of which hotel and the date (which I had already given them). I therefore e-mailed those and the response came back that no booking had been made by me of that hotel for the date given.I proceeded therefore on the basis that no booking had been made. As I wanted to stay in London on that night but did not by now have much faith in the Holiday Express booking process I booked somewhere else.Weeks after the visit was complete I received my credit card statement showing they had taken payment. I e-mailed the contact address again asking why this was. They responded on this occasion that I would have to contact Hammersmith direct to ask. This I did. The reservations guy there asked me to send him copies of the e-mails I had before which I did. Eventually however he got in touch to say that he could not refund the money because as far as Hammersmith were concerned the booking was made. He told me to contact Customer Services.By this time I gave up as it was taking up a lot of time and getting me nowhere. The chap in Hammersmith did indicate that I had probably been e-mailing America and also that they did not seem to understand my point when explained by him - which I took to mean that he saw my point.Anyway I did not have the resolve to persevere with this but clearly they should have refunded me this payment. I just therefore wished to warn anyone else booking this hotel that while it may be fine to stay there be careful you do not end up in this booking morass and similarly out of pocket.
52,813,"Jan 26 2007 	Good for exploring London!	Stayed her for 5 nights with my girlfriend to celebrate new years eve 2006/2007! We found that the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, we are from Norway so our english is not the best but they understood!The room was clean and large enough for the two of us. Bathroom was ok! Our room was 340 (I think), and that was a bit noisy, but we were tired from walking all day i London!The next time we travel to London we will find a Hotel closer to central London, but as it was our first time there the hotel was great for exploring! The tube took about 13 minutes to central London."
53,813,"Jan 5 2007 	Great value	This hotel is very clean and comfortable. It is located right near the tube station for Hammersmith and some bus lines that take you to central London, so it is a great location for sightseeing without having to stay in an area that is too crowded with tourists. Taking the underground to the hotel from Heathrow is very easy because they are on the same line.  The rooms are very clean and did not smell like smoke the way many &quot;non-smoking&quot; rooms often can. One thing that detracted from the experience was that even though we reserved a room with a sofa bed and a double on the website, when we arrived we were given a choice of twin or double rooms because we were only 2 to a room and they allocated those rooms to families. So if you book here you may want to call before hand to ensure the specific room you book is what you get. Other than that the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel breakfast was awesome, lots of fruit, pastries, and cereal. A very good value at 70 pounds a night including breakfast."
54,813,"Dec 13 2006 	Great for travellers from the West	This is a good Express by Holiday Inn. It's own very small on-site car park make it a good option for travellers from Wales and the West of England, (providing there is a space, it's first come first served). It's about 10 minutes walk from the tube, and you can drive here fairly easily without the headaches of driving in central London. I've stayed here a few times, the last time in August 2006. The rooms have always been clean, staff helpful and continental breakfast as you would expect.The area is fine with lots of drinking and eating options close by.The hotel rates don't seem as good as some of the Express by Holiday Inns in London, and I expect this has much to do with the convenience of the site and the quality of service delivered. This is one of the first hotels I look for when staying in London, and you do seem to need to book early here."
55,813,"Oct 23 2006 	Recommended	Thoroughly recommend using this hotel if visiting London. Accessible tube nearby, quiet street, plenty restaurant choice, polite and friendly staff, spotlessly clean rooms, working (!) air conditioning, etc etc etc. We stayed here with our 2 small children and although the room was cramped with the sofa bed out, we were only really there to sleep.After reading reviews of other hotels and B&amp;Bs on here in the same area, I'm so glad we went here. Worth every penny."
56,813,"Jul 31 2006 	excellent value between heathrow and central london	I paid GBP82 for a room including an excellent continental breakfast. The room, breakfast, and the service exceeded my expectations. The airconditioning worked (it was 36.5 celsius outside), the shower was really a power shower, the room was very tidy and efficiently equipped, the breakfast offerings were plentiful and varied, and the reception at the check in desk friendly and efficient. Plenty of excellent, cheap restaurants around -- check out Sagar for vegetarian south indian cuisine across the road from the hotel on King street. I would definitely go back -- it's a great overnight stopover option en route to Heathrow (only 3 GBP on the Piccadilly line)."
57,813,"Jun 13 2006	Excellent value for money	This is the second time I've stayed in this hotel. On both occasions it has provided the perfect base for exploring London. We managed to get the (double) room for 59 per night, on the internet, a bargain for London. We had to pay to park the car in the secure Hotel car park (24 for 48hrs) but it still worked out less expensive than getting the train, and the Hotel even extended our ticket for an extra 5 hours at no extra charge.The Hotel was clean and bright, the rooms a good size, clean and smart, there's a shower but no bath. The AC in the room was great as the weather was fantastic. The continental breakfast consisted of wide choice of cereals, toast, pastries, hot drinks and juices and was included in the price.The tube links with the city are great, there are 2 stations within walking distance. Unfortunately, the line was closed for maintainance on the Saturday and Sunday but the replacement bus service took us to the next available station and it was fast and efficient there were also plenty of transport advisors around to advise and direct you.There are lots of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, if you don't fancy heading back into the city. We visited Chula which is very close to the Hotel entrance and enjoyed an excellent indian meal, which was very reasonable and a bit different to the usual (sit at the rear, in a booth it's very intimate and authentic). There were some unusual characters on the Hammersmith High street but none of them even looked our way and we never felt intimidated or threatened. Cross the road directly in front of the hotel, up the side street and under the subway and you come to a nice park area where you can have a picnic, or take a right through the park and head for about 1/2 mile to the Old Ship (my friend got married there last year) and enjoy a drink on the Thames....FAB!All in all we had an excellent time and we'll stay there again."
58,813,"Dec 1 2005	Visito to Hammersmith	It was in a perfect location for me as I was visiting the Apollo Theatre nearby. It is very convenient for the tube and its just a short trip into the city centre. Very Clean room and very friendly staff, however it was expensive considering breakfast was not provided. I would return there if I was visiting Hammersmith again"
59,813,"Oct 16 2005	Excellent hotel but not centrally located	This is an excellent, modern hotel. Its disadvantage is that it is located in Hammersmith, which is west of the central part of London. I chose it after carefully considering other reviews of it here and was very pleased with my choice. My room (no. 408) was a single on the 4th of the hotel's 4 floors. It was very modern, with a built-in desk, TV with combination computer terminal and modern tiled bathroom (shower, no bath). It had the largest bed I have ever had in a single. I have stayed in a number of other single rooms in London and Europe, and this was among the roomier ones. The breakfast was ordinary--rolls, juices, coffee and tea. The hotel is located on King St.--actually its entrance sits some way back from the street down an entrance driveway. It is a 10-minute walk to the Hammersmith underground station. King St. is a decidedly downmarket, although bustling, shopping and restaurant street. There are about 5-6 restaurants (including fast food) within 2 blocks and 15-20 within 4 or 5 blocks, although none seemed any more than average. There is a medium-size shopping mall about one block down King St. and another one in the building that houses the Hammersmith underground station. Hammersmith is in underground fare zone 2, which means that an all-day underground ticket costs slightly more than one if you stayed closer to central London in fare zone 1 (most of the attractions in London are in zone 1). It takes about a 20-minute ride to get to the sites in London that most people come to see. Thus, there very much is a tradeoff between the extra time and distance it takes if you stay here versus staying closer to the main part of London--but also involving the reasonable prices and modernity that this hotel offers. I have stayed previously in Bayswater, and it was so nice to be able to leave the hotel there in the morning and just walk to Hyde Park or some other nearby destination (although the hotel room I had there was wretched). Because of that tradeoff, I frankly can't say whetherI would choose Hammersmith or not next time. The hotel staff there was cordial and efficient. In short, very good hotel, not-so-good location. (One further thing: Hammersmith is on the underground line that goes out to Heathrow. That means that coming in from the airport (jet-lagged in my case) it's possible to get off the underground at your hotel stop without having to travel into central London and change to another underground line. A nice little advantage coming and going.)"
60,813,"Jul 26 2005	Holiday Inn Express in Hammersmith London	Funny, I usually dislike &quot;small&quot; and &quot;impersonal,&quot; and the rooms here fit both those adjectives. But I really enjoyed my five-day stay at this HI. The &quot;double&quot; rooms are small, but mine worked fine for me when I was alone. My wife joined me for my last night, and -- yeah -- that was pretty crowded. But the first four nights were fine. The rooms are well designed and efficient: a sofa, a good desk, and a comfortable bed. Everything worked, including the air conditioning (and it was in the 90's F outside). There's also a high-speed Internet connection, which is why I stayed there in the first place ... but the two I'net cafes across the street offer much cheaper connectivity. Within a few hundred yards (or meters) of the lobby, you have several good Indian, Thai, and Japanese restaurants ... a Radio-Shack knockoff ... a big grocery store ... liquor stores ... a computer store ... etc. And you're only a half-km from the Hammersmith tube station."
61,813,"Apr 5 2005	Very Enjoyable Stay	My wife, myself and our 6yr old daughter stayed here for two nights in April. All I can say is we would not hesitate to use this hotel again. I could not agree more with the previous reviews, our room was spotless as was all other areas within the hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpfull and our continental breakfast (included in the price) was well presented, fresh and plentyful."
62,813,"Mar 18 2005	well worth the stay	excellent hotel, very friendly staff and nice clean and cosey room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone spending time in london, with the tube just a few minutes walk this is a good wholesome base that takes care of its customers. Breakfast times are extended and worth getting up for.towels could do with a bit of fabric softner though."

One of the best bits is that it is opposite a fantastic Turkish Restaurant called Mirage. We have a 2 and a half year old who can be a handful but he was treated like a king by the owner and staff and we had two fantastic meals. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,815,"Sep 18 2009 	Good value hotel in London!	Easy to find, ample parking which is free if your a guest! Clean and tidy, good security!Breakfast is only a breakfast buffet and is less than average really, service good within hotel although night reception service is a bit off par. Deals for tv, music and Wi Fi in room which was reasonably priced.Overall good value for location and direct access to centre of London via local tube station only 4-5 mins walking distance from hotel. Perfect for events at O2 Arena"

It was good to be able to drive to the hotel and not have to worry about exorbitant parking fees - we were even allowed to leave the car on the car park the day we checked out!Breakfast was adequate, and also included in the price. We also ate in the bar on our 1st evening and the price was reasonable for London, arounf 40 for 3 main meals, drinks and dessert.We are planning another trip to London next year and would definitely stay at this hotel."
4,815,"May 25 2009 	Modern Hotel Immaculately Clean!	We stayed one night here unexpectedly, and were pleasantly surprised. The situation is unprepossessing, on a housing estate on a dual carriageway in Ilford. However, the hotel itself is very modern and the reception staff welcoming and friendly. The room was clean and had everything necessary. The included breakfast was an added bonus, and perfectly adequate. I would certainly stay here again if I needed a hotel in the area."
5,815,"Apr 16 2009 	Great hotel	Great hotel, couldn;t fault it. Everything was lovely and clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. rooms were a little small but everything was clean and the shower was a big walk in shower that worked properly. Hotel is easily accessible by car and is 4 minutes walk to the tube station. It takes about 30-40 minutes to get into central London by tube but it isnt a problem apart from when maintenance work is carried out on the tube line at weekends. We drove into the East End of London on Sunday as the tube line was shut and this took about 25 minutes but it wasnt a problem as the congestion zone is only valid Mon-Fri. Would stay here again"
6,815,"Apr 6 2009 	clean hotel bad location dishonest staff	Pros: + clean hotel, nice rooms with air condition and a good shower+ above average breakfastCons:- bad location: it is very close to the underground, but it takes you about 50 minutes to reach the center. On weekends there might be engineering works, so it might even take longer (it took us a good 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the center).- dishonest staff: The staff at the reception told us that it would be better if we get charged in Euros instead of pounds in our credit card. She explained that the banks usually use a bad exchange rate. We followed her advice. Unfortunately, after comparing our other payments with the credit card, we noticed that it was the hotel that misused the exchange rate. The difference was big. If you stay here, make sure you get charged in pounds. Your bank cannot choose a worse exchange rate than the hotel.- the isolation of the rooms are very bad. I woke up every time someone passed by our door. So, if you are a light sleeper, be aware."
7,815,"Mar 13 2009 	Right by a Tube station free breakfast. Very satisfied.	We stayed here for one week in Aug of 2008. It was VERY far away from the &quot;city&quot; but who cares: because it is a 4 minute walk to the Tube station which in turn takes you anywhere in London-and quickly. I think the most time we ever waited for the train was 5 minutes. Breakfast was the typical cereal, fruit, juice and toast, but they also had great cheeses and milk and yogurt. considering how much a meal cost in London (with the horrid exchange rate for the dollar) it was great getting a free meal each a.m. The decor was very modern. The breakfast room carpet was filthy, but other than that we loved the hotel. The only negative I have overall was the high speed internet was ridiculously expensive- like a dollar a minute. Seriously!"
8,815,"Mar 1 2009 	Well situated:comfortable pleasant stay.	This hotel is pleasant and quiet even though it is located right on the Eastern Avenue and thus easily accessible by road. It has ample free parking for guests and is also within a few minutes walk of Newbury Park underground station on the Central line with quick direct access into the City and central London.The rooms were clean and pleasant and breakfast was as one would expect in this hotel chain. Evening meals were available and were really excellent being generous, tasty and great value for money.Staff were generally helpful though some staff members gave the impression of being trainees both in hotel skills as well as the English language.Overall an agreeable staff at a reasonable price."
9,815,"Jan 20 2009 	Nice hotel clean comfortable and excellent all in all	Very new (2007) clean, friendly staff, nice room - good decor, breakfast included.The entrance is floor 0, the reception floor 1, odd, but nice. The 1st floor is therefore a sort of large mezanine with large windows, reception, a large lounge area, bar and a restaurant section (not room), plus a breakfast bar. All very pleasant although purple lights are a shock at first, but it works after a while. All perfectly OK and all extremly clean and well maintined. Bar prices about the same as local pubs. There is a local pub about 0.3 miles away (see google).The garage next door has a sainsbury shop in it! good food drink and all that sainburys offers (on a smal scale) + petrol :-) There is also a MacDonalds, but I haven't been in that.The nearest tube station is exactly 3 minutes walk along the main road. It took me 25 minutes to mile end road (so probably about 40 mins to liverpool street.)Room very modern lots of lights in various combinations, 32 inch flat TV, very clean shower, cable internet, and loo. Air conditioning but the manager told me it only comes on if the outside temp is &gt;12 degrees c outside ... so I was a bit hot in Jan (23 in the room).. but then I could have opened the window! (which I didn't notice the catch for!)Car park always seems to have space.Lifts have security system whereby you need your room key to get to floor ... probably because floor 0 is out of sight of anyone in reception!Difficult to find a problem realy for the price .... plus there was an offer of 10 for 24 hours internet, plus all the movies you could watch, seems cool but I had my own USB internet connection. I have 3 USB broadband which is 100% in the bar but 1 bar in my room ...Not many people in January ... good! :-)"
10,815,"Sep 25 2008 	Express by Holiday Inn-- Smart Hotel	Expressby Holiday Inn--Newbury park, London, UkDated:September 25th, 2008A Trip Advisor Member, Mumbai,IndiaAugust being a peak month we did not get much choice of Hotelsas our trip was last minute.After a lot of research on the net, i came upon the Express Hotels website,and was really thrilled to find a Hotel within our budget,a reputed brand, good location.We were told that Hotels in London do not cost less than a 100 Pounds per night.We were a Triple family, 2 adults and 1 teen daughter,booked in for a week.At first we felt Newbury Park is not a good location, not close to the Centre etc.Kind of last minute we rushed our booking thinking we took a chance.From the Heathrow Airport, it took us about 1Hour and 40 mins by the Tube.Upon landing late at night, we received a warm welcome from the front desk staff,and were pleased to see the refreshing open lobby lit by purple lights.Express by Holiday Inn, is spankingly new, spacious, airy, and the room was a treat!!Comfortable beds, fresh linen changed daily, large size LCD TV,with Internet were just some of the features at a price of GBP 75 per night, Continental breakfast included was great.!The Hotel staff was very helpful, always guiding us around well.From Newbury Park to Central London and back, by the Tube would cost us Pound 5.25 for a day pass each.Time to Oxford Circus was approximately 25 mins.Breakfast is lavish with a good choice of buns, croissants, muffins, juices,--except NO EGGS!Always crowded and full up the Lobby was alive.Close by, just outside we had MC Donalds, Banana Leaf ( Indian Restaurant ), Curry's, JD, Marks and Spensers Food, and the Tube.Modern Hotel, well worth our money.Natasha GulrajaniMumbaiIndiaWould love to go there again."
11,815,Jul 18 2008 	Good Stay	Good location with secure car park. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast - continental only. Short walk to the tube station - good for tourist visits into the city. I enjoyed the stay.
12,815,"Jun 30 2008 	Worst Of the worst!	Ok, we stayed here as we love the service Holiday Inn/Express offers. So after booking this on a visit to london 1 month before we made our trip, we were mighty dissapointed when we were told all rooms were booked, but they could give us a room for Disabled people. I wasnt happy with that, as the bathroom, etc etc was all different to normal rooms. The lady told me Matter of factly that there was no other rooms available. And my payment to the hotel was non-refundable!! After having no choice, we took the room, later in the evening when the reception staff shift changed, i tried my luck again, we were met by a very unsmiling, stern looking man called Sher. He did tell me infact that double rooms were available, and after asking me if we had 'dirtied' the room, agreed to move us.As we were attending a wedding the next day, we requested an iron, he asked me to collect the iron from the reception area, only to be told all irons were 'taken'. He would locate and give me 1 in an hours time. 6 hours later, we still did not get an iron, so i called him again. He said he would call me back in 1 hours time. 2 hours later, i went to the reception looking for him, only to be told he had gone home 2 hours ago. The staff are the worst iv ever encountered, and it is not worth the money to stay in this hotel, where you pay to get treated like nothing."
13,815,Jun 19 2008	Wonderful but way too far from downtown	Great hotel - way too far from downtown. I would rather sacrifice a little comfort and not have to take a 45 minute Metro ride into London
14,815,"Apr 27 2008 	Brill hotel but security 	I stayed here for a couple of nights and am generally pleased with the hotel. The room was clean and followed the EBHI brand standards perfectly. The lobby's great and as it's a new hotel, everything's clearly been thought about and so lighting, furniture and the reception desk are all well planned. The reception's on the first floor which is a nice touch (although I don't know why I liked it so much!) and there are two lifts to use for the rest of the floors.There were a couple of issues though; one was someone from the hotel informing me that because I'd urinated on the sofa (!) they'd had to throw it away and will need to charge me for it - I told them there was no sofa for me to urinate on even if I'd wanted to and she said wrong number and put the phone down! Was left feeling worried my card was about to be pummelled!The other issue was that after breakfast on the first day (I stayed for 2 nights) I went to reception to ask for another room key card for my girlfriend - the lady asked which room I was in and handed over the card, no verification nor security checks. This means someone from the street could come along, get a key and go straight into a room of their choice! I made sure my valuables were well hidden while I went to work!Overall though I would definitely recommend this hotel - my only advice is consider what you're leaving in your room when you're not there!"
15,815,"Apr 14 2008	Clean but far from center	I visited here with my mom and girlfriend during newyear's eve. The hotel was new and really clean. The room was simple, and had pretty much space for stuff like clothes and shoppings. It even had a nice sofa and a view to a nearby park. Breakfast wasn't exactly great, pretty poor actually, nothing warm was served. Could have been worse though, bread was fresh and coffee was good. The receptionist was very rude, but I really didn't care. The newbury park tube station was about 200 meters from the hotel, but the trip to central london lasted for about half an hour. Overall, I was satisfied with the hotel."
16,815,"Feb 5 2008	Great rate	The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk from Newbury Park Station which in turn is 27 minutes from St Paul (Liverpool St is nearer, Oxford Circus further)Hotel is better than most Holiday Inn Express Hotels. Very new and it still shows. The view from the 6th floor across towards Canary Wharf and the City is interesting, makes you realise how flat the capital is!!Definatley return if I am working anywhere on the Central line, as the restaurant who cares if the fish is small as you have thousands of great London restauarnts on hand."
17,815,"Oct 24 2007	Ask To See The Fish!	Usual Holiday Inn Express rooms and reception areas. New ish (Oct 2007) so in good condition. Not in a particularly good area for restaurant or pubs so you are stuck to the hotel restaurant. Not good, no chef on duty during my stay so a limited menu and the smallest deep fried fish (think fish finger size) you have ever seen."
18,815,"Sep 24 2007 	Exellent	Very nice, new hotel. BUT take into consideration that located in London 4, at least 40 min by tube to the city center. BTW tube station just few minutes walk away, also there is Marks&amp;Spencer supermarket just around the cornet - very convinient. Overall - enjoyed the stay!"
19,815,"Jul 11 2007 	Excellent value	The room was the usual Holiday Inn Express affair, so clean and functional and with a bath rather than a shower and not much space for clothes. Good but noisy air conditioning, but only one chair in the room - given that this was a twin bedded room booked for two, this seems odd. In addition, there was only one bath towel in the room when we arrived, but reception quickly arranged for more to be brought up. Comfortable beds and an interesting view out of the window towards central London. The car park was adequate - rather full on arrival, but quite empty the next morning - they have a large function room on the ground floor and it seemed that many of the guests using that had parked in the car park - this might be a problem when both the hotel is fully booked and there is a function downstairs. The location is fine if you have a car - convenient for the North Circular, A12 and M11 roads, but the immediate surroundings were not particularly interesting. When we first arrived at breakfast there were hardly any items left, but the staff quickly replenished it and it was a better selection than some Holiday Inn Epxress breakfasts. Overall very good value (less than 50) including breakfast."
20,815,"Jun 1 2007 	Excellent new hotel	This hotel is new and has only been open for 6 weeks, so the staff are still bedding in. The hotel is another express where reception is on the 1st floor. The staff were eager to please and looked like they had been trained very well. The room was well appointed with a large flat screen tv in the room. I had a room on the 7th floor and it was quite quiet. The breakfast was standard continental but it looked like someone had spent a lot of time making sure everything looked right. The hotel does do bar snack type meals, the hotel is next to a BP and a McDonald's and only 300 yards from the central line tube. I liked the place as it very new and everything in the room worked."

1,826,"Not only will I not stay here again .. I'll avoid any holiday inn!	My heart sank as I entered the dingy reception come bar. it was costing us 150 a night. and I expected more. we entered the dinning room - with its stained carpet and formika tables .. and one of the poorest steraks I'v eaver eaten (at 18!). the lack of attention and love was summed up in the serriously chippped cgalls candlestick in the table whic no one bothered to light. The room was fine - comfortable and quiet .. and why wouldn't it be for that price! breakfast the first day was fine - on the sunday awful - tavles piled with dirty crockery. litte food on the buffett - they were even out of butter - in the hotel accoring to the waitress. the final touch was the 7.00 per hour (or 5 minutes) to use one of the cmputers at reception to do on line check in. The hotel manager on duty and the receptionist both said oh those computers have nothing to do with us!!! such poorl trained and unresponsivive staff make one dispair, AVOID THIS HOTEL IF YOU CAN"
2,826,"Oct 12 2009 	Great Experience will definitely go back!	From the day we arrived, up until the day we left (which was 10 days later) we received nothing but great service from the staff at Brent Cross. The hotel was perfect for our needs, and I can honestly say great value. Loved the pillow menu! Ordered from room service a few times, and was never dissapointed. Also ate in the restuarant which was just as good. Also loved having Brent Cross shopping centre accross the road - what a lovely centre!All in all a lovely holiday!"
3,826,Sep 29 2009 	Fantastic hotel!	Excellent service. Room comfortable and clean. Good location for central London courtesy car to the tube station.Liked comfortable room best. Good breakfast.Alcohol in the hotel expensive.
4,826,"Sep 27 2009 	I wouldnt stay here again unless no other alternative	We stayed here for two nights in september.We live in suffolk,so booking and info was gathered online.However,on arrival our quoted room rate for 2 nights went from 160pounds to 190 pounds! this was VAT apparently.We booked a room for myself and my husband and my 12 year old daughter.We got a room with a sofabed.There were no pillows or bedding provided for sofaved and on phoning reception,we were told that bedding isnt provided for the sofabed!! we clearly booked this room for 3 people stating one was a 12 year old girl.A sheet duely appeared for the sofabed to cover the bare mattress.This was unacceptable.Breakfast is notincluded in this fee,breakfast was 14.50 per person! way too much considering room price.There was no minibar as quoted only an empty fridge with a note saying guests can store their own food in it.I t wasnt even cold! the decor of the room looks in need of upgrading,pictures on the walls had tattered frames,some wallpaper was peeling in places,and the bathroom suite was worn and tired looking.If the room was 50 pounds a night i wouldnt feel so disgruntled.There wasnt enough towelling for three people either.On a positive note,housekeeping was excellent and friendly.I think this hotel is overpriced and the rooms are in need of a good refurb.Communal areas are well kept and attractive.The hotel is situated on a very busy motorway with a footbridge over to brent cross shopping centre.I personally found it a bit dangerous making my way from hotel to bus stop,a couple of hidden corners where you cant see traffic thats turning off the motorway.i was dissappointed with the stay overall to be honest.I doubt ill stay again."
5,826,"Sep 24 2009 	Bargain family break in a good quality hotel in London	We stayed here family of four two adults and two kids aged 7 + 8 for two nights, three days to let the kids have a sample of London and get to grips with the Tube again! The hotel is a bit out of the way at Brent Cross (and I was a bit worried when some friends said that &quot;oh thats a rough area be careful) however, it was that good we will be booking again for later this year.The hotel was easy to find and we left our car in the carpark for the duration of our stay and made use of the free shuttle to the tube station - nice 15 mins tube journey into centre of London giving us time to chat with the kids and plan our route etc. The londoners we met were extremely chatty and friendly giving us tips and even giving up seats on the tube - nothing like what I expected (standoffish and not interested).After full days out sightseeing on our return to Brent X tube station, we rang the shuttle number and they arrived within five minutes to transport us back to the hotel. Staff were friendly, breakfast was nice and filling to set us up for a busy day and it was fantastic value for money.We saw all the usual sights, Buck Palace, Natural History Museum, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben etc etc but our kids really enjoyed the Duck Tours which was an amphibious tank which goes straight from land to water down slipway. Rubbish guide but the actual journey was enjoyable and different. Dont go on this expecting to learn anything about London! only to sing happy birthday to anyone whose birthday it was within the last month! We also enjoyed the Hunterian Museum at Holborn - free to get in and we were there a good couple of hours looking at exhibits in jars, weird and wonderful things. The kids really liked it there and they got pencils and an activity book to fill in about the different items to find etc. Very interesting and made you say &quot;oh my god look at that&quot; time and time again! Donations were very welcomed and we thought it was well worth putting something in. All in all we had a fantastic family break and really enjoyed London and the Holiday Inn at Brent X and will be returning within the next few months to do the things we missed out on first time around."
6,826,"Sep 19 2009 	Standard Holiday Inn	There is much to say about this hotel, it is a bog standard Holiday inn, nothing wrong with, nothing special about it, The room was clean and well equipped, Staff were friendly, food and drink was OK , again a standard holiday menu and price, The hotel is located across a busy road from the Brent cross shopping center witch makes it a good location for shoppers, despite being next o a busy inter junction there wasn't any problems with noise.The tube station is a 10 minute walk away for they provide a shuttle bus(by request only)Over all this hotel is perfectly fine for a good nights sleep if you want to be near the shopping center of wembly, but don't expect a luxury stay"
7,826,"Aug 17 2009 	Excellent perfect hotel for events at Wembley	Stayed here as part of a trip to Wembley to see U2. The hotel was excellent. Very comfortable room and public areas. Staff were incredibly helpful, advising on the best way to get to the stadium (its a 2 minute walk to the bus stop for the 182 which takes you to Wembley). The included buffet breakfast was also very good, excellent selection refreshed regularly.The hotel is opposite Brent Cross Shopping Centre whih is easily accessible via the footbridge.The hotel offers a shuttle service to and from Brent Cross Underground. We didn't realise this on arrival and the 10 min walk with luggage is tricky especially across busy roads etc, so make sure that you take advantage of this service if you're arriving by tube.Although the hotel is excellent and perfect for Wembley or other North London venues, I think that its a little far out if you're looking to do the traditional London sights. The tube journey into central London is about 15-20 mins."
8,826,"Aug 15 2009 	A perfect base to explore London from!	Stayed at the holiday inn Brent cross for one night as we were going to the U2 gig at Wembley, and it could not have been better. Straight off the M1 and drove straight there! adiquate parking, and a warm welcome on reception. Hotel very clean and tidy, staff could not do enough for us. Even provided easy directions to the bus stops, and bus' needed to get to and fro to Wembley. Relaxed bar area, and very good dining room where we enjoyed a massive breakfast that you help yourself to, and there was a huge range from cereals to fruit, and cold meats to the full English!On check out ask if we could leave the car in the car park while we popped over to the Brent Cross shopping centre, and it was no trouble! The only thing you should be aware of is too cut down on wastage, if you want shower gels, shower caps Tooth paste etc, they are not in the room, but a quick call to reception and they will send up whatever you need ( think this is just to stop everyone filling their suitcases with the complimentry bathroom products!)all in all a great base to explore London from! would use this hotel again!"
9,826,"Aug 8 2009 	Perfectly adequate and good value place to stay	If you don't mind dwelling in the inner London suburbs marooned amidst arterial road flyovers and interchanges then this place is well recommended.Compared with the totally extortionate prices of most London hotels, it's excelent value for what you get.Those who demand utter perfection ought perhaps to seek it - at a price - elsewhere.Only slight gripe was their 'extras' policy, but suppose they need to maximise guest revenue from supplements if nothing else.That said, 15 a day for internet access and 5 a day for car parking is a bit steep.Otherwise, though, a thoroughly pleasant place, with very willing and friendly staff.An alternative to the noxious tube is a leisurely bus ride to the not-so-leisurely Oxford Circus [189?] from nearby Claremont Road - at least one can observe at close quarters inner north London and its inhabitants.And couldn't be handier for the M1 / North Circular / Brent Cross shopping malls."
10,826,"Aug 3 2009 	A dated hotel that needs refurbishment	Having stayed at other Holiday Inn's, this establishment certainly falls below the standard they set themselves. The staff was friendly and polite at check-in. We had booked a double room with a sofabed as we had two young kids. The room was set-up as requested, however the first shock was the quality of the sofa bed, the matress was waffer thin and you could feel the springs and metal support beams. The bathroom looked dated and the bathtub/shower had limescale and the taps had what looked like stains. We rang reception and complained, the duty manager arrived to inspect promptly. He checked the batroom and said the stains were due to the industrial chemicals they use for cleaning so even if he got the cleaner to clean it again it would look the same. He acknowledged that the bathrooms were about 10 years old and did need changing. As for the sofabeds well according to him they were all the same. He could not offer an alternative room as the hotel was full. Thankfully we were there for just one night, the next morning we went down for breakfast. The quality was poor, given that they charge about 11 per adult, I expected better. Again the chairs were ripped and the dishes were not quite clean. The carpet on the floor had seen better days.This hotel desperately needs a refurbishment, in its current state I would certainly not class it as a 4 star hotel. I cant say I will be staying here again."
11,826,"Aug 2 2009 	Excellent service from hotel staff. Good price for a London hotel	The staff in this hotel were very friendly and extremely accomodating. They went out of their way to help us and answer and query you throw at them! Nothing was a problem. The room was clean and a reasonable price for the location. If i had to give a negative comment on the room it would be that it had advertised a mini bar in the room description, but it just had an empty fridge which you could use to put your own stuff in (only Executive ooms have a stocked fridge) ....probably a good job as we'd have only drank the contents on returning from our night out!! Plenty of parking spaces and next door to Brent Cross shopping centre. Over all very impressed and will definitely when staying in London again."
12,826,"Jun 7 2009 	Fantastic hotel with very helpful staff	I have just returned from this hotel following a weekend in London with my Husband and our 20-month-old twins. We had read previous reviews regarding this hotel's location although found central London to be VERY accessible via the free shuttle service to Brent Cross tube station. (Leicester Square approx 20 mins away by tube) Upon arrival, we were greeted by the incredibly friendly and helpful reception staff and found all the hotel staff to be the same way - nothing was too much trouble. We had requested two cots in our room (as we have twins) and only one had been organised by the hotel. However, this was very quickly rectified and organised by Voltek (not sure of the spelling, sorry!) on reception.Our room itself was a good size (particularly for London accommodation) and was clean and well stocked with accessories, although there was no shower gel in our dispenser(a minor quibble). It had everything we needed, and the mini-bar was empty for our own use (there is a tesco round the corner so this was actually quite useful for us).During our stay, we ordered room service which was prompt with delivery and absolutely delicious! Couldn't find the Pizza Hut mentioned by previous reviews, though! Room service prices were typical for a London Holiday Inn (pizza and chips came to approx 15.00). Meanwhile, breakfast staff and the drivers of the hotel's courtesy shuttle were very helpful and attentive throughout our stay, and were extremely accomodating of our (occasionally noisy!) twins.On the subject of breakfast, the choice provided was comprehensive (cereals, fruit, toast, english cooked breakfast, cheese and meats, yoghurts..the list goes on!) and the chef could be regularly seen topping up items, checking things are still hot, and re-stocking food. Brent Cross shopping centre is a short walk away, but we had limited time so didn't manage to get there during our stay.We would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it for consideration if you want to stay in a very good quality hotel very near to the 'London Sites!'. Great for couples, families or business trips alike."
13,826,"Jun 6 2009 	Outstanding!	We stayed there in April this year for a friends Wedding celebration, and I have to say we were extremely impressed with the venue &amp; services. The cleanliness of the hotel exceded what we had expected, all the staff were exceptionally friendly and really went the extra mile to make our stay perfect. The wedding was a great success, well planned and very organised, we had a wonderful time and the food was amazing! A big thanks to all the team in Brent Cross!"
14,826,"May 17 2009 	Reasonable hotel for the price.	Had to book early as we had guest relations from overseas and wanted 2 days in visiting in London, without having to pay centre prices.Could have got a better deal, had we have waited, for Holiday Inn's 2 day breaks.Clean, tidy and reception staff very helpful.There is a free shuttle mini-bus which will take and collect you from Brent Cross Tube Station.Rooms usual Holiday Inn standard. Breakfast buffet style with plenty of choice.It seem all hotels are charging (Extra) for the priveledge of parking a car these days and I find it annoying to say the least (5 per day), its another way of 'squeezing an extra 5'erout of the customer."
15,826,"May 11 2009 	good value rooms need bit of loving care	stayed here at the weekend as could not get into my usual hotels in central london , well at a decent price anyway even the travelodges and premier inns were getting on for 80 saw this hotel and looked quite new bit out of the way , but has free shuttle to tube and 25 mins into west end was fine .hotel communal areas were all modern clean and fine , staff seemed very helpful and eager to please esp breakfast staff . our room was a bit worn and tired , but very clean and comfortable , bed was fine and comfy , bathroom clean and tidy . the only rough thing was state of the ill fitting carpet and stains all over it , this was the only bad point all in all though for the price less than 60 inc breakfast i would stay here again"
16,826,"May 4 2009 	Far But Satisfied	Stayed over the easter weenend and over now, during Bank Holiday weekend. Prices are consider very cheap with breakfast and they also provide a shuttle to and from the Brent Cross station. Staff are great and helpful, breakast was alright. Negative point is that the hotel is very far from the Airport, about an hour and half, so be prepared to pull yr luggage. There is a big shopping centre across the road and although it looks like there is not much people in it, Just pop in and you will see how crowded it is. Would come back to stay for sure."
17,826,"Apr 17 2009 	How do I rate this hotel?!?	Where to begin? This is such a tough hotel to give a rating to. If you look at my other reviews you will see that I have stayed in a few Holiday Inns right round the world and its because of this that reviewing Brent Cross is tricky. You see, if I was to rate it against the others I would pan it as the worst HI I'd ever stayed in. If however I review it on price alone it would easily get 5/5. We stayed in the HI Brent cross for a family trip to London over the easter weekend. Last year we stayed in Camden but got such a good deal we chose to stay further out. Ok, lets start with the negatives. The staff are not the best...and are a bit hit and miss. We had no hot water one morning and saw a review of the room left from the previous visitor who complained of the same so it wasn't a one off. Despite having the normal pillow menu on the bed, when we attempted to get a couple of extra pillows they never turned up...I phoned again and was told they were out of all pillows?!?! The next day I asked @ 7pm if they had any spare that day and was told they would send them up. 3 and 1/2 hours later with the family all asleep they were delivered by the shuttle driver who drives to the tube station and back...I guess they don't have many staff! The breakfast was also the worst of any HI I've stayed in....the choice was poor and the quality even worse. I kept checking to see if the &quot;express&quot; name had dropped off from under the hotel sign as it clearly is more in line with the chains budget hotels than their mid range ones.So it was an awful visit, Camden Towns HI was far better and we would clearly never stay @ Brent Cross again.....errrrrrrr, well not quite. You see what has made this report so difficult to write is that for my family of 4 to stay in this London hotel WITH breakfast for everyone included AND free shuttle to the local tube station it cost me 37 per night!!! Thats 111 for 3 nights for 4 with breakfast IN LONDON!! Thats a stunning deal. Camden was more than that per night. So thats the problem...reviewed as a Holiday Inn it falls far far too short. Reviewed as a very cheap london hotel, with clean modern rooms in a purpose built hotel.....well, its second to none.Hmmmmmm, I'll give it a 3 out of 5. Its up to you which is more important."
18,826,Mar 16 2009 	good value for london	stayed here to go for a show took the car as the trains were disrupted takes about 35 mins to central london including free shuttle bus to station sometime the wait for this is considerable as the driver waits for a full bus however it is quick it takes ten fifteen minutes to walk the rooms are clean and adequate the staff are very helpful the restaurant and lounge are quite small i can imagine you might have to wait for breakfast if u are in london till late the shuttle runs until at least 11pm the hotel is not cheap but good value for london it is also well located at end of m1 ive certainly staye din much worse in london
19,826,"Dec 10 2008 	OK if the price is right	Not a bad place if you can get it at 59 B&amp;B which is their weekend promotional rate. A couple of things you should know:- Firstly, its a long way from everything except Brent Cross Shopping centre, unless you have a car you will need to use the hotel shuttle to get to/from the station and it usually stops at 11pm. They have a restaurant (breakfast was fine) and a bar but the prices are very hefty - e.g 7 for a large glass of wine. We ate in Central London every evening because we were there anyway, journey takes about 30 minutes on the Northern Line.Noise was an issue. I am a light sleeper and can't get back to sleep if woken in the night. Despite requesting a quiet room at the time of booking our room, #203, seemed to get continuous noises from some kind of service area. Reception claimed not to know the cause when I phoned them at 1.30am, nevertheless the noise quietened down straight away. Then it started up again at 4am and, after another call to reception, mysteriously quietened down again! I had to insist on a move to another room which was really quite a struggle and frankly a pain in the neck. Our next room, #611, was much quieter until 5.50am on our third night when the fire alarm sounded. So, two nights sleep ruined out of three which is not very relaxing.Overall the hotel is nicely decorated and furnished but the bathrooms could do with a bit of work. The lighting is not adequate for shaving, presumably not great for make-up either. The shower rail is wrongly positioned so that in avoiding the grab rail you end up with the curtain clinging to you as you wash - not nice. Why not install a bowed shower rail or a proper walk-in stall - the bath is so small and shallow it is virtually useless anyway? We were allocated one wash cloth between us in both rooms, did they expect us to share? My partner was enjoying a nice mug of tea in our room until I pointed out the huge crack running right through it - not very hygienic.Some of these points are fairly minor, overall it was not a bad stay but there is certainly room for improvement."
20,826,"Nov 5 2008 	great for a weekend break	we stayed at the hotel for 4 nights as we booked direct with the website and got a great deal. we stayed on a b+b basis and thought the hotel was very good in terms of location and close by to the tube station.we visited brent cross shopping centre the 1st day we were there and found a few things to buy...nothing different from the normal shopping centres, in all honesty, however, nice to browse around !!!!most of our time was spent in the City and we loved it....there is a free shuttle which takes you to the brent cross tube station...we decided to walk it there as we were there during half terms and loads of kids were around..we didnt want to interrupt families trying to get onto the shuttle..it sits 7 people, so we tohught the walk would be better...its only a ten minute walk and when you have filled up on breakfast, i think it is a good idea to walk....if you are a leisure traveller, rather than travelling on business, make sure you travel after 10am ish....as it is cheaper on the trains..otherwise you will be charged the premium amounts which the office workers are charged....we visited hamleys, science museum, did the london bus tour and also visited Ripley's believe it or not museum...we had a fab time (my wife and I) and would definitely be looking to do it again...I am a priority club rewards holder so I had points added onto my reward card for the stay...i encourage you to sign up for this as its free and allows you some excellent benefits for room rates if you provide your e-mail address....hotel wise..i think the room was great for the price we paid....breakfast was excellent too...lots of choice for everyone..the one thing you need to be considerate about is the time you come down for breakfast, especially at the weekend...it seems everyone comes for breakfast around 9am ish.....we did the same and had to wait for about 20 minutes as tavbles were not available....next to the lifts, there are a number of leaflets about various things to see and do in the city and the surrounding areas...If this is a first time for you in london, I would suggest you do the london bus tour as it allows you to visit all the majot sites..you can get off and get back on the bus at any time during 24 hours...speak to the guys and they can explain further..we caught the bus from Leicester Square and it was great fun...all in all, a fab time was to be had and we are looking forward to visiting again (this was the 4th time we have stayed in the hotel in the last 5 years)"
21,826,"Aug 10 2008 	Fab location for weekend in London	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in a family double room. We drove down from Yorkshire and the hotel is ideally situated at the end of the M1 so is very easy to find. Check in was easy and no problems at all. The parking is very cheap at just 5 per 24 hours and secure. Our room was lovely and clean although basic but no less than we expected. The staff in the hotel are helpful and friendly. They provide a shuttle service to the tube station and return back to the hotel. It stipulates times in the hotel but is was basically on demand and was a fabulous service, free of charge a bonus. Overall the hotel is a nice clean, pleasnat place to stay and I would recommend it to any family visiting London."
22,826,"Jul 23 2008 	Unexpectedly good cheap accomodation in London	We stay in London at least once a month but needed to be in the Brent Cross area this time so booked the Holiday Inn at Brent Cross. We lived in London for many years and have driven past it umpteen times but had never stayed there.We were very pleasantly surprised. For those of you who this may be a first visit for, this hotel is very easily reached by car. It is at the bottom of the M1, and in the middle of the North Circular. So any major road that takes you into London and onto the M25 will mean you can easily reach it. It is about a 5 to 10 minute walk to the tube station, and the hotel run a free shuttle service to the tube station where they are happy to pick you up and drop you off - very handy if you have lots of luggage.It is opposite Brent Cross shopping centre - for the shopaholics out there you will love it! And for those of you who want to venture into Central London there is the choice of the tube, or a bus from fairly close to the front of the hotel.Parking was no problem at the hotel and there were lots of spaces including lots of disabled spaces (in fact disabled access at the hotel for those needing it seemed very good indeed). There were several people serving at the reception desk and as the party in front of us had just arrived from somewhere via Heathrow the staff were explaining to them about transport links into London and all sorts of useful things I would love to know if I was a tourist just arriving in London for the first time.Our room was on the 7th floor (there are several lifts!!) and was perfectly clean and adequate. There was more storage space than we sometimes see in these hotels, and there was a mini bar - although ours was empty! However, we did appreciate being able to use it as a fridge for our cold drinks. Toiletries are provided, but I would suggest that if you don't like using cheap economy ones that you do take your own. Our room had both a shower and a bath. There is a hairdryer, it is situated and wired into a drawer and although it had a long lead it didn't quite reach as far as either of the big mirrors! And although it worked to dry my hair, there was no nozzle or anything and I think next time I would pack my own - for the simple reason I could stand near a mirror when I dry my hair! There were plenty of tea, coffee and hot chocolate drinks provided, and when I asked for more milk at reception they said a housekeeper would bring some up, and sure enough, ten minutes later I had the equivalent of a small dairy farm in my room. Well, I may exagerate slightly there, but there was plenty of milk!The bed was large and comfy. An extra pillow or two would have been nice, and I am sure if I had asked they would have been provided. We had a 5 year old with us and the bed settee was already made up and he was very impressed with his 'transfomer settee'. The room also had air conditioning which worked well.We had paid to have breakfast included, and when we first got downstairs it was a struggle to find a table as several had not been cleared. Breakfast was more than adquate, it is a buffet, but they could top up the empty dishes a bit faster. I got bacon, hubby was two minutes behind me and didn't, but as soon as he had finished lots of bacon appeared. We wanted to find a local park and the reception staff were really helpful pointing us in the right direction to a big park about 5 minutes walk away with swings and slides etc for our little one. The staff we encountered were all very very friendly and helpful, and overall we were impressed with this Holiday Inn and would not hesitate to stay here again. Whether you are in the UK and want a trip to London or a tourist travelling overseas to London, and you don't want to stay in the centre of Town but want to be 20 minutes or so away by tube - this place is for you.One final word, remember I mentioned this is on the North Circular? We thought 'oh dear, traffic noise'. Well the double glazing meant we were in a silent world and we did not hear any of it. And the views of the sunset over Brent Cross were wonderful. Not as good as I have seen elsewhere in the world, but I never though I would be on here enthusing about Brent Cross sunsets, yet here I am. Go see for yourself!"
23,826,"Jul 20 2008 	Ideal hotel for a visit to London	My wife and I have just returned from one of our many stays in the Holiday Inn at Brent Cross. The hotel is perfectly placed for a visit to London as it is right at the end of the M1 and only 20 mins from the city centre by tube.The tube station is only a 5 min walk away but the hotel provides a free shuttle to and from the station if you require it.Most Holiday Inns are of an acceptable standard but the staff can make a big difference to the quality of your stay. The staff at Brent Cross have always been helpful and pleasant. Breakfast is usually good but the quality and quantity can vary a bit, however it has never been poor. The rooms are always very clean and we have never been troubled by noise.We have never tried the evening meals but friends of ours said they had a good meal at a reasonable price on their previous stay.We went to London to see Spamalot and visit the Tate gallery.Spamalot was brilliant, and will even appeal to those who never &quot;got&quot; Monty Python.While in London we had a meal at Lee Ho Fooks in Soho, made famous by the Warren Zevon song. I have not read a good review of this restaurant but the food we had was very good - I , of course, had a big dish of beef chow mein.Colin Grainger 20/07/08"
24,826,Jul 12 2008 	Good value stay	Stayed at the Holiday Inn as part of a theatre break. An excellent hotel for a car driver as it is located at the end of the M1 with plenty of very reasonable parking. The shuttle bus makes travel into central London easy. The facilities in the hotel were good and the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable with two double beds and a spacious bathroom. I would certainly use this hotel again as it is very good value for money.
25,826,"Jun 17 2008 	good value for money	We have just spent a week in this hotel. This Holiday Inn is the best value for money hotel I have ever experienced. The hotel is spotless. The staff are helpful ,friendly and go the extra mile kind of people. Although the allocation of the hotel is not very central the attitude of the staff and cleanliness of the hotel more than made up for the distance to the city. There is a shuttle to the tube. The hotel is across the road from a shopping mall and close to a bus station as well."
26,826,"Feb 17 2008 	Relaxing and a bargain	We stayed at this hotel for a weeked trip to London. The bargain rate made the whole trip possible and we found the hotel to be very comfortable indeed with attentive and courteous staff. The breakfast was excellent and our requests for a quiet, high level room were met. The location is the only draw back but we were transported between the hotel and tube station each time in the courtesy car."
27,826,"Dec 6 2007 	Worth Considering	This Holiday Inn is modern, clean and well equipped. I have stayed there several times as the location is convenient and there is free parking. One draw back is that it is a ten minute walk to the nearest underground station and not a pleasant walk at that. However there is a courtesy bus which operates more or less on demand. There is not much in the way of night life around the hotel and plenty of people seem to eat and drink in the hotel. the food is average and prices are expensive. I bought a bottle of Magners Cider and this cost me 4.60 - about double the price in a pub. I have alsways found the staff pleasant and helpful. Often the hotel price is favourable when those in London are expensive,"
28,826,"Nov 17 2007 	Good Hotel - great value	Stayed for 1 night with our 2 children. We booked a room with 2 double beds. The check in was excellent - very quick and efficient &amp; friendly. You don't get offered any help with your luggage but since we were only staying for 1 night it was no problem.The room was fine - large enough for the 2 double beds and space to walk around. The beds were good with firm matresses and spotless linen,The bathroom was small but acceptable - the stainless steel taps and plugs could have been more shiny but they were clean. The shower worked well with plenty of hot water.The breakfast was superb - first class friendly service and for this type of hotel an excellent selection of breakfast items. The staff could not have done more for us and the children.Checkout was very efficient - but beware they charge you to park your car in the car park overnight (5) which you are not notified of in advance. Would not hestiate to stay there again."
29,826,"Sep 23 2007 	Oh dear!	Well, I booked one night in an executive room at the Holiday Inn Brent Cross....I got there and, firstly I can see why people have moaned before about the rude reception staff. They all seemed too occupied to be interested in the person they checked in. However, I was helped by one member of receiption staff who, I must say, was exptemely nice nad very helpful.The room...well...If they call this an executive room (and the plaque on the door proudly boasts so), its definately some with the bare minimum off effort. The room was small to say the least! Some of the room lights weren't working (but the nice receptionist did come and fiz that for me), the bathroom sink was cracked and....this make me laugh more than anything....They don't allow you to put any of your own drink o rfood in the mini bar and refused to empty the minibar incase I put my own stuff in there. Anyway...moving on....bathroom was clean, nice towels, very comfy king bed I must say. More disappointment followed when me and my partner went ot have dinner downstairs. The restaurant had full beam lights on and no music or atmosphere at all. The menu was overpriced AND the waiter informed us as soon as we sat down that the water that was on the tables (which had been out all evening and was warm), was 3.50 a bottle! We nearly chocked! After spending a couple of minutes laughing at how bad this evening was turning out to be we then had the waiter come over and point out that all basically all the starters were not available. At this point we decided to jsut get up and walk!We went to reception to ask for a near hotel...the man told us that if we liked italian the shuttle car could take us to the nearest tube where we shoudl get on the tube for one stop and get off and eat somewhere around there!Well...we decided this was turning into a monumental disaster so we went to Tescos (just over the raod) and bought some wine and nibbles and ate them in the room. Just a heads up....they don't charge for an ice bucket.....well they do if you ask them to bring it to your room (2.50 to get in an elivator and come 3 floors up! Nice work if you can get it!).All in all....This was a rubbish evening! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! And I'd hate to see what they call an 'standard' room! My advice is stay ANYWHERE but here!"
30,826,"Sep 6 2007 	Rude receptionist	Arrived at hotel to be told by receptionist that we did not have a booking (whilst we knew the booking had definitely been made). It took a prolonged period of time for him to sort this out. He was rude and sarcastic in manner. It was after 10pm and I asked him were there any shops nearby (as I wanted to get a soft drink). I was told sarcastically &quot;madame there is a shopping centre right in front of you&quot; - which, I should add, was closed. I found him to be extremely patronising and offensive in that he treated me like I had no intelligence.The room was fine, but I definitely would never stay here again due to the experience with this very rude receptionist."
31,826,"Sep 3 2007	No problem	Never had a problem at this hotel, but never had breakfast either so can't comment on that.It's worth getting a high floor, views are not that great even then, rooms are nice and large, clean and well equiped.We always drive down, park at the hotel and catch the bus into London, it stops just around the corner and goes as far as Oxford Circus."
32,826,"Aug 27 2007 	Poor quality and standard	We have just returned from a weekend stay at this hotel. For the past 3 years for the rugby final we have been staying at this hotelThis year the standards were very disappointing. Broken lift, extremely poor service at breakfast time--waited 15 minutes to be seated, lack of cleared and clean tables. Then waited additonal 10-15 minutes for the bacon to be cooked in the kitchen. Also no fried eggs. The coffee was overbrewed and not drinkable. Usually although self service the watier/ess comes around and asks do you want another drink but they did not have the time to clean the tables and manage the people waiting to be seated never mind customer service. It is such a shame because the location of this hotel is great especially with the shuttle service to the tube station but very poor experience this year."
33,826,"Jul 19 2007 	Handy place to stay in London especially with a car	A clean hotel, very easy to get to from the Motorway, with a shuttle to the nearest tube station. There`s an easy walk to the shopping mall across the road, and right next door, there`s a large Borders bookstore, this is a great place to while away a few hours in the evening ! The food in the restaurant was excellent and well presented. I`ve attached photos of the views from each direction of the hotel.. rooms overlooking the shopping mall have good views of all the hustle and bustle of being in London, and the sound insulation is excellent .. so you can relax and watch London go by. Rooms at the back do not have such a good view, but even so, dont let this put you off this hotel, which makes a good place to stay if visiting London with a car."
34,826,Jul 11 2007	Great Value - No Thrills Hotel	Stayed at this holidaY Inn at Easter.This is a great hotel especially if you have a car.There is a car park all around the hotel which is rare in London!It is just off the M1 motorway.Without a car the hotel has a free minibus service to the local tube station so you cdan get anywhere..Our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking waste groundbut it was a clean sunny room.It had 2 double beds with nice modern white bed linen and a nice clean bathroom.We have stayed here several times before and get the best deals out of the Mail on Sunday.The reception staff have always been very helpful .IT is a fairly cheap hotel with no extra like a gym but we are happy with that.
35,826,Jun 10 2007 	Overpriced !	Firstly I would have rated my experience above average had I not payed so much for the room 122.50 !I choose this hotel as it was the closest one to a training course I was attending and had there been other options I would have gone elsewhere.Although this hotel is only 3 * it is a very nice one but not worth the money. I was impressed with the standard of the rooms but lots of strange noises throughout the night.Reception staff were pleasant but a bit slow off the mark when I requested a new pillow - holiday inn offer a choice of 5 so i thought id be very comfortable - WRONG. The softest pillow was like sleeping on a brick it was really awful I barely slept.Breakfast food was nice but service was appaling I was ignored by waitresses they seemed intent on serving all the men and it took me 10 minutes to get a cup of tea &amp; I had to ask for this.Also had to pay 5 to park my car which I was not impressed with as already cost me a bomb to stay the night !
36,826,"Apr 19 2007 	Just Awful !	I don't think I've ever had the misfortune to stay in such a depressing and tired hotel. I was greeted by a receptionist with a face like thunder who made no attempt to engage in eye contact or conversation.My room was in need of a good clean and redecorating, overlooking a derelict petrol station.The air conditioning is very loud and there was a lack of hot water in the evening. The restaurant is best avoided, souless with poor quality food and service.If you do stay here use the courtesy bus from the tube station to the hotel, this isn't the sort of area you want to walk alone especially after dark."
37,826,"Apr 13 2007 	Great value! Great Breakfast	Our entire family (wife and 3 kids) just stayed at the Brent Cross Holiday Inn during a short vacation stay in London on our way home from Africa to the States. The hotel is about 45 minutes from Heathrow via taxi cab and although websites state the cost at 40 pounds it is more like 50-55 pounds one way. The hotel is just a 5 minute shuttle ride from the tube station. You can walk there if you like, but I do not recommend it, especially with children. You basically need to run across a freeway to get to the correct pathway and it was quite nerve racking the one time we tried it. But the shuttle is free and easily available. From the Brent Cross Tube station you can get anywhere in London Central. Most of the major tourist areas (museums, theaters, restaurants, etc.) are about a 20-25 minute tube ride and it really is easy to get around anywhere in London that way. The hotel breakfast buffet is fantastic. Nothing like a Holiday Inn continental breakfast here in the US. Eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, lots of fruit, juice, bread choices and cereal are all abundant. Great food and a good price for a hotel, kids under 12 eat free which is wonderful. If you don't mind being a little bit outside of Central London and using the Tube quite a bit, I highly recommend this friendly, clean and fair priced hotel. It's listed as 2 stars, but definitely the food quality, room quality and service make it a 3-4 star in my mind."
38,826,Jan 20 2007 	nice location	This hotel used to be the garden court and having booked it now as the Holiday Inn Brent Cross things are even better. Whats great is this is an out of centre lcoation but with west style shopping at your door step. Of course its opposite the great Brent Cross covered shopping centre but now its also right next to a brand new retail park. The hotel is great for a no thrills base. The usual holiday style junction restauarnt with no other facilities. But golders green and hendon have a ton of pubs to hang out in of an evening. I booked with www.milesfaster.co.uk and that went as well as my stay. All in all a happy camper.
39,826,Jan 8 2007 	Great Hotel on the outskirst of central London	This is a great hotel situated about 20mins from Central London via the tube.We wanted a hotel that was central to Wembley Arena and easy access into London. This hotel was perfect. Wembley was 10 mins via a taxi which cost 16.00 each way.The hotel runs a shuttle bus back and for the nearest underground station which is Brent Cross.The staff at this hotel are extremely helpful and friendly. We were coming back from Central London late (shuttle bus stops at 23:00) and they organised a taxi to collect us from the tube. Part of our package was a 3 course meal which again was very nice. Another bonus is that the restaurant opens at 1700 so is perfect if you want to catch an evening show in the Westend.A useful note - if you arrive at Brent Cross tube station ring the hotel to come and collect you. We did not know about this service and the walk to the hotel is via several dual carriage ways. Not easy when you are carrying luggage.I would definately stay in this hotel again.
40,826,"Jan 3 2007 	Great value - good food	We stayed at the hotel with the intent of taking the underground into London for the sight seeing. The hotel has a car that took the guests from the hotel to the underground station &amp; back again - it ran every 15 minutes or so &amp; you could always call to get a pick up during operating hours (they close early on holidays &amp; aren't running all night). It was a fairly short ride into downtown London and for any frugal traveler looking for a decent hotel, I'd recommend it. The hotel staff isn't that friendly, but the bar staff was quite nice. With the hotel staff, you get the impression they don't listen to your requests at all - I got that impression after multiple requests for the same things... We booked a nonsmoking room about 6 months in advance &amp; when we arrived, our room was a smoking room with nothing else available (but the smoking room didn't have any noticeable smells).We requested the feather pillows for 2 nights (there is actually a &quot;pillow menu&quot; to select from) and ended up finally getting a normal pillow delivered to the room, oh well.Don't order the ham &amp; cheese sandwich from the room service, it wasn't anything special, but the rest of it was pretty darn good!! Very surprised at the quality of the hotel food. Here's a hint - they hide the hair dryer in the dresser!! It's not in the bathroom."
41,826,"Dec 19 2006	Room not checked.	I am a gold card member as well but I just went ahead and booked an executive room without waiting for an upgrade. Not really worth the extra money in my opinion. First problem was on checking in when for some reason they had my home address wrong and had no idea of my priority number. Eventually got that sorted out by telephone to some guy in the states (I presume) who was very efficient and soon sorted it out.Next problem was the room. No dressing gowns or slippers and the safe did not work. The desk light had no shade and could not be used because of the brightness. It was all sorted out by a couple of very pleasant staff but surely the room should have been checked beforehand? There is not really much, if any, in the way of function rooms and on the night we arrived a party had taken up most of the restaurant/bar area along with some pretty loud music. Quite enjoyed it later (especially my niece!) but to be told you may not be able to have dinner in the restaurant because of said party was a bit off I thought. Again, it turned out ok but only after I rearranged some of the furniture so we could sit down. Bar staff were very efficient.Breakfast compared to other H.I. was poor. Quite a small serving area and no fried eggs. You could of course order them but after 20 minutes we tired of waiting. Sausages were very good however, try them, you won't be disappointed.Check out was fine if a little slow. Never used the mini bar but it is one of those that activate if you even look at it and we got charged for 2 items we had not taken. Receptionist was not phased and soon sorted it out. Car parking is safe and plenty of it and the area is pretty safe. Footbridge across to the shopping centre which has a pizza hut amongst other eateries. Did not see any pubs close by but hey, its only a few minutes from the big city!"
42,826,"Oct 28 2006 	One of the best Holiday Inns around!!!	Stayed here for 3 nights in the King Bed, Executive Room. Had complimentary items in the room such as chocolate, water, etc... and extras such as robes and slippers. The breakfast was great, the eggs and bacon was well cooked. The service was excellent. The only thing I can think of that the hotel had opportunities to improve is the shuttle service. One driver was great. He helped us with sightseeing questions and never let anyone wait if you arrived. But other different drivers stuck to the schedule and made you wait. At times they were late and that meant waiting as well. Overall, excellent experience. Compared to other hotels, the value we paid was well worth it. London hotels in general are expensive and I can justify paying for the cost for this hotel. Would stay here again if I came back to London."
43,826,"Aug 9 2006 	Excellent for families as well.	My family (2 adults + 2 children), stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks during last July. The hotel is very clean with plenty of free car parking. The rooms are well equipped with Sat TV, mini bar, hairdryer etc. Just opposite the hotel a splendid shopping center is found with plenty of free and covered car parking. Breakfast is quite good as well. Hotel offers minibus service to the nearby underground train station every 20 minutes, free of charge. Its location is excellent if you consider visiting places other than London Oxford street shops. Booking thro Internet is easy and you get better prices."
44,826,"Jun 29 2006	Excellent Value	I've been meaning to write a review on this hotel for a while now! We picked the the Holiday Inn Brent Cross quite simply because it was the only thing I was willing to pay for in London! As I'm sure everyone agrees with, London is an extortionatly expensive place to stay!I reserved the hotel over the Intercontinental Hotels Groups website and got an excellent rate of 57 GBP per night. (Excellent when I saw the placard in their lobby which said 'rack rate 180 per night!') For this we were given a lovely comfortable queen size bed (for the same price I could have also reserved two doubles or a sofa bed and a double - very handy for families). The room was very spacious and bright and had excellent double glazed windows which kept out every sound from outside. This was especially good as it was on quite a busy road. The tricky part was to get the lights to work as they give you two keycards, one slots into a little machine on the wall inside the door and when you put it in you can then turn on the lights. However, don't take it back out again as the lights are on a timer. I found this out after removing the card and getting half way across the room before being plunged into darkness! A bit unusual! The bathroom was very clean and was well stocked with fresh towels every day. We had a nice big screen tv with all the terrestrial channels and a few radio stations. The room has a mini bar but it is very expensive, even by mini bar standards. The best part about this hotel is its location. It is a tube journey to London but a short and pleasant one. The tube station is a 10 minute walk away and along the way there is a gigantic Tesco store! The journey to London takes about 20 minutes and the staff at the rail station are lovely. You can buy a day pass for about 7 which allows you to hop on and off any tube or bus you like which is really excellent value for travelling around London all day! The hotel also has a shuttle service which will drop you to and from the tube station from about 8 am til 11 pm for free. We came home from a concert in Kentish Town at about midnight and the area is so quiet and safe.Right across the road from the Hotel is the Brent Cross shopping centre. It has an excellent food court and a really good selection of shops. There is also a retail park beside the hotel. All in all I think in terms of price and location you cannot beat this hotel. It is great to have a wander around Brent Cross shopping centre and then return to your hotel room and sleep in a lovely comfortable bed and know that you haven't paid so much money for it! If you are really stuck up on spending your holiday in London central and can spend the cash to do so, go ahead. But for people who like to spend more on souvenirs than a place to sleep and still get a beautiful hotel room, this is the place for you! I can't wait to go back in September!"
45,826,"May 26 2006	SAFE and CLEAN	This location is pretty accessible via The Tube from Central London. The rooms are clean and very roomy, unlike some of the 5 Stars in the City. There is shuttle service from the Brent Cross Station, make sure you have a calling card or cell phone handy. The staff are very nice and accommodating. The food in their restaurant is pretty good, but VERY pricey, you can get better deals in the City if you know where to look and are willing to look. Beds and pillows are clean and fluffy. The power shower will literally blast the dirt off of you, no need for soap. You can adjust the room temperature to you liking. Internet is available for a small fee. Shopping is close by, but be very careful of the road way. I will always return to this location for all my trips to London. Lots of free parking. 24 hour room service. Full bar."
46,826,"May 2 2006	Average- OK if you get a good rate.	I booked this hotel on a Spring Sale rate 59 B+B. I am a Priority Club Gold member but did not get an upgrade as i often do at other H. Inns. There are only 8 executive rooms in this hotel and i was told that they were all booked up for my 3 night stay. I was given a standard room with 2 double beds, a voucher for a free glass of wine and a bottle of mineral water in the room instead. The room was small and had a view of a disused petrol station. ( Views on the other side of the hotel are of a busy main road) The beds were soft. I tried both; neither were comfortable for me as i like a firm bed.The hotel was very busy and the breakfast staff tried really hard to keep everything well stocked but couldn't keep up so guests were having to wait for things or keep asking staff. The food was average H.I. fayre. I ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was better. The hotel shuttle is a 6 seater people carrier. Both times i called the H.I for the shuttle,from the tube station, it came very quickly. However on check out day i had to wait in a queue with others as they had no driver and the receptionist had to finish dealing with a long line of people checking out before doubling as the shuttle driver. I missed 2 trains home as i had to wait an hour for the shuttle. I would have ordered a taxi if i had know but i was told that the shuttle would 'leave soon'. When i finally got the shuttle i was told that 'they had not employed the shuttle driver or a relief as they were saving money'!I would not stay at this H.I. again as the tube journey was longer than i expected to central London, 25 mins. The overall experience also was not one that would encourage me to return.On a more positive note the nearby Brent Cross shopping centre was very good and easy to walk to."
47,826,"Apr 30 2006	nice hotel nice location....average food	We stayed at the hotel in the middle of april this year. The location is excellent if approaching via the M1 as one avoids the London orbital. The hotel is easily accessible, staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. The shuttle service to the tube was a plus, though necessary due to the distance from the tube station. The free parking at the hotel was a definite plus. The food wasnt something to write home about and the breakfast spread was decidedly mediocre.I would stay here again simply because of the price and easy accesbility to central london."
48,826,"Mar 13 2006 	Hernia Repair? Use this hotel!!!	If you are having your hernia repaired at the British hernia Centre or just intend to stay overnight in London, I highly recommend this hotel.It is in an excellent location, one minute from Junction 1 of the M1, and only 20 mins from central london by tube. The room we had was a twin, all of which have two double beds. The room was clean and the food was of a great standard for a 3 star, the room service menu was surprisingly extensive. The hotel runs a FREE taxi service to and from the hernia clinic and to and from the tube station which runs all day. Our taxi was stuck in traffic, so the manager ran us down to the clinic in his own car! Top service.If you're having an op, reserve a twin bedded room, you won't regret having your own space, away from the wife's elbows, when your looking for a comfy, painfree position to collapse into.JTNotts."
49,826,"Feb 4 2006	Good hotel and great value	I hope this is helpfull to all. My wife and I stayed here in June 2000 and again in 2003. The hotel is very good value for money. The rooms are very nice, the breakfast is excellent with a fine selection to choose from. Just a short walk across a footbridge in front of the hotel is a very good shopping centre (mall) with a fine selection of shops (this was one of the first large purpose built shopping centres built in London). The hotel has a courtesy shuttle to the tube (underground) station , which is about 3 mins drive. The journey time into central london is approx 20 mins. When you return just phone the hotel and they will send the shuttle to pick you up. If you have a cell phone just phone the hotel when you are at Golders Green station,saves a wait at Brent cross station. Directions from (1) Heathrow. Take the tube to Leicester and change to NORTHERN line to the northbound train marked EDGEWARE and get of at BRENT CROSS. From (2) Luton airport take GREENLINE bus to London and get of at BRENT CROSS shopping centre ( if you have a mobile phone so you can phone hotel for shuttle and tell them you are the opposite side of carriageway) or walk the short distance to the shopping centre and call hotel from there . If you have children and/or a lot of luggage, take the busal the way to Victoria Tube station and find your way from there ( go into the tube station and go to the CIRCLE line and take a trainn to EMBANKMENT and change to NORTHERN line and take a northbound train marked EDGEWARE) and get off at BRENT CROSS staion. Enjoy"
50,826,"Aug 28 2005 	Really good hotel!	Stayed here for 2 nights and we were very pleasantly surprised st what we found. Plenty of parking space, relatively easy to find, friendly staff, efficient service and excellent food in the hotel restaurant (this was actually one of the best meals we have had believe it or not) although a little pricey we thought, there was a reasonable wine list and nice atmosphere. Room service failed to turn up but when alerted they delivered promptly, apologised and reduced the bill. Breakfast was huge and very nice.Would definately recommend this hotel with the only negative being that the bathroom although sufficient looked a bit tired and could do with updating."
51,826,"Aug 14 2005 	Average expeience most of the time	I travel to London a lot from the North of England on business and normally stay at This hotel as it is conveniently placed at the bottom of the M1. I usually have about 5 nights a month here and yes the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean,spacious and air-conditioned. The food can be well below average and on the whole for some reason I find the quality of Room Service food to be better than that in the restaurant. The London Tube 'shuttle' is very good when leaving the hotel but they can be very tardy when you need to be collected from the station and returned to the hotel.Previous reviews highlighted problems when attempting to get to the Brent cross Shopping Centrre/Mall - at busy times of day this can be a problem on foot as you are crossing a feeder road to the notorious London North Circular - avoid peak times and you should be OK. There are a good range of shops when you get there but foodwise if you take my advice get a taxi to Highgate or the tube to Belsize Park. There are many good value ,good quality restuarants there."
52,826,"Nov 7 2004	Nice hotel	Nice hotel in Northern London. Good for those arriving at London Luton airport. We've been there for a night on 6th of November 2004.There is a big shopping mall right across the street. Well, &quot;right across the street&quot; is unfortunately a disadvantage of the hotel. I mean, to get there by walk is quite an achievement. I know that there is the M1 Motorway nearby, but still it's REALLY hard to get from the hotel to the mall or tube station by walk. Fortunately the hotel offers free shuttle from the front door to the tube station of Brent Cross (and from tube to the hotel). Very nice of them.The rooms are quite nice, medium size, rather big bathroom. Clean and bright. Staff is very helpful, food could be better but it's not bad.Great place if you are there for an event at Wembley Stadium (which should be ready in 2007 :)).Overall - good choice."
53,826,"May 20 2004	Great place to stay	I spent a week at the Holiday Inn - Brent Cross and I have nothing but good things to say about the rooms and the friendly staff. I've stayed in central London on other occasions, but decided to stay in Brent Cross because the room rate was better. I expected to give up quaility for the better room rate, but imagine my surprise when I walked into a very nice room and was welcomed by very helpful staff. Finding my way to central london was easy with the tube station within a short drive, courtesy of the hotel shuttle and there is a mall (brent cross shopping center) within walking distance. The breakfast was excellent although the eggs tended to be alittle runny. Otherwise the food was good. Hey, if you want pizza, just walk across the way to the shopping center for some Pizza hut or Marks and Spencer(grocery store) for sandwiches and wine or other snacks.I will most likely stay there on return trips. You truly get more for your buck(or pound)."

1,827,Nov 15 2009 	Pleasant Hotel	My friend and I spent two nights at this hotel and were impressed with both the cleanliness and staff. We booked the hotel as we were attending a function nearby otherwise we would normally stay in a more central location. The only disappointment was that breakfast was not included in the rate although there were several restaurants within easy walking distance and we could have paid extra for breakfast at a reduced rate on check-in.I would recommend a meal at the Camden Brasserie which is just across the road. We had dinner here on our first night and thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,827,"Oct 25 2009 	A hassle-free stay in a clean friendly hotel.	This hotel is very well-placed for exploring the delights of Camden Markets and Lock.We couldn't check in until 2p.m. but were allowed to drop our bags off early, which helped.Room was quite spacious with two large double beds and a reasonable sized bathroom.Clean and quiet are my main requirements, and we got both.Friendly reception and a nice meeting area with coffee bar and tables.Breakfast very expensive but only adaquate - nothing to justify the price really.Next time I'd eat at one of the many places nearby."
3,827,"Oct 24 2009 	Wouldnt stay there again due to the poor service!	After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, and the hotel being in the perfect location as we were travelling to go to the Robbie Williams concert at the Roundhouse, we decided to book with this hotel despite being quite expensive! Booked over the phone with no problems and good service however whe we turned up at reception they had told us that our room had been cancelled and we werent notified!!!! Despite this they were fully booked and we had travelled for hours and definately needed a room. The reason for this was because there had been an issue with the payment as apparently if using a switch card to pay it needs to be physically there if you dont have an issue number???!!! There excuse was that they couldnt get through on my mobile and had left a message which never came through! Although they never tried to post or email me as accordinging to them this is not there policy even if they have them details!!!!! So they had cancelled a room and not notified us!!!!!!!! Terrible service we were left waiting in reception for over an hr and eventully when he magically found us a room...he offered no benefits or discounts and acted like he was doing us a favour!!!!!! The hotel however was very clean, good rooms, excellent breakfast however due to all the hassle we wouldnt stay here or in a Holiday Inn again.....although Robbie was absolutely amazing and overshadowed the rubbish hotel service!"
4,827,"Oct 8 2009 	Comfortable Hotel in Pleasent location	The hotel is modern and seems quite new. The rooms are of a good size and are very clean. The place was also noise free at night considering it was in LondonThe hotel is about 4 minutes from Camden town tube and while the northern line is not the greatest to be on as you will have to change the majority of times its only 1 stop from kings cross station and only a few stops from oxford st. did not have breakfast there is quite expensive went to nearby diner. The hotel is beside a starbucks and a wagamama and it beside the markets of Camden which I found lovely but the area did not appeal to my older mother as there is a lot of teens and young adults with tattoos, skateboards and dressed wildly about so maybe not the best area for older or more conservative people. There are also not alot of nice restaurants more pub grub around. The internet in hotel is quite expensive but overall good stay esp of you get the rate we did on hotwire makes it a bargin compared to other lower class hotels in central London."
5,827,Oct 7 2009 	1st class hotel. Best Holiday Inn i have stayed in. Made me feel at home	The hotel is located in a lively part of the town. Easy to find. Hotel is very modern and bedrooms very clean and of a suitable size.The staff were really attentive and made me feel at ease during my stay. Even when i passed a member of staff in the corridor they were very welcoming.Breakfast was busy but had a good selection of food. More so than in any others which i have stayed at.Easy access to the west end and Oxford street.1st class hotel.
6,827,"Oct 4 2009 	Great location	Excellent location in Camden, overlooking the lock and market and 5 mins from tube. Stayed in room 213. Immediate view is of office building, but when you open doors of room, you can see good view of lock and market if you look to your left. When arrived in room, TV didn't work and there were no shampoo or conditioner in bathroom, but staff were very apologetic and it was all sorted out in less then 5 minutes. Breakfast was 9.95 each if you paid for it when checking in (otherwise 12.95 on the day) and was good value as good selection and eat as much as wanted. Went into hotel to book and was offered standard rate, when pressed they then offered the advance booking rate, but found a cheaper rate online with hotels.com."
7,827,"Sep 22 2009 	Wonderful stay	Four 18 year old girls traveling alone for the first time. Booked this hotel through Hotwire for seven nights. We got two nice rooms with two double beds in each. Though our windows faced a brick wall, this meant that we heard no outside noise at night, which was perfect. Tried the restaurant one night, and they had really good food. And the staff were really nice and helpful."
8,827,Sep 9 2009 	Hotel and location great but beware of referrals from the front desk	We spent 8 nights at this hotel and overall had a very pleasant experience. The neighborhood was lively and an interesting place to shop. Hotel is close to Camden Lock tube station. Only have 1 major negative to report: DO NOT ALLOW THE HOTEL TO CALL YOU A TAXI. Twice we arranged for taxi service through the front desk. Each time we believe we were overcharged. For example return charge to Paddington Station was 5 pounds more than inbound trip. Note that taxis provided by hotel were not typical black London taxis. They were guys in minivans who had dubious taxi meters. Otherwise experience was pretty good. Would recommend this hotel.
9,827,"Aug 31 2009 	Great London location - full of character""	The Hotel was fine, very friendly staff and good amenties. The location was great, just on Camden Lock and the Markets, which is brilliant for our 14 year old daughter. Lots of restaurants to chose from. The Mango Room near the Camden Town tube station is fabulous. Great food.Only a short walk to Primrose Hill which has magnificent views across the city.All in all we had a great time."
10,827,"Aug 25 2009 	Generally pretty good	Stayed here on business. Location not ideal, but hotel generally pretty good - rooms nice and large by London standards, although furniture a bit cheap. Service at check-in a little brusque but nevertheless efficient. Did not try breakfast. Ironing board a bit crappy. Otherwise not bad - just remember that the location means it may be a bit noisy. Plenty of good restaurants etc. nearby, although area may not be to the taste of some business travellers."
11,827,"Aug 9 2009 	Good value just be prepared for the neighborhood	We spent 5 nights here in two separate rooms. For London, I thought the rooms were quite spacious and were very clean. We had an issue with the A/C that took a couple of calls to maintenance to get resolved, but it was eventually fixed. Main objection regarding the hotel was it's location, and the noise level. We were put into two rooms on the 2nd floor overlooking Jamestown road, which by itself was not a busy or noisy road, but there is a bar across the street on the corner which has a very loud outdoor clientelle until well after 1 am on Friday and Saturday nights. I observed in advance the possible problem when we checked in, and was told that it never a problem, which in fact it was, so I think they were just wanting us to take the room knowing we probably wouldn't want to uproot and switch once we had settled in. The location is right next to Camden road and Camden Market, which is frequented by seemingly no one other than tattooed and body pierced individuals. Most of the storefronts along the street are tattoo parlors or t-shirt shops, or both. We never really felt unsafe, but just know this before you go and be prepared for a little bit of culture shock if you are not used to tattoos, multi-colored hair, and piercings all over the face."
12,827,"Aug 8 2009 	Pleasant and functional	Ideal for exploring the Camden Town area, Regents Park / Zoo, Primrose Hill, etc, and still only 15 minutes from Leicester Square on the Northern Line, this is a well-located hotel.I booked via the Holiday Inn website and the photos there make the hotel look very contemporary and almost boutiquey. The hotel doesn't quite live-up to those images - it is clean, modern, functional and pretty-much provides everything that you could need from a hotel at this price range, but it wasn't quite as funky as I had expected for this location and there was far too much cheap 'wood' veneer. The room was of an okay size, but the bathroom felt tiny. It had a multi-channel tv, tea/coffee and biscuits, tissues, facecloths, iron, minibar, safe and all other amenities - except complimentary toiletries (except for wall-mounted squeezy containers). My room faced onto the street and, whilst you could make-out some slight noise from nearby bars, it really wasn't intrusive and didn't continue late into the night (despite being a Friday).Breakfast was comprehensive and the service was very attentive throughout my stay.Overall, this is a modern mid-range brand hotel - not outstanding quality and not spacious, but spotlessly clean, with good service and comfortable. I'd go again."
13,827,"Aug 6 2009 	Great Location Great Hotel	Family and I stayed here in July for nine nights. The location is great - close to Camden Market, Sainsbury, tube station, Regent Park and all types of restaurants to suit the most discerning tastes.The room was small but well furnished and maintained; the bathroom was clean and bright.The beds were a littel soft as were the pillows (which were somewhat lifeless) but staff was cheerful and helpful.The array of foods available was astounding - Camden Market is filled with little food stalls that served Mexican, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian, Malaysian, Fish &amp; Chips. Not to mention the many restaurants around and your typical KFC. Sainsbury is a 5-minute walk away.Would definitely stay there again and would recommend to anyone. Ask for a room that faces the inner &quot;courtyard.&quot; Not much of a view - unless you happen to like to stare at a blank brick wall - but you'd be able to hear a pin drop at night, and be safe from the street and pub noise."
14,827,"Jul 24 2009 	Will stay again	Unfortunately we only had one night in this hotel. Treated ourselves to one of the executive rooms and this was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The balcony didn't overlook the lock but that didn't matter as it was peaceful. All the staff we met were very friendly. As we had to leave at 8a.m we had an early breakfast and had the whole room to ourselves - that is a first for us! The area - Camden market is just a treat to walk around with all its interesting people, stalls and different foods to sample. We also found an Italian restaurant within a short walk which would be good for families if they wished to eat outwith the hotel.We will definitely book into this hotel again."
15,827,"Jul 20 2009 	Great hotel if you don't plan to stay in your room	Took my 2 teens to London and stayed in a double room. We had a disgusting view of the air shaft. When I called the front desk to ask for a better room (we are Platinum members), they told us that they would move us ASAP. We waited in the room for 95 minutes. When the porter came, we were moved one floor up, in the exact same location. Same view. I was told that &quot;all of the double rooms'&quot; are in this location in the hotel. The bathroom is outfitted nicely and the beds were comfortable. The Camden area is pretty funky and filled with street vendors. Mind your wallets/purses. It is a 10 minute walk to the London Zoo (find coupons before you go: it is pricy) Be aware that if you want to have a meal after 9pm, you will have to travel out of this area: all of the restaurants become 'pubs' and refuse to serve anyone with children under 18. We were turned away from 5 restaurants before finding a Chinese rest. that was happy to serve us. The breakfast buffet is standard fare, but the dining room is bright and the servers attentive. Although they were working on the plumbing and some other renovations, it was quiet and unobtrusive."
16,827,"Jul 17 2009 	Great location clean room good value	The hotel is conveniently located near the Eurostar station at Kings Cross, about half a mile away which is a 5 min bus hop or taxi ride. There is a Wagamama noodle shop that opens to 11 pm across the street. The beds are comfortable and the bath is clean. We only stayed overnight to catch the train but it was a great value for the room and location."
17,827,"Jul 17 2009 	Excellent location	I stayed here one night for a gig at The Roundhouse. Great location, right by Camden Lock. Easy stroll to The Roundhouse.The room was quite big but my bath water was luke warm. Mini bar. Breakfast was comprehensive but rather unexciting in the taste department. Would use again."
18,827,"Jul 15 2009 	Modern Hotel in a Lively Part of the City	Having stayed for one night at the Holiday Inn Camden Lock using my priority club points I can recommend this hotel to other travellers.The room was the standard layout of 95% of hotels around the world, although the room was on the smaller side it was faultless with quality. All fixtures and fixings were in good working order and the room was clean. Where quirky operation of things like the shower taps, safe, etc. an idiots guide has been written. The TV has the standard five UK terrestrial channels plus Sky News, Nickelodeon, TMF, selection of radio and hotel pay TV.Hotel has WiFi but no price is advertised, but it definitely was not free.Air conditioning was efficient if required. When I was there London was the usual humid muggy affair that it experiences during the summer and I had the window open for fresh air.I can understand the other reviews that mention the noise from the Lloyds Bar opposite, which with the window open could be heard but shut the double glazing and all was at peace. I did not find this a problem considering what a vibrant area Camden is.I had the full English breakfast in the hotel at 12.95 (9.95 continental) which was expensive but was buffet style and as I wanted it to last me all day I needed to fill my boots to the max. Quality of the food was good with a choice of two types of good quality sausage. The staff were very attentive, the amount of times they asked me if everything was alright was over the top.The hotels location is brilliant for eating out with many restaurants and food outlets within very close walking distance. The Lloyds bar opposite serves all day the standard pub grub offered by this chain, including breakfast at half the price of the hotel, although the quality of sausages does not match the Hotel.Eating out was easy and there is plenty of choice. Across the other side of the canal are multiple fast food outlets serving Mexican, Burgers, Indian, Chinese and Italian. I opted in the evening for Chinese at a cost of 3 for Chicken in Black Bean Sauce with fried rice. Although not filling for a growing lad like myself, would suit many, at this price you can always have a second. The seating areas are novel consisting of the seats of scooters.The tube station is no distance from the hotel to explore the rest of London.For the tourist, Camden is a good location to base yourself, although it is tube ride to the West End.To sum it up the hotel is as expected modern, clean and in a good location."
19,827,"Jul 14 2009 	Welcoming hotel in great location	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Camden town for 1 night although I wish we could have stayed longer! As a Platinum Priority club member we were upgraded to an executive room on the top floor wth a balcony which was fantastic to enjoy the lovely weather. It was also very quiet on this floor, didn't hear any noise from the streets below and it was a Saturday too.We ordered room service to eat on the balcony which I have to say was fairly reasonably priced for a London hotel, although I did have a problem trying to make the person on the phone understand my order but this was soon resolved by contacting the duty manager.We were offered breakfast for 9.95 pp when we checked in, its 12.95 if you dont pre book, but to be honest there are plenty of places in Camden Town where you could get a cheap breakfast. We love the area around Camden, very trendy and lots of great places to eat. We went to a Lebanese restaurant called Mezza Express, great value and tasty food.Would definitely stay here again especially if we can have a balcony room!"
20,827,"Jul 12 2009 	Good on weekdays noisy on weekends	Our flight from Los Angeles was early (!), so we arrived at the hotel around 10:00AM. Without checking to see if any rooms were available, the staff made it perfectly clear that we would not be allowed to check in until at least 2:00PM. That was a bit of a drag, as we had not slept on the plane.Once we were allowed in, the hotel was fine. The room was adequate, the bathroom nice although small. The lobby was plain and the bar area limited, but we didn't really care about those. We'd rate the hotel as three rather than four stars.On Friday and Saturday night, the noise from the pub across the street was intense until the wee hours. (We're not light sleepers, but this kept us awake.) Noise was not a problem on weeknights.Like others, we had booked through Hotwire, so we were pleased with the rate. We also liked the area, which we had not visited previously. It was colorful and interesting. Our overall rating of &quot;Very Good&quot; is significantly premised upon the locale. Wagamama (across the street) had good food at reasonable prices.We would definitely recommend this hotel for stays on Sunday through Thursday nights. On Friday and Saturday nights, we'd look for something quieter. We also wish the staff were a bit more accomodating."
21,827,"Jul 11 2009 	Great...	Like many others, we booked through hotwire and stayed two nights. Rooms are small but very very very well maintained - immaculately clean and ours seemed newly remodelled, especially the bathroom. I like the wall dispensers instead of those tiny bottles that are so bad for the environment.The area is great - so close to Camden Lock with a great variety of food and neighborhood restaurants (we had excellent Indian at the Masala as well as market selections for everyone); the towpath is a great, pretty, cut through to Regents Park and parts south as well as Primrose Hill etc. We loved being so close to the park.Note - there is an excellent Morrisons supermarket off the towpath in the direction of Regents Park - go up at at the Pirates castle and follow in the Primrose Hill direction. I think it's closer than the Sainsburys.I don't think the northern line is the most convenient for the tube, but the tube station is close.Excellent friendly front desk service.A great deal and a great place to stay for the price."
22,827,"Jul 9 2009 	Great place to stay	Had 7 nights exploring the area and loved it. Modern hotels are not the norm in London but this had all a leisure traveller could/want. Cannot understand why I got it so cheap through Hotwire ($79+charges), but it's worth lots more. The breakfast at 9.95 (if bought at reception) is nicely presented, although coffee is atrocious - hard to find good coffee anywhere in Britain. Wi-fi at 15 per day was outrageous - I cannot believe they have many takers at that price. I bought a 3G SIM for my iPhone and had most of what I needed for 1 daily.I had a view on the first floor on the outside. I was worried about the noise some reported, but soundproofing was fine."
23,827,"Jun 19 2009 	Ideal hotel for access on Northern tube line to the City	All rooms have a safe in the wardrobe, a hair dryer, a small ironing board and iron, an electrical trousers press, a writing table and office chair.The hair-dryer, iron and trousers press only work after you have switched on the electrical socket, and in the case of iron&amp; trousers press, also 2 buttons on the trousers pressThere's a big Sainsbury supermarket at 17 Camden Road, about 150m from the tube station &quot;Camden Town&quot;.Twin room:- two double beds- faces inner courtyard and has view of a wall 3m away- window is relatively small, about 0.6m x 1.2m and does not open properly, you can only tilt it to open about 20cm- if you don't really need the 2 beds, try to avoid these rooms Double room facing outward:- 1 double bed (1.50m x 2m)- big floor to ceiling window (1m x 2m), which you can open completelyExecutive room:- big roof terrace- 1 big double bed- about twice the size of a normal room- separate walk-in shower and bath tub- bath robe and slippers provided- weighing scales in bathroom- collection of little shampoo bottles, shower cap"
24,827,"Jun 18 2009 	Great Location Room and Service	This was the last 4 nights of our 3 week roaming trip through England and Scotland. Maybe we were extra impressed just by staying put for 4 nights. We too used Hotwire, (isn't everyone??) and booked further ahead so payed a little more than rates quoted inother reviews but still great value. Camden is VERY noisy at night and the glass dumping/recycling seems to start about 4:00 AM, just after the last of the drinkers has finally fallen in the canal. The canal is a great walking route. Nearby food offerings are mind-boggling. The shopping is very eclectic and entertaining as are the regulars in the neighborhood. Hotwire always drops us in a new place and this time it was a huge success. BTW, I'm impressed that the manager monitors these reviews and responds. Wish I had something to complain about..... Room 407, June 11 to 14. Cheers."
25,827,"Jun 17 2009 	Only one word to describe this hotel...outstanding!!!	We stayed at the Holiday inn - Camden Lock in London for one night as part of a three night London trip to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. We booked via Hotwire and were astonished to get this 4* rated hotel for $49+fees (total $63), an absolute steal for London.I contacted the hotel a week before the trip to ensure we got one double bed, and also gave them our Priority Club number which although we would not accumulate points as the hotel was booked via a third party, normally affords the opportunity of getting a better room or a view. I received a reply almost immediately from the Duty Manager on that day, Aurelio, informing me that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Lock View room with their compliments. Outstanding service, especially as the room was booked via Hotwire.We arrived at Camden Town underground station late morning, and soon found the hotel which is only five minutes walk from the station. As it was a Sunday, Camden was extremely busy but it was an easy walk.On arrival I asked very nicely if we could check in early (it was 11.30am, check in is 2.00pm) and although initially there was a doubt, after I mentioned we had email the hotel, she was more than happy to check us in. I can't remember her name but she was very bubbly and welcoming, as were all members of staff we met during our stay. She wished us a nice time, and off we went to the room.The room was very nice, with the aforementioned Camden Lock view, which was stunning. It was a double bed, very firm but comfortable, and there was also a desk and chair, and two chairs around a table. The bathroom was modern, if a little on the small size but all in all it was a lovely room and extremely clean.We headed off to Primrose Hill and the Camden markets for the rest of the day, all of which are a very short walk away (especially the markets). On our return to the room, we received a phone call, and were extremely impressed to be told a bottle of sparkling wine was on the way up with the hotel compliments!!! Another fantastic touch. Superb.We did not eat in the hotel, either for dinner or breakfast the next day. It was 9.95 for a buffet breakfast if you pre-ordered, or 11.95 if you paid on the day. It was a little expensive for us to be honest, so we headed to the Lloyds Number 1 next door (which is a Wetherspoons) and had two large breakfasts for the cost of one at the hotel. Very nice, highly recommend and also for a beer or two as well (probably not for breakfast though!!!).Camden was as I remember it from visits many years ago. Very busy, especially on weekends but with an amazing vibe. The food at some of the market stalls smelt so good, and it was nice to sit and have lunch overlooking the canal, watching the boats going up and through the Lock. We ventured out for some beers in the evening, and despite hoardes of people being there during the day, I was slightly disappointed that Sunday night was very quiet. Still it was good to get around a few of the local pubs, and after a takeaway pizza we headed back to the Holiday Inn for a nice relaxing sleep.I cannot recommend the Holiday inn enough. Obviously the Hotwire rate was amazing, but I would pay more for the hotel. Location is second to none for Camden, and it is an easy journey on the tube and only a short walk away. Add into that, amazing attentive staff and you have a winner. Highly recommended."
26,827,"May 31 2009 	Splendid Hotel and Location	I am writing this review because the information and tips from other reviewers are so valuable. Those tips really made our stay so much better.We stayed at this hotel from 05/25-05/27. We booked (prepaid) through Hotwire for three nights but our flight was delayed for 24 hours and we only stayed two nights. No problems at check-in at around 9 a.m. The room was clean and overlooked Jamestown Road. We were not bothered by noise other reviewers had problems with. Here some helpful hints. Grab you a little red Welcome to London 2009 on the rack when you first get into the terminal. It has a decent city map and a tube map. We took the First Capital Connect train (The hotels web site calls this the Thameslink) from Gatwick airport to St Pancras/Kings Cross. All the different train tickets can be purchased from the same ticket windows. Then we purchased two Oyster PAYG cards with 20 quid each at St Pancras/Kings Cross. (Actually 17 with 3 deposit which was more than enough for 2 days). The Oyster Card is the way to go. You have to switch from the train station to the tube (Underground) Northern Line north bound to Camden Town (One stop but can't be walked). There is a bit of walking to get to the tube station because of the ongoing construction. Just ask someone or look for the signs.Once you get to Camden Town exit and follow signs to Camden Market. Take a left on Jamestown and you should see the hotel. We did have breakfast at the hotel one morning. It was rainy and none of the cute roadside cafes were open. The hotel had decent food and reasonable prices. There is a Wagamama right across the street from the front of the hotel. My wife likes Chinese food but it does not do much for me. I preferred dinner at the Ice Wharf which is behind the hotel towards the canal. Tuesday night special was a 10 oz sirloin steak with chips and your choice of drink for 6.95. This deal can not be beat. But the way that restaurant works is each table is numbered (little bronze number on table surface). Pick a table and then go to the bar. Order your food and drinks, bring your drinks back and they will bring the food to your table when its done. I am saving you twenty minutes of sitting at your table waiting for the waitress who never comes to take your order. I like this concept and think it would work well in America.The canal and market area is a fun to walk around in. But plan a few hours to walk through Regent's Park. Go back towards the Camden Town tube station and follow the signs to London Zoo/Regent's Park. I could not believe how beautiful and spacious this park was in the middle of all that humanity. You can pick up another tube station on the other end. Baker St I believe.We bought wine and a some food at Sainesbury grocery store. Go back towards the light but don't take a right to go to the Tube Station, keep walking to the bottom of the hill. Ten minutes.Our departure flight was out of Heathrow so we tubed it down to the Picadilly Line. Make sure you have the right tube because the Northern Line splits in two south bound. If you do get on the wrong south bound line switch at Euston to the Leicester Sq stop. Know which terminal your flight is leaving from as well. One west bound Picadilly Line goes to Terminal 4, 1, 2,3 and one goes to Terminal 5, 3,2,1. We returned our Oyster Cards to get our deposit and whats left. Both were paid with the same credit card but for some reason, one card was returned in cash, the other credit back to card.The National Gallery is a must. I am not an Art Aficionado but did manage to recognize many of the paintings. This was very impressive.St Pauls Cathedral was great. The views from the top were awesome. The signs for the underground stations have a blue line that says Underground through a red circle. The bus stops look the same but has a red line through a circle.You wont get to see everything. Have fun and enjoy what you do."
27,827,"May 19 2009 	Won't be going back.	Definitely won't be returning. While the location is great, this is certainly not deserving of the 4 star rating it has been given. The room was tiny and claustrophobic with low ceilings, and when I first got in the a/c was blasting and the room was freezing. When I put the heating on, it didn't do a thing but blow tepid air. You could feel the springs in the bed and I was sore the next day, and the TV was probably 10 years old, with only 5 free channels. There were finishing tiles missing in the bathroom (which also was tiny...you couldn't get around the door between the toilet to the bath if the door was partially open) and the design details weren't thought out very well (barely enough clearance under the tap to wash your hands!). The hot water was intermittent (!!), and NO FREE WI-FI (what is this, 1987??). There wasn't even free Internet in the &quot;business centre&quot; downstairs. The room was also quite noisy (bars outside, and early in the morning, delivery trucks and glass bottles being dumped in the recycling from the bars across the way). If you're going to be in such a &quot;lively&quot; area, at least have double glazing! In the middle of the night one night, there was a loud alarm that went off in the room for about 5 seconds, startling me awake. I can only assume it was the fire alarm, which they seemed to be having trouble with when I was checking out. They only had a combo shampoo/body wash mounted to the wall in the shower (cheap), so I had to go and buy a bottle of conditioner (what a waste, can't bring the leftover on the plane because it's a liquid). The food was good, rooms were clean and staff were friendly, but the displayed list rate in the lobby of 250 GBP for a standard room is a TOTAL joke. i got the room for $84 USD a night, and I still feel ripped off and very disappointed."
28,827,"May 17 2009 	Good hotel but watch out for the beds	We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights cause we had some business in London. The first night was horrible. We got a lovely room, but the neighbors were watching TV all night very loud so I could not fall asleep, not even with earplugs. The receptionist could not do anything about it, cause they could not identify which neighbour it was, so I had a sleepless and very stressful night. We got for the second night a new room, less lovely but still ok, no disturbing noise in the night, once the pubs closed in the evening, however we did not check for the bed quality, so in the evening when we went to bed, 2 feet of the bed just gave in and we had to sleep on a half tilted bed. In the morning we found that 2 feet were broken of the bed and have simply been tucked under it, so that new guests would not realize till you actually lay down. PS: having breakfast in the hotel is not worth it, we walked 2 street up to find a lovely hidden pub that served the best English breakfast I have ever eaten..."
29,827,"May 6 2009 	Good hotel but watch out for outside noise	My partner and I stayed in this hotel for the Bank Holiday of May. There is nothing wrong with the hotel itself, except maybe for the door between our room and the next. We could follow the conversation from our neighbors quite good. I don't know if there is a door between every couple of rooms, otherwise I would advise to explicitly ask for a room without.The room itself was clean and the right size. The only thing that could keep us from booking here again is the outside noise. As it was good weather during our stay, there were a lot of people outside having fun (plus a wedding in the hotel on the last night). As this has to be done in a quite loud way, this kept us from having a good night's sleep. Earplugs are highly recommended. I don't know if the noise was also this present on the back side of the hotel (with view on the canal)."
30,827,"May 1 2009	Great stay until duty manager said the wrong thing.	We just checked out of the Camden Lock Holiday Inn today. This would have gotten a higher rating from me except for the little glitch at checkout. First the positives. Everybody, except the last guy we dealt with, are friendly and informative. The area is very interesting and in some respect more interesting than the typical tourist areas of London. The tube station is about a 5 minute walk away and it is very easy to get anywhere you want. The area is a madhouse on the weekends but that just reinforces how interesting the area is.The room is probably larger than most European hotel rooms. We booked one with 2 double beds. It was clean and the beds were ok. Housekeeping was an issue. There was only 1 glass in the bathroom and it never got replaced or washed out. After the third day without a new bar of soap (and our existing soap becoming a sliver), we had to ask the front desk for some. They put some shower gel in the shower on the third day. The room was still clean but replenishing the supplies was a bit lacking.The restaurant is ok for dinner. In fact, we hate heated up pub food so we ate in the hotel twice and it was fine. The servers are very nice and friendly. Breakfast was ok...but you do get sick of buffet English breakfast. Luckily, there were sticky buns, cereal and fruit to pick from if you got tired of bacon, sausage and black pudding. The eggs come scrambled or you can ask your server for fried, boiled, omlettes etc and they'll bring it to your table. There was also baked beans, tomato, and cold cuts. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and quite delicious. The servers could try to refill coffee and tea more often but it's a minor quibble.The lobby has a lounge with a bar and very comfortable seats. I actually enjoyed sitting there.Bad stuff... internet wifi was 15 GBP per 24 hour period. We decided to forego the hotel internet connection and purchased a T-Mobile internet dongle and pay as you go service instead ... as suggested by somebody on the Tripadvisor forum (Carphone Warehouse, T-Mobile etc are just down the street near the tube station). However, the room we were given, on the 1st floor, was like a cave. Our view opened up on some roof area with walls on either side. This meant our connection to a G3 signal was horrible if we sat where the desk was located (near the window). Our signal improved as we got closer to the hallway and was great if we sat in the lobby. Oh well. There are worse things than sitting in the lobby lounge. It was actually quite nice.Now for the check-out glitch that has annoyed us. We booked the room using a CAA/AAA which meant we had no breakfast included. At check-in, we were asked if we wanted to purchase breakfast vouchers for 9.95 GBP each. We decided to do so since it would save us time and the price wasn't too horrible. We told them that we couldn't use a voucher on our last morning though since we had an early train to catch. She gave us 5 vouchers for 5 mornings of breakfast. One evening, we realized that we couldn't use another voucher because we had a bus tour that we had to leave for early in the morning. We asked the front desk if it would be possible to return the vouchers for a refund. If they said &quot;no&quot;, we'd have a VERY quick breakfast before leaving on our tour otherwise, we'd get breakfast while on the tour. The front desk clerk said it was no problem and took back the vouchers and said they would take the charge off of our bill. When we checked out, not only was that breakfast still on our bill, they had charged us for breakfast for the day we arrived too. We arrived at 2 pm...no way for us to have eaten breakfast. The duty manager, who checked us out (Osman) reluctantly took off both breakfasts. &quot;Reluctantly&quot;, I say, because he first questioned when we arrived as if he didn't believe me when I said we arrived in the afternoon and then chastised us for returning the other voucher. He told us that in the future, we would not be allowed to return breakfast vouchers. I said, &quot;In that case, in future, we won't stay here.&quot; He replied that was our choice. Hold on here....we ASKED if we could return it and they said yes. And now here's this guy saying we shouldn't have been allowed to return them and blaming US for this &quot;problem&quot;. If they had said we couldn't have returned it, we would have stayed for breakfast. When we told him this his reply was it must have been somebody new at the desk and he/she shouldn't have allowed it. Well...fine...but BLAME and chastize your employee, not the customer. Talk about ridiculous. THAT soured an otherwise good experience at this hotel and if if they intend to employ such a person as a MANAGER, then we won't be staying there again. Ironic since we had just said to ourselves that we'd come back without hesistation. Well...too bad...lots of hesitation now. Somebody needs to be sent on a course for customer service. It's amazing how 20 seconds or ill chosen words can leave a bad taste in your mouth."
31,827,"Apr 26 2009 	Wonderful stay!	Our room (standard one) was very clean and large. Amazing wiew on the canal. The continental breakfast was really tasty and abundant. The staff was nice and helpful.Excellent location, almost three street market nearby, many restaurants and pubs.Definitely, we will recommend this hotel."
32,827,"Apr 23 2009 	Best in Camden Town	I chose the hotel because of the location in Camden Town, where we wanted to spend some time. Me and my partner are not heavy partygoers, but we like live music. We ended up not to find any bar playing live music and were too tired to jump from bar to bar.So location was perfect for us. In the reception everything went as it should and we were helped when we asked best way to get to Stansted airport. Breakfast was very good standard level continental breakfast, not extraordinal. The room was spotless clean and there was enough space. Standard mid-range hotel room. There was some noise from the street in the evening, but nothing disturbing when we went sleeping. Most disappointing thing was the double bed. It was too narrow for two normal size adult. The mattress was very unconfortable giving me backache, probably because not designed for two or missing proper insulation on top of springs. With a better bed the experience in hotel would have been very good."
33,827,"Apr 23 2009 	Lively location	This is a good hotel, however it is good to be aware that Camden is a lively place, especially on weekends, with many visitors to Camden market. If you like that this hotel is a good choice, if you dont stay elsewhere.The hotel has been upgraded with design features that work well, both esthetically and functionally. Underground station is a five minute walk."
34,827,"Apr 13 2009 	Good value hotel you get what you pay for.	NO real luxuries, nothing really left out. It's a solid place to stay, about 5 minutes walk from the Camden Town Tube. The area gets very busy on the weekend and it takes a bit more time to get to the hotel during these times. However, once you arrive at the hotel you forget about the somewhat questionable characters outside. The hotel is clean and fresh. They have a coffee bar and restaurant inside, or there are many restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate viscinity. Our room faced an inner courtyard, not very exciting, but it was the only triple room availble. The room was clean and made up everyday. We never did get them to replace the empty shower gel and once day they &quot;forgot&quot; to take away our dirty cups and replace them with clean ones. We just called the reception and they brought us new ones. The hotel also agreed to call us a taxi for our 6:00 am departure, but they forgot to order it and only did so after was asked at 6:10 when it was coming. We got this hotel on priceline and you do get what you pay for. It was still a great deal for a London hotel, but the attention to detail was lacking."
35,827,Apr 13 2009 	Good Hotel in a good location.	Excellent Hotel in a great location. Close to Camden Lock market and only a few stops on the tube to central London.Very helpful and service minded staff. Great breakfast as well.Fantastic value for money and would definitely stay here again.
36,827,"Apr 5 2009 	Good Hotel excellent location	My wife, kids and I stayed a the Holiday Inn Camden Lock for 5 nights and got a clean, quiet, nice room. Excellent location, nice staff at reception and in the breakfast room made it good value for money. We will definitely stay there again when visiting London. However, 2 things would have made a better impression: When making the reservation we asked if a room with a view would be available (Gold member, 5 day's stay made me think this would be possible) and the view we've got was the brick wall of the adjacent building 4 meters away; the housekeeping staff might need more ressources since on 01 April our room was only made up after 5 p.m. (returning after jogging along the beautiful Regent's Canal and finding the cleaning cart blocking the entrance to the bathroom was not perfect)."
37,827,Mar 26 2009 	A real treat	As a trainer I get to see a lot of hotels throughout the UK and this one really stood out for me!My room was stunning with views of the canal. My conference room was spotless and the organisation faultless. Lunch for the delegates was plentyful and tasty.After work there was colourful Camden to explore and we found a nice restaurant in 5 minutes walk from the hotel.The staff was friendly and helpful throughout .I really enjoyed stying here and look forward to my next visit.
38,827,"Mar 23 2009 	Good Value for London	As mentioned, this is a good value for London. We got this on Hotwire for $65 a night after taxes. The hotel staff was nice. Although our room was not ready when we arrived, they let us check-in our luggage so that we could begin our sight-seeing, and they also held our luggage for us on the day of checkout. The rooms were clean, but dont expect anything fancy; they are ikea style. The room also had an iron and hair dryer which was great. You will have to pay a lot of $$ for internet access. The train station is just a 5 minute walk. I don't know how to describe the area, but it reminds me of a flea market. There is a Barclay ATM near-by (for Bank of America customers). The train ride is about 15 minutes to central London (Piccadilly Stop). There is also a fun night bar next to the hotel, with drinks at 99 gbp. However, if your room faces this bar expect some noise at night. Also across the street is Wagamama which is an eatery with good food popular among locals."
39,827,"Mar 19 2009 	Absolutely the best value for the money in London	We stayed at Holiday Inn Camden Lock in March 2009 and we thought it was an incredible deal. We basically got the room for $72USD, which is incredible for a hotel in a prime London location. When we checked in, we asked about a canal view room and they said that would cost 30 pounds extra, so we said, just give us the best view that you have. This, it turned out, was better than a canal frontage room. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the Camden Lock footbridge and street bridge! We had a perfect view of Dingwalls and the Ice Wharf directly below and in front of the room. Really no noise at all, except in the morning when the JD Wetherspoons Ice Wharf emptied out their bottle take for the night, sweet music to us! By the way, the Ice Wharf pub has incredible deals on drink and food, but we favored our friends down the block at the Oxford Arms Pub, which had great food and great personal service. The Oxford Arms took the time to ask about us and looked after us, very highly recommended place, one block away from Holiday Inn Camden Lock. The staff at hotel were very good, and location excellent, and no problem with anything. We love the primrose hill area, and this place is within easy walking distance without the high price tag. Very highly recommended."
40,827,"Mar 3 2009 	Nice hotel pity about the management	Stayed in this hotel at end of January. First impressions were good. Staff on reception seemed helpful and bar and food staff very nice. However during stay things got bad.Firstly the complimentary tea and coffee tray never refilled. Ended up on last day with just a sugar. Despite asking the hotel staff if could have this re-filled. The cleaning of the room only happened twice during our four night stay.Secondly due to the snow had to book another night. What should have been a simple exercise took five hours and alot of stress. As extra night was paid by someone else they had to send an email with their credit card details. They did this asking for room rate confirmation six times with no answer. Rate that paid was different from what was quoted. Luckily had evidence of this. As several emails were sent to hotel but no answer the bill payer had to change their credit card details.Now a couple of months on Holiday Inn and this Holiday Inn still have failed to answer e-mails regarding the over payment. There web site doesnt allow you to complain .Plus the Hotel Management at Camden Lock obviously cannot be bothered.If you try to book an extra night through their reception,then beware. Have stayed in many hotels and despite the nice area and hotel facilities would never stay here again. They obviously dont care about customer complaints or credit card issues"
41,827,"Feb 19 2009 	Nice hotel in an interesting place	We came early at 10 am. The normal check inn was at 2 pm, but they arranged a room for us 11 am. (Although there was a little lack of communication between the people in reception. We had to argue with one of them again when we came back 11 am) We had to pay 25  extra, but they gave us the room. We had also requested a quiet room which we also got.The housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a very good job with our room. Overall a good hotel."
42,827,"Feb 17 2009 	Great Value and Location + Friendly Staff	Just completed a weekend stay (3 rooms). The hotel has a great location, convenient to the tube as well as many interesting pubs and restaurants. The area is lively on the weekend, and there are large crowds in for the market. Note that the tube closes on Sunday afternoons due to the crowds, so you'll have to make the trek one stop north or south - no big deal.Front desk person 'David' was more than helpful resolving our request for a twin-bed room for one of our 3 rooms. All hotels should have someone like this who can deal with a customer request with logic and common sense and come up with a solution that works. Thanks David.All the staff were friendly and helpful - especially the housekeepers who were challenged on the Sunday due to all the checkouts. While later than usual, were friendly and apologetic for the delay on this busy day.The hotel its self lives up to its rating. Everything was clean and polished meeting our expectations for a Holiday Inn. We had a great stay, and highly recommend this friendly and convenient hotel."
43,827,"Feb 17 2009 	Neat Hotel probably expected more.	Neat hotel, smallish rooms, probably expected more. We did find someones bed socks in one of the beds which indicated that the linen had not been changed, contacted reception and they had this corrected, however it had set the mood of the hotel off on a bad vibe. Location is good if you want to be out of the city but not too far, markets are around the corner as too is the subway which is an easy ride into London. There are several good eating places within a block of the hotel."
44,827,"Feb 10 2009 	Good service great location good value	After an overnight flight from Vancouver with 2 young girls, we made the mistake of taking a taxi to the hotel (using a car hire would have saved money). 80 pounds later we arrived and were assigned a room that smelled of cigarette smoke! After 15 minutes waiting in the hallway with our luggage, we were switched to the twin room next door (the rooms facing inwards have no view, but they are very quiet). After that initial hiccup service was excellent. We had problems with our wi-fi and were immediately given two free hours. The hotel and rooms were very clean. The location was great: five minutes walk from the tube, across the street from Wagamama and a short walk to Sainsbury's for groceries (and beer, god bless English licensing laws). We were only a short taxi ride to King's Cross when we moved on. To top it all off, we got a great deal on Hotwire. We would definitely stay here again."
45,827,"Feb 2 2009 	Good hotel in London	Good hotel in the spikey clothes district of London. Large rooms with moderate wear, but clean. This is located in the &quot;goth&quot; section with lots of interesting clothing stores. Typical of US style hotel, but, as is the case with most UK hotels, subtract one star. All non-smoking, charge for internet. Ask for a quiet room as street side rooms are probably noisey. Turn right out of Camden Towne tube (Northern Line) and left two streets down. Friendly staff, but because of business, early check-in was not possible. Camden station is closed at 13:30 on Sunday due to crowds."
46,827,"Feb 1 2009 	Good hotel experience	We booked our stay through Hotwire and paid 95 USD per night. Friendly and helpful staff. Most parts of the hotel are quite newly renovated. The design is quite minimalistic and modern. The standard room we stayed in was quite nice and had a partial view of Camden Lock. Modern, but quite small bathroom. All in all we have no reason to complain. But the next time we will stay in London we will probably go for a hotel with more personality and charm."
47,827,"Feb 1 2009 	Great location. Shame about the noise!	What a wonderful location this hotel has. Right on the waterside, with stunning views across Camden Lock to the Victorian warehouses which now house Camden Lock Market, it's perfect for a weekend getaway. The hotel itself is very well appointed. The rooms are ultra clean, comfortable and well equipped for both business and leisure travellers. The desk staff were friendly and helpful and located us, at our request, well way from the adjacent Wetherspoons pub which earlier reviewers had said could be noisy. We were also able to leave our bags after check out and pick them up later. For service and design our stay was first class. However, there is a significant letdown here and one which would make me hesitate to re-book. The sound proofing between rooms is virtually non-existent. Why a company would build such a beautiful looking hotel in a wonderful location and then construct it so that visitors can't sleep because of the noise from other guest rooms beggars belief. Cheaper construction costs, I guess. Seems a false economy though to build a hotel where sleep is difficult! This could be one of the reasons why Hotwire has recently downgraded this hotel. This is a great place to stay for many reasons. Just bear in mind that the quality of your rest may be entirely dependent on the behaviour of fellow guests (as well as on how much they have had to drink!)."
48,827,"Jan 27 2009 	Excellent value and location for central London	Paid 63 on priceline, 62 on hotwire for this hotel and thought it was excellent value.Great location in Camden Lock, five minutes walk away from tube to Central and City of London. The location itself is quite an attraction too.Modern hotel with nice rooms and functional bathroom.Would recommend even for the non priceline/hotwire rate."
49,827,"Jan 22 2009 	Great Value perfect location	The Holiday Inn Camden is in the perfect position for visiting The Roundhouse (our primary reason for going). Over looking the lock, and it;s bars, is a lovely view, however, at night it is very loud. We were shattered so managed to get to sleep. However, when we go back in October, we will ask for a room on the other side of the hotel.We paid 82 for a double with breakfast. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. Our room was spacious, with a desk for working on a pc, a table and 2 chairs, and a comfortable bed (pillows a little sub standard-but slept on worse!) There was tea and coffee, and a kit kat. The mini bar was well stocked, although we didn't use it. The bathroom was smallish but scrupulously clean, as was the room.When we realised we had forgotten toothpaste, they very quickly sent up 2 baby tubes of Colgate and 2 disposable brushes.The breakfast is buffet style. Very well laid out and a good choice. Very good service from pleasant and attentive staff. We asked for strong coffee and got it, most unusual! You could have eggs cooked in a variety of ways, my poached and my husband's fried were just as they should be, no grey stringy bits on the white of the poached, like I have been expected to eat in other hotels. The bacon was a little softer than we liked, and they were more than happy to crisp it up. They played popular classics in the background, and we felt very relaxed.We are going back again in October. Thoroughly recommend it. Of it's type, it's very good."
50,827,"Jan 20 2009 	Nearly Perfect	Most hotels whose management reads and responds to Trip Advisor reviews are well run properties and this Holiday Inn is no exception. In fact, it is perhaps the cleanest and best maintained hotel in all of London. I found the staff to be well trained, pleasant and professional in every respect. My room was immaculate and very comfortable with a spectacular shower. As another reviewer commented, the vertical clearance between the faucet and the washbasin could be a bit greater but thats a very minor point. Everything in the room was in good working order and the in-room safe was very convenient for storing valuables. The location is excellent being only a short walk from the tube and about 10 different bus routes. Of course, if youre used to Knightsbridge or Mayfair, Camden Town will be a bit of a culture shock. But if you appreciate the lively quirky street scene and hundreds of market stalls, the area is perfect for you. And if you walk east on Jamestown Road straight into Hawley Crescent, you come upon a huge Sainsburys just five minutes from the hotel. While I highly recommend this hotel, I suggest you not accept a room facing east (about one third of the rooms do). These rooms overlook a semicircular multipurpose building and have a nice view of the Regents Canal to your left. On the ground floor of that building just opposite the hotel is a Wetherspoons Pub/Restaurant (Ice House) open nightly until midnight. While the pub itself doesnt create a disturbance, many of their patrons loiter outside the entrance and along the Canal creating quite a commotion. These young people have mastered the art of yelling and shouting. In fact, some of them outshine the big stars in the West End, at least when it comes to volume! And Im not referring to New Years Eve or a lovely spring evening. Even on a cold and rainy January night, these revelers could be heard loudly through the closed windows of the hotel room until way past midnight. Im not sure even a monsoon would subdue these professional screamers. Given the proximity to the hotel, it is unfortunate that hotel management cant encourage Wetherspoons to employ security personnel to deal with this issue which has been reporter by previous reviewers as well. And if you think the noise ends at midnight or so, think again. In the early morning, delivery trucks bring supplies to Wetherspoons and the loading dock is just adjacent to the customer entrance (an absurd design) and was about 15 feet from my room. While not nearly as disturbing as the evening carrying on, the early morning commotion from the delivery trucks is yet another reason to stay on the opposite side of this hotel if you value peace and quiet.One other point is that internet access is via weak-fi rather than wi-fi, at least in my room. With either my internal wifi adapter or an external USB adapter, the signal strength and connection speed were terribly inadequate. After noting the dismal connection, I did not buy a voucher (4 pounds for one hour) for obvious reasons. Not sure of the location of the wi-fi routers but the system was useless as far as I was concerned. There are also no roaming agreements (e.g. ipass, Boingo, etc.) so the only way to connect is to use the hotel provided low speed service.Notwithstanding the noisy neighbors and weak wi-fi, this hotel represents and excellent value and a fine place to stay in London. Perhaps I could have changed rooms during my stay, but there are so many better things to do in London than spend time repacking and unpacking. Anyway, this is a clean and well run hotel and for its strengths, Im giving it the highest rating."
51,827,"Jan 14 2009 	Great Spot in Camden Town	I chose this hotel for both the price and its proximity to where I used to live in London. I don't know if I'd recommend it to first timers unfamiliar with Camden, although get yourself an A-Z and you should be fine. You should also be used to crowds, as navigating Camden High St on the weekends can be overwhelming! :) The staff were very helpful and friendly, and kindly set me up with very early check in. The room was comfortable and overlooked a bit of the Lock (and the Ice Wharf). I stayed in a standard room, which was more than sufficient. I felt the room was an excellent size for London, but I should point out that I was traveling on my own! There was enough closet, shelf, and drawer space to set myself up for the week, a desk and chair I kept telling myself I'd use to get work done, and a small table with chairs if you didn't feel like sitting on the comfy double bed. There was also a fold out ironing board and iron attached to the trouser press, which came in handy. The shower and bath were clean, pleasant and powerful, although the curtain not going round all the way was rather annoying - but a small thing. Housekeeping kindly heeded &quot;do not disturb&quot; (seems common sense, but it's been a problem in the past) and I was able to laze about as needed when I felt ill. I didn't make use of the mini gym or the restaurant. My only real bother was that the walls were somewhat thin (a common hotel issue), so the amorous folks next to me were very apparent...luckily I always travel with earplugs! Bonuses: Jamestown Rd. is off of Camden High St, so close to where you need to go (Markets and transport) but much quieter. Also across from Wagamama! On the same street there's a Cafe Nero (which has gluten free brownies, if you care...it made my day), and two pub/diner places that look nice enough. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I felt it was excellent for the price and proximity to transport, and I will be staying here again."
52,827,"Jan 7 2009 	Excellent	The location of this hotel is excellent. When we checked in we were upgraded, the room was amazing and the balcony was huge; it overlooked the lock and on the other size we could see the London eye!!. The staff were really friendly and we will be staying here again next time we are in London."
53,827,"Dec 18 2008 	Convenient clean	Got very good value for a Friday night only through priceline ($59+taxes=77), and was happy with the hotel. The location is 10 min walk from Camden Town tube and close to Camden Markets, restaurants, shops, etc. The bathroom has a modish faucet installed which makes washing extremely inconvenient. The shower curtain does not go over the whole bathtub. On the morning of Saturday reception called us to tell us that check out time was 11am and if we leave after noon, they have a fee schedule to charge us per hour."
54,827,"Dec 7 2008	Requests not granted	Only booked 1 night and requested quiet room with nice views, as a priority club member I thought our requests would be met, unfortunately they were not. Our room was on the 3rd floor, opposite the lift and facing a noisy road, needless to say we could not sleep a wink. So much for being a priority club member. Expensive for the room we were allocated."
55,827,"Nov 17 2008 	Great fun location	As an older women traveler, I thought the neighborhood was great and always felt safe, though I was not out past 10pm. There is always so much activity. I stayed for three nights. It was a great place to explore that part of London before I met up some family and moved to a different part of London. The Holiday Inn was sort of an interesting place to stay, compared to the craziness of Camden Lock. It has a great location right on the lock. If you go go certain directions, the neighborhood changes greatly. I walked to Regent's Park one afternoon, which was very beautiful. There are many restaurant options near by in every direction. We did Wetherspoons, several pubs, Wagamana, a little Italian restaurant. for breakfast...many, many choices with differing clientle and levels of services. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel. Our room was clean, big, and the front staff were very helpful. The tube was very convenient. I went out to Hampstead Heath for a walk one day, the British musuem another day. I took a taxi from Pancaras, though in restropect I should have just taken the tube."
56,827,"Nov 8 2008 	Good location clean comfortable and comtemporary rooms	Having visited Camden Market before, we particularly wanted to stay in this area when we attended a wedding in Hackney. It's worth checking a few websites for rates as each did differ. We stayed for a long weekend. Arrived from the Midlands and managed to drive straight there without going into the congestion charge areas. The hotel has no car park of its own but you can pull up outside to off load and then park at a secure car park a few streets/short walk away. However, note that this car park (recommended on the hotel website) only takes cash, so remember that when you are leaving! We booked a superior room and were given a free upgrade upon arrival to an executive room which was very spacious, nicely furnished, contemporary, clean and comfortable. It also had a large balcony with table and chairs that had great views towards the London Eye . We were on the 4th floor which was quiet. The enormous bed was VERY comfortable. The full English breakfast choice and quality (included in our rate) was more than sufficient, even for my vegetarian needs. Some reception staff didn't smile much but others were very helpful in assisting with booking tickets for a Saturday evening event and with directions for the most straightfoward/quickest route to the Town Hall in Hackney. The bellman was very welcoming and helpful.We like the lively buzz of Camden and the ease of getting around. There are plenty of eating/drinking venues within easy walking distance of the hotel, as is Camden Town tube station and the local railway line.We take weekend breaks in London 2 or 3 times a year and won't hesitate to stay here again and have already recommended it to others."
57,827,"Oct 25 2008 	What a surprise!	My room had a view of the regent's Canal. It was comfortable and upbeat.What impressed me the most was the customer service. They helped me reschedule my flight home. When asked for good restaurant recommendations, one young man actually called his cousin. Kind, courteous, and 5 star.The area is easlily accessable by tube and busses"
58,827,"Oct 17 2008	Good enough with a couple of small hitches	We got a good rate from the hotel's own website (http://www.holidayinncamden.co.uk/), which beat the rate from the Holiday Inn corporate website. Staying only one night, it was a brief visit, but first impressions were good.Check-in was painless and pleasant, and we were allocated a room on the second floor. There was no view to speak of, as this seemed to be one of the rooms that faced on to the inner courtyard. However, this did mean that there was very little noise from outside. We were glad about this, as the air-conditioning didn't seem to cool the air. I'm only making an assumption, but some hotels switch off the air-conditioning in the Autumn/Winter to save money, so the cooling is just a fan. It seemed that this was the case at this hotel, or else the air-conditioning was broken. As it was a warm day, we put the air-con down as low as possible, but it barely cooled the room at all. Instead, we kept the window open to cool down.Also, when first settling into the room, I noticed a few dark and curly hairs in the bed, make-up (or something similar) on the duvet cover and a dirty pillow. I called down to reception to ask for new sheets, and they sent the duty manager to the room. He inspected the bed and profusely apologised, before sending housekeeping along with replacement sheets. A short time later, he reappeared at the door with a bottle of Merlot and a couple of glasses. I must say that we greatly appreciated the gesture, as it shows a willingness and desire to keep their guests happy. I'm afraid I don't recall his name (we had a big night...) but we thought him tremendously helpful and polite. The hotel is very well located in Camden, and is a short (a leisurely 5 minutes) walk from Camden Town station, and seconds from the many interesting shops on Camden High Street. It's also just over the canal from the Camden Lock and excellent Stables markets. On the same road as the hotel is the Camden Brasserie, which we found to be very good indeed. You can view their menu on the restaurant website, if you're interested. Just Google it. It's also barely 5 to 10 minutes to get to Koko and the Dublin Castle, if you're in town to see a gig. There's a Strada and a Pizza Express on the same road as the Dublin Castle, if that's what you like.We didn't use the bar or restaurant of the hotel, but the reception were most accommodating when we asked to leave our bags with them until approx 8pm on the day of checkout. We were happy overall with our stay, and consider the rate to be competitive when compared to other London hotels. Next time we're in Camden, we'll certainly stay at the Holiday Inn again. I've just marked them down a little (I think 3.5 is a fair mark, but it's not possible on tripadvisor's system) to reflect the fairly basic nature of the hotel and the cleanliness problems we had in the room. But we were left with a positive impression, largely due to the duty manager and the general helpfulness of the staff."
59,827,"Oct 11 2008 	Very Good Hotel	We stayed at the Holiday Inn, Camden last week.We found that the Holiday Inn staff were both friendly and helpful.The room, and en-suite bathroom were clean and comfortableThere was a very good early breakfastThe hotel is in a good location, right at the side of Camden Lock, and between between 5 and 10 minutes walking time from the Camden Underground station (depending on walking speed).There was a handy facility to leave our bags at the hotel on our last day. We wanted to do a bit of sight seeing, before we began our journey home in the afternoon. Very Good"
60,827,"Oct 5 2008 	Great stay	Stayed for 2 nights at the hotel and couldn't find fault if I tried. We arrived to find our rooms weren't quite ready but were given complimentary drinks from the bar, which were gratefully accepted after a long drive south. Our rooms were ready 10 minutes later. Our interconnecting rooms were spotless and more than adequate for my family. Breakfast was as good as anything we've had before if not better and the bar was adequately stocked for that nightcap or two after a long day touring the city. I read all the reviews I could find about the hotel and didn't encounter any of the problems a small number of previous guests reported, so yes, the water was always hot, the towels changed and plentiful, the electricity worked as did the TV and the lifts. There was a small amount of noise from the bar across the street and there is a Witherspoons on another side of the hotel. This could get problematic in the summer when there are more drinkers outside and you want your window open so think about this when booking. Location was perfect for us. A 5 minute walk to the tube and a 10 minute tube trip will see you at the centre of London. We drove down to London and left the car at a secure off site car park about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, which only cost us 20 for 48 hours! As for Camden the area, well it's certainly lively and vibrant. We didn't eat or drink in the area and only used it as a base but the sights are worth seeing. We consider ourselves very young at heart parents of two teenagers so it wasn't too much of a shock but if you're a bit straightlaced it could come across a little intimidating. To sum up don't worry too much about the negative comments, those people must have been used to staying at the Hilton or Marriott. This is a crackin hotel in a great location with really friendly and helpful staff who couldn't do enough for us. We'll definitely be back."
61,827,"Sep 30 2008	ideally located in camden	The hotel was ideally located amongst the hustle and bustle of Camden; right on the canal and next to the market. It stands opposite a Wetherspoon's pub, The Ice Wharf ( the pub takes its name from the adjacent Ice Wharf, which was built in 1837 for ice imported from Norway). Wetherspoon's pubs have a good reputation for quality and economy - amongst the lowest pub prices in GB - but also for boisterousness on Friday &amp; Saturday nights. Our room overlooked the pub and was surprisingly quiet. There's plenty to do in the evening in the area and the underground is close by. The rooms were very comfortable and clean; the staff were friendly and helpful."
62,827,"Sep 22 2008 	Ideal Location	I have just returned from a weekend at the Holiday Inn Camden waith my husband and 2 children 13 &amp; 11. ROOMSWe found this hotel to be very comfortable, but the rooms were quite small. The bathroom door almost touched the toilet in front when open, the bathroom was tiny, just enough floor space to get out of the shower! The room had tv with some satelite channels, there was a desk and chair and also a small table and 2 chairs, as well as a small double bed. The rooms were very clean and had modern bright decor.LOCATIONThe location was definately the best bit about this hotel. It is right next to Camden market, which is a very interesting place to visit. The main high street shops are also right nearby. There is a wetherspoons pub next to the hotel, which is good for cheap drinks and food. The tube station is a 3 mintue walk and is very easy to find. I would definately stay here again if the price is right. We got our room as part of a theatre deal with lastminute.com, but i don't think i would pay the full standard price to stay here."
63,827,"Sep 13 2008 	I'm loving it! Great Hotel - Poor Parking except for blue pass	On my second visit in a year ( the first was a free night on my priority points) I turned up dressed like a tramp after a long trek at 23:40 and was welcomed warmly, identified as a priority club member and, as there was an upgrade availble, promply upgraded to a suite on the top floor, overlooking the lock and Jongleurs with an awesome balcony and a very nice room indeed. I nearly cried because it was already time for bed before I had really made the most of the situation.However, previous stays were in the standard room solet us be objective.The rooms are pretty standard holiday inn UK rooms, not to be confused with US style rooms, but are large and well equipped, very comfortable, in fact my friends on the last trip slept five in their room with no problems.DO NOT open the fridge and poke around, it is all computerised and you will have to pay for anything you move, unless you sweet talk the very understanding duty manager who was the most helpful such employee I have met in ages.Parking is tight and very rare but there is a good indoor car park a few streets away and it isn't a fortune, blue pass holders are quite correctly given a space in the hotel yard, when there is one available.Camden lock is 20 yards away and the London Underground is less than 250 yards away (it is in zone 2). The markets, the street stalls are all within a short walk, but not one you will be wanting to take late at night.Sunday is the best day to visit as the whole area comes alive and the hotel is an oasis of calm in the middle of the madness.The staff here are very well mannered and really helpful and it is now my favourite London hotel.Book online and save a few bob and pay no more than 130 for bed and breakfast, if you cant get that price, join the priority club, thern phone them and tell them you had that price last time you booked, they can't always do it though so be nice and try next time, but a bit earlier.Going back next week and I can hardly wait!"
64,827,"Aug 29 2008 	not a patch on oxford circus	NOT A PATCH From a priority card holder. I stay at holiday inn /express and accumilate a number of points during my stays. In the last week myself and wife stayed at Oxford Circus in a suite where we had complimentary bottled waters, biscuits , robes and slippers 2 televisions ,overall excellent. This week we took our daughter to a show and through the call centre booked on recommendation a family room at Camden lock. We were advised that we could possibly have a room overlooking the lock so we went for that . On arrival told family rooms are all inner facing room so no lock facing. Also our room use to be a smokers room but we wouldn`t know. We were then given voucher to exchange at the bar for complimentary bottle of water. Our room to say the least was a tad smaller than what i expected espicially as i had read that rooms with 2 double beds where on the large size. It seemed no larger than the rooms i stay in on my own. The fridge in our room had the most expensive priced drinks for minitures again compared to the HI Oxford circus hotel As for the area i have to agree with others that i felt at times a little intiminated after we had arrived back from the show late at night. What disapointed me mostly was that in booking both hotels the points debited were the same for each hotel but i can assure you that Camden was not a patch on Oxford Circus."
65,827,"Aug 18 2008 	Value for money	For an affordable, clean, london hotel, decently located then you can't go too far wrong than with the Holiday Inn at Camden Lock. I have just spent the week there and have found everything to be ok and value for money. I think we would all like everything to be perfect and I did have a few little moans about the bathroom being very compact, air con too noisy to sleep with on, but some of my moans were out of the hotel's control like noise late evenings/early mornings from party revellers in the street below. The hotel is ideally situated right next to the canal and the famous Camden market. The tube is literally five minutes walk with a good selection of international restaurants to hand and Regents Park also close by.All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to revisit."
66,827,"Aug 7 2008 	Brilliant Hotel	Very friendly Staff, Clean comfortable. Brilliant location. Would recommend to anyone wanting to be in the heart of Camden."
67,827,"Aug 2 2008 	Brilliant hotel!	I chose this hotel on the basis of the location, and also the positive reviews on this website. Before booking I contacted the hotel directly and the manager Luis Pedro was very helpful in getting me a special deal for my stay. A collegue rang me directly to arrange my booking and Luis followed this up with an email to check everything was ok which I was thought was excellent customer service. When we arrived at the hotel on 27th July, we were too early for check-in but we were hoping to leave our bags while we went to watch the Lion King Musical. To my surprise, our room was ready early - excellent! Check in was fast, and the lady on the reception desk (Hani/Hana?) was helpful and friendly. Our room was on the first floor and while the temperature outside was extremely hot (very unusual for the british summer!), our room was lovely and cool. We had booked a triple room but our room had two double beds and was a good size. Both the room and the bathroom were also very clean. When we came back to the hotel after our day out, we discovered that our television did not work. I rang reception and they were extremely helpful and eventually moved us to another room down the corridor where the tv worked fine! The beds are very comfortable so we had a great nights sleep and unlike some hotels, we couldn't hear much noise from outside. The location of the hotel is excellent if you want to explore Camden - its a few minutes walk to the famous market, and there are plenty of cafes and pubs if you are looking to eat out. We found a diner just a few steps up from the hotel which we had lunch ate - great cheesy chips and friendly staff! The tube is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel which is ideal for exploring the rest of London. Overall, a great hotel and I would definitely stay here again if I was coming to London."
68,827,"Jul 29 2008 	Amazing Peace and Relaxation in Camden	I used to work in Camden years ago and it was great in my twenties and full of life. It's still full of life and a wonderful place to be, though now I like to be able to get a break from the crowd and it's so nice to be able to find peace and style in a hotel in the centre of Camden.We picked this hotel as it was close to the Forum in Kentish Town and you know where you are with Holiday Inn. Well, I thought I did, this isn't like any Holiday Inn I've ever stayed in, it's bright, has a style all of it's own. We were lucky enough to book a room on the top floor with great views and a balcony, below to one side Camden lock, on a warm sunny day a hive of people having a great time way into the night. Though as soon as you close the door to your balcony you would not have a clue what was going on outside.The room was a good size, very clean, very bright and well thought out in design. Great bathroom and nice touches, such as well designed furnishings.Staff very good and with a great knowledge of the area.This is a haven of style, peace and great service in the heart of Camden."
69,827,"Jul 21 2008	No Response	After reading the visitor's review dated June 13, 2008, I became concerned about keeping my own reservation to stay in July, and so I waited for the manager's response to appear here at TripAdvisor, which I'd noted, was usually prompt and sincere. When 10 days passed and there was still no response from Holiday Inn over the electrical concerns of a guest, I decided to take action and contacted the Camden Lock location via email, requesting a response to my concerns about the safety of their electrical system prior to my July visit. I NEVER HEARD FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOTEL!I canceled my reservation.Now that I'm back from my visit to London, I see that the manager of the hotel did respond, but it took him a month to do so. I appreciate the seemingly thorough response given, but I wish he'd done so in a more timely manner. I might have overcome my concerns about the safety of staying at his hotel and kept my reservation."
70,827,"Jul 17 2008 	Great hotel in good location.	Stayed in the Holiday Inn at Camden a couple of times with work and had a very good experience each time. The room I stayed in on my first trip had double doors overlooking the Camden Lock which was beautiful. The room itself was a good size and included a small study desk which was handy. The decor in both the room and the en-suite was very smart as well and everything was clean. The dinner in the hotel restaurant was excellent. On my second trip I was going to be given a room on the other side of the hotel but asked if they had any available on the canal-side. I was advised that there would be a live band playing at that side of the hotel until about 11p.m but, if I didn't mind this, then it was no problem. That particular night I was back at about 11.30 or so and the seating area in reception was having its floor covering replaced - the work was all done with minimal disturbance and everything back in place the next morning. All the staff I encountered were friendly too. The only flaw I can remember - and this is a nit-picking thing I've noticed in a few hotels - is that the bath/shower is not properly sealed where they meet the wall or panelling. In this case it meant that the otherwise attractive veneer had begun to stain and swell where water had got in behind. Still a great hotel in good location though."
71,827,Jul 17 2008 	Truly Wonderful Hotel	My fiance and I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and can't rate it highly enough. Over the past few years we have stayed at several hotels in London including The Conrad and a few other 5 star hotels but we love the Penthouse rooms here and we love the area so we frequently return here. The staff are amongst the most helpful we have met and don't judge people. We can go to an event in jeans and leather jackets or another event in posh frocks and diamonds and we are treated with the same respect; something we love. The service is excellent and the food is lovely.The last time we stayed at the hotel we had a couple of minor blips one of which was dealt with immediately and the other was dealt with by the manager to our complete satisfation on our departure.We love this hotel so much that we have chosen to spend the first night of our honeymoon here before flying abroad in Sepetember and I do not for a moment doubt that it will meet our expectations.
72,827,"Jul 6 2008 	I LOVE Camden Lock Holiday Inn..would 100% stay again!!	We had a BRILLIANT stay!!! Would 110% stay again..i look forward to it!!The Room:My boyfriend and I booked a standard room and it was beautiful..really lovely comfy bed, tv with lots of channels, tea and coffee making facilities, a gorgeous bathroom (great shower), great furnishings and much more!The Location:Great, safe area. Safe parking only minutes away. Immediate access to the famous Camden Market and very close to Camden tube line. Wouldn't change the location at all, absolutely brilliant! We walked outside at about 1 in the morning and felt safe! Perhaps only a tiny disadvantage is that the hotel is very close to a busy Weatherspoons..so there is a tiny bit of background noise..nothing serious though!The Staff:Wow, I must say that the staff were fantastic! They helped us with every aspect of parking in the area..they gave us free dental kits and lots of information of the area and were just generally really nice to chat too! One of the receptionists was called Starr and she was lovely! The restaurant staff were also great..really friendly and fun!The Food:We only had small meals for dinner at the restaurant..great food and great service! We even stayed there for lunch despite the fantastic food options in the area..it was delicious..they also make fresh smoothis! One important thing...The breakfast is AMAZING...everything you could imagine..yum yum we were very impressed!! We also ordered room service which was prompt and tasty!Extras:The intention of our stay was to visit the famous Jazz Cafe to see Victor Wooten perform...who did we meet at the hotel entrance? Victor Wooten and his bad!! It was great!! If you are intending to go to the Jazz Cafe then it is likely that the performers will be staying at the Holiday Inn!!!Also, as we only stayed one night we had to leave our luggage somewhere secure..they were happy to take our bags and put them in a special secure room..we kept going back to take items from our bags and they were happy to help!Also, the hotel is open 24 hours..very useful!Thank you VERY much for a lovely lovely stay..i really was blown away by the service..it really, honestly was great!!!Thanks again, Momo xoxoxxooxox"
73,827,"Jun 18 2008 	Would never stay here again -- travellers stay away!	I will never stay at another holiday Inn, nor will I recommend your organization to anyone. In fact, I will go out of my way to tell whoever chooses to listen about my horrible experiences at your hotel.? On May 28th, I informed the reception area that the air conditioning was not working in my room. They told me they would take care if it. I also asked for more towels. Nothing was done.? On May 29th, I again informed the hotel I had no air, again I was told it would be taken care of. Once again nothing was done and no extra towels were left.? On May 30th, I asked to speak to the manager. I was changed to another room.? Extra towels were provided.? On May 30th, my daughters TV did not work in her room. A fuse had blown.? On May 31st, my TV did not work. A fuse had blown.? On June 4th, my daughters TV did not work in her room. A fuse had blown.? On June 10th, at approximately 1 am in the morning, I heard a large SNAP, and saw a flash of light (I was asleep) and smelled something burning. My TV had blown out  it was not turned on  and had caused all the electricity in my room to go out. I called reception and 2 gentlemen came up (without flashlights  they asked me to hold the room door open so they could see with the light from the hall), but could not fix the problem. As it was so late and I had been asleep, I told them I would move in the morning. Morning came and I had to dress/shower in the dark. I finally had to call reception. I was moved to what I thought was a  nice suite. The manager also told me an adjustment would be made to my bill. ? On June 11th, I went to unplug my mobile phone from the charger, which was attached to the outlet with a grounded UK adapter. I felt a large shock, heard a snap and there was a flash  my charger was burnt out and my hand and the charger were black. This was an Apple charger and had been used before with no problems, in this hotel and in a hotel in Rome with no problems. Reception again came up and reset the electricity. They seemed unconcerned that my charger had been destroyed and that my fingers were black. Upon check out on June 12th, reception had no record of an adjustment made to the bill and there was no manager at the hotel to speak to. My mobile phone number was taken and I was told I would receive a call before our plane took off at 11 am that morning. I received no call. And I have not received any calls since.This hotel should be closed and its entire electrical system re-worked. It is a dangerous situation and an accident waiting to happen. I paid my entire bill in good faith, but fully expect to be refunded for my inconvience and for the destruction of my mobile charger ( cost $80 US dollars).A few other things to bring to your attention:The towels in this hotel are stained and very, very rough. An earlier review stated they have been replaced.There is no security chain on the door and no way to double lock the door.Housekeeping is very irresponsible and does not reply to requests. We ran out of toilet paper twice.The only positive thing about this hotel is its location and the staff in the restaurant. Other than that it is the poorest quality hotel Ive ever stayed at in my entire life.I will never stay at another Holiday Inn. I will not recommend your hotels to anyone and will do what I can to tell family, friends etc. about my experiences.I had expected more of your organization; I have never stayed in a hotel that I was afraid to sleep in for fear of an electrical fire. The thought of it is insane.I expect to hear from you regarding a credit for both my inconveniences and for the destruction of my property. Photos were taken and are being mailed to your corporate offices."
74,827,"Jun 14 2008 	Worst check in experience!	I would like to share my experience in this hotel. I arrived with my daughter at around 14.00 and I was told that check in was not possible until around 15.00. Then of course at 15.00 the reception was full of customers checking in and I was told that our room (prepaid through internet website) was not ready yet. After waiting for about an hour we were given free coffee and then they told me that the actual room I had booked was not yet available and if I took a regular one instead it would be quicker! It was the worst check in experience ever! The first thing one wants arriving from a series of flights is to get into the room and a have a shower, so that then the day will not be lost. The second thing is that when someone prepays for a specific type of room, this room should be ready upon arrival!"
75,827,"Jun 11 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	Decided to stay here cos it looked newer than other Holiday Inn's &amp; we needed 2 double beds (with 2 kids) &amp; something more than basic. Cost 6 to get to in a black cab from Kings X station. Read others' mixed reviews &amp; was impressed by the fact that hotel management actually read &amp; respond to reviewers comments, which is partly why we decided to stay there.Room very clean &amp; spacious enough for 4 people. Bathroom very clean. Found staff in restaurant and bar very helpful and friendly. Good selection of buffet breakfast - hot &amp; cold included in our price. Camden Lock is a fantastic location daytime. We weren't intimidated on an evening, but I see how some other people might be coming back from Tube or bus after dark. There are plenty bars, cafes, shops nearby. Markets are brilliant with wide selection of funky stuff &amp; diverse foods. We were a short tube ride on the Northern line from central London (5.90 all day pass for Zones 1&amp;2 - most of central London areas), or the number 24 or 29 (can use your travel pass or 2 single bus journey from central London)buses stop nearby.We had our kids with us &amp; we were fine, but wouldn't necessarily recommend area for older nervous people or families with young children, after hours. If you like alternative lifestyle stuff, this area is great. Canal is next to hotel &amp; you can take boat to London Zoo, or down to Little Venice (unfortunately we didn't have time). Wetherspoons pub next door doesn't allow people to drink outside after 9.30pm through week, not sure about weekend. if you don't eat (breakfast) in the hotel there are plenty of cafes roundabout the hotel &amp; over in the lock &amp; market areas &amp; stuff near to the tube. Didn't drive there but there is no parking &amp; not sure how near to hotel you could park or if I'd have wanted to leave a car nearby after dark. It is better to book through Holiday Inn directly &amp; join their Priority Club before you do as we saved loads, &amp; had 2 proper double beds &amp; not just a sofa bed This also gave us a midweek late checkout (2pm), complimentary use of the gym, cooked breakfast (or hot/cold) included &amp; a newspaper. Would definitely stay there again &amp; would recommend it to many others."
76,827,"May 16 2008 	Great Base	Stayed at this hotel in early May 2008. LOVED IT. Camden Lock is a quirky area. Yes it was a little scary as the sun set and it was super crowded with people of questionable character but it was still a great base for London sightseeing. The hotel was a short three blocks away from the Tube. However since it was so crowded, it could easily take you 20 minutes to get to the hotel. There at tons of cool shops and outdoor stalls to peruse through. We didn't have the courage to hang in the bars or pubs around there but thats ok. There's a Wagamama across the street and Wetherspoons downstairs but we didnt get a chance to stop by. There is a huge Sainsburys two blocks away where we stocked up on groceries, cheap wine, and bear. Loved that! The hotel itself was very modern and very clean. I was very pleased with this hotel. However, I must say that the towels were horrendous. We stayed three nights and had them changed every day and every new set had stains and bodily fluids and teh quality was worse than a Super 8 Motel. I was shocked. It totally didn't match the quality of the hotel itself. The linens were extremely rough and had stains on them. I've stayed at motels with softer sheets. But hey, other than that, this hotel was EXCELLENT. I would defenitly stay here again but i'd bring my own linen and towels next time. (And I'm not even that picky when it comes to this stuff in hotels)."
77,827,"Apr 8 2008 	Nice hotel great location	Stayed here for one night and thought that the hotel was in a great location, was clean, staff friendly and efficient, rooms nice and of a good size and there was a good selection of food at breakfast (all buffet). Also bar prices were reasonable - having been stung at other hotels in London!!!All in all I would recommend this hotel, just watch out for the addition of tax when booking with the hotel direct."
78,827,"Apr 2 2008 	Loved it!	Stayed in the hotel for 10 nights. We heard a little noise and the beds were very firm. However, everything was new and the room was relatively spacious (we had friends staying in the heart of London who could barely squeeze around the bed). The staff was courteous (although we had trouble with the maid service due to a language barrier when we requested more towels). The location was great, there excellent pubs in every direction for night fun, an expansive market good for shopping and people watching, and it is only a short walk to the underground. Another perk, Starbucks is just around the corner (a perfect situation for a Seattlite like myself). A walk along the lock is also very nice, within 2 miles: Regent's Park, the London Zoo, Little Venice, and King's Cross. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
79,827,"Mar 25 2008 	A Perfect London Hotel	We stayed here over the Easter weekend and I have to say we couldn't fault them (except possily the kids channel not working on the TV but to give them less than an excellent rating due to this would be churlish).The staff are the friendliest at any London hotel I have stayed at. In fact they give the Disney Hotels a run for their money :o) . Polite and friendly at all times they couldn't do enough for guests. The hotel is clean and new and the rooms a good size. Its very quiet (not sure what the last reviewer meant when they said it was loud, they should try staying at the Novotel Euston!) The rooms were very well serviced every night and the breakfasts were first class. Oh and the location for the tube and the Northern line made getting around a breeze. As you can tell we very much enjoyed our stay and will stay there again next easter. Almost forgot...the kids got toys and a gift bag during check inn. Its touches like that which make travelling with kids much easier!"
80,827,"Mar 23 2008 	Noisy with poor management. Good location though.	I dont know how this place gets such a good rating. Ive stayed here twice now and both times Ive had something go wrong. Stay 1  Receptionist lied on check-in and the duty manager was nothing but rude. Noisy at night due to the location of the hotel opposite the main bars of Camden lock  through to 11pm. Not good for early nights. Stay 2  At about midnight on my first night I was awoken to a group of other guests entering my room. Apparently there had been a mix up with key cards. Manager barely apologised. Still noisy due to the bars and a loud snorer next door. However, it does have an above average Holiday Inn restaurant (note that this doesnt mean its an above average restaurant!) and is located just down the road from Camden Town tube. Its also great for visiting the bars which will otherwise keep you awake until they shut. Rooms are a good size and reasonably up to date. With some decent management and staff, and some better double glazing, it could be so much better, but despite giving it the benefit of the doubt for my second stay, I dont think Ill be returning. For those collecting Priority Club points, there arent any other Holiday Inns close by, but in central London try either the Bloomsbury by Russell Square or Kensington by Gloucester Road (not the Kensington Forum)."
81,827,"Mar 2 2008 	Very Good Hotel	Stayed two nights in one of the penthouse suites at the top of the hotel:Reception staff very helpful and friendly,as were all of the staff during our short stay.Room was excellent and had superb views over camden.Restaurant staff very helpful and polite during breakfast,and unlike many hotels that we have stayed in they actually had the vegetarian sausages that many advertise but are unable to provide.On the whole a very enjoyable stay,and would be happy to return."
82,827,Feb 2 2008 	Great location for enjoying Camden and easy access to central London	Holiday Inn Camden Lock is in a great location for enjoying the sights and sounds of Camden. Hotel feels very new with clean and spacious rooms with fairly small bathrooms but great showers. Would highly recommend for enjoying Camden and London - only 15 mins or so on the underground and you're in the centre of London.
83,827,"Jan 20 2008 	Home away from home	I've stayed in this hotel numerous times over the past years, so they must be doing something right. Time to share my experiences...The main reason I keep coming back is the quality of the rooms. All rooms are definately reasonably sized (particularly for London) and all come with seating areas and desks, as well as french balconies that usually offer good views. Ask for the rooms in the back to get very scenic views over the canal, and try to avoid twin rooms unless necessary, as those only have windows that open to an inner court with airco units. Once you obtain an upgrade, chances are you'll be stunned by the room size, and the lovely terraces that come with the suites and the exec rooms.The hotel just opened a few years ago, and has been kept very well. The rooms are always very clean, and you won't find broken lamps and tv remotes here. Staff is usually friendly, though sometimes a bit unexperienced. Room service food is not bad at all and comes at very reasonable rates.A few cons: the TV offers only a handful of channels; the bathrooms are very functional, but a bit smallish and the towels have seen better days. The rates have gone up considerably recently so it's important for them to work on these points.A lot has been said about the Camden neighbourhood. Camden is not very touristic or glamourous, though it is very lively and offers you the chance to experience everyday London life straightaway. There are many great pubs and good places to eat, as well as a very diverse set of shops. The amount of traffic these generate means you're never alone so I consider it very safe. Also just minutes away is the beautiful area of Primrose Hill and Regents Park, where you can walk for hours to relax and to enjoy the almost rural atmosphere.Thumbs up for this place; I'll be back next month!"
84,827,"Dec 30 2007 	Great Stay in Camden Holiday Inn	A great hotel with very helpful staff.Camden Lock is not one of the immediate tourist areas that comes to mind when visiting London, we chose this hotel after a recommendation from friends, who were impressed at the room sizes and cleanliness. This cannot be overlooked when paying top dollar in the capital, having previously stayed in rooms no bigger than our box room at home!However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is close to a good selection of shops and restaurants this may well be worth considering.The hotel is modern,clean and light with enough space, a good bed and a pleasant bathroom.We had the breakfast buffet which was very good but ate across the road at Wagamamas for our evening meal which was great.The hotel is a very easy walk from Camden Town tube, and is a short cab ride from Euston, St Pancras, Marylebone and Kings X mainline stations.We took in a show in the evening and found Camden to be really well placed on the Northern Line. We were from hotel to the theatre in twenty minutes!The major drawback for the Hotel is its lack of parking. The nearest parking is 10 minutes walk away, in an underground car park. This car park is not open 24/7. So if you need to leave before 8am you must re-park it close to the hotel the night before. We will definitely be stopping again."
85,827,"Dec 28 2007	good location	stayed there one night in nov,nice clean,lovely comfortable beds.ate lunch was good,ideal for easy access for camden market,bit of a mix up width payment tho,we were over charged for room,was more than was quoted but was re embursed over phone after realising.would recomend going again."
86,827,"Dec 23 2007 	Stayed On Business - Great!	I stayed here for business purposes for 4 nights and really enjoyed my stay. I was upgraded to a lovely room overlooking the Lock area and the Market. I only ate in the hotel one night but the food and breakfast were fine. I love the vibe of the whole area and this particular Holiday Inn appears to carry this off better than other Holiday Inns i have stayed in. The staff are very friendly and although there appeared to be Christmas parties at the hotel every night I was never bothered by noise. I would recommend this hotel for a Lively, well located stay."
87,827,"Dec 3 2007 	Great London base	A great hotel with very helpful staff, the Camden Lock is not in an area that would immediately appeal to most. It is not near the shopping centre, and is a little bit off the beaten track.However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is close to a good selection of eclectic shops and restaurants this may well be worth considering.From the time of arrival we were made to feel welcome by the staff, who seemed genuinely welcoming - don't underestimate how rare this is in London.The hotel is relatively modern, and appears to have been developed at the same time as the whole of the Camden Lock was re-developed. The rooms are exactly what one expects for this class of hotel. They are clean and light with enough space, a good bed and a pleasant bathroom.The restaurant is very typical of modern hotels, with acres of wood flooring, cafe style tables and chairs and lots of glazing onto a very unremarkable street. But it serves a very good breakfast - with eggs to order that arrive promptly.The hotel is a very easy walk from Camden Town tube, and is a short cab ride from Euston, St Pancras, Marylebone and Kings X mainline stations.Sitting in a very steady neighborhood the hotel benefits from a mix of stores that will have appeal to most people, especially those in the Camden Lock Market. All the normal high street shops are also on the High Street, but don't bother with them unless you really need something, as their really big brothers are all on Oxford St which is only 15 minutes away by tube.To match the eclectic retail variety of Camden Lock Market, there is a wide variety of restaurants, from Hache - the specialist upmarket burger restaurant, to Vietnamese, to Mexican, to Greek all within a short distance.Also within walking distance is Regents Park and London Zoo, probably two of London's most forgotten attractions. The British Library is also very close, as it sits between Euston and St Pancras stations.The major drawback for the Hotel is its lack of parking. The nearest parking is 10 minutes walk away, in an underground car park. This car park is not open 24/7. So if you need to leave before 8am you must re-park it close to the hotel the night before. All in all a great find at a great price for London, and great if you are arriving from the North/Midlands by train."
88,827,"Dec 2 2007	Good value great location	Enjoyed our short stay here.Hotel room was spotless and well featured, suitable for both business and leisure. Good value for London too for the rate obtained. Location is superb for visiting Camden with it being just a 2 min walk from the main strip, and 5 mins from the Underground station for trips further into the City. Oh, and it's 5 mins from the superb Jazz Cafe.. check it out!Recommended )"
89,827,Nov 24 2007 	good base for business or leisure	This is a nce large hotel and well situated for business in london or leisure and exploring. (2 tube stations from Kings Cross / St. Pancras.Hotel is just off Camden High Street. Plenty of shops and very busy at night.There is also &quot;The Spirit of Havana&quot; interesting little place which is in a courtyard area about 5/10 mins walk from the hotel. Lots of little Cuban kiosk / cafe like things.Hotel wass immaculatley clean. My room was huge and had 2 double beds. Great breakfast and bar prices not too bad. Would definitely stay here again.
90,827,"Nov 5 2007 	lively area	lovely hotel spotlessly clean,.staff helpful.breakfast was ok but very disorganised .hotel in a very lively area but no problems ,it was a bit far away from the theatre that we were going to but we sussed out the underground so was not too bad .behind the hotel was a wetherspoons must say the food was very nice and reasonable in price.when i come to the theatre again i dont think i would use this hotel as it is too far away .otherwise no complaints ."
91,827,"Jul 31 2007	Great Hotel	Great hotel, excellent rooms and very modern. The breakfast was also great you were spoilt for choice. Just what you need to set you up for a day in London!The location was greaet, right in the heart of Camden, overlooking the lock and market. It was only a 5 minute walk down the highstreet to the nearest tube station.There's a cheap Weatherspoons restraunt just at the back of the hotel and there is a Wagamamas just across the road. Wouldn't hesitate to go back, although the area late at night did make me feel a bit scared; but couldn't have asked anymore of the hotel. EXCELLENT!"
92,827,"Jul 7 2007 	Great room 	We stayed at the Holiday Inn for 4 nights. Our room 415 was surprisingly large with a full window opening onto the canal. It was a smoking room but there was no embedded odor at all. The room had a comfortable double bed, desk &amp; chair, sitting area with two chairs &amp; a table, large dresser and closet -- there was plenty of space! Also there is a laptop size safe, very convenient.The view of the boats &amp; market area was very enjoyable, there are a few outdoor patios across the canal but the noise was minimal at night. Most eating spots closed by 11PM. I would agree with other reviews that this area would not be ideal for families, we didn't see many children around. The main streets nearby (Chalk Farm Road) and the market are fairly crowded, so it would be difficult to manuver with strollers/luggage. The side streets (Arlington Rd) and Jameston Rd (where the hotel is) are easier to get around if you are walking from the tube station, particularly with an umbrella! The Camden market is sprawling, eclectic, there is plenty to see from art to jewellry to vintage to punk. Also being less than 5 min walk to the Camden Town tube station was very convenient to get around London.We had the buffet breakfast included in the rate, which had a good selection but there are so many cafes nearby I wouldn't bother to pay extra at the hotel. The hotel restaurant staff were very friendly. A few nearby restuarants that we enjoyed: Lockside Lounge (in camden market, good drinks &amp; casual food), Fogg's (on chalk farm road, amazing food &amp; desserts, beautiful spot), wagamama (nice Japanese food across the street from the hotel - it is a chain restaurant we don't have in North America).There is also a grocery store nearby (sainsbury's) if you need it.We took a side trip out of London and were able to leave part of our luggage at the hotel for 3 days which was a great help. It was a great experience, I would highly recommend this hotel especially with the high prices elsewhere in London. If you are looking to see the sights or shopping, you can get around so easily from Camden."
93,827,"Jun 15 2007	Simple and Good	This is hands down the best Holiday Inn I have ever stayed in. The room was very comfortable and well-equipped, and the staff was very helpful and kindly switched me to a non-smoking room upon check-in, despite not having such a room &quot;available&quot; when I booked online. The location is great for tourists. Simple, clean and comfortable--highly recommended."
94,827,Jun 1 2007 	fab	we really enjoyed our weekend at this hotel. we went to london christmas shopping and really enjoyed waking up to the hustle and bustle of camden town. i dont think that this hotell is for older people or families as camden can be a bitt intimidating at night. the staff here were very pleasent and the room was clean and modern
95,827,"May 11 2007 	OK hotel Dodgy area	You know what you are getting with a Holiday Inn, this was one of the better ones. Decent size room, very quiet where I was located and fair breakfast. My London colleagues told me that the area was going places. Well if it is I missed that bit. Camden Town itself is a bit of a dump and as others have commented you have to get past at least half a dozen drug pushers to actually get to the hotel, walking from the tube station. I stood out like a sore thumb dressed in a suit and pulling my luggage at 7.00 in the evening and felt uncomfortable. Still the streets were busy enough and nobody directly hassled me. The next morning the streets were much cleaner of both rubbish (from the nearby market) and the puchesr, but I wouldn't take my family to this hotel."
96,827,"May 9 2007 	Really very good	Disappointing check in experience, Booking request was for a quite room location (I appreciate this is an oxymoron in Camden Lock), I didnt even get the key card to the first room that was allocated (313) and when I arrived at the second (216) the girl had allocated a room directly over looking the adjacent pub and outdoor drinking in area  I later discovered this was also over one of the hotel function rooms  not very impressive.The situation was rescued by some particularly good customer service from Alex who sorted me a room (101) on the street side, much quieter than the adjacent canal side but perhaps less scenic  effective sound proofed full length door style windows, good standard room  absolutely no complaints. All staff was all very helpful, welcoming and smiling as I came and went throughout the stay.Location is ideal, just off Camden High Street, 5 mins. from Tube. Hotel management seemed very aware of noise nuisance, the TV that restricted max volume control, together with interactive TV messages asking guests to be considerate of noise levels when coming in to the hotel late at night. Management also sent a note to each room warning of possible private party noise, also a nice touch, but as it turned out I heard absolutely nothing.Breakfast was Ok, but after the first 5 supplement for the Full Monty didnt feel that this was worth the extra. Unfortunately they also have no idea how to serve English breakfast tea, tepid water served in a pot will just not do.On the whole this was really a very good experience, and I suspect much better service than other London hotels. Thoroughly recommended for location and value but not perhaps for a quiet weekend, although outside drinking seemed to be restricted after 21:30/22:00. Area could be a bit intimidating for some but is mainly restricted to the High Street area."
97,827,"Apr 16 2007 	great but...	The Holiday Inn at Camden Lock is an absolute steal. You'd be hard pressed to find accommodations like it for the price anywhere else in Central London (the sign in the lobby said a standard room was 200/night but booking through Travelocity was significantly cheaper). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  every time we left or returned, the front desk would wish us a good day or welcome us back. When we checked in, I made a request for a room with a canal view and were given a 3rd floor room directly on the canal  perfect. The window was actually a door that opened in (no balcony but it didn't matter) which allowed us look out onto the stalls being set up across the canal, a great way to start each morning. The room was modern and roomy. The only thing that was of any concern was the toilet, as it was attached to the wall, not the floor, and every time I sat on it (I'm 125 lbs), it creaked and shifted a bit! The &quot;but...&quot; has to do with the neighborhood. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it (as I was traveling with a boyfriend and had steel toe boots) but I could see why some previous reviewers had negative things to say. The Camden Market area attracts a certain type of character (dodgy/drunk) at night and if you are, for instance, alone and older or have small children, you will probably be more comfortable elsewhere. Also, there are bars (the kind you drink in, not the kind to keep out burglers) surrounding the hotel, so it's pretty noisy until late at night. The closed windows do reduce noise significantly but you can still hear the occasional shouting. But if you're up for a good time and aren't bothered by people offering you &quot;skunk&quot; when you return at night, then look no further. You will LOVE this hotel."
98,827,"Apr 6 2007 	Enjoyable stay	My girlfriend and I spent a long weekend in the Camden Lock Holiday Inn at the end of January. The hotel is nice, staff are friendly and the breakfast is great. Camden is a vibrant, eclectic area. We saw drug dealers operating in broad daylight around Camden bridge but the hotel is a few minutes walk away and we did not feel uncomfortable."
99,827,"Mar 19 2007	Really great! Camden is lovely!!	This is a great hotel for such a good price!! My parents stayed here last year when they came to visit me. Our room looked pretty much like the one posted in the review below this one. Really comfortable, modern and a great size for London hotels. It's europe, everything is a bit smaller here!INFO ON THE AREA:-lived and worked in Camden for years and the area is FINE! at night there are a few shady looking characters on the high street but they are harmless and more annoying than anything. -a great location with tons of buses going there from every part of town and like 10mins by tube and bus to downtown attractions. Very close to 3 major tube stations, can walk to one in a few mins. -The High street and market is VERY busy during the day on weekends, but the hotel is right beside the canal and it's a peacful little place to sit in front of.-The area is sorta is eclectic and 'alternative', meaning has some excentic looking young people and shops, although it's changed over the years and you can get mostly very mainstream clothing for good prices. There is also a great antique market. It's a very vibrant area and has nice restaurants and bars. -We never ate in the hotel, don't bother when there is so much on your door step. but beware of some of the noodles and food in the market some of it tastes a lot worse and greasy than it looks especially if it's from the people yelling out prices trying to sell it to you!!got good price on Lastminute.com!"
100,827,"Mar 6 2007	Great Off the Beaten Path London Location	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Camden Lock in January while attending a conference just off Trafalgar Square. Within an easy tube ride (the Camden Town tube stop is just 5 minutes walk away) and bus commute of, and a mere 30 minute walk from, Trafalgar Square, staying at this hotel lets you experience a lively part of London many visitors miss. My spacious room had a view of the canal and Camden Lock and put me steps from the shops, market, and concert venues that this part of London is famous for. There are nearby restaurants for every taste and the hotel has a nice restaurant and convivial lobby bar. I got a very good rate for this hotel on Priceline and can highly recommend it for anyone who would enjoy experiencing a hip part of London."
101,827,"Feb 18 2007	Too many problems	Stayed here for eight nights with my family, 2 adults and two children (aged 8 and 13). Let's take the negatives first:-  Wasn't too sure about cramming 4 people into one room for eight nights so I called the hotel before I booked and was assured that the room was plenty big enough and they'd never had any complaints about the size. The room we were given was tiny. Just big enough for the two small double beds (140 cm wide, apparently standard continental double) and not much else. Certainly no cupboard space for our needs. Tiny bathroom (you have to dodge between the small bath and toilet to open the door). The window was the size of a postage stamp with a view over the rear ventilator. We complained and were told the hotel was completely full and they couldn't give us a larger room or a second room, even though we offered to pay full price. Spent one night crammed in like sardines and complained again the following morning to be told exactly the same. However, we contacted the booking agency who spoke with the hotel on our behalf. One hour later, they offered us a choice of eight spare rooms and we moved into a pair of interconnecting rooms on the fourth floor. These rooms were the same size as the original room but with one double bed in each the room wasn't so cramped. Nice large windows with a good view as well. Nothing out of ten for service so far. Other problems were numerous but relatively minor. Double beds are small and we found them over hard; One of the two lifts was &quot;Temporarily&quot; out of service for our entire stay; Wireless Internet costs 4 for 30 minutes and was out of service for long periods of our stay; Front desk couldn't lend me either a pair of scissors or a standard power supply lead for my laptop: The desk chair fell apart when my eight year old sat on it. The hotel bar is sterile and reminds me of a doctors waiting room. Same problem with the restaurant, it's more like a canteen - OK for breakfast but you wouldn't want to eat an expensive meal there, especially with all the alternatives Camden has to offer. Beware of the Hotel Photos on the website. They all appear to be taken from Functions Rooms or Executive suites situated on the Regents Canal side of the building. Neither the restaurant or any of the standard rooms we saw enjoy this view. Finally, when I came to pay the bill for our two rooms I was told that I had to pay for one of the two complimentary daily papers I received even though I was paying for two rooms (as there was only one complimentary paper per Priority Club Member!). This, however, was quickly sorted out once we found someone who was capable of making a decision. The positive? Once we found someone in authority to help us with the room change, she was apologetic and effective; The breakfast staff were excellent; The rooms are clean and well serviced. Finally, the location, right next to Camden lock market was perfect for us. The market is great, it's a couple of minutes walk from Camden Town station and we never felt unsafe or uncomfortable at any point.  Sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives so I can't rate this better than 2 out of five."
102,827,"Feb 1 2007 	Excellent hotel	Despite paying a rock-bottom price (through Travel Supermarket.com), we were given a great room overlooking the canal. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, and could not fault it. Clean and comfortable throughout, excellent continental breakfast, and exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Recommended."
103,827,"Jan 30 2007 	Our weekend	We visited this hotel on the 25th of January for a long weekend. The hotel was very welcoming and spotless. The surrounding area is full of culture, music and most importantly food. There is a lovely chinese restaurant opposite the hotel (wagamama chain) and a largish wetherspoons pub next door.There is some noise (music) from around the hotel but it doesn't go on very late.Exceptional hotel."
104,827,Jan 13 2007 	Great Hotel	Stayed here for a business trip. Hotel is very well equipped for the business traveller and would recommend it also for tourists.Rooms very comfortable if a little warm. Very soft beds and well equipped rooms.
105,827,"Jan 4 2007 	Awesome times.	Great hotel, really friendly staff. Everything was to the highest standards. We had a great visit, this was our first time in London and camden was a real experience it's got something for everyone. We're definitely coming back. A real highlight for us and a plus for anyone staying here is the fifty five bar straight across the street. The guys in there are awesome and really made us feel welcome. If you want a great trip pop into central london in the morning, then explore the markets in the afternoon. At night just kick back and relax in fifty five so you just have to stumble back across to your room."
106,827,Nov 29 2006 	Camden Town Lock	New hotel right on the Regents Canal at Camden Lock. Room was small but new and well integrated furniture made it compact but not cramped. Bathroom was well appointed but cramped. Bed was on the soft and springy side. Lobby included a pleasant bar (espresso and liquor). Staff was friendly. A non-functioning TV remote was quickly fixed. Booked through Priceline and received a smoking room but it proved to be without odors. Also upon checkin we were informed our Priceline price didn't include breakfast; the buffet breakfast an extra 12 pounds. Needless to say we ate out. Camden Town Road and the various markets provide some interest in direct proportion to how many tattoos and body piercings you have but much of Camden Town Road is just seedy. A 10 minute walk to the Camden Town tube station and six stops to Leicester Square but even this short a trip can be trying on the crowded and dirty London underground.
107,827,"Nov 28 2006 	Good Hotel bad area	I stayed four nights in this Holiday Inn with my wife on a recent trip to London, the room was clean &amp; very quite. The hotel is good, the area is well just bad.This hotel is located in an area that historically is not the best. It is getting better but there is way too much open drug dealing in the surrounding streets for any normal person to feel very safe. The police seem not to care &amp; do nothing to stop this very illegal activity. It will hurt local business including this hotel if this keeps happening.The Camden Market is very busy on weekends &amp; most nights. Some nice restaurants &amp; bars including a Weatherspoon (almost next door).I honestly cant recommend this hotel unless something is done to clean-up the illegal &amp; very open activity that occurs right outside the hotel."
108,827,"Nov 17 2006 	Comfortable Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for one week in October for a mix of business and pleasure. As other reviewers have indicated it is a comfortable, modern, roomy (by London standards) hotel. Camden itself is a cosmopolitan area well serviced by the tube and buses. There are several restaurants within a block or two of the hotel with a variety of cuisines. Older and single travellers may find the walk from the tube station a little uneasy after dark. Our room didn't face the outside of the building and we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. Would happily stay again on future visits to London."
109,827,"Nov 12 2006 	Good but noisy location	This hotel has a good location at Camden Lock, a lively area with plenty of nightlife including a large Wetherspoons right next door. The nearest tube station is a short walk away. The hotel itself is modern, comfortable and well-maintained, with smart rooms (particularly the bathrooms). The only downside is that it's a bit noisy; the windows keep out some, but not all, of the noise from the people on the streets below, and I also found I could hear the people in the room next door. Other than that this hotel's great, but if you want peace and quiet look somewhere else."
110,827,"Oct 25 2006 	great hotel	We stayed at holliday inn camden lock for 3 nights.The room was very spacious compared to average british hotel standards. Nice clean bathroom with a tub.The surronding area goes from beautiful to wouldnt go there alone a dark night.Between the hotel and the tube station there are alot of gothand punk type of shops with the accompanying sort of people, and if youre not used to this type of crowd that might make you feel uncomfortable. But I never once felt unsafe in the area.The breakfast buffet was great it had a large selection of everything from toast to hot food.would absolutlety stay there again"
111,827,"Oct 4 2006 	One of London's better hotels........breakfast ok	Stayed at the hotel, on business during September 2006.The hotel is only 5 mins from Camden Tube station which makes it easy to commute into the city for business or a night on the town (10 taxi from Leicester Square).At the rear of the hotel there are several shops and bars around the canal / locks. These are nice area for a relaxing afternoon, away from the hussle and bustle on Camden High Street.I have stayed in numerous London hotels, however this was my first visit to this particular hotel. I was very happy with the location &amp; size of rooms, therefore I will definately return on business. I would also recommend this hotel as good destination for a weekend break.Breakfast was ok, however it wasn't excellent !"
112,827,"Sep 23 2006 	Good hotel	I stay here regularly on business.The hotel is relatively new and purpose built. As such, the rooms are a good size, standard Holiday Inn, rather than converted from previous use. The staff are friendly and room service is reasonably priced. There are a number of restaurants nearby. Camden is out of the central zone to the North. The tube station is 5 mins walk from the hotel and there is a bus service. Camden has long been a &quot;bohemian&quot; area in london and the main street has a famous clothing market. It does have a drugs scene and is not appropriate for youger children after dark, although the hotel is set on a side street where it isn't so visible. Efforts to clean up the area continue."
113,827,"Sep 6 2006 	Excellent hotel!!	I stayed here with my mum over the August bank holiday weekend and had a great stay. Our room was large and clean and the bed was so comfy! The bathroom too more than lived up to expectations with both a bath and a great shower. In addition, we had a balcony which was completely unexpected and gave us a great view over the Lock.The bar downstairs was a great place to relax and the staff were really friendly - asking how we were, giving advice as to where to go out to etc. We also got a free newspaper and breakfast was included - although we only had this on one morning, when checking out they refunded us for the breakfasts we hadn't had, which I thought was a nice touch.The area itself is great - there's a great choice of restaurants and bars with a Weatherspoons 10 seconds walk from the lobby, and a Wagamamas right opposite, which served us well on our first night.The only complaint we had during the stay was the room next door which decided to have a party on the Saturday night at 3.00am. However, we phoned downstairs, got an apology and within the next 10 minutes it was all quiet again. In addition, the next morning we got a small box with two free chocolates inside - very nice touch!I would definately stay here again - its close to the tube and the nightlife - all in all a great hotel."
114,827,"Jun 4 2006 	Excellent hotel highly recommended	You know, if you were to hunt back over my previous reviews in TripAdvisor, you'd find that I'm starting to sound like an old grumpy man.Pretty much every review begins with my description of my shoulders slumping and the depressed sigh as soon as I've entered most of the 100-a-night London hotels (excluding breakfast, of course). The feeling of &quot;Is that IT ?!&quot; as soon as you walk in most London hotel rooms is enough to put me off returning to the capital.It's a relief to finally be able to praise a London hotel.The Holiday Inn Camden Town is a stunner. I've stayed here for three weeks (not at weekends), and it just manages to tick all the good boxes. The hotel feels modern, the rooms are spaceous (gasp!), and have lots of mod cons. The curtains are blackout curtains - you can actually sleep beyond sunrise if you want to. The room temperature works well, and is controlled by ONE dial for heating and air conditioning - genius! - I wish all hotel rooms had this. And the lighting in the rooms is very hip and modern. Would sir like background lighting, spotlights, or a subtle lamp ?The bed is really comfy (better than mine at home, damn it!) and the staff are genuinely helpful and friendly. During the first week, I stayed in a room with two double beds (83 per night, inc breakfast), but for the next two weeks, I went for a room with one double bed and desk with leather chair. This is much better for working.Oh, and for once, the hotel *is* close to a tube station, just a 5 minute walk from the Camden Town tube. Commuting into the financial district used to take 25 minutes at rush hour.The restaurant food is good, but it always seems a little empty in there, and there's a Weatherspoons pub next door (if you fancy something cheaper) and loads of really good restaurants between the hotel and tube station. The downside to the hotel: well, the area outside can feel dodgy at times. It is right next to Camden Lock, with the market area right next to you, but you really can't walk far around here without being offered drugs.The soundproofing within the hotel isn't too good (but was mostly peaceful). But my biggest bugbear was with the internet connection. Yes, the rooms have wireless, but 8 pounds for 4 hours use is a ridiculous price to charge.The room charges on the Holiday Inn website seem to vary a lot. Two weeks ago, I was paying 110 per night, then 83 the following two weeks... so shop around.Oh, and at 4 pounds per (small) glass, you would kinda hope that the hotel bar's range of white wines would stretch beyond their one single Chardonnay on offer.All-in-all, this isn't just a good hotel, this is the BEST hotel I've stayed at in London, and the only one I actually enjoy staying at. Highly recommended."
115,827,"May 29 2006	positively surprised	knowing some hotels in london we did not expect too much. But we were positively surprised. The rooms are spacious (for London standards), bathroom clean, everything fine. We did not have breakfast, so I dont know anything about it.The Hotel is located in the middle of Camden, just around the corner are all the little shops of Camden Lock, pubs and restaurants are just a block away (one is opposite the hotel).Short walk (about 5 minutes to the next underground station (Camden Town), Leicester Square Area within 15 minutes by tube. Enjoyed it very much, will stay there probably again next time in London."
116,827,"May 25 2006	Nice Hotel Eclectic Location	The hotel is located right off the main thoroughfare, backing onto the canal. The hotel is very clean, quite modern and the staff are friendly. Our room itself was on the smallish side, but it had nice full size window/door that fully opened. Our room had one queen size bed, but we saw inside other rooms that had two queen size beds. All the amenities were there (ironing board, dryer, TV with a few channels and some crappy old movies on Pay-per-view, coffee machine, cream soap dispenser next to bathroom sink, body gel/soap dispenser in shower). Also, these thin towels that were amazingly absorbent; weird I know, but its one of the things I remember about the room! The place is also in a great location. Camden Town is an eclectic area with lots of small shops, pubs, clubs, restaurants, food stalls. I would say this area is &quot;edgier&quot; than other parts of London we visited with a more punk-ish/alternative style, which was perfect for us. We never felt anything negative in our many forays around Camden Town, including many a late-night walk back to the hotel. Yes, we were offered drugs a few times on the nearby streets, but we are young-ish and dressed in such a way that we presumably fit the demographics though we never felt threatened. And no, we never partook. The hotel is also very close to Camden Town station on the tube which is on the Northern Line. Very easy to get to and from other places in London. For those who know such things, the hotel is just inside Zone 2 for the tube. So for an all day tube pass from the hotel to Zones 2 and 1 (where mostly all the tourist attractions are) is 4.90 (this pass is good on the buses to).One thing to avoid about the hotel is paying the 2.50 for 15 minutes internet charge in their mini business centre. Just go up to Camden Road where there are many internet cafes. These are not easily noticable though. There is one, for example, at the back of Noodle Hut food vendor. Just look for (often handwritten) signs at the entrance to the cheap food vendors. These are often 1 for 2 hours, quite a difference over the Holiday Inn's prices! The hotel does offer in-room wireless internet access, but I have no idea of the charges, if any.Also, Priority Card members get a free newspaper (of your choice) delivered early morning under your door.There is a breakfast buffet which was very good, if a bit pricy. Typical British fry-up fare available (eggs, beans, cumberland sausage, blood sausage, veggies, hash browns) along with more traditional fare (cereals, juices, croissants, cheeses, breads, etc..). Be careful though, this buffet is sometimes included in your hotel charge, but it may not be. We had two different reservations (don't ask) one with the breakfast buffet, one without. The buffet was very good, but see how much it knocks off the price of your hotel room before you decide if its worth it or not. If you don't have the breakfast buffet included, I recommend you go up to the main street (Camden) and just walk. You'll hit a number of small cafs or diners.Couple of decent pubs just up the street, Oxford Arms and Elephant's Head. Standard pubs, but very convenient locations relative to the hotel. Literally a minute away.Despite my minor internet quibble, bottom line, I would recommend this hotel to friends."
117,827,"May 17 2006	Would definately be back	My wife and I stayed here on the Thursday and Friday, May 11 and 12. We had read the reviews and prepared ourselves for quite a threatening area but had no need to worry. Although it is wise to be cautious in any location, the Thursday and Friday late nights were fine and there was a good mix of people on the streets. We were given a room (417) overlooking the lock which we loved as it had two glass door which opened fully to allow us to sit and relax with the view down below.During the day, the markets were very interesting with a wide variety of items for sale. The lock area is excellent and it is very relaxing to spend time around the market buildings, in the outside food areas or indoor cafe.The hotel is modern, clean with staff who were very helpful. The reception manager, Federica, took time to find our Priority Club membership so we could have a late check out and a couple of free bottles of water. It felt as if nothing was too much trouble and we felt very welcome.We will definately be back for the above reasons, but also because it was quick to get to and from the city centre with only a short walk to the underground."
118,827,"May 12 2006	Good Value	Stayed at the Camden In over the weekend of 5,6,7 May 06. The hotel is very new and is right on the canal beside Camden Lock. The hotel staff were friendly and the facilities modern and very new. The room was clean and spacious and offered a room safe, trouser press, ironing board, coffee facilities and pay per view movies. The hotel is very close to several trendy pubs right on the canal.The area of Camden around the hotel is very 'Bohemian' but there is rougher edge to it, and I would not recommend it after dark to families are single travelers unless your are very confident in yourself. I did not see any trouble but witnessed plenty of police cars speeding up the road with blues and twos on and was offered drugs several times whilst waking down the street! (I declined!).Overall the hotel is good the area is funky but a bit risque, and if you can cope with that then go for it!"
119,827,"May 2 2006	Nice Hotel Ignore first impression of area	Nice hotel, if a bit apprehensive when we got off the tube as to what type of area we were in. HOWEVER, I felt totally fine walking through the Market and Lock and Saturday by myself. Take my advice wander round the markets, get some food for one of the stalls and watch the canal boats pass by, you wouldn't think you where in the middle of a city.Hotel itself was fine, nice rooms, even provided me with a toothbrush when I realised I had forgotten mine. Would definately stay again."
120,827,"Apr 23 2006	Excellent - no problems what so ever	Ive stayed in this hotel twice before. It is a fairly modern hotel and the service here is excellent. The executive room is nice and spacious, with bath &amp; shower, king size bed and a balcony over looking the canal. Room service was on time, reasonably priced and of good quality. Some people say that Camden is 'strange' or 'dangerous'. Camden is unique in its own sense, but its fairly safe. If anything, go to the hotel via the main road and not through passed starbucks, weatherspoons and the bridge."
121,827,"Apr 7 2006 	Rotten area.	I stayed here for one night as a retired female travelling alone. It was a mistake. I booked this hotel because I wanted a room with a proper bathroom and air conditioning near to Euston. The bathroom was absolutely lovely and immaculately clean, nice bath, fabulous power shower and good quality fittings but tiny towels. The bed was very comfortable and decent linen. So what was wrong? The room had one small window which barely opened and I had no view, literally a brick wall high enough to block out the sky. This was a real shock. The room was oppressively stuffy and the air conditioning was totally inadequate. I found it to be like a prison cell and couldn't wait to leave the next morning. Worst of all was the area. The hotel is in a side street off the main shopping area right by Camden Lock. It should have been great but the streets were teeming with people who were unfriendly/aggressive and too rough for my liking. I felt at a real disadvantage being on my own and would not have felt safe after dusk. I have to say it would be a brilliant hotel for a group of young people going to a rock concert. Not for me. I am getting old and hard to please maybe but for 95 I might have fared better somewhere further away from Euston station.The staff were pleasant and friendly which was nice but if you are going it alone I would avoid this place and get a recommendation from someone who is more experienced at booking suitable London hotels."
122,827,"Apr 4 2006	Best Location / Best Price / Best Everything....	Such a high standard hotel for such a low fare! And all this in the middle of London, in Camden Town, where it all happens! Clean, high standard rooms ( designer-like ), excellent breakfast, friendly staff, unbeatable location.Don't worry about reviews that say &quot;strange neighbourhood&quot; or so. Camden Town is not dangerous anymore! Quite the contrary - camden town today is one of Londons' hippest neighborhood with the best stores, food and markets. Check it out - you won't be disappointed!"
123,827,"Apr 2 2006 	Nice! Good location. Comfortable hotel.	I stayed here just for one night but there really was nothing to fault other than the breakfast, which there wasn't enough hot vegetarian foods. But other than that it was great.Good location, I went with my work place who were organising a team building event. The location was great, 5 minutes from the nearest tube station. Interesting people in the area! The hotel room was superb, nothing wrong with it at all, it was very comfortable and spacious. See pictures. Staff from my experience were all fine too. Would reccommend it to most."
124,827,"Feb 6 2006	Fantastic	This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, we had room 220 overlooking the lock and the market, and it was surprisingly quiet at night - no problems with getting to sleep. The breakfast at this hotel was the best I have ever had, fantastic buffet with just about everything you can think of on it! We paid only 70 for a queen sized room including breakfast by booking direct on the Holiday Inn website - such fab value for money!"
125,827,"Jan 23 2006	Great Hotel - Veeerrry Interesting town - and people!!	After reading some reviews we spent only 1 night at Holiday Inn Camden Lock, to our great disappointment. Originally booked for 2 nights then changed to another hotel for the 2nd night - big mistake!! The Hotel was very modern, clean , bright and comfortable. The room was very comfortable and spacious, with two big double beds, excellent air conditioning system. The mini bar was quite pricey, though we didn't use it as we took our own minitures! Staff were very kind and helpful with any queries we had. Breakfast was included (good deal from Holiday Inn website 85,) and was very good, with a good selection, clean lovely bright dining room, but on reflection we wish we hadn't eaten, as there was so much variety on offer at the market just outside the hotel. The hotel itself is in an excellent location, right on the lock (we are big fans of canals and barges! - no we are not THAT old!) Only downside - no car park facility - nearest one is Pratt Street, but very reasonable at 12.50 per 24hrs, 10 weekends, but hey - this IS London. We got on the 88 bus to Trafalgar Square, and realised it wasnt too far away for all the regular tourist attractions, and for only 1.50 single, but a day ticket is very good value too.To say the Camden markets and the people were interesting is an understatement. We picked up some great bargains, lots of original itmes, and had a real laugh with some of the characters on the stalls. We also met up with the resident town crier around the Lock market, who was a bundle of fun too!!There is a pub on almost every street corner, and plenty of good bars and restaurants. Try the Tapas bar round the corner on Inverness street 'Barganza' for great tasting, great value food, and plenty of it.Yes, there were some dodgy looking characters at night, (same as most towns) but we didn't feel threatened or vulnerable in anyway, just smiled politely and went on our way, and they did the same.The high street and the markets are just so full of life and vibrancy, friendly people, Punks, Goths, Mocha's galore, but all the more interesting for that, it was hard to leave. We will definitely be back, with our 2 teenage kids, and sooner rather than later!"
126,827,"Jan 23 2006	Fantastic Hotel Will Use Again and Again	I brought my boyfriend a weekend stay in Camden for his Christmas present as he hadn't been to London before. I didn't know what to expect with the hotel as i have never stayed here however this hotel was one of the parts that made our weekend perfect. We turned up 2.5 hours earlier than the arrival time and they let us have our room straight away, the hotel was extremely easy to find and i would say you couldn't find a hotel in such a perfect location for Camden. Its very clean and the staff are always there to help. Our room was an exectutive room and i would say they are well worth the money the views along the locks are great, You don't get any problems with the noise coming from the markets and the bars either. Our train wasn't until the night time and the hotel porter came an collected our luggage and put them in a safe room for us to come back and collect later. The only problem we encountered was that we wasn't staying long enough and we didn't want to leave...."
127,827,"Jan 19 2006	Good value	Great location for the price if you don't mind not being slap bang in the centre of town which is only a very short tube or cab ride away. Tube station is a one block away and there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within a few blocks. Our room was spacious, modern and very clean. Front desk staff are friendly but slow and somewhat bewildered."
128,827,"Oct 24 2005	A real find in London	Myself and partner were attending a concert in the Jazz Cafe so we found this hotel to be quite near the venue.Camden is a funky, trendy, hip and happening part of London which means there are plenty of bars and clubs nearby and a few 'characters' out and about which, in my view, adds to the ambiance!The Holiday Inn Camden Lock is right on the canal edge beside the famous Camden Lock footbridge and the many markets and shops. The bar next door to the hotel doesn't allow outside drinking after 9:30pm so noise shouldn't really be a problem.We did hear some revellers late on but nothing too bad.I found the check-in to be swift and courteous, our room and bathroom was immaculate and functional. A nice juliet style balcony enables you to open glass doors onto the canal side. The bar area is friendly and not too expensive with a plasma TV and internet room off to the side.The hotel is about a 10 minute stroll from Camden Town tube station and is therefore very easy to find.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future. In fact the location is great for seeing some of the real London yet only a 10min tube ride from the tourist sites and much more expensive bars/resteraunts in the West end.Well recommended!"
129,827,"Sep 13 2005	Good hotel interesting neighborhood	I stayed in this hotel for 6 days in August. It's located in Camden Town, in northern London. The tube station is right around the corner on the Northern Line, so it's easily accessible. When we got out of the station to walk to the hotel, we were amused by the crowded, punk neighborhood. It's like St. Mark's Place in Manhattan, only more. The hotel itself is quite comfortable: the room was a fine size, clean and cozy. I slept well each night, but as a New Yorker, it might have been noisy at night but I wouldn't know. For some reason there are only about 4 tv channels, and lots of pay channels. So don't go for the television viewing. They had a large breakfast buffet of average quality (which was devoured for an hour every morning by my German travelling companions) with good service. We had dinner in the area one night, and realized that everyone in the restaurant was younger and louder than we were. Didn't go back, opting instead for travelling on the tube to more central neighborhoods in search of quieter dining. All in all, I think it was a good value, you just have to decide if you mind the young, loud area. The hotel is perfectly comfortable."
130,827,"Sep 4 2005	OK Hotel Dodgy Area	Stayed here for a Saturday night whilst in London. Hotel was OK, but nothing special.However, would agree with other reviews that the area seems a bit dodgy. Walked down Camden High Street about 8pm and there seemed to be quite a few dodgy looking characters hanging around (drugs dealers ?) which made us feel a bit apprehensive. Bizarrely, when we walked back around midnight, they'd all disappeared and it seemed a lot safer.All in all, would only stay here again if I needed to be in Camden."
131,827,Jul 31 2005 	Nice hotel Not so nice neighbourhoud	In the month april I have stayed in the Holiday Inn Camden Lock. The room is clean and it's size was comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The only major drawback is the location of the hotel. The hotel is located in the Camden Lock area. During the night you can feel quite uncomfortable when walking on the streets in this area. So i wouldn't recommend this hotel to parents with kids. But if you aren't scared easily and likes to stay in an alternative neighbourhood this hotel offers a good value for you money ( Paid around 85 a night)
132,827,"Jul 23 2005	Great Hotel / Bad Area	I stayed in the holiday-inn camden town just a week ago. Im a teenager on a trip with my family and we all thought the hotel was good but the area was, Interesting to say the least. When we heard camden lock market we thought farmers market, we were wrong to say the least its a goth, punk area not the cleanist and nicest area. If your traveling with kids i would not recomend the hotel also beware at night i felt a bit scared at night outside, But it was a nice hotel convienent to the tube station and on a good line so very convienent.So if you dont mind the area its a great hotel."
133,827,"Jun 20 2005	Quite nice but noisy.	Seems like a newish hotel, but is already showing a bit of wear and tear in places (hole in duvet cover and damaged lift). Whilst the room I had was a good size and the bed was very comfortable, some of the fixtures and fittings seemed a bit flimsy and done 'on the cheap'.Worst thing was the noise. As it's on Camden Lock you get a lot of noise from bars (espeically in summer - beer gardens!). This isn't so bad as it pretty much stops come 11pm - midnight. However, I was there for four nights and was woken every night by other guests returning from nights out - times ranged between 2am and 5am. The hotel management seem to be aware of this as every night there was a note on the TV for all guests, asking to show a bit of consideration for other guests if returning late. Sadly the people on my floor didn't take this request on-board.Not the hotels fault really, but I won't be staying there again."
134,827,May 31 2005	High quality very clean and comfortable	We stay at the Camden Lock Holiday Inn quite regularly for business in London and it is an extremely clean and comfortable hotel with excellent staff.The breakfast is somewhat dissapointing - it is a full English buffet but the standard is pretty poor and yet expensive so we do not eat breakfast here. However you are in the heart of Camden so there are plenty of nearby places to eat.This hotel is not cheap and you have to book early to get the best rate of around 85 a night. However the standard of the hotel is excellent and the staff and services are of very high quality. Finding a good hotel in London is very very difficult and that is why we always return to Camden Lock Holiday Inn whenever we can. If you can get a good rate book without hesitation!
135,827,"Apr 19 2005	Loved it.	I have to say. I have just found this site and wish I'd found it before our London trip.We arrived in London to a nightmare of a hotel situation. Our first hotel booked through hotels.ca was terrible. The first room was in the basement with a view of garbage through the tiny windows near the ceiling. The front desk was lovely though and after requesting a room change were ushered through tiny stairwells to another room. Not fantastic but acceptable given what we were paying. Then I tried to shower. There was no water. Again the staff was lovely and ushered me to a staff &quot;room&quot; to shower, while the plumber attempted to resolve our water issues. My eight year old son was endearing himself to the handyman with offers of assistance while my husband tried to catch a quick nap. I got wet in the shower and the water disappeared.At this point the boys were being entertained by the staff in the lobby and my husband and I went down to meet them. The staff really was terrific by the way and very embarrassed. We let them know we were going to head out for the day and give them time to resolve their issues. After an exhausting day and suffering from jet lag I was desperate for a bed and heading back to the hotel in fear to be honest. We were met my the manager who was a delight and he had a car waiting to take us to Holiday Inn. We stayed for three nights free of charge!WHAT a delightful suprise for us. They felt terribly that our first family vacation had started like this.The staff at Holiday Inn were fabulous. Extremely helpful, and given we were freebees I was certainly not expecting the above and beyond treatment we received. Lorenzo was especially wonderful and allowed us to bring pots of tea and coffee from the kitchen to our room.The hotel was exceptionally clean, and modern. The breakfast was more than ample to fill our bellies and again...the staff allowed us to take some extra bagels and fruit for our daily adventures with the children. My son is a fan of Lorenzo's forever for introducing him and supplying him with monstrous amounts of nutella.The staff made a weary, disappointed family very very happy.Now...the hotel is a little out of the way but nothing a short tube ride didn't take care of. The neighbourhood was rather creepy after dark and I learned what &quot;skunk&quot; was as did my son as we looked for something to eat.It had a great little chinese food place around the corner though with an internet cafe which was helpful to let our family know we had relocated.I would most definately stay there again. I can not say enough about how fabulous the staff was."
136,827,"Apr 11 2005	Very comfortable and convenient	We needed a place to stay that would accommodate three people and would be in close proximity to University College London dorms in Camden Town where our older son was staying during his &quot;study abroad term&quot;. Finding a room that has two double beds in London is not an easy thing. This Holiday Inn was perfect. Very new and in great shape. Room was bigger than expected and much nicer than Holiday Inns we had stayed in in the USA. Very nice bathroom. Everything kept very clean and well maintained. Hotel staff was helpful and you are only a 5 minute walk from the tube stop. We ate at Weatherspoon's behind the hotel overlooking the Locks for a quick breakfast and dinner. Price was reasonable (for London) and the food was good. Camden Town is a trip. A cross between Seaside Hghts NJ, Fisherman's Wharf and Greenwich Village. You see everything imaginable. Finally the Holiday Inn site offered very good rates (again for London). Definitely would stay there again."
137,827,"Mar 28 2005	Peacefully Vibrant - A+++	Just back from a fab 2 night stay at the Holiday Inn - Camden Lock. It's located just a 2 minute walk up Camden High Street (manic on a weekend) from the Tube, close enough to all the action, but peacefully located next to the canal. We arrived early, at 11.00am, but we were greeted with a smile, a free upgrade to a wonderful penthouse studio with a great terrace overlooking the canal &amp; markets, and were told we had a late 2pm check-out if required! (I'll be joining more frequent traveller/flyer clubs!!). The rooms were all very modern (opened 2003), trendy and clean. Breakfast was included in our rate of 85GPB so all in all, a mighty fine deal. I'd recommend the pub/bar 'Lush' just across the road for a relaxed atmosphire and cocktail happy hour from 5 'till 7. Camden station is within zone 2 on the tube, so get a zones 1 &amp; 2 travelcard for the underground and buses (4.70 per day) and go enjoy... #1 Best London Tip: Jump on the No. 11 bus in Sloane Square (after munching Krispy Kremes at Harrods) and sit back to enjoy a bus tour of the sights (Downing Street, Buck Palace, Houses of Parliament, St Pauls, The City. Using your tube ticket buses run every 10 minutes, so it's just like the numerous 'Hop on-Hop off' rip-off tours, except it leaves 18GBP in your pocket!"
138,827,"Mar 8 2005	Really Cool Hotel	I stayed here for 7 nights and I enjoyed the hotel and area. Although Camden is busy with the markets etc, the hotel is off the main road and next to the lock, overlooking the markets. It's a good hotel as far as location goes, close to everything! The area around is lively - lots to eat, drink, shop, markets, movies, pubs etc... I must admit there are some creepy people in the evening, but that is a problem EVERYWHERE... the oddballs. As for the room - I had an excutive room on the very top floor with a massive patio. Room was always cleaned and the bath is well stocked and shower is really good. The hotel bar is good too. I did not eat at the hotel at all, the markets next door have great food stalls[CHEAP] and there is a Starbucks about 30 seconds away from the hotel. There is a restaurant call Wagamama, great japanese food. Avoid Arizona Restuarant - bland and small portions of food. Also, yes, there is a 'rock' crowd sometimes, but hardly anyone famous - just local bands/individuals looking to make it big. I would definitely go back to this hotel. [BOOK IN ADVANCE]"
139,827,"Feb 20 2005	Convenient for West End and City but cheaper	Stayed here in the half term holiday, when all the hotels in and around the West End where either full or stupidly expensive. Booked through Holiday Inn website and got a good rate (80) which included Buffet breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children. Room was very clean and well appointed. View from room was non existant, overlooking a flat roof and a brick wall, if you are staying for longer insist on a room higher than 1st floor!! Hotel is modern and pretty lacking in character but great for exploring Camden Town and Lock markets which cater mainly for Hippy, Goth and young trendies but are different and fun to look around. Take a morning stroll along the towpath, just outside the hotel, to Regents Park, Primrose Hill and Little Venice a nice change from the usual tourist haunts. Hotel is close to Camden Town tube for trains into the Centre of town and is down a side street off the High Street, although well lit I felt a bit vulnerable at night, as with any big City be aware !! Would recommend this hotel as a good alternative to West End hotels. Camden is different with some interesting and unusual places to eat and drink, but close enough to the City and West End."

2,828,"This hotel was brilliant and was ideal for our theatre break	Myself and a friend stayed here for a theatre break. Hotel clean, staff helpful, rooms comfortable, breakfast superb. Couldn't fault a thing. Great location for tube and we crammed in a fair amount of sightseeing in a short time. The london aquarium, The natural history museum and harrods to name just a few was only either a short walk or tube ride away. There is a nice pattiserie a couple of minutes away and a tesco's express too. The tube is less than a minute away .It was so good that we are staying again in early 2010 for a couple of nights on another theatre break.I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
3,828,"All you can expecto from a Holiday Inn	We arrived at 23,30 hours and they could not recommend a restaurant so we decided to go to Tesco, with very limited choices but when you are hingry you do not careNext day they rang the bell at 8,00 hours to clean the room, not being very nice being waken up so earlyEvery day they gave us a candy bar and two bottlets of water whic is a very nice touch.All in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location ( close to chelsea, 45 minutes walking from Picadilly ), I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price..."
4,828,"Great Price Terrific Location	I stayed at the Kensington Forum in October, while visiting London with my mother. We had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy, considering the small hotel rooms I have in previous trips to London.The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate. There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly-friendly hotel. (We were not expecting this at the Holiday Inn.)The location is absolutely wonderful. There are a number of coffee shops and small restaurants nearby, as well as a grocery store in the mall next to the hotel. We picked up apples and other fruit, then added those to the coffee and muffin/pastry at the cafes. The subway is within one block of the hotel, so you couldn't ask for it to be more convenient. As well, we had good weather, so we walked just about everywhere (probably averaging 10 kms a day). It's a nice neighbourhood with no safety concerns.Our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location. We absolutely found it at the Kensington Forum and I would not hesitate to stay there again. . .or to recommend it to a friend."
5,828,"Nov 20 2009 	Very Good Value - Excellent Location	We stayed 2 nights and have no complaints. We arrived about 11 am, room was ready. Lobby is large, lots of seating available. Desk staff was friendly and helpful. Room was good size for Europe - clean throughout. Bed very comfortable. The Concierge desk called our room to ask if we needed any information or assistance. The location is ideal for travel all over the city via the Underground. The Gloucester station is practically next door. There is an elevator on the Piccadilly line (from/to Heathrow) - but for only one level. You have to walk one flight of stairs with luggage. But the convenience of 3 major Underground lines at this station is terrific. Lots of small cafes, restaurants, pubs within a block or two. Would definitely stay here again."
6,828,"Nov 16 2009 	Excellent hotel in prime location	Just stayed here for a birthday weekend, what can i say, 2 minute walk from Gloster RD tube station, only 10 minute walk from museums. Lobby is large and tidy, we asked for a room with a city view and got one on tenth floor with no messing about. Room was plenty big enough and clean and tidy, bed was comfordable. Staff were freindly and helpfull, the breakfast was top draw, virtualy everything you can think off and plenty off it. I was stuffed until 4.30 in the afternoon ! All for the bargain price off  250 for 2 nights including return rail to North Wales."
7,828,"Nov 16 2009 	Good Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures	My husband and I stayed here for our 1 year anniversary trip October 29th- November 1st.First and foremost, the good, yes it has good location, a block away from Gloucester Road Tube Station. Also, the concierge was very helpful. Now for the bad...First, we walked in and the restroom door was broken. Then, they took our towels and didn't bother bringing us any back by the end of the night, I called to get towels and I waited 45 minutes, walked downstairs to argue with them and had to wait another 20 minutes. Also, we went to lay down, and guess what, the sheets had RED hair on them. I'm a brunette and so is my husband. I walked down there yet again to argue with them and let them know, they said that YOU HAVE TO LEAVE A NOTE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CHANGE THE SHEETS, BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGE THEM ONCE A WEEK!.. how disgusting!...so make sure you leave a note, because if not you'll be laying in week old sheets."
8,828,Nov 9 2009 	Great location	Love Holiday Inn and used our Priority Points for a one night stay here. Previously stayed over the road which is now a Crown Plaza but wouldn't hesitate to come back here. Huge Hotel but very friendly staff. Our room was typical holiday inn the bathroom could have done with updating but was spotless. Just around the corner from Gloucester Rd tube and plenty of pubs restaurants nearby. We had breakfast at the hotel which was good and no waiting or queueing. Would def stay again.
9,828,"Nov 5 2009 	Improved Experience - Would Happily Stay Again	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum last Christmas for an eight day vacation. During that time, we found the hotel to be satisfactory with the sole exception of the check-in process (detailed review from that stay is included on this site). However, our guest check-in experience was so bad last time that I did hesitate before booking again on this trip. The convenient location and competitive rates finally sold us on a repeat visit.When arriving for check in we were presented with similar problems from our last visit. (Our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc.) I gave a detailed account of our last experience to the desk clerk who immediately got the management involved to help us solve our problem. After about ten minutes, I was given two hotel rooms with little or no difficulty. My room (a single bed) was positively huge by European standards. The bed was perfectly comfortable, I had ample desk space for my work and my bathroom was much bigger than I expected. My friends were given a two bed room which was considerably smaller but, like mine, was clean and stocked with the necessities.If you're looking for a full-service experience, this is still not the hotel for you. Almost nothing is included in your stay (breakfast, phone use, internet, etc. all involve additional charges) but the rooms are clean and in relatively good condition (not flashy or stylish by any standards, however). If you want a safe, comfortable place to stay, I would certainly consider this hotel. After my poor check-in last time, I felt like the staff went out of their way to make sure I was happy on this stay. I also had the opportunity to check out the hotel gym on this trip which is roomy and very useful. Open 24 hours it's also convenient to your schedule.The location of this hotel is it's best feature - two blocks from the tube on lines that run to most major attractions. We also had no trouble catching cabs from the hotel entrance most nights, if necessary. Overall, a very good stay and I would be happy to recommend this hotel to others."
10,828,"Nov 3 2009 	Excellent Choice	My friend and I spent 2 nights at this hotel, and highly recommend it. Early check-in only allowed &quot;smoking&quot; room, but it was entirely acceptable, and only the hallway had faint smke odor. Rooms were relatively spacious (considering European properties), bathroom and amenities were outstanding. The window opened, so we were able to enjoy outside air, too. Mini fridge wasn't cooling properly, notified front desk, immediately remedied. This hotel is merely around the block/corner from Gloucester tube station, but the stairs might be a problem for some travelers. Waitrose (grocery) and lot of dining choices in immediate vicinity. You'll never regret this choice when in London!"
11,828,"Oct 26 2009 	DON'T TAKE THE CAT	The saving grace of this hotel, is the friendly staff and its location in Kensington.As noted in other reviews tube station is on the corner, and there are plenty of amenities close by.Explore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price.Rooms in the hotel are very small, as is the double bed. Hence the comment above leave the cat at home as there is no room to swing one.When the hotel is full as it was, last weekend the breakfast restaurant is not big enough to handle all the guests. So guests taking only the continental breakfast option are ushered into a make shift, restaurant in one of the conference rooms."
12,828,"Oct 26 2009 	Not up to par	Just got back from our trip and had to warn future travelers about this hotel. We booked a double through Travelocity paying in advance, which might of been the problem. We found the personnel less than accomodating and in some cases rude. The room was tired with peeling wallpaper although it was renovated recently. The room had a 13&quot; TV which had to be five years old at least. The water pressure in the shower/tub was not much more than a trickle and both tub and sink were slow to drain. The towels were of a quality that is more kin to lower priced/status hotels or motels. It is common across Europe to have small rooms and this was small for a double. Had we not paid in advance we would have looked for a better hotel, our complaints were never resolved satisfactorily. We saw many tour groups in the hotel from Japan, China and Europe who seemed to receive warmer receptions than we did. In short we were disappointed with the hotel.The positives were the location, a block from the Gloucster Rd. tube station and a Waitrose supermarket. Shopping was well within walking distance although the exchange rate was horrendous. We enjoyed our time visiting the sites but not going back to the hotel."
13,828,"Oct 26 2009 	Everything you need but probably not as much as you would like	Stayed for 2 nights in late October 2009. The hotel is enormous and, being part of a chain, you know exactly what to expect. The public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant'.Check-in was pain-free but limited - there was no mention of breakfast times, room departure times nor (most importantly) how to operate the lifts. This was with your room card ( and is a very good idea ) but some instruction would have been useful.The hotel was clean throughout, the breakfasts ( Continental and British) were good and wholesome.Overall, fair value for money - basically just what we expected. Is it fair to expect just a little bit more?"
14,828,"Oct 22 2009 	Comfortable beds and 1-minute walk to Tube	This hotel is only a 1-minute walk to the Gloucester (pronounced Glahster) Road Underground station (called the Tube). Even though the address states Cromwell Road, the hotel entrance is actually facing Courtfield Road. I went to the Holiday Inn around the corner on Cromwell Road and it was the wrong one. So, from Heathrow take the Tube to Gloucester Road, walk up the stairs, turn right at the ground level, turn right on Courtfield, walk 1 minute and the hotel is on the right.Walk out of the lobby of the hotel, turn left on Courtfield Road and you'll hit Gloucester Road about 1 minute later. There is a KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), Pret a Manger, and a Tesco Express right there on Gloucester Road. There are also a few pubs and some nicer restaurants but they're expensive, at least for Americans. The Tesco Express is good because you can grab ready-made sandwiches, chips (called crisps in the UK), pastries, cookies (called biscuits in the UK), etc, which is perfect for taking lunch or breakfast on the go. I went to Tesco in the morning to buy a croissant or pastry, then took it back to the room to eat it with freshly brewed tea. The rooms have an electric tea kettle and the tea and cream is provided."
15,828,"Oct 20 2009 	Its saving grace is its location	The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor.We use the Holiday Inn brand a lot and trust it. This is the first time we have stayed at the Kensington Forum and is probably the last, unless we get an incredibly good deal.We found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent. The hotel was very busy on the night we stayed and queues at the lifts were a little tiresome at times. The room was clean but tired as were the public areas that we saw. The bedroom, although recently upgraded with a new bed (very comfortable) had wall paper that was unstuck at the seams throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand - the TV was an outdated model. The room was quiet apart from the hum of the minibar. Breakfast felt hassled. The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets. The over zealous (but attentive under the circumstances) staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances. The location is excellent - near to the Tube and walking distance of a lot of attractions. I think we could do better next time however."
16,828,"Oct 15 2009 	Lucky Us!	Used Hotwire for the first time, requesting a 4-star hotel in the Kensington-Chelsea area. Turned out to be this excellent property in a prime location. Half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid, but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view. Location could not have been better with the Gloucester Road tube station just a few minutes' walk from the hotel. Piccadilly and Circle lines took us everywhere we wanted to go quickly and conveniently. Excellent grocery store on the corner made it easy to keep our in-room fridge stocked with breakfast items. Concierge desk staffed by knowledgeable and friendly gents whose recommendations were consistently excellent. Room was comfortable, very well lighted, and well maintained by housekeeping staff. Only negative was that the room, fitted with twin beds, was small even for just two adults. Also, I suggest taking your own wash cloths, as they were removed daily but not always replaced. Bottom line is that I would definitely return to this property for its comfort and convenient location."
17,828,"Oct 14 2009	Great Location clean good place to stay!	My sister and I recently stayed here in while spending a week in London. The hotel was conviently located. There is a tube stop within close walking distance. A grocery store and two pharmacies. There are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block. The hotel was clean and the room was a decent size. The concierge (Peter) was awesome! He was friendly, very helpful with reccomendations and directions. The front desk was less helpful and much less friendly. The housekeeping staff was very efficient and helpful. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends, and would probably stay here again, because it was such a great location and clean. It's a great place to stay if you need a clean, well located, safe place to stay but don't plan on spending too much time in the hotel."
18,828,"Oct 13 2009 	Rooms not big enough for a family of 3	Paid for an executive room and it was not big enough for a family of 3. Our daughter is not old enough to have an adjoining room. There was no room once sofa bed was down as we had to climb over it to get to toilet once our daughter was in bed. I'm glad the fire alarm didn't go off during the night or there was a power cut as no doubt one of us would've had an accident. The rooms are tiny. We did complain and staff told us this was there best room. You must be kidding.When checking out handed over a Scottish 20 note and FIL (Woman) gave a huge sigh, and it seemed a bother to her to accept this although she said nothing else."
19,828,"Oct 11 2009 	Girls Trip	The hotel was ideally located next to the tube which made it perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go. Great museums within walking distance. Room and bathroom was very clean. A little small by US standards but big enough for the two of us. My only complaint was the staff at the front desk. There was one lady who could not have been more rude or act more like she did not want to be bothered to have to do her job. There were others who were very friendly but then did not follow through with what they said they'd do. After many phone calls and visits to the front desk regarding not being able to connect with the internet I was finally told it was not working in our room and they knew that it wasn't when we checked in. We were even told we were upgraded because it was a special occassion trip. However, we had paid for the upgrade when we made the reservation.The conceirge was very good and knowledgable. Several places to eat close by. All in all our trip was wonderful. I mean, we were in London. If you're just looking for a place to sleep and that is ideally located to sightseeing then I would recommend this hotel."
20,828,"Oct 9 2009 	Great hotel great location	I read the reviews of this hotel and was a bit skeptical due to the fact that it caters to groups, but I really liked it. Even though it's a chain, the staff was very helpful and friendly. I didn't feel like I was just another number there. It does cater to groups, meaning airline pilots, flight attendants, and school groups. When I was there there was a large group of Japanese students staying there and sometimes they could get a little loud. And I could see how if a large group of pilots or something checked out all at once, that could be a problem if one was trying to check out at the same time. But I really liked the hotel - the rooms were decently sized, there was a nice bank of lifts in the lobby, and again, the staff was friendly, which goes a long way when you've just got off a ten hour flight. It's right around the corner from the Gloucester Road tube station, also, which is great."
21,828,"Oct 9 2009 	Our favorite affordable hotel in London	Have stayed several places in London - this was the most comfortable and served as the perfect spot for recovering after a full day of exploring the city. What's great? For starters, it's clean, relatively modern, and well-appointed. Our room was spacious by London standards and had all the amenities we needed. Even better is the hotel's location - literally a two-minute walk around the corner and you're at the Gloucester Road Tube Station and a host of small shops, pubs and eateries. Even better, you are within walking distance of a number of attractions including museums and shopping. Little touches such as complimentary candy bars and juice stocked in the room each day were a nice touch. We're London fans and intend to stay here again!"
22,828,"Oct 8 2009 	adequate	This hotel didn't wow me, but it wasn't the worst either. There were perks: right up the block from the tube, nice staff in the bar, comfortable rooms. However, there were downfalls: rude front desk staff.This hotel is a favorite among airline personnel and they were seemingly checking in at all hours however my group was not allowed to check in one moment too soon. Also, one of my colleagues wanted to leave his room key for his wife but the front desk staff wouldn't allow him to do so.You could do worse, but this hotel's proximity to the tube won me over."
23,828,"Oct 8 2009 	Absolutely wonderful experience!	My parents and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum earlier this year. It was our seventh visit to London but the first to stay in this area. We were pleasantly surprised at the hotel. For European standards, the rooms were big. There were clean and quiet. The breakfast was filling and pretty good, too. The hotel is within walking distance of the Tube which made our travels easier. It is also within walking distance of Harrod's and lots of restaurants. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn't eat there preferring to try our luck in more local eateries. The staff was very pleasant and helpful.We have always had nice stays in London, but we all felt that the Kensington Forum was head and shoulders above the others. I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to others."
24,828,"Oct 6 2009	OK but others nearby are better.	Large hotel, well placed. Our room was smaller than expected.The bathroom was tiny. The breakfast room got very busy at times. There were very long waiting times to use the lifts. Other nearby hotels had a nicer lounge area and better rooms."
25,828,"Sep 23 2009 	Never Again	I have booked hotels all over Europe and have never had such a poor experience....In fact, I have never written a complaint. My husband and I checked in and were given a regular room. We showed ourselves to the room and it smelled terribly musky. I went down to the front desk, stood in line half an hour, was interrogated by the clerk and finally given a similar room on a different floor which did not smell. It did have mold in the corner of the tub, but that was better than the malodor. I have experience with the small size of some European hotels, but this hotel room was the smallest I have encountered. You practically had to go sideways to get from the bed to the window area. The TV was circa 1995. Further, and most important, the room telephone did not work, If there had been an emergency, it could have been a very serious matter. I reported the phone when I checked out. Our stay was from Sept. 18th thru 19th and I was so glad we were just stuck there for one night. Never would I recommend this hotel. KHR, Tenafly, NJ"
26,828,"Sep 21 2009 	Great stay friendly service great location	My spouse and I and my son and his fiance booked two standard rooms for a 10-day stay. Before we arrived I e-mailed the hotel asking whether our rooms had in-room safes. A prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service, so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost. The rooms were ready at our mid-afternoon check-in. We had requested double or queen beds on a no-smoking floor and that's what we got. The staff in reception were very friendly, and helpful. The rooms are very clean and quiet. The housekeeping staff do a good job cleaning and re-stocking the room, and, like the rest of the staff, were very friendly. Our booking included just the continental breakfast, but the selection included cereals, fruits, yogurt, juices, meat, cheese, and breads and pastries. A full-English breakfast upgrade is available for small up-charge from our rate. For American travellers such as we, the rooms have a US-spec 110VAC outlet for use without an adapter or converter. The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable.All the staff we encountered were knowledgable and friendly, making us feel very welcome. The only negative was a call I made from the room to a friend's mobile phone -- 14.00 for 7 minutes.The neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from &quot;fast food&quot; to up-scale with a wide variety of cuisines -- we never had a bad meal. As others have noted, the Gloucester Road tube station is within a couple hundred meters serving the 3 key tube lines.We were very pleased with the hotel and its staff rating all categories at five ticks without hesitation."
27,828,"Sep 20 2009 	locationlocationlocation	We love the Gloucester Rd neighborhood but this was our first time staying at the HI Kensington Forum. It is a quick block from Gloucester Rd tube station Turn immediately right out of Tube and walk down first street where the Milleniums are-trying to enter on Cromwell rd is confusing). Tons of restaurants, Boots, Waitrose, Starbucks, a Tesco open 24hrs and Cafe Paul's with die-for pastry.The hotel looks much as it does in virtual tour. We had a double which I booked through HW at a fantastic rate. I was given a smoking room on request at check in. While several airlines use the hotel for staff and they also had cruise line groups and other conferences going on, hotel staff were never harried or too busy to help and they moved quickly and were pleasant. Check in was very quick and easy.The double room is small as in most of London and only one person can walk by the bed at a time. However, the layout does give storage space and there is a closet where we fit 3 bags completely. We were on the 23rd floor with a great views of Albert Hall and the Eye. Elevator was always prompt despite many guests. There were a few marks and rips on wallpaper etc but overall room was in good shape and both room and bath were clean. Great hot water with good pressure in shower. They were in the middle of re-branding during our 4 day stay which meant new signage and new pillows. The bed was firm and, as I have a bad back, i slept very well. Only one odd thing: You are given 2 bath towels for 2 people. Maybe I'm a towel hog, but i like one for my hair and one for overall drying. The next morning I asked the maid and received another towel. However, when another maid came to make up the room when we were out she took back the extra towel and also took my own personal facecloths that i travel with. So in this case, the hotel stole my towels lol! I would say this is a better than standard HI and the location just can't be beat. Overall they do a good job for a hotel that sees that much turnover. I would pay more if I had not got in on HW and still feel it was worth the stay. I am giving a 'very good' based on staff, rates,and location. I would stay in this hotel again."
28,828,Sep 19 2009 	I'd stay here again	We stayed here 5 years ago. We liked the location and decided to stay again. It was even better. The hotel has been updated and the staff in friendlier. It is a busy location. The room size is good. Everything is comfortable and works wells. The location close to a tube station and a grocery store is ideal. We would stay here again.
29,828,"Sep 8 2009 	average hotel in a good location	This hotel is in a good location. The tube is just a block away and there are restaurants and grocery stores within easy walking distance. The hotel itself is a typical chain hotel. The rooms were small but adequate and the empty fridge was a great ammenity. I liked being able to open the window but there was air conditioning also should you need it. If you want a reasonably priced place to stay in London in a convenient location, then this is a good choice!"
30,828,"Sep 8 2009 	Great if you can get a decent deal	Got a double room for 99 dollars on hotwire. Amazing deal for this place. It's so elegant and beautiful-- definitely not a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel feel if that's what you are looking for. Nice gym, nice restaurant, great reception desk, helpful concierge, nice rooms, option of getting different pillows if yours are uncomfortable for you. Overall very comfortable and pleasant stay, I would definitely return. However, a lot of the charm of London cannot be felt here because this hotel could be anywhere. To really feel like &quot;London&quot; try a boutique hotel-- there are tons in the South Ken area."
31,828,"Sep 7 2009 	Excellent Hotel Excellent location Would definately stay again!	Was slightly worried after reading some of the reviews on this site about what was waiting for me at this hotel however I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The room was spotless with a nice selection of toiletries in the bathroom which were re-stocked each day, also the bottle of water, fresh orange and kit kat chunky left each day was a nice touch too. Excellent choice at breakfast time which served til 11am at the weekend didnt mean a very early get up to make it in time. 2 mins walk from the tube and tons of little bars and restaurant within walking distance along with a Boots, Tesco, Waitrose &amp; sainsburys. Although we arrived at 12:30 pm and couldn't check in until 2pm there is a secure room to leave luggage so we were able to go for a wander in the mean time. Overall a great hotel for a great price, would definately stay here again!"
32,828,"Sep 3 2009 	Great Customer Service	In London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place - The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more.The food (buffet lunch) was wonderful, a selection of sandwiches, salads, cous cous and spicy wedge potato's, fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed.Bedrooms were fine for what was needed (a good night's rest) and when a feather pillow was requested I was greeted with a friendly confirmation it was on its way.I would definately stay here again - business or leisure.Just a short walk from Harrods.Short walk from the tube so no hassle with walking miles down the road."
33,828,"Sep 2 2009 	Much Better Than Some Reviews Suggest	My first hotel review ever. My wife and I are from Portland, Oregon, USA. We stayed for 16 nights at the Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum in June and July, 2009 while in London to attend Wimbledon. The less than enthusiastic reviews given this hotel do not reflect my experience. Cleanliness throughout was excellent. Room size was adequate. Rooms were well insulated from outside noise. Breakfast was good, with many choices and excellent service. Service in all areas, at all levels was good. There was a reasonably priced business center on-site. Gloucester Road tube station was only one short block away. There were many shops, grocery stores, and restaurants close to the hotel, including Internet cafes. Many of London's most famous attractions are within walking distance.Little things, taken for granted if they work, but irritants if they don't, were fine, such as: firm, comfortable beds; windows that open; adequate mirrors; clothes drying line across bathtub; sinks and showers drained properly; stopper in sink sealed, which was good because we did our own laundry; night shades overlapped the window and each other enough to keep light out; mini-bar refrigerator ran quietly; free newspapers daily in elevator waiting areas; in-room safe; American sized wash cloths; all lights worked; enough electrical outlets; enough hangers; central air conditioning which worked and ran quietly; adequate elevators; no toilet problems; shower curtains sealed water from leaking onto the floor; anti-slip surface on bathtub/shower; exhaust system in bathroom removed condensation from shower; always enough hot water in shower. There was free short term parking in the hotel's entry area when friends came to pick us up and drop us off. We only used it once, but there was a taxi rank right at the hotel. Our room rate included two full breakfasts, free bottled water and Kitkat candy bars each day and was very competitive with the rates at other hotels we considered. My only complaint: exorbitant phone charges, even for local calls, when using the in-room phone."
34,828,"Sep 2 2009 	Hotel just averaged...it served it's purpose	Got a $70/night deal for this hotel through Hotwire. Not sure what the regular rate is for a room, but I personally would not pay more than $100 for this hotel. It's rated 4-stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3-star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations. Hotel is one block from the Gloucester Rd station o the Picadilly line. Rooms are small, just large enough to fit the bed and get around it. Beds were comfortable and room clean. In-room internet is outrageously expensive at 15 pounds (or about $30) per day. Didn't try the restaurant or bar located in the Lobby, but checked out the menu and prices....and at 8 pounds (appx. $16) for a burger, I'd definitely venture out to the neighborhood and get something else. Overall, hotel is ok and served it's purpose of being a place with a clean bed to sleep in. Hotel appears to get a lot of Hotwire customers, and treats them accordingly...in other words, don't expect to be staying in a room with a view and you're most likely going to get the rooms near the elevator...but hey, if that means I save some cash that can be spent on better things in London, then I'll sleep in the elevator if necessary."
35,828,"Aug 30 2009 	great hotel in a lovely location	Got a great deal on this hotel and overall I was very impressed with it. Excellent location next to Gloucester Road tube station that has 3 train lines making getting around London really easy. The area around the hotel is safe with lots of restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but found no problems finding places to eat in the morning. The rooms are a decent size, and we appreciated the fridge in our room. Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant. I'd definitely go back again!"
36,828,"Aug 22 2009 	extremly helpfull staff	only spent one night at the hotel,,myself and my boy`s( aged 11and 12 ) had never been to london before,staff could not have been any more helpfull,they helped with places to see and how to get there,we were all treated with respect and no question we asked was treated as silly or a waste of time.The room was clean,tidy a good size and extremly quiet.Plenty of cheap places to eat out ,and Gloucester road tube station just around the corner,also a tesco express and waitrose nearby. Very good place to stay as easy to get to museums,buckingham palace etc. Would highly recomend it."
37,828,"Aug 21 2009 	Good location one excellent concierge but problems	Our family stayed here for 6 nights from Aug. 15th, to 20th, 2009. The location of the hotel is really good. We had two rooms and our rooms were clean and bright and beds were comfortable enough and it came with breakfast and kids under 12 eats free. I made the reservation 2 moths ago requesting for 2 connecting rooms and was told could not guarantee connecting rooms until later. I called long distance to the front desk of the hotel the night before I leave to make sure they remember to assign connecting rooms because my children are both under 12 years of age so I need to monitor them during the night. To my big surprise this hotel had not assigned any connecting room for our family and when I complained profoundly, they finally arranged a connecting room for our arrival. Now, house keeping is another annoying bit of this hotel. House keeping staffs do not do a very good job cleaning cups and spoons. The only nice friendly staff was a very professional concierge by the name of Peter. He is so good at his job that I am wondering why he works there. He should be working with much better establishment than this hotel."
38,828,"Aug 18 2009 	Maid Service Was Poor	We arrived at the hotel around 7:00 am. We knew that check-in time was 2:00 pm, but we thought we'd asked if the room might be ready. The front desk (a trainee) told us it might be a &quot;couple of hours&quot;. When we were about to step away from the desk, an employee at the next area over showed us a brochure that said that if we paid 30 pounds for breakfast for two, they could guarantee that the room would be ready in an hour. If not, then we'd have to wait. Being that we just had breakfast on the airplane, we decided to wait in the lobby for a &quot;couple of hours&quot;. I thought it was very tacky for the hotel to have this kind of offer. I've never run into anything like it. Either the room can be readied, or it can't. After waiting, we asked reception again. She said give her &quot;five more minutes&quot;. After waiting an hour longer. I finally asked a woman sitting (reading emails) at a Customer Relations desk about the status of our room. I wanted to know if we should wait a little longer or just come back at 2:00 pm. She called housekeeping, and the room was ready in 10 minutes! But....the bathroom smelled of urine. Over the coarse of our 6-day stay, housekeeping was very spotty. Dirty towels were taken, but not replaced. Same with used coffee mugs and cups. On the last day, we were left with no toilet paper (not even a square). Plus sides: near Gloucester Tube, walking distance to Harrods. Room decent enough. We had a queen and a twin (apparently they do not have too many of these)."
39,828,"Aug 17 2009 	Never read a book by its cover!!!	I got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary, for about 80 a night inc taxes, however after reading reviews about this hotel I was very worried about staying here....although I have to admit there was no need to be!!! From out side the hotel looked horrible, but once inside it is quite nice! on arrival the staff were very helpful, we arrived about 10am and they took our bags while we went to the national history museum (which is about a 10 min walk from the hotel!), when we arrived back at the hotel about 1, they had our room ready and upgraded us to an executive room. The room was a perfect size, spotlessly clean, and well equipped (hair dyer, iron, trouser press, tea/coffee facilitates etc).after returning from our dinner the staff had left a bottle of wine in the room and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, such a lovely touch!The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood and also right beside the tube station, Glouster road, and provided a direct route to the majority of the main sights. Additionally for the amount of rooms and people staying in the hotel I did not hear or see one person on out corridor in the whole 5 days we were there!I have stayed in 5 star hotels and other 4 stars, they may have more facilities ie: pool/spa etc, however as an all rounder the kensington forum is defiantly up there. They currently appear to be renovating the rooms once this is one I am sure it will be even better!So if you have booked this hotel, look forward to it and enjoy...cant wait for my next visit!"
40,828,"Aug 15 2009 	Great Location for Sightseeing	Almost right next to Gloucester Rd underground - easy walk but entrance to hotel not well signposted, we ended up walking three sides of the hotel to get in on arrival! A little biy of a delay at check in but staff very pleasant and helpful.Had requested a double room, not available at time of booking and no notes in the reservation about this but we could have had a double if we had wanted to wait. We were keen to get out and about so took the twin which was fine.The room was about what we expected from a Holiday Inn although we could have used a bottle or can opener given that there was no mini bar. Shower pressure could have been better but we were on the 16th floor with a great view.Full English breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed - staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time.We also had dinner in the hotel one night but would probably go out and check out some of the local cafes next time.Easy walking to Kensington Palace and Park and Hyde Park, museums and Harrods and easy to get around on the underground from there too.All in all, the hotel was great for our weekend stay and we would stay there again."
41,828,"Aug 14 2009 	Efficient hotel with a good location	The rooms are small as expected, but they have everything that you need. Some rooms have excellent view with the London Eye. The location is a block away from the underground station on the Picadilly Line direct from Heathrow Airport. The Internet is extremely expensive at 15 pounds per day. Breakfast is ok, but not worth paying for if it's not included in your room price. On our arrival day the hotel was overbooked, but they seemed to manage it fine, offering drink coupons to make up for having to wait for a couple of hours."
42,828,"Aug 13 2009 	Good quality great location	Literally around the corner from Gloucester Road Station, you can go anywhere in London within minutes on the tube. Sightseeing was our main priority and this hotel was a great base for exploring the city. We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip, and both times our double room was clean, comfortable, and a good size. Bathrooms were compact but modern and clean. If you're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please, this is a good place for you. If you're looking for a luxurious room to spend the day in, what are you doing in London anyway? P.S. Don't bring a car if you can avoid it, parking is EXPENSIVE."
43,828,"Aug 9 2009 	Good service	The first impression of the hotel was just ok, altought the lobby was roomy and quite a good looking. At the reception the service were exelent - altought during that five minutes I was standing there, the receptionists appologised three times! First was about a short que (only one receptionists, then when people started to show up, three more came), then about that he needed to go to the back room to check out if he could give me a double room instead of single and the thirth time that the printer was slow. At that time I tought that it was a little too much...The room was ok, but wallpaper were detahced on few places. Continental breakfast was not as good as I assumed."
44,828,Aug 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel - Great Location	Really good hotel we chose it because of the area as we had booked a concert in the Apollo at Hammersmith. We were very pleased with our room which also had aircon as it was very hot in London at that time. Superb breakfast and great fitness room. Close to Kensington Gardens and the Natural History Museum. Tube station just round the corner.
45,828,"Aug 7 2009 	Staff super every assistance given to disabled son	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights at the end of July as our adult son wanted to see a West End Show. We were a bit nervous as his severe disability makes finding suitable accommodation difficult but we had no need to worry. We found the hotel easily with the Sat Nav and there were two disabled parking spaces at the front. We had easy access to the hotel and even though we had arrived early they booked us in as soon as a suitable room became available shortly afterwards. We had two rooms with an interconnecting door which was a perfect arrangement and the accessible room had plenty of room for the wheelchair with a big bathroom (a bath rather than a walk-in shower but not a problem for us). At check in Stephen offered us the use of a hoist, something we have never been offered in a hote beforel. Fil arranged for breakfast to be brought to our room in the morning for the extremely reasonable tray charge of 2.50 per tray (only needed two) and the breakfast was delicious. The public areas were all spacious, there was plenty of room in the lift and the corridors and doors were wide enough for a larger than average wheelchair. Accessible London Taxis were outside the door any time we wanted to go out and the drivers were extremely helpful. Many places of interest such as the V &amp; A, Science Museum etc. were actually within walking distance and the theatre was a fairly short taxi drive. The concierge provided all the information we needed and the various door men could not have been more helpful in spite of the volume of business (it is a big and busy hotel). All in all we had a really relaxing short break in this hotel and I would not look any further for accommodation in London."
46,828,"Aug 7 2009	Good Location New Room Bad Service 	The hotel was a great location just 1 block from Tube, Grocery Stores, Pharmacy and 2 blocks from Natural History and Victoria &amp; Albert Museums. This is the hotel's best feature. Alas service is not.My room was good size for European standards, and had recently been overhauled and included hair dryer, fridge, and air conditioning. Everything worked just fine. The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service. Getting to the rooms was slowed by construction crews working on other floors and a horrible elevator which requires your room key to operate.I was unable to check into my room until 5:30 pm losing an afternoon of sightseeing, but that was better than others in line who were sent to other hotels because they had overbooked. After the ridiculous delays, I did get upgraded breakfast and demanded and got 50% off internet. That was a substantial savings as internet is 15 GBP for 24 hrs.. Most employees could care less that they are there to serve you, and it was a constant problem at the front desk, at the coffee bar, and with the porters. The Concierge desk was exceptional. The Gentlemen there helped us speak with a doctor, gave good directions, and helped us find an excellent Indian restaurant. The breakfast was good, and never had to wait to be seated. That was run well. I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems. If you get a good room rate, then they are worth overlooking. Try and get an upper floor room, as they seem to be cleaned first."
47,828,"Aug 1 2009 	Excellent stay	We stayed for 8 nights in two executive rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We came in early and they got us in our rooms by noon (normal check in at 2:00). The hotel was very clean with an excellent A/C system. The beds though a bit firm were at least queen sized and sported very comfortable pillows. They provided us with a free bottle of water, a can of OJ and candy bar every day. The elevators were very fast, we never waited pore than 1-2 minutes (unlike one review which complained they were slow). We like to sleep late and often did not get out until noon or later. The maids always made up our room. The conceirege was available 24 hours per day and always helpful. The hotel was located on block away from the Glouster tube station (a station with multiple lines) making getting around London very easy. The hotel is located in a quiet and upscale area. We always felt safe walking around. We did not try the hotel restaurant. One local restaurant stood out for having excellent food, &quot;Olives&quot; located one block away. When I go back to London, I would definitely go back to this hotel."
48,828,"Jul 28 2009 	Poor serviceNot friendly assistance	The hotel entrance is not easy to find from main road from the station. Only a small sign.Reception staff was very unfriendly, they talk each other for long time ,even if I was asking about a question. It is not 4 star hotel service. When my room key didn't work, they forced me to come to reception desk and nothing appologize. The concierge was also not kind for customer. They let us wait , answered very rude. The lobby was big but the room was very small, I won't stay there any more."
49,828,"Jul 27 2009 	Poor Customer Service	The &quot;Guest&quot; rooms are small and come with twin beds which were not the most comfortable. We were supposed to have a double bed and we were told that was what we booked. They would not upgrade up because we used a travel agent. Other than the poor attitude of the reception the other things worth mentioning is the mold in the shower and absolutely nothing in the mini fridge. What exactly is the point of having it in the room if there's nothing in it? If you upgraded to the next level room, the fridge was stocked. We stayed there before and after our cruise was over and it happened we decided to go to Paris for one day. Had it not been for the hotel confirmation that I made a copy of they did not want to give us a room even though it was already paid for months in advance."
50,828,"Jul 23 2009 	GREAT HOTEL! :-)	I thought this hotel was great. I traveled alone and felt completely safe . The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. My room was very clean, bed was comfy and always made by the time I arrived back each day. (I stayed for 9 nights)The tube station was a 2 min walk from the hotel which was awesome. Across the street from the tube station was a Tesco (grocery store), Burger King, KFC and other restaurants. There was also an internet cafe nearby. I walked to the History Museum and the Science Museum. The location was perfect.It wouldve been even more perfect if they threw in a microwave or a mini fridge! But hey, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return again."
51,828,"Jul 21 2009 	Convenient location not 4-star room and services but OK	Convenient as close to tube station. When we check in, they give us a smoking room with 2 twin beds although we request double bed and non smoking when we book it at expedia. But they claim that it's only a request but not guaranteed. We manage to change it to a non-smoking double bed room the 2nd night. During our 7-nights stay, we've to re-program the keys (both) a couple times, don't know if owing to put it too close with the Oyster Card or not.Room size is fine as of European standard, it's clean and tidy. Good to have different kinds of electic outlet, so I can charge our camera, laptop without an adaptor.During the last day of our stay, we've got an invoice charging us $67+tax for accomdation, but we've paid everything before we come, so we go ask them. Although they take it off for us but with no apology and just ask us to pay $2.50 for the phone charge. Concierge desk - only one of them is good, other is either not so polite or not so knowledgeable.Because it's only $67pounds/ night (internet rate), there're many AA crews stay there, we see them in and out every day we're there."
52,828,"Jul 19 2009 	Great location but definitely NOT a 4 star hotel	I hotwired a 4 star hotel with a gym in the Kensington area and this is the hotel that we ended up with for $170/nt. Not great but served its purpose as a decent hotel in a bustling area.LOCATION - this hotel is located around the block from the Gloucester tube station (get an Oyster card), 3 grocery stores, several fast food restaurants open until 1 AM (KFC, Burger Kind, starbucks, Falafel places), several restaurants and 2 great gastropubs (Hereford Arms is the one to go to (free wifi) -- skip the &quot;aimed at American tourists&quot; Stanhope Arms) and a few ATM machines. Tourist buses have a pick up/drop off at the tube station and the hotel is walking distance to many museums and Harrod's. Bobo's Bubbles is a must for anyone wanting to save some money and launder your clothes by yourself. It's down the street and so convenient.ROOM and SERVICE - our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones. Even though I requested a true king or queen bed, our room was a 2 twin that was hastily assembled into a king which meant that one of us was always falling into the gap between the beds. The TV was primitive and the fridge which we thought would be an absolute must was utterly useless as it was just an empty mini bar with the little liquor bottle spaces and fixed shelves so we could not put anything except cans in it. The beds were not very comfortable and the door to the bathroom was a sliding door that did not lock.Service was a joke -- the &quot;evening concierge&quot; doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything -- honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is &quot;why don't you go to the bar in the hotel?&quot; -- really? The day concierge, on the other hand, was quite amicable and knew a lot about tourist attractions and had great suggestions. The sink in our room clogged up completely on the 5th day and we called downstairs 4 times and noone came to resolve the problem. After that we ended up brushing our teeth and washing our hands in the tub (not joking here). The room keys were problematic -- in our 6 night stay, we had to have our keys reprogrammed 4 times. Another gentleman also noted that he had the same problemAMENITIES - the gym was actually not too bad. The cardio machines were newer but a few had computer issues causing them to either completely stop or reset the program. There was a leak with the water dispenser causing a slight flood near the electrical outlets - this was a little scary. The fitness room key also did not work and had to be rekeyed 2 times. It's the 21st century -- it is unacceptable for any 4 star hotel to not offer free wifi. End of story. This is no longer a perk -- it's a necessity.As an SPG member, I try to stay loyal to Starwood hotels but I would not stay at anymore of their Holiday Inns if this one is indicative of the quality of European Holiday Inns . BUT, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a well located, no frills hotel if cost is not an issue."
53,828,"Jul 18 2009 	Great location but is it really 4 star?	Stayed here in september last year with my partner for a few days to go to the theatre and see the sights in London. Rather than write a novel, I'll just give a list of the good and bad points.Good:- Great location (2 mins walk from tube station)- Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet.- Restauraunt staff very efficient and helpful.- Good pub, with all the latest sports shown on multiple TV's, friendly bar staff. Got busy at weekend, but to be expected really.- Helpful staff at front desk, gave good advice on where to eat locally.- Clean bedsheets; bathroom.- Local shops, mini-market etc- Situated in quite up-market area.- Nice views of city as hotel has goodness knows how many floors. We were on 9th floor and got a decent view.- Quiet room, got very good sleep on a comfy bed. You know how important a comfy bed is.Bad:- Not convinced this should be classed as 4 star. I can't see what sets it apart from other 3-star hotels I've stayed in - other than the fact it's in London, in a posh area and has good food.- Building is a bit dated, it's stuck in an era.- Decor in room was a bit dated.- Room was smaller than I thought it was going to be. Only really for crashing in for the night. You'd get depressed if you had to sit in it all day (due to bad weather etc).- We asked for a non-smoking but ended up in a smoking room. So naturally it had a smell of smoke.- Air-conditioning made smoke smell even worse, to the point that my eyes were almost watering. Woke up with sore, dry throat every morning.- No iron or ironing board. Not very handy seeing as we were going to the theatre at night and not able to iron out airplane baggage hold creases from clothes! I knew this when I booked though, but it would be a nice addition (considering what you pay).All in all, it was a decent hotel, but I think I may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price. I'd recommend it for a few days stay as it's so close to the tube station and you do get a good breakfast and a comfy bed. Make sure, however, that you get a non-smoking room, as the smoke smell did begin to annoy us a bit. The fact it's in a decent area makes it feel quite safe too.As for the 4-star rating, I'm not convinced - but I reckon that a lot of hotels in London get away with high prices and over the top star ratings purely because their in London. If this hotel was in some other city in the UK, it would definitely be 3-star in my book.Hope this helps."
54,828,"Jul 16 2009 	Great Location.	We had a good time at the Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum. The location was only a five minute walk from the Gloucester Road Tube stop. We had a few snags with the check, but after that we had a good stay. We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food."
55,828,"Jul 12 2009 	Well-located practical comfortable hotel	Large, straightforward, practical hotel, doesn't try to be quaint. Caters to US and many nationalities, tour groups, air crew, business, etc. Service impersonal but friendly. Comfortable room, not large but OK for London, clean, handy coffee maker, no safe, nice bathroom, good view across London. A/C either ineffective or not turned on but was just Spring, so room was comfortable/cool with window opened for fresh air. No problem with noise - was on 15th floor or so. Great location, near Gloucester Road tube station, handy cluster of cafes, shops, couple of pubs, plus supermarket in the station complex. Didn't pay for pricey breakfast in hotel - plenty of places nearby. 10 minutes walk from Kensington Gardens, Natural History Museum, V&amp;A Museum. South Kensington is a nice, safe-feeling district with a mixture of residential, and hotel areas and shop/restaurant clusters."
56,828,"Jul 12 2009	Great Location Great Hotel	My mother and I stayed here for a quick night before Christmas. The room was very reasonably priced, but very small. If you are coming with a lot of luggage (say more than 2 suitcases!) request a larger room! The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny as well. For the price and location, this was a very great hotel. There is a tube stop just a short walk away. This hotel looked like a large Holiday Inn that you would see in the states. There was a restaurant, business center, gift shop, etc.. Cabs are always waiting outside, which was very helpful!"
57,828,"Jul 11 2009 	Good location clean and comfortable	I got a great rate through Priceline, $90, during pre Xmas weekend in London. The hotel is in Kensington which is not as central as I'd like to be, but it's a 3 minute walk to the Gloucester Road tube station. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well, including fast food joints and two small-ish supermarkets.The hotel is huge and our room was on the large side for London. Good air conditioning (which I use even in winter), clean, nice sized bathroom, etc. Did not use any of the hotels other services, but I was pleased overall and would stay here again."
58,828,"Jul 9 2009 	Great location but not sure it's worth the money	Stayed here because it was free with a British Airways booking. It's in a great location. Love this area because it's within walking distance to museums, Hyde Park, and High St. Kensington where you'll find a great selection of restaurants. It was a good quality room although the bed was and pillows were very firm. The fridge isn't really a fridge. It's an old one from which you could purchase drinks and snacks, so it doesn't keep anything very cold. We couldn't change the thermostat to cooling. It was set on heating and our room had the afternoon sun blaring in making it uncomfortably warm. Had to notify housekeeping to switch it to cooling, but 2 things- they never answered the phone and it would stay on cooling for a while but would revert back to heating. Very odd and annoying as housekeeping never answered their phone (I don't know how you are supposed to get those pillows from the pillow menu.). Switched to a Holiday Inn Express and could change the thermostat there, so I don't get it. The hotel pub has a late liquor license, albeit there can be rowdy tourists in there getting drunk for the first time in years. It's a decent hotel, although I wouldn't spend a great deal of money on a room here. The Holiday Inn Express in Earl's Ct cost $43 via hotwire.com and was actually more comfortable. It's not as fancy, but it's really good value. What you are really paying for at this hotel is location and in hotel restaurants."

We had a fold out bed for our daughter and the first room they gave us we could not get to the bathroom with the sofa folded out. They changed our room for the rest of our stay but the room was not as nice and had a smaller folding bed (so we could walk around it). That was a bit disappointing, but not unusual. We had difficulties finding family rooms often during our trip. Otherwise the hotel was very nice. Concierge was more than helpful. Fantastic location very close to the tube and buses. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Pub in the hotel which served meals."
60,828,Jul 1 2009	nice stay	I stayed here for two nights while on a group tour of Europe. It was a pretty good value and in a good location. The rooms were smaller than rooms in the States (but so are most rooms in Europe). The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.
61,828,Jul 1 2009 	Change your category from 4 stars to 3 stars	I sent an e-mail beforehand to the hotel booking and asked them to reseve a room with a good view. What we got was a room where the hotel wall was on the left side and a roof under our window with full of cabbage. And the windows were very dirty. The fridge did not work ! One of the lamps was broken. This was my husband's first visit to London and probably the last one (He is 80 years old). We changed our hotel reservation to a better category (so we believed!) just a few days before our departure and paid for this change 65 euros!!.
62,828,"Jun 30 2009 	great hotel	i have been there in february 2009 for five nights.i was alone. the staff made me feel like home. i stayed again for three nights in june 2009 with my mother. once more,everybody did his best to help us. both times they gave me non-smoking confortable rooms with a great view. i have stayed in much more expensive hotels in london but they were terrible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
63,828,"Jun 24 2009 	Good value	We stayed in Kensington forum for 3 nights in January. Price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds/night. We wanted something more spacious, but this hotel had extremely convenient location and good reviews, so we decided to stay there.Room wasn't that big but looks like brand new, bed was very comfy (I love holiday inn's pillow menu^_^). Bathroom also was very clean with no smell of chemistry.The only problem we had with fridge. It didn't work. We call reception and in 10-15 minuts problem was solved!1 thing I was disappointed - they took incredible deposit, about 300 pounds (we made payment for room 100% in advance). next time i would say that I have only cash."
64,828,"Jun 13 2009 	OK hotel in Central London	The Holiday Inn was a mixed bag I found during my recent stay. The positives, great location, just a few minutes from a tube station which makes touring easy and with a travelcard taking midday breaks is easy. They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town. The rooms were average size with a good sized bathroom as well. Now the down size, I only really have two complaints with the Holiday Inn. First was my bed was hard as a rock, I woke up very sore each morning from sleeping on the bed. Second, while some of the staff was very nice and friendly, some were quite rude and uninterested in helping guests. When I checked out the lady at reception seemed annoyed that I needed to check out early in the morning to catch my flight, in addition when trying to get theatre tickets with the concierge, halfway thought trying to book for me he hands me the phone and lets me know its his break time and walks off, leaving me with the phone and not knowing who Im talking too or whats going on.If they got better beds and more friendly staff I would stay here again."
65,828,"Jun 12 2009 	Good Location	Apart from the location, the hotel was really not up to standard. The staff were not very helpful. The rooms were rather small and basic. There was no free Internet unlike the previous hotels we had stayed in during this trip. The bathroom doors had no locks! We chose Holiday Inn for its past reputation...Unfortunately they have to keep with the times and improve on the facilities. We will never return to this hotel."
66,828,"Jun 2 2009 	Tiny room malfunctioning heater	The room was tiny, and the heater didn't work properly, The staff if great. The cabbie that took us to the train station said most of his fares say the same thing &quot; great staff but I wouldn't stay there again&quot;. If you take the underground from Heathrow, be advised that there is a long steep set of stairs to the lift that takes you to the surface. Pack light or you'll be sorry."
67,828,"May 26 2009 	Nice room good location	This isn't as charming as the other Holiday Inn (soon to be a Crowne Plaza) on Cromwell Street. It's a large hotel and seems more geared towards visitors in London on business. We stayed for one night as the other Holiday Inn was full. I was pleased that we were able to get a room on such short notice. The room was fine. The decorating was a bit out-dated, but the view was good and the beds were comfortable. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and a restaurant and a pub on the property. It is very close to the tube -- just walk out the front entrance, take a right and then another right on Gloucester road. It's a two minute walk at most."
68,828,"May 22 2009 	Got a great deal on Priceline!	We generally use Priceline whenever we can because we always get a great deal. We got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find. This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel. Using Priceline, we usually get this one or the Copthorne Tara, but I prefer the Forum. It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time. Let's face it, just because the hotel is 4 star does NOT mean your room will be, but this really isn't too bad. The rooms have a kettle with tea and coffee (I love that most hotels in Britain do this), but we had to call down to get an iron and an ironing board. The room also had a fridge which is great to store orange juice and anything else you might need, but the fridge really could have used a good scrubbing! I noticed that another reviewer said the same thing. Overall, I like this hotel. The rooms are a bit more updated than those at the Copthorne, but I think that both hotels are more comparable to a 3 star rating. Oh, and it is helpful to remember that you are in London so, yes, the rooms are going to be a bit smaller than those you have stayed in before."
69,828,"May 21 2009 	Great location great hotel	When travelling with teenagers, conveniance is the key. Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is located 3 minutes from the tube station South Kensington. It is a large business hotel, with good weekend deals. We were given a fairly spacious room on the 17th floor, with a fantastic view of London. Large, well lit bathroom and the latest films on pay-tv. We arrived at 11 am, but were able to check in with the professional and service-minded staff right away. The concierge was also very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was expensive, but there are numerous coffee shops nearby. A short bus trip to Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, as well as the Museum of Natural History. A very short tube ride to Harrod's og Kensington High Street. A great stay, reasonably priced, very recommended."
70,828,"May 19 2009 	excellent location friendly staff	Stayed at this hotel 15-17 May 2009. Hotel is in good location. Bus to Marble Arch stops outside front of hotel, tube station [Gloucester Road] round the corner. The Natural History Museum and the Science Museum are less than 10mins walk away, Victoria and Albert Museum just a bit further.The rooms are a reasonable size with comfortable beds. We were lucky enough to be on the 15th floor with a good view. Breakfast was very good. Plenty of choice and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They were very friendly and even on the busiest of mornings arranged tables for the six of us to sit together.We would definitely stay here again."
71,828,"May 18 2009 	What a disappointment	This hotel was the second-worst I've ever stayed in...and we certainly did not expect that for what we were paying. Housekeeping was so substandard to be frightening (the mini-bar fridge was really dirty and there was a fingernail clipping in our bed on the last night we were there...and many other issues), and the front desk staff was the least friendly or accommodating I've ever encountered. Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service...and smiling. There were times when I called the front desk and then the concierge...and never got an answer. It took three calls and well over an hour to get the heat turned off and the air conditioner turned on in our room -- something that you cannot do yourself in the room. On the plus side, the staff in the breakfast room was wonderful and friendly, as was the fine waitress the one night we had dessert at the ground-floor restaurant. The Business Center was laughable...and only open during business hours, and not at all over the weekend. This hotel is to be avoided...it's shabby-looking on the inside and has serious cleanliness issues."
72,828,"May 18 2009 	good location	went for a city break with the family hotel good location harrods 20 mins walk,royal albert hall 10 mins,and under ground around the corner,plenty to see and do around hotel.staff at hotel friendly rooms a good size will be going back in august breakfast good.i nearly never went after some peoples reviews but it pays to find out for yourself have a good stay."
73,828,"May 18 2009	Better than I expected for such a large and busy hotel...	We were in England on a group tour, so we didn't choose where to stay. I had read some negative reviews on this hotel before we left. So I am pleased to say I found the hotel to be just fine.I will say they seem to be inflexible about their 2 pm check-in time. Our group arrived at 10 am. First we were told the rooms might be ready at noon, and then 2 pm. Ours was ready at 2:45. I think this is because they start cleaning rooms at the top of the 26-stories. I went to a higher floor for ice and saw them up there cleaning early. You will see a lot of airline flight crews come and go, and I noticed they don't seem to check in, and the ones I shared an elevator with were near the top, so I assume that is why the upper story rooms are cleaned first.Do what we did  have them store your luggage and go scout around the neighborhood. It is a great location. Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters. Also, there is a Waitrose grocery store nearby that has slices of great salmon pies (and other types) and rotisserie chicken to help save on eating out. There is a Eurochange ATM in one of those money exchange places right near the tube station. It says there is no charge to get money and it is true. We used it twice and it even turned out the exchange rate was terrific  though we didn't find that out until we got home. This is the ATM, not the live money exchange at the counter. Harrods and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens and the Victoria and Albert Museum are all also in walking distance of the hotel.Ice seems to be an issue in England. There was an ice machine and a microwave machine up on the 25th floor. (At least I think it was that floor  ask at the desk).One oddity  when you enter the room, you have to slide a key card into a slot by the door to run your lights. Conserves electricity! You also have to turn switches by the outlets on before lamps and other electrical things work. There is a small fridge that used to have a mini-bar but not any more. Ours worked fine. The elevators were fast and avaialble during our stay. But you may need to use your key card to operate them.Our breakfasts and one dinner meal were included in our price. The dinner meal was good, but I expect it would have been overpriced if we had to pay for it. The buffet breakfasts seemed fine the first couple of times, but it turns out all four chain hotels we stayed at in England served almost the identical variety for their full English breakfast. And I think they were pricy too, If we had been paying for breakfasts we would have gone elsewhere.We are low maintenance so we didn't have to request service much, but when we did it was fine. I would definitely stay there again  better the devil you know!"
74,828,"May 13 2009 	Great location bad hotel	In April we spent 5 nights at this hotel to see the sights of London before a cruise. We &quot;upgraded&quot; our room from a standard to an excutive room for and extra 175 pounds (or about $260) and got a room that was maybe 150 sq ft, the bathroom was tiny and had a pocket door that was heavy and hard to close, the whole room needed to be updated. When we tried to use a phone card from our room it would not work so I asked the front dest to help me and was told they couldn't (really!?!) but they were happy to charge me 2.50+ pounds for each try to make a call even though it never connected!! So if you like hotel employees that just don't care then THIS is the place to stay! One good aspect of this hotel was the location, it is about 2 blocks to the tube station, shopping and eating."
75,828,"May 12 2009 	dated rooms	We booked this hotel due to its proximity to the Royal Albert Hall, also close to museums and within walking distance of Harrods. It's a shame it's so dated as its not cheap! We asked for a room with a view  see picture for the view we got! Our room was small and the wooden furniture was badly chipped and marked. The cool box was dirty and broken. We recently stayed in the Crown Plaza on the South Bank which was cheaper and a hundred times better than this hotel."
76,828,"May 12 2009 	Just about OK	Stayed here on business. Lobby nice enough, but corridors and rooms defintely showing their age and are pretty shabby. Breakfast equally tired - although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel. I was 'upgraded' to a room that wasn't stunning or large - hate to think what regular room is like.Wouldn't stay here again - there are better options in London for the same money."
77,828,"May 11 2009 	It's okay	I wanted to find a hotel that's located on a direct tube line between King Cross and the airport since I travelled back in to London from Paris (was in London a couple weeks before and stayed at County Hall). It was not exactly an easy job if it's going to satisfy a few criterias and was made even harder by the fact that we were a couple with a young child. Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc.And so we ended with HI Forum. One day late and I paid the same price for a better room in HI Kensington, the supposedly better classed HI nearby (may be a blessing since it was still under renovations when we were there).We had an executive room and was disappointed to find that the extra bed was not done up and we had to call housekeeping to fold down the metal bed. Space between bed and the long table was a little tight. The wooden table looks cheap. Nothing very executive about this room except they supplied a soft drink and a snack. However I am overall satisfied with the room.Location is not very good since one has to travel by tube to shop or sightsee. However the tube is really close by and it satisfied my requirements for easy travel from King Cross and the airport.Not too happy with the service from frontdesk, concierge and housekeeping."
78,828,"May 2 2009 	Great hotel to book for traveling in London	We took our two grandchildren to London during April school vacation and booked two rooms at the Holidy Inn Kensington Forum Hotel. We were very happy staying there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet full English breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food. The twin rooms were typical European and smaller than in America, but with all the amenities we needed including facecloths. The location to the Gloucester Road tube station was very handy. The hotel is located in a very nice neighborhood, an easy walk to Kensington Palace, Natural History Museum and packed with lots of nice pubs and restaurants. We felt &quot;safe&quot; in this neighborhood. There is a nice pub/restaurant located within the hotel for a late nite G&amp;T too. We thought it was a very good hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to London."
79,828,Apr 28 2009 	nice place to stay	i stayed here for a week and really nice hotel with tube station in 5 mins distance.really nice hotel for buissnessnot much around in terms of shoppin etcfood was ok
80,828,"Apr 27 2009 	Everything about this hotel was first class including the food!	My 9 year old son and I stayed at this hotel from Friday to Sunday. We chose it due to its location i.e. 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum and I am so very pleased that we did as it is a great hotel. Everything was great! The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful (not that we had any problems). The room (executive) was very nice with a king size bed and a full size double sofa bed which was very comfortable and easy to use. The hotel was extremely clean which is always on the top of my list of priorities! The nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which I hadn't expected in a large chain hotel. We ate in the Consortia restaurant both nights (was so good the first night that we decided to eat there again the second night. Even the chef was very friendly! Wish i could have taken him home! Breakfast was very good too. I really cannot think of one bad thing to say about this hotel but could go on about how very happy I was that we had decided to stay there! We would definitely stay there again! My son was especially happy with the free chunky KitKats and soft drinks that were left in our room each day. I was also very happy with the security of the place (being a woman traveling alone with a small (ish) child. Felt very safe in the hotel and the surrounding area. Very close to Glouster Rd tube station. Well done to the hotel, I can see why they have recently won some awards."
81,828,"Apr 24 2009	Great location for first time traveller	I recently returned from my first trip to England, and my tour group spent five nights at the London Kensington Forum. I found the rooms, public spaces, and dining area to be very clean and welcoming. I was impressed upon arrival by the sight of several airline pilots and staff in the lobby. When I approached one stewardess, she assured me that her airline used Holiday Inn Kensington Forum on a regular basis because of its location. It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places. I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly. Our only problem was with check-in, and they could not find my name in my group's records. After a 30 minute wait, they found my info. Our group got free continental breakfast with our room. I really cannot comment on the rate because we had a package deal for the entire trip, and I don't have a clue what our room rate was. Our room was small but tasteful. I do wish they had double rooms with double beds, but I was so exhausted when I went to be, I don't believe I even turned over, so I managed with the twin bed just fine."
82,828,"Apr 23 2009 	Just fine for our trip	We stayed at the Kensington Forum for 5 nights on a recent trip to London. It was conveniently located about 2 blocks from the Tube Station. There is a very good French bakery, Paul's, across from the station as well as a Grocery store that was very well stocked. We did not eat at the hotel. The rooms are quite small but everything we needed was there.The high speed internet was expensive so we did not opt for that and there was very limited T.V. The refrigerator did not work, and when we asked about it were informed that a refrigerator did not come with our room, even though it was in the room. They had disconnected it, which I thought was pretty cheap. Otherwise it was a good choice for us."
83,828,Apr 21 2009 	Average	Hotel was super average nothing great about it at all except the location. We got to the hotel and took the first room open. After realizing that the room was 'Smoking&quot; we went downstairs to change rooms and they told us the entire hotel was booked. We tried to open the windows but this too was a difficult task. Not thrilled about the stay at all
84,828,"Apr 18 2009 	Mixed experience	Since everyone starts with the good that I agree with - great location, very clean, I'll state the not-so good. If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here. We were there over the Easter holiday and the business center where you could get access to computers was closed for 4 days. We spoke to several concierges and none of them were able to give us any information on what was open and closed. Once the business center was opened we learned that it is operated by a separate company and you had to pay to use the computers, about $3.00 USA per half hour and approx .25 cents per page to print. There was no water pressure in our shower. We unfortunately found ourselves on a floor with a tour group of high school kids (even though we requested at booking and at checkin to be on a quite floor) and calls to the front desk to complain at 1 &amp; 2 am that they were running around the halls didn't help, no one came to address the problem. Good news: The hotel room was very clean and the cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very attentive. The location was great."
85,828,"Apr 16 2009 	Great location nice stay!	We booked this hotel in combination with a deal from British Airways, and couldn't have been happier. Visiting London was great, and I didn't want to spend any more time INSIDE a hotel then needed, and the Kensington Forum made the ease of the trip all the more convenient. Check-in was simple, and we made our way to the room in an elevator/lift that whisked us up to the 20th floor in a matter of seconds. The room was clean, organized, and provided a great view of London. Better then we expected really. The hotel does offer a pub, with several televisions and delicious beer. One of the best features of this hotel is the LOCATION. Just a very short walk to the Underground station at Gloucester Road on the Piccadilly Line, several restaurants, and a great area for walking. Take advantage of it!"
86,828,Apr 15 2009 	Excellent location...	Thoroughly enjoyable stay! The hotel's location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping (down on the corner) and the Tube. The staff were great and the concierge desk especially were outstanding! Will stay for sure the next time we are in London....
87,828,Apr 13 2009 	Overbooked and bounced around	Despite making and confirming our reservations months in advance with our tour scheduled through Virgin when we arrived after a long flight and no sleep we were forced to waste the first day of our holiday making alternate accomodations and scheduled pick up changes.
88,828,"Apr 10 2009 	Location great but hotel dated	Tower block hotel in fantastic location near good shops, bars and restaurantsThe positives about the place are the views from the windows if you have an upper floor room, and the location next to Gloucester Road tube station and a small shopping areaHowever the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result - the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service ( the concierge proved the exception to this)The breakfast room is &quot;cattle market&quot; like with queues for tables and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas - the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels - the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotelFor a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location"
89,828,"Apr 10 2009 	Excellent Choice for a home base to explore London	We stayed 6 nights in the beginning of April 2009 and we thoroughly enjoyed the Holiday Inn Forumn. We are in our mid twenties and the hotel was clean, and in a great residential neighborhood. We requested a room on a high floor before we left and this wish was granted with a 15th floor room with a view for miles (it was great!). There are few hotels in London that can offer such views from our research. The room was made daily. The room size was as expected, bigger then hotels in south beach, yet smaller then some resorts in the caribbean - however that being said, the room size is more than enough and we had several pieces of luggage in the room. There were two cushioned chairs and a nice table in the room as well. There are 2 american outlets in the room ( one at the desk and one in the bathroom). All in all, we spent most of our trip in London out exploring, and we looked forward to coming back at night to wash up and go to sleep. The front desk staff were a bit snippy, try and avoid the lady named Fil - she was not very accommodating or courteous. As a guideline we paid USD $949 each for roundtrip direct flights on American Airlines from JFK and 6 nights accommodations on Priceline. Hope this helps, feel free to contact me with any questions!!!Gerard"
90,828,"Apr 8 2009 	Not a four-star hotel as claimed	Standard rooms in this hotel fall far short of usual London four-star standard - they are small, have no safe, pants press or other amenities usually provided. Hotel reception staff are brusque and unwelcoming and lobby is spare and utilitarian."
91,828,"Apr 3 2009 	Great location	Living in Wales, the access to this hotel could not be simpler - Cromwell Road is just an extension of the M4 eastbound! Car parking at the hotel is a bonus. The hotel ambience hits the right notes with plenty of friendly staff to help with luggage, car parking and check in. Rooms compact but comfortable."
92,828,"Apr 1 2009 	Nice hotel with great location for transportation	We've stayed at this hotel before and it's always been a great choice for it's location, cleanliness and staff. The room was nice size with a small but adequate bathroom. There was internet availability in the room, a small refrigerator, coffee maker with coffee, tea, and chocolate. When we arrived the refrigerator wasn' t working but they replaced it quickly. We used it for keeping snacks and drinks cool that we bought instead of using the minibar. The bed was a nice size but it could have been a little softer. One problem we did have was having to replace our keycard 3 times. It quit working in the elevator and the door. An inconvenience but nothing big. The tube station is only a few mins walk which is very convenient."
93,828,"Mar 31 2009 	very nice hotel	very nice hotel. very good location, next to underground station, very near to city center.the rooms are very nice like a 4-star hotel, and nothing less.the breakfast is really good.\the staff is very friendlyi had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible. if you find a nice deal on that do not try to avoid it, choose it at once"
94,828,Mar 30 2009 	Not Good but not bad	Excellent location. Satyed in Suite room with breakfast. Only postive is their breakfast service. Rest not to the standard of even 3 star.
95,828,"Mar 29 2009 	just plain average	The hotel is conveniently located (a couple of blocks from the Gloucester Road station of the Picaddilly line from Heathrow Airport). Just about everything else in the city (Westminster, major museums, the theater district, etc.) is within easy reach using the nearby Picaddilly or Circle lines. The place also does a decent breakfast; but don't expect anything more than just average from anything at this hotel: i.e. the rooms are a bit cramped; you have to run the hot water in the shower for a few minutes before it actually gets warm; the rooms have a tea/coffee facility but they don't have a fridge, just a fridge-looking plastic cooler. Still, I've gotten much worse hotels in London, and for a short tourist/business stay, this place'll do."
96,828,Mar 26 2009 	Convenient location Great Concierge service	It was my first time to London and I booked this hotel through Expedia. The tube is literally around the corner and it is a straight shot to Heathrow off the Piccadilly line. It isn't the most central location but I found it easy enough to get into London. I have to thank Antonio and Frederick for helping us figure out how to get to Luton airport in time for our 8am flight. They were so incredibly helpful and helped to spare us from an exorbitant taxi fare to the far-flung Luton. I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service.
