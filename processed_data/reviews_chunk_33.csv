1,709,Nov 19 2009 	would prefer to pay more	Small completely bare bones rooms. A swung cat would soon be brained. Have been pared down too far so even things like a shelf in the bathroom are missing and had to put toiletries on top of the radiator. Zero storage apart from a few hooks on the wall. Very little room to manoeuvre around the room if there are two of you. Can fit luggage at base of bed but then need to climb over each other to use the bathroom in the night. Has aircon but still hot so not a good night's sleep which was important before a long haul. Noisy fire doors can easily be heard. The one socket is inconveniently above the bed head. The lurid orange wall behind the bed is a very bad idea. Very handy for Paddington to Heathrow.
2,709,"Nov 6 2009 	Ok deal but then again it's London	I wanted the cheapest room avail with a good central location and cleanliness. This fits the bill. First of all, I read the reviews, so I knew the room would be a closet. There was only area around the bed to walk, no closet. The bathroom was tiny too; you could even wash your hand while still sitting on the toilet. Not that I would, that's just how small the bathroom was. They provide you with soap and shampoo from a dispenser. I preferred the toiletry I brought. The service was lackluster. I was told that the room would be 39 GBP per night, but it came out to like 50 something. The problem is that they just give you the total price and don't itemize the costs for you. So I assume that the VAT was not included in the advertised price...even so that's big increase...so there must have been some other fees. The front desk person was not helpful. They said that they could not pull up the info on their computer. I guess that's what keeps the cost down. Despite paying about 100 USD a night, this was still a great deal for this area. We paid extra to have internet...I don't remember...20ish GBP for 5 days or something. The area was great. This was a 3 min walk from the Paddington Tube Station, and had lots of convenience stores and restaurants around. About a 10-15 min walk to Hyde Park. Rooms are not cleaned while you're there...I think you pay extra 10 GBP for that. Bottom line: Don't expect much and you'll be satisfied. Great location, lackluster service."
3,709,"Oct 21 2009 	At the base rate of 25 it might be just about ok but don't pay more.	I understand the EasyHotel concept. It's ultra-basic in return for being ultra-cheap. I've stayed at Earls Court and Heathrow EasyHotels and been happy with both.But this was very poor. I got told off by a staff member for pressing the intercom button because I thought the door was locked (and the web site suggests it will be locked upon arrival) which didn't really create a very welcoming feeling. Then there was the room itself. The small size is to be expected but the room just seemed worn and uncared for, with a horrible floor (it looked like concrete with a layer of grey paint on it). But worst of all was probably the noise - the noise insultation is almost zero and I had a room next to the linen closet. Between that door banging shut, other room doors and sounds from the floor above I really don't think I slept more than an hour or two.Location-wise it's within easy walking of Paddington Station, but not as close as I was expecting.There are worse hotels than this and if you can get it for 25 and are a sound sleeper it might be worth it. But any more than 25 and it starts to feel very overpriced very quickly."
4,709,"Oct 19 2009	Tiny but perfect if you just need a bed for the night	Stayed two nights in a small ground floor double room, no window, with my 5 y.o. son while we were sightseeing in London.Is ideally positioned 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station so is great for either linking with the Heathrow Express or using the Underground to get around town. Plenty of food choices around, nothing fancy but youll get a satisfying feed (The Exchange near the local Laundromat is a kid friendly pub with good hospitality, and the food is tasty and cheap) Sainsburys and M&amp;S have express stores at the train station so you can get the basics at reasonable pricesCheck in process went without a hitch, and they even let us check in early without charging us extra. Reception is manned 24 hours and everyone we dealt with on there was friendly and tried to be helpful, including booking us hire car for our early departure.Now to the room. I knew it was going to be small, website has dimensions etc but was still taken aback at the lack of usable floor space for bags and moving around. Effectively good sized double bed surrounded by the walls on three sides with a little built in bedside table. My carry -on luggage took all the little bit of floor by the bedside table. That leaves the area between the door, bathroom and bed. About 6 feet long by two and bit feet wide my big case used most of that. I expected a small room, had read the reviews and basically its exactly what I thought itd be. If you dont mind stepping over your luggage you wont find it a problem.Bathroom tiny like onboard a ship, but very clean and functional. Must say bed was really comfortable too.Room has small LCD TV (you pay to get the remote which is worthwhile) and we had an air con unit so could control temp really well. Wi-Fi available and vending machines in receptionId stay here again  cheap, clean and good location. Not everyones cup of tea, but if all you need is a bed easyHotel is perfect"
5,709,"Oct 13 2009 	Cheap good location no frills whatsoever	This hotel knows its audience. In a city of VERY expensive hotels, the easyHotel is filling a void. The rooms are TINY but the website says as much, and there's no way in a city like London that you're going to spend any time in the hotel room anyway. Our room had its own bathroom - big plus - and a window. &quot;No window&quot; is an option but I wouldn't recommend it; that'd be like sleeping in a stuffy shoebox!One caution though...the shower doesn't have a &quot;lip&quot; on the bottom to catch water. I nearly flooded our entire hotel room! Don't use the shower full blast.The easyHotel Paddington is a five-minute walk from Paddington Station where you can catch regional trains (i.e. to Windor Castle) or the Tube to central London and all the touristy sites. London's tube is just the best public transportation system I've ever seen, so you don't even need to worry about the fact that this hotel isn't right in the middle of the action. It's surrounded by cheap little restaurants and pubs, too, so there's plenty of food options.I would stay here again. It was perfect for a couple of backpackers who wanted to experience London without going broke."
6,709,"Aug 30 2009 	Depends what you're after.	OK - first thing first, my 'real' score for this place is 2.5! I felt a 2 would be unfair, so I've had to bump it up to a somewhat generous 3. It's really a 50/50 call on this place and it depends of course on what your plans are and what you're looking for in your stay.Yes the hotel is quite close to Paddington - just a few minutes walk.Yes they will charge you to store luggage, but you probably know that already.Sure you will pay extra for a TV remote control, more towels, more pillows etc, but it's not like you'll want to spend much (any?) time in your room, apart from sleeping/showering, so the extra costs are not that bad really - just don't do it hey!Of course the room is small and basic, that's the point. That being said, it's not uncomfortably small - though we did have one of the larger rooms &quot;with window&quot; (overlooking a scuzzy courtyard)! I'm not sure what I would think of the smaller/window-less varieties on offer...What this place has going for it is that it's simple/straightforward to check-in and check-out, the rooms are clean, tidy and secure. These may sound like odd things to be complementing them on, but the amount of reviews you read for 'budget' London hotels where people say the bathrooms were filthy and mouldy, the window/door locks were broken (&quot;I had to sleep with a chair jammed against the door and one eye open.&quot;) etc, and you realise that yes they are very important!So if you're just looking for a bare-bones, but clean and tidy, place to sleep, shower and that's about it, then this could be your place.I notice that a lot of easyHotel critical reviews cite the wide range of &quot;better places for the same money in the area&quot; - but who knows what these places are...if anyone does, please let me know!PS, the room's not THAT orange..."
7,709,Aug 24 2009 	Bed bugs!	I stayed in room 110 for one night and came away with over 100 bed bug bites. Bed bugs are highly mobile and a building can become infested extremely quickly. I informed the management of the hotel so the room could be cleaned and other rooms could be checked for infestation but I have yet to receive a response. Very dissapointing for what is meant to be a world class brand operating in a world class city.
8,709,"Aug 13 2009 	Excellent Hotel and Really value for money	We stayed in this hotel last year in summer and we paid 109 for the same room..... this time we only paid 59 ..Some facilities were missing and there were some extra charges but we are happy and will be coming again in next summer.As before excellent staff, great location and just 20 mins to heathrow airport.We will highly recommend this hotel to everyone for short stay in London as we find this hotel safe and good location with always ready to help staff.."
9,709,"Aug 11 2009 	okay but probably won't return	The best thing that I can say about this hotel would be the location.The con's of this hotel would be the fact that they charge extra for commodities like 5 for a remote per night to watch television, which you could get for free in something like a 3 star hotel. If you were to pay for all the extra things that would come standard in a 3 star hotel it would cost around the same price as one anyway. The only thing you're paying for really is the location, which if your not that fussed on I really wouldn't recommend this hotel. The bathrooms can be a problem as the shower will cause flooding. The window in our room was pretty much broken, and wouldn't open properly. Also found some porn magazines under the mattress, so I would question whether they change the sheets at all. The wall between the corridor and the room is paper thin, so you can hear everything that goes on outside, especially the cleaner at 7 in the morning rumaging around in the cleaning cupboard, talking as loud as they like. The pro's, like I said before, is the location but to be honest it wasn't even worth that, also the reception staff were friendly and quite helpful."
10,709,"Aug 9 2009 	easily the worst hotel in london	I booked a double (with window) here months ago, and paid 55 pounds, mainly because of its proximity to the Heathrow Express. We arrived at about 11.30 pm and were checked into a room in the 'sub-basement.' The subterranean room was too small to fit two people and two small bags, it smelt like a used portaloo (a noxious mixture of chemicals and stale extretea), the 'window', which measured about 1 foot by 2, opened not to the outside, but to the cupboard where the cleaning fluids and dirty laundry are stored (which no doubt added to the noxious and persistent odour of the room). And its lights remained on all night - shining onto our faces.When I complained about the room/window/light/smell, the polite but ineffective receptionist said there was nothing he could do. As it was late, and we had pre-paid, we stayed. There weren't many alternatives. However, it was a terrible experience, and represents a massive and insulting rip-off. I have stayed in a couple of worse hotels, but they were in desperate situations in the third-world, and were a lot cheaper!In all, all I can say is DON'T STAY HERE, even if you are tempted by the convenient location and cheap price! It is not value for money, you may catch something, and you certainly won't have a good night's sleep. There are plenty of small, independent hotels in the area that offer much better value and a more comfortable stay. Indeed, this was such a bad experience, I will even avoid flying EasyJet , despite their attractive prices- I am now a very uneasy customer!"
11,709,"Jul 26 2009 	A single is not a double	Having booked the room long ahead, I got a decent rate; I think it is the best you can get there (GBP35). For a long time I had wanted to try one of these EasyHotels ... and I was very disappointed.OK, I agree, I booked a &quot;small room&quot;. But I wouldn't have expected that this implied a small bett on top. Effectively, the bed we got (even after changing rooms!) was clearly a single bed. Sorry, that's not what I booked.Even worse, on the first morning, we were woken up at 9 by the receptionist knocking at our door, saying &quot;I need to get in this room&quot;. Ten minutes later, the cleaning lady tried to enter the room, again. When we got to the reception half a hour later, we were told that we had to change rooms (again), because they had to do &quot;maintenance works&quot;. We accepted, because she offered us a room with a &quot;real&quot; double bed.Therefore we spent the second night in what was supposed to be top of the notch at EasyHotel. Still very small, no space for your luggage. The bathroom was very small (no problem with that) and I got the impression that the whole will get filthy quite soon.The positive side? As others mentioned, the location, very close to Paddinton station. That's it I guess. Thank you, EasyHotels. That was my first and last time."
12,709,"Jul 23 2009 	Tiny room but very practical and great value	If all you want to do in London is crash on a bed, take a quick shower and enjoy the city, this is the best place. I've stayed in B&amp;Bs in London before and most of them are old looking and quite tacky but quite expensive. Easy Hotel is simple, no beating by the bush: a double bed and a bathroom, that's all you need! Everything was very clean though they didn't clean our room during our stay. The location is very good, 2minutes walk to tube station, 5 min to Hyde Park, reachable by night bus. The main asset of this hotel is its price, 50 per night for 2 people."
13,709,"Jul 8 2009 	They just ignore my complain!	I was booking a No window small room for one night. It state there is a double bed inside the room from the website. However, there is a single bed inside the room when I check in. I try to complain it, but they just ignore me....."
14,709,"Jul 6 2009 	excellent	it was great stay with easy hotel paddington every thing was more than above in terms of customer services, cleaness and service though room was cozy but fine"
15,709,"Jul 4 2009 	Unhappy experience	My trip to London and Paris (4 June  17 June 2009) was first 5 nights at London, then 5 nights at Paris and then the last 3 nights at London again. The accommodation for all the 8 nights at London was booked for EasyHotel, Paddington. Due to rescheduling of my flight, for the last 3 nights, there were 2 bookings, one for the first 2 nights and the other for 1 night. All the 3 bookings (for all the 8 nights) were confirmed and paid before 24/4/2009 on-line. I paid for standard rooms with window for all the 8 nights. According to the website information, the size of the room should be 7.6  11.0 sq. metres, while the cheaper small room is with size of 6.0  7.5 sq. metres. When I arrived at EasyHotel (Paddington) at 10a.m. on 4 June, I asked for a bigger standard room (within the allowable range). The receptionist just told me that all the rooms are the same and gave me Room 109. When I entered the room, I found that there was only a narrow space of less than 2 feet between the 2 edges of the bed and the walls, with the other 2 sides of the bed abutting walls. I wondered what a small room would look like  with all the 4 sides of the bed abutting walls! When I got back to London on 14 June as an old guest, the receptionist was very kind and helpful. He managed to give me a bigger room (Room G1) which I knew is a special needs room and there was no booking for that room for the 3 nights. He gave me the room for the whole 3 nights (14-17 June). He did confirm that the room is for the whole 3 nights and just asked me to inform the reception on the 16 June morning as a courtesy. On 16 June, when I got to the reception at 10 a.m., I saw the receptionist arguing with a couple on the size of their room. She promised the couple to try her best to give them a bigger room and asked them to come back to her after lunch. Then I came to her and told her that I was at Room G1. When she heard that, she immediately told me that I need to change my room because someone else had booked my room. I explained to her the arrangement made by her colleague on 14 June and that I have already been occupying the room. She just rudely said the room is for special needs and her colleague had made a mistake. She then showed me on the computer terminal that no special needs room was available on-line on that day which meant that Room G1 was not available and therefore I needed to get out of the room within an hour. Then I asked her when the double booking was made, whether before or after the time when the room was allocated to me on 14 June morning. She just refused to check it out and insisted that I needed to change my room. I said that it was ridiculous. On 14 June, the receptionist knew that my bookings were for 3 nights and he did confirm that I can keep the same room for all the 3 nights. If I need to change the room, I would not take the room at the very beginning. It was just a nonsense to change the room for just one night. I also pointed out to her that the non-availability of Room G1 that she showed me on-line was misleading, since I have already occupied the room and that was why Room G1 was not available on-line. Then she told me that I could keep the room. Up to that moment, I knew that she was just cheating me all the way that there was a double booking for Room G1. If there was really a special needs booking, she wouldnt let me keep the room at the end. Otherwise, how could she manage to accommodate the special needs guest on that day."
16,709,"Jul 2 2009 	Really Small room ...	I stayed there for my budget. The location is very good. The room (White + orange) is really clean, but the room is soooooooooo small. My room has window, on the 1st floor. It's lucky, coz no escalator, we need not to bring our big luggage up and down its too narrow stair...our room is the first one near the stair, at night when we slept, too noisy I think. No service at all except paying money. The towels, bedsheets didn't changed for 4 nights. The room is so small and it's difficult to place 2 luggages as well. But I wi\ould say that it is really good for single traveller.Apart from these, the staff is nice too."
17,709,"Jun 21 2009 	Its a EASY hotel	the stairs are narrow and echo when a person uses them, if you have a room near the stairway, good luck. The bath was *really* tiny with no place for clothes except on the toilet seat. It was difficult to walk as we had to place our bags on the floor in lieu to tables. The TV could only be seen from one bed and my brother had to move to mine when he wanted to watch the telly. If I had known about the abundance of hotels in the area with similar prices and with free wifi, I would not have booked this hotel. The staff were either always checking their mail or watching vidoes online. When asked for food recommendations in the area there was nothing from the staff. Will be looking at other hotels for my next visit."
18,709,"Jun 19 2009 	Read their cancellation policy.	Read their cancellation policy. If you cancel, they don't refund your money, it stays in your account with them, for 1 year, applicable to other easyHotel bookings you make. There is no furniture other than the bed, the floor is the only other storage location. The bathroom is too small for a tall person, I have to stand outside it to reach the toilet paper. No phone, no water glass, no kleenex, no shower mat, no rugs, no luggage rack, no closet, my bathroom smelled, a train shakes the building during daylight hours, tv is an extra cost, and the miniature bathroom sink was slow to drain (couldn't leave the water running), shower curtain didn't keep the water from getting out. Wouldn't stay here again."
19,709,"Jun 15 2009 	Budget Hotel With Poor Service	My girlfriend and I traveled here and spent 5 nights in a room on the third floor with a decent view of London rooftops. Positives: The price tag of the hotel cannot be beat and is really economical. By staying here we were able to save a lot of money. However, due to the size of the room it would be more acceptable for a solo traveler. Our bathroom was also clean which was a nice surprise. Negatives: So small! We read reviews before we left and thought that we could handle it. We couldn't. My girlfriend and I are thin people and we still had problems sleeping on what is really a twin bed. Additionally, if you have a large suitcase it is very unlikely that it will fit in the room. When getting ready in the morning we must have ran into each other over 10 times. Another huge problem that I have with this hotel is the staff. We came early and paid the 5 pounds to leave our bags with the staff. The lady told us to come back after 3 and everything would be ready. We came back at 3:30 and found out that our room would not be ready until 4. Finally, when she told us the room was ready; the maid was still in there cleaning! Also, my girlfriend and I were willing to pay the extra 2 pounds for another pillow only the hotel did not have any! Worse than that, they did not bother to get any extra pillows for the duration of our stay. The comforter on our bed was also severely torn but I suppose that is normal at the easy hotel paddington."
20,709,"Jun 6 2009 	Cannot recommend this place	I've been staying at the easyHotel Paddington for three nights.Cleanliness &amp; Service:Let me start with the worst part: Bed Bugs (which I fortunately spotted in the first night). This is not necessarily a question of how the rooms are cleaned, but the staff at the reception seemed rather unconcerned. I was not offered another room but had to insist on it, and to actually get the room, I had to return early to make sure that not all other rooms were taken. At least the management seems to have taken care of the problem and my second room (on the same floor) was ok.Other than that, both rooms and their bathrooms were reasonably clean, but you have to be aware that rooms are only cleaned when guests change or for an additional fee.Rooms:The rooms themselves provide the absolute minimum you need. It's sufficient for a weekend in the city but not suited for a longer stay. Like their web page says: there are &quot;2 clothes hanging hooks provided&quot;, and there is hardly any room for luggage. There is no shelf or hook in the bathroom to put any toiletries.For the rooms with a window to the street, there's another downside. The hotel is in a sidestreet and there's not much traffic, but there's a noisy bus stop right in front of the hotel. Besides that, the sound insulation between the rooms is also rather bad. Location:The location is pretty good, with Paddington station and the underground around the corner and lots of pubs and affordable restaurants in the area."
21,709,"Jun 5 2009 	Small clean and affordable - much as you would expect it to be	My wife and I stayed for one night and we were somewhat pleasantly surprised. The floor is hard and lacks that comfy hotel room feeling, but you understand why it's like that - easier for the hotel to clean and it's no big deal, there were clean towels on the bed - something we didn't actually expect, there was a TV - something we didn't expect (although a remote would've been handy), there was Dove soap dispensers in the en-suite (more than we expected). We stayed in Lower Ground 3, we had a card entry system on the door handle, the room was tiny, but adequate, there were 2 pegs on the wall that we used to hang our clothes on. There was a window looking out to a small services courtyard (but at least it meant you got some natural light into the room and some venitlation. We travelled light (hand luggage) - we were only in London for 1 night, after going to a wedding and for what we needed, it was perfect. We could've stayed somewhere else cheaper, but there is comfort in knowing that there will be a standard of cleanliness from a brand like those associated with Stellios. Staff were pleasant and business like as you would expect.Good points: clean, affordable, air con, window, TV, en-suite.Bad points: small room, no wardrobe"
22,709,"May 6 2009 	Not so bad... and great location	Just stayed the long weekend at EasyHotel Paddington, and did not find it to be too bad. I was there with my partner, and yes the room was cramped for the 2 of us, but literally we were only there to sleep, after all, in London, who wants to sit in their hotel room?It was adequate for what we needed, clean, and relatively quiet. Staff were friendly, location was excellent in my opinion, very convenient and with good transportation connections. The immediate area has plenty of pubs and restaurants, and it is walking distance to everything if you are feeling energetic, or 10 minutes on a bus or tube train if you are not. Its definitely not a 'memorable' experience to stay here, and not the kind of place you would dream of coming back to, however I would stay there again if I was in London and it was available at a good price. As long as you are not expecting too much, you should not be disappointed."
23,709,"May 4 2009 	Stealios - a rip off	Stopped here for just one night (thank goodness). First the good things. It was clean. The bad things are:-Room was tiny - about 8' x 6'. No wardrobe. Nowhere to put luggage. No soft lights for reading in bed. No tea/coffee making. No shelf to put toilet bag. Painted bright orange and sick colour. Lino on floor.We paid about 70 for the room with no breakfast - FAR too much for this hostel standard accommodation. We left our bags at the hotel as we arrived too early for check in.... and were charged 5!!! The TV remote control even cost 5!!! An extra pillow? 2. A cup of tea or coffee? 1 from the lobby. Towel change? 1 each. Extra blanket? 2. Worst of all, if you want your room cleaned, it's another 10!!!!This hotel is of poor standard, with awful rooms - smaller than a ships worst cabin! The price is a total rip off.... and EVERYTHING costs you extra. We shall never be going back - we'd prefer the comparative luxury of the YMCA to this rubbish hotel.A complete and utter no-no for all but the least discerning travellers who are not averse to being ripped off at every turn.DONT DO IT!Malcolm Freeman"
24,709,"Apr 24 2009 	Disappointing	Having stayed in the great Easyhotel Earl's Court maybe I expected too much. We booked a room with a window and were suprised to be in the lower ground floor, overlooking some sort of tiny, grotty courtyard. The window felt very unsecure with no real lock. Bathroom stunk - there is no ventilation. And noise insulation very poor.Staff nice enough however I definitely wouldn't recommend the lower ground rooms. Not a bad price however there is a lot better value for money in the area."
25,709,"Mar 30 2009 	Too expensive for the low quality offered	I was used to go in this hotel with the previous owner (was called Boulevard hotel) and I always found nice, with small rooms, but nice.This time it was more expensive and the quality was really lower. First of all they made lot of rooms in what they called the &quot;lower ground&quot;, i.e. one level underground (and this is not said in the web reservation system). We got one of these rooms and the windows (feature for what you have to pay!) was open in a 1x1 meter court, with no view of the sky and crowded with air conditioner discharge devices, i.e. noise!The room was very dusty and the sheets had holes in some points. After a night you really run out of oxygen and if you are a bit allergic to dust (as my girlfriend) it is really difficult to sleep there.In the first morning there was also no hot water for the shower.We asked for a different room but we was told that it was the only one available (we booked via internet), even though outside the hotel it was indicated that there were room available. The location is good and the area is nice, but as there are many hotel around, even cheaper, and with real windows, next time I'll book in another hotel."
26,709,"Mar 19 2009 	Good located orange bed factory!	I stayed here because I was attracted to the rates - my company doesn't give a great accomodation allowance these days!I'd read some previous reviews so kind of accepted a basic but clean place to stay. I was pleasantly suprised. The room whilst small, with a window (with a view to a cellar so hardly worth bothering with the extra cost - well, the ledge was useful for storage if nothing else), had everything you need for a place to sleep and shower.I had enough room on my own with one bag, but can imagine that with two people and two bags it may get a bit congested.I did avail of the TV because it is always useful at night - its the first time though I have ever had to pay for TV, although it did have around 30 channels not just the standard 5.The shower seemed to suffer from a hot water famine at peak times so beware in the morning you may get a more invigorating shower than you expect! There is a radiator and an air con machine which suprised me, although I can imagine its probably needed in summer.Easyhotel seems to be attracting a niche market and good luck to them, If you can book ahead and get a bargain rate and don't mind small space then you will have no problems."
27,709,"Mar 8 2009 	I loved it! Favorite place to stay in London.	I booked a standard sized room with a window (3rd floor) and it cost me 192pounds for 4 nights. Thats super cheap and although you could find other hotels as cheap in London none would be as clean or safe as easyhotel was.The rooms ARE small. I stayed in the room with my wife and we had 2 large bags with lots of winter clothes for 5 days plus we did a lot of shopping and i dont think we would have had room to store anything else if we had stayed 2 days longer.BUT, we did stay there for 5 days and it was an excellent experience. When we travel to London we dont spend time in the room. We wake up around 8 and are out by 9. We then spend all day shopping and walking. We get back to the room around 10. Watch some tv and fall asleep by 11. So the money we saved on the hotel we spent shopping.The location of the hotel is really great. Its 2 minutes from Paddington station and there is a major bus stop right in front of the hotel. Most of the buses on oxford street drop you off right in front of the hotel.One cool thing I learned from the easyhotel employees was heathrow connect. Its like heathrow express just a lot cheaper and instead of taking 20 minutes to get to the airport takes around 30 because it has a few stops on the way. Take the heathrow connect so save some more cash.There is wifi in the room i think it was 20pounds for the week. Lots of cool tv stations to watch also. Cheap fast food joins are also near the hotel like KFC, Burger King and McDonalds.I would definitely stay at easyhotel paddington again. Note: Stairs are small so carrying to large pretty empty bags up to the third floor wasnt a problem but coming back down when fully packed and each twice as heavy was. Tip, bring the bags down one by one!"
28,709,"Feb 25 2009 	clean well-situated short-term human storage	I agree with the reviews below, and want to emphasize how very basic this place is. Aesthetically, it has more in common with a series of storage lockers than any hotel you've seen. The floor in the room is painted concrete. The plastic shower stall is fine, but the sink is so small that if you open the tap too much, water sloshes right onto the floor. No lamps (just basic ceiling and wall lights), no tables, no desk, no dresser, no curtains (roll-up shade), no simulated oil painting of a vase of flowers. If you're not depressed by a tiny, sterile space and you value cleanliness and low cost, go for it. It was a great fit for my needs: after staying in a fancy hotel with my travel companion, I needed something central and cheap for one night by myself before leaving London the next morning. I checked in at 6pm (needn't have paid extra for a window, since it was dark already, went out for dinner and a walk, had a comfortable night's sleep and was out by 8am."
29,709,"Feb 12 2009 	place was bad but staff were good!	Oh dear, what can I say? You get what you pay for. Our flight out of London was cancelled due to the snowstorm, so we had to put up somewhere for the night. For that we chose the easyhotel Paddington because it had cheap rooms (39 pounds) at the eleventh hour. Location wise it's not too bad. Only a five-minute walk from the Paddington tube station. Convenient if you're taking the Heathrow Express...but if you're paying so much dough to take the Heathrow express, you wouldn't be staying in the easyhotel would you???We had a standard room with a window and ensuite. It was small enough! I can't imagine what the normal rooms without windows were like. the bed was more of a supersingle rather than a double. Bathroom looked fine, of course it was small too, except that there was some mould? algae? fungus? growing on the shower head. The next morning when we tried to shower, there was absolutely no hot water. A dilemma, because it was 9.15am and check-out time is 10am. They sent a man up to check and after a while they told us there was a problem with the pump, so we were given keys to another room in order to use the shower there. We also had our check-in time extended to 1pm. That was handy!Quite an experience, I should say, staying in the easyhotel. I don't think I'd ever stay in an easyhotel again, unless I was in the same predicament (flight cancelled) I was in. I guess for a night or two it's fine, but if you stay there a week you would go mad! We had a good experience with the staff. There's only one recetionist on duty at a time, I felt sorry for the one who was bogged with a huge group of spanish tourists as I was walking out. But all the staff I dealt with were nice and accommodating and were willing to help.For the price I paid, I would say it is decent. But I wouldn't stay there again if I could help it! Yes, I'd recommend it to a friend loking for no-frills accommodation for a few days and is on a very tight budget!"
30,709,"Jan 22 2009 	Moderate value for money accomodation	I traveled to London on my own between 12-16 January 2009.I have been there many times and tried different types of hotels and b&amp;b's.This time I chose Easyhotel Paddington,because of the very good price (35 GBP per night single room with window)I found on their site three months before and the good reviews I read at Tripadvisor.I arrived at 11.30 pm and the reception man gave me room LG10 (lower ground).At frst site, I was a bit shocked about the really small size of the room. The bed was of a good size, but the rest was almost nothing!!.No space to place anything but on the floor taking care not to step on your bags, shoes,etc.There was a window looking at the narrow corridor of room LG11!! So, it was as if there was no window at all!According to my mind,window is a square opening looking OUTSIDE no matter the view!!!The toilet-shower room was tiny but that worked well wih me.The room,bed, linen shower was clean.There was no noise coming from the hotel ,road but after 6 am and until 12.00 you could feel and hear the underground train passing every 4-5 minutes and if you are not used to that, you will feel annoyed!There was a LCD tv that you have to pay 5 pounds/day toget the remote from reception. If you stay three whole days as I did, you can not avoid staying in that hole without watching a bit of tv. Beware there is no 220 V socket in the room, youhato ask for an addaptor at the reception!Because I love spending almost the whole day out, doing things and coming only exhausted to rest, I did not suffer and itme passed so quickly (I lOVE LONDON) but if you are not a walking person and need more relaxation on your hotel,forget it!!!! Receptionists were polite and helpfulOverall Easyhotel was a good value for the money I spent, but not a welcoming relaxing hotel at all!!!!"
31,709,"Jan 14 2009 	Good budget hotel in London	Stayed at this hotel twice in early January, and tried two different type of rooms.The first time I stayed, I tried the small-size room with no window. The rooms at this Easyhotel were always spotlessly clean. However the small rooms are exactly that - SMALL. Do not book into this type of room if you have more than a small backpack, as there is simply no space to put anything...you cannot even stand and keep your arms outstretched, because the room is very very small. However, it is a good option if what you're after is a bed and a shower. The shower/toilet is a small plastic unit, and the shower was powerful and worked well. Not having a window might put some people off - at least, however, there is an air conditioning unit.The second time, I tried a standard-sized room. This type of room affords more breathing space than a small room, and I had a window, which was welcome. The bathroom was ok, bigger than in the small rooms, but I had the same experience as others on here in that I could not get the shower to work - I could only get cold water. The bed was good.On the down side, the whole hotel is very orange and very branded - you will find the 'Easyhotel' logo on the windows, the walls, etc. The rooms are small. The shower only worked well one night. On the up side, the desk staff are very helpful and friendly, and you can check in at all times after 3pm. And also, don't forget that for this price, you cannot get a clean hotel/hostel room anywhere in London which is ensuite - at this price, in London you'd be expecting dirt and bedbugs, so a small room is a small price to pay for a clean room of a consistent standard."
32,709,"Jan 6 2009	Budget hotel - don't expect much	I stayed over 1 night at Easyhotel Paddington (X'Mas eve). I chose this hotel because of the location and my budget. The room is very small and need to pay extra for other services e.g. TV, towel, cleaning service. However, it was very cheap when compare with other hotels so it was good for young tourists and backpackers. No lift available in this hotel.... Extra comments, If you haven't been in London during X'Mas, please be aware of transportation on X'Mas day (25th Dec). No train and bus runing on that day. However, there was a coach replacement to the airport on that day at Paddington St. And that's the reason why I chose this hotel..only 5 mins walk to Paddington station. Be wise and proper planning before traveling"
33,709,"Jan 1 2009 	Cheap and clean	EasyHotel in Paddington was a good base for exploring London as it was very close to Paddington Station (about 3 minute walk). Extremely convenient for us as we caught the Heathrow Express into the city (which terminates at Paddington Station). Thus a very good location. Rooms were quiet, very clean and warm, but very small as expected. The corridors were incredibly narrow and there was no elevator so you must carry your luggage up the stairs. Staff were friendly and helpful.It would have been useful to have some sort of table in the room, even just a bedside table, as there was none so everything had to go on the floor. Couldn't get our shower to work properly even after asking staff so we had lukewarm (that became cold!) showers, which wasn't very nice in London winter!Otherwise though a great location and very clean room for the price, which was good for us on a tight budget."
34,709,"Dec 29 2008 	Good base don't expect too much!	As with the airline, I was expecting cheap and (not always) so cheerful, in this respect it did everything I needed. I have noted that the prices are at least 10 a night more than when I booked a few months ago and this does start putting it into a category with more budget competition.Also note that everything 'extra' is chargeable. This didn't matter to me, but if you did arrive early (15.00 check in), then you have to pay if you want to leave your bag there (5 for 2 bags), and have your room serviced (10). Again, this wasn't a concern of mine but I noticed some guests that were checking in at the same time as me had paid over double what I had, and factoring these 'extras' in would put the room in the same price range as some 3-4 star hotels I have managed to pick up previously. The room was tiny as expected- there was some room noise from next door &amp; the air con didn't work as previously mentioned.I did have a 'proper' window though- note as in London there is a noisy road outside with a night bus route (central London!). I do feel in the summer though that you may have to choose between stuffiness or having the window open &amp; not sleeping due to noiseThe shower was good &amp; the bed surprisingly comfortable, and for the right price, as much as you can expect in London (in fact, probably at the top end of this price bracket)The location is also good- opposite paddington, close to pubs, eating places, bus route (including night bus) and actually is walking distance to oxford street etcFinally, would recommend an exceptional pub that I discovered- The Victoria (10a Strathearn Place W2 2NH). About a 5 minute walk &amp; the food &amp; beer was fab!"
35,709,"Dec 28 2008 	Definitely some budget trickery here	I'm quite familiar with budget hotels, and my expectations are usually quite low for them... but easyHotel still left me a little shocked. Overall, not a bad stay, but there was definitely more nickel-and-diming than I'd seen anywhere in ages. I booked a small room &quot;with window,&quot; and since I was arriving around 10 a.m. on Christmas Day, I inquired about checking in earlier than the usual check-in time, by e-mailing the hotel. I was told that I'd have to book the previous night (Christmas Eve) in order to check in that early. First, that turned out to be untrue (the hotel offered early check-in for only 10 GBP). Second, even though I did pay 24 GBP to book that room for the Christmas Eve, once I turned up at the hotel, the front-desk clerk tried to tell me that since I'd arrived after 10 a.m. (check-OUT time for the night before), my reservation was worthless. Sound confusing? Quite. I pulled out the printed version of the e-mail telling me exactly the opposite, and started to explain, and he immediately did an about-face and said that, fine, I could indeed check in. I was given a room on the &quot;lower ground floor,&quot; which was, of course, a basement. I made my way down the stairs and opened the door. I wasn't put off by the tiny space, but I was quite appalled (as the last reviewer was) that the room &quot;with window&quot; actually had a window that had a lovely view of the hallway. As the room was uncomfortably warm, and the a/c didn't seem to work, I went back upstairs and asked if perhaps they had any rooms with windows to the outside world. I was told that for 10 GBP a night, I could &quot;upgrade&quot; to a bigger room with a real window. I knew I wouldn't sleep in the heat, so I splurged and got a room on the third floor. It was fine. Again, the a/c didn't cool the room, but the window wide open (there were no pesky restrictions on that, thankfully) cooled things down nicely. In early mornings, it was far too loud to sleep with the window open, however. Speaking of loud, the walls were thick enough to not hear into my neighbors' room, but the doors were incredibly thin and let in even the softest noise, day and night, from the hallway. When doors slammed (as they did quite often), the sound boomed through the room. The bathroom boasted a terrible smell for my entire stay, despite it appearing very clean. Think there must be some sewer problems. The tiny sink didn't drain very quickly, and that it stuck out all of eight inches from the wall, it was virtually impossible to wash your face (given the lack of a washcloth) without getting water all over the floor. The room was indeed small, but I was only one person and only had one piece of luggage. What was more than a little aggravating was that there was not a SINGLE flat surface anywhere in the room. Not a shelf on the wall, side table, nothing. So I was always stepping over piles of things on the floor trying to get ready in the morning. I actually used the outside windowsill to store spare change, etc. The room was clean but not spotless. There were some stray hairs on the comforter that led me to believe it doesn't get washed between every stay, more like shaken out... Oddly, someone &quot;cleaned&quot; the room after I'd been there one of my three nights, even though I didn't order this extra service. But there was a fresh towel and the trash was emptied. I'm staying in a Travelodge in Manchester as I write this -- another very basic bargain chain. And though I've only paid half the price of the easyHotel, it's far, far superior. So, I'm all for budget hotels, but the easyHotel really isn't much better than a hostel in my book. The capsule-hotel thing can be done well (see the Yotels), or it can be done shabbily. EasyHotel's definitely the latter."
36,709,"Dec 21 2008 	When is a window not a window?	... answer: When it's in an Easyhotel room! Apparently if it opens, it's a window - even if it only opens into a basement storeroom - and it's still worth charging extra for!Other than the disappointment of the window to nowhere, the hotel was exactly what was needed, a comfortable bed, in a clean room, close to central London at very good value.So, would definitely recommend this hotel for value and location, but I wouldn't bother with the extra cost for a room with a window, and don't expect a large room. The double bed touched three walls, but then after a night out in London, at least you're not likely to fall out!"
37,709,"Nov 24 2008 	Cheap and cheerful - you get what you pay for!	My partner and I wanted a cheap place to stay in London for 7 days and came across Easyhotel at Paddington. Had a look at the website, knew what to expect and was happy with the price I paid.First impressions of the hotel were great, the hotel staff were very very friendly and offered us maps of london along with other advice. However, we started to stuggle with our bags going up the narrow stars to our 3rd floor room! A lift would have been great but then again we were in a budget hotel! Stelios would have had to pay more for that and he doesn't like spending money on most things! Hence why he is a millionaire!Anyway, got to our Standard Room with a Window and was immediately dissapointed. While I knew that the room was going to be small and missing some &quot;luxury&quot; items, I didn't expect this! The room had hardly any space whatso ever. It was more like 6 foot across with a 5ft bed! We had 4 small bags which took up most of the floor space. This was going to be an uncomfortable stay...!Ignoring that the room was smaller then I thought, it was OK to sleep, stay, watch telly (at an extra cost of course).The shower was THE MOST POWERFUL I have ever experienced. however, I suspect it was a power saving one by which i mean it would be hot one minute but for a split second, just after the starting hum of a motor, it would go cold... instantly! but it did quickly go hot again.The Bed was great though my other half complained about a sore back. Remember any extra pillows cost extra. The size of the room issue did get out of hand when we were walking all over our stuff on the floor and getting ready to go on a night out.... just forget it if there are two of you. Just do it one at time to avoid any problems like knocking and hitting the other person and asking kindly to pass each other in the tiny tiny room.Overall its an ok hotel. I've been in better. Major issue with the size even though I know it would be small. You get what you pay for, its fine for a day or two. but if you are going for more than that with someone else.... forget it!"
38,709,"Nov 21 2008 	You get what you pay for.....and that's all we needed	Ok. It's very ORANGE!!!We had two fast days and nights in London, and we just wanted somewhere to dump our bags and run around like crazy tourists! The bed was a little on the small side, but for two nights, you make do.The room is small, the bathroom is tiny, the hallways are small, everything is small. BUT for 25GBP, you can't expect anymore.We would stay there agin, but only for a couple of nights, and only if you have a backpack. Suitcases would be toolarge for this place."
39,709,"Nov 6 2008 	Brilliant budget hotel	My husband and I have just come back from a 2 night stay at this easyhotel and were really impressed.We have stayed at the South Kensington easyhotel on several occasions and whilst we had no complaints,the Paddington hotel is head and shoulders above it.We arrived at 3.10 and was greeted by an extremely pleasant receptionist.Our room wasn't quite ready and he was very apologetic and said there would be a 10 minute wait.My husband then enquired about a tv remote(normally 5 for 24 hours) and the receptionist said that we could have it without charge to make up for the inconvenience of having to wait for our room,which we were more than happy with.We went for a short walk and upon our return our room was ready as promised.We had a standard room and it was more than adequate for our stay.It was spotlessly clean and had both fully adjustable heating and air conditioning.The bed was very comfotable and had crisp white sheets.The bathroom was tiny but served its purpose.The shower was nice and powerful.The hotel is in an excellent location-5 minutes walk from Paddington,15 minutes walk to Hyde Park-and there were plenty of places to eat etc.Every time we entered the hotel we received a pleasant greeting and when we checked out we were thanked and asked if we'd had a pleasant stay.We will definately be going back here-it's affordable,the staff are some of the best hotel staff we've encountered and the rooms are very clean.If you want budget accomodation you can't go far wrong staying here."
40,709,"Nov 3 2008 	Viable budget option in London	EasyHotel Paddington is the Easy Group's newest property in London. For those uninitiated, Easy specializes in bare bones, mass market services that are rather well kept, cheery, and they disclose that you are making a tradeoff from luxury vs. price. Our two night stay was prepaid through the hotel's website. We were greeted by a corteous desk clerk who explained the room and services offered. We had prebooked unit G-7, a larger room on the ground floor that had a window. The window was actually glass louvers more useful for ventilation than actually getting a view. Noise level is moderate, with plumbing, tube, traffic, and evening garbage pickup. The bathroom is about as large as an airplane lavatory. With a curtain instead of a glass door, you'd be wise to remove any article you don't want wet, like toilet paper, out before you shower. All amenities are pay-as-you go; therefore if you want television, replacement towels, and daily maid service, it will add to your bill.PROS: Very convenient location to Paddington Station, a bus stop is across the street from the hotel. The area has numerous restaurants, shops, post office and hospital. Property is new and well maintaned thus far. At 92 GBP for two nights' stay, a great value for money in an area that can charge many times more.CONS: Bare minimal amenities and service. Even when asking for a cab pickup from the front desk staff, did not get an assist. SUMMARY: Great value for money if you know what you are getting into. This is a bare bones establishment appropriate for cost conscious travellers who want a safer and cleaner alternative to hostels, business travellers wanting a place for a short stay, or those wanting a conveniently located home base for a city break. While a night or two here is just fine, anything past two nights here and it would likely become rather uncomfortable."
41,709,"Oct 23 2008 	great value	Excellent hotel.Clean room and beds.Shower and loo that worked.Great location with bus stop opposite.Very friendly receptionist.Brilliant value for money-couldnt fault it.We were upgraded to a twin room which was pretty big compared to the small double that I have stayed in at Easyhotel Earls court.Shower gel and ONE towel each is provided free.No wardrobe or drawers in room-just a coat rack on wall.Overall,if you are looking for a cheap,clean,safe hotel with no frills-this is it."
42,709,"Oct 20 2008 	Great LITTLE hotel	My husband and I, along with some friends of ours, stayed at EasyHotel Paddington for 3 nights. We booked the standard room with a window (as did our friends). We arrived around 1:30pm, and were able to check in early for 15 pounds, which we did since we wanted to nap and freshen up. Check-in is typically 3pm. Our room was, as expected, tiny. However it was big enough to suit our needs, and the bed was very comfortable. The entire hotel was clean and our room was immaculate. We got settled in and then went to visit our friends who were down the hall and around a corner from us. Their room was at least twice the size as ours. I inquired at the desk about the discrepancy and was told that both of our rooms were in the &quot;standard room with window&quot; category. We were on the lower level, and our windows actually opened up to a maintenance hallway, not to the outside. The attendant offered to show me a &quot;small room&quot;, which was somewhat smaller. I was a bit disappointed with the enormous discrepancy in the sizes of our rooms, but that was really about the only thing I was unhappy about. The staff was friendly, however a friend who had called to get in contact with us was treated rather brusquely and told that they would not relay a message to us unless it was an emergency. We booked our rooms fairly close to our travel time, so the price was higher than most of the low low rates people can get at EasyHotel, but it was still cheaper than most other places in central London! I don't know if it is possible, but if you can call the hotel ahead and request room LG1, that is the big room our friends had."
43,709,Oct 17 2008 	Perfect budget hotel	This is one of the best budget hotel I have stayed inAll you need for your stay in the best rates.Room were very clean and cosy as compare to other budget hotel I have stayed in.It took me 20 mins from heathrow to this hotel.
44,709,"Oct 12 2008 	Small orange and cheap	I wanted a cheap two day break in London to catch up on some museums and art galleries. In the past I have used the University Halls of Residence in Camden, but now find the distance to central London too far.Easyhotel have a number of locations scattered aroun London, usually near major train stations. I booked early and paid 29 for a room with no window in the basement. Check in time was 3pm, which seems late considering check out time is 10am. My room was in the basement. It was clean and compact. I was impressed they had managed to get a double bed into a single bedroom! Only one wall and the bathroom door is orange, it is in no way overpowering or a distraction. The bathroom is very compact, and as a large 6 footer I had no real problems using the facilities except it was very easy to nudge the shower handle accidently while using it, causing the water temprature to drop sharply!The room comes equipped with a powerful air-conditioning unit which is required since the room is small and gets warm very quickly. The room also has a TV which you pay extra to use. You also pay extra for clean towels, change of bedding, more soap etc. etc. These added extras are how the Easy-group make their money.I had no problem sleeping since I had been up since 4am, but I was aware of some noise from the reception above, in the corridoors and the slight rumble of the underground.Overall, I would say ideal for a couple of cheap nights in London and I would definitely stay there again when paying myself, though it will be interesting to see how well the hotel is maintained. I have stayed in much worse hotels in London at 4 times the price when travelling on business!"
45,709,"Sep 28 2008 	Great value for money	The hotel had only been open for three days prior to our stay, needless to say it was spotless. The rooms are small (with just one orange wall!) but we got upgraded to a twin room rather than a double which I had booked, which had loads of room. (room 101) Really comfortable bed, with crisp white cotton duvet and pillow case. Yes the bathroom is small but perfectly formed, has ample sized shower, loo and mini sink , with shower gel dispenser attatched to the wall and lovely clean white towells. Great location just five minutes walk to Paddington tube and ten minutes walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. Also a good place to stay if youve got an early flight from Heathrow ,as the Heathrow express only takes 15 minutes from Paddington. I would definitely recomend this hotel as its very good value for money and you know its going to be clean, no nasty surprises."

1,710,May 9 2009 	Good Value	This is not the Ritz but it is extremely convenient. being very near Victoria Station and an easy walk to Buckingham Palace. Breakfast is not included but there are lots of places to choose from close by and 2 of those offer discounts for guests of the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was recently renovated with fresh paint and a new laminate floor. Definitely an excellent value for basic accomodation.
2,710,"Aug 17 2007 	Youth hostel experience-good enough	I was amused at the reviews I have seen on this hotel. There seemed to be mixed reactions. I felt it was nice enough for the type of hotel that it is - namely, a youth hostel type. I found out about it on the youth hostel website. I did think the rates listed were slightly misleading - it listed its cheapest rate as 25 pounds, when I got there they said the only room available was one for three people which cost 48 pounds. Plus there was a 1 pound plus charge for using my checkcard. It was on the 5th floor or a tiny row-house type building so I had to walk up 4 flights of steps. Neverthless it looked nice enough. It apparently is under new management and has been renovated recently - looked like it had a new paint job. For my purposes I think I am just as happy to walk up since I can do it and I feel more secure that way. They had a bathroom on each floor and there were three small rooms on my floor. The other two rooms filled up - I think one of them may have had their own bathroom. The people I saw seemed very nice. The bathroom was small but adequate. However when I took a shower the water was only lukewarm. The great advantage to this is its location - it is on the next block from Victoria Coach Station and a couple of blocks from Victoria Rail Station. As I understand that London is very pricey I suppose it is a good buy considering. All I wanted was a place to spend the night as I was leaving early next morning and for that purpose it was adequate. They did not include breakfast but Victoria Coach station has lots of fast-food type places inside the station-I especially recommend the ham and cheese pasty for 1pound35. Also there is a small grocery store beside the station. If I go to London again I probably will try something else but it is good to keep in mind in case I need an inexpensive place to stay next to the station."
3,710,"Jul 18 2007 	Not a good choice.	This house is now being managed, along with several other houses on Ebury Street, under Belgravia rooms. I posted a review under Collin House on this website that would be applicable to Ebury House, as they are now both managed by the same people. In summary - you don't want to stay here."
4,710,"Mar 30 2007 	Maybe not the worwst hotel I've been in but pretty close	When I booked our twin ensuite room, I spoke on the phone with a very lovely young lady. I had seen the hotel in a guidebook which is usually very reliable, and the price was very good for London. We chose the hotel for the proximity to Victoria Station as we needed to be on the Gatwick Express early in the morning. Neighborhood was lovely (Belgravia) and safe. Short walk (15-20 minutes) to Parliment, London Eye, Westminster. Our problems started when we got to the front door. There was a sign indicating we were to check in next door at the Collin House.I went in to the reception area, where a young man told me I would have to wait as there was someone in front of me. Not a problem. However, I stood for quite some time and he did not acknowledge me again (except to introduce his mother when she came in). He was working on the computer, so I assumed he was checking rooms. I finally asked if I was in the right place to check in. He assumed I was wating to use the guest computer, why I'm not sure. After finally completing the check in process, i mentioned I was looking forward to speaking with the woman who had booked my stay. I was then told the reason we were checking in at the Collin House is that they have bought the Ebury House. We have stayed in London several times, so we are aware of smaller hotels, but this was the worst experience we have had. Beds were terrible, linens scratchy. Entire bathroom was a stall stuck in the corner of the room. You could barely turn around in it. Toilet paper holder broken, so tp sat on shelf behind toilet...almost unreachable. No soap in the sink. No hand towels. Curtains didn't close. Tv didn't work. Air freshener (Glade solid) was empty. Did I mention there was no heat? No way to turn the radiator up/on.I would not recommend this hotel."
5,710,"Feb 7 2007 	Budget but great location	Hotel is cheap (for London), location of the hotel is great &amp; the street quiet. Management is not particulary friendly but they're polite and try to meet your needs. We stayed in a twin ensuite room - the room was budget but OK. Some niggles - like a broken lamp half hanging from the wall, paper thin walls next to the stairs, the toilet had cracks in the rim which had gone green and the tiny plastic ensuite only has enough warm water for one shower. If you can, ask for a double room as I think these are in better condition. The breakfast room is nice but the English breakfast is vegetarian. Overall just be aware this is a budget hotel - you get what you pay for and no more."
6,710,Jan 14 2007 	Sweetest owners ever.. loved our stay	I stayed with 3 other girls in the 4 person en suite bedroom on the first floor. We stayed a total of 7 nights.. and we loved it there. Of course it was a transition from our huge hotel/motel rooms in america.. but we were prepared for how the lodging is in London. I found the room to be super cute.. thebreakfast was filling and in a super cute dining room. What was the biggest highlight I suppose.. was the man and woman who ran the place. They were the sweetest people ever.. helping us with everything we came to them with.. and we came to them with quite a few things.. asking if we could change our reservation from one night to the next.. asking for an alarm clock.. asking him to keep a lookout for my luggage that would be arriving from the airport the next day as it didnt make my connecting flight. So many things we asked.. and they were friendly and accomodating.. very lovely people. I loved the location.. there were two cute places to eat a block away.. the travelers tavern and the Belgravia. The bus station and train station were right down the road.. we got a week long tube pass.. and never had to pay for a taxi or anything...If you visit london.. I would definately recommend staying here :)
7,710,Aug 24 2006 	Wouldn't go back	This place is really basic and not kept up. It wasn't clean. The beds were old and uncomfortable. The breakfast was horrible even within the context of a British hotel breakfast. We tried it once and skipped it the other days. There are plenty of coffee shops around. The location is good (near Victoria Station) and the neighborhood is great. The Ebury Street Wine Bar across the street is really good for dinner.
8,710,"Jul 24 2006 	friendly management good location smallest water closet on earth	Give the prices of London hotels and the horrible exchange rate, this was the best deal we could find in town. The location is excellent, close to victoria station and major buses are all about an 8 minute walk away. The street is very typical London architecture and is in a very safe area. We were able to walk to some major sights in about 20 minutes. The manager was very nice, let us use the phone and helped book tours. The breakfast was good, they'll substitute and are willing to accomadate your tastes.One tip though: if you are over 100 lbs. and you are staying in a room with a private bathroom or water closet, you will have trouble fitting into the bathroom. It is literally about 4ft. x 4ft., when you sit on the toilet your face will be up against the door. Everytime you turn around, you will knock something over. Bottom line, if you can't afford anything better, this is a good deal!"
9,710,"May 13 2006	A Great Place to Stay	Just returned from a week in London and stayed at the Ebury House. This is a nice, budget B&amp;B in a fantastic area of London and on a residential street, so it's fairly quiet at night. We stayed in two different rooms: the first was a twin (2 twins) and the second a double. Both rooms were very small by American standards and the bathrooms were hysterically tiny! (We looked into another room on the second floor that overlooked the back garden, and it was larger as was its bathroom.) But we knew all this before we went and were not surprised. Also, we didn't visit London to sit in our room! We found the beds to be comfortable enough. The breakfast is decidedly NOT gourmet, but it is satisfying: warm and filling. The tea was wonderful. The management is very friendly and helpful. We received a really warm welcome. They try very hard to make everyone's stay as nice as possible. We stayed for seven nights and paid 60 pounds a night, a fabulous price for London! Please remember that this is a small, budget hotel. For the price, it is an exceptional value: decent breakfast, ensuite bathrooms (in some rooms), marvelous location in a quiet area, clean towels and bed made each morning, and a caring and friendly staff. What more could you ask? Overall, we were really pleased and would most definitely stay there again."
10,710,"Jan 11 2006	Great friendly clean place	We stayed at the Ebury House Hotel in June 2005.I booked the B&amp;B via internet, but also phoned them, and had a chat with the person in charge. She was very kind, and we looked forward to our stay.Upon arriving we had to wait 10 min. till our room was ready, but we where perhaps a bit early, so it was ok.The staff was very kind and normal, Im writing normal, because I have read many times in this forum, that sometimes people who work at hotels, seem strange and unwilling, and unable to understand anything :-)Our room was up quite a lot of steps, that was a bit narrow. But thats how most b&amp;bs are in London, so that was expected. It can be difficult to drag all your luggage up, so its not for the less able. Though there also is a room on the ground floor.Anyway the room was nice and clean. The bedding a bit on the old side, which I mainly gathered from the colours of them, that was fashionable a long time ago.But it was all very clean. And so was the rest of the B&amp;B by the way, the hall and the breakfast room. We got fresh towels every day, and a cleaning of the room.The bathroom in our room, was very small. It had zink, toilet and shower. It was all contained in one big plastic room, that had been fitted into the room. Difficult to explain. It was small, but clean and it worked fine. The room had a small tv on the wall, and view out to the street, which was very quiet, even though there is only aprox. 5 min. walk to the Victoria Station. A very safe neighborhood.They will hold your luggage for a few pounds.In the breakfast room there was 5-6 tables. All very clean, and quick service.The breakfast was cerials and eggs, beans, toast, juice, coffee and tea. You could basically get all what you could eat. It was no problem to order extra toast :-)We payed 75 pounds a night for a twin ensuite. But know that you can get it for 65 pounds in the Feb. So maybe the prices vary through the season.So all in all a great experience!"
11,710,"Apr 5 2004	The Ebury House: Nice Hotel and Great Location	We stayed at the Ebury House Hotel at the end of March 2004 for five nights. We had a triple room en suite and had a very pleasureable experience. The hotel is situated in a perfect location close to the Underground and in a very safe neighborhood. The room, as in most European b&amp;bs, was small but very accommodating for our needs (a double bed with a set of bunk beds). A hair dryer was provided, which was nice that we did not have to use electrical adapters. The breakfast was satisfactory. The hotel staff was very courteous and hospitable. We will most definitely stay at the Ebury House again on our next visit."
12,710,"Oct 20 2003	Skip the Ebury House	Ebury House, London Review: We reserved the family room as we were three senior ladies. One of the bunk beds was so bad that all the spare pillows in the room had to be placed on the mattress in order that it was possible to sleep. They did put blankets under the sheets to protect us from the springs on the other two beds. Sleeping on top of the comfortor was an improvement. The wardrobe had one door missing. The night table had a drawer missing and one of the remaining ones front was falling off making it hazardous. When we pointed this out, they did nail it back on. The headboard on the double bed was disgusting--with holes and tears in it--it had been nougahide at one time--a long time ago. The shower door was an accordian type that was coming apart in several places. The toilet roll holder was on by one nail, which kept falling out all the time. We were also not thrilled with the breakfast. Although their ad says eggs plural fried or scrambled. We were only offered one fried egg along with tinned beans, a tinned stewed tomato, tinned mushrooms and a frozen potato something or other that went in the toaster. I notice they mention hot chocolate, but that was never offered either. There was juice, coffee, tea and toast. We did let the management know that we were very disappointed and they did reduce our rate from 95 pounds to 85 per night. The location is great. We did not want to spend our holiday moving around, so stayed on. We did try a b &amp; b one block further on and found they had lovely accommodation for 70 pounds and a full english breakfast. We will keep them in mind if we return."

1,712,"Sep 2 2009 	Excellent location with average services	The hotel is well located within Paddington area with easy access to buses, under ground station and railway station. Plenty of places to eat. Bayswater and Queensway are within walking distance. Hyde Park and the shopping area of Oxford Street are only few miles away."
2,712,"May 17 2009 	Low-priced accommodation - not the fanciest but acceptable	My friend and I needed a place to stay for 3 nights so after checking around the internet, this seem to be economical enough without having a lot of really bad reviews. (So many of the cheaper places just had the worse reviews).We had no problems staying here. It is a great location (for rail, bus or tube) and one can walk to the park easily. We felt safe in the neighborhood. The hotel from the outside and the lobby is nice, well kept and clean. The desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Overall the hotel and our room were quiet.Now it is the general nature of many hotels in Europe . . . that they tend to be a little more frail around the edges than many non Europeans are use too or expect. So a few thing a very picky person might complain about, well I just chalk it up to staying in a building that is at least 100 years old.The room was small and basic with basic furnishing, yes the carpet had seen better day, and a modern window and new door would have done wonder. But in the end, it was more than acceptable given the price we paid. I would not hesitate to stay there again!"
3,712,"May 5 2009 	Basic ok hotel in good situation for budget	The situation was good and the reception worked well. Considering the prices in London, this was a good hotel. Although not everything worked well. There were some dirt around the room, in window courtains and corners etc. The toilet flush didn't work very well, sometime you had to flush many times to make your wastings disappear... The windows were thin and there was some noice from the street. Perhaps a nearby hospital, because there was lots of ambulances going around the area.But as I said, the main accommodation worked and the prices weren't bad."
4,712,"Jan 28 2009 	Lovely stu	On one hand, It was a great hotel, well situated, tube station very close which make thing really easy.On the other hand it was very clean and the stuff was kind and friendly.In conclusion, it was much better than i thought and a really good place to stay for an economic price."
5,712,"Nov 23 2008	bed bugs.	at first the hotel and room seemed fine, it was cheap so we werent expecting much but we're happy with our room which seemed clean. until we both came home covered with bites. bed bug bites can take up to 2 weeks to show so even if it seems fine, do yourself a favour and just avoid the place altogether."
6,712,"Nov 17 2008 	Don't let the bed bugs bite!	We have just returned from a one night stay at Edward Hotel Paddington. When we checked in we were given a room that had quite obviously not been cleaned. The toilet had not been flushed after the previous occupants. There were dirty shampoo wrappers and tissues in the bath, a dirty wet and used towel in the bath tub. The phone wasn't working so we couldnt even call reception to let them know the situation and had to use our mobiles! Once Downstairs our complaints were brushed aside instead we were offered to joing the hotels priority club! We were given a new room which on the face of it looked marginally better. Until the next morning of course when we woke up scratching ! We had been bitten by bed bugs! We stupidly ignored the reviews we had read about this Hotel, and I am now paying for it as i scratch feverishly. Again after checking out our concerns were just brushed aside. I would advise any visitor to really think twice and really weigh out the pros and cons before choosing this hotel. The only good thing is the Location. I will not be returning to this hotel ever."
7,712,"Jun 8 2008 	Mmmmmmmmind the gap!!	The hotel was an excellent two star one, with private facilities and tea &amp; coffee boiler.. Perfect to stay in for a holiday..Really pleasant!! Truly recommended... :-)"
8,712,"May 6 2008 	where did they get the stars from?	my wife and I booked a theatre trip to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. we booked via lastminute.com and appeared to get a really good deal, theatre tickets for Lord of the Rings and a nights accomadation for less that 100.Unfortunately we had transportation problems and had to find alternative transportation from Leicester to London. On the trip down to London we spent 2 hours trying to get through to the hotel to check what the latest time we could check in. Althought we were supposed to have been able to check in from 14:00 no one answered the phone until 17:00. We had chosen the Edward hotel because of its location and the amenities its claimed to offer. Such as en-suite bathroom, Satelite Tv in Room safe etc. We arrived at the hotel at about 23:30, had to wait for about half an hour whilst the night porter dealt with a group of italian tourists. The problem was, the night porter spoke rather broken english and no Italian. The italians meanwhile could also only speak rather broken English. Eventually we got checked in and headed up to our room. Upon arrival we found our room down a small dingy corridor. The room itself wasn't bad, 2 comfortable beds, which we simply pushed together to make a double bed. Its from this point on we had problems. My wife nipped the bathroom and came running back out, as she'd found what looked like a baby cockroach climbing the walls. I took a quick photo of it with my camera phone and then got rid of it. The amenities that the hotel boasts appear to be destinctly lacking - satelitie TV? you get Sky News and CNN and that's only if someone has remembered to turn the channel on downstairs. The in room safe was superbly secure, i couldn't even find it!!!! So there was no way any burgular was going to. The door didn't have any proper locking device, even the door chain was missing. The hotels only plus point was the free WI-FI available, although all the exposed routers on each floor does pang of a rather DIY approach- but as an IT engineer even i had to admit that it worked. At the end of the day however, if you are looking for a dirt cheap hotel in which to get a bit of kip then you could do worse, i know i have in the past, however if you want my adivce and can stretch to the extra cost then i'd stay in a travel lodge or similar, at the end of the day at least with them you know what you're paying for."
9,712,"Feb 16 2008 	Some where to lay your head for the Night	We (me, hubby + daughter 12) stayed here one night in Feb '08. I paid 76 (through ASDA Travel) which included a full cooked breakfast.The room was very small, one double + one single bed, with a Small gap between the two. A double wardrobe. One shelf/ dressing table which had all the tea and coffee stuff and no where for me to place my makeup etc!The bathroom was ok, - basic. Room was clean and tidy.Basically the room served a purpose for us to use as a base and lay our heads after a night out at the west end. Don't think I could have stayed there long than the one night, due to the lack of comforts being squashed in the room and no luxuries of a hotel break.The staff on reception were polite but not overly friendly or much interaction.The breakfast was ok, I've had better for less money. The dining room was bland, no atmosphere, annoying music!!Location was the best and only reason we booked, close to hyde park and Paddington station, a tube ride to anywhere!Only use this hotel as a B/B, a cheap base to a trip to see the sights of London."
10,712,"Jan 19 2008 	great location and thats about it!	We chose this hotel for the location, and in this respect it did not disapoint. It was a comfortable walk from the hotel to Oxford street and other attractions in that vicinity.Other than that, it was only just worth the money paid. The staff at the front desk were indifferent to guests, and actually seemed quite surprised that an English person would want to stay there. The rooms were small and very shabby. The scratchy blankets looked as though they had been there for decades. The breakfast was okay, but certainly not worth the price charged.Basically, stay here if you want to spend time in central London without breaking the bank, but if you can afford a little bit more than it would be better to treat yourself."
11,712,"Nov 8 2007 	A Warning Should Come With This Hotel	Myself and my partner booked this Hotel via the interent, the pictures on the site looked reasonable (lets face it - it's not the Ritz) but I was very happy with the pictures on the website and it appeared to be very central to most attractions in London. We arrived at the Hotel prior to the 1pm check-in and would have been very happy to leave our luggage somewhere secure while we had a spot of lunch until we could check-in. UNLUCKY for us this was not the case! The receptionist that greated us virtually reduced us to tears! He threw a key at us for a room to place our bags screaming at us that it was not acceptable to arrive earlier than check-in time. I must admit that I did look at him in a manner that he obviously did not approve of but I have to say I was completely dumfounded. He then went on to ask for the key back - said we could &quot;Do whatever the hell we liked we our bags - but they were not obligated to keep them!&quot; I pondered the situation for a minute then informed him that we would go for some lunch and come back at check-in time. We went, had lunch and arrived back at 1'o clock. The pleasant receptionist had changed his tune when I asked him to write down the name of the manager - he bribed us with telling us in very poor English that he was giving us the nicest room in the Hotel - it was the suite and cost 150 per night but he would give it to us for two nights at no extra charge! I told him I would not accept such a thing as a apology for his behaviour and he insisted..............WELL..........................if this was the nicest room I would seriously HATE to have been staying in any other room in this Hotel.The carpet was sticky and dirty, their was black mould on the shower curtain, their was cigarettes all over the balcony furniture, other peoples hair in the bath and by 8'o'clock on our first evening we noticed we had no warm water or heat in the radiator! The TV looked like it was borrowed from a museum, most of the lights did not work, the walls needed a good lick of paint. It was bitter cold outside and wasn't much better indoors. We approached the same RECEPTIONIST who told us to let the water run for ten minutes! and give the heat about another half an hour and he would call up.................and he did! With a plug in radiator that was broke on two wheels. We froze in a dingy bedroom for two nights with no warm water and gave up trying to rectify the matter.I suffer from Asthma and left this establishment with a Chest Infection from a cold damp grotty room - I spoke to the Manager upon leaving who offered my 20 compensation but no apology! I took that matter one above her and the Group General Manager apologised on behalf of the RECEPTIONIST telling me that the receptionist is used to doing night shift and obvoiusly the daylight had something to do with hs behaviour! And that I should be grateful that he had tried to make amends offering me their suite! AND that I had already paid a really cheap rate for the hotel. (70 PER ROOM PER NIGHT)!The Group Manager of course denied that the heat or the hot water were both on the blink and it's very easy to deny now that we are back in Northern Ireland.He proposes that when we next require accomodation in London if he has suitable accomodation available we can have a room with his compliments.................well over my dead body.I find it dispicable that establishments like this are allowed to continue operation. 2 star's is far too many for this Hotel and for 70 a night - I have stayed in better Hostels. I think Bed and Breakfast would be a better title for this place although I'm not sure about that either maybe HELL or something I don't know."
12,712,"Oct 29 2007 	Great for the Money	Booked this hotel as part of a theatre package through lastminute.com. At 90GBP for two show tickets and a twin room for a one night mid-week break it was a bargain. After reading some of the previous reviews I was somewhat sceptical but I needn't have been. Chap at check-in was a little unfriendly, don't expect any polite conversation! The room, however, was a pleasant surprise. We had a twin on the 4th floor that, whilst being comically small (wouldn't liked to have stayed more than a couple of nights in such close quarters!) was clean, comfortable and adequately equipped, far better than I was expecting for a budget 2* hotel. TV with remote, Safe, tea/coffee making facilities, windows that actually open and a perfectly good ensuite. Even though our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the road, traffic noise certainly wasn't a problem, nor were we disturbed by any &quot;hotel&quot; noise. And being only minutes from Paddington tube station we will definitely be staying again."
13,712,"Sep 28 2007	YUCK.......Bedbugs!!!!!	Took two nights to realise that we were being bitten alive! We checked under the mattress and found a heap of bugs. We later found a mature female bug (the worst kind that lays up to 10-20 eggs a night) was feasting on our luggage!!! We went and spoke to reception and they moved us into a new room. I had my doubts but tried it anyway. When we got there, again....bugs under the mattress. We complained again and were upgraded to a room completely separate from the hotel....NO BUGS this time. The reception dude later accused us of bringing the bugs with us....hmmmmm!!!! We had friends arriving later that night and they were shown three rooms in the hotel, 2 of which had bedbugs sitting on the top of the bed as you entered! There was no need to even lift the mattress. Suffice to say, they chose not to stay!"
14,712,"Aug 16 2007 	Wouldnt go back..	At first we got this tiny room with a toilet that didn't flush. Next day they switched us to another one though thank god. Last night coming in to the hotel ( there were three in our party, in a single and double rooms) the receptionist was telling us no visitors are allowed ,which is fine- except we had paid for three and had NO visitors ! Going back to the room we noticed lights were already on and apparently , (eventhough it says in the toilet that if you wish your towels to be changed they should be put on the floor) they don't bring new ones in. Had to go to reception to ask for more and they refused to give us more than one per room. (?!)Working in a hotel myself I found the customer service of the night porter very bad."
15,712,"Jun 4 2007 	Filthiest room in years of traveling	I've stayed in over 25 countries and spent a decade travelling constantly while a naval officer (staying at budget or moderate properties) and this was the dirtiest room I've ever been presented. The stickily stained carpet had not been vacuumed (ever?) and the previous guest's bits of tissue paper, hair, and misc. receipts (in Cyrillic) littered the floor. Water stains on the ceiling and stains of unknown origin on the walls. The door jamb near the latch still showed damage from a long ago prying open. Ground floor window looked out on the bottom of the light well / fire escape, complete with rotting banana peels. One of those nasty Glade deodorizers was installed high on one wall, misting every 30 minutes, giving the room the smell of a service station restroom. Halfway through the night I climbed on the chair to disable it. The bathroom was relatively clean, though, so not a complete horror show. Sheets and pillow case were also clean. I only needed a place near Paddington to overnight for a flight connection, so this place served its purpose, but the neglect (once past the decent lobby) was astounding. With the dollar/pound rate at about 50%, this room cost $110. Cheap for London, but disgustingly overpriced when viewed objectively."
16,712,"May 29 2007 	Basic but great for the $$$$	Just got back from a 3 night stay. The hotel is VERY central to Paddington Station, which was a HUGE Plus for touring around town. Yes, its a basic hotel, but at London Prices, who can complain. We had a triple on the 5th floor. We found that we didn't have water pressure and the moved us right away to the 3rd flr and everything was great! They even offered to move our luggage while we were out, but we did it ourselves. The rooms are basic, clean and fine for a tourist level hotel. Its not the Ritz, but I wasn't paying Ritz rates!! I would recommend the hotel to anyone as long as they knew it was sort of a Motel 6 type room in the US.I will stay there again."
17,712,"Apr 27 2007	Eaten Alive!	While I liked the staff our stay was ruined by bedbugs. Lots of them. I woke up in the middle of the night on our last night there and had four crawling all over me. I've never had this happen before, even in Mexico. Still gives me the creeps. DO NOT STAY THERE. IF A TRAVEL AGENT BOOKED YOU, PAY THE EXTRA CHARGE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. There are numerous budget hotels in London where you will be happier."
18,712,"Mar 28 2007 	Terrible hotel only good quality is location	I'm not even sure where to begin: the arrangement of the room was awful, no remote, had to call twice for them to turn on our phone with broken buttons, internet machine in lobby ate my money, bathroom floor outside the shower was literally black from mold/mildew, faucets were rusty. The whole room and hotel generally felt unclean with subpar service. I dont have the picture of the hallway outside my bedroom but in short it had a rat trap and completely stained carpets. Picture can be sent upon request."
19,712,Mar 18 2007	Budget class but adequate	This hotel is a budget class which means low price and small rooms but don't let this stop you from booking. The staff was helpful and the location was excellent. The showers at peak times lacked hot water and the drain in my room was a problem throughout my 6 night stay. I stayed there with a group of high school students and would book another group there without hesitation. The students got a taste of what most Europeans expect in a hotel room. Breakfast room was bright and most welcoming.
20,712,"Feb 6 2007 	Nice place good price.	Spent one week past spring with my girlfriend. On the first nite, we were given a very small double room on top floor. The bed was a french one and not a conventional double. The room was so small there was no room for our suitcase. A window as small as a 12&quot;. Totally nightmare!On the next day, they moved us to a very nice and clean room on the first floor. We spent the rest of the soujur there. Large room, very nice bathroom, nice view on the street. So be careful for what you get!Nice location, few metres from subway and train station (Paddington).We were told that no breakfast is included when booking thru Expedia or related websites."
21,712,Jan 8 2007 	Don't Let The Bed Bugs Bite!	We arrived at this place and even though it looked older it wasn't bad-at first. The elevator is tiny and the hallway leading to our room was narrow and dark. The room was ok- 4 beds and upstairs/downstairs. When we arrived we tried to take a shower but there was no hot water. The management came up to help us - made the water lukewarm and said we could get a maintnence person 'tomorrow.' While in the bathroom I noticed a couple of small black bugs in the shower. About an hour later my family and I sat around watching tv. We saw a small black bug crawling on the white bedding of one of the beds. It was the same bug seen in the bathroom. When we pulled back the sheets we found 10 bugs crawling around! We immedietly notified the person working at the desk who stated he didn't need to see the bedbugs because he believed us. No apology. Also he did not look surprised! We were so grossed out we left and found another hotel. Until this experience I didn't know bed bugs existed. It was a terrible experience!
22,712,"Dec 27 2006 	UGH!	Booked thru Go-Today travel agency. Knew it was a budget hotel but why the owner of a property with a decent location would let it get so rundown-I do not know! We arrived and are told the lift is broken and will be out for 24 hrs. NO HELP in getting our bags up three STEEP flights of stairs! a 62 yr old man in the lobby said his 85 yr old father could not even walk down much less carry luggage down! No help! next day we were told the lift was out for two weeks! Obviously this was heavy duty planned maintainance that they knew in advance and did not notify the public or their travel agencies. But wait! Our tv was out the first day, they charge for internet but hey it was out! I had a new ac/dc converer that burned out after twenty minutes! The attidude at the desk was so what I won't carry your bags! Why they did not hire a temp to help elderly travellers with their bags is insane. Did not make a dime's adjustment to our bill either. The hotel should have been closed during this time! This hotel makes a motel 6 look like the Ritz! In Oct the room was hot and when you open the windows the traffic noise was horrible. A DUMP! We stayed at a budget hotel in Paris the next three nights-Larger room, quiet , freshly painted, everything worked and the front desk was very helpful."
23,712,"Dec 8 2006 	Great	If you're going to have a late party and live out of town, this is a great little hotel. It's cheap, conveniently situated and the rooms are great value. I shared with a mate after the office christmas party, and it worked out to about 24 - much less than the cost of a taxi at 2am. Go for it - it's warm, the beds are clean and it's just nice knowing you can have a bit of a sleep in instead of commuting the next day."
24,712,"Dec 7 2006 	Room 208 - Room burgaled by hotel staff	I stayed here during my first trip to London in which I had booked no accomodation prior to my visit. On arrival at paddington station it seemed a reasonable hotel from the foyer but little did I know the heartache this place would cause me.On arrival we were told that the room would not be ready and to come back in two hours time, on check in we noticed that the room number 407 had been scored out on the receipt and replaced with 208.The first night went without much problem but the evening of the second night before we went home things started to develop into a nightmare when we arrived at our room to find the exit door next to our room open. When we got inside our window was lying open and several items were stolen including a 60GB Ipod, iM3 Docking Station, 2 psp games and over 500 in cash.Our window was not open when we left so the only way in was from the inside itself, the window and susequently the fire escape were left open as to indicate to us how they got in. This however was no opportunist thief as our passports were left alone in the room on the table in plain sight as well as the fact that they would have covered their tracks a little better.Add to this the fact that the hotel refused to phone the police and you can see that something is not right about his hotel. The hotel have as yet refused to compensate me for this loss and I would advise anyone thinking of staying here to forget about it you will only get robbed if you have expensive items and they see them."
25,712,"Jul 29 2006	Good Location/Not a great room	We chose the Edward Hotel for its location as we knew we would be sightseeing a great deal. However, at the end of a long day of walking one would expect the elevator to work and a cool breeze to be available. There is no air conditioner in this hotel and the only relief comes from sitting out on the window ledge. Bed is extremely small and there is no water pressure in the toilet. Continental breakfast means &quot;pay&quot; a large sum for a very limited breakfast. Staff is not helpful--the best thing about this hotel is its close location to Hyde Park and several Underground routes."
26,712,"Jul 1 2006	Could be good	The foyer was lovely...then you hit the lift.....and you and you get an idea of the rest of the place. A narrow corridor lead to our room, which was tiny but rather cute. No ventilation we thought, and extremely tiny, but we can cope with that at least we have windows right!!!!!!A hint here &quot; CLEAN THE BIRD DROPPINGS OFF THE WINDOWS&quot;. The rooms facing the street may have clean windows..but the windows in the rooms at the back are filthy with bird droppings, we could NOT see out our window at all, so we were not game to open it to get a bit of fresh air.On the other side of things, it is well priced and is staffed by nice people.Also there is everything you need right at hand including a GREAT indian resturant."
27,712,"Jun 23 2006	Never again!	stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. The first single room of my friends smelt so strongly of sewerage she had to get another room. Our room smelt ok, but after a night there we were all bitten by bed bugs, receiveing some nice red bites all over. They moved us and supposedly fumegated the room, but some of our things were missing in the process of the move. Would NEVER stay here again and advise all to stay away no matter how tempting the price! Health inspectors needed here!"
28,712,"Jun 19 2006	A good buy	I was probably lucky because having booked a single room for four nights through hotels.com I was given a two bed room. It was quite a good room and the only complaint I have is TV reception which was sometimes OK, sometimes had OK sound but blurred image and sometimes dropped sound too. I mostly used BBC but sometimes zapped and sometimes found better quality for Sky and some less interesting channels. This came as no surprise having read an earlier review.My room was not towards the street so trafic noise was not a problem. Spring Street is also not a very busy road. The distance to the tube station is not very long.When I booked I did not realize that breakfast was not included but after having read an earlier review I checked the confirm message and it was not stated that breakfast was included. Not a big problem because I could make my own coffee with equipment and instant coffee provided in the room. Last morning I had forgot to buy something to eat for breakfast so I had the continental breakfast for 5. The lady in the breakfast room who checked my room number pointed out that breakfast was not included for me but I told her that I was going to pay for it. The continental breakast is better than at many other hotels, as both yoghurt (with or without fruit), muesli and other cereals, ready to eat grape fruit slices and other kinds of fruit were available.For the price Hotels charged for this hotel, 165 for four nights, it was a very good buy."
29,712,"Jun 15 2006	Relieved - thought it was a great value	I was very worried about the hotel after reading the reviews and tried to change hotels but was having a hard time meeting all our requirements anywhere else. So my husband and I were pleasantly surprised when the rooms were fine: decent size for Europe, cleaned daily, and serviceable. At $80 (including taxes but excluding breakfast ) through expedia, this was a *great* deal for London. (I don't think I'd pay more than $120 for a double, though.) Most of the staff was very friendly, and the night guy, who could be a bit grumpy, was fine with a little patience.BTW, the continental breakfast at 5 pounds was fine, but we liked Luigi's down the street on Spring Street--you could get a decent-sized breakfast for 3.5 pounds or less."
30,712,"Apr 30 2006	Adequate	I was really worried about staying here after reading the reviews on this page, but it turned out to be a perfectly adequate hotel room for how low a price we paid. It was clean, had great plumbing and was in a perfect location. My only real complaint was that the bed was small and hard. I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again, but it was certainly serviceable (sp?) and met our needs."
31,712,Apr 26 2006	A Lot To Be Desired	Although the Edward is not the worst hotel I have ever stayed in (that would be at a Mexican bus stop) it is by no means the best. To start with the Hotels.com website led me to believe that a) breakfast was included and b) that we would have a double room. Our first night was in a twin!! The manager was completely nonreceptive to my complaint stating that &quot;we get that all the time with Expedia bookings look it says twin/double&quot;. Who booked with Expedia I said? I used Hotel.com. He replied that it was Expedia in disguise. Turned out he was right. He was also right about breakfast not being included. The listing in Hotels.com gives the impression breakfast is included a little deceptive I think. Be careful folks!! They switched us to a double the next day. I must say that the double was much better than the twin. The twin had a tiny shower/bathroom with a showerhead that was both filthy and dysfunctional. The water was not really hot and the single bedside table placed between the 2 beds was absolutely filthy. The double was much better. Much better shower and although still a little cramped it wasn't bad.I think only being able to book in at 3PM is insane!!! Although they did take care of our bags while we went for a walk in Hyde park. Zero offer of any help at all with bags. We negotiated a couple of springloaded doors - tricky. The storage cupboard was again filthy. Still what can you do??They did give us complimentary breakfast the next day because I was annoyed however it really wasn't worth getting. The usual continental junk. One of the pleasures of going to Britain is the great breakfasts there. I advise you to not buy b/fast at the Edward. Walk a couple of steps down the road to Luigi's on the same side of the street. It is small but very clean and the full English breakfast is both cheap and delicious. 3.20 pounds for the full monty.Overall I think I would try somewhere else next time especially for the $262 I spent for 3 nights. It is not cheap moneywise but it is in every other sense. They even wanted to charge for the internet computer in the lobby and I bet that elevator has rarely if ever worked. This is a typical Paddington/Bayswater flea-pit that wants to sell itself as something else. I am sure there are much worse but there must to be something a little better also. Good luck!
32,712,"Apr 23 2006	Don't Get off at Paddington Station!	Got to London, which is already double our Canadian dollar, and to spend any amount of GBP on this shanty town was an insult to my wallet. Firstly, the Porter that night greeted us with a cold mumbled hello--I think it was a 'hello.' So up to the room we go, only to find a small utility closet-like room, for 2? Back down to Mr. Friendly where he stalled and beat around the bush when we asked for another room. We booked our stay here in January and our trip was in April, and the Porter was giving us the run-around saying a party of 4 (who booked only 1 month prior to their stay) had precedence over our room selection because they got it at a higher rate. So apparently, online bargaining works against you. After about 5 minutes of wasting our time, he offered to change our room after 1 night spent in the transformed utility closet. Which would be fine if we were there a week, but it was only a 2-night stay. Once we got to the better room, it wasn't anything special--and where did he expect 4 people to sleep in there? It was snug for 2 of us. Finally when we needed a taxi to Heathrow Airport after our 2 nights, we called the Front Desk since it is their line of work to be of service to its clients. 35 GBP to Heathrow--perfect. Now we go out for our last dinner and find a &quot;minicab&quot; company offering the same trip at 25 GBP. They told us the Porter pockets 10 on each clueless tourist they &quot;help.&quot; Never again, keep riding the tube past Paddington!"
33,712,"Jan 19 2006	Laptop and Camera Stolen At Edward Hotel	My VAIO laptop and new digital camera were stolen at this hotel. Three weeks of holiday photographs gone, plus the financial loss. The hotel took no responsibilitythey wouldnt even call the police for me. They probably didnt want the bad publicity. The clerk pointed out the multiple signs that state the hotel was not responsible for any stolen items. Makes me suspicious of why they posted the signs. I walked to the police station and filed a report."
34,712,"Jan 14 2006	Great value for money	I've stayed at The Edward Hotel on two separate occasions, and both times I've enjoyed a really comfortable and pleasant stay. The rooms are clean and spacious with a good sized bathrooms (some with baths). Staff are friendly, and the continental breakfast comprised fresh fruit, fruit salad, croissants, cakes, cereal, juices, to name a few.After reading some of the other reviews posted here, I'm convinced that the reviewers are getting this hotel mixed up with a hotel of a similar name situated in Victoria. This is one of the best budget hotels I've visited."
35,712,"Sep 8 2005	Wouldn't stay here again if you paid me!	I was going to a concert in Hyde Park so chose this as a cheap hotel nearby, we would be getting in late and only staying for 6/7 hours. When we arrived the staff were quite ignorant, we had to stand for quite a while waiting to be served and the receptionist never once said she wouldn't be long or apologised for the delay. Bad service you can live with but the hotel itself you couldn't. It had no lift up a thin and fairly dangerous staircase (carpet had tears in it - trip hazard), the room was disgustingly dirty, there was green mould on the bathrooms walls where there was really bad dampness, the smell was unbearable. It was also tiny - felt dirtier after having a wash - didn't even attempt to shower in it. The bedroom had very basic furniture with an uncomfortable bed and decor in a state. The wallpaper had bits missing and the carpet was covered in stains. I am unsure as to how the hotel had not been closed down by health inspectors and would never ever stay here again, under ANY circumstances. Thankfully I was only there a few hours and that was bad enough!"
36,712,"Jul 12 2005	Check around first - but very nice staff!	The Edward Hotel has one thing in it's favour (and even that is a drawback late at night)- the location. It is literally right beside the Victoria bus station, the Victoria Train station and the Underground. It is very central - but don't pay alot! The rooms are TINY and are all smoking rooms. The sheets, though clean, still smell like cigarettes. It seemed to me that each person staying there had paid a different price and that the prices are negotiable for some reason. The staff are very friendly and are service oriented and hard working. The breakfast consisted of cereal, toast, yogurt and hot beverages and juice. The rooms were very noisy with the trains running right beside you on the left and the underground right below you. Would I stay again? Probably not, there are tons of B&amp;B's in that area - I would check them out and see the differnce first. Rating? Maybe a 5 out of 10. I paid 43.00 pounds per night - I think it was too much for what you get!"
37,712,"Apr 3 2005	Just fine	I have just returned from London where I stayed at the Edward hotel. Before leaving I didn't know what to expect having read other reviews posted here. For an inexpensive two star hotel it was just fine. The rooms were small but clean. Fresh sheets and towels everyday. Everything in the room worked fine. The staff was friendly and helpful. There was an all you can eat breakfast that included fresh fruit, cereal, juices. croissants and the like. Everything you might want is in the nieghborhood. The Paddington tube station was just around the corner. The hotels' location is great, near Hyde Park. I had a very nice stay. For an inexpensive hotel it was just fine."
38,712,"Jan 25 2005	Basic 2* hotel	Having just returned from this hotel (one night stop), I had to review it. This is a two star hotel, the location was great, it was clean, the room had the usual amenities including beverage tray. I paid 40GBP for a double room with a continental breakfast and was very happy."
39,712,Jan 2 2005	Gouge your eyes out with a fork before you stay here	Whoever said this hotel is clean was drinking waaay too much mead at the pub and bashed their head on the toilet. It is nasty and that's being generous. The carpet in our room was filthy and coming apart from the wall. The room radiator didn't work and there was no heat in the bathroom--in December! Hotel staff is discourteous and uncaring. We waited for mail and phone messages that were never given to us! The only compliment I can give this hotel is that the wake-up call actually worked on the morning I left. I can't say it enough--Stay away from this establishment.

1,714,A reasonably Priced Hotel for its Central Location.	The location of this hotel is ideal for those who are planning a shopping holiday. it a about one minute away from Oxford Street. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the whole place has a welcoming feeling. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly. I will certainly be using this hotel in the future.
2,714,"Nov 13 2009 	Average	On the plus side, the Eddward Lear Hotel is near Marble Arch tube station (beside Oxford Street) and the staff are fantastic. Breakfast was nice too - good selection of cereals and the fry was pretty good too. The hotel is a bit dated and there is no lift so that was a bit of a chore for us on the top (6th) floor. London is still pretty expensive for hotel accommodation so this place is near the top of the budget end but still a bit dated. Slightly less than what you would expect for the price."
3,714,"Nov 9 2009 	Its not the Hiton but its perfect for a relaxing break.	The Edward Lear hotel is hidden away just off from the Marble Arch. The outside was nicely presented with flower baskets and the inside was decorated with pictures and poems (from Edward Lear himself). Although the decor was dated it was warming and homely. The staff were brilliant. Receptionist was always polite and spoke with a smile as were the cleaners/maids. You could also book tickets for certain attractions at a slightly discounted price which is always a bonus. Our room was small but very cosy. Bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space for clothes to be stored. Bathroom (en suite) was clean and again small but cosy. Clean towels and beds made every day. The breakfast room could off been slightly bigger. I'd imagine during the busy periods it would be a bit of a squeeze to fit all the quests in. Breakfast choice was good...cereal, toast and cooked available. Cooked being eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, and tomatoes....sadly no fried bread, with a selection of juices and hot drinks. Although close to the main streets it was surprisingly quite at night so a good nights sleep was no problem. As far as transport goes the marble arch tube station and main bus stops are no more than 10minutes walk from the hotel. We personally got buses to London Zoo, Madame Tussard's and the Natural History Museum and with Hyde Park within 10minutes walk the hotel is perfectly placed for site-seeing. For those slightly out of the way places there are several taxi ranks nearby and the taxis themselves are more reasonable than you might think. It cost us 12 to get to the Lyceum theatre which was about 20minutes drive (with the traffic). Eating out is an easy task as well with an assortment of eateries from KFC to Weatherspoons to Italian Restaurants, simply take your pick. All in all the Edward Lear is a brilliant little hotel and excellent value for money...its not the Hiton but its perfect for a relaxing break."
4,714,"Oct 29 2009 	Second time there	I have been once with my family in a family room and now with my husband. Very good small hotel in a great location. Near to everything : Marble Arch tube station, shops at Oxford Street, Hyde Park, touristic bus stop. And breakfast is included."
5,714,Sep 30 2009	Feel Disapointed	Well I tried to book the Edward Lear hotel for a theatre trip for our anniversary but unfortunately we will have to go somewhere else as they dont take one night bookings for saturdays. This is a bit sad as my mother-in-law had stayed and said it was a nice hotel
6,714,"Sep 3 2009 	Affordable and well-situated but tiny	Friendly staff, clean room and excellent location, but we were on the top floor, four stories up with no elevator/lift, in a tiny room: we couldn't open the bathroom door more than 1/3 of the way without hitting the bed. The stairways on the upper levels are very narrow, and on my way down our first evening, I opened a door in between the upper floors with too much strength and banged my knuckles on an angled ceiling that was at the same height as the door knob! It took me completely by surprise and one of my knuckles still aches when I bend it. The breakfast room was also tiny and often required a wait. We could have stayed at the Hilton in Kensington for the same price and went to this hotel for its &quot;character&quot; based on positive reviews here, in Lonely Planet and Frommers. It was our 10th anniversary and first trip to London together. If price and cleanliness are your main concerns, the this place is fine, but we wouldn't go back."
7,714,Sep 2 2009 	The Edward Lear Hotel? A great place to stay!	We stayed at The Edward Lear Hotel in early July 2009. The hotel was always clean and tidy and all the staff were friendly and courteous. A wholesome and substantial cooked English breakfast was provided every morning and it was always delicious! This is an affordable no-frills hotel in an excellent central London location (3 minutes Oxford Street/ Marble Arch!) and we would not hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to family and friends.Well done Edward Lear we will be coming back! Chris Beddoes and family. South Devon. UK
8,714,"Aug 30 2009 	Not very big on space	Our room was on the street and up on the third floor (no lift), even though we'd booked two months in advance. Unfortunately, all twin rooms are on the street so they couldn't do much about that. The breakfast room was tiny and very hot and stuffy in the middle of summer. Food was good. We decided to leave early and were told because we hadn't given them 14 hours notice, we'd have to pay for the extra night. So after I explained that the room hadn't been cleaned properly and the cleaner had left the second lock on the door unlocked after I'd locked it that morning, they said we wouldn't have to pay after all."
9,714,"Aug 24 2009 	Pleasant Accommodation Central Location	The Edward Lear is a very pleasant and affordable hotel. My visit from check in until check out was nearly flawless. Clean and well staffed and maintained. I recommend this for travelers to London who appreciate this hotel's central location to Oxford Street, Hyde Park, Cent'l London attractions and Underground transportation. A great value!"
10,714,"Aug 21 2009 	Nice little hotel friendly staff convenient 	I stayed in a twin room with my daughter. The room was small (as expected) but clean and comfortable. Towels were not replaced till we left them on the floor, which is fine but I would have appreciated a sign or notice explaining this. The best part of this hotel is the staff -- they are friendly and helpful, gave us good restaurant recommendations and cheerfully answered all my questions. Breakfast is adequate but I was very tired of overcooked eggs and canned tomatoes after a few days. The location is convenient, especially with the tube station right around the corner. The only negative about this hotel is that it was very hot in the rooms and in the dining room. It's much hotter inside the hotel than outside, and it didn't seem to cool off at night, even with the windows open. And with the window open, you will hear quite a bit of street noise at night, at least in the front of the hotel."
11,714,Jul 30 2009 	Unreliable internet	Internet kept failing. Tiny rooms. Baking hot everywhere especially breakfast room. Friendly staff. Hotel keeps external lights on all day despite blinding sunshine and despite being told twice - do these people have no concept of global warming?
12,714,"Jun 13 2009 	perfect!!! just what i needed had a wonderful stay here.	really friendly staff, rooms were clean and were very well equipped. free internet use for guests. the shared bathroom was really clean. the location was brilliant, right off Oxford St and close to the tube and bus stops. very much looking forward to my next visit to thhe hotel."
13,714,"Jun 10 2009 	Friendly staff. Average comfort. Convenient	Hotel very convenient for buses and tube. Outside welcoming, lots of flowers.Chairs very uncomfortable. No chairs in bedroom. View from Breakfast room window awful.Food adequate but tinned tomatoes for breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful, they are the best thing about this hotel."
14,714,"Apr 29 2009 	Great Location and Friendly Staff	My friend and I stayed here before Christmas to do some shopping, but mostly sight seeing. The hotel is in a great location, so close to Oxford Street and very handy if you dont want to be carrying your bags all round London, especially if youre planning on sightseeing too. We found the hotel a little hard to find at the start, and we were a bit apprehensive when we saw how close it was to Oxford Street, but it is quite remote and very charming on arrival. It looks like a country house from outside. Reception is at the back of the hotel. I found the staff very friendly, and when we were leaving, they allowed us to leave our bags in reception while we went to get lunch and take in a few more sights before we headed to the airport instead of hauling out bags around. Our room was very basic, although we were there in the height of winter and with single pain windows, it got quite cold, but there were spare blankets in the cupboard. Hotel supplies, hair-dryer, TV and wake-up service if I remember correctly. The bathroom was very simple, but was very pleased with the shower. It was amazing stepping into a spacious and warm shower after getting soaked and mud all over us from Hyde Parks Winter Wonderland (which is a must if you plan on visiting in December)Another good is the hotels breakfast!! Served 7-9, but try to be down before 8:30 as it can get quite crowded, which might result in you sitting separately from family or friends. You might be put off by the fact the hotel has no lifts, but if you plan on traveling light, then I wouldnt let this put you off.Hope this helps, and enjoy your stay in London!"
15,714,"Apr 13 2009 	Great London Experience	The Edward Lear Hotel is the perfect hotel for a real London Experience. Yes there are stairs and yes they creak and the building is old but the quaintness makes the stay worth while. The beds are comfortable, the breakfast is great, the location is perfect (just around the corner from the Marble Arch Tube) and it is clean! All that for less than an arm and a leg - hard to find in London. My 10 year old son and I loved it and we will return - so much nicer than the big box type hotels-more like staying in a home."
16,714,"Apr 7 2009 	Great location and friendly staff	I have stayed at Ed Lear several times. It is great if you like shopping in Oxford Street. Also its near Hyde Park which is nice. The staff at the hotel have always been very friendly and the included breakfast is okay too.Some of the rooms are quite small but you dont spend too much time there anyway. All rooms have a sink and a few has a shower. The shared bathroom is no problem at all. I have never stayed at a hotel where the bathroom is shared, but it proved to work out well. I recommend this hotel to everyone."
17,714,"Mar 28 2009 	Friendly and very nice hotel in walking distance to many attractions in London city!!	I stayed her for 4 nites in januari 2009, with my sister and first cousin. We had a wonderfull time in London and couldnt have asked for a friendlier hotel so close to all the attractions!! Every morning we started the day with the full breakfast they had at the hotel. The room we had was nice and comfy with our own bathroom. The staff at the breakfast were very friendly and when we needed directions or anything else, the girls in the reception were very helpfull.We will deffenetly be back and we highly recomend this hotel.From 3 swedish girls who had a faboluse time in London"
18,714,"Mar 15 2009 	Central location for Busy London Visitor	I took my teenager for a week to London for Spring Break from Atlanta. We researched hotels based on location and price. We knew we'd be running around all day and evening for the entire week and just needed a comfortable base to crash. Edward Lear fit the bill perfectly for the price and its quirkiness will probably enrich her memories of the trip years from now. The Positives: We'd start out the day with a full breakfast, nice and filling served by a congenial staff. With a limitless oystercard for public transportation on the tube and buses plus easy walking distance to shopping and sites made this property top for location. Discounts tickets for some attractions through the hotel saved us money too.FREE WIRELESS WAS PERFECT and saved us Data charges from our US carrier or from having to find a local wireless hotspot. The Internet computer for guest use came in handy a few times when I got sick of using my Iphone.The Realities:This is a place for an unpretentious traveler who does not mind hefting their bags up possibly four floors of stairs (I run regularly but even those stairs got me winded and I was on the 3rd floor). The rooms are spartan with little room for much other than the two twin beds (we stayed in a double with a bathroom). Our room did have a flat screen TV for winding down at night. Breakfast menu is exactly the same everyday and would sure make it a little more enjoyable for even a little variation. (Only so many days you can have eggs, bacon, sausage, tomato or baked beans!) Also having b'fast last until even just 9:30 on weekdays would help in not having to rush down to catch it before it ends (afterall we are on vacation!)Maintenance needs to go through each room and check for minor problems that could bother even the less fussy patron. (whoever painted our room spilled paint on the windows which were never scraped off. Sink had an odor and probably needed to be snaked.) Again not a big deal for us but even at this good a price it would be a problem for many.In Conclusion: Look around at what you can get for the money in the heart of the city and you will see that Edward Lear offers the most for the least. I'd stay there again, because for us, it's all about the city and what it has to offer."
19,714,"Feb 9 2009 	The best located hotel with the best price!	The Edward Lear hotel is my personal favorite place to stay in London. Its the best hotel if you want an easy access from the airport right to your hotel, if you wanna be right in the center of London but dont wanna pay a fortune. To get there its best to fly to Luton Airport and from there take the Green Line to Marble Arch. When you get off at Marble Arch youll just have to crross the street and walk a view meters and there it is, just at the end of Oxford Street a few meters from the best shops away! The breakfast is full English breakfast with eggs of you choice, beans, bacon, tomatoes, cornflakes,all you need! The rooms are rather small and not very modern, but with comfortable beds, TV, tea maker and all you need really. Be aware: theres no elevator in the house and the stairway is very narrow! When youve got the windows open it can be a bit loud from the road but it will always be like that just in the center. The people on the reception are very friendly and will help with really everyting. Theres internet access for free and lots of books and magazines to read. So if you are not too complicated and not too keen on luxury hotels, you will love this hotel! The best location for the best price."
20,714,"Jan 25 2009 	Very impressed with standard	GREAT location first of all. But REALLY impressed with the standard - went with a sister and we got a totally new-done twin room at top floor - we were not so keen on the stairs though...However, the standard and the way the hotel is run suits us. The breakfast is freshly made - and there is plenty of it. Compared to other hotels in eg Bayswater - this is a true winner - and the location for shopping, busses and the tube is super.Hope to find the standard is still the same when we visit again in 2010 (we hope).Pia"
21,714,"Jan 24 2009 	very helpful	The staff is really helpful and nice, good breakfast , very clean and the hotel is situated in the centre"
22,714,"Jan 23 2009 	Friendly!! Clean!! Great location!!Very nice Breakfast!!	Friendly!! Clean!! Great location!!Very nice Breakfast!!Basically 1 minute from Oxford Street, next to Marble Arch Station. So convinient location to go anywhere in London!! The prices are very reasonable and shared bathroom was more than ok.. I really never saw anyone in the bathroom for 7 days! Not more than 2-3 people share each bathroom and there is one in each floor. My room was cleaned and my bed made every day. Staff was very helpful and friendly. It is like living in a big house but in no way it gives the impression of a youth hostel or anything like that. I met almost everyone that was staying there, either in the computer room or the breakfast room. The atmosfhere makes u want to be friendly with everyone :))I am going back to the hotel definatelly!!"
23,714,"Jan 7 2009 	Decent stay in a Great Location	My friend and I booked into a double ensuite room over the period of 26th-28th December. Needless to say our main purpose was to take advantage of the boxing day sales, so the proximity of the hotel to Oxford Street (literally 1 minute away) was simply perfect.The hotel itself is slightly on the old side, but the room we were in was exceptionally clean - and the modern good-sized bathroom was a very welcomed surprise. Quirky placemats and drawings in the breakfast room (nonsense rhymes by Edward Lear), adequate breakfast. Reception was friendly, allowed us to leave our bags at the desk so that we could go off and enjoy our last day in London without having to lug them around. What I liked:Fantastic location - very short walk to Oxford Street, Marble Arch, Hyde Park, tube station etc.Clean and well-furbished- TV, tea/coffee making facilities, hairdryer providedFriendly staff, easy check in and check outHuge well-stocked bookshelfFree internet access Vague misgivings:Noise - the hotel is on a very quiet street, but we could hear passing daytime traffic from our street-facing window (didn't bother me but my friend found it slightly annoying as she wasn't feeling well and tried to take an afternoon nap). Also we could hear people talking in the corridor and opening and shutting doors.No lifts - if you have heavy bags, the rickety stairs are going to be a challenge.All in all good value for money, especially if you're keen on shopping!"
24,714,"Nov 25 2008 	Great location	Had family room,positives  double and 2 single beds - great when you have adult size teenagers. Beds comfy. Room adequate size for price.Great location - just off Oxford street, Marble Arch end, short walk from tube and shops.Friendly and helpful staff.Breakfast fine.Room clean especially bathroom nice.Computor room for guest useNegativeswindows need double glazing 2 problems at front hear noise at night (although to be fair second night we didnt hear any thing) also there was a draft flowing through.corridors tired and in need of decorating (spoke to reception staff - in process of updating waiting for grants etc.Overall couldn't really fault hotel we would stay here again."
25,714,"Nov 23 2008 	Decent place for the price	Given the location, this is one of the better values for money that I have found in London. The room was clean and the shared bathroom was acceptable. The staff were all very friendly, very welcoming and amenable. It was easy to find, only about a ten minute walk from any tube station. There was tea and coffee in the room, which is always nice.A word to the wise, ask to not stay on the ground floor. The walls are quite thin and the bustle from the kitchen staff getting ready woke me up before six."
26,714,"Oct 24 2008 	quaint hotel super cool value	My boyfriend and I (both American, early 20's) stayed here in Oct 2008 and really liked the hotel. I made reservations directly with the hotel staff by phone and they were very helpful and accommodating. Upon arrival our room wasn't available for early morning check in but they held our bags while we explored the city. The rooms are cute and comfortable, definitely spacious enough for two. It's an older building but everything was in good working order. I liked that they incorporated a lot of Edward Lear's poems and illustrations in the hotel decor. We had a room facing the street but didn't find it to be noisy. As we were there at a slightly less busy time of the year we had no problems getting breakfast or using the computer in the lounge. Good food and free internet access! They also had a good selection of new magazines and travel books/ brochures in the lobby. The hotel location was wonderful; two short blocks from the underground station and a five minute walk from Hyde park. The neighborhood had a range of shops and restaurants including a couple fast food joints open late for those of us suffering from jet-lag.I have no complaints about our stay and would definitely recommend it for its reasonable price and great location. Since it's a small, older, quiet building it's probably not a great choice for families, larger groups or anyone with small kids, but a good pick for younger singles or couples looking for cozy accommodations after a busy day of sightseeing."
27,714,"Sep 5 2008 	Convenient to Marble Arch Tube	We chose the Edward Lear for value in a London stay.The staff is very courteous and we found them to be helpful and pleasant.We booked a room with a shared bath for our initial visit to save $60.00 a night.This would have been okay,but it was right next to the breakfast room and other guests left wet towels on the floor.The room had no ac,no cross ventilation,and as it was August,we were warm.They provided small fans for the room.The breakfast was big,and we enjoyed sitting with the other guests.The Marble Arch Tube station is around the corner,one block or less,and we used it daily. We returned for one night and stayed in a room with bath and shower which was much more pleasant with flowers in the window boxes.We did close the windows to shut out the street noise.this room on the street side. It was nice to be able to check email while there.The Edward Lear is nothing fancy,but we found it convenient and safe and enjoyed meeting the guests fromNew Zaland,Belgium,the US,etc."
28,714,"Aug 9 2008 	Sleepless in London	We stayed at the Edward Lear from 11 - 14 July 2008. The location is excellent for shopping - near Oxford Street where you can easily catch a bus or tube. The historic building is beautiful, the rooms neat and clean, and the television has a variety of channels. We stayed in room 16, on the street, which turned out to be a very bad idea. It was extremely noisy day and night, always, all the time. We did not have one good night's sleep while staying here.Breakfast is typically British, filling and huge. But the breakfast room is very small and stuffy. You can hardly move or breathe. If you go down for breakfast after 8.30, chances are that you will have to stand in line to wait for a table to open. Eventually we just skipped breakfast. It is also almost impossible to use the internet - there is only one computer and every time there was already someone using it, with someone else waiting in line. For a budget hotel we will resommend the Edward Lear - just make sure that you don not get a room on the street."
29,714,"Jun 19 2008 	Do Not Let Hotel Book Your Taxi !!!	Very friendly staff, although hotel as a whole needs updating badly, saying that the rooms are very clean and mine actually nothing like the picture but quite modern...BUT the single is very, very small, infact the smallest I have ever seen (we are talking 5 foot wide by about 8 foot - and that really is it), the rest of the hotels available floor space is used as a dumping ground, one of the toilets is stocked up with tins of paint and rolls of material and boxes so you cant actually get in to it, the internet room too has all the leather chairs (that you can see in the pictures) stacked up in the corner so you cant sit on them and boxes in there stacked up too. Don't get me wrong they are lovely friendly people and the breakfast is one of the best I have had.BUT be very aware that if you get the hotel to ring a taxi, they infact ring a company who will charge you the EARTH to drop you off where you are going and and who don't actually have a meter and after pointing this out to them they admitted they are not a real taxi company and hence not insured and it is a little scam that the hotel have going and we would need to take it up with the hotel. Just bear in mind the day before this we flagged down a black cab outside the hotel who took us the same journey for 5.60.This 'TAXI' that the hotel 'organised' for us charged us 12 for exactly the same journey which we discovered is a 15 min walk away this is why I was concerned.DO NOT USE THE HOTEL TO BOOK A TAXI FOR YOU!!! FLAG DOWN A BLACK CAB OUTSIDE.We mentioned this to the hotel when we go back and they admitted they are just a company that the management tell them to use !!!But they will mention our concerns to the managers.Very worrying stuff!!!"
30,714,"May 28 2008 	A very pleasant surprise	My husband, our two daughters (11 and 8) and I just got back from a trip to England. For the 3 days that we spent in London, we stayed at the Edward Lear Hotel on Seymour Street. The hotel is a converted row house, and, as the name suggests, was once the home of poet/artist Edward Lear. Given the price of everything in England, at 125 pounds per night B&amp;B for the four of us, we really didn't have high expectations for the Edward Lear. Fortunately, we were very pleasantly surprised. Having read prior reviews of this hotel, I have to agree - the corridors are narrow, the stairs are slanted and crooked, but so what? If you want posh, then pay posh and stay posh. We were on the second floor in a 'family room' with a double bed and two single beds. Our room was immaculate, the beds were extremely comfortable (memory foam mattresses - MMmmmm!), the ensuite bathroom was brand new with a properly flushing toilet and good pressure in the shower. There was lots of lighting, lots of drawers and closet space, and lots of tea/coffee/hot chocolate etc. in the room for our use. In short, our room had no faults that we could detect, and was, in fact, much nicer than some for which we had paid more.The staff at the hotel were all extremely pleasant and very willing to assist with any inquiries that we had. Breakfast was served in a small breakfast room that was very clean and sunny. Some people had to sit with strangers at their table, but, again, so what? It's breakfast! You're travelling! Meet new people! We were a party of four, so didn't have the opportunity to do that, but would have welcomed it if it was necessary. The food was lovely with breakfast for each of us being made to order, and served promptly from a charming dumb waiter coming up from the kitchen. All in all, we found the Edward Lear Hotel to be a charming spot and a comfortable haven after whirlwind days of touring and dashing around London. We would happily stay there again."
31,714,"May 26 2008 	Great	Stayed there 10 days. It's warm, friendly, and in an excellent location. Walkable to the Tube. It's an old building, as most places in London are. Some rooms are a bit slanted, but that adds to the charm, as does climbing up the stairs. This is a real find and great B&amp;B choice. Very helpful staff who will help you plan your day. Nice sitting area.Cheers!"
32,714,"May 17 2008 	Great Cheap Hotel in London	We two gents went for our first trip to London/UK from May 3-10 and booked the entire stay with Edward Lear. As a frame of reference, we do not, nor can we afford to stay at more costly hotels. What we seek is clean, cheap and convenient to the locations we want to explore. As an example, we have stayed at Hotel Harrington while in Washington DC. in September 07Edward Lear is a small older hotel converted from a Victorian residence, and we were originally concerned because it is a five story walk-up (no elevators) The there is only one room in the category we booked..a single standard (shared bath) . It was a large room with two single beds separated by a nightstand. It's located on the first floor!...We weren't told this when we booked, but we were very pleased, because we had asked for a lower floor; (we're in our 50s and 60s and not into jaunting up 1 flight, let alone 5!) Serendipity! Ask for room number 3. It did have a sink in a closet. Other amenities in the room included a phone, very small TV which was a bit two far from the beds, though we didn't watch much anyway. There were no chairs - given the size of the room, at least one would have been good, and two would have fit. There was a small stand with an electric coffee/tea pot well stocked with tea, coffee, sugar and creamers. There was a small closet which held what we had brought easily. The window in the room offered no view - just light in the day..and looked out over the basement kitchen glass ceiling...and thats about it.The shared bath was right down the hall...only two other rooms on that floor...and during the whole time i only ran into one fellow bather who got to me just ahead. It's small, with a shower...towels seemed to pile up during the day on the floor as there was no place to deposit a dirty one.The three rooms share the floor with the front desk, computer room, ( which gets busy in the morning and evening..plan to wait if you didnt bring a lap top)I was amazed at how quiet the hotel seemed. We got good nights rest, every night of our stay, and only once heard someone come in late. Housekeeping was done every day while we were out with no issues at all. Everything was refreshed, replenished, and straightened.Staff was congenial and helpful when we needed information.The breakfast is huge...nicely presented, and well cooked. As an American, the tomatoes and beans threw me off, but i got right into them, and by the end, ate the whole thing!...There are only 6 tables (four tops) in the dining room, which is smallish, and served by a dumb waiter from the basement kitchen. We got started early each day..weekdays it opened at 7 30 and weekends 8 am. Table is set with LARGE trivets upon which your plate is set..sort of balanced...I thought that was funny..also, more silverware than is needed...an extra knife - for butter and jam, etc..but crowded the table. There is also a selection of juices, milk, cereals, etc.Locationally, we couldn't have asked for better..great shopping is very near by..Selfridge's right around the corner..don't miss it - you can walk. Hyde park and Marble arch tube is a block away.There is a movie house around the corner as well....an Odeon we were shocked that we were asked to select seats based on price, and proximity..take the cheap seats...the theaters are small.Gay gents - the Quebec bar, London's oldest , since 1946, is in the next block...(and some of the original clientle were there the two nights we stopped in). For Americans, we paid the equivalent of 7dollars for a large coke, and 6 for an equal size beer..go figure. Take the tube to Leicester Square, check out the cheap theater ticks (go to the official booth which is a stand alone building in the square, not around the perimeter) We saw Spamalot and had a great time. From Leicester, walk over to Soho for lots of other bars...and drinking in the street...everywhere in London, pubs spilled out with people drinking in the street. Try the Geisha Bar for upscale decor, and very quiet. next door is a more typical bar catering to all kinds of gents. We didn't venture further - we could have all night..bars are open apparently 24 hours.We purchased a London Pass...we feel we did well with saving on some of the attractions. Check it out...and take the transportation option - you will save even more. Practically speaking, we were able to do about 3 major things a day on it, by hustling. Also we did some driving..we took the tube back out to Heathrow, got off at Hatton Cross Station and walked across the street behind sixT and picked up a rental car at Car1Hire or something like that, which we had prearrange...we drove to Knowle, Sissinghurst, and to Bath over two days and then back into London...we retained our hotel room during our absence.Re Heathrow, we flew US Air - into Heathrow Terminal One and were through customs in 10 - TEN - minutes.I could write a book..first time was a great time and would love to go back..and would stay at Edward Lear again, as well.Sorry i don't have photos to share..what was I thinking..I didn't take any at all of the hotel..:("
33,714,"May 3 2008	ok just about	Booked via laterooms, who told me that the cc no. was taken merely to reserve the room. However, cc statement showed that the full amount was debited instantly by the hotel. At least they didnt ask me to pay again when I got there (has happened at some other places).Not really a hotel, its a basic B&amp;B. Great location near Marble Arch/Oxford Street is the only real reason for staying here and ok for those who wish to spend most of the day out and about. Small Alba TV in room, + sink,+ bed...that's your lot. Shower room/toilet down the corridor had a mouldy floor, the breakfast room was too small for the no. of guests so strangers finish up being put together at the same table. Free internet access in a sort of sitting room. Friendly staff. Basically ok as an overnighter or 2 nights, but dont expect too much for your money."
34,714,"Apr 15 2008 	Friendly clean and good location!	We booked this hotel when seen on Tripadvisor and saw the different reviews here. Well we're absolutely positive about this hotel:the staff is very friendly, good English breakfast, clean and spacious room and not unimportant: the bed slept very well!For a London hotel this a good value hotel, due to many other hotels in the city for this price is this much better. We had a room with private facilities, and these were also clean and new. The last day we could leave our luggage at the reception for free. And in the salon is a free internet acces for guest.Further the location is very good, just round the corner is the tubestation Marble Arch and that is also the beginning of Oxford Street. So you can easily walk to the shops. A the tube station also many buses stop, so that's also handy! The neighbourhood is good and at night their is not so much noise (always a little offcourse when you stay in the middle of town!).The only thing you should bother about the hotel: there is no elevator, but I didn't care about that: because of eating some many delicious things around town, it was good to walk te stairs.. ;-) but something to think about when you're not so healthy.If you're going to London: Enjoy!!"
35,714,"Apr 1 2008	There Must Be Another Edward Lear Hotel	I just returned from England to Canada, I had a wonderful experience all with the exception of our stay in London at the Edward Lear hotel. We arrived late and had to wait outside while the staff had a smoke in the lower regions of the Hotel. We stood at street level and watched as they had a smoke break in the pit below. Garbage surrounded them as they looked back at us while we waited for a staff member to let us in. When they did bother to open the door we were escorted to room 1A a room outside near the main entrance. To our horror we looked around the room and witnessed a bed without a frame under it, a shower stall next to the bed, dirty ceilings cob webs slung across the fixtures. The bathroom was dingy ....floors were sagging and appeared to be weak. The shower was so uneven the door would not close and the shower head was barley attached and in its and cradle was pointed in an inward direction so no water hits your body. We realized our mistake however it was late so sucked it up and endured the rest of the night. We made an attempt at a sleep to get the nightmare over quick as possible. Sleep did not come easy as the bed was horrible. I read the other reviews some even give this place 5 stars ....all I can say is there has to be another Edward Lear hotel in London cause we certainly missed it!"
36,714,"Mar 28 2008 	Better than we thought	We booked at this particular hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. Some were good and some were bad so we didn't have a whole lot of expectations. We were pleasantly surprised, the rooms were clean, yes there is no elevator but a little bit of exercise is good especially after their fabulous breakfast. They are just finishing their renovations, new carpet, paint etc...the back stairwell was a bit tricky (almost fell down it a couple of times) but overall the hotel was nice. The price was a bit steep ($97 pounds - this was the most we paid on our trip) but it was in a nice area. Just 4-5 blocks away is James Street where this is a variety of restaurants to choose from and only 1 block away from the underground train."
37,714,Mar 26 2008	we loved it	we loved it!!we were 5 friends who had the family room!!great location...walking distance from everything and the tube just next to us!!!one of the most helpfull reception in anything we needed!good valuefor money
38,714,"Mar 4 2008	LOVED Edward Lear Hotel!	I wanted to thank you for the wonderful time we had at your hotel! This was our first time to venture to another country,and we were a little nervous booking a hotel online. But when we arrived every fear we had disappeared.The quick response to any questions I had really impressed me from the very first email. You are very professional and friendly!Thank you for the wonderful breakfasts, clean rooms, and very helpful staff. We loved our trip to visit London. I am already looking for flights to come back soon! Debi Hampton Washington State USA"
39,714,"Feb 11 2008 	very good hotel	very good location for this charming hotel, we stayed 2 nights in a double ensuite room, which was perfect for this price range. the room was clean and confortable, good english breakfast, and friendly staff. We will stay here again for our next travel!!"
40,714,"Oct 8 2007 	Would definitely stay here again	We stayed at the Edward Lear Hotel for 4 nights. Location is fabulous - very central to everything. We had the quad room with bath and toilet, its worth paying extra for these facilities. The building is old like most english buildings, wonky stairs and all. Breakfast is included in your stay which was great. There is so much to see and do in London we basically just showered and slept in the room. The only thing we needed in our room was a small refrigerator for fresh milk and drinks. But compared to other London accommodation you can't beat the price."
41,714,"Sep 4 2007 	Don't be so cheap	In an effort not to go bankrupt due to our weekend in London, we selected the Edward Lear based partly on its inclusion in the DK Eyewitness Travel guide but mostly on its price. At 95/night, the Lear came in a good 25 cheaper than other options in central London. Nonetheless for the equivalent of nearly $200 we expected that it would meet a certain standard of comfort. Arriving late in the evening after a long journey, we were quite discouraged to find that while the room (room 1A) did have a shower as promised, the shower was a stand-alone unit installed into the bookcase next to the bed. I'm as lazy as the next guy but I really do prefer to have my shower in the bathroom. Call me crazy. We might have been inclined to describe this as merely quirky but the ripped sheets covering the plastic cover on the matters, the general dinginess of the room and the hostel-like environment that kept us awake most of the night was enough to send us running the next morning. We gladly put down the extra 25 to stay around the corner at the Cumberland. For our money, we easily doubled or tripled our comfort. $200 may seem like a lot for a room, but until you've spent a night in the Edward Lear, you'll never understand just how little it really buys you. Don't be cheap - spend an extra $50 and stay somewhere that offers a shower in room where it belongs and bans the back-packers and hostel-goers."
42,714,"Aug 20 2007 	great location with ""charm""	When you hear the word &quot;charm&quot; it usually means accommodations that haven't quite entered the modern world. True enough here, but what can you expect of an old residence on a London city block that has been horsewhipped into a stopping place for modern travelers? Our room was at the top of the stairs, so we immediately wanted a lift. Bathroom facilities were old and leaky, but worked, although a standup shower instead of a handheld tub squatter would have been nice. Rooms were small, but had lots of storage crannies. Kid's &quot;bed&quot; was first a cot with broken slats, and then just a mattress on the floor. Weather was cool, but on hot days you'll want an air conditioner. Breakfast was filling, without many choices. Staff was excellent, helpful, and smart. Oh, and the wifi connection lets you research restaurants etc in your room, even from the top floor. Great location near Marble Arch. Would I stay there again? Mm, maybe, but those stairs don't work with a heavy suitcase. Nosebleeders and those with BP problems beware."
43,714,"Jul 25 2007 	Cosy and perfect location	My six year old son and I stayed at the Edward Lear for 4 nights at the end of June. Our double room was way at the top of the stairs, and was quite comfortable. The sheets and towels were of good quality and fresh. We shared a bath, but never encountered any other guests, and it was perfectly clean. The breakfasts were good; the coffee fresh. On the whole, we were very cosy and happy with our stay. And the location could not be better! I would certainly recommend this hotel!"
44,714,"Jul 23 2007 	High Maintenance Travellers Beware	I read all the reviews for the Edward Lear and was pretty nervous about staying here. I heard about some pretty dismal sitautions. When I got there, I realized it may be a result of high maintenance travellers.I don't know about the bug situation, as I have read there are lots in this location. I never experienced any bugs while staying there for four nights. In fact, our room was really pretty clean. I rarely do this, but I even walked around without shoes on. It's definitely clean enough. Another complaint was about the stairs. There is a long walk up the stairs, but it's central London. Every time I've been there I've had the same kind of walk up. It's not a big deal. You can't beat this location... I am not kidding you. Three blocks from the Marble Arch and its tube station. That's an unbeatable location. It's becoming a diverse neighborhood, so there's lots of fun Middle Eastern, Indian, and Japanese restaurants. You're three blocks from Hyde Park and right there on Oxford Street. You get a lot of great sites for this location.My only complaints are fairly superficial. I don't care to share a table at breakfast, which we did one of our mornings... the breakfast room is small so it's going to happen. But that's not a big deal. And the internet is a bit finicky. We were trying to get tickets to Wimbledon and it took over 30 minutes to get some very simple information (the tube stop). If you go expecting the Ritz. Don't stay here. Go stay at the Ritz. If you go expecting a typical central London inn, it's just fine."
45,714,"Jul 5 2007 	Great Location and lots of room in our triple	We stayed in a triple and although we had to hike to the 4th floor, we enjoyed all the room in our place. We did have to share a toliet and shower but we got used to it. The breakfast was delicious. SO much to eat, cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon , beans, tomatos, toast.This area had great shopping very close by. They had an ironing board on the bottom floor for community use. Hairdryer to ask at the desk. We loved the internet. There is a lounge area where the internet is - but it closes at 10 pm. The beds were comfy enough and the room was clean."
46,714,"Jun 15 2007 	Great Location Decent Enough Accommodation if On A Budget	My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in June. We did not want to spend a ton of money but we did not want to stay in hostel either. This hotels location is AWESOME!!! Very safe and quiet as well. So close to the best shoping in London and minutes from the Marble Arch tube station which is very convenient as well. If you are travelling on the tube for more than 5 days get a 7 day travel card (oyster card), much cheaper and convenient to swipe in and out. The hotel staff were very, very friendly and our room was ready when we checked in early (noon). Be ware of having to carry heavy suitecases up lots of flights of stairs if you are on a high floor as they do not have elevators. Pros of the room: decent size for London, coffee and tea maker, bed was OK, room was quiet. Cons: carpet is old and needs cleaning (bring flip flops or slippers, flip flops for sure if you have a shared shower room). The bedding could use upgrading, pretty shabby. We only had breakfast one day and it was pretty decent. The free internet computer was awesome, always worked and never a long wait.This hotel is a great choice if you are looking for a great location, not too expensive and can over look the run down side of the hotel. I would stay here again for sure."
47,714,"Jun 6 2007 	Reasonable affordable accomodations	Perfectly adequate and reasonably priced accomodations. The pros: its a great location...near a tube and hyde park, but out of the way just enough with lots of (relatively) cheap eats nearby. The room was clean and perfectly livable. The cons: the rooms are small and the beds are hard. We lost hot water in our shower one day and it was quickly fixed."
48,714,"Mar 14 2007 	Good value for money	Great place to rest your head. Not great if you plan to stay in your room, 24 hours a day. I just slept there and had the very good breakfast. Clean and tidy with helpful staff."
49,714,Mar 13 2007 	Horrible	Fifthly!!! I had to kill all the cockroaches before my wife saw them. Do not stay in this hotel.
50,714,"Feb 25 2007 	Good Value	Okay this is not a 4 star hotel! However if u are on a budget and are only going to be in your room for sleeping this place is great! Myself and my sister booked for 9 days this past month. Breakfast was adequate, rooms were clean, bathrooms were clean and we didn't have to wait to use them as we didn't have an ensuite room. Knowing we were going to be there for 9 days they where kind enough to give us a triple room while honoring there price for a twin for us. This was great in that it gave us a bigger room. Yes this place could use some sprucing up but you really can't beat the location. A block from an underground station made it so easy to get around town and even get in the tube station really early in the morning for our Train to Paris and our way back to Heathrow on the tube was quick and easy. Not to mention being a block away from Oxford street and Bond street with all that shopping to do was just great!Staff was fantastic!!! I got sick there and they were kind enough to help me find a walk-in clinic that afternoon!  Also having internet access was such an added plus!  As you can see I was very pleased with this location. Will for sure be coming back and letting friends know about this place. I figure I would just spend more on the town then on my hotel stay and I made a great call there!!"
51,714,"Feb 11 2007 	abysmal	Just had my Worst travel experience EVER staying here! Some of the reviews cannot possibly be talking about the same hotel I stayed in last night. Although the bedrooms are reasonable other areas of the hotel are dirty, discusting and potentially dangerous! Key points for me were: Mice droppings in the hotelReally bad damp and falling apart floors in some of the bathroomsNo late check in, despite letting them know of my late arrival then ending up being stood on the doorstep for half and hour in the rain!No lift and stairway handrails falling apartEquipment broken/not workingThis hotel is very VERY overpriced for what it offers.... we had a choice between this and a three star hotel for 65.00 for the night. We chose this unware of the condition as it looks and sounds nice from the description. Don't be fooled - this place is not worth the money... check out some of the nearby youth hostels, low budget hotels or Laterooms where you can pick up much better for the same price! if you are on a tight budget and want somewhere safe and warm to stay!Although this hotel has history it is in need of some serious TLC.. until then avoid it!"
52,714,"Feb 7 2007 	Not the Ritz but great value	I needed a room near Park Lane for a single night for business. At the price I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but was pleasantly surprised.The staff were very friendly and welcoming.The room was small by modern standards, but was perfectly adequate. The decor was a bit dull, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable.Having read previous reviews regarding the stairs, I took a small bag. Fortunately, I was only on the first floor. However, I can imagine it would be very difficult to manage a suitcase - the stairs are quite narrow.The breakfast room got quite crowded at about 07:45. I guess a lot of the guests were on business or wanted an early start. It would be more comfortable if you could leave it until later.For an overnight stay in the heart of London, you can't beat this hotel for value."
53,714,"Feb 6 2007	Just what we were looking for	We spend 3 nights at the Edward Lear last October- would stay there again. We arrived in London with no room reservations except for our first night. The Edward Lear was listed in the (less than 50 pounds/ night) section of our travel book- so we set out on foot to find it. Turning the corner on Seymore Street- my girlfriend spotted a B&amp;B that had tons of flowers nearly covering the entire front of the building- she instantly said that we should stay there- it was the Edward Lear. I thought, oh great- this place is going to be all show and no go. Whoops- I was wrong. Next time we will save about 15 L a night and get a room with no shower or toilet. Each floor has about 5 rooms, and a full bathroom down the hall. I never once saw another person in the bathroom (and the B&amp;B was full)- most rooms are en suite- so no need to pay extra. The breakfast was okay- a bit crowded- but we were happy with a few eggs and tea- we wanted to spend our trip on the streets- not in the hotel dining room anyway. Our room was on the 3rd floor- hope you don't mind stairs- it was what you should expect for only 50 L/night- not brand new- but lots of closet and drawer space. The location is very good. The Marble Arch tube station is only 2 blocks away- and there is a mini-mart with chips/beer/soda 1 block away. This B&amp;B is one block off of Oxford Street- very safe to walk home if you are up late at night. The only thing lacking was there were no pubs/cafes (except Pret) within about a 10 minute walk. Also- A bit of street noise and no AC- so if you are a light sleeper during the summer- you'll have to choose between noise or heat."
54,714,"Dec 27 2006 	Perfect locationvery good bargain	I spent my Christmas holiday in Edward Lear hotel and I feel very satisfied with my choice.It is ideal for people that asks for a central place to stay in London but they don't want to spend a fortune for a 4 star hotel.On the other hand if you are used to a luxury hotel service is under your expectations. It's an old traditional english house with many narrow stairs,without elevator.Because of this I highly reccomend to have a room in a lower floor because it is not easy to carry on a heavy suitcase. I stayed with my friends in a quite comfortable room for 4 people,clean and warm.I preffered a room with its own bath and toilet.The room service was very good with the exception of 25th of December. Breakfast included cerials,juices,eggs,sausages,tomatoes etc.Keep in mind that in London many hotels charge extra money for English breakfast. Finally I don't find necessary to say anything about the location.Absolutely perfect.Seymour str.is the second str.behind Oxford str."
55,714,"Dec 22 2006 	Fantasic place to stay!!!	This hotel exceded expectations!!! It had a great atmosphere (old london house) with modern features, and was in a central location (2mins to marble arch, train station and Oxford st shopping). The staff were friendly and the rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable (and the stairs gave you a nice, easy work out!). Quite, no traffic, great breakfast!!!!I went there with a family of 5 and we were all very comfortable.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and obviously will be happy to return."
56,714,"Oct 26 2006 	Edward Lear is a bargain!	I have just returned from London, staying five nights at the Edward Lear Hotel. I was looking for a bargain, and this hotel is that. My single room (no bathroom) was very small, almost a broom closet, but I knew that going in. The room was clean; the breakfast each morning absolutely delicious, and the guests interesting and fun to talk to. Many are return customers, liking the bargain and the history attached to the hotel. I was on the second floor, so be mindful that there is no elevator! The bathroom was kept clean, and yes, I did have to wait a few times. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when trying to figure out how to make a phone call. I would stay here again; London is an expensive city, and you can't beat the price!!!"
57,714,"Sep 18 2006	Exactly the Deal We Were Looking For	We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near some friends by the Marble Arch. We wanted one with a full breakfast to cut down on our food costs. You can imagine our delight when we found the listing for the Edward Lear Hotel, just two blocks from the Marble Arch tube station.We would have been willing to pay slightly more to get an ensuite bath, but none were available for our dates, so we went for the shared option. Each floor had a shower room. We were worried at first that we'd have to fight for our turn at the shower, but we never saw another soul the whole three days. The shower room was somewhat dingy, but completely functional. We were amused to discover that the window well on each stairway landing had been converted into a WC. One had a particularly low ceiling, but that just added to the experience, I thought.Our room had a sink and a mirror, so we didn't have to go to the stairwell to brush our teeth or anything. The plumbing is quite old, but everything was functional. The bed was fine and the room was comfortable. The hike up the stairs was a bit intense, but I'd read about that in the Frommers review, so I was prepared. Our room was at the rear of the building and it was perfectly quiet. The TV didn't work, but we hardly spent any time in the room anyway.Breakfast was excellent. Toast, eggs, beans, tomato, bacon, sausage, juice... really filling. The girls running the breakfast room took good care of us. We hardly had to eat lunch. The breakfast room was always busy, but we never had to wait. The placemats with Edward Lear limericks on them were a nice touch.Someone said that this place is like a hostel, but with more privacy. I think that's a fairly good comparison. We knew we had to share some of the resources, but there were no problems. I have already recommended this hotel to friends."
58,714,"Aug 7 2006 	Middle Aged Couple's experience	Just had a 3 day stay at the Edward Lear Hotel, London. On the plus side, the hotel is very convenient for shopping and not too far from theatreland. The breakfast was very good also. Massive problem for us was our room - We booked online and there were no en-suite rooms available for our stay. We were obviously aware of this but because of the convenient location we still made the booking. The shared facilities were dirty. Toilet down one flight, shower room down 2 flights. Our room was at the top of the hotel - 10 flights up with no lift. Maybe OK for young people but carrying our cases up and down 88 narrow stairs was no joke! There was no mention of this on the website. The room had plenty of drawers but hardly any hanging space. The TV reception was poor and being at the top of the hotel the room was unbearably hot. Because of the above I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.Angela - Jersey, Channel Islands"
59,714,"Aug 3 2006 	Perfect Location; Great Breakfast	My husband and I stayed at the Edward Lear in October 2003 and it made our whole London trip. The full English breakfast, with sausage, beans, tomatoes, eggs, tea and toast, served to order in a sunroom, is something we still try to duplicate. The whole Edward Lear theme, and the fact that he actually lived here, was adorable. The building was beautiful - &quot;craggy brown brick&quot; type 6 story building, though the interior reminded me faintly of my college dorm. And the location was perfect, perfect, perfect: 1 block away from the subway, Hyde Park, a major bus stop, and parking, in a VERY central but still residental and relatively safe area of London.Expectations are important, though. It is not an American style commercial hotel. It is not a luxury hotel. Think charming discount european style b&amp;b -- approaching a hostel but with more privacy -- and you'll be pretty close. Many of the rooms do not have private bath - we were on the top floor with a shower and sink directly in the room, but no toilet. It was down the hall and it was perfectly clean. The stair climb (6 stories no elevator) might be a problem for some. Just be aware of what it is and isn't, and enjoy it to the fullest!"
60,714,"Jul 21 2006 	Very Disappointing	Our first trip to London was marred by our hotel stay. It was dirty and lacked charm. We arrived before check-in and asked if there was a bathroom available. They directed us a room just off the breakfast room that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months (think gas station restroom). Not all rooms have a private bath, so some guests have to use this one. I got a sinking feeling right away. My in-laws ended up with a room right next to the front door with the shower stall located next to the bed. My husband and I had a large bathroom, but no shower stall, just a handheld shower that had a leak, so water sprayed everywhere and the hotel had tried unsuccessfully to fix with tape! I don't believe our tub was ever cleaned during our 5 night stay. We were given small hotel soaps in our room at check-in but not provided with additional soaps until we asked. I also noticed that while the white bath towels appeared to be laundered every day, one day I saw stains on a towel I was about to use. In addition, the decor was last updated sometime in the 1960's, I'm sure. And a couple days we waited for in line for 20 minutes to eat breakfast because the seating is inadequate for the number of guests."
61,714,"Jun 13 2006	Great location friendly staff uncomfortable beds	The Edward Lear is reasonably priced when compared to other hotels in London and the location is perfect. Oxford Street is two blocks away, Marble Arch tube station is right around the corner and Speaker's Corner where many tours stop is close as well.The hotel staff is very friendly and breakfast is included which is a great deal. We took advantage of that every morning.The hotel does not have a lift so if you're lucky like us to stay on the 3rd floor, you will have to carry your bags up and down the narrow stairs. Also, we thought the room was OK but the beds were not very comfortable. There's a plastic lining under the sheet which stuck to me if the sheet came undone.We stayed for three nights and if I were to visit London again, I would not stay here again because of the beds."
62,714,"Apr 20 2006	Great Location but with stairs!	My family stayed 5 nights at the Edward Lear and overall we were very happy with it. Saving some accommodation money meant we had more to spend on other things in London. The showers certainly aren't great, the rooms aren't huge, the beds weren't wonderfully comfortable, but the breakfast is plentiful and the place is clean and tidy. Our biggest problem was being located on the fourth floor without a lift! A long way for my husband to lug all our bags after a long flight! Still, it was very quiet once you got there and the central London location was so convenient. We didn't spend much time in our rooms anyway, so why pay more?"
63,714,"Feb 12 2006	Value for Money	We stayed at the Hotel in January, 2006 on our weekend shopping in London. The hotel was old but quite cute. Great for travellers with a low budget for Hotels and those who do not wish to spend long periods in their room. The rooms are quite small, witht thin walls. There is everything you need to have a shower and sleep, even though you will have to step out of the shower soaked with water in the middle of the room. The breakfast was great with variety of food. One of the only problems with this hotel was that it didn't have a lift and it was fairly frustrating to go up 4 storeys with heavy shopping bags. We will definetly return, but with our room being maximum on the 2nd floor. Afterall you get value for money, cheap hotel close to oxford street."
64,714,"Sep 2 2005	Quaint Clean and at a great price.	This hotel is an OLD house, so don't expect something modern. The rooms were quaint, clean, and comfortable. If you don't know how to pack for a trip (carry huge, heavy suitcases), remember there is no elevator. But, there is free internet access in the lobby area, although it is a slow dialup. Also, the included breakfast is an excellent value. This is an inexpensive hotel in an expensive city. Our beds (wife and daughter) were very comfortable. The hotel is a short two blocks from Marble Arch tube station. There are pubs and restaurants of all varieties within blocks. We highly recommend this hotel for the value conscious. It's like staying in an old mansion. I wouldn't hesitate to book the Edward Lear again. If you're into snobbery, stay at the Hiatt down the street."
65,714,"Aug 6 2005	great staff good value	I've traveled the world and can only do so because I do it on a budget and I love the Edward Lear. My criteria is clean, safe. friendly and economical. I have found this little hotel a great value for the money. My room has always been clean and adequate...not fancy, but not shabby either. Last year was the third time I stayed there and I will take my granddaugter to London in 07 and hope to stay there again. The staff is wonderfully helpful and knowledgeable with any questions about London, getting around etc. I was going to tube it to the airport when they informed me I could cab it for less money (not to mention the hassel!) The first time I stayed was 20 years ago and I must say it has not had much updating since then but the price has not wildly increased either.Great restaurants nearby, felt very safe even as a woman alone in early evening, close to tube and shopping. The breakfast was very good each time I was there, lots of choice and well-prepared. Met interesting people who also choose this little oasis away from home over and over as I do. I've read the bedbug comments and am sure if some tourist brought bugs to the hotel they have rectified the problem. You can't search people as they enter and it can happen to any hotel. Could the carpet use a cleaning? Yes as in most places, but the beds are VERY clean. As for carrying luggage up steps...that is nothing unusual in small hotels in Europe. These are OLD buildings, many are converted homes. If you are looking for elegance and pampering....spend another 100 pounds and go elsewhere....if you are looking for clean, adequate, friendly, safe, Edward Lear is a good value."
66,714,"Jul 20 2005 	Don't believe the bad stuff	I lived at the Ed Lear Hotel for TWO months, due to an unfortunate incident at the flat I was supposed to live in. They gave me an excellent price per night. My room was always clean and bed was always made. I never saw and bugs at all in my room, and I have never even seen a fly come into my room. Being as though the hotel is in an old home, there is no elevator, but I managed to climb to the top floor for my stay there. For the price of this hotel and the location it is at, it is the best. My first week in London I stayed at a four star hotel that was less than four star in my opinion and ridiculously overpriced. The TV is small, but why go to London if you are going to watch TV all the time. The food was okay, and they always allowed me to take ceral up to my room, as much as I wanted. The showers are fine. The toliets are fine. The hotel smelled of cigarettes on the first floor, but people do smoke over here. The internet access was fine, and being as though it was free I wasn't going to comlain about the speed. I never had a problem with hot and cold water, since it isn't too hard to figure out what was hot and what was cold. The location is amazing, and for the price (I only had to pay 33 a night) I think the value is amazing."
67,714,"Jul 18 2005	Charming and affordable	This hotel was one of the few we could find with a central location, a private bath, and less than 100 pounds in July. We were quite happy there, but it isn't for everyone.Good points-Very helpful and friendly desk staff. Decent size room, clean, nice long tub. We asked for a quiet location and that is what we got- a room facing a side street so we could sleep with windows open. About 3 blocks to the tube or bus stops (Marble Arch). Neighborhood feels safe- I could walk to parks and tree-lined streets, also close to shopping/ restaurants. Huge and tasty breakfast included. Free internet (15 minute limit, slow connection, so don't count on doing much more than quick emails).Bad points-Lumpy bed. Bath and walls show age (cracks, etc.- part of the character, nothing functional). Steep stairs.Conclusion-If you don't mind a hotel that shows its age a bit, this is a very good value. If you prefer modern and sleek, you won't like it."
68,714,"Jun 4 2005	Depends on your expectations	A few things first... You're not going to get much for your money in London no matter where you stay. Many hotels in London are old houses/townhouses/or buildings that have been converted into a hotel, thus not all rooms are the same size. You're in a big city, therefore there will be street noise even with &quot;double glazed&quot; windows. Once you get past those things and accept them, this is not such a bad place to stay. My wife and I were happy here for the 3 days we were in London. The hotel itself is cute, and looks nice from the outside with plants and flowers arranged nicely. The buildings surrounding it however, were not as picturesque. Location was convenient, very close to Hyde Park, shopping, and the underground. We got room 28, which was more than roomy. I can see though, that this place is a hit or miss kind of hotel depending on what room you get. You could luck out like we did, or you could get stuck in a broom closet. Service was very good. Our room was serviced each day, the front desk was very helpful storing our luggage for the day after we checked out, and breakfast was very good. The toilet was a up half a flight of stairs from our room, but we didn't mind. We never saw any others use it, and never had to wait or anything. The bath/shower in our room was fine. The shower consists of a shower head hanging on a cord rather than one fixed to the wall. So, this place was great for our needs. If you are coming to London expecting to get anything resembling an American hotel (in terms of what you get for your money), you're not going to like most hotels. This place is one of the more economical choices, and we found it to be clean, quaint, and adequate."
69,714,"Apr 13 2005	Legendary Service	This hotel is a perfect fit for those of you visiting London. Not only was the place beautiful as well as immaculant, but the customer service was far above and beyond the average expectation. The staff is very welcoming, knowledgable and courteous. The food.....FANTASTIC!!!I highly recommend this hotel to those of you who are interested in travel through London. They make their customers feel comfortable with the relaxing environment and exceptionally clean establishment at extremely low rates."
70,714,"Mar 18 2005	Edward Lear Hotel was Gross!!!	We had planned to stay at the Edward Lear Hotel for 1 night while we were in London. When we checked in we recieved room 1A which is right next to the reception desk, so we could hear everything that everyone outside of our room was saying. As we got into our room the first thing we noticed was that there was a shower in the middle of the room on top of what looked like a man made box that was painted black. THere was not even tile around it, it was dirty inside and the shower head was laying on the floor! THen was noticed that the carpet looked like it had never been cleaned. It was suppose to be red, but was black all around the edges of the room! Then when we sat on the bed for some reason the comforter was damp/wet. Then my friend tried to use the toilet only to find out that there was actually directions on how to use it and even when we followed the directions it still did not work!!! When we decided that we could not stay there, it took them almost an hour to turn the phone on so that we could make other arrangments. Also there was a sign in our room that said they were not responsible for anything that we left in our room while we were out. And to top it all off when we tried to check out of our room no more than 1 hour after we had checked in, they refused to give us any of our money back!!!"
71,714,"Mar 8 2005	Budget character and location	We had to downgrade once we got to London due to some unexpected banking issues. We went to the Edward Lear because of price. This place is cute! So much character. Positives: close to the tube, close to great diners and shops. Negatives: thin walls, small tvs, bathrooms outside of room, bed uncomfortable. If you are going to London to sightsee, consider it. It truly is a great deal if you are just looking for a room. A romantic weekend--don't stay here. If you don't mind buying a tube day pass to head into Soho for activities, this is a great spot with simply a bed and a fairly clean bathroom. No frills, great for students."
72,714,"Feb 28 2005	Don't stay here!	My advise would be to avoid this hotel and spend a few extra pounds if you have to, because that's what I'll be doing next time. In my quest for a reasonably priced quad in London (and it was a quest, I assure you), I came across this hotel. I figured, most of the reviews were good, with a couple of exceptions, so I guess it's fine. Plus, the price and location are good. So, I booked it. Well, I got back yesterday, and I don't think I've ever been so glad to leave a hotel as I was to leave the Edward Lear. Our ensuite hot water didn't work, despite some effort, and I was advised to use the adjacent hall shower, &quot;and if that doesn't work there's another one one floor down.&quot; Well, I was in the shower, my hair soaped up, and lo and behold, the water trickles down to nothing. So I had fun walking soaking wet and soapy to my room to rinse my hair in freezing water in a tiny room sink. The same gent who was purportedly &quot;fixing&quot; the water situation turned on the rad in the room, said it would be hot, and asked if we wanted it off. We said we did, but he didn't turn it off, so we roasted for the next two nights, and had to have the windows wide open. Every morning they screwed up our breakfast order - one day they gave our orders to people who had just sat down, then, after a few minutes, realized their mistake and snatched them back for us. How hygienic! And last but not least, there was the morning when the cleaning woman knocked on our door and asked if we needed anything. When I said we'd be gone in an hour, but could she make our beds then, she said something, obviously not understanding what I meant, at which point I realised she was not an English speaker, and gave up. Who asks if you want a made-up bed? Hello! Just assume that you make up beds at a hotel! All in all, my worst experience at a hotel EVER, and I've been all over the world in lots of hotels, from a two dollar room in Southern Thailand to the some gorgeous five stars in Europe, North America, and Asia. Yuck!!!"
73,714,"Jan 16 2005	loved the edward lear	october 2004, heard about the edwardlear through a friend who had stayed there the previous year. the cost was very reasonable for central london. the hotel was clean although not fancy. the cooked breakfast was a wonderful start to afun day of shopping in oxford street (1block away). the hotel staff were helpful, gave good advise on where to go what to see, they actually went out of their way to be helpful. many pubs and resturants were in walking distance. there were no elevators or porters so going upstairs with luggage was definatly a hassle. but for price and location well worth it. i will stay there again"
74,714,"Jan 5 2005	Definately returning	After being born and bred in the Hospitality Industry I decided to stay in a B&amp;B to escape the hustle and bustle of larger hotels. (I manage a hotel in Malata).One of my colleauges recommended the Edward Lear and I found the staff warm and enthusiastic , my room comfortable and clean and to top it off a hearty English breakfast. Due to my position I always browse through Trip Advisor and was shocked to read sone negative reviews and I might add even 5 star hotels have the unfortunate problems of these Bed Bugs as they are actually brought in by an unknowing customer. So please do not let negative reports put uou off this fantastic little B&amp;B. I will definately be returning as will my own customers and co-workers.Keep up the good work Edward Lear."
75,714,"Jan 4 2005	warm and friendly	We have just return from London. It was so nice to stayed in the Edward Lear Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helptfull and nothing was to much trouble.

76,714,"Dec 23 2004	Good buy great location will return	We stayed here 6 nights in March and found the hotel a great buy for the money. It's not 5 star and doesn't claim to be.Our room (AND BATHROOM) was clean, breakfast good, staff helpful... and ceratinly NO BUGS! The computer was a bit dicey, but there is a sister hotel a few blocks away where you can go and use theirs at no cost. (Don't recall the Dorchester offers free internet connection, so what do you want?)We'll stay there again, you can't beat the location anywhere near this price!"
77,714,"Sep 18 2004	good value for money	I just returned from my trip to London. I always check reviews on tripadvisor before travelling anywhere and am now surprised with what I read about the Edward Lear! I had a very pleasant stay and would recommend it to anyone. I chose the Edward Lear Hotel due to its great location. It was my first trip to London and I wanted to be close to tourist attractions. Upon my arrival I found the hotel very cosy looking and could feel a friendly atmosphere when I walked into it. I chose to stay in a standard single room and knew that there was no private bathroom. My room was located on the top floor and there was no lift so this put me off a little bit, but once I got to the room I felt comfortable and safe. Even though it is in central London it was very quiet and relaxing. The decoration was a little bit old fashion and needd updating, but the room was kept clean and I received a room service on daily basis. The hotel's staff was very friendly and helpful. I got great advise on how to get to different places what saved me quite a bit of money. Breakfast was excellent, trditional English breakfast and lighter option that included cereal, juices and toast. All included in the price. I was also pleased to see that there is some renovation work going on.I would definately stay there again, especially when travelling on my own as I found this cute hotel a very safe and comfortable. Good value for money."

2,715,"Nov 25 2009 	Great Find Convenient location nice atmosphere very expensive phone calls though	I had stayed at the hotel in the past and have been very satisfied. the rooms are nice and comfortable. Great location near Harrods, nice staff. Fun bar (great for nightcaps). Good breakfast buffet. Free Wifi (in room too). The bed is very comfortable, nice touches include lighted candle at night in rrom, adequate lighting (although bedlights could be improved). I was very disappointed by the charges of 3 pounds per call from the room phone, for any outside call (even if tool free, free phone or credit card call). This is not clearly advertised, and in any event is a vastly excessive charge. For instance, if you make 10 external calls and you bill them to your telephone card, you will still pay 30 pounds to the Hotel, plus the actual call charges. Use skype or your cell phone instead!"
3,715,"Nov 6 2009 	A wedding night in heaven	We originally planned to just have a special wedding 'high tea' at this hotel, but based on their fantastic service and friendliness we decided to spend our wedding night there. It was one of the biggest highlights of the day. (Apart from the &quot;i do's&quot; of course)The hotel staff is beyond fantastic. We came back to a hotel room covered in rose pedals and tea lights. The rooms are beautiful and every detail is considered. Every one (without exception) of our guests that was with us at the high tea commented on how amazing the hotel was and how friendly everyone there is. My husband and myself have already decided instead of anniversary gifts we will spend our wedding anniversary night in this hotel every year."
4,715,"Oct 6 2009 	Perfect Location But Tiny Room	Staying at this hotel is like being in a private residence just steps from the main street where you'll find Harrod's, the Victoria and Albert Museum, et. al. And the staff couldn't be better. However, the room we had was tiny. Since it wasn't the cheapest room, we were a little surprised. There was really no room to walk from the bed to the closet. For your clothes, there were a few of the narrowest drawers that you might put handkerchiefs in plus a few shelves that were unreachable unless you stood on a chair. The room would be OK for solo business travelers, which the hotel seemed to attract. If I were going to London alone, this would be the perfect hotel. You would feel comfortable eating alone or having a drink alone at the charming bar. And the staff is wonderful beyond words.Now, if they could only make those rooms a bit larger..."
5,715,"Sep 25 2009 	Best staff of any hotel we've had the pleasure to visit!!	My wife and I just finished a weeks stay at the Edgertown House Hotel. The physical plant of the hotel itself is superb. The public areas are beautifully decorated and very functional. Our room was also very tastefully decorated, comfortable and equipped with all of the amenities. That said, however, the most salient feature of this hotel is the outstanding staff. We had stayed in many fine hotels and resorts but I would have to say that the staff at this hotel are the best we have ever encountered. It is obvious that the management here strives to select staff members who truly care about their guests. Each of the staff persons we encountered went out of their way to welcome us, make us comfortable during our stay and to assist us, in every way, in making our trip to London a wonderful experience."
6,715,"Sep 22 2009 	EGERTON HOUSE EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY	My recent three night stay at the Egerton House Hotel was exceptional in every way. The staff are incredibly professional, positive, dedicated and hard-working. They deal with a very difficult airline for three days to help retrieve my baggage. This allowed me to see what I could of London. The food is exceptional and the room and dining room service is excellent. The bedroom was spacious; the bathroom a joy in space and amenities. The Egerton is within walking distance of much of London or a very short taxi away from other districts. The staff are attentivew without being intrusive. They made my Red Carnation Hotel stay perfect in every detail...I consider the Egerton House Hotel my 'home' in London, UK."
7,715,"Sep 13 2009 	WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	My girlfriend and I stayed at the wonderful Egerton in September we had a room on the 3rd floor, the room was traditional in Style but the Hotel is very 21st century. The service is wonderful, staff are efficient and friendly. We were made to feel at home and they looked after us so well that we were sad to leave.We recommend this fantastic hotel to anyone who appreciate over and above a good service, attention to detail and glamorous 5*+ surroundings in one of the best parts of London!"
8,715,"Sep 4 2009 	Superb Hotel Superb Staff and Superb Location	This is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, and as a seasoned traveller I would definitely recommend this hotel.The decor is sumptuous and our room was absolutely beautiful and very comfortable. But best of all, the staff and service is truly outstanding. Everyone was genuinely friendly and so helpful with their recommendations for day trips out, getting taxis, making restaurant reservations. I really value great service above anything else, but here you have both. We will definitely come back to this hotel on our next trip to London. I cannot fault it. I rarely write reviews but our stay here was so great I feel compelled to share this.... Oh and make sure you have the afternoon tea! It's a must."
9,715,"Aug 26 2009 	Rip-off...	Like somebody else said, how did this get in as nr. 1 in London??Yes, its great location, good service and so on. But here are the catches:- STIFF price for extremly small rooms (250  per night), and we went for the middle size..- The cleaning crew left our garbage for 3 days; noe trash bin was cleaned out, champagne and glasses that was 3 days old wasn't taken away, fruit for 3 days was just sitting there with small flies over it- They removed the headcover to the bathtub, and I wouldn't have normally expected it, but when we first got it, I didn't expect them to take it away- The breakfast room is so small it was hard not to get claustrophobic. The waiter forgot about us the first day, and we just sat there. And we were in a hurry.. PS. The waiter wasn't there....- When you are welcomed and shown the room, our concerigies was not very warm, but more superficial and you could really feel he was just saying the things he had been thought, but didn't care for it at all.. That was a big disappointment- Stiff prices for the pay tv (even though the room is VERY overprized)They gave us a champagne as a greeting when we arrived, due to engagment, that was very nice! But, overall, I want my money back..."
10,715,"Aug 3 2009 	A little gem in Knightsbridge that I highly recommend	I'm not usually one to write reviews, but the Edgerton House Hotel in Knightsbridge really is something very special. I live in Australia and am a seasoned traveller and as a result of my occupation I travel internationally on a regular basis and stay in many beautiful hotels. The hotel was recommended to my partner and I by friends and I must say this glamorous little hotel had the biggest personality and charm by far of any hotels I have stayed at! The tiniest details were really thought of from the beautiful fabric wall cover, marble bathroom and white orchids. We had everything we could possibly need, the staff were very friendly and professional and most importantly helpful. Nothing was ever trouble and they went out of their way to tend our every need. It would have been lovely to spend another week as we really did thoroughly enjoy it. We will definitely come back in the future and highly recommend this hotel to everyone."
11,715,"Aug 3 2009 	Efficient and excellent	I recently discovered the Egerton, the location is superb and the hotel is beautiful, it is charming and the rooms are nicely decorated. But I am here to tell you about the staff and the service. It is and deserves to be NO1. friendly, efficient and consistent, they took care of all my requests and made my stay comfortable and memorable.I returned to my company and ask them to recommend this hotel to all of our colleagues and will recommend it to anyone! I look forward to returning in September."
12,715,"Aug 1 2009 	Don't know how the Egerton got to #1 on Trip Advisor	I was completely misled by the Reservation staff (Yorrick). I was promised the best suite in the hotel. Two bedrooms with ONE toilet, not pleasant with two teenagers. When I asked Reservation why they didn't inform me about the toilet, they said that &quot;it was not their job to make people aware of the negative aspects of the accomodation&quot;. I was due to spend the last night of our European holiday in London and cancelled the Egerton and stayed at 47 Park Street. It was similarly priced and litorally, 10 times as nice. I would highly recommend the latter hotel."
13,715,"Jul 30 2009 	Travel with my family	My wife, daughter and i recently stayed at the wonderful Egerton, each time we come to London. We stay there, the service is exceptional, consistent and the staff are simply wonderful and friendly, it is a truly remarkable hotel. Thank you Egerton for always making our London trip a memorable one!We will see you soon and recommend you to everyoneOzlem-Canan-Atacan"
14,715,"Jul 30 2009 	Briliant Staff beautiful Hotel	I recently stayed at this Beatiful hotel with my girlfriend, This was on first time as two young adults staying in London.The hotel is not only beautiful, but the staff are lovelly and extrenly friendly.Everyone looked after us and spoiled us.Wonderful , Wonderful, Wonderful........."
15,715,"Jul 30 2009 	A luxurious haven with staff that make you feel like family	Both myself and my wife have stayed in many hotels around the world but we have yet to be made feel more welcome or more comfortable than we were here. None of the stuffiness you would expect of a hotel of this calibre, the place oozes charm, the staff go out of their way to help you and think of what you might need before you do. The candlelit turndown of our room at night was so thoughtful and the bar with Antonio at the helm has a mix of locals and guests that is always entertaining. This hotel is the complete opposite to box chain hotels and our king sized bedroom with original high ceilings was perfectly turned out. If staying in an 18th Century townhouse, in an aristocratic neighbourhood where your every wish is taken care of quickly and efficiently and above all with charm, then this is the place for you. We will definitely be back."
16,715,"Jul 23 2009	Great hotel but ....	I chose this hotel because of it's No1 ranking on Trip Advisor. My expectations were therefore very high. Yes the service is wonderful, and the bed fantastic, and the attention to detail superb. And the hotel did give us access to our room at 7.30 am, for which we were very grateful. BUT there are some issues - whilst in a quiet street, you do get some traffic noise from 6am from Brompton Road, though the person taking my booking assured me that there was no traffic noise ( please note that I am particularly sensitive to noise) My daughter could not unpack her bag, as the cupboard space was small (though this may not be the case in other rooms, though we had one of the largest rooms); you could hear the people walking in the room above and the people watching TV in the room next door ( though they were reprimanded by the staff as the volume was on extremely high )...and finally the bathroom shower ( shower in bath) is not the best . Having said all of this we did have a wonderful stay at the hotel - and I would recommend it for its location, bed and service."
17,715,"Jul 19 2009 	Magic Martini Superb Singing Spectacular Service and a Stunning Hotel	My wife and I enjoyed two nights at the Egerton House Hotel on 16th &amp; 17th July. Although we arrived late our welcome was wonderful and we were shown to our room (43).The room is one of the smaller ones in the hotel but offered plenty of room for our cases, work items etc and most importantly enough space to get ready and relax.The dcor is stunning, designed to the highest quality and very tasteful. The bathroom was full of Penhaligon products, soft towels, slippers and robes.We ordered room service and enjoyed calamari (7/10) and rump steak (10/10).Next morning we had a breakfast meeting and were looked after by super efficient staff. By super efficient I mean we didnt have to wait for plates to be cleared, teapots to be refreshed or food to be served. It just happened with grace and style  very nice.We worked outside of London for the day and arrived back just in time for a quick drink before getting ready for dinner. I could write pages about the experience in The Egerton bar but lets just say its worth a stay just to experience Antionio and his performance!Enjoying a Gin &amp; Tonic and a beer was fun but the real show began a little later when we went back to back to the bar for a pre dinner Martini.We met with two friends, found a corner in the exquisite lounge, Anotino arrived and the show began. I say show because this is no normal Martini experience. Ill leave it there because like a film review you dont want me to reveal the plot but Id give the performance an Oscar (and you couldnt drink more than one!).Then just when we thought it couldnt get better we were introduced to Alex. He was known to us as the very polite and efficient young man who checked us in the night before. But for five minutes he left his post came over to our table and sang  and boy can he sing. His operatic performance was extraordinary  shivers down my spine and open mouthed stunned responses from our guests.We enjoyed dinner at a restaurant a few minutes away (there a dozens on the doorstep) before heading back to the bar for a night cap  or two.Saturday morning breakfast was relaxed and with the service open until 11 there was no hurry (we were still sat with papers and coffee at 11.45). Our stay was completed with a visit to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum which is only a five minutes walk from the hotel. At the time of writing Edgerton House is the No1 Hotel in London on Trip Advisor  well deserved and well judged."
18,715,"Jul 15 2009 	Absolutely wonderful hotel!	I've visited many luxury hotels through my line of work, and must say that the Egerton House Hotel is by far one of the best! The rooms have incredibly charming decor and are quite comfortable and spacious for a boutique hotel. But what really stands out are the employees and level of service. I traveled with six other family members who all arrived at the hotel on different days. Though we were all first-time visitors, the front desk staff welcomed us as if we were regular guests. Each staff member went out of their way to help answer any questions we had and assist with anything we needed during our stay. We adore Beatriz! Don't forget to visit Antonio in the bar - his martinis are not to be missed!Thanks to the wonderful staff for taking such great care of us!"
19,715,"Jul 14 2009 	An excellent hotel with great staff and attentive service.	The Egerton House Hotel is a hotel that we use regularly when staying in London. The staff and service is fantastic and I regularly recommend this hotel to friends, colleagues and business associates."
20,715,"Jun 30 2009 	London at it's best	We just spent ten days there the second time and it was delightful.Leaving with hugs from the wait staff made one think of childhood at my aunts.Pampered, is the one word that best describes our stay.Celebrated our fiftieth anniversary with our son and grandsons."
21,715,"Jun 29 2009 	Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough	I recently stayed here with my partner to celebrate our engagement. The hotel was beautiful - lovely room, lovely atmosphere. We were greeted very warmley at the reception and shown round the hotel in a friendly but relaxed way,. We were given afternoon tea which was fantastic, a free drink in the bar and then bottles of water when we left on the sunday morning to get us through the day.Could not have a better time if we had stayed anywhere else, a lovely place with fantastic staff."
22,715,"Jun 29 2009 	Thank you Egerton House Hotel!	The fact that I have lived in this building for 3 years and can't tell you the name of my doorman but I can name two managers, Sandra and Murat. As well as the personal favorite of my sons and father, Antonio, the barman should tell you something. This is a truly five star experience delivered with the friendly smile at every turn. We did not know London at all, and they were helpful from beginning to end. I cannot thank you enough for making our stay with you guys so enjoyable."
23,715,"Jun 26 2009 	Fantastic Little Hotel in London	I used Trip Advisor to search for hotels in London and came across this one. It absolutely surpassed our expectations. Rooms are beautiful, extremely clean, bathroom is great size and very functional and decor is fantastic. Location is wonderful. Very close to Khnightsbridge, yet in a very nice quiet little street. We took a package that included afternoon tea and it was stunning. The afternoon tea and little bar are probably the best I have ever been to. Staff is friendly and ready to help you with anything you need (tickets, taxis, etc.). We had a great time and would definitely come back to this hotel next time we are in London."
24,715,"Jun 20 2009 	We've found our hotel in London!	Every year for the past 14 years my husband and I have traveled to London on business,mixed with leisure. We've only stayed at the same hotel twice(and the last time the hotel had gone down) Last fall we stayed at the Egerton. What a fabulous hotel! Everything was perfect--the personable staff, the tasteful rooms,the service and of course, Antonio's martinis! It's in a very nice and convenient area. We've already booked our stay again this fall. At last we've found &quot;our place&quot;."
25,715,"Jun 7 2009 	Just Perfect	My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Egerton House. The stay was just perfect. The room wasEuropean small but not tiny. The furnishings were elegant and the service was impeccable. The staff could not do too much. Don't miss the delicious breakfast. Plenty to do in the area, walk to the V&amp;A Museum and Harrods. This hotel was beyond our expectations."
26,715,Jun 2 2009 	Wonderful stay at wonderful venue	Excellent weekend stay at this beautiful hotel in the heart of London. The staff were superb and Antonio's Martini's were out of this world! I would highly recommend looking out for this hidden gem.
27,715,"Jun 1 2009 	Your own personal luxurious London mansion....	Spent a couple of days at the Edgerton House hotel. It was fabulous. one of the best locations in London - it feels like you are in the country, but still a stone's throw from Harrods. The staff are wonderful - always attentive and friendly. The hotel is small and cosy and has the atmosphere of a (very luxurious) private home. I will definitely be back!"
28,715,Mar 26 2009 	One of the great hotels of London	This place is a must. It's small and rooms are by no means spacious. But the service is top notch. Teh bartender makes great drinks. You have such a great location yet it's quiet and peaceful. It's not cheap. But it's worth the money. The front desk couldn't have been more helpful. We shipped our golf clubs to the hotel and then up to Scotland and they organized everything with a smile. One of the few hotels we have stayed at where I couldn't think of one thing that wasn't perfect.
29,715,"Mar 25 2009 	Lovely stay! Excellent hotel!	I just spent the weekend at the Egerthon house hotel with my girlfriends and we certainly recommend the hotel to everyone.Mr. Conradie, the head concierge, had booked for us in advance musical tickets and a nice restaurant for the Saturday evening. The staff was wonderful and kind. Our deluxe rooms had a lots of space and the beds were fabulous. We of couse tasted the famous martinis that they make in the cosy bar. Our weekend was wonderful and this hotel will be our address for the next London trip as well. All great shopping and Harrods were just 5 minutes from the hotel."
30,715,"Mar 9 2009 	Excellent Service from a Friendly Staff	We have now stayed twice at the Egerton House. It did not surprise me to learn that a large percentage of its customers are repeat business. The location is central (close to two tube stops on different lines) and within a few blocks of major shopping and museum attractions. But what makes the Egerton so good is its wonderful, friendly, dedicated staff. The hotel has only 20 something rooms so the staff quickly learns your name and is eager to help in making arrangements, giving advice and directions and getting you a drink or a cup of tea. The martinis made by Antonio the bartender are as good as everyone says. But even better is the feeling that you are staying at a home rather than a hotel. My partner and I are picky hotel consumers. We have been delighted with the Egerton and look forward to returning there. It is pricey, but if you can splurge it is worth it."
31,715,"Mar 2 2009 	Superb experience	I've been at Egerton for a whole week in business, and it was a s-u-p-e-r-b experience. A truly home away from home. Professional and amazing staff, excellent location, rooms are warm, comfortable, incredible mattresses (I have a neck hernia and for the first time in weeks I did not wake up with pains). The bathrooms are spacious an luxurious, the shower is powerful and the little touch of the candle by the bath tub in the evening for a relaxing bath was just great. You can say the bathroom is deeply cleaned every time housekeeping comes to make up your room. Not a single plate, glass, towel, carpet had a spot. The kitchen is remarkable as well. From breakfast to sandwiches, salads, all freshly and lightly prepared, being in London, a city with great restaurants, we just ate at the hotel almost every night because the food, the service and the atmosphere were just perfect. Antonio at the bar is a truly entertainer, he is incredible, always happy, never forgets an order while selecting great music we all appreciated.Free wi-fi in all hotel. And if you love shopping Harrods is just steps from Egerton.Im a travel agent who had been to many many hotels in the world, and I can assure you I almost felt sad when I left Egerton. It was the best choice I made in years. Thank you Sandra. Will recommend Egerton always and I cannot wait to come back. Choose Egerton without doubts!"
32,715,"Mar 1 2009 	Happy Happy Happy	My wife and I spent Valentines weekend here and have to say everything was perfect.The staff at receiption were fantastic. I particularily liked the way they rang a couple of days before I arrived to check if there was a restaurant or show we would like to book.The room was perfect, the late check out fantastic. I also really enjoyed a nightcap in the bar and meeting the barman is a must."
33,715,"Jan 28 2009 	Egerton Paradise	For our first time in London, we have stayed at the Egerton House Hotel, a luxury hotel nearby to Museums, Harrods, and Hyde Park Corner.The staff was very friendly and helpful and our room was absolutely stunning! We really love this small cosy hotel, we even spent one day staying in (famous Londons weather is not a myth), but it was one of the best days for us in England! We enjoyed Wall-E on TV with delicious popcorn (unfortunately bought this DVD day before, didnt know they have all last movies on TV), fantastic Bellinis in the bar and huge Club Sandwich in our room. I recommend this hotel to everyone who plan to have first class service stay in London!!!We can't wait to come back in our second English home!"
34,715,"Jan 4 2009	A Christmas to be remembered	As the title says it all, this was certainly one of the most unique and pleasant experiences we've enjoyed so far. We've been guests at many of London's most popular hotels however none compared to the Egerton's perfection in every aspect of it's accommodation and service.From the moment my partner and I met Graham, the butler who collected our luggage from the car, we knew that our stay was going to be amazing; and we indeed were swept off our feet throughout the entire journey. From the bar's cosy yet jazy atmosphere to the room's sublime design, we were short for words. The reception staff were very attentive to all of our needs and marvelled us with Christmas gifts on the 25th!!! We were recommended to dine at the Cheneston's restaurant at the Milestone Hotel, which is part of their collection, and were treated like royalty.Overall, this was simply amazing and we shall not fail to return very soon to celebrate our anniversary. To the staff of the Egerton: Thank you ever so much for this experience and we hope to see every single one of you very soon!"
35,715,Dec 28 2008 	A birthday treat	Amazing hotel. I took my fiance there for her birthday. The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. The room was clean and luxurious. I recommend a visit to the hotel bar where we were treated to some excellent cocktails and delicious snacks from the bar tender. I arranged for some romantic treats to be delivered to the room which all arrived on time and to a great standard. Cant wait to visit again.
36,715,"Nov 3 2008 	Sumptuous Stay in Knightsbridge	We arrived out of the freezing cold rain into the sumptuous Egerton House Hotel, where the reception area had a wonderful blazing fire burning in the grate. The receptionist was so welcoming and wafted us upstairs into a gorgeous room, just stuffed with furniture. It was amazing! We felt so cossetted. There were gorgeous chocolates awaiting us, and a copy of the Evening Standard. We went downstairs for a pre dinner drink and the drawing room also had a roaring fire. We ordered martinis, to kick start our evening out, and they have got to be the best we have ever tasted!We went out to a big event, and a 'butler' hailed a cab and made it all seem so easy, being in the big city. When we returned later, we slept so well in the big cosy bed, it was bliss. The next morning we awoke to birds singing - we hadn't realised there was a private garden and our room looked out onto it. We went downstairs for a piping hot cooked breakfast, served by a smiling waiter. I must say the whole experience was superb. We don't get up to London very often, but I want to come more often now I've discovered The Egerton House."
37,715,Nov 2 2008 	Great London Hotel	We have stayed at The Egerton House a number of times in the past. The hotel has since been renovated to perfection and is now part of a small chain called Red Carnation. The place is a jewel box and the staff and location make it a wonderful experience. It is in Knightsbridge just off Brompton Road with great tube and bus service to Piccadillly and the West End. We had a fabulous stay! It can't be beat for value and comfort.
38,715,"Oct 12 2008 	Paradise in London	Arriving at Egerton House was like arriving in paradise. We were fascinated by the fantastic location, really felt at home in the tastefully furnished rooms and enjoyed the excellent breakfast and hotel service. Very friendly staff gave us valuable tips of places to visit which you wouldn't find in an ordinary guide.Coming back from our exciting discovery tours felt like coming home, we found Egerton much more personal than many larger hotels."
39,715,"Oct 11 2008 	Our stay to the egerton	We have stayed to the Egerton house hotel for our first experience in London and I have to admit that I was really impressed with the fabulous surrounding, the friendly atmosphere and the excellent service provided by the staff members.We are looking forward to go back again and we definitely recommend this lovely experience. Pascale"
40,715,"Oct 10 2008	impressive	the Egerton House Hotel was the right choice for me. I just can say: I am impressed. the hotel is so familiar and comfortable and the House Hotel is located in nearly the best area of london; harrods, hyde parc etc. I really recommend this hotel with the fantastic and traditional furnishings."
41,715,Sep 20 2008 	A pearl in the centre of London	The Egerton House Hotel is a pearl in the centre of London!The services are excellent and the personnel are so helpful and cheerful and they do the best in order to make you feel like home.The rooms are extremeley clean and big and they are provided by everything you need during your stay in London.The hotel has also a nice bar where in a warm atmosphere it is possible to enjoy a awesome drink prepared by an expert bartender. We will definitely book the hotel again in the future.
42,715,"Sep 4 2008 	tasteful elegant simply the best	My husband and I along with my 20 year old son and his girlfriend have recently returned from a stay at Egerton House Hotel. Quite simply this is a home away from home. We have already booked our stay for next year. The location is fantastic, so close to harrods, hyde park and all the shops of knightsbridge. Service at the hotel is first class, the food excellent, the lounge and bar area so comfortable and inviting. Each day we would return from our outings and go straight to the lounge for drinks or cup of tea. Its is such a welcoming place to stay. We had adjoining rooms, one standard and one grand deluxe. No attention to details was spared. Hot water bottles, bath pillows, a candle at turn down service, the list goes on. The rooms, as is the whole hotel, are beautifully decorated. This hotel ticks all the right boxes for us and also for the 20 year olds. This is no mean feat as I find fault. We have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on Hyde Park and the Dorchester. Much prefer the intimacy of Egerton House. It is five star first class through and through and we look forward to our next visit in july 2009."
43,715,"Aug 13 2008 	Highly recommended	My wife and I have just enjoyed a delightful 3 night stay at this small and welcoming hotel. I have to sdmit to having been horrified at the price of hotels in the UK but having drunk sufficiently to overcome the pain I booked this hotel on the strength of previous reviews. I have no regrets.From the welcome when we arrived, to the delightful room and helpful staff this was a great hotel, very tastefully and opulently decorated but with a personal and intimate feel.We will be returning."
44,715,"Jun 11 2008 	Great Rooms Service and Location!	We have stayed at this hotel a number of times while visiting London, both before and after it's ownership change and consequent upgrade. We treasure it, both because of it's very lovely rooms, its quiet location, the GREAT service of its staff, and its most convenient location, i.e., a 5 minute walk from Harrods and a few minutes more to either the Knightsbridge or South Kensington tube stations. Additionally, there are many very good restaurants within easy walking distance. We highly recommend it,"
45,715,Jun 1 2008	Simply stunning with outstanding service	A 5+ star experience! A magnificent hotel in the perfect location in London. Everything was outstanding. We were particularly impressed with the service. They really made our whole London experience one we will never forget. Thank you Egerton House Hotel. We strongly recommend this fine hotel to anyone visiting London.
46,715,"Feb 20 2008 	Unforgettable Valentine's	This is the second time my husband and I visit the Capital. The first time was 10 years ago and things have changed a lot ever since. It was already a fairly difficult task to find the right hotel for our stay, but we decided to make the effort, as we really wanted to treat ourselves for our 20th Valentines together. After a few hours browsing online, I found the &quot;Iprefer&quot; website (deluxe small properties around the world); and there was the Egerton, just what we were looking for. I have to say that we couldnt be happier with our choice. The service was fantastic, everyone in the hotel were so friendly and efficient!  In the evening of Valentines, I found out later, my husband had planned a surprise at the hotel for me, with the assistance from the staff at the Egerton. When we came back from the restaurant (recommended by Jacques, squeeze him for information on restaurants) we headed into the barAntonio the barman was just the best! Receptionists and housekeepers where in the meantime secretly arranging the surpriseHow was I to know that upstairs, in my suite, everything was being prepared, from candles in the bath, rose petals, strawberries, chocolates to soft music and (even more) champagne? As I walked into my room after one drink too many, I found the most romantic suite ever, what a delight! Thank you everyone at the Egerton for such an unforgettable experience! I will definitively come back, truly the best."
47,715,"Dec 1 2007 	Great hotel in Knightsbridge	My mom, sister (mid 20s), and I stayed here during our trip to London at the end of October. We had a fantastic stay. We arrived around 10am and were able to get into one of the rooms right away, even though check in is 2:00pm. We stayed in rooms 15 and 16 which are connected rooms via a small hallway with an outer door (which we were able to lock.) The rooms were great, Bose speakers for our Ipods, large TV, internet access, the ability to get on the web without a computer (although there was a free computer for use on the 4th floor.) The dcor was lovely and the beds incredibly comfortable. Every night when they turned down the bed, there was the requisite chocolate on the pillow , but also a lit candle in the bath, which were nice touches. Even though we were on the 1st floor (which is the 2nd floor in the States) there was no street noise to keep you awake in the evenings.The staff was very helpful and we loved the bar/sitting area with the great drinks provided by Antonio the barman. One evening, we even just had sandwiches for dinner while enjoying the fire and drinks.Location was great, Knightsbridge, just a couple blocks away from Harrods and almost across the street from the V&amp;A. Tube stop just 2-3 blocks away.We would definitely stay here again."
48,715,"Nov 5 2007 	Beautiful Quiet Luxury in Central London	We have just returned from a weekend in London, staying at the Egerton House Hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel. It is a small boutique hotel, not inexpensive but in a great location in close to Harrods/ Museums etc. The decor is superb and completely flawless. The rooms are small but beautifully furnished and most comfortable. The service was impeccable. We did not eat at the hotel (except for breakfast which was very nice). However, we did have drinks at the bar and again the ambience was lovely. We would strongly recommend this hotel, particularly for a romantic getaway to central London."
49,715,"Sep 19 2007 	Unbelievable Service	I have traveled the world and been (thanks to my various employers) to many great 5 star hotels in London, NY, Boston, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong etc.This is the first time that I have been blown away by the service at a hotel.Dropped off my luggage in the morning and when I got back at lunch to check into my room, they had already hung up all my suits.Reception staff welcomed me by name each time I walked in. The room is immaculate and includes free wifi, a Bose iPod docking station for my iPod, LCd TV in room and bathroom. and loads more.But again service, service, service.The bar in the Hotel.....great and discrete with Antonio making an unbelievable Martini and at 60 he has stories about De Niro, Oliver Reed and many more from his 44 year career as a barman in all the top hotels in London.$"
50,715,"Aug 31 2007 	The best staff ever!	All I can say about Egerton that this hotel is the one of the best hotels I ever stayed in before. Its not only about fantastic room where I stayed for a great price (for a centre of London!) with condition, unique decorations, yummy canaps and tea tray (free of charge!), its more about the best staff I ever meet. It other hotels it seems like they work just for a tips but not in Egerton - I had full directions to the best Londons signs, lot of advices where to go (like amazing restaurants (really cheap anyway!)), and all this was done not for a regular customer, it was just for me!Maybe Im a bit overreacting but I really had the best time in London with helps of Egerton staff! Thank you so much!"
51,715,"Jul 30 2007 	The nicest hotel I have ever stayed at	We arrived on a sunny afternoon in late July, via Paddington and Hyde Park. We were greeted at reception by ever-so-charming Jacques, shown our room (35) and were bowled over by everything - the air con, the wide screen TV, the plush four-poster bed, the beautiful antique furniture, the tasteful decor, the champagne on ice, floating candles, fresh flowers... It was all just one glorious experience. Despite its location, the hotel is uber peaceful, if you want it that way.Antonio's martinis were a little bit too potent for me and I headed off for sinner at Claridges with a fuzzy head, but there's no doubt he is charming and knows his stuff - a real repeat attraction for the hotel!Service was impeccable and breakfast was nice.Top marks Egerton! Seriously good stay, on a par with the W Hotel in Honolulu, which we also loved for many of the same reasons, including location."
52,715,"Jul 21 2007 	Functional	Three nights at the Egerton. This was my third stay at the Egerton. In the last few years, I have preferred to stay 200 yards away at the Franklin but it was being renovated. It appears the Egerton has changed hands. The hotel is extremely well located with regard to Belgravia and Knightsbridge, three blocks from Harrods, a block from the museums - just a great location. There are MANY wondeful London squares near by; this trip I visited 20 and came away entralled.The hotel itself is in good shape. Nice and helpful staff. I tipped the young landy that initially helped me a good bit because I was anticipating needing some help during the visit, and got wonderful attention. The room I had was on the third floor at the back of the hotel&gt; It was in a different style from most of the other rooms - almost like a dining club decor - a lot of paneling, etc. Well equipped and a great bathroom. The only problem was the door to the corridor which did not fit snuggly and some corridor noise came through. But this defect didn't cause any problem since most of the guests are quiet and respectable. The only slightly awkward staff problem I had was the day I left. Another young lady was very attentive - having heard, I am certain, that I had given her comrade a large tip. She escorted me to the taxi, etc. A bit overdone.I would skip the English breakfast at the hotel. It is very expensive and better value is available in many locations close to the hotel.Squares and neighborhoods top visit and enjoy are Egerton Crescent (just around the corner), Chester Square (near Eaton Square), Wilton Crescent, Belgrave Square, Montpelier Square, Pelham Crescent, Trevor Square - there are actually too many to mention, but one can have a very pleasant walk about this area and see many wondeful neighborhoods exhibiting a concern for privacy and decorum not seen in many urban world cities."
53,715,"Jul 15 2007	Exquisite stay in Knightsbridge	If you need to be in the Knightsbridge area of London, stay here. Remarkable service, fabulous breakfast (talk them into including it in your rate), and wonderful water pressure. Lovely, quiet area, yet near all sorts of great stuff."
54,715,May 28 2007 	Maybe the best hotel in London	This small hotel has a fabulous location in South Kensington close tothe Tube. It is the quietest hotel we've ever stayed in. I was there last year and the staff remembered me! Antonio the bartender is fabulous--stop down for a drink before going out for the evening. My only wish is that it was not so expensive.
55,715,"Mar 25 2007 	great martini's!	Stayed here recently on a weekend through recommendation of a collegue, very nice comfortable rooms, garden views, we had a room with a four poster bed, was truly amazing. The staff was really excellent, all very smiley and friendly. I loved antonio's martini's the best! Such a cosy bar and he is fabulous. Will definately come back."
56,715,"Mar 9 2007	home away from home	I am happy to read all the positive reviews because I also just love this hotel. It is small and cozy and you feel very welcome when you walk in. It is in a great location near Harrods and many other shops, but still quiet. I stayed several times. Last time I arrived late. And in my room there was a tray with little snacks, the music was one (you have an Ipod in your room). There was even a candle burning in the bathroom. I hope to be able to go back soon."
57,715,"Feb 19 2007 	This place gets everything right!	This was my fist opportunity to stay at The Egerton but friends have recommended it for years. Its a boutique hotel which has just been given a complete makeover, you gets lots of attention, the service, the location and the decor are awesome, its walking distance to all the good restaurants, shops, museums and parks. The rooms have everything you need including an ipod you can borrow and there are thoughtful touches like returning to find ice and canapes in your room every evening and candle lit turndowns, I stayed in a King Room which had high ceilings, lovely views and a bed so comfortable I didnt want to leave, Can't wait to come back, I've found my home in London. Muriel Denny, New York."
58,715,"Feb 15 2007 	The most wonderful stay in London	This is the most fabulous Hotel I've stayed in in a long time, love it and would recommend it to anyone! Great location, exceptional service, very cosy and beautifully decorated. Martinis &amp; especially Cosmopolitan by charming Antonio - the best in London, Full English breakfast was delicious and Front Desk staff recommended most wonderful restaurant for a romantic dinner nearby!Looking forward to my next stay"
59,715,"Feb 2 2007	Wonderful and cosy!	I really love this hotel. Have stayed at the Egerton many times. the staff are very friendly and the location is superb, close to museums as well as to shopping in Knightsbridge. The rooms I have stayed in have all been recently decorated in lovely warm colours. It's elegant but not stuffy. The bar is small but the bar man is really sweet and charming. Great cocktails too!"

1,721,"Nov 2 2009 	great location	I recently stayed here for three nights. I thought that the room was a good size for London, it was clean had a nice ensuite bathroom. The staff were polite. The best aspect of this hotel is its location.It is so close to Earl's Court station which is very well serviced by all tube lines. We didnt eat in the hotel but there are plenty of places around. Overall I was very happy with this hotel and would stay here again."
2,721,"Nov 1 2009 	Not what you would expect for a three star hotel!	The location is good - two minutes walk from the Earls Court tube station. The reception area, bar and restaurant are pleasantly modern but once you get to your room it's a different story. The rooms are tiny. We are a small/average sized couple but found that two people could not pass in the room: one had to sit on the bed to let the other pass. We were only staying for a weekend so had only a small suitcase between us - goodness only knows what you would have done if you had two large cases! There was just not enough space in the room!The bathroom was tiny: only a shower, wash basin and toilet. Fortunately, everything worked well, water was hot and everything was clean. However, the toilet seat was wonky and the toiletries were minimal. Even though it was the end of October, the room was unbearably hot. We had to open the windows and keep the ceiling fan on all night to make the temperature bearable! The radiators were NOTswitched on, but it felt like they were and even though the exterior temperatures were unseasonably warm, they were nothing exceptional so we couldn't work out why the room was so hot. In the summer it would be intolerable. Don't have breakfast in the hotel. It is expensive at 12.50 per head and the so called hot food is only lukewarm. So it definitely isn't worth it."
3,721,"Nov 1 2009 	Small rooms-not a great deal for the area	There are other hotels in the quiet area of earls court that offer with the same price range or a little bit more,defnitely more things to offer.rooms were terrible small,breakfasts is extra.The only good thing is its located 3 min from the tube."
4,721,"Oct 26 2009 	Avoid - not a nice hotel.	We stayed here by default - the hotel reserved had double booked our room and decided to transfer us to the Enterprise. It was really awful. Three beds crammed into the room - a double and two singles - none comfortable. Sub-standard out-dated fixtures and fittings, stained carpet and squeaky floor boards. The bathroom fan would only go off if the power supply was temporarily cut. Hot water came out of the cold tap and cold water came out of the hot tap? The main air-conditioning unit for the hotel was situated just outside our window which kicks in about every 40 mins through the night. The room was so hot we had to leave the window open all night. The view was terrible - pigeon poo-stained pipes complete with pigeons - I kid you not! Hot breakfast was luke-warm etc... Just what you need when you are seven and a half months pregnant! AVOID this place there are nicer hotels in London."
5,721,"Oct 24 2009 	Be warned!	We arrived on the monday afternoon. We walked into the hotel reception and saw a wonderful and modern marble reception which is exactly what we expected from the online photo's we had looked at before booking at this hotel. This is where the comparison ended! The receptionist ignored us for 5 minutes before finally welcoming us (if you can call it a welcome) to the hotel. I signed us in and we were told the room number and where the lift was. We worked out for ourselves which floor we were on and found our room (109). We walked into the room and rather than the flat screen, wall mounted TV and all the mod cons that were advertised online, we found what apeared to be a single room with 2 single beds pushed together in a room which was well overdue for updating with an old portable TV on a wall mounted stand which, if not carefull, you'd knock your head on getting out of bed. All the basics were provided (Tea/ Coffe facilities) and the room was clean, but there was a lack of the style that we were expecting. The room was so small that there wasn't enough room for both of us to walk around the bed at the same time. The en-suite shower room was small and had mix and match fittings (mostly mix!). The view out of our bedroom window consisted of 3 cables tied together with string and the contents of a used cigarette counter (including lighters and matches). On a positive, the hotel was only 2 minutes walk from the tube station which got us far away from the hotel in record time. All in all, I'd not recommend this hotel to anybody and would advise anybody that does book into this hotel to check the room number and facilities before confirming the booking."
6,721,"Oct 18 2009 	Huge disappointment! Small old rooms; awful staff!	Not where you want to stay! Hotel looks great from the outside as well as the lobby; however the room we got was the smallest Ive ever seen (and I stayed in NY few times:) with old furniture. Their official photos show something else, much bigger. I asked for another room but they showed me something even worse. The room was so little that we two (average weight persons) couldnt move at the same time, one had to sit on a very small bed while other went to toilet, which is on hand reach from the bed. Toilet so tiny and in bad shape that one couldnt close the door while using the sink. Bed linen and towels were clean but the blanket was very dirty. Location is great, 3 minutes from Earls Court tube where one can take tube to Heathrow for 3,4 pounds; but there are other hotels in the area to stay in. Internet access on the computer in the lobby is charged 2 pounds for 30 min but it is so slow that one can barely manage to open a map. When we complained we were told that one can not expect the speed like in a private home?! No comment."
7,721,"Sep 26 2009 	Solid pick with a good location	Well, this was our first trip to London, so we were unfamiliar with the area. The Enterprise had a great location - about a one block walk from the Earl's Court station with many convenience stores, local restaurants and quick places to grab a bite. We stopped at the &quot;Bakers Oven&quot; across the street from the Earl's Court station for coffee every morning. There is also a helpful internet cafe nearby in case you need to research or print something out.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We arrived too early to check in, so they allowed us to check-in our baggage, so we can tour the city until check-in time. The room was what we expected for a European trip - small with a bed, TV and bathroom. The room was very clean, so we were very happy about that. There was also a heater available but we didn't really need it. However, we did use the ceiling fan as we had a great warm weather while visiting.Overall, the hotel was solid for the price - we spent about $110 US dollars per night. The only things we would have wanted were some type of breakfast included - there was no continental breakfast at all - and it would have been good to have a safe to use in the room. We were able to lock a few things up in the hotel safe through the front desk for a fee though."
8,721,"Sep 7 2009 	Excellent friendly service	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Enterprise. This was my first stay at the hotel and made the booking at short notice. I had several meetings at Earls Court and Olympia and a friend recommended The Enterprise because of the location, quality facilities and friendly service. All of the staff made me feel very welcome and I took a couple of clients to the hotels restaurant in the evening which was fabulous. The Asian cuisine was exceptional and very impressive and the staff were very attentive. The rooms were delightful and fully equipped with everything I needed or would expect."
9,721,"Aug 24 2009 	size is everything after all	dreadful....uncomunicative staff, ridiculously small room, awful shower toilet box in corner of small room. slab like bed. i would be embarrassed if i charged so much for what is no more, once you get passed the plush downstairs, then a hostel. The cleaners do a good job but really this was beyond disappointing. I would have moved but we were only there for three nights and we stayed away all day every day. Not where you want to be."
10,721,"Aug 20 2009	LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!	Travel from Heathrow to hotel is very simple. Take the Piccadilly line to Cockfosters/Earl's Court Stop.(Now might be a good time to purchase an oyster card). Heavy Bags or tired take the lift to street exit, Hogarth street is across the entrance 2blocks you're there. Staff very courteous and informative, internet access also available (Google Maps etc.). Rooms very clean, European style design (storage available for luggage). Was excellent for Mother-Daughter trip.Centrally located in London, buses, taxis,and the underground make travel easy.( Did not eat at Hotel-Restaurant but was told by other quests that it was excellent.) Instead my daughter and I frequented the local restaurants, anything you want from fish and chips with a pint, to my Favorite Italian (TIZZI) 3 Blks Away. Vegan Options available almost everywhere! Enjoy!! I love London hope to be back soon."
11,721,"Aug 14 2009 	All fur coat and no knickers	My Husband and I decided to stay here after walking past it on a previous trip to London and thinking it looked nice, Big Mistake.From the outside it looks very modern and clean and very nicely decorated but this appears to just be the front of house and for the benefit of the Indian restaurant attached to the hotel. When we checked in the receptionist was surley to say the least. The room we were given was to the left of the hotel and had it's own wynding staircase. When we got to the room we were sorely dissapointed with what we saw. The bedroom was tiny with probably a foot of space around the bed. It was tatty and probably hadn't seen a paintbrush in a decade. The bathroom was small but clean.I was completely deflated and went to reception to complain. The receptionist explained that this was a standard double and what we had booked and I pointed out that it is not what is shown in the pictures on the website. She offered us another standard room which was better but still not what we thought we would be getting when we booked. When I asked if there was a safe in the room she looked at me as if I was mad.Overall this hotel was noisy, too hot and dissapointing. TBe warned do not make the mistake we did by judging the hotel by it's website. Will not be staying there again."
12,721,"Aug 8 2009 	The worst hotel experience on our vacation	We are not picky people and we rarely find ourselves unhappy with a travel experience, but picking this hotel was a mistake. The rooms were incredibly small, the bathroom was small and dirty, and the bed was by far the most uncomfortable bed that I have attempted to sleep in many years. We picked this hotel for its price and proximity to the subway which is its only redeeming quality. The great price was counteracted by the $85 they charged us for parking 2 nights. My advice for a traveler who is trying to get a room for under $200 per night would be to look farther out on the subway line (closer to Cockfoster). Hopefully the same money would get a slightly better room for a slightly longer commute."
13,721,"Jul 30 2009 	Very unpleasant	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff was extremely inhospitable and absolutely unfriendly. This is not the place to stay if you are coming to London. The rooms were extremely small and there was no air conditioning. The hotel also kept the heat on way too high so it was uncomfortable to sleep with only one fan, and they wouldn't give you a second fan if asked! Very unpleasant"
14,721,"Jul 20 2009 	Basic but not bad	Rooms very small, but to be expected, tiny tiny bathroom. Very quiet which was a plus. Only a 3 minute walk from the Metro station. A little run down but clean."
15,721,"Jul 19 2009 	Great location- good value- pleasant with no frills	We found a great deal on Expedia for this hotel for the week we were in London. Yes, European hotel rooms tend to be tiny, especially to us Americans who are used to everything BIG, and our room was small even by European standards. When leaving in the morning we could glance into a few rooms that the maids had open for cleaning, and discovered that not all were quite as small as ours. The hotel is nothing fancy. The room was a bit worn looking, but perfectly clean. The staff was pleasant enough. We did not eat in the restaurant. However, we honestly felt that given the prices in London, we made a really good choice. The location can't be beat. It is literally half a block from the tube station. The neighborhood is really pleasant with lots of picturesque Victorian row houses. No fears about walking around at night. It is also 2 or 3 blocks from a huge grocery store, where every day we bought some rolls, cheese, fruit, etc. for breakfast and lunch, and saved ourselves a fortune in restaurant meals. For dinner, there are lots of great ethnic eats in the vicinity, as well as a couple of decent pubs with tasty food.  It all depends on what you want. If you plan to spend a lot of time hanging out in your hotel room and demand a certain level of luxury from a hotel, this is not the place for you. If you want a clean, reasonably priced, pleasant place to sleep and store your stuff (with its own bathroom!) while you see the sights, you don't mind a small room, this is a great find."
16,721,"Jul 18 2009 	Laughably Small	We stayed for 9 days. The hotel pics are a fair representation of the lobby and rooms. The rooms are not nicely updated like the lobby and restaurant. The rooms are very, very small. However, they were clean and cleaned everyday. We were given fresh towels daily. The carpet and furniture were in decent shape. The beds a little springy, but not entirely uncomfortable. I guess we were lucky by London standards since we got a room overlooking the main street (meaning we had a balcony with large doors as opposed to windows making the orientation of our room slightly larger) but it was incredibly noisy. And we had to keep the windows open since there was no AC, so there was no getting around the noise.There is not much in the neighborhood as far as restaurants, its pretty residential. There's only a dinky pub, some Indian restaurants, but a small Asian run grocery store. A little further away (~5min walk) there is a larger grocery store, which is nice.The tube station is really close which is nice. The staff is rude and always seemed inconvenienced by us. There is no free internet. You have to pay for wifi. There is also a computer in the lobby if you need to use that, but they charge you to use the computer and charge you for internet.The biggest surprise was inside the hotel was really quiet. We got more noise from the street than we did from hallway noise.The only reason we stayed here was because we found a coupon from Expedia that took $30/night off our stay.Its a good base for London only because its close to a tube station and it was clean. The only real downside was how small the room was. It was soooo small!"
17,721,"Jul 12 2009 	Expected more for the money I paid	Although I expected a little more for the 3 star rating and the money I paid for this room which was really small and had a badly stained carpet, on the plus side, it was otherwise clean, adequately furnished and ideally located being so lose to Earls Court tube station. The ceiling fan was a welcome addition in the sweltering London heat. Didnt use the dining facilities at the hotel. Plenty of fast food places nearby if you want to eat cheaply and quickly"
18,721,"Feb 27 2009 	Excellent value for money	Two of us stayed here end February for one night. The hotel consists of a number of old houses joined together. It was very convenient for the Kensington Museums. It's located between Earl's Court and Kensington and we felt safe walking back there. Bus connections were good and as others have said the tube is only 2 minutes away.We were greeted politely by reception every time and our room was clean, a reasonable size and complete with TV and coffee/tea making equipment. We were at the back - no view but quiet. The only downside was the occasional whiff of a drain somewhere. We only paid GBP 69 (via Venere.com) for a double room which is very cheap for London. You do have to pay for almost anything extra though, e.g. even to use a credit card (GBP1.50). We had breakfast in Earls Court Road to save money. There are also two (Sainsburys) supermarkets nearby."
19,721,"Feb 26 2009	Great location	My sons and I spent 7 nights at the Enterprise Hotel during the week between Christmas and New Years. The hotel is easy to find, 2 minutes from the Earls Court tube station; also easy to take the tube to almost any London tourist location. I booked here because they have rooms with 3 beds, unusual near central London. The room and ensuite bathroom was small as is typically found near London, plain in decor with a small TV but clean at all times. The hotel appears to be several former row houses converted into a hotel. The public areas of the hotel appear to have been recently renovated. The hotel exterior, lobby, restaurant and bar were quite nice. The restaurant menu skewed towards Indian and the Middle East. The hotel desk is staffed 24 hours and the staff was helpful, giving directions and recommending restaurants and museums.Earls Court is a working class community but we felt safe at all times. There's a Starbucks 2 blocks away, which was a big plus to me."
20,721,"Feb 22 2009 	visit this hotel	using trip advisor i booked this hotel as the reviews were favourable.it looked good in the photographs and it seemed to be in an ideal location.i have been to london a few times and have had some horrific hotels so even though this hotel looked good and i had gotten 3 nights for less than 200 i still wasnt sure what i would end up with.i was not disappointed the foyer and restaurant area were very modern and my room (158) was a reasonable size very clean but no view,although this was not important.i can find no fault with this hotel the restaurant was excellent reasonably priced.this was a perfect location for getting around london earls court 2 minutes walk away and plenty of eating places and supermarkets surrounding the hotel.look into buying the 3 day pass on the undergound (16) i used the tube all the time and if i had just bought normal travel tickets i estimate i would have cost me at laest 5 times this amount.the staff were very friendly and helpful"
21,721,"Feb 17 2009 	Tiny old rooms	The double room is tiny. Bed is next to wall, so only accesible from one side. Furniture is old. You can hardly walk in the room. Bathroom is tiny (2 m2 at most), the sink is the size of a plane toilet sink. No one single shelf in bathroom to put your stuff. Completely dissapointing considering how much you pay, even taking an offer, the rate on the hotel web page is even higher and therefore not worth at all. For sure you can find better deals in London. Location is good, probably the only good thing of the hotel in addition to lobby."
22,721,"Jan 1 2009 	Quiet Street Convenient Good Value	We had a very enjoyable week in London from Christmas to New Years, and the Enterprise Hotel was a wonderful place to rest at the end of each day. After a day of walking, sightseeing, museums, etc., a quiet place to relax and reflect on the day was very nice. This hotel is very convenient for London travelers. Only 250 meters/yards from the Earl's Court tube station (District and Piccadilly lines - easy access to Heathrow), no long walk with luggage is required. There are many places to eat nearby (Lebanese, Chinese, Halal, Japanese, Italian, plus fast food options KFC, Burger King, McDonalds, Starbucks, a couple Cornish pasty shops) and a few neighborhood convenience stores including Sainsbury's (cheap groceries). Pubs, ATM's, internet cafes and laundry - these are all within a 5 minute walk of the hotel.The twin room we had was very small but clean. The water pressure was good, but the shower drain was slow. Free tea and instant coffee, electric teapot were provided. There are phones in the room which we used to call home (USA) and London - be aware of the charges, though they are not unreasonable. The staff was friendly and polite. The hotel is on a quiet little side street with a couple similar hotels - no road noise. If you are looking for a good place to rest after enjoying the day in London, the Enterprise is a good choice for the budget traveler."
23,721,"Dec 16 2008 	Consistently Good	This is my 3rd or 4th stay at the Enterprise. It's in a very good location just a half block from the Earls Court tube stop, and on the Piccadilly Line that comes in from Heathrow Airport and the District line that runs to central London. It's location is easy in and out of the city. The Earls Court area is a great place to stay, close enough to be just about anywhere in London in 15 minutes by underground, but far enough away from the City Center to keep the prices down. Don't book the Hotel Directly, even the front desk staff recommend booking through a travel site like Expedia. I was able to get a 5 day, average rate of under $100 per night! The Hotel is clean, fairly modern, well appointed. The rooms are the typical small London hotel rooms, but if all you are doing is sleeping there, who cares! It's also a good place to stay if you Pub Crawl as the entire front of the hotel is lit with a purple light at night, making is VERY easy to find.The staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a good area so walking around at night has never been a problem. There is internet access for a fee (15 for 12 hours of use) not a bad price for London, but it's very slow. Showers are small, and water pressure on upper floors is a bit weak, but again I've found that's typical for most 2 &amp; 3 star hotels in London.There is a restaurant in the hotel, it's OK for breakfast, but nothing special for dinner. The bar is good as well, if you don't want to go out, there's a big screen TV that always has a football or rugby match on. Within a short (1-2 minute walk) there are 4 great pubs, and a couple of pretty good restaurants so there's no need to stay in.I HIGHLY recommend the &quot;Blackbird Pub&quot; just a half block up Earls Court road from the tube stop. They have a great selection of meat pies. No Sweeney Todd here! The Venison (the specialty of the house) is fantastic! If you are in the mood for Italian Zizzi half a block down the street in the other direction is very nice as well, and if you get in late from Heathrow, they serve till midnight. If you are looking for a pub near the hotel, the &quot;Kings Head Pub&quot; is directly behind the hotel, and has a large selection of Beer and Ale.Overall, great value for the money. I will stay there again!"
24,721,"Nov 14 2008 	Clean friendly good location	Stayed there for 4 nights in Nov 2008. Hotel was a bit pricey compared to others nearby, but after reading the reviews about the others (dirty, insects, things not working etc) decided to give it a go.My room was very small, but I guess the norm for these type of buildings that have been converted into hotels. I knocked the TV with my shoulder, which then fell off its bracket, luckily I caught it before hitting the floor.Food in the &quot;Indian&quot; restaurant downstairs was excellent and very good value for money (try the taster plate for 9.95)Would happily return."
25,721,"Nov 13 2008 	Awesome location	If your looking for a good budget hotel in a awesome location, then this is your hotel.... If you are looking for luxury look elsewhere. This hotel is a minute walk to earls court tube station, which will bring you almost anywhere in central london. Also you can take the piccidilly line directly from heathrow airport to Earl;s cout. The rooms were small but adequate, and most importantly they were clean. The hotel does have a elevator, however it was small and since we were on the first floor hardly used it. I wouldn't recommend the breakfast, but there are many coffee shops with excellent pastries near by."
26,721,"Oct 21 2008 	Great!!	Married, 28 &amp; 31 years old. Looking for a hotel with a great, central location, CLEAN, and decent price. Enterprise was a jackpot! Located two minutes from the nearest subway which takes you pretty much anywhere you want to go in London (2 major lines Picadilly and District). The lobby was quite impressive, very stylish and great Indian restaurant in the lobby. Staff was The rooms were quite small compared to north american standards, BUT HUUUGE and very clean compared to rooms in Paris. Since we only stayed 3 nights, we did not mind. The bathroom was brand new, renovated, and very clean. Best sleep and shower I had in my 3 weeks through Europe! Would go back in a heartbeat."
27,721,"Jul 2 2008 	Very good!	It's got a good location, clean and tidy. Although the en suite was a bit small it was perfectly adequate. Staff very polite. No complaints at all."
28,721,"Jun 21 2008 	Central location	Stayed here for 4 nights based on tripadivsor reviews and was not disappointed.The hotel had a great central location with a 2 min walk to the tube station which was on the picadilly, district and circle lines.the lobby and exterior must have had a recent refurb as it definitely had a wow factor - the room was quite basic but clean and comfortable - exceptional value for London.breakfast in the hotel was also reasonably priced - we used this service on a couple of mornings.a bit of street noise at night but hard to avoid in a big city.highly recommend."
29,721,"May 31 2008 	Last Minute Deal GREAT LOCATION. NEXT TO TUBE	The reviews are so-so about this hotel, but my room was of normal size so I was quite happy. I had 5 bags of luggage and there was room...although I did have to step over them to go to the bathroom. The bathroom was the worst. There was no water pressure no warm water just HOT and COLD. We booked a double bed, but it was two twin beds pushed together so if you want to snuggle up to your sweetheart you might need to clarify a double before you get your key. The maids were awesome and very friendly. The front desk staff were so-so. One guy let us smoke out of the window in our room though, so that was nice. I can't really complain. I booked this last minute and hotels in London are so expensive...especially when you're converting from US$$. I didn't need a fancy hotel nor did I want a Budget with a shared bathroom. I found that this hotel was a good medium. My only complain was that the walls are super thin. One night a german couple were fighting for about 2 hrs. She was screaming and crying hysterically and running out of her hotel room and it scared me... it sounded like he was slapping her around or raping her or god knows what. I called the front desk and told them that there was a domestic disturbance and they called the room. They stopped for 5 minutes after the phone call, but continued after. I'm not exaggerating when I say this lasted for 2 hours. Not really the hotels fault for drunk or crazy guests. Other than that it was a really nice location to ALL of London. Earls Court Station is LESS than a 5 minute walk. It was a great location to get around all of London. There is also great great restuarants. We ate breakfast at Cafe Deli every morning&gt; They have amazing food and its cheap. Instead of getting breakfast at the hotel for 10- you can go to Cafe Deli and spend 6. There's also a lovely Indian Restuarant right by the ice cream cart.I would stay here again. I would recommend it. Just expect bad water pressure and don't let the fancy lobby fool you. The hotel rooms aren't new."
30,721,"Mar 16 2008 	Clean but small	I arrived at this hotel around 11:30 mid-day and I was supprised that they actually had my room ready. The lobby was pretty posh.After reading reviews on the hotel I was prepared for a small room, and that was indeed what was expecting my. But the room was very clean, and the bed very comfy. Even though I didn't sleep very well (which I'm sure is d-t first night alone in 2 weeks). But a must for this hotel is earplugs! The walls are very thin.The staff is also very helpful, my shower drain was blocked and was fixed the next time I had a shower. Very close (like 2-4min walk) to the sub-way at Earl's Court which can take you into the heart of London within 5-10 min. I will defently stay here again if I come back to London ;)"
31,721,"Feb 15 2008	Good value hotel	We stayed two nights at the Enterprise, and enjoyed our stay. The hotel lobby is really smart and stylish and the reception staff were helpful and friendly. Our rooms were functional - probably in need of a refurb, but clean and had everything we needed. We loved the location, really near to Earls Court tube station, and plenty of shops and bars nearby. We had a drink in the Kings Head pub round the corner and ate at the French restaurant opposite (3 courses for 10) - both venues were good. Travelling around the city from here was easy, by tube, on foot and by cab. A taxi from here to Harrods in Knightsbridge was 7. Would use this hotel again, no problems!"
32,721,Dec 24 2007	Avoid!	Would not recommend. Looks can be deceiving! I thought it was a nice place from what I could see in photos on the net. It looked nice from the lobby. Then we got to the guess floors. It is not as bad as the London Town or Premier Travel Lodge. I would avoid it you really have too. I would stay at a YHA/HI if I had to do it all over again. Thankgoodness Earl's Court provides many emenities. I love my Doner Kebabs and chips with curry sauce!
33,721,"Dec 1 2007 	Smart clean and convenient	My Mum and I stayed here three days, for a family party. The food was THE best Indian food that I have had for a long time.Our room (top floor) was quiet and we slept well every night. We had a narrow but decent bathroom with shower only. The daily maid service was excellent.I have read the other reviews of the Enterprise here, but our experience was really good. Price was average for Central London but the location (100 metres from Earls Court Station) is really convenient."
34,721,"Nov 20 2007 	Light Sleepers look elsewhere	Hotel is in a good location and convienent (3-5 minute walk) to the underground at Earls Court. Good location for a variety of dining choices, including Italian, Indian, Coffee, American fast food and pub settings. Additionally, very convienent to a grocery and pharmacy.Hotel staff was friendly enough, but not outgoing. Lobby is 1990s contemporary and includes a small bar and adjacent restaurant. Wireless internet access is available throughout the hotel in blocks of time for a charge, however in-room access was weak and troublesome; the best reception being in the lobby.Our room was a single double, clean and neat, and maid service adequate. Our view was of a brick wall, and the bed marginally comfortable. Aside from being very small, (I fully expected that) the walls are not adequately insulated and normal, &quot;inside&quot; voices from the ajacent room could be readily heard from inside our room. If you have neighbors who come and go at night, or stay up late or snore your going to hear that. Those who come a distance and suffer from jet lag or those who have trouble sleeping will not find a restful stay here. I would suggest paying the extra money for a more modern or national/international chain if sleep is critical to your enjoyment of your trip.Speaking of money, I shopped online for this hotel and certainly felt that I overpaid for what I expected. If you choose to stay here and are travelling with someone, consider one of the larger rooms. Pack your earplugs."
35,721,"Nov 8 2007 	Terrible hotel.....	My travel agent found this hotel for me. Her and I reviewed my options for price and this was one of the better looking ones from the pictures given at another hotel booking site. It looked too good to be true for the price. The pictures made the hotel look very modern and cozy. I arrived on Nov 1st 2007. As I made my way into the hotel I wasn't sure if I was in the right place. It looked nothing like the pictures online. I promptly walked to the desk to ask for my reservation. The receptionist, barely spoke English and it was hard communicating with her. I was tired from my flight and traveling on the tube, I waited for 40 minutes before she could find me in the system. I then checked in and proceeded upstairs to the 3rd floor. As I was walking other rooms that were being cleaned... my mouth dropped in awe. I was given a double occupancy room which consisted of two single beds. I was barely able to fit between the beds. The room was so small after I put down my laptop bag, my carry on and my medium sized duffel bag I literally had no more room to walk. Please keep in mind this is supposed to be a double occupancy room. After 20 minutes of unpacking I was finally settled in. I went for a shower and it took 5 minutes for the hot water to kick in. Later that day I also purchased a 4hr internet time card for my laptop. The system they use is terrible, it was barely able to load hotmail or outlook. Visiting websites was a nightmare, I used the internet to look up some hot spots for London and was unable to do so at times. Near the end of my trip I had a big issue with my internet time card, every time I logged on it told me the user name and password were being used. They had a look at it and told me to buy a new one when I had over 2 hours of usage left. After 20 minutes of arguing with the terrible receptionist she decided to give me a 1hour voucher that did not work which in turn dragged me out of the comfort of my tiny room to the lobby. I eventually bought a new time card and was able to use the internet without any hassle. The only good thing about this hotel is it's location. The receptionists had terrible attitude the whole time I was there.The one positive point with this hotel is the location. Other than that there is nothing. They will not be seeing me again."
36,721,"Nov 2 2007	Disappointed with the Enterprise	The hotel was very clean and it is in a great location. However, we booked a double room and what we actually got was two single beds, with single sheets, on wheels that were pushed together and moved apart every time one of us got on the bed! It is also good that we are not big people as there was only about a foot of space arond the beds and the shower room door hit the bed everytime it was opened- in fact we could lay in bed and open the shower room door! I have known better hotels for the price."
37,721,"Oct 6 2007 	Perfect Location and Hotel	I was a little nervous after reading some reviews about this hotel but I'm glad I stayed there anyway! My girlfriend and I are in our late 20's and we wanted a hotel that was clean, affordable, and close to everything in London. This hotel was just that! The location is right off the Earl's Court stop which makes sightseeing on your own VERY EASY! Then getting to bars, club, restaurants and shopping is also just a couple tube stops away. The staff was friendly enough for what we needed. We used the safe in the hotel and there is a computer with internet connection that we were able to print our boarding passes the next day in the lobby and the restaurant looks GREAT even though we didn't get a chance to try it. One last point is that this hotel is extremely easy to get to from Heathrow - just get on the Piccadily line and you are there! I will certainly return to this hotel, for this location the price is unbeatable!"
38,721,"Sep 11 2007 	Great location	I have stayed in quite a few hotels in London some Great some not so great! The Enterprise was ok and would probley stay again as the location was excellent.The hotel itself? Ok , the rooms are very small but very very clean housekeeping clean the rooms every day , There is no A/C so it was very warm and we kept the window open all the time, The bathroom is tiny and the shower worked but getting the right temp was a nightmare but was quite funny to hear my husband getting a cold shower!Keep your valuables with you or put in the hotel safe.Staff were not overley friendley but polite.Location, Brilliant! Just a minute away from earls court underground and we walked to the natural history museum the science museum and the VA museum, Earls court has a great atmosphere and we walked around at night visiting a few pubs feeling quite safe .So if you can put up with a small room which after all your only going to sleep in ! Its ok!"
39,721,"Sep 10 2007 	Very good.	As has been said on a previous review the rating of this place is a little lower than I suspect it should be. Although there was a little confusion over my booking it was quickly sorted out and with no fuss. Room was of a good standard, with en-suite bathroom, tea facilities, balcony, tv and all that you would expect. Though not the biggest of rooms I've ever stayed in it was very comfortable and clean. I would have no reservations in stopping here again and I reckon I probably will make it my regular London haunt."
40,721,Aug 3 2007 	Great for the price	My wife and I stayed here in the summer. The room we had was small but fine. We didn't go to London to sit in the room. Its location is great just steps from the Earls Court Tube stop which gives you easy access to London by Tube.The staff is very nice and helpful. The only issue we had was the noise. It was warm and without A/C we had the window open. The room was not hot but the noise was very loud. Lots of loud people late at night outside. Also in adjacent rooms you can hear thru the walls easily. It didn't bother me so much but my wife could not sleep. I don't know if they have rooms that do not open to the street or not but if you are anything but a heavy sleeper I would be concerned about the noise in the summer with the window open.All together we enjoyed it and for the price is a great stay just be aware of the fact the it is a small room and can be loud. But the location just a few tube stops away from central London is great.
41,721,"Mar 20 2007 	Better Than The Ratings Imply	We stayed in the Enterprise for 5 nights. I thought it was fine. Here are the good and the bad. The hotel is very close to Earl's Court tube station which has 3 lines going through it. There are lots of interesting small restaurants, pubs, handy shops, and internet cafes nearby on Earl's Court road. It's a working class neighborhood. There's a nice vibe to it. The hotel is secure and safe. I never felt uncomfortable in the neighborhood or in the hotel even late at night. Our rooms were very small, but they were clean, neat and functional. Our rooms had balconies (not all do). I liked having the balcony. The TV in the room worked properly, and the radiator worked very well. The bathroom was also small, but functional. My toiletries bag hangs, which was handy because there is littl to no shelf space in the bathroom. If you are a really large person the shower could be a bit claustrophobic. The staff was always courteous and very helpful. There is free wifi in the lobby and lounge, but it has encryption and I could never get my laptop to connect. (This is my only complaint -- other hotels have free wifi with no encryption and it is EASY to use.) There is a computer in the lobby connected to the internet, but it costs 1 pound for 15 minutes. The food in the restaurant was good, and the the wait staff was very accomodating of my kids' food requests. We would return again to this hotel. We would recommend this hotel to friends unless they specifically expect large rooms and an American style hotel."
42,721,"Feb 1 2007 	Small but functional	After reading some of the reviews I felt i had to write my own!I was really worried after reading some of the things people have said however i was pleased to see that they were not true! The Enterprise is worth the money. you get what you pay for here!The lobby of the hotel was really modern and it was clear that renovations had taken place recently. The staff on the desk were really helpful and unlike in other hotels we didnt have to wait to check in.The only available rooms when i booked were twin rooms so i took what was available. however when we arrived our room wasnt available. After realising we were a couple the manager offered us a double room at no extra cost which we gladly accepted. In no other hotel have i had this experience - a free upgrade and check in before 12!!!!Our room was quite small but was clean and perfectly functional. There was however little or no floor space and as a result i had to open my case on the bed everytime i needed to remove something (an annoying experience when you're a girl!!)I loved the fact that the key had to be used to switch the electricity on! Really quirky and eco friendly! Exactly what the world needs in 2007!On our second or third night we had a problem with out sink draining which we reported to reception as we went out for the night. The next day we left to go out and when we returned the sink had been repaired as promised! no reminder necessary.The area around Earls Court is said to be a little seedy in another review however we never encountered any evidence of this(except call girl ads in the payphones on the street!!). Like in any city, if you keep yourself to yourself late at night you'll be fine!I would recommend this hotel and will definitely return! Functional is exactly what you need in a city like London with sooooo much to see!Must Do:London eyeLondon AquariumWest End Show (Lion KIng is AMAZIN!)Places to eat nearby:Eat (brilliant italian -have the bannoffi!!)Garfunkels (like TGI's...really good food!)"
43,721,"Dec 13 2006 	Ok budget hotel young couple.	I stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend in a standard double room. As a Norwegian citizen (pardon my English), it was my first time in London, but I soon realized that London hotel rooms are not among the largest. The Bathroom was extremely tiny, and barely fitted one person. The room was a bit bigger, but it did still not have a lot of free space.Even though the rooms are tiny and the hallways are narrow, it was a clean and healthy hotel. The hotel met my expectations as a normal budget hotel, were the important factor is location.The only negative thing I might have to point out, except the small rooms of course, is the lack of isolation and the poor oven. These factors made the room a bit to cold, and I could easily hear what kind of language that was spoken in the hallway.If you are looking for an ok hotel room, as a base camp to explore London and excpects no further luxury, this hotel is absoluteley recommendable."
44,721,"Oct 6 2006 	What was I thinking?	I don't know why I did not read the reviews here before booking the room. Staff at the hotel helpful enough, but indifferent..I was able to leave my luggage, but wasn't able to check in until 5pm! That is just ridiculous..when I get off an intl flight I can't wait to get to my room and take a shower. Bathroom decent size by UK standards.My room was right next to the elevator--UNFORTUNATE--because every time the elevator door opened the door to my room would creak into place--I was so afraid someone was breaking in! Not the most secure doors in the world; the door didn't close completely unless you locked it with the chain. Loud bar downstairs on a Saturday night; not good if you want to get to bed early. The bed was very very uncomfortable, completely sunken in on the bottom right side. And the whole business of having to put your key into the WALL to get electricity is just BIZARRE!!!So, no I will not be staying here again."
45,721,"Aug 23 2006 	You could do better than this	The positive thing about this hotel is that it is easily accessible from the tube (and what's more there's direct connection to Heathrow from the particular tube station). But this is where the good things stop.The rooms are small, the mattresses old, the staff couldn't care less, and the whole establishement looks run down and dirty.Truth is that there IS a reconstruction thing going on, but I'm not sure it's gonna get any better by the time it's done with. Oh and although my room was on the first floor I didn't get any incovinience from the works done.Another thing: when I arrived (since I was earlier than check in time) I left my luggage at the reception, no problem there. When checking out I took my stuff to the reception and rushed to a meeting, only to find out later that THIS time I had to pay for my left luggage."
46,721,"Jun 13 2006	Give this one a miss	Found this hotel through a popular web site. Easy enough to find when getting off the tube at Earl's Court. Short walk with heavy bags. Hotel was being &quot;renovated&quot;. I was not made aware of this prior to my stay. Rooms are absolutely tiny and no one tells you that your key is also the only way to get electricity to work in your room. Bed was like sleeping on a concrete block with a cotton sheet. I could not open my suitcase and have my partner walk around the bed to go to the miniscule bathroom at the same time. Room was on the third floor. No screens on windows so flying bugs get in. Noise from the street was extreme at night but as there is no air conditioning you must sleep with the window open. I had a terrible problem getting the waitress to charge breakfast to my room, not sure if it was the language barrier (most of the staff sounded Russian or Slavik) or some other hotel policy that was not explained to me and was completely unable to get a receipt for my stay when I checked out."
47,721,"May 28 2006	Worst Experience!	this is probably the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. It began at checkin when they seemed suspicious of our reservation... they then put us in a room on the 1st floor closest to the construction (we hadn't known about). Each morning we woke to loud banging of hammers and power tools, we also had the power go out 5 times. When I went to complain they didn't even know the power was out, nor did they believe me. Finally we moved to the 4th floor which got us away from the construction but led to other problems like the door not closing completely and NO water pressure. To top it all off, everyone was rude to us. After coming from Paris and having unbelievably friendly people taking care of us, we were shocked to find this treatment in London. We will never go back there."
48,721,"May 2 2006	Great Location Good Value Small Space Bad Food	The location of this hotel couldn't be better. Just a block from the local high street with the tube stop and many conveniences such as post office, chemist, bank, launderette, internet points, and many cafes and restaurants. The street itself was very quiet with little traffic. My main reason for choosing this hotel was that it had a lift, but the lift was extremely slow and a bit dodgy. However, it could handle three people with their luggage all at once. Very few hotels in this price range advertised lifts at all, and it was a must as I was traveling with my elderly mother.I never expect a large room in a big city hotel, but this was one of the smallest I've been in. The twin beds were pushed right next to each other and there was still just barely enough room for our suitcases. The bathroom was clearly built into the room and things stuck out at odd angles, though everything in the bathroom worked. We also appreciated the electric kettle. Another oddity: the room key (we were only allowed one) had to be inserted into a device in the wall in order to turn on the electricity in the room. This was unpleasant when one of us wanted to take a nap, as the other could not go out with the key -- we had to knock on the door and wake the sleeper to return.The restaurant in this hotel was wretched. One night we were too tired to go out to eat, so we stayed in. Even our very minimal expectations were blown away when we were served soup that was clearly made from a powder. We had chosen fish and chips, expecting frozen food, which we got, but the international staff obviously misunderstood what sort of vinegar goes with the meal -- they brought out the cruets of olive oil and red wine vinegar that would normally be served with a salad, instead of the expected malt vinegar for the meal. Don't eat here unless you are desperate."
49,721,"Apr 20 2006 	Never been back.	Not recommended from our experience. Tiny, dirty, noisy room. Very poor decor, who knows what splashed up the wall, dirty valance on bed. I couldn't wait to leave and have never been back. I hope it has been refurbished."
50,721,"Mar 13 2006	kareoke central!!!!!	upon arriving at the hotel i knew that this hotel was something special! the hotel is currently unergoing a re-fit so the reception has been moved into the resturant, apart from that little confusion i can happily say that the enterprise hotel was excellent value for money and in a brillant location! we had booked 2 rooms and where given rooms next to one another, which had an interconecting door which we were given the key for. the rooms where spacious and the bathrooms in particular were very new, clean and had room to swing a cat. having paid such a low price for this hotel we were a bit dubious before ariving but once we where there we fell in love with it. the staff were excellent, very helpful and friendly. on a friday and saturday night the hotel has kareoke downstairs, which was probebly one of our best nights ever! it is free to guests and i had the most fun that i have had in a long time! if you have/are thinking of booking this hotel - please do it!! it is in an excellent location and is one of the nicest, quirkyest places i have ever stayed!!!"
51,721,"Mar 9 2006	Cheap and Okay	This is the kind of hotel where you have to ask for what you want. I booked a standard twin room, and the receptionist tried to put me in a room with a double bed and a sofa. Then when I asked for a standard twin (2 twin beds), she gave me a key to an older room, which had ratty bedspreads, the smallest bathroom ever, and absolutely no room to move. Not exaggerating. So I went downstairs again and asked for one of the newer rooms, as seen on the internet. Then I got a standard twin room with plenty of room, newer bedspreads, and a balcony. For a cheap hotel, I was happy with room, but I could see how if you don't press for what you expect from online photos, you could end up in a slum of a room. I really couldn't have stayed six days in a room that small, and I've stayed in hostels back in my college days. Overall it was a good value, but some of the staff won't give you the best they have to offer unless you request it.The surrounding restaurants were great, and the tube connection was awesome. Stay in Earls Court for sure!"
52,721,"Feb 22 2006	Thank You Enterprise Hotel 	What fun we had at the Enterprise Hotel, attractive bar and restaurant in the hotel, and the surrounding areas of Earl's Court! A pleasant walk to the underground, not to mention some great restaurants in Earl's Court area. Our two grandkids, two sons, two daughters-in-law, and the two of us had no complaints. So what if the rooms were far less than American size for heaven sakes...We spent only our sleeping hours there, and were delighted with London, Portsmouth, Cornwall, the Tate Modern, the Savoy for high tea, the pubs, and that great little Indian restaurant just up the street from the hotel &amp; just before the main street and Underground. We'll be back and next time we'll stay longer! Thanks to all!"
53,721,"Nov 18 2005	Cheap clean and convenient	Excellent location and clean hotel. It's just a few steps away from Earl's Court tube station, which is on the main lines from the Heathrow Airport and to downtown London. The hotel is in a great area - there are restaurants, a grocery store, internet cafes, a bakery, a post office, all within a short walk from the hotel.What I liked:- Clean room + bathroom- Lots of channels on tv- Great location !!- Cheap (about 45 pounds for a double-occupancy room)- Plenty of hot water- Quaint, homey atmosphere with lots of Van Gogh paintings on the walls- Desk, night tables and armoire in room to store some of your belongingsWhat I didn't like:- Beds are a little uncomfortable and small- Tiny room with hardly any floor space- Paper-thin walls (you can easily hear your neighbors if they are louder than average)- The shower's water pressure is extremely weak, and sometimes non-existant for a couple minutesIf you are looking for a cheap but decent hotel, this is the place to book. It is great for travellers who are tight on budget but who'd prefer not to stay in hostels. I was extremely satisfied that I got my money's worth! I would strongly recommend it if you are OK with the slight inconveniences listed above."
54,721,"Nov 12 2005 	A balanced and truthful review	To sum up this place:Pros:Amazing location (seconds away from Earls Court tube)Friendly staffClean rooms with regular changing of towels, bedding etcMultiple channel TV in room along with celing fan, radiator etc so you can regulate temperatureCons:Small rooms, even for London, but you get all you need in them!Slow lift!Slightly uncomfortable beds in truth but you get used to itIn conclusion, for the price I got (around 35 a night) this hotel was great in terms of location and cleanliness. I did get a double room to myself and I expect if I had shared with someone else I would have really struggled with space. If you want to live in your room, find somewhere else for the extra space. If you want a cheap base from which to get around London you wont find better for the price!"
55,721,"Jul 29 2005	Nice Hotel	Wow... I was surprised to see all the bad reviews about this hotel. I was there last year and I must say I rather liked it there. Maybe I was lucky and got one of the better rooms, I don't know... It was rather small but it was clean, the bed was nice and both shower and tv worked perfectly. I think the staff was nice; we had a lot of fun one day in the bar of the hotel. When you're in London sight-seeing and just need a nice, though not luxurious, place to spend the night, I'd recommend it."
56,721,"Jul 6 2005	Nice place	Convenient location. has restaurant, close to tube(subway), quiet street, clean room, daily maid service, inexpensive"
57,721,"May 20 2005	All-nighter in railway station preferable	Fifth-rate dump with service to match. Tiny room was the ultimate in stuffiness. Window was completely sealed shut even though on third floor. No ventilation. Exhaust fan in bathroom grossly inadequate and rattled very loudly when on. No space for luggage except on floor between bed and wall, trip-over hazard in the dark. Bathroom dingy. On arrival clerk claimed we had no reservation. When shown confirmation printout from hotels, she claimed their computer was down and gave us the room with utmost reluctance. Only London hotel I have ever stayed in where breakfast was not included. Nice lobby is deceptive. The only explanation of the three-star rating seems to be the elevator. The place is for first-time suckers only. Repeat business is inconceivable."
58,721,"Mar 14 2005	Terrible.	This review is about The Enterprise Hotel in Hogarth Road, London, UKWe expected a nice quiet room with all the necessary facilities for the high price we paid (109 per night). The room was very basic, no double glazing (noisy being on the street side), no air conditioning, and did not have a good night sleep due to people talking loudly at 2 p.m. We had to complain twice to the reception but still the residents kept talking until about 3 p.m. We left the hotel first thing in the morning. Never to stay there again or recommend to friends.Althought the hotel was awarded a 2* rating, it is not worth a 1* rating. A hotel located opposite this Enterprise hotel, charges 45 per night for a family room of 3 persons including full breakfast. In the future, we will only stay at well known hotels like the Hilton, the Holiday Inn, or Novotel (all 4* hotels). These luxury hotels charge less than this terrible bed and breakfast room accommodation.This Enterprise hotel was booked for us by an agency: hotelsolutionsdirect, after our booking via the internet of another hotel was subsequently cancelled by this agency even though the reservation was previously confirmed.Avoid using agencies. Go direct to hotels for booking and only consider the well known hotels, if you are after a comfort and peace."
59,721,"Mar 5 2005	Did We Stay In The Same Place?	This may not be the Ritz but we had nowhere near the negative feelings voiced by most here. It's in the Earl's Court area, about a two minute walk from the tube. Not the best area but we never felt unsafe either. Nice old style hotel on a quiet street. Rooms are small, they all are in London! Clean, staff was fine though no one is English. Breakfast was decent and most important early, around 7-7:30am. We would stay there again. Overall though, seeing the other comments, we were either lucky or our standards are low."
60,721,"Jan 16 2005	Good location very tiny no water pressure	Location is excellent, close to tube station, fast food, hospital and the only 24-hour pharmacy in London. However, rooms are the tiniest we've ever seen. We had a quad--4 twin beds so close you couldn't walk between them. Bathroom was also tiny and the water pressure for hot water was a trickle. We've been told that small hotel rooms are typical in London--especially in the less expensive ones, but this was extreme."
61,721,"Sep 29 2004 	Seedy Smelly Scary!	The room is between two floors. There is mildew and mould all over the shower. There is no room for a suitcase... it takes up the entire floor. The ceiling is so low that if I hop out of bed I will hit my head (I am only 6ft). The curtains have cigarette burns on them. The window is filthy.Basically, everything is dirty, smelly, and probably a health risk.No way this sucker deserves 3 stars unless I was mistakely assigned the broom closet.Avoid at all costs."
62,721,"Aug 23 2004	Very good	Small room, but perfect location, near shops, good (simple) food, quiet neighbourhood, good connection with city center and Heathrow. Clean. Good shower, tv. Friendly people"
63,721,"Aug 6 2004	Can you say a slum	It was small, smelly, not too clean. Smoking or not, the rooms SMELL!! We could not sleep half the time because of the smell. The floors look like they have never been swept (even if they have). The hotel is also very, very noisy...you can hear every thing. I would definetly not recomment it...no way thats 3 stars"
64,721,"Jun 21 2004	Tiny room	Extremely small room. Rooms are 50/night not including breakfast for a single. You can get a lot better for this money. Location is ok, close to main roads &amp; tube station.Bathroom is in need of refurbishment. You can get better for your money."
65,721,"Feb 6 2004	Avoid Avoid Avoid the Enterprise	This was the most disgusting hotel we ever stayed at. The advertisement of the hotel on hotels.com said it was air conditioned -- it was not, &quot;newly renovated&quot; - probably in 1960. The rooms were tiny, the beds were lumpy and there was a musty odor. It also said they had electronic door locks -- which must mean you need to use your key to turn on the electricity. Whatever you do not stay here!!!"

1,723,Standard of room OK given the price but bathroom very poor.	Only a one night stay - bedroom was OK with comfy bed &amp; Breakfast was OK . BUT let down by very poor bathroom - (GF room to rear)Shower - Chrome peeling off shower head &amp; bar. Unable to adjust temperature satisfactorily - borderline between being frozen or scalded. The shower curtain was covered in black mould. No hot water in the evening when we arrived. The drain in the floor centre wasn't tiled right up to leaving a gap which could cause an injury to feet . Paint peeling off coving on the ceiling . Also the basin was very small - the sort that you would normally only find in a WC.
2,723,"Nov 20 2009 	Excellent hotel in the budget range	We stayed in a ground floor room which was clean and comfortable and although on the small side provided adequate storage, TV and hot-drink facilities. I'm not a fan of wet room bathrooms and the shower was a bit fiddly but nevertheless the bathroom was well-presented and clean. The full English breakfast was a bonus at this price level and the breakfast room and kitchen area were squeaky clean. The locartion is very close to the Paddington tube and mainline stations. No need for a taxi unless you have lots of luggage."
3,723,"Oct 6 2009 	Great Location Price and Breakfast	We stayed for 5 nights with our 3 kids aged 14,13 &amp; 10 and found it to be a fantastic location close to Paddington station for easy access to central London.The breakfast served was also a great way to start each day and the staff were really lovely."
4,723,"Sep 2 2009 	first rate value for money b	Room and ensuite spotless, just ensure when booking that any elderly or infirm travellers check they're not on the top floors as there's no lift. Full English breakfast included in price which was excellent."
5,723,"Aug 19 2009 	It was the only mistake we made for our trip	As I said it was the only mistake we made for our Europe trip. We will definitely not going to stay there again. When we got there, we would told that they double booked our room and needed to send us to his Uncle's place next door (later we found out, they have no relationship at all). The room we had was so small that there is no place to put our two small luggages. Two beds were sinked in the middle. Worst of all, they did not tell us that towels are only changed every THREE days. On the second day, they picked up our towels from the bethroom floor and expected us to re-use them. In the middle of the last night when we all slept, the owner called and ask us for the payment. After all, there is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in our life and really don't want to try again."
6,723,"Jul 16 2009 	Tidy Place to Stay	Stayed for one night in June, from Paddington Station its an easy 5min walk and therefore easy acess to all major attractions, the lady in reception was pleasant and our room was tidy and suited us well. The breakfast service was slow but for the price we could not complain, I would stay at this place again"
7,723,"Jul 5 2009 	Good location but very rude staff!!	The location was wonderful for central London but I have never been treated as badly as I was by the breakfast staff during my stay!! There were two woman working in the breakfast area when we went down for breakfast and even with only two tables occupied when we got there we were ignored for more than 15 minutes. Then instead of coming to take our order, one of the women came over and rudely told my friend to move to the other seat as they could get busy and walked away. When it became apparent we were not going to get any service my friend flagged the other woman down and asked to order. The woman proceeded to reprimand us for not waiting as they were cooking our food?? We finally got her to stop and understand we hadn't ordered but she continued her verbal abuse when we asked to have an egg with our continental breakfast and treated us like we were errant children. By the time our food came neither my friend or I had an appetite! I made a complaint to the front desk staff that morning and was reassured it would be looked into but nothing happened. Also when we checked out the lady at the front desk was quite rude as well! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!"
8,723,"Mar 6 2009 	Excellent accomodation for a low cost	I chose Europa House Hotel online when in New Zealand for it's close proximity to Paddington Station and low cost. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights. This hotel exceeded my expectations. We were in room 9 which was large with a double and single bed. Very comfortable and warm with views to the street below. The bathroom was very compact (to be expected), but renovated to a high standard so was much appreciated considering the low cost of the rooms here. I would highly recommend Europa House Hotel to the budget conscious traveler as London is not a cheap place to stay, particularly so close to the city. The owners and staff were very friendly and accommodating and I would definitely stay here again."
9,723,"Jan 21 2009 	Cheap and Cheerful	I stayed at Europa House for 6 nights in January and was extremely impressed with the location, it's a lovely quiet street.Getting my suitcase up to the top floor was not fun but the room was fine with a tiny but recently renovated bathroom and a small LCD TV with digital channels.Breakfasts were good, with a choice of continental or english, though they could heat up their baked beans a bit more.I would highly recommend this hotel as it's so close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations and Hyde Park. I also managed to find a cheap laundromat nearby which is always handy."
10,723,"Jan 17 2009 	Location location location	Looking for convenient location, reasonable price and hearty breakfast, this is your destination. We have stayed here multiple times over 13 years and have always found Fran to be most helpful. Rooms are small and bathrooms are small but you can't beat it for the price, breakfast and location. The neighborhood is quite charming and the pubs are filled with locals as well as tourists. Rooms are being refurbished and updated and the tranformation is positive."
11,723,"Jan 11 2009 	Cute place to stay	A few friends and I stayed at this hotel for 12 days recently. Because of the length of our stay they gave us an EXCELLENT discount. The breakfast was delicious and FAR better than the typical free breakfast you recieve at most hotels. Most of the staff seemed to have trouble understanding us, despite the fact that we speak english. However, the owners were very wonderful people that understood and helped us completely. The location is great. It is right by Paddignton station which connects pretty much anywhere you could want to go. There are plenty of places to eat right by there also. I would recommend the location to everyone!The rooms are very tiny so, if you're looking for a really nice hotel to spend lots of time inside, then this is not the right place. However, if you're anything like my friends and I, and want a comfortable place to sleep while you enjoy your time in London, I highly recommend this hotel!My only complaint is that our room was on the 3rd floor, so each day we had to hike up 60 steps to our room. This wasn't really an issue except when we were transporting our luggage up and down!...but hey, it was good exercise!Overall, if you're on a budget definitely stay here! It is probably the best value for your money!"
12,723,"Jan 9 2009 	Disappointed	I stayed for 8 days .. Chose it due to its proximity to the Tube. The room is very small but I guess this is common in Central London hotels. However, the fan was not working which was only tolerable because it was Nov. The reception guy did offer a table fan but the room would be more cramped hence I refused it.The walls of the room are very thin and i could hear the movements in the next room. I dared not open my window as anyone could look into the room from the nearby building. The service levels were bad. the waitresses in the breakfast room never smiled and was at times impolite. (no buffet so the guests had to depend on them).On the last day I had to satisfy myself with only a cup pf tea because the waitresses were too slow in serving (I was served last though I arrived first) . I did not want to miss the flight. The saving grace were the reception guys who were very friendly and helpful. I do not recommend this place for a long stay. OK for a night ."
13,723,"Jan 6 2009 	Would not recommend	We agree with Mobsta from Bournemouth!!And from Mobsta's photos it looks like we stayed in the same room (first one at the top of the stairs!!) We were en route from Australia to Athens and spent 3 night stop over in London. Room so small you couldn't swing a cat and had to step over our suitcases to get around bed as hanging space was non-existent, radiator never heated up so freezing cold, 1 flat pillow each and no extras. As you will see by Mobsta's photos, the shower/toilet cubicle was terrible and you couldn't call it an ensuite like their web site does. We also took the same photos to show our friends.......... Rooms like this shouldn't be rented out until they're refurbished!!!Staffing: Every time we went to reception to leave/collect our room key or ask a touristy question, staff was on a &quot;personal&quot; call on his mobile phone and never ever interrupted his calls to deal with hotel guests - customer service???Breakfast: The menu says eggs (plural) and bacon but you only received 1 and were ignored when you requested 2.We definitely would not stay here again nor recommend it. Fortunately all other accommodation during our 6 week holiday in Europe and the UK lived up to their web site spiels and photos ."
14,723,"Oct 26 2008 	Not good Strange substances!!	We have just returned form a 1 night stay the the Europa House Hotel. We stayed in Room # 4 which was quite a small room, with a double bed in it, which is normal for London, but the toilet/shower room was abysmal and there was a strange substance in the hand basin that was not identifiable but did resemble some kind of excrement. Also in the bedroom area there was some splatter marks on the lower wall which looked very similar to dried blood, which wasnt very nice at all. The room was 'simpy' decorated with a duvet blanket and one very flat pillow per side of the bed. The room was also very cold, although there was a radiator in the room it seems as if they are not using it as yet so the room was very cold. The best thing about the room was the flat screen Tv which had FREEVIEW satellite channels and a clear picture.Our room rate of 85per night including breakfast from Laterooms.com was quite high for the quality of the room and as the room was so horrible we didnt have much faith in the breakfast so we didnt bother going down for that.All in all, I wouldnt stay here again, not even for 50 per night! Pictures attached!!"
15,723,"Sep 26 2008 	A very friendly owner	I stayed at this hotel on my visit from Washington DC. We were family of four. This was a clean hotel with a very welcoming staff.Neighborhood is good and safe, close to metro. There is a bus stop also close by. Either bus or train be got in 10/15 minutes walk. For us with a faily of four cab was a good option as the cab cost around 10uk to central London. Overall from my side *****Rajesh"
16,723,"Sep 10 2008 	Good Value Accomodation	It was my first time in London and having read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor about London hotels I wasn't expecting much. But to be honest this place had the best reviews I could find for the amount of money I wanted to spend. And lets face it if you're there to sight see then all you need is a bed, shower and somewhere to keep your bags!So for me this was a budget accomodation that fulfilled that need. Better value than a backpacker's place!I had a single room on the first floor and the room was an ok size, just enough room to swing a cat ... but only just! 8-)(Check out my photos).Room was clean and tidy. Shower was awesome! Plenty of hot water (which is a pleasant surprise compared to some of the places we stayed in Europe).TV had many channels to watch so that was good to be able to relax and watch after a hard day wondering around.However the highlight of the stay was the full English breakfasts every morning! Awesome and a great way to start the day!Staff were friendly and helpful (although there were some minor communication difficulties with some staff members).My only complaint is the wall thickness. It was quite noisy between rooms and I could hear the people in the room next to me clearly. Also unlucky me in room next to a snorer! Street noise could be bad for some who are light sleepers, but for me I got used to it.Great location - close to Kensington gardens makes it easy to get into the city centre (just hop on the underground tube).So overall a great value budget accomodation place to stay if you just need a bed for the night and a starting base for your sight seeing."
17,723,"Jul 26 2008 	GENUINELY NICE PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON	What a genuinely nice place to stay. We arrived at Heathrow airport and took the Heathrow Express Train to Paddington Station. We then walked (with our rolling luggage) the short distance (a few blocks) to the hotel. We stayed at the Europa House for 5 days, and would book there again when visiting London. I would have written a review sooner, but after departing the hotel, we enjoyed a cruise to Norway and then spent a week in Paris. When we arrived at the Europa House, we were assigned to a 4th floor room which was a challenge since we are not young anymore and there was no elevator (lift). The Europa House was fully booked and the owner unselfishly and diligently tried to get us into another close B&amp;B with a room not so high up. There were no other rooms available nearby, so it was necessary to accept the 4th floor room. The owner carried our luggage up the stairs for us. How very hospitable. Then, the next day, a very nice room came available in the basement floor (near the breakfast area), and the owner again moved our luggage for us. Both rooms were very clean and comfortable, complete with a bath. The breakfast was very good and complete. We noted that all of the other customers were also enjoying the very ample breakfast. The staff was always very polite and also suggested interesting places to visit nearby. I am still so very appreciative that the owner was so sensitive to making our 5-day visit so very accommodating. Like I said, we would stay there again because of the genuinely appreciated hospitality. The hotel is close to everything that we needed access to such as Hyde Park, subway stations, train stations, and tour buses."
18,723,"May 25 2008 	DISHONEST OWNER	Stayed at Europa Ouse Hotel for 3 nights in the beginning of May. I was overall satisfied with the room and the service. But upon arriving home I realized that I had paid TWICE for the hotel bill. On the day I checked in they swiped my credit card, and I assumed that it was for 'guarrantee' and that they will swipe and charge the credit card again on the day I checked out. But on my last day there I decided to 'get rid 'of some remaining cash, so paid half of the bill by cash and the rest with credit card. When I realized what had happened, I sent them an email immediatelty demanding for my money to be returned. It's been 2 weeks now since I initiated contact with them and after several emails, I still haven't heard from them. They chose to ignore my request and keep the money. I'm angry with their dishonesty and appalled that they choose to sacrifice their good name and reputation for a mere GBP124 (that's what they owe me). So for potential customers in Europa House Hotel, be wary of the THIEF who is your host."
19,723,"Apr 23 2008 	Really nice stay very helpful staff	Me and my mum stayed here at the end of March for her mothers day pressie. We stepped off the train at paddington and the hotel was only a 3 minute walk away, first impressions of the reception was that it was a little run down but as we were early they let us keep our bags in the storage cupboard and we went off shopping. Came back to properly check in and our room was in the basement we opened the door and to our suprise the room was lovely very clean, the bathroom was small but adequate for what we wanted. the staff are very helpful and the breakfast which was included was a full english and very tasty, even on check out as our train wasnt until the evening they let us keep our bags in the storage cupboard so we could go off shopping. Very pleasant stay and would stay here again as extremely good location for the train/tubes."
20,723,"Mar 23 2008 	Satisfied with Europa House	My wife and I and our two teenaged daughters stayed at Europa House for 5 nights in mid-March in one of their quad rooms. Unlike in North America, European hotels don't tend to consider that families of four people often like to share the same room when they travel as booking two separate rooms becomes very expensive. As such I was pleased to find that EH Hotel had rooms for up to 5 people at very reasonable rates considering their central location just a block from Paddington station. Some of the previous Trip Advisor reviews of this place had given us pause, however. Fortunately the room (after some initial booking issues over the internet) turned out to be clean (enough) and very adequate. The bathroom wasn't a highlight as it was very tiny and the toilet seemed to consider the flush lever as more of a suggestion than an order. Still the shower had great pressure and hot water and the bathroom seemed clean. The breakfast was included and did fill you up but wasn't changed at all from day to day so by Day 5 we were tired of it. The front desk staff was helpful and even kept our luggage in a locked room for us on checkout day so we could sightsee for the day without it when we only left town in the evening. I definitely recommend this hotel for budget-minded travellers/families who want a basic clean room in central London."
21,723,"Oct 29 2007 	Friendly helpful and inviting	The hotel is in my opinion very good value for money being only minutes from Paddington station. The staff are friendly and helpful doing all they could to make my stay comfortable. I was upgraded to a double room and although some rooms are not huge the ones I stayed in (2 different ones) and those who were travelling with me were clean comfortable and well maintained. The ensuites were well maintained and the dining facility for breakfast was great. The breakfast was not anything fancy but was tasty and filling with many options. I will be returning to this hotel next time I am in the UK as it is cost effective and safe, not to mention close to Oxford St!"
22,723,"Sep 25 2007 	Pleasant surprise	After reading previous reviews I arrived at our hotel with a certain amount of trepidation, but the price had been great and the location central, so I was willing to take the chance. Our room (all doubles have twin beds) had the scent of fresh laundry and was spotless. The decor on first appearance, seemed to be shabby, but as we became accustomed to our surroundings, appreciated that the paintwork was fresh and the beds clean. Hey, this is London - everything is old. The ensuite bathroom worked well (the best shower in 2 weeks of travelling the uk) but the bathroom of the 2nd room we'd booked only allowed you to sit on the toilet 'side saddle' because of the cramped conditions. Breakfast was included in the price and was a very pleasant surprise. The breakfast room in the basement was freshly renovated and showed a new clean stainless steel kitchen which gave it a bright and cheery feeling. The full breakfast was cooked to order and was served pleasantly and swiftly. The reception staff were very helpful with negotiating mini cab fares to the airport and once you took time to speak to them on a personal level, would go out of their way to help. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking for a great location and good budget accommodation."
23,723,"Feb 5 2007	Friendly staff	I stayed at the Europa House hotel 10 nights since 10 till 20 of January 2007. I am pleased. The location of the hotel is great: 3 minutes from the Paddington station and not far from Oxford street. My room was comfortable, cosy and clean. The breakfast was good. The stuff is polite, they speak a few languages. Sonia and Ilona speak also Russian, they are very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to travelers who is looking for a reasonable, but acceptable variant.Lidia from Moscow"
24,723,"Jan 8 2006	Comfortable stay at Europa House	We spent four nights at Europa House and can say that our stay was quite comfortable but I am unsure if we would stay there again. We would like to try one of the other numerous B&amp;B's along Sussex Gardens. The staff at Europa House was very friendly and always helpful letting us know that running the water for 10 minutes would produce hot water, fixing our tv so we got 5 channels rather than the half a channel that was coming in, and always during breakfast. The food was tasty although tiring after three days but the staff is willing to change up the traditional English Breakfast to cereal, scrambled, or continental breakfast. Do not plan on long showers while staying at the Europa House since you will be contending with a very small shower. Overall, a pleasurable visit that met our basic needs for our short stay."
25,723,"Nov 7 2005	Quite nice	i can say that my stay at the europa house hotel was quite enjoyable, apart from its fantastic situation, the staff are always willing to help and polite at all times. the rooms are highly decorated, and the size is normal for a hotel in the centre of london. breakfast is quite rushed but the staff are always willing to give second servings and offer a reasonable selection of english breakfast, coffe,cereals, juice and toast. i was very impressed by the fact that the owners speak both english and spanish perfectly and understand other languages. Overall, i will definately return to the europa in the future, as it offers quite good value for money."
26,723,"Oct 28 2005 	great never been better	i travel a lot bcause of my job and the europa house hotel was probably one of the best i have ever satayed at.i recomend it to everyone who wants cheap and great.the receptionists speak pakistani,english,spanish,french,portugese and italian the owners are spanish they are a great family they will tell u all the great places the best reataurants and also will call a guide for you.the rooms are on suite, clean, wadrobes and with tv very confortomble bed. BEST EVER"
27,723,"May 15 2005	Terrible...absolutely terrible!	Apart from the filthy, exposed, dirty mattress (from the local dumpster perhaps??), the strange smells, uncooked bacon at breakfast, warm friendly service (not!) it may have been ok. Take this as a warning...DO NOT STAY AT EUROPA HOUSE!"
28,723,"Jan 12 2005	Okay but you might do better...	We stayed at the Europa House Hotel in Sussex Gardens (wonderful location about a block from Paddington train/underground station and Heathrow Express) for 5 nights in November 2004 and paid 60 pounds ($111) a night for a double room--good mattress, reading lights over the bed, in-room coffee/tea--with a small bathroom. The shower was tiny, about 24 inches wide, and the unavoidable wet shower curtain that billowed in on the bather made it very much like showering inside a wet T-shirt. The bathroom vent did not work. That aside, the room was clean and quiet, although the decor was decidedly tired and dreary. It could be chilly at times because the central heat was turned on at 5:30 p.m. and turned off in the morning. Our room was on the ground floor, in the back, as I had requested when I reserved online. Management was responsive to questions and requests and let us check in as soon as we arrived, about 10:30 a.m., which was much appreciated after a long flight. TV reception was awful--no satellite or visible antenna--so no CNN and only three viewable channels of mainly trash TV (little news). The breakfast was basic but adequate: fried eggs, frozen juice, frozen hash browns, canned baked beans, tea/coffee, and toast. Boring long before the fifth morning, but enough food to keep us going for hours. Main complaint: breakfast was rushed, only served from 8-9 a.m., unlike other B&amp;B's I've stayed in that generally have a wider window of serving times or slightly longer hours on Sundays. There were many similar hotels lining the street, and I think I might have done better pricewise if I had shopped around. Europa House was full on just one of the weekend nights; otherwise, there were always vacancies there and in the other hotels along Sussex Gardens, at least in the off-season. While the hotel is nothing special, it's reliable, functional, and convenient. I'd stay there again."

1,732,"Oct 16 2009 	was ok	not too bad given the location. rooms were really old, felt like someone had maybe died in there.got some sleep though and its on a quiet area and easy to find. not overly clean.female receptionist was very rude."
2,732,"Oct 5 2009 	Basic clean and cheerful in good location.	We got a twin room at 40 per night for the room, an excellent price and a five minute walk from Paddington Station and the Bayswater Underground. There is a bar next door but there are others in the local area that are just as nice. God amount of take aways and coffee shops. There is also an internet cafe round the corner and many of the cafes have WIFI while the hotel does not. Kensington Gardens is within walking distance which was nice in the evening and the street itself isn't too busy, considering it's quite central. The room was clean, though the decor is old fashioned, gloomy with torn wall paper. As stated elsewhere the shower was freezing, which wasn't great and there was no light in the toilet at one point, to be fair this was quickly fixed. Generally tere wasn't much spae ut we were expecting that. The walls are quite thin and we could easily hear next door but as we had quiet neighbours this wasn't an issue. No reception on TV which looked about 25 years old. I wouldn't want to stay for any longer than a couple of nights but I have no real complaints about the actual hotel because we got a clean room in a good location at a fantastic price.The only thing I would complain about is the maner of the young reception at the desk incredibly rude. It was the same girl we spoke to on arrival and departure and she acted with utter disdain, rolled her eyes, was very abrupt and looked as if her face would crack if attempted to smile. We didn't ask any questions or make any complaints just checked in and out. I know this was cheap accomodation but her colleague was treating other customers with good maners and she could have done the same thing. I rarely make personal comments about people in the service industry because I work in it myself and know how horriblet it can be but she had no reason to be so unpleasant with us and to be honest was the rudest person we met on the entire trip"
3,732,"Jul 24 2009 	Basic but OK	Small room with bed, TV, sink, wardrobe and bedside cabinet. Kettle and coffee / tea. Surprisingly quiet at the back. Bar available in hotel next door. Breakfast available - but cheaper options in cafes roundabout - I can vouch for Luigi's in Spring Street. Staff friendly and helpful. Reasonable price 35 for a single. Handy for publ;ic transport (tube, bus and mainline rail services) and also an easy walk to central London."
4,732,"May 5 2009 	Value for money	Great location - a short walk from the city. Great value for money - I paid 55 pounds for one night. Rooms are fine - nothing flash. Recommend it if you are looking a well located, value for money spot."
5,732,"Oct 16 2008 	Feels Like London	Just what one would expect for a cheap hotel in the middle of London. Oddly, though I had the chance to see two rooms. When I first arrived my room was #3 a tiny room with two twin beds, a shower and sink in the room and a toilet outside of the room but inside an unlockable door marked &quot;private&quot;. This was fine with me, although I booked a single room with facilities in the room. Off I went to enjoy a walk around Hyde Park only 5 minutes away. When I returned, they had moved my luggage to room #5 for a reason they did not explain. This room had a double bed and a twin bed with shower, bath and toilet all in a room within the hotel room. Both rooms were cozy, clean, old, and typical. The staff was as good as they needed to be. Would recommend to a friend and indeed did to my friend visiting from Holland who enjoyed her stay as well."
6,732,"Apr 22 2008 	cold shower but okay otherwise	Clean room, good bed, windows open onto quiet street, not too noisy at night considering location. One shower between 7 rooms is really not adequate and it was cold in the morning. Breakfast okay if you like deep fried eggs, lukewarm beans and burnt then scraped toast. Nice staff. Toilets not so nice."
7,732,"Oct 12 2007 	Clean but beware the bedbugs	The room was a decent size and generally clean, though had that slightly grotty old feel many budget hotels in London have. Windows opened, which was a plus seeing as I stayed there for the two days of summer we had in 2007. Good location. Perfectly adequate, or so I thought.I saw a couple of bedbugs on the last night and complained to the receptionist the next day. She was very rude and couldn't care less. That day I started to develop bite marks all over me - a week later they hadn't gone and I had over 200 lumps all over and was in agony. Three months later, I still have a few scars and scabs from them.Overall, reasonable budget hotel in decent location and near to tube stations, etc, but cleanliness of the beds left a lot to be desired. Book with caution."
8,732,"Jan 6 2006	Whose Jenny and Steve	I don't know who Jenny and Steve are, and quite frankly I don't care.What I wanted was a cheap hotel with easy walking access to the centre of London for New Years Eve, and that's what I got.It was nothing special, but was a safe secure place for me to leave my stuff and sleep at night.Only real complaint is that of the 2 single rooms we booked mine smelt baddly of cigarette smoke."
9,732,"Dec 21 2005 	Good location nice enough...but cold shower!	I stayed here this weekend and found it to be quite good. The location is excellent and I didn't find it particularly noisy. There are lots of good places to eat and drink round the corner, and transport links are excellent.We had to check in at the reception desk next door and the staff were friendly enough. It was perhaps a little impersonal, but they were certainly approachable and polite.Our twin room was nice and clean with a balcony, an old tv set, and a sink. Our toilet and shower were out on the landing. My only complaint was the lack of hot water in the shower, which was disappointing when we were pleased with everything else about this hotel. I had to have a cold shower first thing in the morning which was pretty bad.Otherwise, I would stay here again purely based on the price and location alone. We were free to come and go as we pleased with very little contact with the owners."
10,732,"Aug 26 2004	A cosy home-away-from-home	Our family have stayed in this Hotel with Jenny andSteve a few times over the last ten years and found it quiet, friendly and good value for money.If the hotel has been sold to the people next doorI sincerely hope they keep the same standard of service as the previous owners. If not-this is another family who will be looking for a London base."
11,732,Feb 14 2004	Goodbye Jenny and Steve	We began the first of many pleasant stays with Jenny and Steve at Fairways in 1987. Discovered it quite by accident and were attracted by the clean smell of furniture polish wafting out the front door. It was our London home-away-from-home. Very sorry to read in the previous review that Jenny and Steve have now retired. Good things always have to end.
12,732,"Jan 2 2004	No more Jenny and Steve :-(	I stayed here about a year ago with my daughter and we both loved it. Our room was small but cute and clean. The owners, Jenny and Steve, went out of their way to make us feel welcome and served a delicious breakfast. However, when I recently went to book this hotel again I found that it had been sold to the hotel next door. I guess the owners retired so I would never book it now. I just want to warn people to be careful."
13,732,Oct 10 2003	Mixed Review	Friendly staff but very noisy
1,733,Oct 11 2009 	Be Warned...do NOT stay in a basement room!	I had seen reviews and thought this looked worth a try??I also noted the comments about the basement rooms so asked for a room upstairs. When I arrived there was some confusion over my request for a room NOT in the basement. The receptionist took a bit of time to look at the keys then decided she was not able to help.I ended up in a double room with a shared shower/toilet although I did have a sink. The kettle did not reach the plug so I had to put it on the floor but the dried milk seemed to curdle when water was added
2,733,Sep 24 2009 	Excellent - exactly what I wanted	I was looking for something clean 
3,733,Sep 24 2009 	Great Place if You Have an Upper Room	This place
4,733,Sep 20 2009 	Excellent Value.	The Fairway reception is across the road at the Central Hotel
5,733,Aug 23 2009 	Good location and service room needed work	This is a good value for travelers on a budget
6,733,Aug 11 2009	Good location tiny room!	I stayed here in Mid- June with my parents
7,733,Aug 7 2009 	staff/location good. hotel facilities poor	on arrival at hotel found it to be a bed and breakfast. room was extremely small
8,733,Jul 25 2009 	Great experience and I will be staying there again.	My teenage son and I stayed in a twin ensuite room on the second floor. The room was very clean
9,733,Jul 9 2009 	Small but clean and cosy	We had to book this hotel at very short notice afetr we discovered that we needed to stay in central London for the night. We steered clear of a few hotels in the area which did not fair too favourably on this site.The location for the hotel was very handy for what we needed
10,733,May 2 2009 	Very basic accommodation. Clean good breakfast great location	The service was OK. When we got to our room we saw it was a twin even though we had booked a double. The guy at reception appeared to care
11,733,Apr 7 2009	Very Good Hotel In The Best Location	There was some confusion when we first arrived at the hotel as there are two seperate hotels under the same company (Fairway and Central). Many of the group didnt recieve the rooms we booked however
12,733,Dec 2 2008 	Great Location and Nice Hotel !	I stayed with my family at the Fairway Hotel last month.The location is excellent. Just a few steps from the King Cross station
13,733,Nov 12 2008 	Excellent Location Comfortable stay Good prices	We were actually put up in Central Hotel which is right across the street. We had a triple room which was nice
14,733,Nov 9 2008 	Good quality and value	Stayed here for a couple of nights. The Fairway and Central are owned by the same family and the reception for both hotels is in the Central.I booked a double ensuite for 2 nights in the Fairway and that's exactly what I got. A good-sized
15,733,Oct 31 2008 	Fairway or central	Well I booked a room at the fairway and ended up in the central. I understand they are pretty much one and the same. Very last minute booking I was meant to be staying in a hostel but after reading terrible reviews I chickened out. Paid £48 for a double room (no singles available). When I got there I got offered an upgrade to an en suite for £9. I said no thanks and when I got my room which was in the central it had an en suite anyway so I'm glad I said no. Nice clean room. TV and tea and coffee facilities. i didn't have the breakfast 5.15am eurostar so booked for the location was included in the price though. Nice friendly staff they were fine with me checking out early. The best thing was the location though literally across the road from st Pancras 2 mins walk. Was very happy with this budget room and won't be staying in the travellodge again.	
16,733,Oct 15 2008 	bad services	We did reserve on the good advertisement and a reasonable priceWe did not get the reserved rooma small room on the top floornot a good bed
17,733,Jul 10 2008 	Perfect Location and Friendly Staff	Just returned from a 2 week stay in London. The room was small
18,733,Jun 24 2008	Okay for a short stay	The only reason why I booked this hotel is I want something near to King Cross/St Pancras International station since I am leaving for Paris and the other hotels are fully booked. Indeed it is very close to the station
19,733,Jun 3 2008	Just what I was looking for central and clean	I stayed at the Fairway hotel but it seems that the Central across the road is the same 
20,733,Apr 22 2008 	Avoid...	We booked a room at the Central Hotel and when we arrived were told that we'd be checked into the Fairway. As soon as you go in
21,733,Feb 21 2008 	Good Location	The hotel is located just few steps from tube station and bus stop.Small room and toilet/shower
22,733,Jan 10 2008 	Great Location	Four of us stayed at this hotel in a quad room
23,733,Nov 5 2007	The Pits	This hotel is about as low as one could go. The double room was single size. The toilet
24,733,Jul 9 2007 	Great Location!	I stayed at this hotel in March 2007 for 1 night. I was allocated room 12 which was an ensuite room. It was very reasonable at just £48.00 per night. THE ROOM:The room was well sized considering location. All the furniture in the room was matching pine. There was a double bed (even though Id booked a single)
25,733,Jul 4 2007 	Different experience	It is very difficult to find low budget lodging in downtown London
26,733,Jun 15 2007 	Be Prepared	Location is very central. There aren't nearby bars/restaurants I'd go to but if you're planning to visit all of the touristy spots
27,733,May 28 2007 	Stay Elsewhere!	I'm surprised by the generally positive reviews that led me to booking this hotel for our stay in London.As a budget priced hotel
28,733,May 22 2007 	funky but affordable	Funky but affordable place to stay in London. With the US vs. UK exchange rate
29,733,May 2 2007 	Great price and location but avoid the basement rooms!	My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for a bank holiday weekend last September. Some friends of ours have stayed there before and highly recommended it for the price and location so we felt safe in booking a room there. The location right across from King's Cross station really can't be beat
30,733,Feb 12 2007	Great value Great Location	Yes the room is small
31,733,Feb 12 2007 	A cosy gem near Kings Cross Station	My son (23) and I (52) were in London for a music gig &amp; wanted a modest but clean and quietish hotel for one night. The Fairway was perfect - the room was well furnished
32,733,Nov 22 2006	Can be recommended	One of the best things about this hotel is that it is a few meters from Kings' Cross
33,733,Nov 10 2006 	a budget gem	My friend and I were spending just one night (at short notice) in London so we needed somewhere central and cheap - got a double ensuite for £65 off LateRooms after seeing favourable reviews here. At such a low price we were a bit worried it would be a total dump but this couldn't be further from the truth. The room was modern and clean and tastefully decorated in neutral colours (no chintz and clashing carpet) and though small
34,733,Oct 30 2006 	near to Kings cross station	Just arrived back from a two night stay at the Fairway Hotel.Near to Kings Cross station
35,733,Aug 18 2006 	SMALL clean adequate...not bad I guess. An honest review...	I stayed in the Fairway for a couple of nights. Here are my thoughts:SMALL SMALL SMALL. I actually couldn't believe how TINY my single room was! When I first arrived at the hotel
36,733,Aug 5 2006 	We will Return to the Fairway	The best thing about this hotel is itsSTAFF...they are lovely people and its location to the train and tubes at King's Cross. We were warned that the area was a bit rough but found it filled with families and business folks during the day.My husband and I plus 3 friends stayed in 3 different rooms at the Fairway and each had different &quot;takes&quot; on the hotel. My husband and I were very happy with our accommodations
37,733,Aug 1 2006	Clean friendly and perfect location	Perfect location
38,733,Jul 26 2006 	Not for TALL people!!!	My boyfriend and I are very tall
39,733,Jun 22 2006	great value for money	exellent value for money
40,733,Jun 9 2006	simple and clean hotel	I stay 3 nights there. The room is small but clean. The location is excellent and safe. Breakfast is sample and no many options. Overall the hotel fits for short stays.	
41,733,May 24 2006	Great value!	I stayed there for five days and i found that it was a perfect location
42,733,Apr 29 2006	Best Value in London	Yes
43,733,Apr 12 2006	Really Clean Perfect Location And Friendly Staff What Else Can You Ask For?	I stayed with my family in this bed and breakfast when they came to visit me in London as im an international student
44,733,"Apr 3 2006	Not so ""lovely"" after all.	Less than impressed when we got there. Although the staff was so very friendly"
45,733,Mar 19 2006	Not the best	I suppose the hotel was ok for the price we paid
46,733,Jan 25 2006	Great Location	I was not expecting much from when we first arrived to the hotel but was pleasantly surpised when I saw our room. It was small but very clean. The location was right around the corner
47,733,Jan 22 2006	Excellent value convenient location	The Fairway Hotel is an absolute gem in its price category. Our room was small
48,733,Nov 22 2005	Very very good choice	We stayed at Fairway Hotel for 5 nights.The room was really small but everything was very clean. The breakfast was nice and the staff friendly.The location is excellent to discover London because King's Cross station is the crossing all of the tube lines. Great value for money(68 GBP for a triple ensuite room).I will stay here again...	
49,733,Oct 23 2005	Great Location is the best it has to offer	Absolutely great location to use to visit London. The rooms were extremely small and the bed were very uncomfortable. The showers had little temperature control and no shampoo was provided. Breakfast was quite nice. The staff was friendly and very helpful. All would have been great had the rooms been bigger.	
50,733,Oct 6 2005	Parva sed apta mihi	C'mon guys
51,733,Aug 12 2005	Lousy	The room was extremely small and the double bed looked more like a glorified single bed. I should have measured just how small it was because I would wake up every so few hours to make sure I hadnt fallen off of it yet. The toilet seat is plastic and ours was broken
52,733,Aug 1 2005	Good value for a family	Stayed at the Fairway hotel in a family room with my husband and two daughters 12 and 16.The room was a little cramped with a tiny shower but it was spotlessly clean and serviced each day. The breakfast was either full English or continental and we were always offered more toast and drinks. The staff at both breakfast and the front desk were friendly.Not luxury but comfortable and a good base to explore London.	
53,733,Jun 21 2005	Very good value for money	Stayed here June 2005
54,733,Apr 25 2005	Okay	We stayed with my son at Fairway in April. The room and the bathroom was very small indeed. But everything was clean. The bathroom was ok. The location is 1 minute walk to King's Cross Underground station with many lines passing thru. Location is great.The Breakfast is simple but good value for that price. The price was 65 Euro per night per double.It is ok if you spend very little time in the hotel room.
