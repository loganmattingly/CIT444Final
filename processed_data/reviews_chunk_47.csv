85,1085,"Jul 20 2009 	Fantastic Location	We stayed here to go to Take That Concert Breakfast was fantastic Room was really lovely but I did book a Double and we Ended up with a twin the hotel was fully booked so we had to stick with it, but saying that we have had an offer from them that we can not refuse I will certainly be going back ;-)"
86,1085,Jul 19 2009 	A beautiful hotel in the heart of London with a friendly team	This beautiful hotel is set in the centre of London and a stones throw away from the Shaftesbury Theatre and Oxford street. The hotel team were extremely friendly and helpful through out our stay.The food in the hotel restaurant was stunning.
87,1085,Jul 16 2009 	Rooms Very Small	Stayed here for two nights with my daughter - location is very good especially for theatre. The hotel is very nicely designed - modern decor but we felt the rooms were very small - we both ended up with bruises on our legs from hitting on the bed - really cramped. On the second night we asked for a bigger room and paid and extra 34 - we were moved to a room with a double bed and a blow up bed. OVerall I think the hotel was okay but I wouldn't stay here again.
88,1085,"Jul 16 2009 	This beautiful hotel is a stones throw from londons famous oxford street.	Having arrived at this hotel we were greeted very warmly with a special welcome from Kumar the hotels public relations manager, who could not have done enough for us. As is was our first wedding aniversary Kumar had arranged for chocolates and strawberrys for our room which was very beautifully decorated and modern with all the mod cons you would expect from a radisson hotel ie. plazma tv mini bar and in room internet access. The food in this hotel is amazing and well priced, if your not sure what to have try a combination of the cooked meat and seafood platter that arrives in a lovely wooden box. Breakfast was also amazing. This hotel is located five minutes from the main shopping district of London which is the famous oxford street and the hotel is also very near the london underground subway, which will get you anywhere in london high speed rapid. The only downfall with this hotel is that the bar closes way to early, try throwing an irish man out of a pub at one o clock in the morning it doesnt go down well. Well done to all the staff here that made our visit so magical."
89,1085,"Jul 15 2009 	I could not have picked a better hotel	The reception / lounge area was refreshingly cool during a hot spell outside. Staff are well mannered and pleasant and attentive. The room that I was in was very comfortable and there is a hearty breakfast in the morning. I didn't eat in the restaurant simply because there is excellent choice within minutes to the hotel. Also Covent garden is less then 10 minutes walk.The only downside was the morning paper that I ordered didn't arrive, but I made do with a complimentary daily."
90,1085,"Jul 14 2009 	Very Nice Hotel good location	Upon arrival we were greeted by very efficient and professional staff. The hotel looks new and the decor is tasteful and modern.The room we were assigned was on the second floor and was a decent size. The bed was comfortable, and even though the room had three windows, it was very well insulated from the street noise. The location of the hotel is convenient to the center of London. We had breakfast included in our rate, and it was GREAT. Very good service and excellent food selection. Overall we were very satisfied with our stay"
91,1085,Jul 14 2009 	Good Days	Had a lovely time and would most definatly do it again soon.
92,1085,"Jul 12 2009 	This place makes Fawlty Towers look 5 stars - beware!!!	I don't know where to start with this review as it is sooooo bad. Firstly I arrived on a Friday evening and there was a Salsa party full of underage drinkers happening in the lobby (very loudly) - there was no use complaining as some of the attendees were staff as they came and went from the room behind the reception desk.After struggling from the taxi with several bags - there is no porter service, so you need to manage your own luggage - 3 people stood behind reception whilst I struggled to manouvre through the revolving door with all my bags.The fitout is very nice, and recently refurbished in an elegant manner - so after seeing the public rooms I was looking forward to seeing my room. I was shown to a twin room on the 3rd floor - (room 3004) - it seriously was about 2 metres square - with the 2 beds and a wardrobe there was no room for our bags and 2 adults to be in the room at the same time. But very nicely fitted out. I called reception to ensure that this was a superior room as I had paid extra for a superior over the standard and was told it was and when I enquired if all the rooms were this size was assured they were.The next day the shower blocked and flooded the room. Maintenance were quick to respond and said it happened regularly and they would immediately fix and dry the carpet in my room. I left for the day at 10am. When I returned at 7pm - the carpet was still sodden and all they had done to dry the carpet was open the window. I complained and asked to be moved to another room as I was staying for a week. They argued for a while about not having other rooms and so I said I would check out then as I was not prepared to stay in a wet room - and miracously they found another room for me.My new room was on the 7th floor and was about 4 times the size of my previous room - so much for all rooms being the same size. The next day I told them my airconditioning wasn't working - the thermostat said 19 degrees so it would cut out after 1 or 2 minutes, when in fact it was about 28 degrees. After 3 maintenance guy visits they all said it was fine and they hadn't done anything. Finally the concierge Kumar came to help - and he was the ONLY person in the hotel who had any sense of service ethic. He got it fixed and did everything he could to try and improve my stay. If it wasn't for him I would have checked out at this stage.The list of complaints goes on so I will summarise:-tried to order room service from the menu in my room but was told they don't actually have the food on the menu (pizza etc) - just sandwiches. When I said 'whats the point of the menu then?', they didn't care.-asked for a taxi to be ordered to take me to a business meeting - took 40 minutes for them to understand the address, I even had to log onto google maps and print it for them and take it down to reception. (and this is supposedly an english speaking country!)-booked a meeting room in the function centre for 6 hours supposedly with tea, coffee and water - they didn't offer tea or coffee once during the 6 hours or even refill the water, there were no staff visible at all -after having a very nice muesli for breakfast on the first morning, I enquired for it on the next morning and they said they had run out - never appeared again for the rest of the week. Likewise the coffee making machine broke on the Monday and wasn't fixed again for the remainder of the week I was there.All in all a nice looking hotel - but the service levels are what you expect of a 3 star hotel - they have no idea of what 5 star service is, and given it was in excess of 250 pounds most nights certainly not what you pay for. I usually stay in the Charlotte Street hotel, and tried here for a change but it was a big mistake.Beware - if you are used to good service you will not like anything about his hotel - it is amatuer hour on every level."
93,1085,"Jul 10 2009 	Great value in great location	i have stayed there twice this year and will stay again next time i am in london for leisure. the location is great, only a short walk from tottenham court road/ oxford street and covent garden/ leicester square - all of the rest can be easily reached by bus and tube.hotel and rooms are newly refurbished in a modern and trendy style. the first time i got upgraded without noticing it and got a spacious, quiet room. the second time the room was significantly smaller, but still not too bad for london standards and certainly large enough for a city hotel stay. the great thing about radisson is they offer free wifi service - a thing that most other hotel chains lag behind and makes their rates great value in comparison to other hotels where you have to pay extra for it.another plus: staff are very friendly and go out of their way to assist customers."
94,1085,"Jul 7 2009 	A warm welcome and a very comfortable stay!	Having stayed in Radisson hotels in the USA, I was interested to see how a London hotel would compare. My wife and I were not disappointed! Our room was immaculately clean, comfortable and well provided with refreshments and entertainment facilities (including some late-night &quot;street theatre&quot; courtesy of the Met Police and an agressive scooter rider!). The air conditioning guaranteed a comfortable sleep on a very humid night. The hotel restaurant menu looked very impressive, if not a little pricey, but there are a number of good restaurants and bars within a few minutes' walk of the front door. For those reliant on public transport, the hotel is a very short walk from two London Underground stations and the area is well served by cabs and buses.A short walk also takes you right into the heart of Covent Garden and the British Museum is also very close by."
95,1085,"Jul 5 2009 	An efficient and relaxing experience'	I travel to London on business at least once a month and often more and discovered this Radisson when it was th venue for a meeting I attended. Sine then, it has been substantially refurbished and it shws!I now stay there every time I come to London and I combine business and pleasure by staying tehre either before or after a business appointment. I have stayed in a veriety of rooms all of which have all been excelently appointed, some with great views of London with the starting point being the British Museum across the road. Significantly, weather permitting, it is a pleasant walk to Euston from the hotel and only round the corner from Oxford Street with easy access to shops and theatres.If I had a gripe it would be that room service could be better in terms of the food being kept hot but the staff do their best to help in this regard and are fast and efficient at delivering fod and drinks.I am always made welcome and staff on reception treat me s a regular customer and actualy appea to remember me rom last time! This is a luxury hotel wher I feel 'special' with staff ready to respond to any request fro service. I am always disappointed if I am unable to get a room there so I book early to avoid disappointment!"
96,1085,Jun 30 2009 	Modern hotel in good location	Helpful and attentive staff; good location and impressive decor. Our room was a good size (king deluxe) and the bathroom was very modern &amp; had a great rainfall shower. It's central to oxford st &amp; the british museum. Just round the corner there's a great french restaurant &quot;Savoir Faire&quot; and the food is fantastic. It's a little quirky decor wise but great food and very competitively priced. Could not recommend it high enough.
97,1085,"Jun 29 2009 	Top Class	Must be one of the best hotels in London for quality, service and value. Gotta agree with others who have raved about the place. Very nicely modernised, with every touch included. Asked for a quiet room and it was. Nice size, very comfortable, well away from the main roads, with great double glazing and soft carpets that dampened any noise from the hallway. I liked the simple touches that make a hotel that much better: not just free wireless, but a couple of machines availble for the general user. Ice/water dispensers at each floor. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, quality cream yoghurts at breakfast, etc. Can't praise the staff enough. They would do anything to make your stay a pleasant experience; from Mercedes at the check-in on arrival through to Gary the concierge helping with issues even after I left. Many thanks to you all."
98,1085,"Jun 29 2009 	Oh yes this is more like it!!!	This hotel seems opulent and boutique-y when you enter, and you may think it's a bit too clinical looking because of the black marble foyer - but trust me, this place ROCKS! I was booked into this hotel as my original choice was unavailable and I am SOOO glad! The staff were brilliant - welcoming and professionally friendly. My room was compact without being poky, beautifully decorated, fresh and comfortable with an excellent bathroom. I had my breakfast delivered up to my room for a very reasonable charge - and when I left the next morning the helpful staff and the charming concierge gave me a map to find where my meeting was taking place, and directions for the quickest, safest route. Such warmth and helpfulness was a surprise, and I am very glad I was booked in there instead of my original choice! I want to go back!!!"
99,1085,"Jun 27 2009 	Beautifully and completely remodeled modern ideally located.	This is a very, very nice property that appears to be completely refurbished (not simply remodeled!) Our room was really perfect for our needs. The bathrooms, with their rain-style shower heads and marble or granite construction was definately a highlight. The British Museum is less than a block away. There is a small convenience store across the street. There is a bus stop 1/2 block away and the Tottenham Court Road subway station is about 2 blocks away. There are theaters within walking distance, a major YMCA health club, many restaurants, shopping, and other retail stores. The St. Pancras international rail station is nearby. If you are in London for business or pleasure, you really can't go wrong by staying here."
100,1085,"Jun 27 2009 	cramped	room was very small, can get better hotels for the same price ..very avg"
101,1085,"Jun 27 2009 	One of the best london hotels I have stayed in.	Our fantastic experience at the Radisson began as soon as we arrived .After a very early flight from Belfast we were allowed our room from arrival at 1100 am. The staff were friendly , hotel was immaculate , room was very well appointed with superior views and an excellent bathroom.Right in the centre of all the theatres , an underground station a short walk away our only regret is not staying longer.Highly recommended we would certainly stay here again when visiting London."
102,1085,"Jun 26 2009 	Excellent service at the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury	My stay at the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street hotel in London has been very plaisant due to the extraordinary friendliness, service and attention of the entire staff. The restaurant is excellent. The hotel is also situated in probably the most pleasant area of London, close to the British Museum, Russell Square, Bloomsbury square, and in walking distance of Covent Garden. This is a real winner for a plaisant and rewarding stay in London."
103,1085,Jun 26 2009 	Nice and modern hotel	Centrally located and modern. Good service. Food average.
104,1085,"Jun 22 2009 	Luxury and service reliable and friendly	HiI like to try and stay here when i am in london. I am a lady and i travel on my own - this place is safe, friendly and cool.Rooms lovely and nice smellies - the bathrooms do not disappoint. Clean bedding and great room service.I arrived on a late sunday evening and needed to print some bits for an event the next day. The two chaps on reception were brilliant - they sorted it all out for me and I emailed them the docs and even thought the format was wrong - they sorted it all out for me and did me lots of copies.Breakfast coffee is great also and I got porridge on request.I will be staying again soon.L"
105,1085,Jun 19 2009 	Felt like a Boutique Hotel......no sterile chains here!!!!	When you walk in it feels different from the normal chain hotels immediately. Very chique but not overly so. The bar area greats you and the check in staff and concierge were particularly helpful and polite.My room was one of the best I have stayed in and the room was enormous with lovely furnishings and wonderful bathroom......all you need PLUS a massive flatscreen TV!!!!!Down in the bar the staff were really attentive and the atmosphere relaxed.Didnt experience the restaurant but if it was like the rest of the experience it would be worth a visit
106,1085,"Jun 19 2009 	Excellent service well located	I have used this hotel many times over several years which will tell you that I have a high regard for it and the service that I have consistently received. With the disruption of a major refurbishment now long passed, I can confirm that all concerned have sought not only to maintain service quality to the previous high levels but have managed to exceed them. I find the front-of-house reception always welcoming and helpful, without becoming overbearingly obsequious, while any query or request has without fail received the necessary attention.Rooms are spacious and well equipped (including air conditioning), with suitable sound-proofing to keep the traffic noise to a minimum.The hotel is ideally situated to allow walking access to the varied delights of Theatreland, Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Soho while the proximity (5 mins) of Tottenham Court Road station allows easy entry to the underground system.Finally, given the general excellence of service, I must nevertheless make special mention of Kumar, the Guest Relations Manager, and Aaron in the breakfast room, for their helpfulness and willingness to engage with guests, thereby setting an exceptional standard of customer care for their colleagues to match."
107,1085,"Jun 16 2009 	Nice hotel but poor management	On arrival we were given a room that did not match the reservation - a small dark room with only one small window at the end of a deep alcove that opened directly onto a noisy installation (ventilation system?). We phoned to reception for another room and we were quickly offered another and better room. We were told it was also an upgrade but it only seemed more like the standard we had reserved in the first place. Within just about 15 minutes there was knocking on the door from two men who said they were maintenance staff in response to a reported leak. Having heard of tricksters saying they were maintenance staff to come into rooms, we said we would have to call reception to check. Meanwhile a manager came and confirmed it was genuine and one of the men made a quick check of the bathroom but found nothing amiss.Next day we returned to the room at about 2pm to find the key-cards didn't work and a passing maid couldn't make them work either, so we had to go to reception and get new ones, and when we got in our room found it hadn't been made up. Apparently, housekeeping hadn't been informed the room was now occupied (although we had switched on the green light to indicate the room was ready for cleaning).Next day the same thing happened - the key-cards didn't work and a manager had to bring up a third set. This time the room was made up but there were no cups replaced so we had to phone down again for some. We didn't bother to complain about the tv not working properly (channels would suddenly cut out and/or the picture break up).On departure we were told an email with apologies would be sent to us, but one never came (now 9 days ago). The hotel was otherwise of a good standard in a good location, and the staff was very friendly and helpful in their manner, but over all the experience was not what we had expected for a 4 star hotel in the West End."
108,1085,"Jun 15 2009 	What a lovely upgraded hotel !	Stayed for 2 nights on the way back from St. Petersburg - prepaid internet rate was 345 pounds for 2 nights inclusive of taxes, complimentary newspaper but excluded breakfast but included complimentary internet in the rooms. Hotel has just recently undergone major refurbishment and was really nice and very well furnished with a separate walk in closet area. Room was not spacious but was very adequate. Location was excellent for access to Covent Garden and the West End. We love West End shows and the restaurants at Covent Garden and Chinatown - all within a 10 min walk."
109,1085,"Jun 15 2009 	Very comfortable stay	Stayed for 2 nights in a superior room, which although a little small, was very comfortable and clean.The bathroom was spacious, clean with an excellent shower.The breakfast was reasonable enough, and included in our room rate. The cooked English breakfast could have been a little warmer, and I would have been disappointed if I had paid the 17 menu price. However, tried the pancake option the next morning, which was very nice. However, there were a good choice of additional breakfast options, and service was quick and attentive.As has been mentioned, very convenient for both the British Museum and Covent Garden, and short taxi drive to St Pancras station for Train and Euro Tunnel links.We found the staff to be very pleasant indeed, and credit to the barstaff who whipped up a mean Mojito. Didn't try the restaurant but the bar meals were very agreeable.Will be our London hotel of choice for future visits"
110,1085,Jun 12 2009 	Great service in ideal spot	Excellent service from a friendly and knowledgable team. Will definately use again if up again
111,1085,"Jun 12 2009 	Ideal location with exellent help from the Hotel staff	We came with freinds for a Westend show and arrived very early but our rooms where vacant so checked in the where Staff so very helpful , the rooms very modern with all we needed ( very quiet hard to find in hotels these days ) We had all our meals at the hotel very good choice both breakfast &amp; dinner and on departure we left out luggage for the whole day until train time home an excellent experience all round we will stay again ."
112,1085,"Jun 7 2009	excellent hotel cool design more like a boutique hotel . pricey but its London	We had an excellent stay, the hotel staff were excellent, the design of reception area and bar is fantastic. we were given a smoking room instead of non smoking, but the staff were delightful and the manager attended to the problem.The bar super, even if just one person you could go and sit in it, very sumptuous.Fabulous location, near oxford st, covent garden and many other places.Make sure you book early to get good price as it is expensive. although not too bad for London."
113,1085,"Jun 4 2009 	The perfect weekend!	Our trip to London was to see We Will Rock You (a brilliant show and one I would definitely recommend) and to meet friends. On our arrival at the hotel our room wasn't quite ready and immediately tea and coffee appeared with compliments of the hotel. I absolutely loved the little cast iron teapot. The staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Our room, an upgrade, was very spacious and extremely comfortable and our walk in rain shower was huge. Bliss! As someone with MS, space to move around easily is essential and I later realised we'd been moved to a much nicer room so I owe the reception manager (I think that's his title) a huge thank you. I appreciate all the extra effort he went to.The breakfast was exceptionally good and the breakfast manager (I think that was his title) who had served us the tea and coffee the previous day had obviously remembered our conversation because porridge appeared almost without me having to order it. Scrumptious. The cooked buffet was hot, very fresh and had an excellent selection. My husband said it was the best breakfast he'd had in a hotel in a long time. The cold buffet was just as good and there was plenty of different freshly cut fruit to choose from. An excellent start to the day.The hotel is walking distance, even for someone with MS, to Covent Garden and the West End so the location is brilliant and there is lots to see and do nearby. If you can't walk that far there are lots of bikes that could be hired and take you wherever you need to go and they're more fun than a taxi. The British Museum is just across the road and the garden is a really nice place to sit and people watch or just experience the beautiful building and artefacts.It was the perfect weekend and we are already planning another theatre trip. We will definitely go back to the hotel again and hopefully very soon. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay perfect!"
114,1085,Jun 3 2009 	good service rooms really only for 2	great service rooms suitable for 2 only cleangreat location
115,1085,"Jun 2 2009 	Outstanding Service	I stayed at the Hotel as part of a two day meeting and i was very impressed at the level of service, the standards set and the fantastic facilties the hotel had to offer.The staff was very polite and helpful and put themselves out to help in anyway they could.Rooms was superb, clean, spacious and had all the mod cons (Internet, Wireless Access, Large LCD TV etc)One of the best parts is the meals served in the restaurant, which had been prepared to the highest standards and food that caterred for everyones taste. Overall top marks, and i will certainly use the hotel again in the near future."
116,1085,"May 31 2009 	Stylish comfortable friendly efficient staff	This hotel is situatred in the heart of theatre land. It is clean and stylish. The staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient. I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and would definitely advise others to go."
117,1085,"May 25 2009 	Great location	Friendly,clean and central hotel with comfortable and small but good bathroom"
118,1085,"May 23 2009 	A comfortable new hotel in a good location	We stayed a few nights in March. The hotel is very newly refurbished and has modern decor. The room was quite small, but not sure how this compares in London. The bathroom was enormous and fantastic (except for the hairdryer which - bizarrely - is powered into a draw in the wardrobe in the bedroom!). The hotel is walking distance to British Museum, Covent Garden, Oxford Street etc. It's a good base for exploring on foot. The internet didn't work when we were there, but we could use the internet at the sister hotel just across the street. When we checked out they charged the wrong rate - saying the rate fluctuates daily! After a few minutes and after they checked the rate on the check-in form and my booking confirmation it was fixed and the overcharging refunded - so no major dramas - but suggest guests keep an eye on it when checking out."
119,1085,"May 22 2009 	Perfect Location	Shopping or theatre land ? This is the hotel. Just a few minutes easy walk to shops/ theatres./museums. In fact from here you could walk to almost any London attraction but buses and underground are on hand. Totally renovated to a very high standard, staff really helpfull. Full Breakfast has everything you could want. Very good value for money"
120,1085,"May 20 2009 	Very nice hotel - much better than anticipated	We originally booked at the Radisson Edwardian Kenilworth but, on arrival, were redirected to the Bloomsbury Street hotel which was just across the road.The hotel has been refurbished recently and is in first class condition in the rooms and in the public areas. The rooms are of a reasonable size for a short stay (slightly larger than many I have stayed in) and are very modern, clean and well equipped.Reception staff were efficient and helpful and all other staff were very friendly.The hotel is conveniently located for Covent Garden and the West End theatres."
121,1085,"May 19 2009 	They've got it absolutely right	I booked the hotel for a romantic birthday treat for my wife. I paid a bit more for a deluxe room, but boy was it worth it. The room was a reasonable size, much larger than I'm use to in London. The decor was modern and fresh and the room spotlessly clean. My wife is always fussy about the bathroom and even she couldn't find anything to complain about!!! There were no cups in the room to make tea/coffee, mentioned it to reception and it was rectified by the time we got back, so really not a problem. We were going out for afternoon tea and the theatre so didn't get a chance to sample the restaurant and was gutted when we saw the menu as I think we missed a great opportunity, the menu sounded great and very reasonable, the head chef, Redmond Hayward has an excellent reputation and I would urge you to try the menu as I think it would be worth it. If you haven't booked yet, why not?????"
122,1085,"May 18 2009 	much much better	Having stayed at this hotel in March and being very disappointed. I was persuaded by the hotel manager to give them a second chance.This time the hotel was faultless. Check in was quick and painless, and after about 15 mins of being in my room room service arrived with a bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine. Which was a nice touch. The room was comfortable and quiet. And the bar was the same as before. friendly staff and not too overpriced for a West End bar. In fact everytime I walked by a member of staff they greeted me with a smile and a cheery hello.The location of this hotel is excellent. Just a short walk to Soho where I always have a great time.I will definately be going back soon."
123,1085,"May 17 2009 	Superb Hotel and Great Staff	having arrived after an overnight flight from the US into Heathrow and heading into central London was pleasantly surprised that at 9.30am the front desk team had a room ready for me.The receptionist was helpful and gracious and check in was speedily completed.2nd pleasant surprise was the room - newly refurbished, well laid out and clean.After a quick unpack and shower in the well appointed bathroom i hit the mattress for a sound 3 hour sleep.Room facilities were excellent and the in-room directory informative. The quiet ambiance of the lounge bar was the perfect way to have a pre- sleep tippleChecking out the following day, I was able to leave my luggage securely as I did around 4 hours of shopping.Can not praise the staff highly enough - made me feel welcome and I will hopefully be back in the near future."
124,1085,"May 16 2009 	The best stay in London I have ever had!	This hotel was a dream, I stayed for a long weekend with 3 girlfriends and it was made very memorable by the quality of the rooms we had and the friendly efficient service we received. The location was ideal, within easy walking distance of top London attractions and hot shopping spots. We enjoyed days out aided by the concierge who gave us loads of tips on where to go and how to get there, and knew we would end our day in the comfort of the beautifully decorated and comfortable lounges, bar and bedrooms of the hotel. Thank you to everyone there for making it the best trip to London I have ever had!"
125,1085,May 13 2009 	Great hotel within walking distance of Covent Garden	I recently stayed in this very modern hotel which has been totally refurbished from last year and the standard of rooms and service is first class. A large selection at breakfast and very tasty fresh food. The staff were very friendly and courteous. It is in a superb location as it only takes about 10 -15 minutes to walk to Covent Garden and Leicester Square. Overall I thoroughily enjoyed my stay and will definitely visit again.
126,1085,"May 11 2009 	Jersey boys trip	Booked the hotel because of is proximity to the Prince Edwards theatre. Hotel was excellent, staff lovely and location great. Would recommend it.Jersey Boys was also amazing. Woudl use Hotel again ,and go to the show again.Also if you want the British Museum, couldn't be closer - just cross the road, and about 200yards along, you're there."
127,1085,"May 10 2009 	A superb hotel for a lady on business travelling alone	The team at the hotel were excellent. Professional, polite and polished. A lovely hotel, excellent cuisine with beatifully furnished and highly clean and comfortable rooms. I would love to stay here again with my family on a holiday trip to the city."
128,1085,May 2 2009 	A Great London choice	Near to Tottenham Court Road Subway Station. 100 m to British Museum.50 m to Oxford Street.Great continental breackfast.
129,1085,"Apr 24 2009 	Everything that you want but don't expect from a London Hotel	Arrived at 11.00 to be welcomed &amp; told my room was ready, not what I'm used to. Staff extremely polite &amp; efficient. Everything in Hotel is brand new &amp; it shows. Breakfast was one of the best I have had, all hot &amp; fresh, eggs cooked to order &amp; correctly (again a welcome change)Location is ideal, 2 mins from Tottenham Court Road Tube. If you are in London, it is worth paying for a quality hotel &amp; in this caser, that is exactly what you get!"
130,1085,"Apr 8 2009 	Very very comfortable beautifully refurbished in great location	The Radisoon Bloomsbury was an excellent hotel in London. It has been beautifully refurbished, the rooms are gorgeous, the staff are attentive and breakfast is lovely. Very close to the theatre district so take a show in while you stay there!"
131,1085,"Apr 6 2009 	Friendly comfortable and convenient	The hotel is situated a slight walk away from Tottenham Court Road, and although difficult to find initially, the staff are welcoming and pleasant. I have stayed here on two different occasions, once booking a Queen Suite, and once being offered an upgrade to a Kings Suite. Both visits were extremely friendly, reception and room service staff were delightful and offered advice on surrounding areas, as were management who were quick to help with any problems.For people travelling with partners, the rooms are ideal and cosy, quiet and comfortable. The hotel becomes an ideal break from the hectic city life, and yet everything remains at a close distance if needed."
132,1085,"Apr 3 2009 	Solid comfort.	Emerging from its major refurbishment, Radisson's fresh Bloomsbury Street Hotel (former Marlborough) offers comfortable accommodation, great breakfasts, a fine restaurant, attentive and courteous staff, in a convenient central London location. Size, comfort, work area, and storage space of individual rooms varies."
133,1085,Mar 31 2009 	very welcoming hotel with excellent positions and value for money	I stayed for few weeks in this hotel. The young staff was just incredibly welcoming and helpfull (special thank to Monika from the front desk helping me out with many issues I faced during my long term stay in this hotel). Beside that the hotel is just 2 minutes walk from Oxford Streed. I definately recomend this place.
134,1085,"Mar 30 2009 	Great experience	One of the best city centre hotels I have ever stayed in. I have never stayed in London before but have travelled to many European and North American cities. The room was not the biggest, but was very good. Tastefully decorated and furnished and had everything needed for a short city break, iron, hairdrier, mirrors in useful places, good lighting etc. The bathroom also was excellent, good shower and plenty of room for toiletries. Location also was great for theatre, transport and places of interest. Picked for proximity to Royal Opera House. Staff friendly and helpful.Would use this hotel again and would recommend without hesitation."
135,1085,Mar 30 2009 	Excellent hotel in perfect location	My husband and I stayed here on a recent trip to London to see a show and we were not dissapointed. The hotel is easily found if you travel to Tottenham Court Road tube station and perfectly located for Theatreland - 5-10mins to Shaftesbury Ave. We arrived early but booking in was not a problem - room was very nice if not a little small but it had everything that was needed and you could tell it had recently been refurbished. We ate in the hotel that evening and had a very reasonably priced meal - they even ensured that we were served quickly to ensure we got out in plently of time for the show. The only slight problem was we made a reservation in advance and they had no record of this - however it was not a problem and they got us a table very quickly. All in all an excellent hotel in a great location for a very reasonable price. Will definately stay again!
136,1085,"Mar 28 2009 	Too bad about the service	Nice hotel. Great location. Nothing quite works. We stayed here for 8 nights... room upgrade gave us an extra long hallway to the bed room, and we had to ask for everything. Case in point(s): coffee is provided on first day, but you have to haggle for it after that, business centre consists of two old (er) PCs on a shelf, no printing, the internet in the room works if you wander around and get a signal and it constantly shuts out, and room cleaning consists of NOT cleaning any of the glasses/cups one uses but making the bed, and finally, if you order room service, be prepared to wait for it to come from YORKSHIRE. That said, bathroom was a really nice size and the gym was very much usable. Concierge decidedly absent."
137,1085,"Mar 27 2009 	Great Location - Wonderful Accomodations	This was my first trip to London and my first encounter with European hotels (room-size!)I traveled there with my 15 year old son and we requested a twin room. We were not offered any upgrades at arrival - but that was OK. We were granted early check-in which was great. After flying all night, riding the tube from Heathrow, and then walking from the station, we needed to just rest for an hour or two. The room was small, but very nice. The beds were nice and firm. My son did not like his pillow - for some reason he got a down pillow and the feathers kept poking him in the face. The bathroom was lovely! No problem with the water pressure at all. We opted to include breakfast with our room - and that was a good decision. Never had to wait and the staff were very pleasant. You could choose from the buffet or special order if you wished. Good supply of fruit, cereal, etc. We had room service 2 evenings and the food was delicious. I do wish though that they would have larger size sodas and use more ice!The hotel is in a great location. One block from the British Museum, 10 minutes from Covent Garden, 5-10 minutes from Soho. Lots of restaurants and shops around. The stop for the double-decker tour bus is right down the street.The staff were all very friendly. Gary, the concierge, was extremely helpful with information about tours, where to exchange money, and just general information. There must have been some construction going on - because we were woken every morning by banging and drilling. Good thing that we are early risers. Our room overlooked an apartment building - so no street noise. But, not much of a view. We most likely could have switched rooms - but I didn't see the point.The hotel has a &quot;business center&quot; - 2 computers in an alcove; but, they were easily accessible. Wireless internet is free at the hotel - which is a plus. Many other hotels charge around 20 pounds a day.Overall, a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay there again."
138,1085,"Mar 26 2009 	Nice surprise	was concerned what to expect , but was very nicely surprised with this modern hotel, decent room sizes ( especially for London) and good service. Likely to be rechecking in, especially with good location for Covent Gardens"
139,1085,"Mar 22 2009 	We enjoyed our stay immensely.	We are from Canada and stayed eight days. This was previously an older hotel that has now been totally and beautifully renovated. Our room was bright (lots of windows), spacious (for London standards) and well-appointed including the bathroom with it's contemporary fixtures, marble and glass features. The hotel staff were attentive, cheerful, hard working and very accommodating, even to promptly hailing cabs for us when time was tight. The concierge was very helpful arranging tours, dinner reservations and general advice about London. The morning host in the dining room had us seated promptly and easily attended to any dietary differences. The breakfast was great....fresh, tasty and appealing. It was nice each morning to have 2 London newspapers plus the Wall Street Journal available to us. The housekeeping staff were very efficient however lots of corridor noise in the mornings especially when we tried to sleep late! The front desk staff, while very pleasant, appeared somewhat disorganized and the internet/computers in the business centre were largely inoperative during our stay which was quite inconvenient since we were travelling without laptops (NB: we've since contacted the management about the housekeeping/corridor noise and the front desk/business centre issues and we were promptly reassured that both are now under control). The location is easy walking distance to almost anything in central London...Brit Museum one block away, Covent Garden, Leicester, Trafalgar, &quot;Tate&quot;, a multitude of great shops, restaurants and theatre. We look forward to a return visit to London and staying at this hotel."
140,1085,Mar 21 2009 	One blip expertly remedied; will be back	We booked direct through the Radisson website and the rate was reasonable for a hotel of this standard in this great location. We were there for our anniversary and the blip was that the concierge did not supply the flowers my partner had ordered in advance of my arrival which was a disappointment but the desk staff handled it expertly with a complimentary treat from room service. The hotel has been refurbished beautifully and our room was a wee bit tight but had a huge bathroom. One niggle which might put off light sleepers is the almost constant drone from an air vent in the bathroom; this does not seem to be controllable and might be part of the central air conditioning system. The staff appear to be expertly trained and the charming young man who delivered our treat was testament to this as was the professional young woman on the front desk who dealt with our complaint.The location is great and if we secure the same sort of deal again (or better) we will certainly be happy to use it as a base for a London weekend or on business.
141,1085,"Mar 19 2009 	Great location price and quality!	Though the rooms are small (which is expected in London), they were very well decorated, clean, and included all the emenities."
142,1085,Mar 19 2009 	An excellent place to stay	We were well looked after from arrival to departure in this very stylishly furnished though still comfortable hotel.The food was was of a high standard as was the service.
143,1085,"Mar 16 2009 	Great hotel Location 	We only stayed one night but chose the hotel as it offered good value and a location just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street &amp; Covent Garden. Staff were very efficient, especially the Concierge. Bar stays open until 2a.m. Drinks are pricey but the norm for hotels in Central London. We didn't eat Breakfast so can't comment on the food. Very sleek and modern rooms. Great showers etc. Would definately stay again!"
144,1085,"Mar 12 2009 	Ideal location for trip to the theatre and close to covent garden.	We chose this hotel because of its location to the theatre and found it to be only five mintues away!! Also close to Covent Garden and othertheatres, and Im sure we will stay here again for that reason. Hotel room was very comfortable and clean."
145,1085,"Mar 8 2009 	Great Hotel Good Location	Excellent Hotel in a good location, great for theatre breaks.The hotel has recently been renovated to an excellent standard, bright and airy. The check in procedure was nice and simple with pleasant staff, although one member of the staff struggled to understand simple English, annoying but par for the course in London. Faulty Towers moments a plenty.The room we stayed in (deluxe queen) was on the first floor and was nicely decorated, ample sized and equipped with everything you'd need, except... a mirror near to a power point which really frustrated my other half as she needed to use her GHD's before facing the world. However being ingenious (and desperate) she managed to unscrew the shaving mirror in the bathroom using nothing but her bare hands and taking it into the bedroom... I would have just rang the concierge who I'm sure would have found one from somewhere!The wall mounted flat screen tv was ok but had limited channels couldn't even get the news which some people might find annoying. The bed was really comfy big enough for the queen in fact...The bathroom in our room was enormous with lots of hanging space. Unfortunately though, the bath over flow had become lose meaning water would have leaked onto the granite floor. Fortunately for Radisson I fixed it prior to using the fantastic shower which i could have stayed in all day... if i had the time i would have ! The bath was tiny and shallow which was a real shame as the bathroom was so large and opulent the small bath kind of let it all down.We didnt bother paying for the breakfast as we thought 17 per head each day was not worth it. Instead we popped around the corner onto Oxford Street and had a full breakfast and drinks for 7 each.The bar was about average for London price wise, about 9 for 2 small bottles of Magners and the service was what you'd expect in splendid surroundings.We did use room service one night but after 11pm the menu was a bit limited.We had a chicken salad baguette and chips for about 10, but it had to be done...We went to see Chicago which was only a 10 min walk away to the south and very easy to find on foot, Euston Station was only round the corner and about 8.0 in a cab. The nearest tube is just around the corner, Tottenham court road.All in all we had an excellent stay at this hotel and would not hesitate recommending to a friend, no doubt we would stay there again."
146,1085,"Mar 7 2009 	A London Hotel With Personality!	London hotels are often overpriced with poor or barely adequate service and whilst this one isn't cheap, it doesn't leave a nasty taste in your mouth when you check out.The hotel has been completely refurbished and whilst the rooms (like most London hotel rooms) aren't large, these are really very stylish, as are the public areas.It's also in a fantastic location - a ten minute walk from Leicester Square and literally two minutes from the British Museum.Check in was friendly and professional. We were offered an upgrade for a 'discounted' rate, which we took - not sure I'd bother next time but Carmen on the front desk was quite persuasive and effectively earnt the hotel an extra 60. :-) We asked for a change of room, because the first room we were allocated was on the front of the hotel and we'd asked for a quiet room when we made the original booking. This was done immediately without attitude and we were phoned later to ensure we were happy with our room. Our 'deluxe' room was very nice with a king sized bed and large bathroom. And although it probably didn't warrant the extra cost (it didn't include a separate shower cubicle, for example) it did come with a lot of the 'niceties' including king sized bed, bath robes, mini bar and safe.We dined in the restaurant, which (again for London) we thought offered good value for money. It cost about 50.00 per head for three courses with wine, but the food was excellent and interesting. I had the lamb, which comprised beautifully cooked lamb fillets and a mini Moussaka - it was without doubt one of the top three dishes I've eaten this year. (And we do eat out a lot!)And although breakfast was the standard buffet affair, it was better than most.The second night we booked theatre tickets on the way back from a business meeting, which left us just 60 minutes to each and change. We ordered room service explaining our predicament and, as promised, it arrived within 20 minutes. Exceptional service again.As I've hinted, the thing that really set this hotel apart from all of the others I've stayed at in London over the last 10 years was the fact that the hotel seems to have worked hard to find and train staff who are polite, professional and friendly! In fact everyone we had contact with within the hotel was excellent and worked hard to make our stay enjoyable and problem free. Julia who acted as Maitre D on both days was fun and personable. The gentleman who looked after us at dinner was very friendly as were the bar staff too. This wasn't the usual anonymous customer service you get in large hotels - all of these people asked questions, engaged in conversation and showed an interest in their customers. In short this was service with personality, which sadly is all too rare.This will definitely be the first hotel I consider for future trips to London."
147,1085,"Mar 6 2009 	Extraordinary in every way	As you walk in a young dynamic team of receptionists welcome you to this modern, &quot;fen shuei feel&quot; hotel in the heart of Londons West End, next door (and I mean across the street) from the British Museum. Rooms were spotless, the bathrooms lovely and with large rain-like shower head. Flat screen TV's and free in room WIFI. Check in and out were hastle-free. And the hotel is walking distance from Covent Garden, Chinatown, Leicester Square....."
148,1085,"Mar 5 2009 	Electrocution... No Heat... at a 4-star hotel!	Awful. When I arrived, I was offered a room upgrade. I decided it was a decent offer. How wrong was I... My room had no heat. I discovered a leak coming through a light socket in the shower... while I was in it!!!! Asked room service three times over a period of three days to clear out the mini-bar with no success. Finally had to go directly to the concierge to have him send someone up immediately to take care of it. Had multiple line item charges on my bill because of the above-mentioned mini-bar fiasco. No communication happening between day shift and night shift. Oh, and did I mention, the habit of housekeeping of leaving behind dirty dishes... Three days in a row and counting. Please, can I have a clean coffee cup!!! I still have two days left on my stay here and am very much regretting my choice of this hotel. While the location is optimal if you want to be near the BM, Covent Garden, the service, the staff, the quality of the rooms are not worth the price. I'm in a &quot;superior room&quot; and this has been the worst hotel experience I've had after multiple business trips to London. If you want a 4-star hotel in the center of London, don't come here."
149,1085,"Mar 4 2009 	Great location nice large well appointed room	A perfect location for a weekend in town - walking distance to major shopping areas, West End (theaters), lots of restaurants, cafes and bars. Very friendly and welcoming staff.The room I had was - for London standards - quite large, very well maintained (must have been completely refurbished only very recently) and nicely decorated. Bed was comfortable, noise level from outside negligible (make sure you get a room looking to the courtyard, otherwise you will look onto a fairly busy street). Bathroom was modern, freshly refurbished, had all amenities you would expect, and was perfectly clean.Overall - I definitely would come back and can recommend the hotel without restrictions."
150,1085,Mar 4 2009 	Perfect for my first trip to London	Great location and value in a brand new hotel...I'll go back
151,1085,"Feb 22 2009 	Glad it was only a short stay	I spent one night her in February for a quick work trip. I had a late dinner with clients and didn't arrive at the hotel until midnight, so luckily I literally just slept and took a shower the next morning and was gone by 8am. The check-in staff was very nice and although they ask you a lot of questions like phone number, address, email (didn't they get this when I made my reservation?), it was still efficient.The location is very convenient to my office in Covent Garden and is also central to most of the West End sights. Usually for business I choose a 4-star hotel, but this was a last minute trip and since I was booking the day before, most places were expensive. I ended up taking the Secret Hotel on Last Minute for 105.Based on how much all the other hotels were, I guess I was satisfied with the value and obviously I know how expensive London hotels are, but I still think 105 was a rip-off for the room I stayed in. I was put in a twin room, which I had actually never experienced anywhere before. It reminded me very much of an inside cabin on a cruise ship. Two twin beds, a chest of drawers that was also a desk that also had like 7 different switches on it for different lights, hair dryer etc. The TV was really basic. There was a closet right when you entered the room. The bathroom was extremely small and there is no way 2 people could have been in at the same time. The shower was on that has the folding door, barely enough room for you to raise your arms to wash your hair. It's not so much that I can't handle small spaces, but there was no room to put anything. It was just a sink, no shelf anywhere in the bathroom and no room to balance my toilettrie kit on the edge.It was fine for a one night stay that literally just involved sleeping and a shower, but overall the quality was not very good at all. There were stains on the carpet and the blankets were thin and poor quality. They looked like they had been cleaned, but there were old stains that looked like they wouldn't come out on the white blanket cover.I feel like I can handle a less than superior hotel if necessary, but I will not be booking this hotel again in the future when I travel to my London office. I saw some much nicer hotels that were available for 30 more and I would definitely book one of those in the future."
152,1085,"Feb 14 2009	Great LocationGreat Staff	I stayed 13 nights at this hotel with a theatre tour group. Our room was newly furnished with comfy twin beds,tv,two desks,one for each of us,a fridge,iron and ironing board. It was quiet,elegant,convenient. There is an ATM across the street,two free computers in the lobby for the use of guests, a lavish breakfast buffet, daily newspapers,speedy elevators,and a cheerful,responsive staff. Our room was cleaned while we ate breakfast.The housekeeping staff took care of every request at once.(I needed a rubber floor mat in the shower) The maid cleared out the mini-fridge contents so we could keep our own fruit and beverages in it during our stay. This hotel is within walking distance of the British Museum,Covent Garden, plus many ethnic restaurants and even a Sainsbury's supermarket."
153,1085,"Feb 9 2009	Good location and comfortable stay	Excellent location, just a short walk to Convent Garden, British Museum and theatres.I arrived during the morning to drop my bag but was offered to check-in as there was a room available. The (standard) room was small but perfectly adequate for one, with a comfortable double bed. It was tastefully furnished and the bathroom was stylish and spotlessly clean. I do have three small points that I only mention because the hotel is newly refurbished and these should have been considered at the design phase. There are only 2 small lifts. I think this is inadequate for a hotel of this size and sometimes you had to wait. The door latches made it impossible to close the door quietly and you could hear doors closing down the corridor. Finally there was no proper bedside light in my room. A switch by the bed just turned on an overhead spotlight - not very restful! I didn't try the bar or restaurant, but Wagamama is just across the street which was useful for a quick post-theatre meal.On balance I would stay here again, and the weekend rate is good value."
154,1085,Feb 7 2009 	Good hotel! Thanks!	Great location. Nice and helpful people. Beautiful interiors. Good food. What more do you want!!!
155,1085,"Feb 5 2009	Loved it	We were fourteen ladies who had booked the hotel for a weekend in London. First impression was wow and was then greeted by very attentive staff who couldn't do enough for us. The rooms are beautifully decorated with plenty of space and comfortable, also a great location five minute to Covent Garden, from there on you can walk to most tourist spots.Breakfast was plentiful and delicious and once again the staff were very helpful and service first class. I have and will recommend this hotel to family and friendsA special thanks to Gary who was so helpful"
156,1085,"Feb 4 2009 	Sparkling new	I stayed here for 2 nights on business. Location is superb, walking distance from Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, 5 mins in a taxi from Euston. This hotel is brand spanking new, I think I was the first person to stay in my room it felt that new (1015). Very comfortable bed (although after the first night I asked for non-feather pillows which didnt arrive, I couldnt be bothered to ask a second time). Previous review said it wasnt a power shower - maybe not but my shower was a huge rain head and very powerful anyway. Restaurant was excellent, extremely friendly and helpful waiting staff which is unusual for this type of hotel, food was very good quality and value for money. My only complaint is that I ordered room service breakfast on the first morning for 7.45. By 8am it hadnt arrived so I called room service to be told it was on it's way. It arrived 15 minutes later by which time I had to leave! The waiter was apologetic and said they were extremely busy that morning but I would rather have been told at 8am that it was 15 minutes away so I could have got breakfast on the go! Maybe it is just teething problems as it is so new. I didnt make the same mistake the second morning though and to be fair, the buffet breakfast was very good."
157,1085,"Jan 23 2009 	Luxurious but Hskeeping and FrontofHouse staff NEED customer service training	I stayed here over Xmas and New Year 2008 for 10 days. I am a Londoner and wanted somewhere central for the period so I could make all of my festive arrangments without travelling all over town for the period.The Hotel still had scaffolding up outside so the room rate was reduced q. dramatically .This was indeed an unexpected bonus as it is in a great location ( the original booking was for a different Radisson hotel which is about to go into refurb. mode so the travel company I booked through did a transfer for me without being asked - though they didn't advise me of this until i called them the day before !!!! - long story........ ). The room was very nice : comfortable bed + spotless furnishings ( the whole hotel has just had a 25 million pound refurb - and it's official opening date was 05/01/09 ) . The bathroom was v. luxurious , huge and spotlessly clean - beautiful marble + Axor fittings . The shower was really roomy and modern ( in a 'wet-room' style with an overhead faucet + a smaller seperate showerhead on the wall alongside : in effect 2 for 1) + there was seperate nice bath + double sink area .The shower head was large and all the fittings obviously brand new but it was NOT a power shower. Customers from the USA will recognise that fact as soon as they turn it on. Nothing wrong with it - just not a power shower as advertised .One drawback of this hotel : the housekeeping staff were INCREDIBLY NOISY !!!!!!!!! Each morning anytime between 6.30 - 8.30 you could hear them . Sometimes they were shouting to their colleagues . YES shouting to them along the corridors and on Xmas day when I had the DND light on they called me THREE times before noon asking when I would like my room cleaned . Obviously ignoring the DND light + the whole Xmas vibe . I had plans after 12 noon - not first thing in the morning on Xmas Day !!!!! Front of House staff : really not good enough. My electronic room card key kept malfunctioning and I had to go down the front desk ( from the 6th floor) each day when I got back to the hotel over a 4 day period. Instead of just replacing the card - they just kept clean- swiping it and re-issuing to me. Also, whenever I went down to the concierge desk there was either one person dealing with a long queue of check-in customers or 5 staff chatting to each other aimlessly.I presume this refurb was to attract new business or repeat returns. The rooms are great but all the staff need training. Didn't use the bar or restaurant as both ridiculously expensive and extremely 'dark' furnishings. The lighting is way too subdued. + There are so many fantastic places to eat in the surrounding areas that 17 pounds for breakfast is just outrageous.Apart from that it's a nice hotel. Would recommend for a short stay or business but not for anything over 4 days ."

1,1091,average	hotel clean &amp; well presented. easy access to 02 dlr then one tube stop. room service meal was very poor over priced &amp; not very good. breakfast also poor 17 per person for lukewarm cooked breakfast not ideal.
2,1091,Nov 19 2009 	Nice but mind the drinks	I have stayed in this hotel on a two occassions - the rooms are well appointed and the hotel has a fantastic location for the price. Weekends are very good value and we paid 69 for a Saturday night. Our first visit was marred by the 27 for two gin and tonics which included 12% service charge. I don't mind paying service but not when you have to wait at the bar for 15 minutes. By the way when I wrote to complain I was told that I should have expected high prices in a 4 start hotel.The second visit was better in that we were prepared for the prices at the bar and this time we actually had our drinks delivered to our table.
3,1091,"Nov 18 2009 	Great hotel great location a romantic break!!!	This is a nice hotel with a great view of the 02 arena just across the Thames. A suite is recommended for extra comfort as it has a large bed and large bathroom, what more do you need!!! What's more the onsite Spa facilities were superb and worth booking before you stay (half price with a room) We were thoroughly pampered and along with the friendly,helpful staff had a most relaxing and pleasant stay."
4,1091,"Nov 16 2009 	Elegant and very different from old City hotels with small rooms thick carpets and many doors.	Very serviceminded and friendly personnel and the most elegant pleasent rooms I have seen in London. For a meeting in the Dockland area, the hotel is perfect."
5,1091,"Nov 15 2009 	Modern but soleless hotel	Rooms were ok, facilities ok. For business it did the trick but you are too far from town for a leisure trip and there is nothing in the surrounding area. Car parking is awkward (valet) and it was expensive for a fairly run of the mill modern room."
6,1091,"Nov 13 2009 	Fabulous rooms attentive staff and superb location for o2 and ExCel	Wow, what a fantastic reception and entrance. This completely set the tone for my 3 night stay during WTM 2009.This hotel is a great base for ExCel and across the river from the o2. You have the choice of transport for getting to ExCel: the DLR from Blackwall is just 2 minutes walk, taxi's sit out front and you can walk to Custom House / ExCel in 25 minutes. This hotel is a brilliant base and the spacious, modern and clean rooms are complimented by friendly, efficient staff. The bar and restaurant provides very good food, however, there is also a good Italian just done the road."
7,1091,"Nov 10 2009 	Excellent service	I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during a business trip and I was completely satisfied with the room and the manner of staff who were always courteous. My room was comfortable,modern and spacious, breakfast was very good and I received a complimentary copy of my newspaper. I used the gym and I found it comfortable and well equipped though probably a bit packed at pick hours. I also recommend the spa centre the use of which is not free to guests of the hotel, but is a really enjoyable experience. I used the business centre and similar to the gym it was adequately equipped but probably a bit too small for such a big hotel, also at the time when I was staying the printer was not working (however, I was offered to use the one at reception instead). As a whole I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel which despite its convenient location only a 10 minutes away from Canary Wharf was really quiet and had the necessary amenities for the guest to relax after a long day. The only few things that can be improved are: air-conditioning which I found hard to adjust to the required temperature and also a bit noisy, toiletries which included a simple shampoo and no bath foam/shower cream, and the shuttle bus service which was a problem for our group as there were very few spaces in a car and only one car every 20-30 minutes."
8,1091,"Oct 25 2009 	Lovely Hotel Great Location Reasonable Price	My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in July. We booked it last minute through lastminute.com. We chose the &quot;Top Secret&quot; option and the Radison was what we got. We paid about 60pounds or $120 Canadian per night. We were booking last minute and were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, that wasn't horrid, and close to public transport. The prices of hotels in central London are crazy and you get really awful places if you choose the bargain options. We felt The Radison delivered in that it was a short train ride to central London, and was really lovely and clean for a price that was quite cheap for London in July.We were very pleased with the location. It is less than a 5 minute walk to the local DLR (DOcklands light railway) station. From the station it was a 25 min. ride into the central London. It was very quick and easy. The hotel is across the water from the O2 arena, so if you are taking in a show there, this is also a perfect hotel for the night. The hotel itself is brandnew, and very contemporary in design, with elegant decor that certainly was a cut above most other Radisson locations. The room was very spacious, had a large flat screen TV, a small stereo, insuite coffee, tea, minibar. Heated towel racks, large comfy bed with down duvet and tons of pillows. There was a trouser press, ironing board and iron, and a gorgeous bathroom with deep luxurious tub, as well as sleek shower room. All the little extras were provided, from qtips, to sewing kit, to shampoo and conditioner and lotion. The only drawback to this hotel is that its Docklands location means that its a bit out of the way and so trendy restaurants or bars didn't seem to be in abundance. This is not a nightlife location, but there are some restaurants and basic amenities near by and the hotel has a pool, and gym, bar and restaurant, so you wont be without. If you realize you are going to be taking the DLR into downtown and you can live with that in order to save a bit of money, then this is a beautiful, clean, brandnew hotel at a reasonable price."
9,1091,"Oct 24 2009 	fabulous river views very stylish hotel	We wanted a hotel near the O2 for a combined anniversary celebration and to see Spandau Ballet in concert, so I chose this hotel because it looked so stylish on the website. I wasn't wrong, the rooms and communal areas are like something out of 'Wallpaper' magazine, but not in any way pretentious as the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly.Because it was a special occasion I requested a river view as an afterthought just after booking and was delighted to find we'd been upgraded to one of - I believe - the best rooms in the hotel and were also surprised with a fabulous complimentary bottle of champagne, delivered to the room complete with ice bucket and chilled glasses!I'd thoroughly recommend asking for Room 330. We enjoyed glorious views of both the sunset and the sunrise over the river and the O2, the bed is huge and comfy, the bathroom is large and luxurious and also overlooks the river, and the hotel in general was surprisingly serene and quiet. We appreciated the fact that you couldn't hear any noise in the corridor thanks to the extra thick carpet.All of the communal areas were sleek and stylish, and the breakfast buffet was varied with a good selection of quality food. We were lucky enough to have great weather and a beautiful autumn morning the day we left so we chilled out outside later with hot chocolate which came with a sliver of delicious cheesecake. Funnily enough we were both too full to investigate the fitness centre! The business centre was great though as we both needed, sadly, to keep in touch with work.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes quality and modern styling. It's also incredibly close to the O2 via public transport. Blackwall station is the nearest as you can even see the hotel from there. For other places to eat, it's best to walk to Canary Wharf, about 10 minutes away. This is worth knowing as there are only a handful of restaurants (other than the one at the hotel) close by and they only open at peak times, it seems.If I were to improve this hotel in any way I'd say perhaps some of the staff, while polite, could be just a tiny bit more on the ball at times and the in-room guides, while elegantly designed, need a rethink as the pages kept falling out of the binders! These are minor quibbles as overall I think we received excellent value for money and enjoyed a lovely, truly memorable stay."
10,1091,"Oct 18 2009 	Best hotel I have ever stayed in!	I had a lovely stay in this hotel, very modern and clean. We stayed in one of the suite rooms and it was by far the swankiest hotel I have ever stayed in! Bathroom was really modern with a huge bath and walk in shower. I wish I could have stayed there another night! Having read other reviews and from our experience, the hotels location is the only slight downside. We got a taxi from canary wharf as we could not find the hotel by walking. The taxi cost 5. But when we ventured out again we used the dlr from blackwall which was useful. What I would say is although this hotel is slightly more out of the way I really want to stay there again! If this hotel was right in the centre of London you would have to pay so much more money. This is a fantastic hotel and you would gave to pay an extra 100/200 for a hotel of this class in central London. I am already looking at taking another trip here in December, very very pleased."
11,1091,"Oct 13 2009 	Terrific Week-end	We spent two nights here when we attended Andre Boccelli concert in the O2. Great to be so convenient to the venue, less hassle with trains and not too expensive for taxi's. Would benefit from having a water taxi as they overlook the Thames and are just a stones throw from the venue by water, cut out the troublesome tunnel. The service charge did hike up the prices so it would be an idea if the staff actually gave you the option to add this, thing Treating Customers Fairly and everything being clear.Enjoyed our short stay, the staff were very pleaseant and easy going and made us very welcome. Thank you from the Isle of Man"
12,1091,"Oct 1 2009 	cliff richard show	We stayed at the Radisson Edwardian for one night , excellent location , good service , good position for the O2 arean, breafastfast was good nice view of the river thames, not far from the tower, can go by river or train. Good value for money."
13,1091,"Oct 1 2009 	A total waste of money	I attended a reunion function at the weekend for doctors who trained at the Royal Free. Having stayed at Radissons in Glasgow and elsewhere I expected a certain level of service and care from this hotel. I could not have been more wrong. Just note anybody who is going there, they will make a service charge for paying for drinks at the bar (12.5%). When I questioned the general manager I was told that on the receipt it says it is discrectionary but I did not receive the bill until AFTER I had paid! There are NO signs saying there was an optional service charge going to be made. When I said this to the general manager he made no comment. At the table a friend and I ordered wine, after paying for this I noticed they had brought the wrong white wine. I was told I had incorrectly placed the order, yet we had both told the waiter and pointed out to him what we wanted. He told me it didn't matter as we would not be able to taste the difference!!! I asked him to bring the wine list over as I had told him which number and I wanted to prove to him that we had ordered correctly. He disappeared and never returned. And we were charged 12.5% service charge for this treatment. A consultant on our table wanted to share a glass of wine with a colleague but all the glasses had been cleared away, when he asked for some new glasses he was told that they were all in the dishwasher and there were no more available (this gets more strange by the minute). When he insisted, the waiter brought A tumbler. Another friend buying drinks at the bar was charged 3 different prices for the same drink! The meal was unbelieveable, the starter a diabolical smoked fish dish followed by at best what could only described as a mediocre main course and the pudding, what can I say. This was a poached pear but not like any poached pear I had ever tasted before. It was so unripe and uncooked we had to try and cut this with a knife and fork (and with difficulty)! If we were not with so many friends and colleagues I would have strongly complained then and there but I left it until the Monday. The general manager asked me to put it in writing on an email, which I did but as yet I have had no reply. I intend to contact the rest of people who attended and get their views (I already know many that have already complained to me). This was not an isolated incident as everyone else experienced the same kind of prob lems and worse."
14,1091,"Sep 24 2009 	Excelent hotel with excelent staff	We stayed here as we were going to a show in the O2. This was our first visit to this hotel and I must say how impressed we were with the service we received. The staff were extremely friendly and efficient. When we checked in, our room had been upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise! The quality of the room and bathroom were superb and we definitely would recommend this hotel."
15,1091,"Sep 15 2009 	good customer service - yeah right!	Me and my partner arrived at this hotel, looked pleasant and we thought we would have the best weekend ever! Oh wrong were we! The valet service parked our car for us, checked in and stayed in a one bedroom suite. Rooms were nice, clean, spacious.. everything we were expecting... Then the problems started!I had booked a take two package at the recommended spa, which looked beautiful.. but left my partner feeling relaxed on only one side of his body! The full body massage he recieved for some reason only meant massaging one leg not the other - which is funny as being a qualified beauty therapist i am 100% sure a full body massage involves massaging both legs not just one. This was presented as a misunderstanding on part of the therapist as she could not understand english properly when my partner said only his ankle was to be massaged lightly. After getting ready to go out in the evening, we made a call to reception to bring our car to the front.. only to be told that the car was not starting! After going to see whats wrong with the car (as we had arrived to the hotel in the same car with no problems), my partner was spoken to very rudely by the duty manager called Tibor. We were told its our fault that the car did not start, as their valet service could not have done anything wrong! On inspecting the car, my partner found the lights in the car were left on (which we did not switch on as we had arrived in daylight) effectively killing the car battery. We were still told it was our fault! To top it off, Tibor started giving his own advice as to what he thought we did to the car ( as he obviously was a trained mechanic ). After waiting around for ages, and being talked down to by this manager, we were finally called a cab to take us to where we should have been an hour earlier. When staying at a hotel with such a well known brand name attached to it, one would expect impeccible customer service and a pleasant stay, both of which we did not recieve. The next day we had to wait extra hours for a mechanic that was called out by us, NOT the hotel (as they did not believe it was their fault.) During these extra hours, trying to get a hold of room service was also a difficult process. The phone was answered after ringing them three times, only to find that the menu in our room was for monday not for sunday. So we were told the menu on the phone - very professional! Only on the mechanic stating that the hotel was at fault for the car fiasco where we given a quick apology, and a free upgrade when we book and PAY for a room next time we stay. My partner and I were expecting to have a luxurious relaxing getaway this weekend, which turned out to be a total disaster due to the rude customer service from the manager of the hotel, the delayed room service (may i add it took over an hour for room service to deliver 2 bottles of water) and half a full body massage at full price. But on a positive note.. the room was beautiful.. if thats all you look for when booking a room at radisson."
16,1091,Sep 14 2009 	Wonderful hotel	Stayed there on a long weekend. The best hotel I have ever stayed in. Rooms are beautiful. Bathrooms are outstanding. Staff are excellent. Great location. Would definitely stay there again.
17,1091,"Sep 10 2009 	perfect stay	stayed for two nights at this Hotel, from check in to check out every part of my stay was perfection. The room was large and exceptionally clean. Breakfast was delicious the best ive ever had and staff were always courteous and professional. Would definately stay again when next in London."
18,1091,"Sep 8 2009 	beautiful	stayed in this hotel in june and i can honestly say its by far the nicest hotel iv stayed in. we were greeted at the door and welcomed to the hotel. on the first nite of our stay we were going to a concert at the o2. we went to the front dest and asked if someone could phone us a cab, expecting a black taxi to come and pick us up, little did we know that we had our own private driver to escort us to the o2, and pick us up again. i felt like royalty.the rooms are very modern, the bathrooms are gorgeous, and the staff really go out of their way for you, will always come back here."
19,1091,"Sep 7 2009 	Great for a week-end break	We have just returned from a weekend in London. After checking Trip Advisor, we decided upon this hotel and I'm glad we did.The rates offered at weekends are very good and our first impression as we walked into the lobby was positive. The contemporary, clean decor was continued in our room. There was, in my opinion, a real attention to detail and the bathroom was fab. We were in a 'basic' room and I was extremely impressed. I'd definitely pay for the upgrade if I stayed here again!On the Friday evening we decided to eat in the restaurant, as it was getting late. There was a great atmosphere, the food was good and so was the service.Greenwich Park is a mile and a half from the hotel - we ran there on Saturday morning - but it would make a great outing. There are plenty of shops and cafes. The view of London is fabulous. Blackwall DLR is a five minute (maximum) walk - I was a little concerned when I read about scary walks back to the hotel in a review. However, we never felt there was a problem. On the Saturday night we walked back from Blackwall at gone eleven pm. It was well lit and felt safe to us.In my opinion, this is a lovely hotel with high standards. I would recommend it to friends without hesitation."
20,1091,"Sep 3 2009 	Superb Hotel in a Great Location	We spent 3 nights at this hotel and have to say value for money it was the best hotel we had stayed in whilst in London. We enjoyed a superior room with a view of the Dome. The room was spacious, and very modern. All areas of the hotel were spotless, the staff were extremely polite and helpful. Location was superb, 10 minutes walk to a tube station or into Canary Wharf itself. I can't praise it enough."
21,1091,"Aug 27 2009 	Don't be Tempted by Low Rates	Stayed here on a four-day sight-seeing trip. Hotel looked nice, and offered cheap rates, so went ahead and booked. Location though is terrible. You think you're by Canary Wharf, but in fact, you're a good 20 minute walk away from Canary Wharf/Jubilee Line/shops/restaurants. Nothing really around the hotel. With cab and Tube fares, and scary walks from Canary Wharf to hotel, you're better off staying closer to the city. Other problem was service. Every time I had an interaction with staff, left very unimpressed. What really steamed me was that I needed a cab to the airport early morning. Called concierge for help, since there was five of us. Told me only alternative was a 90 quid ride in a black cab. Asked if there was a cheaper alternative, he said no. While out, picked up a free flyer, called a cab company that had an advert. They picked me up in a van, friendly driver, 55 quid. Really, isn't that what a concierge is for? Just felt like the bloke had no clue, either that or had no desire to help. Bad enough to be staying in the middle of nowhere, don't need to compound with bad service."
22,1091,"Aug 27 2009 	One of the best hotels in London	The bedrooms allocated were &quot;absolutely beautiful&quot; the bathrooms elegant with great views of the O2 and surrounding area. The service at check in and checkout was very fast and efficient, Valet parking, so we didn't have to worry about parking the car.Bar - very quick and friendly service. Cleanliness of the rooms was outstanding. Breakfast was brilliant! The fact that breakfast is served until 11.30am at the weekend meant that we didn't feel rushed, a great end to a perfect stay. We had booked three bedrooms on a corporate stay with clients. I would recommend this hotel when wanting to impress your very best clients without a doubt!The New providence is most definitely one of the best hotels in London."
23,1091,Aug 26 2009 	Great Hotel	Great hotel in Docklands. Easy access to DLR and London City Airport. Rooms very new and comfortable. Free wireless internet access. I got a rate of 80 GBP per night from Radisson website which was outstanding value. Highly recommend
24,1091,"Aug 24 2009	Super views - super hotel	I enjoyed a weekend stay at this wonderful hotel. I booked a junior suite which had fantastic views from the floor to ceiling curved windows and a bathroom straight out of a fashionable magazine, complete with walk-in shower, luxury bath and twin washbasins.The hotel is tucked away at Providence Wharf but lies close to a DLR Station.The O2 building lies on the other side of the river - photos attached.Staff were very friendly, the bar was great with a super choice of cocktails. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty!Stay here for the super rooms!"
25,1091,"Aug 24 2009 	Stylish and comfortable stay	Service on checking in and in the bar was excellent, breakfast was a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so not a problem. The room was very comfortable, apart from the sofa which was a bit &quot;upright&quot;, and the laminate flooring just gave it a slightly less luxurious feel although appreciate that it's practical. Unfortunately the TV in the bathroom didn't work and the aircon was a bit on the noisy side. The location is nice and quiet and good views/impressive surroundings, i found it convenient and relaxing although some might prefer to be closer to the hubbub of the west end. I love the decor in the rooms and other areas of the hotel, but all the bathrooms/mirrors are just a little on the dark side, which is in keeping with the decor and more flattering!"
26,1091,"Aug 23 2009 	Great modern hotel	Hotel itself very impressive. Having booked this hotel because of the views across the river we were disappointed to be given a room overlooking the car park. Also when checking in, the couple next to us were given a free upgrade because it was their anniversary but even though we had already told the guy who was checking us in that it was our anniversary, we were not offered any upgrade, which was disappointing. However, the room itself WAS lovely, very comfortable big bed, flat screen TV, Wifi access, all mod cons and the bathroom was fantastic, very modern and stylish.. The spa facilities were fab, a great place for a relaxing break, although this hotel does NOT have a pool as stated on some websites. The shuttle boat across to the O2 was a nice bonus, loads of bars and restaurants over there to choose from. If booking, try and stress if you want a river view or you may be disappointed. On the whole a pleasurable stay and I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the O2."
27,1091,"Aug 23 2009 	great hotel	just back from a one night saty at this lovely hotel. it is not the easiset to find form the Dockland Light Railway station but well worth the effort. i loved everythign about the hotel itself. the check ion was efficiently done by a friendly memebr of staff. the room was amazing with a bathroom larger than some rooms i have stayed in. the view over the river thames was the best i ahve ever had in london.the spa is well worth a visit if you ahve time , a real place to relax with its steam room, sauna six different types of shower and warm loungers. breakfast was pricey but considering the excellant room rate i got it was worth the convenience of eating there.not convenient if you are wanting a night out in the centre of london but if you want ti visit london and have a relaxing base then this haven of affordable luxury is for you."
28,1091,"Aug 12 2009 	Luxury in the Docklands	What a fantastic stay, right in the middle of the docklands. Rooms are great and if you are lucky enough to be on the front, great views up and down the river and directly opposite the O2 Arena. Service ecellent and staff could not do enough for you."
29,1091,Aug 11 2009 	Sleek modern hotel in docklands	We booked the hotel at the last minute and got a great price for the room. The hotel is a 5 mins walk from Blackwall DLR. There was no queue at reception and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very modern and the beds were huge. The bathroom was also very nice with a great shower.There is not a lot in the immediate area of the hotel but as the DLR is so close it is easy to get back in to central london or Greenwich
30,1091,"Aug 10 2009 	Good Value	This hotel is a long walk from Canary Wharf use Blackwall (DLR), no shuttle bus at weekends. Lovely room, very clean, pity about the lukewarm bathwater. Liked the mineral water in reception - nice touch.Fridge unusable for own stuff."
31,1091,"Aug 3 2009 	Outstanding Canary Wharf Hotel	Having stayed at several Canary Wharf hotels I can honestly say the facilities and standard of this hotel are second to none, The location is excellent at the waterfront and with a shuttle service up to the banks its the perfect stay for business travellers and also a great location for the O2 opposite."
32,1091,"Jul 30 2009 	Very good value for money and friendly 4 star hotel!	My Fiancee and I originally chose this hotel as we were going to the Michael Jackson concert at the O2 Arena, so we chose it purely for location. Obviously as this gig was cancelled, we had to make other arrangements and got tickets for Dirty Dancing at the Aldwych Theatre instead. So that was the reason for our visit.I've got to say it's one of the poshest yet friendliest and comfortable 4 star hotels we have stayed at. We were allowed an early check in at our request with no extra charge and were greeted with a warm friendly welcome. When we needed to get a taxi the concierge actually opened the cab doors for us. I've not experienced this at many 4 star venues. The room was classed as a superior room but I believe it was just standard but what a room! A MASSIVE king size double bed which was very comfortable, all the mod cons you expect such as a flat screen tele, telephone, tea &amp; coffee facilities, ironing board, radio and mini bar. But this room also had a docking station for Ipods (even shuffles) and a computer for internet access. It also had temperature controls with air conditioning, great if you're always boiling hot in hotels like me! The bathroom is probably the best designed I have seen during my hotel stays. You have to check out the website pics to see what I mean. We just felt comfortable during our stay. Although we didn't spend a massive amount of time in the hotel apart from sleeping, the short time we spent there was great. We didn't get to use the leisure facilities though did manage a drink in the elegantly designed bar which had comfortable lighting and an lcd tele with big screen sport on. The restaurant was candlelit which I liked, though we didn't eat there. For only 78 (room only) through Late Rooms it was certainly very good value for money! We even shared a breakfast for 17 on room service which consisted of a full English fry up, toast, orange juice, tea or coffee, yoghurt, croissants and cereal.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. The only downside is that it's not really near Canary Wharf tube station. I would estimate a 15-20 minute walk and that's if you know how to get there. A taxi from outside the tube station cost us 6 to the hotel. That aside, it's one of the best hotels we've stayed at. Top stuff."
33,1091,"Jul 30 2009 	Absolutely Brilliant	Very impressed with all aspects of the hotel, so modern and contemporary, rooms well equiped with quality fixtures and fittings, thoughout, great detail had been given to the interior design including the the Bang &amp; Olufsen TV, the bathroom was amazing, free standing bath with fantastic views of the Thames and 02 Arena. Without a doubt, the best hotel we have ever stayed in, would definately use this again and highly recommend to friends and family. Was a bit cautious of the nouveau menu but when the food arrived, it was cooked to perfection and the presentation was amazing, we didnt want to leave, wish we had more time to take the opportunity of using the spa facilities, maybe next time."
34,1091,"Jul 29 2009 	Sleek clean new hotel.	The hotel was well fitted out with what looked like a high quality finish. Our room was clean and had a lovely rain shower and separate bath which i liked!Staff were fine and answered the couple of questions we had but did not go out of their way to be overly helpful or friendly - eg. at one point we were directed to use the internet as opposed to our question being answered by the staff member. I didn't mind this but it made me feel a bit like we'd been a nuisance!We arrived the first night at about 10.45pm and asked if the restaurant was still serving food. We were told that it served to 11pm so we went straight into the restaurant and they told us the kitchen had switched off the ovens so we could only get bar snacks. I think for a hotel of this size they could serve food in the restaurant until the time they state at reception?... We had 2 pizzas from the bar menu - these were fine and they boxed up for us what we didn't eat without us asking, which was nice. Breakfast was good, seemed like quality stuff, ie. not cheap sausage or bacon! My only little moan was that i was served horrible tea on the second morning, whereas the previous morning i was given a pot. These are not things i'd mention apart from the hotel isn't a cheap one and markets itself as higher end and little things (like nice tea) need to be maintained!We had excellent service from one waiter at breakfast which started off the day well and was appreciated!We got the tube from Victoria to the hotel. The last section is on the DLR. Our booking info recommended we get off at East India stop, however we found Blackwell/Blackwall (or something like that!) was much closer to the hotel. We were quoted 25 in a taxi so were glad we got the train.We had a very good stay and i'd recommend this hotel to others."
35,1091,"Jul 28 2009 	Modern and comfortable!	We stayed one night in this hotel, which was a little hard to find, but we asked a couple people and eventually figured out the nearest tube. Check in we had a problem with one key, but then just used the other one. Room is very modern. Not sure how I felt about the male butt on the wall as art, but everything else was very clean, modern and enjoyable. The bathroom had glass walls and shower and plenty of room to store clothes if needed. There are a couple restaurants near by as well as a McDonalds."
36,1091,"Jul 28 2009 	Very nice staff enhance a sleek hotel	I stayed here from 24 - 27 July 2009 for a business / leisure weekend. Via a well known breaks site I got a very good rate. My room was a standard double with a side view to the other new buildings in this pretty-well all-new area. I had asked for a higher level room with a river view (on the site's booking form request field) but didn't get that: however at the price I was not about to complain.I quickly settled into the room and liked it. The bed was a normal double size, good quality, topped with velvet cushions and throw. The angled window had a seat and coffee table, screened off by an organza drape. Big wallmounted TV, good desk and excellent lighting throughout. The fast, free, simple wifi was perfect. One wall socket was broken. Tea / coffee supplied but nothing fancy and no biscuits. Mini bar was fine. The bathroom (room 218) was adapted for disabled guests' use so was very spacious - which I liked, needless to say. The bathrooms are wet-room style. Gilchrist &amp; Soames wall-mounted toiletries were ok but a bit scentless. The shaver point was broken but concierge services had an adaptor with me in 5 minutes.The overall feel of the room was modern, executive and calm. It was certainly quiet and the aircon kept things cool. The window opened. Room service was quick and a delicious smoked salmon bagel sandwich with some chunky chips was about 9 and was with me within 15 mins the twice I ordered it.Just about every member of staff was friendly and smiled a 'hello'. The bowler-hatted concierges met me at the taxi in executive style and were helpful with directions. The check-in reception chap was very friendly and informative (although while we were doing my check in a more senior member appeared round the corner and put down a paper in front of him, ordering him to &quot;do it right next time!&quot; which was rude in from of a guest!).A colleague and I ate in the restaurant and the food was fairly-priced and good throughout with delightful service. A tasty rib-eye type steak with sides was about 13. Scotch whisky was 6 a go for Famous Grouse which was the cheapest - priced the same as more expensive brands, oddly. But bar service too was all good.Breakfast offers various options and is 17 for the full selection. There are a couple of options at a surcharge like Scottish kippers. The buffet selection was fine, both hot and cold (good fresh fruit). Porridge (no supplement) was brought fresh to the table. (If you want to go cheap, there's a Macdonalds about 5 minutes' walk away.)There is a spa (and pool at 5 a day pass) at the hotel - which we didn't try. However the range of treatments was comprehensive and not over-priced.Blackwell Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is 10 minutes' walk away and from there you can link up to the underground (Tower Hill is a good change point) into town. The hotel has seating outside, amongst attractive planting, and a terrace area overlooking the river and O2. So - a notably friendly hotel, executive in feel but not stuffy, in a quiet setting near the impressive towers of Docklands. The downside is that you have to travel a bit to get into town. Your call - but it was a positive trade-off for this visitor!"
37,1091,"Jul 27 2009 	Modern Oasis by the river	Myself and my girlfriend stayed here on the 18th July. We arrived at 12 midday and our room was ready for us. Valet parking costs 12.50 which, is very reasonable for london. I upgraded to a one bedroom suite for 40 and it was well worth it. We didnt have a river view that we would have liked but the room made up for that. Large living room with dinning area - medium to large size bedroom and fantastic bathroom. All 3 rooms had tvs and stereos.The service was excellent, apart from an extra dressing gown that we asked for that never turned up..but that's just being picky. Drinks are expensive, but only in comparison to bars and clubs. They are what you would expect from a 4-5 star hotel.We went into London for the day, cocktails and lunch, followed by dinner at a brazilian restaurant that my girlfriend was dying to try in the o2 village. I had been trying to propose all day but every time it felt like the right time something would happen and ruin the moment. Eventually we sat on a gorgeous terrace at the hotel overlooking the river and the brightly lit o2 directly opposite and i popped the question(she said yes). I would like to thank the hotel for helping me to make it a special day, we are now planning our wedding and will be back on the same date each year to celebrate. Thank you radisson!"
38,1091,"Jul 23 2009 	great hotel.	great hotel, great staff. The only fault i can find is having someone shouting &quot;action&quot; outside my room door at 07:30 in the morning, this was a film crew, which i hadnt been warned about, other than that breakfast was good and the hotel is near the docklands light rail."
39,1091,"Jul 22 2009 	Horrible experienceWould not stay there again at any price.	Room was booked via hotels.com so the day before are stay i telephoned the hotel to check the reservation was in order as i have stayed in radisson hotels before and checking in is not there strong point,After being passed to 4 different people at the hotel was told sorry we do not have a reservation for you,I told them i have a booking reference number from hotels.com but they were not interested,Had to spend 2 hours sorting out with hotels.com and found out it was the radissons fault spent the next morning on the phone to the hotel trying to find out if they were going to give me a room or not which delayed are trip by half a day,I sent an email to the manager of the hotel to complain and im still waiting for a reply,Very poor.I would say the hotel is typical 4* nothing special rooms are very small there are no little bottles of shampoo etc just a big bottle of shower/shampoo screwed to the wall only 2 towels in the bathroom,Poor lighting, tv to complicated to operate,The bed was very uncomfotable worse than a travelodge bed only 2 pillows,Noisy air conditioning,Only about 20% of the rooms have a river view all the rest either look into peoples flats or at a main road/motorway,Very poor location i would not walk around the area surrounding the hotel after dark.Staff at the hotel are all very snotty,I would not stay at this hotel again if they paid me too."
40,1091,"Jul 20 2009 	Amazing Hotel - Couldn't be faulted	From the moment we stepped foot in the hotel, we were made to feel welcome. The receptionist who checked us in remembered my voice from a telephone call I made earlier to her in the week, without any hints at all. The rooms were absolutely spotless. The walk in shower/wet room was amazing and even was able to use the supplied ipod docking station (should have left mine at home!). Car parking was fantastic for 12.50 and had a great view of the o2. DLR nearby was really helpful and was only a short journey by cab later that night. Would def recommend to anybody."
41,1091,"Jul 20 2009 	Excellent Location and Excellent Hotel	We stayed here recently and cannot say enough about the hotel. The staff were extremely professional and friendly giving advice what to go and see. We stayed in a superior room and were not dissappointed. It was excellent and very spacious.The location was great for the O2, just over the thames. The train station was very close, approx 5 mins walk and canary wharf a couple of stops on the train or about 10 mins walk. Hoping to stay there again in January."
42,1091,Jul 14 2009 	Great hotel	Very nice hotel. Everything was new and very clean. The bathroom was great. The staff at the hotel was very nice. And the food in the resturant was ecxelent!
43,1091,"Jul 8 2009 	Nice hotel............BUT.	At a glance the hotel does all the right things, neatly styled bedrooms, good bar area, ticks all the boxes for a casual or business stay.We stayed for a night to goto an event at the o2, which the hotel has a great view of if im honest, once in the hotel check in was reasonable as opposed to swift, bedrooms well appointed-Bang &amp; Olufsen tv etc, wet room stlye bathroom however we notice the toilet was broken, we notified reception who assured us whilst out for dinner they would fix it, we went to the bar for a drink prior to our meal, we got given a cocktail menu ( quite good but pricey), after 25 mins nobody came to take an our order, we left as we had reservations without having a drink!! We returned to the hotel after 10pm to find the toilet had a new button it, it still didn't flush however, we phoned reception again who said they would get back to us (20 mins passed),we phoned again and were told they couldn't move us as they were fully booked, we told them it was unacceptable and we'd be checking out unless something was sorted, oddly enough tens mins later we get a phone call saying they had a room, we finally got into the room a little after 11, which took the shine off our day.On the day of checkout whilst my wife was in the shower I decided to put the light on in the bedroom, the lightbulb shattered and blew the fuse for the room, leaving my wife in the dark,in the shower, we informed reception who sent the maintenance man up (with a screw driver) who looked at it and asked if we were checking out,which we said we were, he then left us and said he'd fix it once we were out the room, we checked out and made our thoughts to the duty manager at the time about our experience, he said he'd email me back a response which to date none has come (we stayed on the 18/06), we have bizarrely had an automated response from Raddison regarding feedback, in addition I also emailed the hotel direct to chase up our complaint and have not even got response from that.Overall, I was dissappointed with the service, the hotel itself was ok, I just hope that anyone who does stay doesn't have any exploding lightbulbs or toilet issues.....In todays market you would of thought service was parramount, clearly not."
44,1091,"Jul 6 2009 	Very enjoyable	Welcoming hotel and staff (much appreciated after a long journey). Nice room, excellant disabled facilities in spacious bathroom. Good meal enjoyed in restaurant with great view of The O2 Arena."
45,1091,"Jul 6 2009 	Why stay anywhere else in the Wharf???	The Radisson NPW is a fantastic hotel - the service is excellent, the facilities are excellent and all within easy reach of transport links and the O2. Having organised events at this hotel and hearing the fantastic reviews from my company's travellers, I just had to experience it myself. The restaurant food is not the standard hotel food, it is by far top quality food with top quality service. The spa is excellent and offers relaxing treatments. The rooms are minimalistic, stylish and have all the latest mod-cons. So, whether you stay for business or pleasure, I would highly recommend this hotel."
46,1091,"Jul 2 2009 	Overnight Stay	Hotel was clean, staff were attentive. Wife ate in restaurant, said the food was very good. Would stay again."
47,1091,Jul 2 2009 	A true bit of luxury	A very modern and relaxing hotel with great views over the Thames and the O2 arena.The staff on the bar were very attentive making sure we never had an empty glass.The level of service from the rest of the staff was second to none who would go that extra mile for you.I will be recommending the hotel to my family and friends without a doubt.
48,1091,"Jun 30 2009 	My new London apartment!	My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to find a late booking deal through a well known site offering mystery hotels at the last minute, as it were. We paid a bargain rate for a 2 night stay 25/26 June while we took in a show, some food and some typical tourist attractions around central London.Getting around London is easy enough, if you're young and virile a ten-minute walk to Canary Wharf tube on the Jubilee line gives great access, or 5 minutes to Blackwall DLR and get a transfer. - The concierge was delighted to help with directions and everything else we could ask for during our stay, unlike other high-end hotel groups which have a knack for hiring sullen front-of-house staff.I never bother writing reviews, but felt strongly enough about the experience we had at the RE:NPW to actually sit here and tell people.The rooms are clean, very well appointed with classy fittings and electronics and the views are special if you get the right room. The staff are delightful, from the cleaners we bumped into on the landing to the guard in the hut at the bottom of the street! - In a city as rushed and frequently unfriendly as London, this is a veritable haven of smiling, polite folks.We'll be back again, even if we can't get such a remarkable deal. - An absolute pleasure, thanks!"
49,1091,"Jun 27 2009 	Great place for the O2	Stayed here for a night out at the O2. Good hotel, nice room and helpful staff. Nearly travelled up on the train but with valet parking at 12.50 for 24 hours was cheaper than parking at our local station.On the night we stayed the Jubilee line was out of action so took advantage of a free ferry from right outside the hotel - couldn't have been easier.On the negatvie side, there's not much else in the area but the bars and shops at Canary Wharf are only 10mins walk away and there are plenty of options at the O2. Will definately stay again the next time we come up to the O2 for an event."
50,1091,"Jun 26 2009 	Thank You for a Lovely Stay	Stayed in this Hotel for a Concert in O2 Arena, we were only 5 minutes by taxi. The Hotel was fabulous, definately 4*. Staff were fantastic, nothing was a problem. We were a little bit out from the centre of London but it only took 10 minutes to get to the underground. There is a lovely spa at the Hotel which I took to liberty of trying and felt totally refreshed after it. I have already recommended this hotel to my family and friends and when in London again I will definately be booking the Radisson Edwardian New Providence Wharf."
51,1091,Jun 23 2009 	Good Modern Hotel	My husband and I got a really good deal for 1 night staying at this hotel as we were attending a concert at the O2 arena. The rooms are a good size with a modern feel and the bathroom is well laid out with a separate bath and showerThe hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to the DLR station which made getting to the O2 nice an easy.
52,1091,Jun 23 2009 	The place to be for West End Girls...........	I chose this hotel for its proximity to the O2 arena as I was going to see the Pet Shop Boys.Fantastic view of the O2 arena from my full length bedroom windowBathroom was divine with massive walk in shower and a seperate HUGE bath tub.Bed was super comfortable and quite an unusual style (Leather)Nice B&amp;O LCD TVAll in all an excellent stay and would throughly recommend
53,1091,"Jun 22 2009 	Great hotel but ...	Great hotel, good location (although the DLR station might be a bit of a trek for the elderly/infirm). Good size rooms, with excellent decor and high quality fixtures and fittings, and aircon. Good selection of beers and food at the bar (rather expensive though).Really cant fault the hotel at all, but the practise of including a service charge at every purchase from the bar no matter how big or small (and it seems to be a completely random amount) is at best cheeky and worst downright fraudulent. I have no problem with leaving a tip for waiting on staff when I leave the bar and the staff were all excellent, but the practise of having the staff deciding what tip they want when they serve you is just bizarre. %25 service charge for one bottle of lager ? Its a great hotel, but I woudn't stay there again, as there is are huge amount of hotels to stay in London, and not all of them rip you off..."
54,1091,"Jun 19 2009 	Great deal great room great hotel	We booked a suite for a staggering 164 (ex tax and breakfast) and had a room on the sixth floor. We didn't get a view of the Thames like other rooms, and instead could be nosey into the swanky apartments adjacent, and we did have a tantalising view of the Canary Wharf towers.We travelled to the hotel by DLR from Bank which is effortless, even with a five minute walk once you get off at Blackwall - don't in any way be put off by the fact that it looks like a long way from Canary Wharf. In fact, in the morning there's a free shuttle bus over to CW which cuts out a single change on the DLR at Poplar (and even that isn't inconvenient).The room was what I'd describe as Scandinavian minimalist - don't expect large pictures on the walls, but equally don't think I mean very clinical, cold furnishings. It had a functional yet relaxed feel and the suite itself was pretty spacious. As well as the standard Radisson B&amp;O TVs, there were two iPod-enabled music devices (Bose Soundwave and a alarm clock with iPod dock) - small features, but worthy ones for travellers who don't lug CDs around with them wherever they go. All rooms feature complimentary WiFi - some other chains aren't so generous - and my wife enjoyed a pedicure in the spa. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but did pop into the bar which was cool (but pricey).The service was good, the room service breakfast was great and overall we had a fantastic time here. I'm a closet fan of Radisson hotels but would chose this chain - and this hotel - over a nearby Hilton or Marriott any day.Quick note - we were staying here because we were going to a concert at the O2, which is literally just over the water from the hotel. However, it is still quite tricky to get to if using public transport. You will either need to take a cab (c. 12) or take the DLR to Poplar to change for Canary Wharf to pick up the Jubilee Line to the O2."
55,1091,"Jun 19 2009 	Very Good Hotel	Excellent helpful service, good position, very clean but is very new, overall a comfortable stay. Would be very happy to stay again when in London."
56,1091,"Jun 18 2009 	Simply The Best	An outstanding hotel with breathtaking views over the Thames, Rooms are fantastic, in particular the spacious bathroom, and the staff there are second to none Fabulous buffet Breakfast also"
57,1091,"Jun 14 2009 	Outsanding rooms at affordable prices	I stayed at this hotel on the 10 June. The room rate is excellent and the quality of room available is outstanding. The hotel is a short walk (10 mins) from Canary Wharf but also served by DLR and free shuttle. Given it is on the edge of Canary Wharf the size of room is tremendous and the location on the river means many rooms have River Views - the room I had was enormous with 4 windows looking on the River. The hotel is very clean, excellent reception staff who can't do enough for you. The bathroom facilites were again excellent with a large free standing bath (by the window). I will be going back, regularly."
58,1091,"Jun 14 2009 	Peaceful hotel great to stay at for The O2.	I stayed here with my husband and 6 friends on Saturday 6th June as we were attending a concert at the O2, we arrived half an hour early for check-in but this was not a problem and were immediately given our room keys....we had parked up just outside the hotel and so handed over our car keys for the valet parking, this was completed efficiently and when we requested our car back in the morning - we didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes. We asked if we could have rooms next to each other but the receptionist said the hotel was full up so could not arrange this...although the hotel never seemed to have many people around. We then went up to our rooms and were pleased with what we saw, the room was spacious with modern decoration...the bathroom was extremely clean and had a lovely deep tub and walk in shower, the bed was comfortable and when we finally went to bed for the night - the curtains kept the light out of the room completely. The bar was very nice, pricey but then it would be the same at any hotel bar....it was relaxing and not over-crowded. We never ate in the restaurant at the hotel so I can't comment on it but we had a quick peek at the breakfast in the morning and it looked very appetising. We received a courtesy call from reception asking if there was anything we needed and not to hesitate to contact them if we did. We got cabs straight outside the hotel over to The O2 as the jubilee line was not running, this was 15 for 4 people which we thought was reasonable....reading the response from the last message where they will be laying on a ferry service over to the O2 would have been extremely helpful but at least we know for next time...as I'm sure we will return to this hotel. In the morning we went for a swim in the small pool across the road from the hotel - it also has a sauna and steam room, apparently there is supposed to be a charge for this but we just said we were from the hotel and they let us in for free...it has floor to ceiling windows and had a great view of The O2. We then went back up to our rooms got ready and checked out which was a quick and easy process.The hotel was really very nice and I would definitely plan to stay here again - the only downside was the jubilee line not running but obviously that is not the hotel's fault and as they have begun the ferry service this will no longer be an issue...We all had a pleasant stay and were happy with the hotel."
59,1091,"Jun 13 2009 	Perfect....nothing is too much trouble!	One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The staff are so polite and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them, excellent location for the 02, and anything else was easy to get to. Rooms were excellent, with everyting you need whilst your away from home. Would definietly go back again......felt like I was royalty when I was there :)"
60,1091,"Jun 9 2009 	Lovely Hotel - Shame its in Canary Wharf!	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights - we were going to see a concert in 02 the first night and sight seeing the next day and evening.Unfortunetly there were planned closures on the DLR and the Jubilee line when we arrived we got lost getting to the hotel so ended up getting a taxi (this was no fault of the hotel but be check to see if the lines are running if you are staying during a weekend as they are doing major improvements for the 2012 Olympics). Check in was fast and efficient, with a my credit card number taken in advance for any room service or spa treatments. We were booked into a superior room on the 5th floor. The room was lovely, very modern with a large bathroom, unfortunetly my request for a room overlooking the O2 had been ignored (even the hotel appeared to be very quiet) but this did not matter as I we enjoyed our view over Canary Wharf, The night of the concert we got a taxi back to the hotel from Canary Wharf - it was about 9 and this with a black cab - quite reasonable.During our stay we didnt use the East India DLR but walked up to Canary Wharf tube as we found this line more convienient (about a 15-20min walk) and very safe although you have to cross a couple of busy roads,We used Blackwall once and it was fine - I did not find this area intimidating at all.Check out was again fast and professional - I was told the 100 they had taken from my account for room service charges would be refunded (slight grumble that they didnt mention they had taken 100 out of my account when we checked in!).Conclusion is that this hotel is great for the 02 or Canary Wharf but if your looking to be in and out of the city I would stay somewhere closer. The novelty of Canary Wharf wears off after 5mins - all the shops, restaurants etc are all chain stores and you feel like you could be anywhere. I prefer somewhere with a bit of history and culture. On a side note I notice the manager of the hotel reads these posts - in the welcome book in the rooms it would be useful to include some maps, transport links etc of the wider area - particulary with the planned tube closures this summer and the amount of guests staying in the hotel on a weekend for 02 concerts."
61,1091,"Jun 8 2009 	A great and unique experience every single time I stayed there!!!	Unusual big rooms for London's hotel with great bathrooms, great staff, great food.Staff very friendly even when I was stressed they had the patience to calm me down..."
62,1091,"Jun 4 2009 	Would be perfect if it were close to anything except Canary Wharf	Excellent service and accomodation. Restaurant fair; drinks overpriced. Says it's &quot;close&quot; to Canary Wharf DLR &quot;10 minute walk&quot; but they lied. more like twenty minutes at a brisk pace. Actually a 10 minute walk to Blackwall station. Walk to Canary Wharf is along very busy highway and was scary. Great views of Thames, especially at dusk. Would have been perfect if more convenient to usual Londo tourist destinations. Nowhere decent to eat except hotel without significant travel."
63,1091,Jun 1 2009 	Fantastic friendly quiet and perfect for the O2	When we first pulled upto the hotel we knew it would be good. Staff are fantastic and very friendly. They simply can't do enough for you. They don't hassle you but you know they are around. The hotel itself was quiet. Well it was when we stayed. The rooms are a good size and not overly priced. We stayed for the Beyonce concert at the O2 and found it a perfect location. Just a short taxi trip away and that cost about 15.00. We are waiting for the next concert so that we can book another room!!!
64,1091,"May 30 2009 	AVOID regularly overbook sent to another hotel 1HR away way out of town	avoid this hotel at all costs. after driving for 4 hours the shift manager told us they had double booked so they sent us to another hotel 1 hour away in london traffic with most of the roads closed off due to building works. thearea resembles a building site not close to the tube network or city centre in an area that doesn't look very safe . next day the daytime shift manager Emile insisted that we return to the edwardian radisson or pay more to stop where we had been put by the evening manager, even though he had assured us we could stay put for the rest of our 3 day visit at no extra cost. staff at the replacement hotel told us the radisson regularly overbook and send irrate guests to them. so book this hotel at your peril. THE REAL LIFE FAULTY TOWERS. WE HAD BOOKED THIS HOTEL FOR MY HUSBAND'S 50TH BIRTHDAY WHICH WAS RUINED"
65,1091,"May 28 2009 	Stunning Hotel but avoid the restaurant	We stayed on a Friday night and the hotel really was fantastic. A modern and stlyish building with a light and airy feel. The rooms were beautiful with a really great bathroom.We loved everything about this hotel apart from the restaurant. We ordered a steak and a burger with a glass of wine each. After 50 minutes we questioned why the food hadn't arrived. They apologised and 10 minutes later our meals came. The restaurant wasn't busy and no explanation was given for the delay. When the bill came they charged us 9 a glass for a (very average) rose wine and added a 12.5% service charge. Poor service, disappointing food and rip off prices. I hate do dwell on the negatives but this really spoiled what would have been a great stay at this hotel"
66,1091,"May 27 2009 	good hotel - would like to go back for weekend break	A good hotel for a good price. Nice and clean and spacious. Deluxe room had a huge bathroom, but no bath! A walk in shower insted which suited me fine but may not suit everyone. Room was lovely - would definately stay again - especially for 100 a night advance booking, given the cost of other 4*plus in the area.Not sure there description of a 10 minute walk to Canary Wharf is correct (centre of it anyway) - unless you walk fast :-) but there is a hotel shuttle bus to take you there in the morning and return at night - last one around 9pm though. 5 in a taxi if you need one."
67,1091,"May 22 2009 	Fabulous Hotel	We had stayed at the hotel to go to an exhibition in the area. From the point of arrival, the staff had been wonderful and attentive. Stayed in a beautiful room with a wonderful view, though slightly angled. One of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. Breakast too was good with a variety of dishes available. Would definitely stay there again and have already recommended the hotel to family and friends."
68,1091,"May 22 2009 	A modern hotel with traditional values of personal service	I have stayed at a number of hotels around this location and based on star rating alone you are spoilt for choice. The Radisson, however, to me sets itself clearly above the rest by ensuring guests feel &quot;at home&quot;. The hotel is clean, and provides luxury for very good value - the bar and restaurant provide a friendly atmosphere whether staying on business or with your family (I have done both). Any minor complaints I have had were quickly given hotel management attention - overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. This is a hotel providing traditional high quality service levels in an age when good personal service is often rare - well done !"
69,1091,"May 14 2009 	Taking Customer Service to Another Level	From the moment we arrived for the weekend we were treated both warmly and respectfully - not a combination many hotels manage. The staff in all areas of the hotel did their absolute best to accommodate our every need without ever making it seem anything other than normal to do so. For me, with very specific dietary requirements, this is essential but so often lacking in other places I have visited. The entire weekend was spent relaxing, from the fabulous Spa treatments - where you are cosseted and cared for, to relaxing in the bar, nothing spoilt the calm, tranquil atmosphere so by the end of the weekend I was the most relaxed I'd been in a very long time! An important factor for this is the design and location of the hotel, for the first time I was able to sleep and was not kept awake by other guests or traffic - a real bonus as I never expect a good night's sleep in a hotel. Specific details: the rooms are so clean you would think they are new, they have many home from home features like soft robes, 'My Music' (allowing you to use your iPod in the room) and staff who will help you with anything you need. The hotel is quiet, bright and modern without being austere. Food from the bar and restaurant is modern in nature, of a high standard and as you would expect, beautifully presented and served by staff who can't do enough for you. If you enjoy a good breakfast, I would say their selection will impress you. You can have everything from a 'Full English' to Fruit Salad. It is all laid out for you to choose from and is even categorised into 'Low' and 'High' Calorie so if you are being good you can still eat your fill with plenty of choice. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for both business and leisure and have already done so."
70,1091,"May 11 2009 	outstanding hotel service and staff. 5star room for 4star money	Book early and take advantage of discounts for doing so, the staff were refreshingly helpful and attentive to our needs (not just the usual lip service experienced elsewhere).Very pleasantly suprised with the room and ensuite facility but particularly and without asking for one a room with a view up the thames.Really great place to stay."
71,1091,May 10 2009 	Fantasic Wedding Party	We stayed in Radisson Edwardian NPW in December for our wedding party. The River Room where the venue was held with its amazing view over the Thames and the O2 Arena was the perfect location for our special occasion. Friendly and very helpful Staff made us and our guests feel really special. Thank you All for the fantastic wedding party!!!
72,1091,"May 8 2009 	Top quality	My stay here over two nights was a wonderful experience to say the very least. Checking in was easy and friendly with the kind offer of newspapers delivered to the room in the mornings which I accepted with thanks.The room was a wonder; huge bed, classy television and the adjoining bathroom was fantastic with its huge bath and even better shower.I ordered room service on the second night and was very plesed with the speed of service and all aspects of the meal. Just down the road is a very pleasant Italian restaurant which I enjoyed on my first night.Check-out was just as friendly and helpful as when we arrived. We needed a taxi arranging to take us to Canary Wharf station. This was done quickly and with a smile.This modern hotel is a great all-rounder and I'd reccomend it to everyone."
73,1091,"May 1 2009 	A real treat for us	We used the hotel for a special couple of days in London as I had already visited it in connection with my business. The welcome was superb; the rooms was described by my wife as OMIGOD - in the best possible way of course. We felt very good to be there and we will return. The air-conditioning was hard to control and we kept our windows open much of the time - overlooking the river and the O2 - but otherwise it was great - and superb value for such a high standard. The breakfasts were fine but the service was not top-level. We used Mini Cab UK for getting into the West End and South of the river - in a very comfortable (and reasonably-priced) Ford Galaxy - and they sent the same driver each time, which again made us feel special. Here's to the next time!"
74,1091,"Apr 29 2009 	Chic Birthday Getaway	We stayed in the Radisson Edwardian New Providence on 19th-21st April 2009 for my 24th birthday and an event at the O2, I paid extra for a deluxe room &amp; it was well worth it. The room was spacious &amp; modern, with really trendy furniture &amp; gorgeous bathroom. The Decor was really simple but gorgeous, there was so much space, even with a huge glass dask , modern chaiselong, 2 chairs and a big bed in the room. The bathroom is also very spacious and modern with separate bath and shower.The hotel is about a 15-20min walk to Canary Wharf tube station (not 10 like it says on the hotel website!), it was nice weather so this didn't matter. I would recommend printing off directions to find the hotel if you intend to walk as we got a bit lost when we arrived and first tried to find the hotel. However, once you know where you are going the walk is enjoyable &amp; there are plenty of bars/shops/restaurants in Canary Wharf to walk to. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but we had drinks in the hotel bar both nights, prices &amp; choice were very good, &amp; service was great! We had room service breakfast on our last morning as a treat, it seemed expensive but we ordered anyway as a last minute luxury. Tthere was so much food, neither of us made a dent on the amount given and the selection they provided was huge &amp; the breakfast was worth the money. Views from the hotel of the O2 arena are amazing, and this is probably the closest hotel to it. (Although it does take some time to get there- it took us about 15mins in a taxi on the way there for 20 &amp; 30mins via the tube/walking on the way back, as its only one stop away). Although not near much, the area is peaceful and the rest of London is very easily accessible with everything being a maximum of about 30-35minutes away. It took us 30minutes all together to get to St Pancras Station and less than that to reach Oxfrod Street, including the 15minute walk from the hotel to the Canary Wharf tube station.We couldn't fault the hotel; the staff did everything to make our stay enjoyable and were really nice, the room was gorgeous &amp; probably one of the nicest looking/well finished hotel rooms I have stayed in. We went for a relaxing/romantic/fun few days of escape and I would definitely recommend the hotel for a couples getaway! I will definitely stay in this hotel again!Note: We had a really, really enjoyable stay in this hotel which I think was also due to the gorgeous sunny weather, walking to the shops / bars / restaurants / tube in Canary Wharf every day for 15 minutes was enjoyable rather than a chore. However, I'm not sure if the is would have been the case if it had been raining, it would have been expensive and more hassle to get around if the weather wasn't so nice. The hotel was amazing, but I wanted to emphasise the fact that you do have to walk/taxi to get anywhere: I will still stay at this hotel again though!!"
75,1091,"Apr 28 2009 	Great hotel lovely food decent location nice shower and bed - what more do you want as a business traveller?!	As a regular business traveller (and a regular of this hotel), I want a number of things1. A hotel that is easy to get to. Ok, so not in the heart of Canary Wharf but a short walk and a shorter shuttle ride. DLR to City Airport/Bank also walking distance2. A hotel that servies decent room service. Room service food is always very good here - steaks done as asked, food hot, good selection. Don't like the undisclosed tray charge, but its a fairly standard charge in hotels. Its hard to find the right button to press on the phone and sometimes it just rings and rings but all in all is good2. A decent bed with decent temperature. Beds are fine, cleanliness is immpeccible, and recent room temperature issues seem to be getting sorted3. A decent shower - not one of those things that you need to stand in a bath and contort your body under to get the miniscule trickle of scalding water! This one has a proper shower with none of the attributes above.4. Quick check in and check outI would have the following quibbles- TV channels are not great, poor reception, not all are available- Room service can be slow- customer service can sometimes leave a little to be desired (e.g. lack of follow up on queries/complaints)- gym is a little pokey and while never used pool it looks small for a decent swimHowever, no hotel is perfect and on balance I would be more than happy to continue to use this hotel."
76,1091,"Apr 28 2009 	Excellent hotelstafffood 	This hotel is one of the best I have stayed and I have travelled around the world and have stopped at many hotels.I am in London on business every week and I have tried several hotel until I stayed at the Radisson, and because the hotel has such a wonderful atmosphere and staff I have stopped there ever since.Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the room are very spacious and I love the flat screens TV in the rooms and even in the bathroom in some room I have stayed in.Even the busy general manager Paul Duggan will find time to come and have a friendly chat.I always recommend this hotel to my colleague and friends."
77,1091,"Apr 25 2009 	Nice enough hotel but not as convenient as I had hoped for O2	My husband and I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the O2, but actually we needn't have bothered with worrying about this. Blackwall station on the DLR is the nearest station to the hotel, however once you emerge from the station it is a bit of a challenge to actually locate the hotel - a challenge made all the more daunting by the horrible neighbourhood (you are right next to Poplar, which is to be avoided!). After our arrival at the hotel I'd already decided that I didn't fancy coming back to Blackwall from the O2 after dark, so we agreed that we would take a taxi to the O2 (it then transpired that the Jubilee line, which services the O2, wasn't running anyway, so a taxi would have been our only option - other than a boat!!). So in summary ... if I were to be going to the O2 again, I would concentrate on finding a hotel in a nicer area and not worry quite so much about its proximity to the O2.As for the hotel itself ... it was nice enough. The reception staff were helpful and the room was adequate (although very very limited TV channels, and the naked female torso on the wall was a bit odd). The breakfast I would say was only adequate."
78,1091,"Apr 24 2009 	Not completely convinced...	First impressions were mixed - the reception area is very clean and attractive but the lady at the front desk gave me a rather cool reception. I then went up to my (supposedly &quot;deluxe&quot;) room to find that it overlooked the main road and a car park - lovely! I'd asked for a river view room and, whilst I appreciate that hotels can't always accomodate such requests, I really didn't get the impression that the hotel was full or even busy. The room itself was very nicely furnished and immaculately clean. The lighting arrangements seemed to be a bit complicated - I ended up just mashing the switches until a light came on somewhere. I was not happy with the level of traffic noise throughout the night (however, I should point out that I'm used to sleeping in a very quiet room).The bar area was very nice and a good place to relax, but the member of staff who served me didn't seem to be paying attention to what he was doing. The wine he served tasted as though it had been open a long time and stored in a warm place - not nice at all.When I checked out, I got a flavour of why this hotel has had such good reviews - the member of staff who checked me out and the doorman were so friendly and eager to help that I was left with more positive feelings for this hotel. If I stay in this area again I'll consider this hotel, but I'm not ready to recommend it yet."
79,1091,Apr 23 2009 	The hotel resold my PREPAID room 	I prepaid 100% of the room charge &amp; was dismayed to find they had oversold the hotel when I arrived there and did not have a room for me. Understand it took me 2 taxi's and a train to travel specially to this hotel which I needed to be at as it was close to the O2 Arena. I still don't understand how they can resell your room if you have paid for 100% of it. Granted they sent me in a taxi to the May Fair Hotel which is in central London but the whole point of me staying there in the first place was to be close to the O2 Arena. No attempt to contact me was made &amp; I find the whole experience incredibly slack!
80,1091,"Apr 23 2009 	Great Hotel hard to get to	As you would expect from the Radisson, the hotel facilities and staff were excellent. However, we choose the hotel as we were attending an event at the O2 (directly opposite the hotel across the Thames). Firstly, it is quite difficult to get to the hotel using public transport. Secondly, it is frustratingly difficult to get to the O2 considering it is just across the river. We ended up in a taxi which is a 30 round trip."
81,1091,"Apr 17 2009 	Lovely Place	One of the Best places I have ever stayed. Most of the rooms have an excellent view. Very helpful and good staff, how are eager to help people. Be sure to find the best rates though, I have stayed there 3 times and the rates have fluctuated majorly."
82,1091,"Apr 16 2009 	Enjoying the Docklands at the Providence Wharf Hotel	This was our second stay at The Radisson Edwardian New Providence Wharf, and we are very happy with it. Courteous and friendly staff, rooms with lovely design and beautiful river view, and also nice breakfasts. We - a pair ofd Norwegian academics - could not ask for more!"
83,1091,"Apr 15 2009 	Nice but not without severe drawbacks	Stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel is very new and nice. Convenient to the O2 and Canary Wharf, but a bit of a trip to Central London. Breakfast was good. Only problem was the A/C, or the lack thereof. Window only partially opens and I faced the highway, so it was either be hot or listen to the traffic. Hotel could've been good, but the sweltering room outweighed any positives."
84,1091,"Apr 11 2009 	Quiet hotel but wacky room temperature controls	This is a brand new hotel in the Docklands area of London, close to Canary Wharf, where many companies have their headquarters. It's quiet and I had no problems with noise. The rooms, though, are very odd. If the temperature controls function properly, they do so in a way that mystified me. The control panel said the temperature when I arrived was 24 degrees Celsius (which is very warm) so I set it for 19 C. An hour later the temperature panel said 25 C. No matter what I did, I could not get it below 23 C. The air in the room was very dry and the beds were hard, so I did not sleep well. The shower was excessively complicated and stung me with high-powered jets of water that I could not mute. The hot breakfast downstairs was good."
85,1091,"Apr 7 2009 	Fantastic Hotel with beautiful view	I had looked through tripadvisor, to find the perfect hotel in London. Didn't necessarily need to be in the center of town, but I focused more on how good the hotel was. It was down to the wire between the Marriott or Radisson Edwardian, and I'm really happy to have chosen the later. The rooms where really nice (very modern interior) and good size as well. The bathroom had both a tub and a shower. The only complaint (actually more of a preference) were the beds, they were really hard. Maybe you can get softer beds, but I didn't ask for it.The service was great and I would like to give a special thx to them for making our stay that much better.Location wise, if you wish to stay near the town center, the radisson is not for you. But if you like your evenings to be calm and relaxing this is. The Radisson Edwardian is in a really quiet area of town, so you won't be disturbed by street noise etc.Rooms were cleaned every day, excellent..The Money we spent on the two night stay was certainly worth the money, and I would love to stay there again when I return to London. If you choose to stay here make sure you have the breakfast, it's great and I promise you, you will not leave hungry. The hotel also had a Spa, Business Center (free of charge internet access computers) and more which is also great if you want to stay &quot;home&quot;.Absolutely worth the money......"
86,1091,"Apr 3 2009 	Relaxing venue with friendly helpful staff.	Very friendly well managed hotel. Exceptionally well presented.Staff could not be friendlier, they were a credit to their organisation."
87,1091,"Mar 31 2009 	Absolutely fantastic hotel I would definitely recommend to anyone fab location for the o2.	We stayed for our friends' birthdays in March 09 and had a wonderful time. All the staff we met were extremely friendly and welcoming. Both us and our friends had one bedroom suites which were absolutely amazing. The room had a huge suite area, bedroom and bathroom which was was fantastic. It had a large rainshower and a tv you could watch whilst in the bath! I also loved the fact that it had a massive mirror on one wall and a small pull out mirror on the opposite wall soThe rooms were modernly decorated and felt very luxurious. The hotel doesn't have parking onsite but you drive right up to the door and the concierge park your car for you. We went to the o2 for the evening and the location of the hotel was brilliant. You can actually see the dome across the river right outside the hotel. It only cost us 15 for the short taxi ride (about 10 minutes) which the hotel staff had offered to book for us when we checked in as there were no jubilee line tubes running that night. It was a perfect weekend! I can't fault it at all."
88,1091,Mar 30 2009 	Fabulous rooms. Great staff.	Stayed whilst attending a civil partnership. Stylish yet relaxed hotel. Wonderful rooms. Great staff. Nothing too much trouble.
89,1091,"Mar 30 2009 	Smart contemporary and efficient.	A very impressive contemporary hotel. I was staying whilst attending a wedding in London, but would very much recommend this hotel to business travellers. Very accessible for Docklands. The staff were very helpful in giving me advice on an area I did not know well at all. Rooms are contemporary and immaculate, as you would expect from a hotel in this class and price range. London hotels often disappoint - not this one."
90,1091,"Mar 24 2009 	Customer service poor and small things let it down	Being an Events Manager, running conference and incentive events both in the UK and abroad, I spend a fair amount of time in hotels. It never fails to surprise me that time and time again, the difference in service you get when you are organising and event and bringing a large revenue to the hotel, verses arriving with your partner as a normal customer. I booked this hotel for a birthday treat for my other half along with tickets for the 02. On arrival at the hotel, there was no one at the entrance to greet us and valet park our car that had been pre booked. Once sorting the car issue out, check in was smooth.We had a room on the 5th floor, in order to get the lift to work you have to insert your room key. After trying 2 lift, the 3rd lift finally worked, this continued for our entire stay and had 3 different room keys, and still the same problem.First impression of the room, other than it being so hot (28) was good, we had a nice view of the river and the dome. The bathroom was massive, with a large bath, separate shower, big enough of two. The room was well dressed, clean tidy and modern. However small thing start to let it down as you spend more time in the room1) The window only open a fraction, and the air con doesnt cool the room, in 24hrs we only managed to drop the temp to (24)2) The bedroom curtains dont cover the whole window, leaving a large gap for light to come streaming in, early morning3) The bathroom blind isnt wide enough, so whilst sitting on the toilet, or in the bath you are over looked by the flats opposite you.. not exactly private and the windows are floor to ceiling4) Room service, very limited after 10.30 at night. a ham sandwich of fish pie isnt exactly what you want at 12 at night when you get back from the 02, thankfully there is a McDonalds 10 mins walk away.5) The bar is small, service is really slow and no where to sit, and it was cheaper to drink from the mini bar in our room, than drinks in the bar. 12.80 for 2 drinks is over priced for this hotel6) Be warned breakfast is 17.00 per person... another stop at MacDonaldsAs i say these are small things, but they do take away from the experience. For me when I stay at a hotel, I expect a level of service and facilities and not have to spend a night sweating, woken early as the curtains dont close, and to be able to use the bathroom in private.Check out was ok, when asked if we enjoyed our stay, we addressed a few of the issues, but the reception staff, didnt really have reply. After a night of only a few hours sleep I didnt have the time or patience to take the matter any further, but again another small detail that makes you walk away from the hotel feeling negative. A simple we are sorry and we will address these issues would have been enough.And finally... a word of warning, if you like your car and want it to be taken care of... then dont trust the valet parking service at this hotel. nor expect them to do anything about if they damage your car!After waiting 10 mins for our car, straight away we noticed that the radio Ariel had been snapped off and was now bent in two hanging off the roof.After much arguing, at the entrance of the hotel, with everyone looking on... the hotel's solution was to fix it with black tape. After more arguing it was clear that they were going to do nothing about it, and after spending an hour trying to resolve the matter it was pointless to waste any further time at the hotel. We drove away, far from amused, and will never be staying here again. Not only have they lost two customers, they have also lost any business for any future events I run, and would also have to carefully consider using a Radisson hotels full stop. When will hotels learn that customer services and little touches make the difference. Its not that difficult to get it right, but clearly here. they couldnt care less.If you simply want somewhere to sleep, close to the o2 then you will be fine, but if you want a hotel experience, for a special event, where you want to feel special and treated as a guest rather than just a number, then dont bother."
91,1091,"Mar 24 2009 	Very friendly excellent hotel!!	We booked a one night stay at the Radisson Edwardian New Providence hotel for my wife's birthday, from start to finish it was a very enjoyable stay. We took advantage of the on site valet parking as it was so much easier just to drive in, I have to say I was surprised how easy it was to get there, much better than lugging suitcases across London on the tube. Once there we were greeted by the reception staff who were very helpful,and after a speedy check-in our luggage was taken to our room. The room was very spacious and new, all the normal amenities that you would expect in a 4 star hotel but all to a very high standard.My wife had booked treatments at the Spa that is in the hotel, she said that it was lovely and the staff were very friendly, as she pampered herself I took advantage of the free gym. It was big and all the equipment appeared new. They have some free weights (good enough for a free weight work out) and numerous weight machines. Plus treadmills, rowers, cross trainers, bikes and steppers. Don't forget your swim wear as they have a sauna and steam room as well. There is a swimming pool over the road from the hotel, but you do have to pay.Canary Wharf is about a 10 minute walk away, so not to taxing and they have maps at Reception to help you find your way.All in all I found the hotel to be at a very high standard and I will definitely be staying there again."
92,1091,"Mar 20 2009	the service was dreadful no communication and when we had no hot water in the morning there was no apology	we were there for a wedding. the spa was lovley however the service and staff was dreadul as well as no hot water!When we arrived we asked for 2 bath robes for after the spa. when we arrived back 2 hours latter had to remind housekeeping to bring them up. We had room service on the friday night - it took 1 hour we asked for the burger to be well done it wasnt. when we sent it back it was brought back to us with the bun burnt and with an explanation that the burger could not be well done and was dried up and had not even been touched by the cheif - the message we got was &quot;the cheif says that these burgers are so big they cannot be well done&quot;. We then drove to macdonald on the roundabout as we were starving.There were 2 phones in the room one that had the screen surrounded by buttons with &quot;reception&quot; &quot;housekepping&quot; etc broke on the friday night. From the smaller phone by the bed I could only press 0 which took ages to get to reception I asked for someone to come up and have a look at it. this was 8pm. By the time we left on Sunday morning it was still broke.That evening I had meet a client in the bar for a drink. I signed for it to be put on my room. As I was walking out of the bar with my client the waiter came over and loudly said that I had no credit and would need to pay cash. I explained that he needed to check with reception which he did whilst I stood a waited with my client. He came back and said &quot;oh yes sorry that is right&quot; the damaged had been done in front of my client. In the morning I went to the gym and came back to shower. NO HOT WATER. When I tried ringing on the other phone again it took ages to get to reception. I was told politly by a lady on the other end that the line I had rang on put me through to head office in either Gatwick or Heathrow and I had to wait to be put through to my hotel reception!!When I said that there was no hot water i was told the the boiler was not working - no apology and no explanation to why nobody had contacted us.We then had to wait for buckets of water to be brought up! I then pushed and said this wasnt good for 2 girls going to a wedding! after alot of persuading on my part they talked to the health club ACROSS THE ROAD for us to shower - which was my idea. They really didnt seem bothered that we had no hot water. The duty manager said to ask for her when I was checking out and she would sort out something.When Sunday came to check out she was no where to be seen. The receptionist didnt care we had such a rotten stay and I had to reiterate what had happened during our stay. All she could offer was the money taken off from the food.I was also charged full price for parking - which we had a concession becasue of being part of the wedding party, again I had to challange this and reluctantly gave us the discount.I emailed the manger of the hotel with my complaints - he offered me to stay there again free - if they were not fully booked. I then contacted head office with this complaint and said I would not want to stay there again and what could they offer me for compensation? This was last August 08 I didnt here any thing back.I have never written on these sites before and have stayed in many hotels and different venues around the world and let a lot of things ride but if I have felt the need to complain if I have received an apology I am happy. But with no apology and any comensation to this horrible stay with bad communication between staff, dreadfull food and service then I felt compeled to write this!"
93,1091,"Mar 18 2009 	Couldn't ask for more...	Excellent hotel, fantastic helpful staff. No complaints about anything."
94,1091,"Feb 25 2009 	Very Welcoming Very Comfortable Good menu and gorgeous decor	My check in at the hotel couldn't of gone any faster or smoother. On arrival my car was valet parked at a low cost, immediately leaving me with no worries about having to pay a fortune for local parking nearby, and the doubt of any security if left on a street. There was plenty of staff available during check in, often a problem at most places, but not here and check in was painless.The room (a delux king) was just as described and pictured, often a false impression is given by marketing, but it was exactly what was described and pictured, and at a very good rate for a radisson in London.Travel into the centre was no problem, with a train service only a 3 - 5 minute walk around the corner, and then a 10-15 minute journey into the centre, stopping about 4/5 stops.We also had dinner in the restaurant and the service and food couldn't be faulted.Many thanks to the staff and i'd definately stop again!"
95,1091,"Feb 23 2009 	Fantastic Hotel... Brilliant place for Valentines Day	I booked up this hotel for Valentines Day as my Girlfriend had a really tough year and I wanted to give her a treat that she more than deserved. I chose to stay in a deluxe room which was modern, clean and very spacious. I paid an extra 40 pounds for a river view and was not disappointed!! It was amazing at night to have the curtains open and see the o2 lighting up the river. The bathroom was fantastic and had probably the biggest bath I've ever bathed in. The service at the hotel was phenominal and they were always happy to help. An alarm went off in the room next to ours at 6:00am and we called down to reception who within 3 minutes, came up to turn it off. The buffet breakfast was delicious and I would definately stay there again. Only bad point was that for authorisation the bank held full payment on top of my nights stay so for a couple of days it looked like I had been charged double what I should have, this all depends on what Bank you are with but do bare in mind if you are staying at this hotel to have more than enough money in your account but it all went back in 3 days later."
96,1091,"Feb 19 2009 	Perfect for an overnight business stay - friendly and comfortable	I found this hotel delightful. The reception staff were friendly, helpful and polite. The decor was pleasantly modern and neutral. The room was superbly comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was fabulous. And the room rate was very reasonable.I'd definately stay here again."
97,1091,"Feb 18 2009 	Decent rooms Awful service	I travelled to London with my husband and my sister and her husband. We booked 2 rooms at the hotel (504 &amp; 505) because of its location and the reviews on this site. We were watching a show at the 02 (Russell Peters) at the weekend. We are couples in their late 20's, early 30's. Just to put into context, me and my husband travel alot. We often stay at 4-5 star luxury hotels both here and abroad. I haven't to date been moved to write a review so this is a first.First dealing with the plus points, check in was nice and easy. The decor throughout the hotel was modern and contemporary. The bedrooms/bathrooms were a reasonable size for London although the view from both rooms left alot to be desired! checking out was fairly simple although we had to wait abit.Now dealing with the negatives. A modern clean hotel does make not a 4 star. The service throughout our stay was appalling. Firstly, dealing with the night of our arrival, we drove to the hotel and having decided that the best way for us to travel to the 02 was by car, we asked reception, the concierge and security as we were leaving the carpark for directions. No one could provide directions! For a hotel that markets itself as being in close proximity to the 02, it clearly needs to get its act together.However, my main gripe was the breakfast! This was served from 7.30-10.30am. We came down at 10.00. We waited for someone to show us to our seating area. The lady at the front continued to talk into her mouthpiece for what seemed like ages whilst we waited. She eventually showed us to a table overlooking the river and told us someone will be coming to take our tea/coffee order. The table she showed us to had not been cleared away. There was a used coffee? cup on the table where my brother in law was sat. We could see at least 3 members of staff milling about .We waited for approx 10 mins for someone to come over and take our drinks order before eventually giving up and walking to the hot buffet. Their were no hot plates! there was a good variety however, my sister wanted a fried egg and had to wait because no one had bother to re fill the tray. We sat down to breakfast and seeing their was no margarine/butter in the buffet area or on our table, we asked a staff member. She disappeared and failed to come back to us at all. We then proceeded to ask at least two other staff members to no avail. My husband eventually got up and spoke to the lady at the front who picked two small margarine plates of another table and handed them to him. our coffee was served after we had finished breakfast.We then went back to our room to have a shower having requested late checkout (which was extended to 1pm). The water was at best lukewarm. We rang reception who sent someone up to check. He having checked agreed and told us that the problem was the hot water was sourced from outside and he would go and speak to them and then revert back to us. We waited for 20 mins and then called reception who told us the boiler needed 20 mins to heat up and and we should then try again. 2mins later our room buzzer went and the male returned to tell us that the problem will take 20 mins to resolve and we should then try again! By this point we'd had enough and just wanted to leave. We did intend to book some treatments at the spa but following our experience with the shower we decided to give it a miss! Lets say I will not be staying at the Raddison anytime soon."
98,1091,"Feb 11 2009 	'Strictly' lovely	I recently stayed at the Radisson for one night with my sister as we had tickets to 'Strictly Come Dancing Live' at the O2. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful reception staff. Check in was quick and easy. Our twin bedded room was very comfortable and nicely decorated as was the bathroom. Both rooms were exceptionally clean. We didn't have an evening meal in the restaurant so can't comment but the buffet breakfast in the morning was very good - everything you could want was there. The bar in the evening had a nice atmosphere although, to be expected, bar prices were on par with the rest of the London hotels! I would definitely stay again if I had a concert/show to see at the O2."
99,1091,"Feb 8 2009 	Good hotel for an overnight at Canary Wharf or the O2	Want a good, newly built hotel, close to Canary Wharf and the O2 arena? And at a good price too? Then try this.Only two years old and very modern in styling the NPW Radisson is a hidden gem. If you are a first time visitor you'll be escorted to your room, shown all it's features and then 15 mins later reception give you a call to make sure all is well.Stayed on business for one night and will probably stay again next month. Didnt use all the facilities but the room was very comfortable, the bar area very comtemporary and the restuarant menu looked good.If you are in Canary Wharf on business then arguably it is walkable if the weather is nice else it is a short cab ride or on departure take the free shuttle bus back into the wharf."
100,1091,"Feb 4 2009 	Great value quality London hotel	Very new hotel, down by the Thames, over the river from the O2 Arena.Spacious rooms.Great bathrooms.Very helpful staff.Slightly overpriced breakfasts.Good value overall for London.Very handy for Canary Wharf offices, with a free shuttle to and from the hotel."
101,1091,"Feb 3 2009	Very bad billing system	The stay itself was fine. Nothing disasterous (had some problem with the TV which took three calls to the reception to get someone to fix it, but I thought it was tolerable) and nothing outstanding.But a month later an unexpected credit card charge and the unhelpful attitude over the phone from their staff left a very bad taste in my mouth. It was not a fraudulent charge, but when I checked out of the room and paid for the final invoice I had expected all charges related to the room to be included. Hence my surprise when an additional charge (for room service) appeared later in my credit card statement.The Radisson staff I spoke to on the phone was very impolite. According to him, there are different 'windows' and the room service charge had been in a different window to the other charges.I tried to point out that as a customer, I don't understand and don't care about those 'windows'. I had not requested the room service charge to be in a 'different window'. When I checked out, no one at front desk told me about this 'other window'. Anyway, I just wanted to suggest that they review their procedures. He was adamant there was nothing wrong on their part, and I should have checked.So, a word of warning for those who plan to stay there... beware of the 'windows' and the unhelpful incompetent staff."
102,1091,"Jan 31 2009 	Nice Hidden Gem	We were originally slated to stay at a nice boutique hotel in Chiswick, but the Radisson had FANTASTIC winter rates on their webiste - far lower than what you'd expect - so we decided to switch hotels and take a chance. This hotel did not disappoint - in fact, it exceeded my pretty high expectations that had already been set forth by other TripAdvisor reviewers!If you're looking to stay in an area of London with some of the best dockside scenery, Canary Wharf is where you want to go. This hotel sits right on the Thames and has some stunning views - especially of the O2 Arena at night. Despite being a little out of the way, this hotel is extremely quiet and peaceful - something perfect for a nice vacation getaway.The DLR stop closest to the hotel is Blackwall. It's about a 3.5-5 minute walk - nice and convenient, especially if the Tube is your primary transport in and around London. While Canary Wharf is about 20 minutes outside of central London (on the Tube), if you're in the area for a leisurely trip, I see no problem with staying at this hotel. My only complaint with the hotel's location is that it's situated on a cul-de-sac facing the Thames (which accounts for the stellar views!) - it can be a bit tricky to find just how to get to the front door at first, especially with all the construction going on around the property (note - the construction did not present any sort of noise issues with us at all from inside the property).The rooms were a nice size. Very modern, well kept, and clean. The beds were a little too hard for my liking, but if you call the front desk for an extra blanket to sleep on, then the bed, at least for me, is soft enough to get a good night's sleep. The bathroom has all modern fixtures and features a heated mirror, heated towel rack, an outlet for 120V appliances, separate bath and rain-style shower. I've never raved so much about a hotel bathroom before. Our view, like other reviewers have stated, was of an office building next door (we didn't care, we came to London to walk around the city and not stare out a window) - I have a feeling if you stay in one of their Deluxe rooms, you'll have a nice view of the Thames.There was also free WiFi access in the rooms - which ended up being a nice surprise.The staff were very friendly and helpful. We ordered quite a bit of room service, which was very reasonably priced. Room service was not only super quick, but VERY good and worth the money. As another reviewer suggested, try the Hotel Ibis next door for breakfast - at only 6 pounds, it's cheaper, and offers more than the Radisson's breakfast (alternatively there's also a McDonald's across the street as well). However, on the weekends, the Radisson does offer a stellar breakfast buffet that is not only less expensive, but offers double the selection - highly recommended. Dinner at the Radisson can be a little pricey, but I assure you the food is amazing. As there's really only one other restaurant near the hotel (a nice italian bistro that we didn't try), I'd recommend the hotel restaurant (or room service!) if you find yourself tired and hungry. There's also a small market about a block up from the hotel near the East India Quay DLR station where you can pick up light meals and snacks.The bar was nice as well. The bar tender was very sweet and made the best amaretto sour I've ever had. I'm not sure if he wasn't 100% sure what went in it, or if amaretto sours are just a tad different in London - had some different ingredients, but it tasted great! Little pricey, but considering the hotel, it's about what you'd expect.Didn't use any of the spa services (though the spa looks very nice, and the receptionist was a very friendly lady), but the gym is top notch. All brand new, heavy duty equipment - served as a perfect replacement for the gym back home. Features 2 rowing machines, 2 stair climbers, 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, weights, balance balls, mats and a nice view over-looking the area.Overall I would most likely stay here again, especially if I can nab such a stellar price. Beautiful property, gorgeous location, well-kept rooms, and a friendly staff are hard to beat!"
103,1091,"Jan 29 2009 	Absolutely Wonderful!	Had a wonderful stay here recently and completely fell in love with the atmosphere and location. I usually stay at the Four Seasons, and was worried I would be dissapointed in the room size and bathroom at the Radisson Edwardian, but it couldn't have been better. This hotel is well located (despite my concerns) and offers a much more residential, cozy and warmer atmosphere - I was genuinely made to feel special and not just like 'another guest'. My room was exquisite and beautifully furnished, but not at all over-the-top - everything was immaculately clean. Sublimely comfortable chairs, with a lamp and side table right where you need it make this the kind of hotel room you want to curl up and really live in. The staff definitely work to achieve this friendly atmosphere - I was impressed by the ownerships that staff gave to any issues raised. Two pointers:1) Book via the hotel's own website. I shopped around for days only to find that I ended up back on their own site for the best rates! 2) Try the hotel's restaurant - we ended up dining their almost by accident due to a last minute change of plans and the food and service was genuinely second-to-none. A very nice touch was the phone call from the club concierge the night before my departure, asking if I needed him to arrange an airport transfer or to print boarding passes. Again, its all in the details. Overall, a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back."
104,1091,Jan 28 2009 	fantastic at the Radisson new providence wharf	We recentley stayed at the Radisson New Providence Wharf hotel everything about this hotel l found to be exellent from the very helpfull friendly staff to the above standard rooms the breakfast was exellent.The position of the hotel itself is great lets hope they can get a ferry service going to get you into the centre of london cannot say enough good things about this hotel.
105,1091,"Jan 27 2009 	really loved this hotel	We stayed for a weekend while visiting friends and amil in London. Hotel is easy to find and we used valet parking so it was very easy if not cheap) to park . We went for the smallest room a superior king and were very pleasantly surprised. We had a view of the Thames and the room was very spacious for a London hotel, in particular the bathroom which had a seperate bath and shower . the room was very clean and had everything we needed for the weekend .The hotel was pretty quiet and the staff were therefore very attentive and friendly. Not sure how far it s from the stations but was great location for driving at the weekend"
106,1091,"Jan 5 2009	Wouldn't Stay - couldn't even get a drink !	I have not stayed at this hotel, but wouldn't if the terrible service and awful food in the Azura Bar and Restaurant is anything to go by.This is not one to be recommended. It's a Four Star Hotel with a Zero Star Service Ethic."
107,1091,"Dec 25 2008 	Functional but not a lot else	I have rated this hotel as &quot;above average&quot; because I think it is, but at the same time it does have some downsides to it.The room was very comfortable - a little compact perhaps and hanging your clothes in the toilet was rather odd, but one of the most comfy hotel rooms I have ever stayed in.The service was not really that good. The staff are young and local, and although they were always willing, they were not exactly what I would describe as &quot;accomplished&quot;.Room service was &quot;interesting&quot;. Red Wine was served in an ice bucket, twice. I was not very impressed by their interpretation of the Club Sandwich (served on Focaccia).Overall though, the niggles I had were minor and nothing really to complain about.I picked this hotel because I wanted to stay in the area and I didn't want to pay the prices charged by the hotels on the Canary Wharf estate itself. I would say that I did get value for money in that regard."
108,1091,"Dec 21 2008 	Good stay if the price works for you	We stayed here 20th December as we were seeing the Stereophonics at the O2. We were impressed on the whole and will be returning.We parked behind the hotel (the road running up from majestic wines) as it was the weekend so no parking retractions, which saved the 25 valet park, which is over the top as there is a lot of open space around the hotel.Nice room and bathroom. We like a firm bed, others may find it too firm. Didn't hear a thing once our door was shut, nice and quiet from the outside as well as only residential areas adjacent to the hotel.We had the wasteland, main road and MacDonald's view others have commented on. Someone else has mentioned and I agree that the hotel is positioned the wrong way round, I would suspect you've got 80% of the rooms facing walls in other buildings or wasteland, and the other 20% overlooking the water and the O2, which seems like a missed opportunity to me.Getting to the O2 was easy, DLR from Blackwall to Canning Town then the tube to North Greenwich. I've seen comments of DLR being up to 15 minutes walk from the hotel, don't believe a word of it, it takes around half of than time. Best routes I could see are taking the underpass opposite the Ibis or cross the slip road behind majestic, follow the wall to the left and then head right to the DLR station. There did seem to be some work being carried out at the station, so there may be a more direct route in the future.The only food or service that we had at the hotel was breakfast, which was included in the room rate. This was in a room overlooking the O2, which was nice, service was not good, we were giving the impression that they had never been asked for something as ridiculous as a breakfast for a 'vegetarian' before, despite us being the only ones in the dining room (we left about 40 minutes after breakfast started to be served and no other guests had come in for breakfast, but we do tend to be early risers) it took the kitchen 25 minutes to put something together (maybe sometimes they do a buffet, not on this particular day though).Overall I would stay again, we have two events at O2 next year, but I would have to weigh up the parking cost in the final decision as these are both mid week events."
109,1091,"Dec 10 2008 	Check room if you want view	Great modern hotel but a little clinical. Staff were excellent, friendly and very helpful. Advertised as having &quot;stunning rverside views&quot; but our room looked out over waste land and a major road, and into the living rooms of flats in the adjacent building. Car parking available but at a charge of 25 per day."
110,1091,Nov 17 2008 	Pricey but very well presented	Stayed for one night Bed only (didn't take the 33.00 breakfast as its 6.50 a head just down the road at the IBIS) room was a techies dream. Bed was HARD but all facilities are new and the staff were very helpful and accomodating. The Free newspaper was not available as their delivery never materialised on the Saturday morning. We hadn't factored in the VAT addition to our website quoted booking price but that was our oversight not theirsStayed there to do a concert at O2 which is the other side of the river. D'oh. Taxi was OK albeit pricey to get there and back.
111,1091,"Oct 17 2008 	Great modern hotel  good location for O2 stadium	Stayed here overnight when we went to see the Spice Girls at the O2.The hotel has a great location, just outside of the reception area, you can look across the river over to the O2.It is a very modern hotel in a fairly quiet location in docklands, nice clean rooms, good breakfast, there is also a spa but we did not have time to use it. All the fixtures and fittings are modern and contemporary in design.Please note the hotel is not withing walking distance of the 02 but it is only a 5 minute walk to the local docklands light railway and then it is just a couple of stops to the O2nice play to stay"
112,1091,"Oct 11 2008 	great stay	lovely room, very clean and modern. Bathroom fantastic. staff friendly and food good!"
113,1091,"Oct 6 2008 	Good hotel but some MAJOR front of house issues	We stayed in this hotel when we went to see a show at the O2. The best thing about this hotel, as we discovered when we arrived, is it's proximity to the venue. However, we did encounter some huge problems with the hotel.On the day that we were due to arrive, I rang ahead to confirm what DLR station was nearest to the hotel, which the staff told me. We arrived at said station, could see no sight of the hotel so rang the hotel back and they informed us that we were in fact at the wrong station. I asked how long it would take to get to the hotel, and was told it was a 15 minute drive away (we were already on a tight schedule to get to the venue on time). I asked the hotel to ring us a taxi, and was told (in a city centre hotel!) that this was not a service they offered and I could ring a taxi myself if I liked. I insisted that they ring one for me, and was told it would be 10 minutes (it ended up with a 25 minute wait for the taxi, making us very late).Everything as fine with the hotel, we had a lovely room in the hotel and found breakfast the next morning very much to our satisfaction! But we then encountered more problems when we checked out. I went to pay using my credit card, knowing there was more than enough available to cover the cost of the night's stay. I was told that my card had declined. I asked them to try again, but when it didn't work, I offered a debit card to pay instead, as we had to get to the station to catch a train. When at the station I rang the bank to find out what the problem had been. they informed me that when we had checked in, the receptionist that had dealt with us had taken 100 from my credit card as a guarantee, without telling me that this would happen, or checking that this was ok. I have stayed in many hotels all over the country and indeed internationally, and have never encountered anything like this before. When I arrived home, I checked my bank account online to find a deficit of 460. I rang the bank again, and was told that all of the money missing had in fact been taking by the Radisson hotel. I rang the hotel several times to first be told that I had made a mistake, then be told that there was nothing that they could do, and then finally be told that it was in fact their mistake and my card had been used to authorise payment for a further 3 nights stay, something entirely unnecessary given that I was only staying for 1 night! Having spoken to about 8 different people (all claiming to be managers, none of whom could help!), and the general manager of the hotel, I am still trying to get a refund on monday morning for money incorrectly debited from my account on saturday, a very long time when there is no rhyme or reason for why the money was taken in the first place!This seems like a very good hotel on the surface, but there is many problems with their front-of-house, reception and accounts staff and we will not be staying there again."
114,1091,"Sep 29 2008 	Losing it's touch already	Stayed here April this year, rated it very highly, and had no hesitation in booking it again, but their standards are slipping, In my room (422) the curtain was hanging off the rail, several light bulbs were not working and there were strange stains on the faux leather headboard. You get no bathrobes (doesn't seem to be a feature), the tea and coffee selction is abysmal - regular or camomile tea and instant coffee, that's it , it was difficult to phone a colleague in another room (no instructions for the phone) and a message light winking which took some time to cancel out (it was a message asking for my input.) At the reception desk I heard a guest complaining that their remote control didn't work, another had left his credit card at the desk, and they had mislaid it. Come on guys, surely you can do better than this. it's a fairly new hotel, get your houskeeping and maintenance teams back around the hotel and fix these problems before they become major ones and I go somewhere else next time I stay in the Docklands area"
115,1091,"Sep 20 2008 	Modern business hotel near Canary Wharf	This hotel is a modern business hotel within ten minutes walk of Canary Wharf. It is found on the north bank of the Thames, opposite the O2 arena. Unless you are staying on business or wishing to attend a concert, I struggle to see why you would stay here. Having said this, the hotel is modern (Bang &amp; Olufsen televisions in the room), clean and well proportioned. The restaurant is reasonable value however the hotel clearly markets itself to visitors to Canary Wharf with prices to match. An enjoyable stay, but unlikely to be repeated unless I intend to travel to Canary Wharf."
116,1091,"Sep 8 2008 	Disappointing experience in the Radisson	The hotel is brand new and first impression was great. Nice room, quiet and bit small. Bathroom very nice and very trendy. I went out to do some sports and so left things of value in the room and turned on the NOT DISTURB sign, so expected nobody would enter. Foolish I was to think that house keeping would respect the NOT DISTURB sign. They went in the room anyway to make the bed and turned off the NOT DISTRUB sign. A couple of hours later when I came back the room was cleaned, luckily my things of value were still in the room, but very annoying.I changed and went out for the night and put on the hen I came back late at the heating was changed from a nice and cool 20 degrees to a 26 degrees SAUNA which made it impossible to fall a sleep for an other hour or so. (the time needed to cool of the room). When I complained the receptionist said &quot;we will inform house keeping&quot;, which I very much doubt they did. The morning after this experience I had a flight from city airport at 7am, which is actually great since by taxi it's only 10 minutes. Never the less I requested a wake-up call at 5:15 and a taxi at 5:45. Luckily I set my own alarm, because I am still awaiting the wake up call from the hotel. When I complained the receptionist said &quot;well it's marked in the book&quot;. The radisson sais on there television system if there is any service you do not like you get your money back and now you think they make a gesture??? No way. Not that I was looking for refund, but the personel didn't even appologies, they just say we will inform house keeping or well your wake-up call was supposed to be done, since we marked in the book. When you read this you might think I am picky, which I'm not. Luckily the cleaning lady in the hotel didn't fancy some extra cash or a nice expensive watch and luckily I set my own alarm and did not miss my 7 am flight. There are just little things that you can and that you can't do. For a 150 pounds per night you might expect a little different service of the personell."
117,1091,"Sep 3 2008 	Something else than Bayswater/Earls Court...	This stay was booked at a price of about NOK 860 (approx. $160) a night for a superior room, including taxes and full english breakfast. Taken the breakfast into consideration, for this price we could get a 2/3 star hotel in Bayswater or Earls Court. These hotels I've experienced and can not say the hotels are compareable at all. This is a hotel with sound proof walls, spacious bathroom, both shower and tub, flat screen tv and free wi-fi internet.Compared to Bayswater/Earls Court I would guess you'll have to spend about 10 more minutes to get into central London (Leicester Square/Covent Garden). But probably you'll need a tube travel card anyway and Canary Wharf can offer the most of shopping, eating and drinking.Do notice that I don't think twin rooms are available. But the double bed was king size."
118,1091,"Aug 27 2008 	Cool atmosphere all over	Great hotel, located in the docklands close to Canary Wharf.If you want to be close to the city centre this is not for you, but if you like to do the city in smaller portions and focus more on relaxing and shopping this is a very very nice place to stay.Shopping was excellent @ Canary Wharf Jubilee line station, and @ Canary wharf itself. Within walking distance.There was a spa where use of wet area and relaxation room was complimentary. Also i recommen Il Bianci - a nice italian restaurant 100 meters from the Hotel.The hotel bar had a nice atmosphere to it and outside speakers gave a loungy feel to the place. The standards of the hotel were generally 1st class and the staff very helpfull indeed."
119,1091,"Aug 15 2008 	Comfortable	Very happy with the standard of this hotel. Quite new so it should be. FREE internet in business lounge unlike others of this chain. If you are visiting London to see the sights then I would not suggest this hotel.Location, a little hard to find. Long walk from canary wharf tube. Their is dtr rail very close though. A distance from the usual tourist sights.Outlook over the river to the entertainment centre. This looks like a circus tent with chopsticks sticking through it. Night has a lazer crossing the sky. I was lucky to witness a lightening displayed by nature and it was free. Staff fine, only they were not educated in the area the hotel sits. Asked about local pubs as did not want to go to the snooty expensive ones by the wharfs and got lost looks. Went for a walk -a -bout and found three. Locals singing and having a good time with life at 6pm. Rare for me, I had dinner in the hotel. GOOD it was. Breakfast buff sufficient. Room has the lot and is very confortable."
120,1091,"Aug 12 2008 	Smart and Contemporary	My Husband and I, stayed at this hotel for one night, as part of a concert package (with Superbreak) We went to a concert at the O2 arena, which is directly opposite the hotel across the Thames. We would recommend this hotel (as well as the O2). The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The room was lovely, very modern and comfortable. The bathroom was equally as lovely, with a smart walk in shower. There are tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The buffet breakfast was very nice, good choice, well presented. We were told that there may be a boat across to the O2 in the future, this would be very useful. The only inconvenience regarding our break (which is nothing to do with the hotel) was having to pay 15 each way, to get to/from the O2 by taxi. I have made a suggestion to the hotel, that a hotel shuttle service, at a lesser charge would be wonderful. I hope they consider it, as it would attract more O2 customers to stay at their impressive hotel. The hotel is near to Canary Wharf station, and the DLR is opposite the hotel. We would stay there again, and recommend that others do too!"
121,1091,"Aug 12 2008 	great hotel great postion for canary wharf o2	superb hotel, great position 5 minutes walk from dlr ( blackwalls) under the underpass, lovely rooms great service, what more can i say!!"
122,1091,"Aug 7 2008 	A good experience	Used this hotel as a stopover after visiting the Motor show and evening concert at the Excel Centre. A very clean modern place .Lovely room with all mod cons.Good check in and nice seating area outside overlooking river. Breakfast was included but expensive for self service if you are paying separately. We did not eat dinner at the hotel ,but found a recommended Italian just round the corner-Il Bianco -which had great food and lovely staff.The efficient air conditioning was welcome on a very hot night.Did not have a chance to use leisure facilities .My only criticism was the walk from the DLR was longer than expected and not particulaly nice ,being near thr Blackwall Tunnel-also no directions to entrance-you have to walk round the block past the Ibis. At night it felt a bit unsafe."
123,1091,"Jul 23 2008 	Good business hotel	Rooms were a fair size, were clean with modern decor. Nice to have a B&amp;O TV with a decent internet service. Near enough to Canary Wharf (5 minutes by cab) and decent restaurants (recommend Gaucho for fantastic steak - the best I've had outside of Buenos Aires)."
124,1091,"Jul 10 2008	Completely Inadequate	I was stranded in London around the time of the Rugby World Cup Final when I couldn't get a ticket on Eurostar. I had heard about this hotel and generally liking Radisson SAS hotel in Europe I thought I would give it a try. It was one of the most unplesant evenings I have ever had in a hotel. Location: It is located in a hideous area in the Wharfs surrounded by security and while the development is new inside step out of the secure area and you are confronted with some pretty ugly scenes. There was noting around except a dingy McDonalds. Strolls were out of the question. But that was ok...so I thought. The staff seemed completely overwhelemed with me as a walk-in and kept my driver and I waiting more than 25 minutes while they tried to figure out if a room was available. This in a hotel that was nowhere near full. The room was dark, dingy, and difficult to operate and I stay in a lot of hotels. The halls were noisy filled with party-goers attending some function, which I could not determine. The food was overpriced and terrible (although the waiter was nice) When I checked-out in the mornig they arranged a car for me to the train station with an incompetent and dangerous driver who got lost on the way. I expect so much more from Radisson in Europe. I will not be returning."
125,1091,"Jul 7 2008 	Good stay - but a walk from stations	Excellent new hotel - good size rooms with modern decor and electronics, fast internet service, nice service, very nice + relaxing spa-area!But a 20min. walk from underground or 10min. from DLR! Construction going on nearby and busy traffic during the day... Check-in very friendly but took 40min. to &quot;find&quot; our online-booking! Would recommend if you can work with 30min. commute to the city! Very convenient for City Airport!Heavy priced breakfast! Excellent small Italian restaurant around the corner!!"
126,1091,"Jul 3 2008 	Fantastic!	My sisters and I stayed at the hotel as we went to see Neil Diamond at the o2 arena.It was a fantstic experience for us and the hotel is fab.The rooms are very clean, modern and they think of everything that you could want.We had ice for our champagne and a docking station for my ipod so we could get ready in style.The bathrooms are great and although other people have said about the dispensors on the wall......well that didn't really bother us.Breakfast was great and there was lots of choice. We had breakfast included in our rate but on sunday they were doing a special for only 10.....not bad at all.The only thing that I think they could do is have some proper coffee in the rooms as it is a 4* business hotel.Loved it, and will definitely go back when I go to the o2."
127,1091,"Jun 29 2008 	Pure incompetence	Had arranged for some relatives to stay at the Radisson Edwardian for two nights around our wedding day. They had flown over from different countries and we wanted to give them the best impression. Also, we live next door to the hotel. BEWARE: at reception English is an optional and smiles are not part of the package. The fun starts now: we instructed them to charge my credit card - someone made copies of it, and I signed a mandate for a 3rd party payment. Only now we discovered that they charged our guests! We are packing to go on honeymoon tomorrow and they cannot rectify it because their accounting department is closed (yeah it's 10:30pm) and will have to return there tomorrow morning. They gave me an appointment at 8 tomorrow morning. I wonder if there will be a queue then. I have the strange feeling that I am doing someone else's job ... isn't it just pure incompetence?"
128,1091,May 20 2008	Amazing Hotel And Stuff	It was an amazing hotel with amazing people working in it. We went there they welcomed us like they knew us from long time the room (suite) were very very well decorated the view perfect.Everything was perfect . Everyone must go to this hotel.
129,1091,"Apr 22 2008 	Nice hotel but some issues	Nice hotel, but some teething issues and some problems with staff. The location for me was perfect, because it's right where I used to live when I lived in London, and also it was walking distance from where I needed to be every day on that trip. Nice area, right by the river, but I guess it's inconvenient if you need to go to West End, for example.Room was nice, clean and comfortable - modern design, all amenities in place. No closet for your clothes, though - only an open area with hangers in the bathroom. I didn't appreciate the bottles of shampoo / shower gel and conditioner to be fixed on the wall - after all, this is supposed to be a 4* deluxe property. Soap + other toiletries would be nice. Main light in my shower didn't work - I asked reception to have that fixed, but no action was taken.Room service was quite good (I had dinner once), although it took me 5-10 minutes to reach them in room service - no one was picking up, and in-room breakfast was really nice - again, however, small things let it down - they would forget some small things I ordered, but there'd be something I didn't order on the tray. Staff generally was formally polite, but somewhat aloof and ... weird in their dealings with me. It seemed like either lack of experience or, on the other hand, arrogance of some sort.Also, strange thing happened - I ordered a mini-cab once, and when he came, the driver asked the reception to contact me in my room, but they told him that nobody was picking up. All this time I was in my room waiting by the phone, and of course it never rang - what was it, I will never know.So, overall good hotel, that is let down by some minor things. Human factor, mostly."
130,1091,"Apr 8 2008 	Superb hotel but miles from anywhere	This hotel is a fantastic one - comfort and service levels superb. Room very spacious, nicely decorated, with iPod dock and sound system, nice flat-screen TV mounted on the wall (in theory I should have been able to plug my laptop in so I could view it on the big screen but it didn't work) and an interesting bathroom.Breakfast was of a good standard with plenty of variety, although no cold milk (one of my pet hates about hotels) for the cereal.The hotel is quite a walk from public transport, if you are not a fan of paying through the nose for London taxis. The nearest station is a good 10 minute walk away, and the station itself is a fair old trek on the Docklands Light Railway and London Underground from the main sights of the city."
131,1091,"Apr 3 2008 	Lovely Hotel good for the O2	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to attend Eagles Concert at the O2. Beautiful Hotel, very clean, new and modern, good facilities in the room, including B&amp;O LCD TV, Alarm Clock with iPod Connection,Tea/Coffee making facilities, full bathroom with separate shower and toiletry dispensers.Loved the electronic Do not Disturb and Please Service the Room, switched on from just inside the door, so no looking for tag's to place on the door.Try and get a rate where breakfast is included, as if not it's an additional 16.50To get to the O2 the nearest DLR station is East India Dock, which is an easy 5-7 minute walk. One stop on DLR to Canning Town then 1 stop to Greenwich on Jubilee LIne for O2. However check before you travel for disruptions to this service, as whilst we were there the DLR was closed for engineering works so had to taxi to the O2 which was 15 each way.IF you park your car at the hotel its 25 for 24 hours, cars are valet parked and placed in the underground car park. However if you don't mind leaving your vehicle on the road and are staying over a weekend there is road parking behind the hotel on the road towards the DLR. Park in the white marked bays for free over the weekends. Be aware however, ensure you park in the correct place as if you park in the vicinity of the hotel itself you will be clamped.Just a couple of minor issues we had with the hotel.Although the beds were very large, the matresses are extremely hard, fine if you like them but uncomfortable if not.Also the hotel did not take notice of our special request of a high floor room with river view, which we requested when we booked. We also checked in on-line the day before arrival and re-itterated our request to the hotel, but when we arrived we were given the 2nd floor at the back of the hotel overlooking the main road. We noticed others checking in at the same time as us who had not made any special requests being allocated the 6th floor. So were disappointed with this. We did try to change rooms but were told nothing else was available.Other than that a lovely hotel if you can get a good deal, and want to be in the vicinity of the O2 / docklands area."
132,1091,"Mar 31 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	Got a good deal via lastminute and stayed here for three nights while attending a seminar at Excel for two days. Lot of cabbies and others have not heard of it and makes sense when you say next to the Ibis. Checkin was good at 8PM when I arrived, room impressive and close to the impressive CW. Room service was good while the restaurant dinner was alright. Breakfast was excellent though a few rotating dishes would be welcome. When I have work in this area I shall return here providing the rate is good. Free internet worked perfectly. Bathroom was lovely though I wish they would provide bar soap even without the wrapper if they are so worried of the environment. Impossible to get a cab but the have a tie up with a company whose drivers really work hard and drive without seat belts to my shock as the must do at home. The staff though not the check in ones could all be refined a bit. Overall an 8 on 10."
133,1091,Mar 26 2008 	Very Nice- Once You Get INSIDE!!!	My partner and I stayed here overnight as we were having a night out in London. We got off at Blackwall as we believed it to be the nearest station to the hotel (On a map anyway!) yet it was nearly impossible to get across to the hotel.. when we did make it across we had to ask how to get into it as there are many roads and pathways around the complex..The staff were friendly and the room was very nice. Though they advertised a cd player in each room this was not the case as we only had an Ipod/ MP3 player- which neither of us had!Despite being quite far out from central London we had a wonderful stay and the breakfast was brilliant.I would love to return!
134,1091,"Mar 24 2008	Great for the 02	Booked two nights here recently as we were booked to see the Eagles at the 02. Was a little shocked on arrival at East India DLR station by the surrounding area. As we walked towards the hotel (through an area I would describe as a &quot;bit of wasteland&quot; we were a little intimidated by a car full of teenage hoodies!! The entrance to the hotel could have been nearer to the DLR. A little more than a five minute walk I think.Staff at the hotel were fantastic. we were on the third floor in a deluxe room although the view could have been better (the back of the hotel looks out onto a busy road and gas works). I am sure as it was not too busy we could have been given a front view of the Thames and the 02.We had breakfast in our room (my husband has cancer and has problems with his eating). This came on a trolley and was absolutely fantastic (everything I asked for was catered for). The staff on reception were more than helpful.The room was large, modern and clean. All the facilities were fantastic, TV, air conditioning etc. Bath, shower room were more than adequate although two robes would have been better than the one!!!Just be careful if you bring your own supplies to keep cool in the mini bar fridge (milk etc) as I found out when settling the bill, this is sensored and I was charged for Jack Daniels and other drinks just because I moved them to make room for my things. This little error took about 10 minutes to rectify when checking out!!!Best thing when standing outside on the morning before we left having a quick smoke I met the Eagles crew!! They were all staying at the same hotel!!!!Would stay again if I was going to the 02 for another concert otherwise it would be central London as the location is not the best!!"
135,1091,"Mar 24 2008	Staff who went out of their way to be helpful	Stayed 1 night when visiting the Tutankhamen exhibition at the 02. We'd booked 3 rooms as it was a family outing. The staff at reception were friendly, very welcoming and went out of their way to be helpful and find us 3 rooms close together that we could have immediate access to, even though it was early in the day. We were even given 2 free upgrades. All the rooms were excellent, with the one my husband and I stayed in being the best we have stayed in anywhere in London, possibly even in the UK. Spacious, spotless, amazing view over the river and the 02 stadium. Huge bathroom. One of the highlights of my day was relaxing in the stand-alone bath, in the dark, looking through the huge windows out on to the river!Breakfast good, hot (a rarity), in a lovely restaurant.The downside is: finding it, and the distance from the tube, especially with bags, and especially on a freezing cold day! This makes it unlikely we'd use the hotel again unless visiting the 02, it's just too far out."
136,1091,"Mar 20 2008 	Fantastic hotel great views and VERY nice staff!	Stayed in this hotel, just for one night after reading great reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel is hard to find but once you are there it is worth it. I would say that the DLR East India Docks station is the nearest although it looks like its in the middle of a building site. You can see the hotel within walking distance (tall skyscraper with 'ski slope' roof - lit up at night).The hotel is very big and modern and the rooms are immaculate with beautiful art (especially room 207!). It was so quiet and peaceful. Breakfast was waiter / buffet service and in a room overlooking the O2 dome - amazing. The staff in the breakfast room and on reception were very helpful and as beautiful as the art surounding them!No complaints whatsoever!"
137,1091,"Mar 14 2008	New and Contemporary - short hop to Canary Wharf	I stayed in room 218 for 5 nights for work in early March 2008. The room was a handicapped room, even though I did not require one. Only real difference is in the bathroom.The room itself is modern and contemporary - flat screen on the wall, iPod docking station - you can wake up to your favorite tune on your iPod. It was bright due to the large windows but there are room darkening drapes.This area just outside of Canary Wharf and is just being built up. The hotel is very new. I like it better than the Marriott at Canary Wharf and it is about 80 gbp cheaper per night as well plus the Internet is free.Bed - comfortable and firm without being back breaking.Bathroom - large - due to being handicapped bathroom. Shower only. Heated towel rack. No robes.Internet: Free wireless throughout the hotel. Good connection - able to VPN to work no problem.Security: need to put in room card in the elevator to access the guest room floors. Peepholes at both eye and wheelchair level. Chain for door. In room safe where you program your own 5 digit code.Minibar - automatic minibar - you touch it you pay for it.Closet space - good with shelves and the closet was deep enough to store my luggage. Pant press / iron in the room. Lighting - good with lots of options.Service: Check in and out was very fast and efficient. Several staff in the lobby at busy times to help people out.Food: No comment. I did not eat any meals at the hotel. I ate most of my meals at Canary Wharf or in the city with colleagues / clients.Groceries - there is a full, large grocery store in Canary Wharf called Waitrose where you can get just about anything (vegetarian / vegan foods, ready made meals etc)Fitness - they have a fitness room open until 11pm (last entry at 10pm). Free to hotel guests. Sorry to say I did not use it this trip (shame on me). Canary Wharf - just a quick trip by taxi - the hotel staff will get you a car - nice one - 5 gbp one way. From Canary Wharf I would just get a black cab and it would be between 3 and 5 gbp depending on how we hit traffic. You can walk to Canary Wharf too - it is not that far - about 10 min walkGetting there: Flew into LHR Heathrow and took the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station (15 gbp). Took a black cab from Paddington to the hotel at 10pm - 36 gbp. Since it is a newer area not all the taxis know where it is so recommend you print the directions off the hotel website. Once you are in the area past Canary Wharf you will see a tall building with a slanted room (with blue neon in the evenings). The hotel is right next door to this residential building. If you take a black cab all the way from LHR expect 120 gbp+ depending on trafficAlternate: you can call a London car service (sorry forgot the name). From Canary Wharf to LHR at 1pm on Friday it cost 37 gbp and took a litle over an hour. They charge a few sterling more to pick you up at the airport since they have to pay for parking. Phone number [--]DLR - Dockland Light Railway - you can get off at the Blackwall stop if you are coming from the city and as you come out you will see an IBIS hotel - behind it you will see a wall with some flag poles - this is the turnoff to the hotel. It is just a couple of blocks.Full directions are on their website."
138,1091,"Mar 9 2008 	Great hotel overlooking the O2	Stayed at the Radisson on 01 March 2008 while attending the Westlife concert. The hotel is in a great location if you are visiting the O2 Arena, only 2 stops on the underground/DLR.The hotel staff are very polite and helpfull. The hotel rooms are decorated to a high standard. Only 5 minute walk from East India station. The breakfast in the morning was lovely with a brilliant river view from the restaurant.If you are going to the O2 then this is the place to stay!!Had a great weekend, fantastic concert and brilliant hotel."
139,1091,"Feb 26 2008 	Loved The Radisson Providence Wharf	We stayed at the New Providence Hotel on Friday gone as part of a treat to ourselves as it was our 17th Wedding Anniversary.I must say that we had a lovely time there.The hotel staff are very helpful and bent over backwards to make you feel welcome and at home in everyway.The room was lovely, very modern with all the latest mod cons and internet access, there was even a welcome message on the TV screen when we entered the room.Because it was our anniversary the lovely lady at reception Jonavita, personally brought up a plate full of hand carved fruits and a bottle of white wine on ice. We were both very touched at such a nice gesture.The full breakfast which was brought to our room was huge and had everything you could imagine and was well worth money.The hotel has relaxation rooms and a gym which are all complimentary to guest.The hotel is less than 10 minutes away from the station and the location is great for The O2 or visiting central London which can be easily accessed by the DLR and the Tube.We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends."
140,1091,"Feb 18 2008 	good location for the 02 but not much else.	We booked 2 nights at this hotel, it was chosen due to the fairly close location to the o2 arena as we had tickets for the friday at the o2 and then we added a extra night in london to make a weekend of it.The location is good for the o2 we had a taxi to and from the o2 for roughly 15 each way, we did intend to use the public transport but the weather was cold and wet and it is a bit of a walk to &quot;Blackwall&quot; DLR station.The hotel its self is bright and modern we paid for a &quot;supeior&quot; room however i did not think we were given one as nothing in the room made it feel any different from the others, the room that we had was nice a bit small, but was well furnished with a very good bathroom which had good toileteries provided.The breakfast which was included was very good, we were lucky as every time we came down we got a table straight away, others were not so lucky and at each breakfast we saw lots of people having to wait for a free table.....Also if you book at this hotel without booking breakfast you will be hard pushed to find anything in the area to get your breakfast.The car parking was 25 for 24 hours, which was very expensive, i know its london, but other hotels do much better rates, and having to pay 50 extra is a pain when you have paid good money to stay at the hotel.The location is ok for the o2, BUT i would not use this hotel for anything else, YES it is easy to get into the centre of london on the DLR, but when we come to london again i would choose a hotel in a much better location."
141,1091,"Feb 18 2008 	Nice hotel brand new in the middle of nowhere	The hotel is brand new, rooms are nice and stylish (very unusual for London!) and the hotel is fairly priced. However the location is really in the middle of nowhere. I had a conference in Canary Wharf and still it took me 2 days to understand how I could walk to my conference, as the roads in CW are still very complicated and you have to walk through construction sites etc.Nevertheless it is close to DLR, and from there you can go anywhere. Of course, I would not recommend it if you are in London for tourism, but if you need to be in the Docklands for business it's a quite good location. Finally, one small detail, personnel was from everywhere except England, mainly young people from Eastern Europe, and they did not really know much about the city or the neighborhood of the hotel. Anyway overall a good place for businessmen who need to be based in the Docklands."
142,1091,"Feb 15 2008 	Fantastic new hotel in Docklands	I stayed in the New Providence Wharf for 3 nights mid-February after checking out of a seriously nasty hotel elsewhere in London.It is stunning!Although a little out of the way in Docklands, it's easily walkable from the main shopping and eating areas of Canary Wharf and Blackwall DLR is just round the corner.The hotel is brand new and the entrance to the lobby is breathtaking - think black slate and marble, fountains, beautiful lighting and minimalist sculpures.My company had booked me into a single room, but I was immediately upgraded to a king-size superior room, and this was beautiful; full size floor to ceiling windows, very comfortable leather king-size bed, Bang and Olufsun TV and a fantastic wet-room bathroom with shower and bath. The only thing that was a little strange was that the hanging area for clothes and the chest of drawers was in the bathroom area, but this maximised the space in the bedroom area, so can't complain!Room service was fast, good value and very tasty, and the breakfast was good quality and plentiful - the restaurant looks out over the Dome and is a hell of a view with the sun coming up over it in the morning.They've also got a state-of-the-art gym and spa, both of which I used and thoroughly enjoyed.I suspect the rate that I got of 155 a night is available mainly becasue it is a new hotel trying to build up it's reputation, and it will quickly go up from here, but if you need to be in the Docklands area, don't stay anywhere else!!"
143,1091,"Feb 10 2008 	overlook the dome	stayed here for 3 nights over new year,allocated a disabled room.funny as i,m a nurse.room was small but ok.the hotel is close to blackwall,ldr,near ibis,hotel,a short walk if you have light luggage.check in was quick.like other reviews state,there is no bar area.we booked on the hotels website and were pleased to pay 80 per room as everywhere for the time of year was expensive.breakfast was expensive around18 but had this on new years day as a treat.for those on a budget,the ibis over the road charge 5.95 for a smaller but adequate versionthis a very modern hotel with little atmoshphere,ideal for a concert at the o2, overall a good experience for our bargain price,would stay again if we could get another deal."
144,1091,"Feb 6 2008 	New Years Eve	We stayed here for 2 nights, for New Years Eve. We got a brilliant deal on Hotels.com 159 for the 2 of of us for both nights! The hotel is very modern and spotlessly clean. We had a lovely room with a large bed and TV. Marble bathroom with a shower and bath, huge mirrow in bathroom and room so you can do your makeup! The bar is very relaxing and chic, modern sofas so you can out your feet up, drinks very expensive, a cocktail is 10 and a large glass of wine was 8! Bar stayed open until 3 am New Years eve, we had late checkout until 1.30, they were supposed to charge 10 per hour an they said they couldnt charge us for the new year - excellent! A little way out of london, you do have to walk 15 mins to the tube, lots of stairs ( not good in hight heels !) . Over all would stay here again."
145,1091,"Feb 4 2008	Go There While It's Cheap!	Stayed here for 2 nights, while we were visiting friends in East London.It's very slightly out of the way at New Providence Wharf, but we walked it from Canary Wharf tube to the hotel and it only took about 15 minutes. The hotel happily took us back to Canary Wharf later on by car when we were feeling lazy - for a fiver. The hotel is right on the Thames, absolutely opposite the O2 Arena.We think this hotel's prices will start creeping up, so book in while it is so new (built September 2007). It cost us 68 per night plus VAT. Breakfast was a tenner which we booked when we got there. There was a full buffet - hot and cold.The bar, public areas, rooms, gym, everything about the place feels so modern and chic. There was every technical gadget you need in the rooms, including Bang and Olufsen TV and iPod dock - I didn't know what some of them were for! There is also a good hairdryer, iron and ironing board in each room.Bedroms are very modern, chic and minimalist. The bathroom or 'wetroom' had a full bath, and also a separate rainshower, and all Gilchrist and Soames products.Hotel guests can use the sauna, gym, steam room and showers, but we didn't because we were so busy!We didn't really see much of the staff, as there were no problems, but check in was efficient and all bar and breakfast staff were very polite.Definitely Recommended!"
146,1091,"Feb 2 2008 	awsome	after searching around for a good hotel for NYE this seemed perfect, was cheap (for london prices) but a lil far out. i think paid about 220 for 2nights for their deluxe room.hotel room wasnt ready when we got there and then again 2hours later when we went back, however the staff were pleasent about this. place isnt difficult to find its a just a lil walk, you can see the building from the station.room stunning!! get room 330 its a deluxe room but its one with a view over the river, bed nice and big and firm, great night sleep.bathroom well apointed with stand alone bath and walk in shower. tv although bang and olefson quite dissapointin as no decent channels without payin extra. room service was good, pizza and sandwiches were nice and not too badly priced. the spa area was also quite nice, small pleasent, steam room sauna and some showers with differnt nozzles, also a relaxation room, (great for a free apple) but as i said main feature of the room was the stunning views and the space in the room."
147,1091,"Feb 1 2008 	Classy 	Although quite hard to find, this modern, new hotel is a good find!I was lucky as I know the area so the best approach on Public Transport is to take the DLR to Blackwall. Take the underpass across the main road and head down the road to the right of the IBIS Hotel. You will enter the New Providence Wharf complex, the hotel is up to left (signposted).On arrival the entrance and foyer are large and sleek. Check in assistant helpful and friendly. We were on the fourth floor, the hotel is still new, and the carpets have that recently laid feeling and there is still the slight smell of paint in the corridor, but nothing unbearable.The rooms are nicely furnished, very modern and comfortable. The beds are quite hard but still new. Bathroom sleek, although the floor was not brilliant. The shower was good and heated up quickly, however the toiletries were slightly annoying. Reason being that the hotel are trying to be economical and evironmentally friendly by putting the shower gel/shampoo etc in bottles attached to the wall, and you need to press down the top to get it out. Whilst I commend their attempts to help the environment, it is a bit irritating as you only get a tiny bit at a time. In the shower cubicle was the Shower Gel and Conditioner, however the shampoo was over the other end of the bath! Because of the shape of the building, there are very few rooms with a view of the river and the 02, but if you are a leisure traveller, then you probably won't be spending a great deal of time in the room anyway.The television was good quality Bang &amp; Olufsen, but some of the features did not work, the door cam was a good idea though , but these are just minor problems, we only watched the tv late at night anyway. Another nice touch was the IPOD dock in the room.Breakfast was fresh and tasty, however not very plentiful (hot food was replenished) even though the hotel was not particularly busy. The Bar and Restaurant is nice with a view of the O2 and river, and a nice outside terrace.Overall I would stay here again if visiting the O2 or Canary Wharf. But if purely for tourist value, go for somewhere nearer the middle of town."
148,1091,"Jan 31 2008 	Excellent room and superb room housekeeping not so good	We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights to see the spice girls.We had an upgraded corner room with fantastic views over the river and O2 arena. The bathroom was particularly nice as you could sit in the freestanding tub in front of the floor to ceiling windows which were also in the bedroom. For London and in fact most hotels ithe room was above average in size.The hotel however lacked on service we waited 24hrs for someone to change the batteries in our safe;3 hrs for towels the first day after several phone calls and a visit to reception and the 2nd day the room was not cleaned at all even though we went out at 9.10am and didn't return until 3.30pm and we had put the service room light on. I had to ring again for towels so that we could get ready to go out and it took nearly 2hrs for them to arrive.When we went in the minibar we also discovered half of it missing and half empty drinks in there which wasn't pleasant. They did admit that they hadn't had the opportunity to reset the computer before we checked in and that they wouldn't be able to do it until after we checked out as there was a problem with the system.Breakfast time there was often queues for bacon eggs ect as the kitchen didn't appear to be able to refresh the food quick enough so both mornings we gave up.We got a taxi from the hotel to the 02 and back and it was 15.00 each way but I felt safer than walking down the dark underpass to Blackwall DLR which is about 10mins walk by the time you walk under the underpass ect.Gordon Ramsey has a pub called The NARROW which is a few stops away not far from Limehouse station overlooking the Thames which was really good and reasonably priced, The hotel restaurant was very quiet in the evening, but there are loads of food options in the O2 which had very long queues outside before the concert so get there early.On the whole the room was superb 5* the service was not so good 2/3* however this hotel has fantastic potential."
149,1091,"Jan 29 2008 	Superb Hotel For A Visit To The O2 Arena	I stayed at this hotel Sat 12 Jan 08 with my sister, we were going to see the Spice Girls at the O2 Arena. We arrived at East India DLR, it took us a little while to actually find the hotel (tip: find Budgens when you exit the DLR..as you are looking at it cross the road so you are the same side, walk to the right and follow the path round in a semi-circle. If you look at the high rise buildings to your left you will see Radisson Edwardian on the side of the building.Its a 5-10min walk).The hotel is very modern, the rooms are lush..especially the wet room..v nice!The beds were the comfiest that we had ever slept in. Thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast the next day, the only critisism is that the tables were not cleared very quickly. This hotel is ideal if you are going to the O2, it only took about 10mins on DLR&amp;tube. Would definatley recommend this hotel to anyone!"
150,1091,"Jan 28 2008 	What a view! Better than the Hilton!	Booked this through visitlondon.com got an amazing deal 2 nights b&amp;b 200! usually 185 per night!Went with my best mate, went to see the spice girls, brilliant location for the o2 and just a couple of tube stops from anywhere else.Booked a double room and i must say this was better than the Hilton (having stayed there over christmas). Room was a good size and spotless. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was amazing. Loved the b&amp;o sound system! Plenty of storage for clothes and shoes.Had cooked breakfast each morning which was brought to the room for no extra charge. The plate was piled with bacon, eggs, fried bread need i go on!We also ordered lasagne at 12.30 in the night no problem!The staff were all really helpful and polite didnt feel out of place, i hate snobby hotels!All in all i would definately stay here again."
151,1091,"Jan 23 2008 	Nice views	I stayed here with my husband when he was working in Canary Wharf a weekend in December. Good points: Amazing lobby, beautiful room and furniture, views across the river to the O2Bad points: A little bit of a hike to the shopping bits and restaurants, they spray loads of air fresheners on the carpet which irritated my feet really badly."
152,1091,"Jan 22 2008 	Great Hotel	I stayed here by myself when I went to see the Spice Girls at the 02. Being 32 weeks pregnant at the time, I wanted something decent and relatively near to the 02! I booked a single room, but was pleasantly surprised to find a massive double bed when I reached the room. The hotel is not too far, (30-40 mins) from Kings Cross and is relatively easy to find. The 02 is literally 10 minutes on the tube from the hotel and I would recommend it as a great base if you are going to anything at the arena. Rooms lovely, comfy and quiet, breakfast varied and fresh, check in/out pleasant.One of the best hotels I've stayed in for a while!"
153,1091,"Dec 30 2007 	brand new good comparative value	I stayed here the week the hotel opened. The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was good (for english food.) The restaurant has a patio area that overlooks the Thames and there's a nice quay down the Thames as well. The rooms are very modern, quiet, and comfortable, and do have a 110v (American) outlet. The location isn't the greatest - its a bit of a walk (close to a mile) to the Canary Wharf tube, although there are 2 close DLR stations. As of the 9/07 there were no shops or restaurants in the new providence wharf area, but it looked like they were putting some in. The hotel's breakfast buffet was over $40 US, which I wasn't going to pay every day. But the alternative was to walk to Canary Wharf or McDonalds. There are several coffee shops in the CW tube station, and we did find a small grocery by the DLR that had some pretty tasty meat pies in the morning.When I booked, the price of other comparable hotels (such as the Marriott) was around twice the price. For the quality of hotel, this was a great deal."
154,1091,"Dec 28 2007 	Great location and wonderful view over 02	Very modern hotel quite close to Canary Wharf (10 min walk). Kind of hidden in a residential complex, but if you find MacDonalds, then it's behind there!Rooms very modern, very comfortable bed, great shower.The bar is nice, breakfast good, and it is a five minute walk to the DLR.I really liked it, and would stay again!"
155,1091,"Dec 11 2007 	Modern sleek stylish hotel staff need more attention to detail	I booked this hotel about 2 months ago as a suprise weekend for my parents. There was 3 of us staying which meant I had to book a suite online and advised the hotel there would be 3 staying. Got a decent rate online direct with the hotel. Full breakfast quite pricey at 10 each although there was a great selection. The hotel is very modern, stylish and comfortable. Sofa bed in lounge area which was very comfortable. My parents loved the bedroom decor, and bathroom was fantastic. Overhead rain shower, large bath, tv in wall, excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful although i was disappointed having requested a river view room and noting with the hotel that the booking was for a surpise for my parents that on arrival they asked for my fathers credit card details even though i checked us in. Also on arrival was told they could not meet the request for a river view room as none of the suites have a river view which i felt the staff should have said on booking over the phone. Not a big deal but would have saved a bit of disappointment. Checking out my father was again presented with the bill which was annoying given the confusion on check in, as it was my treat and i didnt want him to see the bill! The suite was lovely however, with a side view of the O2 and river. As previous review states we were only given towels for 2 people, glasses and cups and we had to request more. Given the advance booking these should have already been in the room. Another nice touch was the evening of check in we were left a welcome card, handmades chocs and fresh water. DLR was not running most of the weekend which meant a good 10 min walk to Canary Wharf tube. This wasnt a problem for us although slightly uphill so too far with luggage. Buses replace the DLR running every few minutes. Blackwall and East India DLR stations are both close, Blackwall probably nearer. Compared to the price and quality of more central hotels I would stay here again if you get a similar rate of 140 per night for the suite. If your buying a day travel card anyway for the tube it wouldnt cost you extra to travel out here to the Docklands, it is a good 30-40 min though from the West End.Included in the rate is use of the gym, sauna and steam room but not the swimming pool which is 5. O2 arena is about 10 min on the DLR so makes this hotel a good choice, lots of restaurants there although if there is big concert on be prepared for long queues to eat. Recommended."
156,1091,"Dec 11 2007 	A few problems but good hotel	Originally booked 2 rooms and wanted an early check in. This wasnt available so we were &quot;upgraded&quot; to a suite. Whilst this did give us the opportunity to change and have a brush up, what we later realised was that having paid for two rooms with two bathrooms and two beds and all the amenities (tea coffee etc) we now only had half of this - one bathroom, a sofa bed and only two mugs etc for tea. Partly our own fault for accepting it, but never the less a bit of a dissapointment. We asked to be changed back, but because the hotel was full it was not possible. On the plus side, staff very helpfull and apologetic, also gave us a very good reduction for the inconvenience. Hotel very smart and also very quiet (considering it was full). Rooms and bathrooms well apointed, liked the TV in the bathroom! Great breakfast in bed -never had so much bacon! On the downside, location is a bit out of town, and as said previous reviews there is nothing to do locally (unless you want a McDonalds - no thanks). Also when we were there the DLR was on maintenance shutdown so had to get taxi to Canary Wharf station.Couldnt get the air con to work, paper that was ordered never turned up. All in all though the hotel is very smart, staff are very helpfull and efficient and the hotel is very quiet.(no banging doors, and the carpet on the corridors seems to have been designed to eliminate all noise completely!). If you are going to 02 it is a definite best choice."

1,1102,Oct 8 2007 	Great hotel for sightseeing in London	Used my Tesco Clubcard vouchers for two adjoining rooms for 2 nights. Bedroom surprising spaceious and well maintained with new LCD TV + free water in room (still and fizzy).Breakfast also really good and satisfying.If doing sightseeing bus the original tour stops outside hotel until about 10:15 otherwise you have to get a normal red bus to Marble Arch.Didn't use bar so can not comment.Recomended for family trips to London and super value if you save up your Tesco vouchers (90 in vouchers for whole weekend)
2,1102,"May 5 2007 	The Best in Town	A long weekend here with a friend was wonderful. This was one of the best hotels in London I have stayed in, A cross between a luxury hotel and a friendly 5* guest house. Our rooms were small but immaculate with all mod cons. Staff friendly. Good breakfast and snacks. Will stay again. Ideal for business or pleasure and despite location it is very quiet."
3,1102,"Jan 28 2006	Good value for money	We stayed here for 6 nights. On the negative side, the mattress was bad, but we were so exhuasted the first few nights we did not notice it. I am sure they would have gladly changed our room if we asked. On the plus side: they allowed us to check in at 8:00 a.m. after 23 hours of travel and no ability to sleep upright in a plane. I could have kissed the registration people. The staff were always wonderfu, helpful and polite. Our room was thoroughly cleaned each day. The even used a duvet cover over the comforter for cleaniness. Breakfast each day was several fresh fruits, cold cereal, pastries and a ham and cheese cold plate. The hotel was directly across from the subway station and very convenient. Certainly the pluses, combined with the cost, make this a very reasonable place to stay."
4,1102,"Jan 22 2006	Needs refurb	Have stayed before and loved it, but this time realised this place needs a refurb. pretty badly. Great location but the beds in both of the rooms we tried were in need of replacement. Lovely staff didn't make up for lack of sleep."
5,1102,Nov 27 2005 	Good value for money	I stayed there in July 2004. The room I stayed was decently sized and clean. The location is convenient with many transport choices and breakfast was of good quality. Overall I would rate this hotel definitely above average and good value for money.
6,1102,"Nov 18 2005 	Bad Hotel!!	DONT STAY HERE!Upon checking in to our very outdated rooms with very worn beds...I was distraught to find I'd lost a credit card. I asked the front desk if they'd help me call the card co. and they were extremely unhelpful.You can do much better than this.Trust me, I asked very politely and was told that the phone can't be used for guests 'personel problems'.Whatever...I'll happily spend my money anywhere else."
7,1102,"Aug 31 2005	Nothing special.	Difficult to say much exciting about this place - it's clean and well-run with friendly staff, single rooms are small and some only have showers not baths, but the 6th floor ones have (rather sparse) balconies - 604's is immense! TV is limited to terrestrial/freeview channels and a few PPV movies, and there's no proper restaurant, just a bar and cafe - although this is no real hardship as Baker Street is only a few yards away.The hotel is pretty much next door to Marylebone station so no problems with tube or taxis. A perfectly adequate place for a short stay in London.Seems to accept bookings at about 35/night from priceline, at that price I'd say it's good value, but I wouldn't pay the rack rates for it!"
8,1102,"Jun 16 2005	Nice hotel but needs air conditioning	An okay hotel - with pros and cons. Cons, first: Upon checkin, we were given rooms on the first floor, and while the temperature outside was only in the 60's, the room was unbearibly hot and had no air conditioning. We opened the windows, but the street noise was terrible. They were very nice about it, and moved us up to the 4th floor. The temperature was a little better, but we still had to keep the windows open all night, and as a result, some nights, the street noise and partiers kept us awake. I can't imaging staying here in July-August when it gets truly hot outside. Also, the second room had a bed with a broken box spring. Again, we were moved, and all was well after that. Rooms were small, but not overly so.Pros: Great location for the Tube and Marylebone train station - we took the train from there to Warwick. Great staff - Anthony, the bellman was particularly helpful and nice. We had continental breakfast included with our room, and that was very good, as well, with fresh fruit, cereal, breads, sweets, ham, cheese, etc. Easy to fill up enough to last to dinner.I would stay here again if the price was right, just not in the summer months."
9,1102,"May 14 2005	good overall	My husband and I stayed there for a week in March. Our first room (130, I think) was the pits-- very hot (even in winter), toilet didn't work, TV broken, window didn't open/close properly so we could hear the drunken partygoes below for hours, and *their* hairdryer sparked when I tried to use it, burning my clothes and me. It would've been almost funny if I weren't so jetlagged. When the guy came to check the toilet, he had an attitude and tried to tell me it was fine-- then proceeded to ram the handle for about 20 minutes until it was worse than before. We had to stay in that room the first night (had to use the bar's toilet), and when we went down in the morning to switch rooms, the people in front of us in line at the desk had been robbed from the 6th floor. Not off to a good start.BUT, we were changed to a much better room for the rest of our vacation. Very comfortable, bigger, everything worked, quieter, and clean. We carried our valuables around with us all week instead of leaving them in the room, but that was probably not necessary. Staff were very personable, breakfast was great (good for vegetarians), and the location can't be beat. Overall, I'd go back, but to avoid the noise would request a room not on the 1st floor and not right over the train station entrance."
10,1102,"Apr 11 2005	Ramada Marylebone is a great find	Got a good deal through Brian Moore. Nice, clean rooms, Small, but manageable. Excellent location, very good continental breakfast included in price of room. Staff courteous and helpful.Advice: Ask for a room off the street. Pub closes at 2, and the partying starts on the sidewalk for an hour or so."
11,1102,"Mar 17 2005	hm	My first room was a little grotty - even as a smoker I was appaulled at how the room was stinking. Very sparse and very compact. When going to bed noticed the quilt was wet so I called housekeeping who promptly moved me to a better decorated but just as sparse room. This one had a over flow pipe running from the toilet to the shower cubicle which flowed! when the cistern was full. Luckly I have a pond at home so I managed the first night, but by the sceond it was driving me mad so. This hotel is close to the tube station which is why I took it, nearly 3 for a small bottle of becks I did not hang out in the bar. Breakfast was good and service was excellent in the dinning room. So a bit of a mixed bag. I am returning puely because the price was good and the location meets my needs."
12,1102,"Mar 7 2005	Pleasantly surprised	I stayed here for 5 nights in Feb. 2005. The hotel is centrally located -- just across the street from the underground on the Bakerloo line which is very convenient to the theatre district. The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. The rooms were small, but typical of London hotels. The bathroom had lots of hot water, and plenty of clean fluffy linens. The neighborhood was safe to walk around in late at night. After midnight, the desk clerk locked the front door, but I rang the doorbell and they were right there. The TV carried the 5 major London stations -- so there was usually something to watch all the time, without resorting to pay tv.I found the hotel extremely clean and safe. I stayed here as part of American Airlines vacation package and was very pleased. Would stay here again."
13,1102,"Jan 3 2005	Everything was fine	Centrally located. Clean rooms, maybe non-smoking ones are better. Very good english and continental breakfasts. Everyone was very kind. In my opinion it was excellent!"
14,1102,"Jul 15 2004	Centerally Located	My family and I stays at the Ramada Jarvis Marylebone for 6 nights. The hotel, b/rooms, b/room was small, but everyone was very frendly and helpful, breakfast in the mornings was great, great service and choises.Was a little disapointed with the type of charges on the telephone each time you pick the phone and attemp to make a call with a calling card they charge you a pound..........I also have to asked for my linens to be change after 3 days.Overall I would return, would not used phone and would check for clean towels and linens."
15,1102,"Jul 8 2004	Convenient Home Away From Home	My husband and I spent 6 nights here in March and really enjoyed it. Having stayed at other London hotels of similar cost on previous visits, we found this one to have larger rooms, be more comfortably appointed, and EXTREMELY convenient to most everywhere in London via the Marylebone tube stop (and train station) which is nearly adjacent to the hotel. The hotel is very close to several good restaurants, a couple of pharmacies, some food stores and just a couple of blocks from Baker St. and the Baker St. tube stop. We even included Abbey Rd. studios/crossing in one of our morning 45 minute round trip walks. It's quite close to Regent's Park, a short stroll from the canals and just a pleasant walk to the Wallace Collection Gallery (try their outstanding cafe for a leisurely, splurgey lunch!).We found the food options in the Marylebone station to be a great, cheap alternative for lunches/snacks than more costly, &quot;sit down&quot; places. The staff in the hotel were very courteous and friendly and although the hotel bar is really nothing to write home about, one evening we were tired and opted to eat at the hotel rather than going out - fully expecting &quot;hotel food,&quot; and were pleasantly shocked to have one of the BEST meals of our whole trip at the Jarvis Marylebone Ramada! The breakfast buffet was quite good and a free newspaper was provided each morning. WE'll definitely stay at this hotel again."
16,1102,"Jul 7 2004	Adequate Hotel Good Location	I visited London last month for the first time and stayed at the Ramada. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room was the lack of A/C. The room was stuffy and quite hot, but when we ventured outdoors we found the temperature to be at least 10 degrees cooler. The rooms themselves were small and the decor was a bit worn. The bathroom also looked like it could use a makeover, the tub was chipped as was the tile in various locations. One thing I did like was the hotel's proximity to the Marylebone station - making it a good starting point to venture almost anywhere in London."
17,1102,"Jun 9 2004	Good value but some things to think about.	I just returned from a vacation in London, where I spent 6 nights at this hotel. It was very nice, the location extremely convenient, but there were some issues I think that are worth noting.DECOR/CLEANLINESS: Beautifully decorated lobby, single rooms extremely small but nicely set up, very clean, very good maid service.LOCATION: Very convenient, right next to the subway station, where there are little stores where you can easily find sandwiches, salads, fruit, snacks to help ease the bite of the weak dollar and supplement restaurant meals.CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: A cut above the rest I think. Offered salami/cheese plate, 3 different breads, 3 different fruits, 3 different yoghurts, cereals, pastries, 3 different juices, coffe/tea and more. Fast, efficient service, newspapers provided, really helped me out by providing a solid first meal of the day. As a vegetarian, I got on very well here.ISSUES:Maintenance: The first room I got, I settled in, used the restroom and then found the toilet was broken and did not flush. I called the desk and they sent housekeeping right up and she summoned maintenance. While I was waiting, I laid down on the bed only to find that on this small single bed, everyone slept on the same side and there was a definite tilt to the mattress. I requested a room change and got one without problem. The second room I got the toilet and mattress were fine so I unpacked and took a shower. The shower did not drain and left 2&quot; inches of water. Housekeeping came right up and as maintenance had gone for the day by this time, the housekeeping manager proceeded to pump the drain out. The service and response was excellent but these things should not have happened. How could the toilet and shower have been cleaned and someone not have known they didn't work?STAFF:Seem like mostly French speaking foreign students. Very helpful and eager to please.SECURITY: NONEXISTANT! I had several people call me and no one at the front desk picked up. Similarly, I called the front desk several times and noone picked up. I had guests come to the hotel and walk right up to my room unchallenged. One set of guests said they didn't see anyone in the lobby at all. One night I came home, walked through the lobby, up to my room and didn't see a single staff person. While there often staff members present during the week I was here, I frequently encountered a complete lack of security.OVERALL:A nice, clean hotel, with friendly staff, eager to please. However, because of the security issues, I would try another hotel next time. It's a shame -- this is a very convenient and nicely attired place but in a major city in this day and age, the fact that the front desk is left unattended, no matter for how short a time, is perplexing and disturbing."
18,1102,"May 27 2004	Fab for the money!	Stayed here for 3 nights 2 years ago. Good hotel, inexpensie and close to everything. The shower was crap (typical english plumbing) and the room looked a bit old but overall clean. Staff were nice enough. Mostly foreign students who worked there I think. The breakfast was cold for the 3 mornings we were there. Looked like it was sitting out in the kitchen for an hour or two - but overall edible. Maybe worth just going to the M&amp;S up the street in Marylebone station for a quick breakie - cheaper and yummier! Overall, I would stay there again. Safe area and easy to get around to other of London's attractions."
19,1102,"Apr 12 2004	Cozy Convenient Friendly	My wife and I were booked into this attractive hotel as part of a Virgin Atlantic Vacations Package. From the onset, the staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. Our room, small but adequate, faced the Marylebone Station. During the several days we stayed there, we had above average maid service which provided a clean, comfortable and quiet environment. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate, staffed by friendly efficient people. We highly recommend this establishment."
20,1102,Apr 2 2004	Jarvis Maryleborne a great hotel	I've just returned from a trip to London. We stayed at the Jarvis Maryleborne Ramada Hotel and found it to be a good value. It is well located in a nice neighborhood. The breakfast buffet is delicious and the rooms are clean (but small). The staff were also very helpful.
21,1102,"Mar 14 2004	ramada nights	we stayed in london on a weekend break and was booked to the ramada jarvis as part of the package.firstly it is very convenient to find.pop your head out of marylebone station,look right and it stares you in the face. we were in room 406 (4th floor)not a problem with the lifts(2 in total) although one was admittedly out of order when we were there. the room was small but pleasant enough ,looking out toward the station.traffic was busy at times and the sound of tooting horns and emergency vehicles was a little offputting but we soon got used to it.after all it is london. facility's were the norm and basic.dont' be fooled by promises of sky telly. you have to pay for it. not that we were in long enough to watch anything. breakfasts were very good and service by the staff first class.one drawback we found was that they didn't smile much and conversation was unbecoming to most of them,the exception being the girls we encountered on the front desk who were very polite and extremely helpful.the bar is a little dingy and we didn't feel that we could drink in that atmosphere,room for some improvement there.one thing i noticed was being a big lad , the toilet felt a bit low and uncomfortable(sorry but you want the good and the bad) otherwise very clean. all in all though we found our stay at the ramada a pleasant one and would visit this hotel again."
22,1102,Jan 28 2004	Loved it!	 I stayed at the Ramada Jarvis Marylebone in April of 2003. The rooms are very small. But you get a nice warm felling. It almost fill like a B&amp;B. Room service was wonderful. Very good choice for a family hotel or small traveler. I well most likely stay at the Ramada Jarvis Marylebone again.
23,1102,"Jan 20 2004	Clean conveniently located good service.	My mother and I stayed here a week at New Year's. The hotel is conveniently located steps from the Marylebone Tube Station and 4 blocks from the Baker Street Tube Station. Regent's Park, Sherlock Holmes Museum and Madame Tussaud's are a few blocks away. Through the Ramada website, got a fantastic winter special B &amp; B rate of 49 pounds/night including full English Breakfast . (Also available: Buffet continental breakfast offering fruit, juice, coffee, tea, pastries, cereal, yogurt, cold meats and cheese.) If B &amp; B rate not available, a small cafe across the street offers breakfast for 3-4 pounds and the tube station has a few food stalls and a small Marks &amp; Spencer outlet. Room was on a no-smoking floor, clean and nicely furnished. No dresser so we had to dress out of our suitcases. Television, hair dryer, ironing board, iron and trouser press, tea and coffee tray provided. Linens changed daily and room vacuumed, as well. Bathroom with tub was a bit small with low ceiling, making taking a shower a tight squeeze for a tall person. Bath towels were thick and over-sized. Staff were friendly and helpful in arranging tours and giving travel advice. The neighborhood is safe and includes a post office, many restaurants and pubs and banking ATM's. Buses leaving from the Marylebone station offer another option to all the tourist spots."

1,1109,Nov 23 2009 	85GBP Bought Me A Closet	I stayed 2 nights in this hotel. My room was literally like a closet. There was no room to set my suitcase down!The staff were not friendly except when it came time to take my money.The room had a bedspread that had burn marks on it. Everything about it was run-down and dirty.I saw a lot of other hotels on the same street that would be worth paying a bit extra for to be comfortable.I won't return.
2,1109,"Nov 12 2009 	Fantastic value for money	Plus points: extremely friendly staff, incredibly quiet room at the rear of the hotel, excellent Full English Breakfast with premium quality bacon, great central location 3 mins walk from the Tube.Minus points: tiny single room, although perfectly adequate for me for a short stay, larger people may have difficulty moving around in the very small bathroom.Conclusion: fantastic value for money. I will stay again."
3,1109,Sep 2 2009 	Great Hotel--convenient location to central London	The Regency staff are marvelous--Victor the owner helped me find my work locations on his map. Food was good. Room was perfect. I'm in the entertainment field and the Hotel is walking distance to most of the main studios in Soho and W1. Good for tourists too as it's right up the street from the British museum. I highly recommend it!
4,1109,"Jul 29 2009 	Okay but have found better value on same street	The Regency House Hotel is located near Goodge Street station. It is an excellent location with no doubt. The hotel happens to be on a street of B&amp;Bs. I know there are cheaper places to stay on Gower Street, we actually tried to book the Ridgemount beforehand but they were booked out (70 a night as opposed to 95 for the Regency House). Note: The Jesmond Hotel a few doors down is a much nicer place and is 90 a night, cheaper and better. Check them out.I would suggest to look at all the hotels in Gower Street before you make your decision. You can have continental or English breakfast. If you wish they will tailor the breakfast to your needs (less/more eggs, bacon, no beans etc).Bring toiletries of course!Nice restaurants nearby: Navarro (spanish tapas), Paradiso (lovely little Italian place) Both within walking distance. Book for Navarro it tends to get booked up.There was no internet access, no common room. The decor was better than the Jesmond and the room seemed a little bigger, but I still think the Jesmond tops here easily. It's adequate if everywhere else is booked, which is what happened to us (we spent two nights at the Jesmond and one here), but keep in mind you can get somewhere just as nice or nicer for a lower price!"
5,1109,"Jul 4 2009 	friendly clean tidy and nothing to much trouble	when we first entered the hotel were greeted with a friendly smiling helpful young lady who went out of her way to help us. the rooms were spacious, nicely decorated , .very clean and comfortable. the location suited us perfectly - short taxi ride to covent garden. having read the three previous reports, i wonder what type of hotel these people were expecting - i have travelled extensively in europe and usa and found this on above par of anything in this band of hotel. this is central london so traffic noise can be a bit loud if. window open."
6,1109,"Jun 29 2009 	You get what you pay for...	I feel bad writing this, as the owner was so nice (or I'd have given a score of only 1 for location), but what a hole. I often read reviews and think people are very harsh in what they expect but although this was cheapish (by London standards, certainly not compared to the rest of the UK) and the location was good that's about all to recommend it. The room was tiny, old-fashioned and tired (looked nothing like the advertised photos), the whole house stinks of frying oil, all day and night. And this gets worse with breakfast, where you will have to sit in the small dining room at a table with other guests you don't know. The breakfast was okay but consisted of cheap ingredients and the smell of fat actually made me heave. I am not a picky person at all but I would rather spend more more money and stay elsewhere. Unless you are a backpacker or skint student (although my student room was nicer than this many times over), don't waste your money on this place."
7,1109,"Jun 15 2009 	Disgusting Noisy Horrible: Ruined the first week of our honeymoon.	This hotel is on a major one way street funneling night time deliveries, cops, and party going traffic into Leicest Square area. Even with both windows closed, we couldn't sleep with the racing traffic zooming down Gower St. After 2 sleepless nights, we resorted to sleeping pills and ear plugs.Walls were super thin....a German family next door never controlled their kids banging around until 1AM....and upstairs occupants stomped around until about 2AM.We booked a double room, but upon arrival were given a single...manager didn't tell us until we talked to them the next day...that might explain why the room was ridiculously small. Room had no air flow.Also, you wake up every moring with the smell of grease permeating your room from 3 floors down where the kitchen is frying up the &quot;English Breakfast&quot;....but no blood sausage as shown on the website.Bathroom was horrendously small and diry. Toilet didn't function properly, needed anti anxiety drugs just to get in the grimy shower to rinse off all the street dust in the room if you left the window cracked to let out the heat.Website makes this look like a gorgeous and genteel retreat...in fact it is a smelly, rundown, loud, cheap dump. Ruined the first week of our honeymoon."
8,1109,May 24 2009 	Book somewhere else	This is the only hotel I have ever walked out of. It was filthy. There was a closet in the room with a broken door and a bag of half used towels spilling out. The bathroom was tiny and dirty. The floor was disgusting. The room was hot and tiny and noisy and the lock on the door was rickety and unreliable. It had nothing to recommend it. Service was terrible. We walked out. It was your classic flea bag with the ambience of a rent by the hour flea bag.
9,1109,"Apr 25 2009 	Perfect location super friendly staff!	I stayed here with my 2 teenage children for 10 days in April. The staff are so friendly (a lovely couple who are in charge in the mornings, and a young woman in the afternoon and evenings), we felt welcome as soon as we arrived and were given bottled water to take up to our room. I've read the other reviews, and a number of people complain about the small size of the rooms and bathrooms...yes, they are snug, and the bathrooms are tiny, but this is also typical of this type of building (a renovated 200 year old row house), as well as similar to other rooms in which I've stayed in Europe. It's not a Marriot Hotel with huge rooms, but I'd imagine to get that in London you'd have to rob a bank or stay near the airport. Re: the water pressure: as far as I could tell, the toilets simply work differently in London, we found wherever we went during the day that they just don't seem to &quot;flush,&quot; so that appears to be a London-wide issue. And really, we were in London to sightsee, not to hang out in the room. We had a double and a single bed in our room, as well as a desk and a wardrobe and three night tables, so really, all the room we needed for sleeping and watching a bit of TV later in the evening. Breakfast gets a bit crowded by 8:30 (ends at 9am) so we tried to get downstairs by 8:00-8:15. You can get the full English breakfast, which we did once, but mainly we just had an egg and toast. You can ask for whatever combination you like. Fill up on toast, and you won't need lunch til early afternoon! Cross to the other side of Gower St. and go south a block to the bus stop and you can catch the #24 to Pimlico, which will stop at many points of interest (Cambridge Circus--West End musicals, and Trafalgar Square among others.) Walk west a couple of blocks to Tottenham Court Rd. to the Goodge St. tube station (The number #24 bus north will drop you off here, as Gower St. is one way heading south.) Pizza Express saved our life, excellent, inexpensive wood-oven pizzas, there's one on Coptic St. just south of the British Museum. This hotel was a perfect central location for all of the sightseeing we wanted to do, and is within easy walking distance of the British Museum and Soho. They also supply a plug adapter and watt converter, as well as a blowdryer (found them in the desk drawer.) We had a room on the garden side, but don't imagine it was all birds chirping: this is central London, and Gower St. is a major road, and even the garden side has a road beyond it that seems to be a late night shortcut, so there was traffic noise all night, much like any big city, so if you're a light sleeper, consider earplugs. I loved the age and history of the building, but it's not a modern cement walled hotel, meaning you can hear your neighbours, so we tried to keep the TV down after 10pm. It is an old house, after all, not a new hotel, which is part of its charm. We miss this hotel and London already!"
10,1109,"Mar 26 2009 	Entertaining staff good value for money	We stayed in this hotel in Sept 2008 and found it a rather nice place of stay, our room ( facing Gower St on the first floor ) was spacious and comfortable,Incidently our parents were staying a few doors down in the Ridgemount and their room was tiny compared with ours. There is a great italian restauant around the corner and many other pubs and restaurants with in easy reach if you dont want to wander far.Now for the staff. They are mostly eastern european ( as you would expect ) and the young man who checked us in was lovely and very helpful.When we ventured down into the basement for breakfast we were served by a sucsession of nice young ladies who were dressed up for a night on the town instead of waitressing. They were pleasant and bought some nice cooked breakfast ( bacon too salty ) but they brightened up our morning !!!!!The owner of the establishment was a large cheerful Polish man that made us laugh.His sense of humour was a little strange at times and he was a real character. Were hoping to return to the Regency soon look forward to the quirkiness of the place."
11,1109,"Nov 6 2008 	Very small	I stayed at this property for 2 nights, i made the mistake of booking a single room. The room was tiny, i could just about touch both walls, and the window was obscured by a tree therefore very dark and small. The bathroom was tiny. The cleanliness etc was very good, however the room was very small."
12,1109,"Oct 11 2008 	Best B/B hotel in London	What an excellent B/B hotel. I have stayed here since my first visit to London in 1988...and have always returned here. The staff is one of the best ever...and the hotel is a really jewel: close to everything in London. Since theatre and opera are my main aspects of the trip, the hotel is ideally situated: close to the tube or walking...and with Tesco's and M&amp; S closeby, it was easy to get a snack without going out for every meal. A great deal...and HIGHY RECOMMENDED."
13,1109,"Jul 27 2008 	Best Location in London	This hotel is 5 minutes walk to British Museum, next to many similar hotels. We had a large family room on the ground level, that was probably a living room once upon a time. Big enough for a couple with three kids. Despite the heavy traffic on the road we were facing, it still felt like a quiet residntial area. Easy walk to some lovely squares, and busy Russel Square where many shops are. Friendly staff. I enjoyed the stay very much."
14,1109,Apr 1 2008 	Nice hotel in a very good location	We stayed at the Regency House Hotel for three nights in March and we had a pleasant stay. The hotel is in a very good location. There are three underground stations and several buses within easy walking distance. You can easily walk to Oxford street and to many of the theatres. We walked to Covent Garden and on one day we even walked to the London Eye.The owners are friendly in an unobtrusive way. We checked in at about 12 pm and when we were leaving after checkout they offered that we could leave our bags at the hotel until we had to get to the airport in the afternoon. Our room was at the front of the building on the top floor. The only time we heared other guests was when the people in the room next door got up to leave very early in the morning on one day. There was hardly any noise from the traffic on Gower Street. The room was quite nice and clean. It was more spacious than we had expected. The bed was large and very comfortable. Breakfast was good and plenty. We paid 95  per night for a double room. Weve stayed at equally nice b&amp;bs in other parts of Britain for slightly more than half that price. But considering that London is much more expensive and that we stayed in a comfortable room in a nice area in a very central location I think its worth the price.
15,1109,"Mar 29 2008 	great	great place to stay, very friendly"
16,1109,"Mar 10 2008 	Basic clean tired round the edges but friendly.	We booked this hotel for an overnight stay and paid full rack rate of 95 due to the time of year (Valentines weekend). However, we chose it for the location, which was great for the West End and shopping. There was traffic noise from the road but that's hard to avoid in central London.The bed was lovely and comfy and the bathroom had been recently partially updated despite being very compact. The bedroom itself was small too but that's often the case in London.The decor was a bit shabby and the fixtures a bit worn and outdated eg old TV with missing remote, mismatched bedside lamps, unfashionable wardrobe but it was clean, comfy and warm (important in February!). I got the impression that the hotel was constantly busy and they just didn't get a chance to update the rooms and almost didn't see a need to if they are that busy which is fair enough I suppose.However, this sounds very negative and the hotel was really very friendly and helpful from when we first arrived to when we left. Breakfast was yummy too and if you opted for the continental breakfast, it looked like you actually got a really good option for once with nice yoghurts and a good selection of cheeses considering the hotel only has a few rooms. Good coffee too. The breakfast room could have been improved with tablecloths on the lovely formica tables and some newer crockery because it really was a throwback to the 70's but as I said before, I can't fault the quality, just the decor!This hotel is good for a stopover for one or maybe two nights but I probably wouldn't want to stay any longer than that as it would be a bit too small."
17,1109,Feb 1 2008	Pleasantl Suprised	found this hotel in a quieter location of central london a pleasant surprise. staff were VERY helpful. room was clean and kept tidy during our 4 day stay. We will certainly be back again and would recomend this to anyone
18,1109,"Dec 2 2007 	Great Location helpful staff if you ask	I called this property in a last-minute panic and the woman who answered was helpful in arranging our weekend stay. It was a short walk from Euston Tube station, and very short walk to the British Museum, our favorite. The first day, we needed some first aid supplies, and when asked where to find a chemist, the staff was again helpful and friendly. They may not make the first move, but are very nice if you need anything. Postives include the spacious double and large, firm bed on the top floor, decent noise reduction (we faced the street but double-glazing kept noise down), satisfactory breakfast incl. that tasty marmalade. Negatives would have to be the cleanliness level, the bathroom was adequately clean but a bit grimy, the bedroom floor seems never vaccuumed, and the dust and dinginess are a little off-putting. Most important to me is to be able to sleep, and that we were, comfortable and content. I should add that I expected worse from the bathroom, given reviews here, but ours was just spacious enough."
19,1109,"Jul 20 2007 	The smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in my life	Stayed for 1 night in July. Wanted to book tried and tested excellent Ridgemount Hotel nearby but it was fully booked. So I had to give Regency House a chance. The room was incredibly small. TV did not work properly. Room being on the growund floor, right at the staircase, I could hear all traffic up and down the stairs all through the night. In the morning I was awaken by the stench of bacon rashers being prepared in the kitchen below. Breakfast was frugal compared to other establishments on Gower Street (no cornflakes, like at Ridgemount Hotel, which, by the way, I think is the best budget option in the area). All in all, too expensive for the service. Woun't stay there again."
20,1109,"Jun 23 2007 	so-so	I stayed in a single room. The plus points - excellent location. Goodprice. Room facing garden at back quiet. minus points - I can accept the room being small - this being central London but smallest showercubicle I have been in (I am a 6 footer) was a big let down. Shower itself a letdown, bad water pressure. Whilst there, another guest who came in for breakfast was told - &quot;we are out of toast , I'll have some for you tomorrow&quot;! I was earnestly recommended to pay for the entire stay upfront. I didn't object but this was no exactly welcoming is it? Room was clean but not spotless - there was dust anddirt in obvious places."
21,1109,"May 21 2007 	Good but not excellent	We stayed here for 3 nights.Price/qualitay this hotel is OK.Altough to me its a B&amp;B and not a hotel.There is no reception.Service is good but not that friendly as many say in reviews.We had one of the noisy rooms on the street side, at 115 pound a night (triple room with one big bed and one small).Its hard to find cheaper in this part of town, but since its an old building and noisy the price is correct to me. Wouldn't give more for this kind of hotel. Bathroom very small.Breakfast excellent. Check out is very early, but so is check in so no complaints about that.Its a place i keep in mind, for a city trip you are not that much in your room, but an excellent sleep due to the noisy street is not evident at all."
22,1109,"Apr 6 2007	Fantastic stay	This was a gem of a find - it was in the heart of london, only 10 minutes walk from Euston station. I got the double room at the top which had a lovely clean bathroom. The staff are very friendly and helpful and it has a lovely homey feel to it. A bargain"
23,1109,"Mar 26 2007 	Standard 2 star hotel very central	This little hotel is 5 minutes far from the Goodge street Station and 10 minutes far from Tottenham Court Road station. We got a triple room which was big and bright, there was a king bed and a single bed. The bathroom is incredibly small but has a good shower and in general it is clean (even if a bit worn down).The carpet and sheets were clean, there was a little dust all over the furniture, but more than acceptable. From our windows we could see the nice garden of the hotel, we suggest to ask for a room facing the back side of the Hotel (as our was) as Goodge street is a main road quite noisy. The overall feeling you have in the hotel is of a quite old B&amp;B, a little drab maybe, but which has all the comforts you can ask for in a short stay in town.(for 99 pounds per night in triple) The breakfast was super, the english breakfast was well cooked but they also had good marmalades, jams and scones. The staff was really friendly and helping. The hotel does not have a reception desk, they have a small office in the lower floor.If you need to have dinner with not a big budget at Centre Point (Tottenham Court Road) there are some fast foods. We ate a good pizza meal at Pizza Hut."
24,1109,"Feb 27 2007 	A weekend away	We stayed at the hotel because we were going to see a show in London. It was a nice hotel but the only problem was that 2 of the 4 non smoking rooms booked smelt extremely badly of smoke. Apart from this the breakfast was good, staff friendly (especially trying to book us a taxi). We would definitely go back to this hotel in the future."
25,1109,Jan 28 2007 	Great Value	We decided to stop at Regency House mainly due to its location and ease of access into the Theatre area of London. Easily reached on foot from Euston station we found the triple room we had booked to be roomy and clean. We were greeted on day one by friendly staff and found that this service remained throughout our 4 day stay. Breakfast was of a home made standard and was one of the best english breakfasts we have had. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good value for their money wishing to stop within walking distance of the theatre area.
26,1109,"Dec 15 2006 	central near tube and bus clean	i reccomend this hotel for the following point:-near tube line 300 metres;-in front of the bus stop;-near British museum and a few minutes walk from the commercial Oxford Street;-clean room;-very good english or normal breakfast (included on the price of your stay).The bathroom is small in the triple room, but the shower is good.I enjoy very much to stay here."
27,1109,"Dec 7 2006	Highly Recommended	We stayed for a week at the Regency House in the end of November 2006. We were travelling in three, but upon our request for a spacious room we were very kindly allowed a room on the ground floor having 1 double bed and three single beds with two windows overlooking Gower Street. We were very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room (compared to other rooms we have had in London hotels in previous visits). The bathroom was not smaller than we expected and was very clean. Plenty of clean towels were supplied daily. The smell of breakfast wafted up to the room every morning, but this only served to whet our appetites. The room was well-equipped and has a wireless internet facilitiy. The hotel is situated in a very nice area (see street photo included with this review) and the location is excellent and central.The English breakfast was lavish as promised by the photo on the hotel site. Apart from the egg, bacon, beans, tomato, mushroom &amp; sausage it also includes plenty of toast, juices, tea/coffee, jams, marmalade and a variety of cheeses.Staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to solve a problem we had with our laptop which could not connect to their wireless internet (presumably due to some settings on our laptop because theirs was working fine), and they did not give up until the problem was solved, calling our room more than once to check that everything was fine. They were also very helpful in suggesting sites we could visit during our stay and useful tips.The reception we had was very warm and we were made to feel part of the family. We look forward to staying in this hotel again in our future visits to London!"
28,1109,"Nov 21 2006 	Pleasant stayexcept for the street noise	My husband and I stayed at the Regency House for one night, on Sept. 25, 2006. Although I'd made the reservation many months in advance and specified that I wanted a room on the garden side for quietness, we've been told upon arrival that there was a problem with the booked room. The lady at the front desk couldn't tell us exactly what the &quot;problem&quot; was and we had to accept a room on the street side. The weather was very hot for September and we had to keep the window open all night long, which was quite disturbing since Gower St. is a very noisy street. However, the room was comfortable and the bathroom - the smallest I've ever seen - was spotless clean. The breakfast was excellent too. At time of check out, the owner was there. He explained us why we the garden side room was unavailable. He appologised for the inconvenience and offered us a 10 Sterling Pounds reduction, to our satisfaction. Overall, a bad start turned into a good experience. We're planning to come back again, but only if garden side rooms are guaranteed available."
29,1109,"Nov 19 2006 	Prime Location - Good Room	Our room was clean, comfortable &amp; well maintained. The King size bed was comfortable - breakfast was freshly prepared &amp; great. The location is prime! Around the block from the Tube &amp; the night bus ran every 10 - 15 minutes all night long! The bathroom was small but clean with PLENTY of hot water. London is brutally expensive &amp; I was not thrilled to pay $175 per night. But $175 appeared to be on the low end of the pricing scale for the neighborhood. No complaints here!"
30,1109,"Sep 1 2006 	Adequate comfort in a Great Location	When my husband and I arrived at the Regency House, I was pleased because the website actually does not accurately represent how pleasant the property is. The proprietor and staff were initially unfriendly, but with a little conversation and politeness from us became very warm and helpful. We were pleased with our room, which, while small of course, was more than adequate, with an enormous window overlooking the garden, a lovely original (non-working) fireplace, and very high ceilings. The impeccably clean bathroom had all the necessary amenities and good water pressure, but make no mistake, it is absolutely tiny in size. This was not a problem for us but to be honest, someone who is severely overweight might have a great deal of difficulty manoevring around the bathroom. The bed itself was not very comfortable, but other furniture provided (desk, chairs) was much nicer. The fittings and furniture are slightly outdated but are still tasteful. Breakfast was a very pleasant surprise, a full english breakfast cooked fresh, abundant toast and coffee or tea, and high quality orange juice. We were not expecting such a good breakfast from a hotel of this price range. Also a pleasant surprise was that the surly-looking staff were in fact very helpful and accommodating at all times. The location, obviously, is excellent, the hotel being situated a short walk from several tube stations, very near the British Museum and the Goodge St shops and restaurants. Easy walk to many popular destinations and short tube ride to anywhere in central London. Tottenham Court Rd is noisy both day and night but for anyone who is used to city living this will not be bothersome. My only true complaint about this hotel is that they allow smoking in the rooms, and there was a constant smell of smoke wafting about. This was not hugely problematic but I did find it unpleasant. Anyone who is allergic or severely averse to cigarette smoke MUST NOT stay here. However, on the whole, I recommend this hotel to anyone who requires a decent room in a good location in London and who does not require luxurious accomodations."
31,1109,"Jul 6 2006	Great price for a great location	My wife is a graduate student who needs to travel to London regularly for meetings at the university. Sometimes she goes on her own, sometimes I accompany her. Since location, convenience, safety, cleaniness are very important to her, on my first visit to London I walked up Gower Street to vist the many B&amp;Bs there. I took notes after peeking into the rooms, checking out the bathrooms, talking to the staff, etc. Of the dozen or so B&amp;Bs there, I knew Regency House would be it. Subsequently everytime she went I would try to book Regency House for her, and she would come back with compliments. Finally last month I went to London with her and sampled it first hand. For BP85 we were put into a large room with 3 beds on the ground floor facing Gower Street. The noise level was tolerable, but given the large size of the room it was perfectly acceptable (when she went on her own, her single-ensuite faced the backyard and cost only BP50). The bathroom was small, as expected, but the overall condition was clean/decent. The breakfast was excellent. I was really hungry one morning but I still couldn't finish all the toast, jam, cheese, eggs, bacon, sausages... that were offered. Last but not least, the staff was really helpful, from booking a car for us to catch the 6.00 a.m. flight out of Heathrow, to letting us check our bags at the office, and on one occasion even allowing early check-in so we could take a nice shower/nap before a hectic day in London. Regency House is definitely a place I will recommend."
32,1109,"Feb 7 2006	Needs an update but it's perfect	Stayed there for a weekend early february though we made a booking on the Cavendish (next door). As the Cavendish is carrying on major works, they kindly realocate us at the Regency House.Well, that was definitively a good idea as this hotel has an excellent price-quality rate. The staff is so kindly and the rooms are good in size, but they need an update. The bathroom was clean and was one of the smallest I've ever seen but, at least, we were no sleeping nor living in there, so it was not important for us.The breakfast is also very good. Complete and tasty.About the location of the hotel, just have to say that has a good situation, near many attractions and Goodge Street underground station (5 min. walk).Surely we'll come again."
33,1109,"Feb 6 2006	Average budget hotel	We have stayed in the Regency House Hotel in January 2006. We had a double room on the first floor for 65 Pounds per night. The room was of average size (for Europeans, Americans will find it much too small). The room was clean, the bathroom small but also quite clean. The breakfast is served in the basement. You can choose from English Breakfast (ham, eggs, tomatoes, beans) or cereals. Also served is toast, juice, tea and coffee. Jam and cheese also are available. The breakfast was pretty good and always made freshly.The situation of the hotel is quite good, the British Museum is just a short walk away, Covent Garden and Soho are also within easy reach.I would recommend this hotel to all people who are looking fo a budget hotel, but whoever wants a little more comfort should search elsewhere. Also not everyone might like the area."
34,1109,"Feb 4 2006	Cosy and clean	Regency House is definitely an above average hotel. The location is excellent- 5 minutes walk to the station and near to many shops and restaurants. It is within walking distance of the British museum and Oxford St. We were very content with our room as it was clean and spacious (the staff kindly gave us a triple room even though there were only two of us). Although the bathroom was small, that is to be expected in London. Our room faced onto the backyard and it was not noisy. If you are a light sleeper it would be best to request a room that is not facing Gower St as it is a main road.The breakfasts each morning were fantastic (bacon, eggs, baked beans, toast, cheese, sausages, coffee and tea) and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This is an excellent bargain in London and it was evident that this hotel is lovingly maintained by its staff."
35,1109,"Dec 14 2005	Excellent B	Loved this hotel. It was our first trip to England and I had heard stories of the unimaginably small rooms in Europe. Not so here. The room was adequate size, very clean. The staff was helpful and gracious. The English breakfast every morning was essential to start out the day. Great location, but I would ask for a room at the back, not facing Gower Street, if you need complete quiet to sleep.I would reccomend this hotel without hesitation, especially for first time visitors who may be overwhelmed with the choices and want to operate within a modest budget."
36,1109,"Oct 13 2005	Good place to stay	Small rooms but they do their best with the space available. Clean, which is unusual from other B&amp;Bs in the area. Friendly staff. Have stayed often and will do again."
37,1109,"Jul 10 2005	Great Small Hotel	This is a well located, small hotel with fourteen bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms. Three short blocks from the Goodge Street underground (Northern line), three longer blocks from Euston Square (Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines) and also close to several bus routes. About 500 metres from the British Museum and just over twice that to the theatre district, so walking to these areas is easily manageable. The downside to the location is that you are on a fairly busy street, although I found the noise levels quite acceptable.I was allocated a single room at the rear with direct access to the courtyard garden. The room was small, which is to be expected at this price level in London. It was well kept and clean with a new carpet, firm single bed, very small wardrobe, small writing table with kettle and telephone, and a television. Since the room is on the ground floor directly off the entrance hall and next to the staircase used to go down to the breakfast room, the door has had additional padding added to help cut down on noise. I rather enjoyed the smell of breakfast coming up but my fellow traveller in the room directly above did not. The en-suite bathroom (shower, toilet, and wash basin) was one of the smallest I have ever used. Water pressure and temperature range for the shower were more than satisfactory. Once again all was well maintained and clean.The breakfast room is busy for the last half hour it is open and the food is good. I didn't try the coffee but my fellow traveller told me that it was &quot;typically British, not Continental.&quot; The tea was fine!This brings me to the hotel's service, which can make or break a guest's experience. I found it to be excellent. Everyone makes mistakes and it is how they are handled that makes the difference. I arrived late on the first evening to find that my booking for the first night had been lost in the system. The manager was telephoned, I got an immediate apology, and alternative accommodation for the first night was arranged within fifteen minutes. &quot;Taking ownership of a problem&quot; is something that is often talked about but is encountered far less often in reality. The manager and the other two staff I encountered all knew what had happened, each apologised for it over the course of my stay, and everyone made sure that the rest of it went off without a hitch. The discount I was offered on the first night when I checked out was the cherry on the top to emphasize just how seriously the problem was taken.I would stay at the Regency House Hotel again without hesitation and, indeed, my fellow traveller has just done so."

1,1110,Nov 22 2007 	so bad it was farcical!	Stayed here for three nights recently. Absolutely awful! Room was shabby and dusty. Television did not work. Curtains in window were patrially off the hooks so curtains did not close fully. Toilet only flushed after three or four attempts. T.iles were cracked in the bathroom. This hotel is so awful it is farcical. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is in central London.
2,1110,"Sep 11 2007 	Excellent Location No Maintainence	The owners of this hotel probably realise that they have an excellent location. They know that the property is not too large to fill and given the locational advantage (Baker Street tube station is 5min walking distance) they will always get idiots like me who will pay GBP 100 + for a lousy room.Would still consider this as you do not get too many better options for this price in Central London. But if you do, pls stay away. The hotel staff is not arrogant but has a &quot;you need me, I don't need you&quot; kind of attitude.Expect a basic room with barely clean toilets. No elevators, cramped corridor. Wodden structure and Road facing so noise levels can be disturbing. If the idea is to explore London from a central location and use the hotel to just come back late at night and crash then book. Else please use the review and stay away !"
3,1110,"Sep 1 2007 	Could be a bargain if you book your train at the same time.	Midrange hotel, close the the magnificient regent park, the Cherlock Holmes Museum as well as Tussaud, cabs, buses, underground.ONE TIP: book your train/plane on expedia at the same time, or via a booking website and NOT directly to the hotel wich is 50 % more ... it was 100 euros instead of 150 !Breakfast not good .... but included with the price.BEN"

5,1110,"Apr 17 2006	everything we needed very friendly and helpful staff	Location excellent. Room seemed a bit shabby on first look but proved to have everything two of us needed, comfortable beds, hot water, relatively quiet outlook (depends on which room, we used 3 over our 2 stays,) hair dryer, free safe, TV etc. Some rooms were pretty tight but still comfortable. Breakfast excellent, staff very helpful and courteous and friendly.Underground transport to Heath Row easy from Marylebone.Price a bargain for London and we would definitely stay there again."
6,1110,"Nov 23 2005	Pretty good place.	I just got back from a 2 1/2 week stay at the Regent's Park Hotel. I was traveling by myself and I was given a double room. It was a pretty decent size room, with a big shower. I was given a room on the first floor in the back so I wasn't bothered by any traffic noise, but the floors on top were kind of squeeky so sometimes I was woken up by the noise. Breakfast was served in the restaurant next door and consisted of 3 kinds of cereals, meats, cheese, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, tomato and lettuce salad, yougurt, croissants, and rolls, coffee and tea. Great way to start out a long day of site seeing. The restaurant next door (Malasian) was excellent if you are to tired to go out to eat. The Baker Street tube is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, as well as Tesco, a supermarket with great ready made sandwiches, pasta, and salads. I would definitly stay here again. The staff was great and helpful (the manager helped me lug my 2 suitcases upstairs)."
7,1110,"Oct 29 2005	Good Location	Neighbourhood: This hotel is located in a pleasant area, close to two Underground stations (Baker Street and Marylebonne. Glouscester Place is a one way street that gets very busy from about 7a.m. until late in the evening.Our Room: Not bad. We (two people) were placed in a room for three. It was clean and comfortable. And, apart from the room needing a fresh coat of paint, we were happy for the extra space and good the good sized bathroom. The shower was a little tight. If you dropped the soap one would have to &quot;plies&quot; gracefully (like Anna Pavlova) to pick it up. The room was cleaned daily.Breakfast: Served in the adjacent Singaporean restaurant's main dining room on the basement level. We were very impressed with the massive atrium. The breakfast fare consisted of: cereals, yoghourt, fruit, croissants, cheese, juice, coffeee, etc...Staff: They were always very friendly and helpful. I had difficulty starting the heater, so I called for help and the concierege came immediately. Not a bad place to stay. I would seriously consider staying here again on future trips to LONDON."
8,1110,"Oct 11 2005	Good location-average hotel	Had a problem with the key upon checking in and didn't appreciate the condescending owner telling us that we &quot;don't listen&quot;. His contact with the public is limited thank god and we only saw him again once (grey hair in pony-tail). Regent's Park Hotel appears to be run by a Turkish-Brit family. I have no real complaints about the place, it was bare bones yet wasn't lacking in any necessities. The first picture on the expedia website of the hotel is inaccurate, there is no green overhang. The buffet breakfast is in a quiet adjacent restaurant and included yogurt, croissants, sliced ham, slice cheese, sliced turkey, orange juice, tea or coffee, rolls, 3 kinds of cereals and was great. There is also a McDonalds and Starbucks down Baker Street if you miss the breakfast. Its in a good location since its only 5 minutes to the Baker Street Tube stop but i'd try another location next time. Good cheap food is not readily available in all parts of London and Gloucester Place is one of those areas. Good food at affordable prices required a hike down to Oxford Street or over the Edgeware Road. We ate once near the Paddington Crown Quality Inn and agreed that hotel was in a better location."
9,1110,"Aug 5 2005	Keep your expectations realistic and you won't regret this.	We stayed here at the tail end of a business trip for some personal travel days. After staying in one of the best hotels in the city, I was expecting the contrast to be difficult but keeping in mind the excellent price (67 GBP) I never regretted the decision.The room key is a long rectangular plastic card, about 1.5 the length and twice the thickness of a credit card. It unlocks the door mechanically and also must stay inserted in the room fusebox to activate electricity.Avoid the upper rooms if the weather is warm as they're warmer than the lower ones. My room had a standing fan but it made a lot of noise; there was a bit of a heat wave at the time so I resorted to sleeping under a wet towel, which worked pretty well.The bathroom had seen better days but was nonetheless functional. Soap and linen provided. No clock or alarm is available (not counting the TV), and the wake-up call service is unreliable; hence, a traveller's clock would be a good idea/purchase. Say hello to the parrot in the lobby, but keep your distance if you're standing nearby as the droppings splatter.Madame Tussaud's is within easy walking distance, as is an excellent pub, a camera store, and a cheap (1GBP per half hour) internet cafe, all south/southeast within 2-3 blocks. Several convenience stores within a block or two. If you are looking for good restaurants/pubs head South/Southeast about 6-7 blocks and just wander from there.Tube (Baker Street) is about 4-5 walk away. If you're not familiar with London, major attractions (West End, Leicester Square, etc.) are reachable within 15-20 minutes but you will have to transfer subway lines probably once.If you are a business traveller or don't mind the extra expense, avoid the hotel's taxi service as it was slow and took away from the time we'd allotted to check in early at the airport. Rather, hail a street cab (faster) or take the tube to Heathrow (cheaper).The bed was clean, the bathroom was clean and functional; both were cleaned daily. That's pretty much all I was looking for. If you are prepared for a few rough edges, you should be able to enjoy your stay here."
10,1110,"Jun 5 2005 	Very good hotel near a beautiful park	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in Sep 2004, purchased for a good rate on expedia. The location is excellent - near baker street tube stop. Also within walking distance of the lovely Regents Park. There was some street noise in the room but not too bad. The beds were decent and the room was OK clean. Initially we had a problem with the plumbing but the staff were quick to help. All the staff I met were very friendly and helpful, one of the best things about this hotel. There was no lift but the staff were happy to help me with my luggage (which I did not experience in other hotels). Breakfast was decent as well. All in all a great stay and recommended."
11,1110,"Mar 13 2005	Good Hotel	Good London hotel for your money. It's a little walk from the underground, but is close to a great stop with several connections. It is also very close to a great, inexpensive pub. The free breakfast was good - coffee or tea, meat and cheese for sandwiches, toast, crossants, hard boiled eggs, etc.The room was very small but clean. I'd definitely recommend it!"
12,1110,Feb 28 2005	Nice Stay	The room was clean. The bathroom was as well. The bed was very comfortable. The area was excellent. The staff was helpful and friendly. It's a good budget hotel for the money.
13,1110,"Feb 4 2005	thank god i came to this hotel despite some bad reviews posted at your site.	i arrived in the hotel on the 31st january and leaving in a few minutes from now. i read the reviews posted at your site and they were a mixture of both excellent and terrible reviews. i was really not sure what to do but then as luck would have it, i had no choice as i was landing at heathrow in a few hours time and there was no time to explore any further. i was apprehensive but the treatment i recd from the moment i entered the reception on the 31st until today (4th feb) has been exemplary. this certainly does not reduce the hurt felt by other guests but then one asks to himself/herself why is it that one person is excited and other is not. well the answer may well lie within the 'context'. in a particular context something terrible can happen (from one's point of view) where as the same was in order from some other person's viewpoint. i wish to make a small suggestion to you pls - if it is possible, in cases where guests have raised serious concerns about a behaviour or transaction, it may be worthwhile putting the views of the hotel also in the same space so that new guests can take a considered decision. well, i for one, was surely lucky that i came here. speaking further, the room was clean, the water was hot and with pressure, the linen was clean, the breakfast was simple yet good, the noise was not there as i was on the back side of the gloucester place so all in all a wonderful experience. for me it was even better as i was working on the harcourt street that isa walking distance from the hotel."
14,1110,"Dec 8 2004 	Do not go - dishonest	Small, smelly room. I have been duped with the payment ( a pc virus made two bookings for the same room) and the owner charged twice. Dishonest people, do not go there."
15,1110,"Oct 4 2004	A Birdlover's Idyll	Love this hotel -- it feels like my second home. I always stay at the Regents Park on my way back to America from overseas. The lobby has a feathered resident, Zilli the African Grey Parrot, who likes to chew up, oh, passports, credit cards, what have you...! The staff are quiet and friendly; they'll fix you up with a ride to the airport, or recommend a favorite London museum (try the Imperial War Museum). Rooms are small but complete. Get a room facing the back (Gloucester Place road noise). Good water pressure, good hot water. Food at adjoining Singapura restaurant is tasty; conti breakfast nice and filling. A quick walk to the Queen Mum's rose garden in Regent's Park. But the best part... is Zilli the bird!"

17,1110,"Aug 4 2004	Very Nice Place to Stay	Stayed in this hotel July 17-20th 2004 and booked it due to the previous reviews on this site. This hotel is well situated and is very comfortable and clean. The standard of service and room quality is much lower in London then elsewhere, but I felt that this property gave me value for my money. The only complaint I have was that it was hot during my stay, and unfortunately in order to get air into the room, we had to have the window open. As we were in the front of the hotel, we overlooked the street which is a very busy street with buses and cars running up it all night long. This would not bother me in the fall or winter, but if you stay in the summer I would suggest you ask for a back facing room. The breakfast was good, with a reasonable assortment of options, but the 10 cereals (only 3) and the pain au chocolate the other reviewer mention were not present during our stay, however it was varied enough for the 4 days we were there. Note for the English Breakfast you have to pay extra. I found the beds a little hard for my liking, but to each their own. The location is fantastic otherwise, very close to Baker Street Tube Station with lots of shops and restaurants all around. I would definately stay there again."
18,1110,"Mar 29 2004	ordinary	Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, so ok for a 2 star hotel. However, the management did not acknowledge the inconveniences we had, I think he should have offered us some compensation, a discount, some fruits, or flowers. We checked in late afternoon when it was still bright outside and when we returned late and tired in the evening, we found our room in darkness, both the ceiling and wall lightbulbs were broken. At first, we thought we didn't know how the light switch worked, so after trying out all switches with no success, we had to call the reception. He was very helpful but we wasted almost half an hour in the dard whilst he went 3 flights of stairs up and down, to get the bulbs. I asked for compensation but no one paid attention to our request. We are asked to write to the management. I reserved this hotel based on the positive comments, so am I being too critical ? I would try out another hotel next time. The rate is not that good either : 89 pounds for a double room."
19,1110,"Mar 14 2004	Loving the breakfast!!	We got there about 10am Friday, and our rooms were ready- even though the check in time is around 2 o clock! The rooms are a bit small, but enough space to move around in and very clean! Beds are comfy, enough channels on the TV (even French, Spanish, German and radio!) Movies are ?7-95 but they were all recent ones such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Matrix. You can also pay for a Playstation. Enough tea/coffee choices in the room and a sachet of Galaxy milk chocolate which went down well!! Minibar is expensive though! Didnt open it! Got woken up by a fire alarm 6-30am on Sat, but we were back in the building within 10mins, and in another 10mins, a letter of apology from the manager had arrived- was impressed! The breakfast choice was huge and tried nearly everything. Rolls, croissants, pain au chocolat, cereal (about 10kinds and toppings) fresh fruit, fruit salads, cheeses, ham, yogurt, cooked breakfast (everything)....list goes on!! Lots of info in the room, and downstairs. Friendly staff helped us and gave us a map. Only about 5-10mins walk from Oxford St. and up the road is the tube station and bus stop. Only gripe was when we tried to get on the internet in the hotel it wouldn't work, as you have to pay by card. The food in the restaurant is nice too, and prices are reasonable for London. Next door to the famous Portland Hospital!! A good deal!!"
20,1110,"Mar 12 2004	A real find	This hotel is close to the centre of London and also to one of the city's loveliest green spaces, Regent's Park. The rooms and studios are simply but comfortably furnished, and clean. Someone with a green thumb makes sure that plants flourish in all the public areas, even outside the entrance in February, and Zili -- a delightful parrot -- takes an intelligent interest in all the guests. Mohammed Asas, the manager, who presides over the reception desk by day, could easily double as a concierge at the Ritz. He is gracious and kind and gives excellent advice on every kind of practical problem; his shrewd shopping recommendations would do Which? (or Consumer Reports in the US) proud. For an alternative to the very good Malaysian and Chinese food in the downstairs restaurant, I suggest La Gauloise -- a 5-minute walk around the corner, on Melcombe Street -- where the miraculously light and airy quiches and first-rate salads would not be out of place in Paris, and are reasonably priced."
21,1110,"Oct 4 2003	Wonderful stay	My husband and I stayed at the Regents Park and were thrilled. We found it easily accessable to everything you could possibly want to see in London via Baker street station and the &quot;Tube&quot;, which connected easily to the overground trian, or the double decker buses. We happened to be there during the summer heat wave of the century and in a country that does not do air conditioning this could have been a problem. Howerever I found this charming hotel above average for the area and price. We had a room facing the courtyard and it was quiet and cool. The water pressure in the shower was good and though the room was small, typical for London, it accomodated us very nicely. The Regents Park restaurant is absolutely the best chinese food I have ever experienced. This is for real. It is a little pricey but believe me it is worth it. We were there for two weeks and we ate there every night except three. We never got tired of it. It was so good. I would recommend the restaurant if you are in London no matter where you decide to stay."

1,1117,Aug 23 2009 	excellent budget stay in london	basic but clean bedrooms seperete toliet and shower blocks very quiet location minuets walk from saddlers wells theatre islington 5 mins walk best thing of all is the excellent cookded breakfast deffintly would use again
2,1117,"Aug 31 2008 	How broke are you?	I had spent a few nights at LSE's Passfield Hall and wanted to extend my stay, but they were booked up. The nice guy at the desk kindly called another LSE school and I was on my way, after (foolishly) putting down a nonrefundable deposit for 2 nights.There is nothing horribly wrong with Rosebery, if you are on a tight budget and don't mind Motel 6. The rooms were very clean, but things like the carpet and the furniture looked as thought they could've been replaced a number of years ago. My view was of the building behind, which looked more like a tenament than anything else. Also, as the cheapest of the LSE dorms, it seems to attract large groups of traveling students, and that's fine for them! Overall, too dingy, too old, too smelly, too depressing to feel like I'd want to come home even to spend a few hours here."
3,1117,"Aug 31 2008 	Great stay	For families on a budget this is a real good deal, As all people know staying in london is not cheap so getting a saving on your accomodation is a must and leaves more spending money,i had a triple room which was plenty big enough for me and my kids, The rooms were clean and comfy enough, the toilets were ok but the showers were a little out dated, more of a ball effect than a spray!!!, but they did the job.There is also a tv room and use of the internet and games for kids to play, not many but enough.The breakfast was exceptional for this budget accomodation, i've stayed in more expensive places than this and got a lot less for my money, as much drink and toast as you want then you can also pick your six items from a wide range of english and continental foods, a real deal!!!Angel was a lot quieter than we expected although its got loads of places to eat and drink, one gem we found was a vegetarian chinese restaurant on the main street called VEG all you could eat for 6.50, the food was amazing and the staff were so friendly, if you go any where then go here, you will not be dissappointed and a fab price.All in all this is a lovely place to stay not too noisy and very friendly and helpfull staff, there is also a place to leave your bags if your not departing straight away, If you love your luxuries then dont stay here, but if your on a budget and dont mind dodgy showers then i would give here a go, we'll be going here again."
4,1117,"Jul 10 2008 	It left a lot to be desired	I have just returned from my Roseberry Hall experience and it left a lot to be desired. I will say on the plus side the staff were lovely and very helpful and professional. The location is great. It is only about a 10-15 minutes walk from Angel Tube station and it is a lovely area with some great pubs and restaurants. The single room was a nice size and it was clean and had its own sink as well. In short, if you want to get a decent night sleep and have some level of comfort then this is NOT the place for you. When I booked (I was attending a workshop there hence why I chose this accommodation) they did not tell me that it would be full of college students attending the summer session of the LSE. The noise did not abate until at least 1 am. Logic tells me this is what college students do (at least I sure did!) so if I had known that I would not have stayed there. I have stayed in other college residences and they were not being used for students hence why I didnt think this would be the case here. Also, when I was going to my room I was struck by some bad smells in the hall ways although there was no obvious reason for these smells since the rugs appeared to be clean and fairly new. Next, I discovered that there was only one bathroom (2 stalls, 1 shower and a very old looking bathtub) for each gender on the entire hall. I was stunned at how the bin in the ladies was over flowing and how the bathroom had a very strong small of urine. Breakfast, as was mentioned, was large and varied. The temperature was luke warm at best.This is a great place if these things are not an issue."
5,1117,"Apr 23 2007	Good location - student hall of residence	This really is a student hall of residence, and feels like it, although much better furnished than in my day. It is built around a small garden, with a modest communal &quot;pub&quot; and a dining room below street level. Standard, nourishing, LSE breakfast - choice of six items from a range including fruit, yoghurt, cooked bacon eggs sausage etc. The location is ideal for Sadlers Wells, being about three minutes walk, and Islington - the Angel is less than 10 minutes walk. A major London bus route, the 19, goes down Roseberry. Although there did not seem to be much traffic at the weekend, the room on the third floor seemed to be noisy with traffic noise. And of course in a place like this one is at the mercy of fellow residents - if a group come back after midnight, you will probably wake up. Being a student hall, it is only available during holiday periods, but that includes the summer. The LSE website is very good and makes a booking an easy task. And you don't have to pay more than a small deposit up front."

1,1120,RCA London	Its a nice place to stay in Central London at this price..Just 2-3 min walk to Lanchaster Gate Tube Station..
2,1120,"Dirty.	The Paddington Hotel &amp; Royal Court Apts are all in the same building. Here is my review which is also posted on the Paddington Hotel Tripadvisor page: I do not recommend anyone in their right mind stay at this hotel - period. Even though it is conveniently located by the tube and the park - 5-8 minute walk, the hotel is going through some major renovation in the hotels. They are not renovating the rooms. My friends and I stayed here for two nights, we wanted to cancel our reservation entirely but they wouldn't allow it. They would charge us for 1 night stay if you cancel the reservation. If you stay for that 1 night, they'll charge you two night - twisted sales positioning. We were so frustrated, we stayed the required 2 nights and canceled the third night and made a completely new reservation somewhere else. The hotel room was disgusting, we had a kitchen in our room. The room was dirty and looked like roaches probably infested this place. The hotel staff was not too welcoming either. They were willing to move us to a bigger room if we paid some ridiculous rate, so we asked to see it first. We were all very horrified at their upgraded room. It was no better than the room we had. Save yourself the money, time and worrying about whether or not this hotel room will turn out okay and book somewhere else. I wouldn't stay here again - so i wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they clean up their act - staff &amp; room quality."
3,1120,"Nov 22 2009 	Value and location	Stayed here for a week. This was my second stay at this hotel. The hotel has been under renovation and they are working to update all rooms and public areas. We had a 1 bedroom renovated room on the first floor street side. The unit was clean and well furnished. The furnishings are IKEA, but it was nicely decorated in brown and black. The beds were firm and comfortable. The pillows were a bit flat, but each bed had 2 pillows. The bathroom was fully tiled with two large mirrors, and a large tub with handheld shower. The walls are thin - typical in Europe, and the road has traffic at rush hours, but they have added new windows and heavy drapes to cut noise, cold and light.The lounge included a fully equipped small kitchen with 2 burner stove, microwave and fridge. There was a table with 2 chairs, sofa and large TV with DIrect TV. Staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is 3 blocks to Paddington, 1 block to Hyde Park and 1 block to the Lancaster Gate underground station. It is a safe neighborhood. Two markets are in the Paddington Station, and there are many small restaurants in the area. Suggestion - bring a shopping bag or two with you for convenient shopping. It is not deluxe, but for London the location and price are right. I will return to this hotel."
4,1120,"Nov 8 2009 	good location and cheap	this place is a bit old, but it is good for the price, when you pay a cheap price you dont expect much, which made it seem good. Everything in the room worked, it was serviced every day, it felt welcoming and it was clean. Its close to stations and reasonably easy to find."
5,1120,"Nov 6 2009 	Fantastic Geat location reasonable price stay here	The apartments were fabulous, they are not the Hilton, but for a middle of the road holidayer i would highly recommend.We booked and paid online prior to arrival, upon arrival the staff were very helpful, the room was only a studio apartment, but was ideal for the two of us, we have reasonably high expectations and Royal Court exceeded them all.It was clean, everything worked and was very nicely decorated.Great location, only 3 mins walk from Tube or 2 mins from bus stopNice public lounge areaHelpful friendly staffWireless access in the lounge areaKitchenette in roomDownsides...It was front of hotel, so we could hear some road noise,(pretty quiet road though, so nights were not a problem)Even in mid October, the rooms were quite warm.The room and apartments were fabulous, our next trip to London will be based here.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
6,1120,"Oct 30 2009 	not worth it	This hotel is in a good location, and our room had a kitchen, which was nice. However, the front desk staff are rude and unfriendly. The walls are incredibly thin (which is common in old buildings in europe) but it meant that we were woken up each night by people above, below, and next to us. The pillows were lumpy and beds hard and uncomfortable. I would not stay here again."
7,1120,"Oct 30 2009 	Excellent value and location	My partner and I stayed in London in March 09 for a week. I spent ages on Trip advisor trying to find the best deal.I booked through this Hotel's website and got an apartment for a weekFor first time travellers, we didnt know what to expect. our plane arrived at 5am and we caught the train into the city, it was a 5 min walk from paddington station and the staff at the Front desk were so lovely and gave us our room even though check in time wasnt for another 8 hours! The location was the best bit as it was only a short walk to the main train station. Took us about 30 mins to walk to buckinham palace from there.The staff were more than happy to help us with any questions we had and always had a smile on their faces - really put us at ease when we got there!. The rooms were basic but had a kitchenette which saved us alot of money at meal times. Its definatlely a place for the budget minded but we would definately be going back there again and i would recommend this to anyone. Tip - when you book, ask for a room at the back of the hotel and ask for a renovated room"
8,1120,"Oct 18 2009 	Don't stay here but if you do ask to see your room before you pay	Disgusting. The first room they tried to put me in was filthy, size of a closet, with ratty grease stained curtains, carpet and linens. Second room wasn't any better. Desk clerk didn't care or didn't understand when I repeatedly said I want a clean room. Stupid me paid in full before I looked at my room. They have some renovated rooms, which I ended up staying in for an extra 100 pound (they cut me a deal, would have been a lot more). Even the renovated room was a joke. Cheaply furnished, leaky windows so I could enjoy the people smoking right outside, and a herd of cows living above me that never slept. I was ready to move to another place but just didn't want to waste half a day of my 5 day trip. Some people I met were staying at the Copthorne Tara, they loved it, and paid half as much. Only good thing about this place is the location, right next to Hyde Park, Paddington train station and the Embankment tube."
9,1120,"Oct 18 2009 	basic accomodation but excellent location	the location of royal court appartments is excellent for a sight seeing trip to london, the nearest tube station is about 5-10 minutes walk away and is on the central line, so trains are every couple of minutes. there are a number of bars and restaurants about a 15 minute walk away, or 1 stop on the tube if you have a day pass.The apartments were pretty basic, but clean enough and the staff were really friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay in london this place is perfect!"
10,1120,Oct 13 2009 	Very good But......	It was a great stay however the room was not serviced well some days the towels and equipments were not changed and we asked for it from the reception.Also they told us there is safe inside rooms but we didn't found it and it was a problem using safe at the reception and asking the receptionist to open it daily.Otherwise it was great.
11,1120,"Oct 8 2009 	Great for a family with teenagers	Our two-bedroom apartment was great for our family (mom, dad, and 3 girls: 17, 14, and 12). The kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfast and after-theatre snacks. The rooms, while small, were large enough, and gave everyone an opportunity for some privacy when needed. The carpet was a bit worn, and the appliances out of date, but that didn't matter. We had daily housekeeping service, plenty of towels, a friendly front-desk staff, and free internet access. It was very well located, in a safe neighborhood near restaurants, stores, and Paddington Station."
12,1120,Oct 8 2009 	smelly..dont visit till refurbishments are finished..	on arrival you will be asked to pay for your visit upfront...go to your room and you will see why!!!.. the really nice foyer and lounge area will lull you into believing you have made a good choice...dont be fooled... from the first floor up the place is terrible..smelly and workmen everywhere.. carpets covered in paint...shouldnt be open till it is refitted...would be worried if going before easter 2010..you have been warned..!!!!
13,1120,"Sep 30 2009 	I will return	I stayed in this hotel in 2005 &amp; in this recent trip, i purposely sought accommodation at RCA for its close proximity to Kensington Gardens, Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations; it's easy &amp; regular access on busses and restaurants. The hotel room was quiet, clean &amp; tidy. In fact I was surprised that the hotel had expanded and updated the rooms making it much nicer than expected. So I was very glad with my choice. Its absolute value for money. In fact I believe you get more than what you pay for! My partner &amp; I had a trouble-free &amp; pleasant stay. I would definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to London."
14,1120,"Sep 23 2009 	Little Gem	The location of this hotel was brilliant as it was so close to the tube station -Lancaster Gate (3 mins), and Paddington Station was only 10 mins away. The staff was very polite and helpful. We paid 35 for our room which we asked for a double bed but was given a twin bed. We were not happy as we did specify a double. After a few words with the receptionist who was very polite she gave us a single apartment with a double bed.Although the room was a little old fashioned; everything was very clean and tidy. The only complain is that it is rather noisy! You can hear the floorboards creaking in the morning! and the noise from the streets but apart from this,all is fine. I will come here again and do recommend this hotel."
15,1120,"Sep 17 2009 	Still the best deal in London overall	This was my second stay at the Royal Court Apartments, and I plan on staying there again on all future trips (unless the hotel goes downhill, that is!).I requested a refurbished room, and was given one -- on the ground floor. This is the only thing I wasn't thrilled with. The room I was given was actually built slightly (just slightly) underground, and most of the ground floor was still under construction. There was no noise connected to it, but it was a bit of a no man's land. The room next to me had people in it, and across from me seemed to be a linens storage room or some sort. But I don't think the rest of the floor was ready for occupation yet. The good point regarding this? It was quiet! Well, save for a few times that my neighbors talked very loudly while leaving for the day or slammed their door.The other issue was that, since I faced the wall of another building and wasn't higher up, there was no natural light coming in at all save for the daytime when the curtains were left open. And the room lights were terrible. I mentioned in my first Royal Court review that I found the lighting from my last room to be bad. Well, this stay was far far worse. It was so dark I couldn't even see what I was doing in the kitchenette area at night. Everything else just looked dim and felt dark. It was already a bit weird being on the floor I was, so the lighting didn't help things. It made it feel as if I was in a basement apartment.The bathroom was split into two (shower and sink room, and then a toilet and sink room, both across from each other). This was a little weird at first, but it made things easier as far as where I kept my shower toiletries vs where I kept my getting dressed ones. So not a problem despite a seemingly odd setup.The lighting in both bathrooms was great, as was in between in that little &quot;hall&quot; area. But the rest of the room was sooooo bad. Thats the only part I really really hated. Everything else amenities wise was fine (as it was my first time there). The room was VERY roomy, clean, well upkept. The kitchenette has near everything you could want or need (still no salt &amp; pepper though!), and it's perfect. I just couldn't see what I was doing!The only other warning I'd give for those with the ground/basement floor rooms is that the TV reception is funny. The hotel seems to have subscribed to Sky since my last stay (Yay! More channels than just a handful!). But due to the location of the room, it would sometimes take a while to load up, and some channels just wouldn't. I couldn't get ITV or ITV2 at all save for my first night. Seeing how the things I purposely wanted to see were on these two channels, it was a bit annoying. There was also no channel guide in the room, so I had to flip around a lot. That would be handy to have in the room.As I said in my first review months back, the location of this hotel can't be beat. You've got 4 tube lines at Paddington Station, plus train services to the south west leaving from there, plus many food options in and near the station. You also have the Central Line at Lancaster Gate in the opposite direction, though try not to use that one for topping up your Oyster or other personal services since it's often packed with tourists from Hyde Park.I'll definitely be back at the Royal Court Apartments, I just hope to not be on that ground floor again unless they've installed some better lighting!"
16,1120,"Aug 28 2009 	Great place for economy traveler	In short: great location, great price (EUR 94 per night in an unrenovated, but spacious 1 bedroom + kitchenette + couch&amp;tv -area) and friendly staff.Me and my friend stayed at room 103 (unrenovated in Aug 2009), first floor, with a view to the backyard (quite ugly, but there's always the tv). The hotel is currently under renovations, as are some of the other buildings on the street, so a view to the street would had been noisy.The room itself was outdated and a little dirty (candle wax on the sofa table, stains on the carpet), but it also was very spacious (two separate rooms, big windows) and had separate wc and shower rooms. The kitchenette was surprisingly clean (we were prepared to clean it ourselves) as were the wc and the shower rooms.TRANSPORT TIPSIf you arrive to Heathrow, take the Heathrow Connect -train to Paddington, as it only costs 7,40 GBP one way and takes less than 30 minutes. From Paddington there is a less than 10 minutes walk to the hotel. (The tube costs app. 5,50 GBP, but takes more than an hour, and you have to change lines.)If you are staying for at least a week, buy the Travelcard (Transport for London, app. 26 pounds for tube zones 1-2 per week), as it grants you access to all the central tube and bus lines 24 hrs a day. For nightlife lovers there are several 24hr and night bus lines from the city center to the closest stations (Lancaster Gate and Paddington), so you don't have to take a cab (app. 20-25 pounds from Trafalgar or Piccadilly). We found the night buses to be safe and trustworthy. Visit http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ as they truly have loads of useful information onsite."
17,1120,"Aug 24 2009 	Great price and nice location near mass transit	My wife and I spent our spring break in London for 6 days at this hotel. I picked it in large part based on the reviews here and was not disappointed. The room was nothing special but I didn't expect it to be. After all, we weren't there to sit inside and watch movies. But it was nice to have a sink, microwave, and small refrigerator, though we barely made use of them. If we ever return we'll probably use them more.Easily walked to from the Paddington Station. We took the Heathrowe Express train into Paddington and walked in probably 10 minutes, tops, to the hotel. From the hotel, it's about 3 blocks or 5 minutes, roughly, to walk to the north end of Hyde Park and the Lancaster tube station for easy subway access to the whole city. Overall, because of the excellent subway system (or buses), it was no issue that this hotel is on sort of the far west side of London's attractions. If you want to walk a lot you can, but it was easy to get most anywhere pretty quickly from the hotel. The front desk staff was nice enough for what was required (basically just handing us our room key every time we returned from going out), and we experienced no problems in the room itself. The hotel does also have 2 internet computers which made keeping up on current events back home pretty easy. I think the cost was something like 2 pounds for 30 minutes, maybe even just 1 pound. So they aren't free, but not too expensive, either. Overall, I'd stay here again."
18,1120,"Aug 21 2009 	Compact comfortable great location	We satyed 3 nights in one of their newly decorated rooms on the ground floor. Clever compact kitchen, dining table and chairs and well decorated bedroom and bathroom. Great shower! The corridor is still a work in progress but all other public areas very nice. 5 minute walk from Lancaster gate tube station and Hyde Park, location couldn't be better. Una, Dublin"
19,1120,"Jul 17 2009 	Great Location	The RCA is right around the corner from Paddington Station and down the block from Lancaster Gate Tube stop. Super easy to get around town, even with the Tube strike while we were there, many buses run out of Paddington. We did not have one of the refurbished rooms but were very happy with the big room we did get, living room and separate bedroom. Yes the TV didn't get many channels, the couch was not that comfortable and shower leaked, but we didn't spend that much time in our room for that to really matter. Staff was kind, helpful, replaced the towels and made the beds every day. There are computers in the lounge you may use for a small fee, free wifi in the lounge as well, but we were able to get the wifi connection in our room on the 2nd floor without a problem. There is an M&amp;S in Paddington Station so make sure to stop and pick up your supplies. (There was a wine key in the room, fyi) It is what it is... a good budget hotel. We wish the bar was opened. :)"
20,1120,"Jun 27 2009 	Good place to stay on a tight budget	I and my teenaged son stayed here for two weeks in June '09. The location is very nice, situated between Paddington and Kensington (across the street from Hyde Park) stations. If you're coming from Heathrow Airport, the Heathrow Express stops at Paddington. From there it's maybe a ten minute walk to Royal Court Apartments. There are resturants and grocery stores which stay open past 10pm around Paddington station.The staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay. We arrived before our room was ready and they had no problem holding our suitcases for us. Our visit was split to two stays because we were in Scotland over the weekend. Both rooms we were in clean but looked a bit old. They were renovating while we were there so I assume that we were in rooms not yet redone. However they were both quite comfortable. There is no air conditioning and having the windows open is a must during the summer. The kitchen/living room included pots, pans, bowls, plates, cups, glasses, eating utinsils and the like. A small refridgerator, stovetop, oven, and microwave are also provided. We had requested seperate single beds for the bedroom. They were comfortable and clean. The bathroom either comes with a bath/shower or just a shower. The staff will replace the towels daily.Wireless internet is available in the lobby for free. However most of the time I could access it from my room on the second floor.The only drawback is that the first week we stayed on the front side of the building and the street noise would have kept us awake if we hadn't brought earplugs. The second week we were on the back side and had no problems.I will stay here again the next time I'm in London."
21,1120,"Jun 25 2009 	Pleasant Accommodations at a Good Price	We were very pleased with our experience and would stay here again. The hotel was convenient to Paddington Station and the staff was very friendly. Our room was spacious and the kitchen was well-equipped with dishes, tea pot, toaster, glasses, sliverware, etc. The bed was small, but comfortable. The decor was a bit dated and run-down, but the room was clean. Our room faced the street and it was noisy and not very dark at night. The internet access in the lobby was 50p for 15 minutes and was very nice to have available. Overall, it was a very positive experience at a good price (87 pounds per night)."
22,1120,"Jun 21 2009 	Cheap 	Room was very clean, maybe a bit dated, but for the price was definatly worth it. Our room (505) was on the top floor, which didnt have a lift to it.We enjoyed our stay, because of its cheapness, cleanliness and brilliant location for tube/hyde park, we will definatly stay again!"
23,1120,"Jun 21 2009 	GREAT VALUE IN AN EXPENSIVE CITY	Had an enjoyable week stay here from 13th to 20th April 2009. Had read a lot of the reviews on Tripadvisor and was looking forward to my stay here and wasnt disappointed.I had booked a double studio for GBP 53 per night directly with the hotel and seemed really good value for such an expensive city as London. I arrived around 9 am and as expected wasnt able to check in until 2 pm, but they did store my luggage for me which is a thing some London hotels wont do or charge you for it. Came back after 2 pm and was able to check in however like another review on here I wasnt able to get my booked double studio and ended up being upgraded to a twin one bedroom flat which at first I wasnt thrilled with as I wanted a larger bed, but turned out to be good in the end as the second bed came in handy as storage space.Like a lot of hotels in London this hotel I suspect started out as a 4 or 5 grand homes built about 150 years ago and as a result the rooms and hallways are a bit of a mishmash and not that logically laid out. My room number 103 was a perfect example of this. There was a small entry hall with a very cramped toilet and wash basin in a very tiny room off to one side with a reasonably sized combined living and dining area plus a very small kitchenette, so small that the microwave has to be mounted on the wall very close to the sofa and if you are not careful when you sit on the sofa you bang your head on the microwave, but only once. The bedroom is very long and narrow with 2 single beds end to end with a wardrobe in between them. Off the bedroom was a very, very tiny shower room with one of the tiniest shower I have ever experienced. This room was one of the unrenovated rooms and the furniture and fittings had seen better days but was adequate. My room faced the rear courtyard and overlooked the roofs of the mews houses behind the hotel and noise wasnt an issue for me. The hotel has a nice lounge area off the lobby with free wifi access. There are two very small lifts in the hotel which were a bit slow and I found the stairs more convenient when leaving and there was plenty of evidence of the renovations going on at the hotel when using the back stairs.While the above may sound a bit negative overall I was really impressed given the price, location and the helpful staff and will be the first place I look at when I next visit London.The location is about a 2-5 minute walk to Lancaster Gate underground station and about a 7-10 minute walk to Paddington station. The surrounding area is rather elegant and has a good selection of restaurants towards the Paddington station area. I picked up a rental car on the Friday afternoon and had no problem parking within 50 metres of the hotel on Friday, Saturday and Sunday after about 7pm.If you are looking for inexpensive, well located accommodation in a very expensive city I cant see going past the Royal Court Apartments."
24,1120,"Jun 16 2009 	Good value for London older room but clean and comfortable	Stayed for three nights, room was one still to be renovated but was clean and well equipped with a kitchenette containing everything you would need. A real bonus was a pedestal fan providing some air movement. The staff were very courteous and helpful and the location quiet but handy to parks, shopping, Tube and Paddington Station"
25,1120,"Jun 6 2009 	Average lodging near Paddington station	We stayed at Royal Court Apartment from May 24-28. This apartment is an average type of lodging. It's an old building, and it looks like it needs a paint job. The carpet needs to be replaced. However, the one bright spot is the bathroom has been remodeled recently. The apartment has a full kitchen (refrigerator, microwave, plates, mugs, utensils). It's useful if you plan to buy your food at the supermarket instead of eating out. There is no hair dryer in the apartmentDon't use the phone in the room; they'll charge you 0.25 pounds per minute even if you are using a pre-paid calling card. There is an internet service for 1 pound per 30 minutes.The apartment is 2.5 block from Paddington station. From Heathrow, you can take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station."
26,1120,"Jun 5 2009 	Very good	I stayed there with my wife, my sister and my children. The position is fantastic, just 3 minutes walking from the tube and fantastic Hyde park. Ther are also a lot of restaurants. The staff was very friendly, a special thanks to Cristiano a very helpfull man! Grazie Cristiano! I suggest the direction to improve the cleanliness of the apartments...not so good"
27,1120,"May 20 2009 	Disappointing	Having stayed here several times in the past 6 months, we were very disappointed in the room and service this time. Room 111 - 1st floor rear. 2 single beds back to back and an `ensuite' that you could hardly move around in. The room was clean but the decor and fittings have seen much better days. Windows were filthy, curtains hanging off rails, electrical sockets badly fixed, light bulbs that didn't work. Shower look very uninviting. TV reception was awful, and despite asking for help, none was forthcoming. The bar doesn't seem to have been used in months and there were mattresses being stored there. I'm only glad we stayed one night. I think it's disappointing that RCA clearly does not value brand loyalty. I think that RAC needs to spend some money on refurbishments before it loses it's trade."
28,1120,"May 14 2009 	Great stay and great location	We had 2 suites; One for our three teenage daughters and one for my wife and I . It was great having two bathrooms and two sitting areas. Only complaint is that the kitchen had very few dishes, cups, and utensils. The coffee pot looked ancient so we ate breakfast out everyday. But overall, this is a terrific choice. Quiet neighborhood to come home to after being in the over crowded tourist areas. Less than a 10 minute walk from Paddington and the Heathrow Express. Less than a five minute walk to Lancaster Gate and the Central Tube Line. We will definitely keep this hotel on the list for the next trip."
29,1120,"May 13 2009 	Very good value for Money	Me and my girlfriend decided to stay here on our first holiday together, When we stayed the rate was roughly 54 per room per night for a double room. The room ws lovely beed was a good size. Very comfortable I had no problems gettin to sleep. the only issue would have been for some that there were some road works going on around the hotel but they didn't start until 8 in the morning. By which point we were already awake and gettin ready to start the Journey for whatever we had planned on each day.Bed was good size, The the little Kitchenette proved to be a godsend when it came to making breakfast and random midnight munchies. We had a kettle, tea, coffee, sugar, cups dinner plates, Two slice toaster and a microwave which also proved handy after we went to a restaurant and the portions were too huge to eat them all so we took some home and reheated them later that night to enjoy while watching a movie on the decent sized TV. Plenty of storage space for our clothes. a very comfortable little 2 seater sofa in the room as well as a little dining Table which made us decide to get a takeaway on a few nights and bring it back there to have at our little dining table. The hotel was only about a 10 minute walk from paddington train and tube station which is good if you are flying to Heathrow because you then get the heathrow express train straight to paddington station. It is also very close to lancaster gate station. There are many restaurants nearby within a couple of minutes walking distance. the usual suspects, McDonalds, Burger king, Kfc, but then there area couple of Steakhouses, A few bars that served up Sunday roast, several indian and Italian reastaurants nearby. and if you would prefer to cook yourself a meal in the dinnette then there are a few little food markets nearby also. The area the hotel was situated in seemed very nice, Didn't feel at all threatning and on a few occasions when I remembered somthing i need to get for the next day I was more than comfortable walking around the local area on my own.The hotel is in Tube zone 1 which was good beause all the attractions that I wanted to see were all located in zone 1 or 2 which meant a tube card valid for 3 days of travel between zones 1 and 2. From paddington we went to London zoo, Camden market, Natural History museum, British Museum, National gallery, London Dungeons, Tower of London, Hyde Park and regents Park and the Peacock Theatre near the west end.Perfect location, Excellent value room for the price paid. Useful Kitchenette, Friendly staff. and use of the storage room since we arrived at 9 in the morning and check in wasn't until 2 that day so we left our luggage in the storage room told them we would come back at 5 that even to check in properly and they were completely fine with that. Also our flight leaving london wasn't until 7 pm so they let keep the bags in storage there after the check out time of 11am so we were free to do as we pleased on that final day without have to take our luggage with us. I Have no complaints at all about the place would Definately stay here again."
30,1120,"May 5 2009 	Decent apartment good location great value for money.	We stayed here in april for almost a week during a London short break. Our room was a renovated one, wich we got at the unrenovated price. This meant a great value for money. We payed about 320 GBP for 6 nights for a studio apartment. Those who are familiar with London hotel prices will see the bargain here.The hotel itself is old. The signs of the time are evident. &quot;Renovation&quot; is mostly optical and can not conceal the outstanding maintenance. Our recently renovated room already had cracked floor tiles and the outside windows couldn't be closed properly. Various rooms are renovated at the moment, resulting in dust and noise, though work starts at a reasonable time in the morning. The room is adequate. Beds are horrible, but then again, they always are. Flatscreen tv with about 40 mainly english channels is free of charge. The kitchen is fully equiped for making Tea or coffee, breakfast and even lunch and dinner. Bathroom is ok. Towels are changed daily and there is a supply of various things that pleasantly surprised us in this price range: Toiletpaper, coffee, tea, sugar, milk, soap, shampoo, washing-up-liquid, sponge, kitchen paper are all complementary. The whole apartment is reasonably clean and cleaned daily. Staff is international and friendly. Reception is open 24 hours a day. There is a lobby with television and internet, and a bar wich was closed during our stay. The hotel is a five minute walk from Paddington train- and tube stations.At the price we payed, it was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. There was a leaflet with the normal (rack)rates on the reception desk. To be honest, I wouldn't have been so enthusiastic when I had paid the price stated there... So look out for a nice offer!"
31,1120,"May 4 2009	Excellent Hotel at a Good Price	When I booked a room at the Royal Court Apartments for my mother and me, I was a little concerned because of the widely divergent reviews here. But the price was right, and if the room is clean and the place is safe, I'm generally able to cope with tight quarters and outdated furnishings. Still, I was crossing my fingers that I'd get a refurbished room because that did seem to be the main factor that influenced people's reviews here.We were lucky enough to get a very nicely refurbished room on the second floor. Everything was modern and very clean. The cabinets were well-stocked with anything we might need to prepare meals in the room, and the room itself was spacious by London standards. My only--very minor--compliant is that the bathroom cold use more shelves and hooks for toiletries and towels. And it would be nice to have the hair dryer in the bathroom so you could see a mirror when using it instead of having it tucked in a drawer in the sitting area. The staff was consistently courteous and helpful, even making a special effort to get the room cleaned quickly when we arrived before 9 am, several hours before our 2 pm check-in time. The room was cleaned well each day, although they did neglect to replace our small milk containers for coffee and tea--no big deal because we had bought a large container ourselves to use with our breakfast, and I'm sure the front desk would have sent some up if we asked.The location is convenient, right between Paddington and Lancaster Gate Stations, with several bus lines stopping nearby. There are lots of restaurants and shops for snacks nearby. During our stay, there was some repair being done to the water mains near the hotel, which did create some extra noise during the day, but the street was generally quiet and felt safe. We also didn't notice any more squeaky floors or other room noise than you might expect in an older building.Overall, we had a great experience at the Royal Court Apartments, and I'll certainly consider them again for a future trip."
32,1120,"May 4 2009 	A great value for staying in London	Stayed here in Jan '09 with my best friend. We did a long weekend in London. When we first arrived it was pretty early, but they stowed our luggage while we went out for a few hours until our room was available. They actually showed us two different rooms and we had our choice. One was a newly renovated studio (which looked great), and the other was one of the older rooms but it was a suite. We went with the suite so we'd have a little more space to hang out in. The room had a bathroom, a separate bedroom with two beds, and a separate living room with a small kitchenette, small table and chairs, sofa, and tv. Obviously, since we chose a room that was not renovated, it was worn but it was kept clean. We didn't have any noise issues while there. The hotel also has free wifi. Some people would probably be turned off by staying in a older hotel room, but it is a seriously great value for staying in London. It's right near the underground, right near Paddington train station, near a grocery store. In short, the location and the price are fantastic."
33,1120,"Apr 16 2009 	Not the ""Ritz"" but value for money accommodation.	I was pleasantly surprised by these appartments. Welcome was very good, rooms was large (202) and reasonably equipped, location is excellent, and bed was clean and comfortable. Problem with shower was sorted out immediately. Decor a little shabby, but for what you pay, it's what you expect. We'll be returning if price is at a similar level."
34,1120,"Apr 15 2009 	Creaky floorboards - Kept us up all night.	Reasonable hotel in a good location. We were very much crossing our fingers for one of the new rooms, unfortunately we were disappointed. Apparently the room we booked was unavailable so they put us in an old room on the fourth floor. The room itself was fine. The only problem was that every time the person upstairs moved, the floorboards creaked very very noisily. It kept us awake almost all night and were it not for ear plugs, we would most definitely have been zombies the next day. Not the best way to spend a day sightseeing."
35,1120,"Apr 8 2009 	Rating depends on the room	Stayed here with teenage daughter for total of 6 nights in March. We arrived around 2 p.m. The first thing they wanted was my receipt from Priceline. Thought we were in for a nasty surprise as I have heard that Priceliners get the worst rooms. You decide what you think based on what happened next. First room they gave us was on the fourth floor. After lugging our bags up there, we found it was small, very dusty and musty. Since I have asthma, we asked for another room, but they said if we didn't like that, there was no other room available. The second room was on the second floor. It was larger, had a separate living area and a tele, but was even mustier than the first, but we didn't realize just how moldy it was when we took it and closed the windows and opened the bathroom door. pphhhheeeuuu! It was so bad I coughed all night, but didn't dare open the window with us asleep. There was scaffolding just outside the window from ground level to our window!Next morning, I dropped off my comment card telling them of my difficulty with the mold. The gentleman at the desk was too busy to look at it then. We were a block down the street with he came running after us to say he could find us a re-done room without any carpet. Great! So we moved our things for a third time, but this room was clean and no nasty smell coming from the pipes. We stayed here for 4 more nights, then we had to go to Wales overnight, so I booked for the following night since it is close to Paddington for rail access to Harwich. I had to pay ca. 65 pounds for that night &quot;because it is a new room.&quot; Understand that the hotel is redoing the rooms on a piecemeal basis, so you have to deal with the dust in the hallways. The structure is sagging and that is apparently not being dealt with as the new rooms with the flooring will buckle if they try to lift the floor after the remodel. Also, even in the new rooms, the drains don't drain. So, you decide if the room is up to your standard of cleanliness. If you have allergies and/or asthma, insist on a new room, but be prepared to pay more. It is not the staff's fault that this hotel is as it is and I feel for them having to deal with the smelly, musty workplace everyday. They were, with 1 or 2 minor exceptions, very helpful and friendly, especially Christiano, who helped us get a room I could actually sleep in. Thank you.Internet is 1 pound for half hour, but is very slow."
36,1120,"Apr 3 2009 	Great Location and a Good Budget Hotel	My wife and I stayed there twice in March as part of our holiday and stayed in room 204 both times. The Hotel is in an excellent location , down the road is Lancaster Gate Underground and Hyde Park , 5&quot; walk to Paddington Station and supermarkets there is also a nice pub down the road (The Swan). The room was good , we had a kitchenette, lounge and separate bedroom and plenty of cupboard space. While some of the furnishings were a bit tired especially the lounge that really was too difficult to sit on for long periods and the curtains that didn't fit the window exactly (we used a clothes peg to hold them together) , It is a budget Hotel and you know there will always be some issues. If we were to stay in London again I would be quite happy to stay there again, having the kitchentte was handy for us and the location was excellent. We found the staff were more than pleasant and helpful to us."
37,1120,"Mar 26 2009 	Super duper budget hotel	I stayed with three other aldies for a weekend in London. We were in room 503 on the top floor.On arrival we were greeted courteously and pointed towards the lounge to sit down while they checked us in. The receptionist gave us a choice of two rooms (neither refurbished), which I thought was nice. We went up to look at the rooms and then decide which one we would like. The receptionist arranged for our luggage to broought up to the room.We paid 34 a night each, so we weren't expecting much. But we were pleasantly surpised with the apartments (not refurbished). The open plan living/kichenette area was massive with a large dining table for 8 people to sit around. Plasma TV and light and airy with nice views over the town houses. The kitchenette was well equipped. Although the decor is very tired, we were not too fussed about this. Everywhere was extremely clean and the bed linen/towels looked as new. The bed and pillows were very comfy.Receptionists were always pleasant and friendy. We arranged a limo to pick us up for a surpise (it was a hen weekend) and they executed the arrangements for the the surprise very well. You couldn't be in a better location. Right between Lancaster Gate and Paddington stations. Also just a short walk to Hyde Park.All in all a very pleasant stay. The only reason I am not giving a 5 is because of the very tired decor."
38,1120,"Mar 24 2009	Royal Court Apartments London	My friend and I stayed in the Royal Court Apartments March 5-10th. It was a girls vacation and the hotel was wonderful! Right between Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate. Right around the corner from Hyde Park! And there was a great little restaurant around the corner (Rose Garden) that had very good food for very inexepensive price. They had English food for me to try and typical American food for my non-adventurous, eatting friend, so it worked perfect. We didn't get a refurbished room, but they upgraded us for free to a one bedroom. The room was a bit run down (but I didn't go to London to see the hotel rooms), lots of room for luggage and spreading out, the linens were VERY clean. Plenty of clean towels, toilet paper, soap. We had a blow dryer in our room. The kitchennette was very nice to have. I loved turning in my key before leaving each morning-one less thing to worry about loosing. I will recommend this room to all my girlfriends wanting to travel to London and I will stay here again when I return. The staff were pleasant and easy to work with. They will store your luggage if you arrive early morning and can't check in yet. The area is very safe. The hotel clean. Close to the tubes. Close to Hyde Park. Restaurant literally a 2 minute walk away from the front door and grocery stores around. What more could you want?"
39,1120,"Mar 3 2009 	A fantastic budget hotel in great location	This is my 1st choice hotel in the Paddington area. I have used them a number of times when working in London, and is my choice of budget hotel in the area.Positives:Location  5 minutes walk from Paddington station.Rooms  I have stayed in both the newly refurbished rooms, and the rooms which are currently awaiting refurbishment (I believe an on-going project), and whilst the rooms that are awaiting refurbishment are slightly tired and dated, they are clean. The newly refurbished rooms are excellent and modern.Staff  Always helpful and friendly.Negatives:Rooms  Rooms awaiting refurbishment are dated.Keys  Im not a fan of having to hand your room key in every time you leave the hotel.This would be my first choice if I were looking for a budget hotel in London."

41,1120,"Jan 28 2009	Budget location	Stayed here 4 nights. The location was great, room a little run down but OK for the price we paid. Should probably stay here again!"
42,1120,"Jan 22 2009 	Perfect location	We spent 4 days in this hotel. When we entered the room we had a good laugh. A romantic weekend in a long, narrow room with two single beds:) A large sittingroom/kitchen with a tired sofa and two wooden chairs and a tiny little bathroom. Even if the room was in need of a lot of diy it was clean and tidy.The location was perfect, close to Lancaster gate underground and The Serpentine in Hyde Park. It was a 15 min. walk to Marble Arch (Oxford street). After all we had a great time in this hotel and in London, and if the price is right we will stay here another time."
43,1120,"Jan 8 2009 	Worst place we stayed in Europe	If I had a do-over, I'd pay at least twice what I paid to stay here in order to get a marginally superior room.The &quot;apartment&quot; (really just a hotel room with kitchenette/sitting area) we stayed in was tiny and extremely shabby, bordering on musty. Nubby carpet, uncomfortable twin beds, closet of a bathroom. Add to that the fact that they placed us in the apartment next to the elevator well, THEN ACTED LIKE THEY HAD NO CLUE when we inquired about the constant clanging noises all night and all day...and, well, we were two very grumpy travelers. Oh, and the neighborhood's just ok, not interesting. I don't seek touristy neighborhoods and would be fine with boring if the &quot;apartments&quot; had otherwise been suitable.This really colored our experience of London, unfortunately. Pay extra for something more comfy and interesting, it's worth it."
44,1120,"Dec 23 2008 	Avoid This Place At All Cost	For the amount this place is charging, it is NOT worth the stay. Expedia advertised it as a 3-star hotel. It turns out that it really is a run down 1-star apartment. I don't know who's putting up the false pictures of a flat screen television and leather couches but it is all wrong!!! UGHHH. I booked the place for 8 nights but checked out the moment i checked in. The floors and the walls are so thin and old that it constantly squeeks when people move around. How can anyone rest in that kind of condition?? The two vintage computers they have in the lobby cost 1 pound for 30 minutes! I put in 1 pound for half an hour to search for another hotel but the internet didn't even work! When I asked the front desk staff to refund my money since it didn't work, THEY REFUSED to. What kind of customer service is that?! Plus, how can anyone be okay with staying at a hotel where they ask you report to them whenever you step in or leave (you have to leave your key with the front desk when you leave and pick it back up upon return). For this kind of an environment, I would rather have stayed at a hostel and paid a lot less for the same. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy! I ended up checking into a Hilton not too far from here and paid nearly the same amount for a pool gym, and amazing customer service."
45,1120,"Dec 9 2008 	Great location at a great price	We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms. A great size room which was well heated (it was freezing outside), friendly staff, what more could you want.Right beside the tube, excellent value for money. I would highly recommend it."
46,1120,"Nov 28 2008 	Cheap clean good location	The room, 115, was very clean. It had all we needed for our 3-night stay. The staff was very friendly, helpful and serviceminded. The location is excellent, only 2 min away from the tube, Lancaster gate. According to information on the web-site, Paddington station is supposed to ble the nearest station, but in our opinion, Lancaster gate is closer."
47,1120,"Nov 28 2008 	Bleak house	Reception was excellent, really friendly and room ready before lunch. The room in itself was small but OK, a good bed, TV and facilities for cooking which were fairly good. The bathroom was really to a side in the entrance to the room. Straight across a very small toilet with hand basin (very cramped and cold). The view outside to a small walled area was dismal with all sorts of leftovers on the ground (such as cigarette buts etc) which was green from organic matter. See photo. This should scare a few americans but as I only stayed for one night it was really no problem. The corridors to the rooms are very run down and from time to time filled with garbage and sleeping sacks (?) and even people sitting on the floor (employees or transient workers?)."
48,1120,"Nov 12 2008 	Great Value	Stayed here the first weekend of November. Absolutely satisfied, great value as we got one of the renovated rooms. Very convenient to 2 metro stations and bus stop. Staff were very friendly.Got a room on the top floor facing the street. There was no traffic at all, and it was very peaceful. Like having your own little private apartment. The toilet could only flush about once every 40 min, but forgot to report this to the hotel, but this didn't bother us much. Especially convenient if you come via the Eurostar (only need to take one line to get there, from St Pancras to Paddington Station)."
49,1120,"Nov 9 2008 	Budget but good location	Stayed here for 3 nights in June/July in the middle of what would probably considered a London heatwave. Evenings were quite warm with no air conditioning.Apartment was quite large as it consisted of three rooms, in a lounge, bedroom and the bathroom. Neither of which were large but considering the price was a lot bigger than most London accomodation.Building was quite old, the lifts were slow and creaky and the floors in the hallways were very noisy as well. Perhaps the worst aspect was the bathroom/shower, which felt like it was 4 foot in the air, leaked badly all over the floor and there was mould everywhere.Despite all this for London it wasn't THAT bad, the location was excellent, easy to find from Paddington train station, and walking distance to Hyde Park. The staff were excellent and let us check in early (like 8am) which was excellent after a long flight from Singapore. The hotel was very quiet at night though and the bed comfortable, all a big positiveThe hotel seemed to be in the middle of a refurb, and with some improvements to the bathroom etc would be fine - would definately stay again in a refurbed room"
50,1120,"Oct 29 2008 	Excellent value for money	The hotel is located close from Paddington Station (about 8 minutes walking) and Lancaster Gate. Both Heatrow Connection and Heatrow Express stop at Paddington Station.Neighboorhood is calm with shops, restaurants and Tesco around.Staff was very kind and gave us a refurbished room with kitchen. Since we were at the ground floor, we could access internet inside from our appartment.The hotel is refurbishing some rooms so you can hear some noise during the day."
51,1120,"Oct 28 2008 	Not Fancy But A Fantastic Homebase	I stayed at the Royal Court Apartments for three days and I had a great experience. The front desk staff are friendly and helpful, the room I stayed in was clean and comfortable and you just can't beat the location. It's an easy walk to not one, but two Tube stations, an easy distance from a grocery store and Hyde Park. Very convenient. Having a refrigerator and a hot plate in the room saved me SO much money in food costs- let's face it, London is crazy expensive, so being able to cut costs where I could and cook in my room was a huge plus for me. Free WiFi being available in the lobby was also a nice plus.These aren't the nicest rooms in the world, there are obvious signs of wear and tear around, so if you're looking for somewhere posh to stay I'd skip this place. To me it was just perfect, though. A clean, comfortable place to take a hot shower, eat a warm supper, check my email, plan the day ahead and then crawl into a comfy bed after a long day. I'm looking forward to my next trip to London and I'm planning to stay here again."
52,1120,"Oct 27 2008 	Good Value	This place has a great location. Just a few blocks from Paddington Station with the National Rail, Circle, Distric and Bakerloo lines and fewer blocks to Lancaster Gate Station with the Central Line. I got a studio apartment for 60 a night and stayed from the 1st October to the 28th October. The front desk staff was helpful and didn't become too familiar which is easy to do when staying any length of time. The apartment had a seperate bathroom with toilet, shower and sink. The main room had tiny but comfortable bed, table, TV, sink, stove and came with all equipment; silverware, dishes, toaster, pots and pans etc. The street noise was a bit much, but didn't start until about 7.30 which makes for a great alarm clock. It was cleaned daily and new towels provided. If you use a wash cloth, bring your own. Soap, shampoo, tea, coffee and sugar provided."
53,1120,"Oct 23 2008 	Great Location but Not Flash	This is a brilliant place to stay in London for one very specific reason; it's location. Plonked directly in the middle between Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube stations, it's brilliant for coming in from the airports and also for getting around central London. It's also only one block away from both Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens so fabulous for a walk around the parks and relaxing away from a bit of noise and traffic.The hotel itself is nothing flash, but then that's why it's not triple the price! The room we had included a small bedroom comprising of two single beds and an exceptionally small bathroom with a handbasin, toilet and tiny showerbox, a separate kitchen and lounge area with amenties suitable for making your own breakfast, tea/coffee and possibly a simple dinner by either the hotplate elements or the microwave supplied. We stayed here with our toddler son who slept on a rollaway single bed in the lounge and the overall size was very adequate for the one night stay.It's completely adequate for those travellers who would rather have somewhere clean and relatively tidy (if not a bit tired) to crash and spend their money on sightseeing etc. Nothing in London is cheap anyway and you will get better value for money outside of the city, but this - in comparison to others - is really good value. There is also a Sainsbury's in Paddington Station which is only two blocks away which cuts down costs for the overall stay. The staff are also very friendly on the front desk from a first impression perspective. The worst thing about the place would have to be the squeaky floorboards and the very narrow hallways outside the room, but this is certainly not a problem if you have realistic expectations on London accomodation. We would certainly come back here again and stay, if only for the lack of stress as far as getting to and from airports and railway stations! Be aware, there are no telephones in the room and obviously there are different standards for different rooms as some of the posted photos from other travellers show rooms which were alot flasher than what we had."
54,1120,"Oct 16 2008 	A great welcome but bring earplugs !	I stayed at RCA for 7 nights 9/7 thru 9/14. We arrived about 9 a.m. on sunday morning and we had no problems walking from paddington station. When we got there the receptionist asked us where we came from (oregon) and when we told her, she said that she would let us check into the room so we could shower and sleep. I thought this was very nice as we were about 5 hours early and she didn't charge us extra. Our apartment was on the fourth floor facing gloucester terrace. There was a small refrigerator, cooktop and microwave. Also a few plates, bowls and glasses. There were two rooms in our apartment. One had two twin beds and a wardrobe, the other room had the kitchen and a small couch and T.V. Gloucester terrace is a busy street and very noisy. I didn't bring earplugs with me and the first night I had trouble sleeping, the cars were speeding by all night. I went out the next day and bought some. With the earplugs in I had no trouble at all. If I stay here again I will request a room at the back of the hotel. DO NOT get the breakfast they sell. It is too expensive. I walked down to craven road and found a grocery store. I definitely saved money by eating breakfast in my room. Also there are plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance, just leave the hotel and make a left to craven road. I was very satisfied with the RCA !"
55,1120,"Oct 13 2008 	Great Apartment and Location	My husband &amp; I are a mature aged couple. After reading the reveiws of these apartments we were a little hesitant and asked to see the apartment before booking in. The apartment was a little old fashioned but extremely clean and comfortable. We had asked for a one bedroom apartment at the back of the building so we would not get noise from the street (thank you to Tripadvisors' reviewers).We had a large lounge with lounge chairs and coffee tables, with a small but very adequate kitchen complete with table and chairs. Large bedroom (hairdryer supplied) and lovely bathroom. No traffic noise at all. Coffee, tea &amp; sugar supplied daily, the room could be serviced daily if required.The location was terrific, the staff including the cleaning staff friendly and helpful. Stayed for 7 nights with no problems at all.After staying 2 nights in another much more expensive hotel and various hotels in Europe, we found that the Royal Court Apartment we stayed in was very good value for our money.Would recommend to our friends.Christine &amp; Brian, Sydney, Australia"
56,1120,"Oct 11 2008 	What a dump!	We only stayed one night at these apartments but wouldn't stay there again. The floors were dirty, wallpaper peeling off the wall, paint on cupboards very chipped and mould on the tiles in the bathroom. The hallways were disgusting with the wrought iron stair rails replaced in places with woven wire. Never again."
57,1120,"Sep 24 2008 	In need of repair	Agree with everything that's been said about this hotel. It's cheap and we were able to eat cheaply from Tesco (past Paddington station, past St Mary's Hospital). We had a twin studio with kitchenette and yes, they were renovating other rooms and no doubt this one was on the &quot;to do&quot; list. Even though it was very clean, the tiny bathroom was a bit disturbing, with peeling paint , broken fittings and seemingly held together with silicone. Water pressure was poor and the water was luke warm to cold due to renovations in progress (there was a notice about this in the lift). The toilet had to be coaxed into flushing at times. Location is great and staff are friendly but if I booked again I would ask for a renovated room."
58,1120,Sep 23 2008	warning - watch out when booking this hotel	I tried to book with this hotel for November 3 for 2 nights. I tried to fill out an enquiry form online but it didn't work as my email address was too long. The online rate said 52 per night for 7 days in advance booking. I then called and got through to bookings. I asked her how much it would be and she said 70 per night. I then asked whether it was cheaper to book online and told her the rate. She then said it was the same price. While she was on the phone I checked and confirmed that it was 52 per night. I could hear she was on the computer in the background. She then asked me to click refresh and the cost had gone up to 65! (70 non advance booking) She then tried to deny that she had changed it but it was pretty obvious to me. Although I still think this rate it reasonable I certainly wouldnt book here after being treated like an idiot. One less booking for the Royal Court Apartments.
59,1120,"Sep 22 2008 	Brilliantly affordable and a great location to boot!	My wife and I stayed at RCA for 4 nights at the end of August. I picked the hotel based on location and price (being one of the least expensive hotels in London). As other reviewers have noted, some of the rooms are a tad worn, though the owners were renovating one of the wings while we were there. Also, we found the front desk employees to be very friendly and helpful.We had a studio-kitchenette with a view of the backs of some houses, but it was perfect for us. We got great use out of the kitchen's fridge, microwave, and kettle. The bathroom was small, but serviceable. Despite not being brand new the place was still clean. We're younger travellers who still recall some hideous accomodations during our college years so this was quite alright with us and actually turned out better than I thought it would based on the other reviews I read here! :)So...go for the price, stay for the location--5 minute walk from Paddington Station where there are also many restaurants and a small supermarket to stock your kitchenette. It also is just down the street from Hyde Park, which is perfect for a first-evening-in-London stroll when you're still jetlagged and taking it slow."
60,1120,"Sep 22 2008 	Great value	We spent 2 nights in a studio double apartment. It had been renovated, with laminate flooring and new appliances, and was spotlessly clean. The location was great, and the staff helpful. The coin-operated internet access lounge was handy, allowing one to check email for only a few pence for a few minutes' access. The only downsides were that we were on the 5th floor, and the lift goes only to the 4th, there was no coffee maker, so we bought paper filters and got creative with the kettle, and there was no shelf to place toiletries in the shower. None of these issues ruined an otherwise pleasant stay."
61,1120,"Sep 17 2008	My secret apartment!	Royal Court Apartments, Gloucester Terrace, London.May 24-31, 2001.Very nice 3-star apartment on Gloucester Terrace. My husband and I stayed in a 1-bedroom and it was clean and comfortable with maid service daily. Two to three minute walks to bus stop, Lancaster Gate underground and Hyde Park. Walking distance to Queensway for shopping. There are grocery stores just around the corner from the apartment. Great value for the money and no more expensive than a 3-star hotel room. We liked it so much we are staying there again for a week in October!"
62,1120,"Sep 17 2008 	Worn and tired	Close to Paddington,about 8 minute walk.Nice lobby but our 1bedroom unit had worn out carpets,furnishings,uneven and noisy floor,bed was like trying to sleep on a rock.Desk staff was helpful and polite.Room in desperate need of a makeover.Would not stay again."
63,1120,"Sep 2 2008 	Great value and excellent location	My wife and I (mature couple) stayed here at the end of August 2008 for four nights. We had a 1 Bedroom apartment for 2 persons. It consisted of, a twin bedroom (quite small) a lounge cum kitchen area, and small bathroom with bath and shower. While the room was dated, it was nonetheless comfortable, but if you are looking for luxury, this would not be the place for you. I believe they are in the process of upgrading the rooms - we were on the second floor and these appear to be the old style. We had a front room, which if you are a light sleeper, would not be suitable as there is quite an amount of traffic on the street below. The kitchen was basic, but adequate, as we only had our breakfast there. If you were cooking full meals, I feel it might be a bit restrictive as the cooker had only two rings(plates) and there was no oven, but there was a microwave. A toaster was also provided. There was a small fridge, which would not hold a big supply, but there was a lot of small grocery shops/mini markets close by, with a Sainsburys in Paddinton train station, which was about a 12 minute walk from the hotel.There was no air con. in our room, but a fan was provided. The rooms were cleaned daily. We found the staff in reception to be friendly and helpful on every occasion. The hotel has a lift(elevator), but I understand it only goes to the 4th floor.It is ideally located - 12 minute walk from Paddington station, 200 yards from the nearest bus stop, from where you can get into Oxford St, Tottenham Court Rd. and Picadilly Circus. A further 100 yards on, is Lancaster Gate tube station. Hyde Park is just accross from the tube station. Within a 5 minute walk, in the Paddington station direction, there is a good selection of restaurants/eating places, reasonably priced.I would definitely use these apartments again, I consider them good value, good location, convenient to transport services and with Paddington station closeby, and very convenient if arriving in Heathrow airport. However, do not expect 5 star luxury or services, - it is ideal for anyone who will be out and about touring and siteseeing inLondon, who just wants clean and comfortable accomodation to come back to at night and get up whenever they want to in the morning and make make their own breakfast."
64,1120,"Aug 7 2008 	Satisfied with RCA	We stayed at RCA in Londond from July 19 thru July 25, 2008. Our 2 bedroom apt. was a good size for London. Kitchen better stocked with dishes etc. than I expected. Coffee and tea replenished everyday. All 2 bedrooms are on the 5th floor and the elevator only goes to the 4th but it was not to bad taking luggage up a few flights of stairs (unless you are elderly or have health problems. We had one of the updated apartments with leather sofa, chair in sitting area which was very comfortable. One drawback was lack of dresser space in the one bedroom but the master had a set of 5 drawers and also drawer space under tv cabinet. Lots of cupboard space under the windows to store luggage. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Would stay here again."
65,1120,"Aug 6 2008 	Great value and location.	A wonderful location in central London, a few minutes walk from Paddington Station which meant it only took us about 20 minutes to get there from Heathrow. Direct transport to major tourist destinations and close to Hyde Park for a stroll. Plenty of resturants and cafes in the area as well as mini-markets which was great as using the kitchenette cut downs costs immensley.We stayed in a standard one bedroom apartment which we found very comfortable and well equiped. The only problem was that there was no bedside lamp in the bedroom, meaning you have to get out of bed to switch the ceiling lamp on/off.We will definitely be staying here again."
66,1120,"Jul 16 2008 	great value accomodation	We had an apartment here for 4 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.The apartment we had was a studio, it was compact but comfortable with a small kitchenette.The was a lift so getting bags to room not a problem.There was no air-con but they supplied a fan. There was a guest lounge and bar.The location is fantastic not far from Paddington station, Hyde Park a short stroll away.Rooms were serviced everyday.Staff were helpful.We booked on-line and got this room for 59 pounds per night, i did book about 3-4 months out to get this price. We had a back room, no view but nice and quiet."
67,1120,"Jul 7 2008 	Great Value in London	After reading a lot of reviews of London hotels, as well as comparing prices, I chose the Royal Court Apartments because of their location close to Hyde Park and Paddington, as well as for the price. I booked directly with RCA and was able to book a studio for two for only 65 pounds per night, VAT included.I stayed at RCA for 5 nights before heading off to Bath for two nights, and then on to Harwich for a 12 night cruise on Jewel of the Seas. I also stayed at RCA in June for one night after the cruise.In May, I was given a newly refurbished room (509) complete with kitchen, mini-fridge, lovely bathroom, table and chairs, tv with four or five channels, double bed, and a wardrobe. The room has been decorated in the Ikea style, with new laminate floors, new kitchen cabinets, as well as a new bathroom with great new tiled shower, sink, toilet, tile floors- much more than you would expect after seeing some of the pictures taken by former guests in the older rooms. Also newly renovated, but sans kitchen, is room 507, for guests who want a lovely, (although smaller room), who do not need a kitchen or fridgeWhen we checked out of room 509, we asked if we could have the same room when we returned in two weeks. The lady at the desk put that information into the computer, and then we confirmed with her that we would have room 509 at a cost of 65 pounds for that additional night in June. However, when we did return, we found that room 509 was not available. The room have been occupied already by another guest. We were given room 404, not one of the newly renovated ones. Room 404 has two rooms, vs. 509's one large room, and the difference is striking. Room 404 has old carpet, old vinyl floors, and an old bathroom. At one point when we returned to the RCA and asked for our key to 404, we were told that the bathroom had a slight problem which was being fixed so we were told to wait in the lobby while the repairs were being done. We left to go sightseeing, and came back later. We we returned to our room, it smelled like chemicals, but the bathroom functioned properly.I enjoyed my stay at the RCA, and would highly recommend it. Hyde Park is only a couple of blocks away, and Paddington is only a few more. It is quite easy to walk to Paddington to shop for groceries at the two grocery stores there, as well as walk to internet cafes, shops, and restaurants. The bus is down the block, and you can catch the tube at either Paddington, or at nearby Lancaster Gate across the street from Hyde Park. You can't beat the price, and having a kitchen is a bonus. My only disappointment was not being able to stay in the room I had reserved ahead of time. We were told that next time we stayed there to ask for room 509, and ask that &quot;no sub&quot; be added to the reservation to ensure that 509 would be held for us. Makes me wonder why they couldn't have just done this in the first place. It does make me wonder what will happen the next around, however, I would stay here again regardless, I would be hard pressed to find a better deal in London for a budget hotel, and for a budget price than the RCA."
68,1120,"Jun 18 2008 	Plain convenient and nicely run	We, family of three, stayed in a one bedroom apt. with a dble bed and couch. Ordered a rollout bed but didnt use it as our 4 yr old slept on the couch. Bedroom has a strong rectanglular shape. Lots of space from end of the bed to the wall and the armoire, 6 or 7 ft, but only 1 foot from the walls on the side of the bed. Lots of light in the morning. WIndow right above head of bed and big window in living room. Bed was comfy. Bathroom worked well for us. Everything looked cleaned. Though the place was obviously older there was no detriment to our stay just to it's looks. TV recieved 4 stations, cartoons in the morning for our son. Kicthenette was very handy. Two burners. A pan, lots of plates and bowls, utensils, glasses, etc. Made breakfast everyday. Saved some money. Little grocer around the corner with fresh fruit, raisin bran, eggs, etc.. Lancaster Gate Underground is closer than Paddington underground by about 3 minutes walking. There is also a bus stop, Lancaster Gate, at the end of the same block as the hotel which makes for ease of transporting luggage. Hotel staff were all almost always friendly and attentive. I'd say 8 out 10 for that. Cons-Walls are a bit thin, as is flooring. Elevator is mad slow. Internet in room is expensive, $30 a day, but free wifi in the lobby.Staying here was hassle free and helped us enjoy our trip to London. Will certainly stay here again as the price was the best for the amount of space we wanted. Recommend a Sunday morn walk along Bayswater Rd. to see artists displaying work all along the sidewalk going towards Notting Hill market, which is also recommended. Reminds me of Central Park. Hyde park is a great place to get your walk/jog/run on."
69,1120,"Jun 17 2008	Not fancy but cheap	We stayed at the Royal Court Appartments for 3 nights from the 1st June 2008.Having read previous reviews i knew it was not going to be fancy and was half expecting to have to wear thongs in the shower. However i was surprised by the value for money and was exceptionally happy with the overall experience. Downstairs had been renovated - front desk, common lounge, bar and internet. All with new paint, furniture, flat screen tv's, wireless internet and more. It was very comfortable and quite a social area if you felt like a change from your room.The front staff were always helpful and pleasant. There are 2 elevators, which are slow and old but did the job. Our room was 310 on the third floor. It was certainly in need of a renovaton but i understand the building is currently undergoing refurbishment.We had a 1 bed appt, which was clean, comfortable enough, ample room for 2 people. It had a very small bathroom with a toilet, sink and a shower that leaked but not so bad as to flood the room. However it was clean and had good water pressure as well as plenty of hot water.We had 2 single beds, a wardrobe &amp; dresser. The beds were comfortable, clean and nice to sleep on.The appartment had laminate wood flooring, a small kitchenette, sofa, spare cot, TV, fridge, microwave, stove, sink and enough cooking utensils to make most meals if you want.The items in the kitchen were clean, well maintained and did the job. All plugs and utilities worked fine and were not falling appart or broken. Our attraction to stay at the royal court was the low price, kitchen &amp; central location, and for this we were not disappointed. In fact it exceeded our expectations, you cannot beat the location, the street is quite at night, but well lit, people still walking around and had a safe feeling.Paddington and Lancaster gate tube and train stations are only a few minutes walk and there is good bus connections as well. There is a sainsbury and M&amp;S in Paddington station if you want to grab food supplies to store in the appartment. Or there are many many cheap resturants to pick from in Paddington if you feel like eating out.The only other annoyance or criticism of the room we stayed in apart from the shower, was the fire alarm would briefly sound at various times during the day and early evening. Not sure why and i kept forgeting to ask the front desk. But it never woke us up at night so we didn't really care to much.Overally we would stay at the Royal Court Appartments again when we are in London."
70,1120,"Jun 15 2008	Fantastic value for money	I have stayed in a number of hotels in the Paddington area and have so far found this to be the best for our budget. It is located close to Paddington Station for the national rail service and 3 underground lines. Within 2 minutes walk is Lancaster Gate station for another option. Busses are also just moments away. The outside looks a little dated and the carpets in the rooms could do with a good clean. However, we paid a minimal 65 per night for a 1 bedroom apartment with a separate lounge and bedroom with cooking facilities including the fridge, microwave, toaster and cook top. Most would know that London can be quite costly... but you can save yourself a fortune by using this hotel. The staff were lovely and found we had no issues, having said that, we did witness a number of guests arguing with staff who were not willing to assist if they did have a small issue. This will be my hotel of choice from now on."
71,1120,"Jun 12 2008 	budget accomodation but suited us fine!	We booked to stay in London last weekend. We were going to see the foo fighters at wembley and decided to make a weekend of it.Booked Royal Court apartments through Alpha rooms and to be honest avoid alpha rooms as our experience with them wasnt good!We arrived on the thursday and stayed till the sunday and had a great break.On arrival the lovely receptionist informed us that she had no booking for us and that they had nothing from alpha rooms. However she kindly showed us to the lounge while she sorted it out. I think she felt for us and upgraded our room to one with a lounge and kitchen which was great. She advised that next time we book directly through them as we had over paid to alpha rooms by 90!Allof the reception staff are friendly.....bit clueless though about the local area and amenities in the hotel but lovely all the same.Our room was budget but clean and I think they are in the process of decorating all of the rooms as we peeped in at some which have been done and they were lovely. To be honest the room we were in needed updating.It was a nice firm bed and having a fridge in the room really helped as the weather was 26 degrees while we were there. It was lovely having a small sofa to crash on and relax after a day of sight seeing.We would definately stay here again and its only 70 per room per night if you go direct to the hotel.Its a short walking distance to Lancaster gate tube which is on the central line so accessible to all parts of London. At the bottom of the road is the entrance to hyde park which was great to walk round and see the fountains. In the opposite direction from the hotel is a short walk to Paddington station/tube stop and lots of shops and just at the top of the road from the hotel are a few little grocery shops (Nisa and some local owned ones) where can get milk, drinks and whatever else need.There are also various restaurants near to the hotel although we tended to eat while we were out so never really tried any.I'm guessing if you are off to London and use your hotel purely as a base this hotel is a must. The main things for me was it was clean, the staff were pleasant and the bed was comfy! What more do you need!"
72,1120,"Jun 10 2008 	Don't expect too much.	Upon arrival at RCA after a long flight we were told there was no booking, eventhough I had booked directly via email with the hotel three months prior and re-confirmed by email one week before arrival, advising arrival time etc. They did, to their credit, find us a room which we were told was a &quot;superior 1 bedroom apartment&quot; and we had apperently booked a &quot;standard 1 bedroom apartment&quot;, so we were &quot;upgraded&quot;. All I can say is that if that was &quot;superior&quot; I'd hate to see &quot;standard&quot;. After reading a lot of mixed reviews on TA was prepared for some basic accommodation, however, broken windows that do not close, let along lock, the shower screen over the bath swings 180 degress with nothing to hold it in place so water floods the floor every time you shower. The kitchenette was adequate, however, plug did not fit the sink so couldn't do dishes. The staff were friendly, but most lacked any local knowledge and were unable to assist with even minor requests. RCA is, however, located very conveniently to Paddington station, Hyde Park and a few okay eateries, small supermarkets and fruit shops for supplies. It was really convenient to have a kitchen and separate sitting area, however, I'd probably not stay there again. RCA really needs some renovationing to bring it up to scratch."
73,1120,"Jun 9 2008 	Handy and Convenient	The hotel is a 5min walk from Paddington station (handy for airport to and from) and 2mins from Lancaster Gate on the Central Line (handy for day to day travelling).I checked in without an issue, into a one bedroom apartment, the place is dated (but pretty much what you expect from London, except cleaner) although whatever chemicals they use on the carpets leave a tremendously noxious fumey smell that i found to make me ill on the first night but luckily they must only use it before a new guest, after a day or two of leaving the windows open it faded, not sure how things would be in winter.It was a bit annoying to have to leave the key at the desk every time i left, but easy enough as the front desk was always well staffed. I think they may be updating some of the rooms bit by bit as there was work going on in a room across the hall from me and there were trucks leaving with old furniture outside, so i believe the place will be getting updated more in the future.It was clean, convenient and good value for money. London is incredibly expensive no matter what level of accomodation you stay at, so at least having the little kitchenette to prepare your own meal makes things better and there was lots of space compared to most rooms you'd get there, it really made a difference when being there for over a week."
74,1120,"Jun 8 2008 	What a dump! Won't stay here again	This place was a total dump even by London standards. It is close to things--the only positive. The television had rabbit ears and not a single station came in clearly. My shower leaked into the room below, so they had to keep coming to my room to attempt to fix it. My closet door fell off the second day and was not fixed. They tried to get me to use their internet, but finally did tell me where an internet cafe was located. There is no bar, no restaurant. Nothing. Never again will I stay here."
75,1120,"Jun 8 2008 	High Highs Low Lows at RCA	Before I came to the hotel, I was very confused by the reviews written on this site - some were great, and some were terrible. But when I got there, it all started to make sense. Because of the renovations, there are parts of the building that are fine - but....if you get stuck in an unrenovated room...not so great. Here were our observations:Pros: Good prices; Great location near Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations for easy access to Central, Circle and District lines; Nice location next to Hyde Park for morning or evening strolls through the fountain and garden areas; Very polite, accomodating staff; Great money-saver to have kitchen, in light of dining being so expensive in London, especially with the terrible exchange rate of the dollar; Housekeeping was friendly and trustworthy with valuables in room; Higher floors on the back of the building are much quieter and have nice views; Beautiful refurbished lobby and sitting area with large flatscreen TV; Nice computers in lobby for finding walking directions, restaurant reviews, etc; In room TVs had clear pictures with four or five available channels. Cons: The rooms that have not yet been refurbished are very, very shabby. We had to decline our first room (room 60) because it was so, so awful - and I challenge anyone that thinks that I'm being too picky to ask to see it upon their arrival - it is truly a hovel. The shower isnt even in the bathroom - it's down a long scary foot-and-a-half wide hallway next to the front door. Our final room was still pretty shabby, but at least livable; Faulty wiring: every time we tried to turn on the stove, the fire alarm in our room turned on (which, while funny, was pretty disappointing since we thought we'd have a stove for the week); Bad plumbing: The toilet did not flush properly and leaked the entire week, even after maintenance's attempts to fix it; Terrifying elevators: They were working about half of our 8 days on the premisis - and when they were working, they shook and groaned so much that we never knew if we were going to get where we were going or not; Wireless internet connection: signal drops about every five minutes, causing too much frustration to even bother - if we were to do it again, we wouldnt even take the laptop and would just use the two pay-as-you-go computers in the lobby. So, as you can see, the experience, for us, was very mixed with high highs and low lows. The benefit of having an apartment with a kitchen was definitley worth all of the pain that we experienced - we wouldnt do London without one ever again. Bottom line was, for us, that if we could find another apartment in the same price range next time, we'd probably try it instead - if not, we'd stay at the RCA again. If you're going to stay at the RCA, here are our tips: If you find your room to be too warm, just ask the front desk for a standing fan - they do have them available. The Chinese restaurant up the street and around the corner to the left is great, and the M&amp;S and Sainsbury grocery stores in Paddington station are good places to stock up on groceries - just make sure first that the stove in your room works before you buy anything that can't be cooked in a microwave. There is a pharmacy and a church closeby as well. The nearby Swan Pub is a good place for a pint. We heard that the Victoria Pub was nice too."
76,1120,"May 25 2008 	Great staff great location	We stayed in 1 bedrm apartment in April 08. Staff were very helpful, allowed us in room earlier than check in time. Much appreciated after long exhausting flight from Singapore. While all rooms are dated, all is functional and clean. Beds comfortable and shower good. Location at Paddington is excellent, very central to all sites and tube."
77,1120,"May 19 2008	Best Value in London!	My fiancee and I arrived at the clean and very friendly 24-hour reception desk of the Royal Court Apartment hotel, and received a warm and hassle-free welcome despite the late hour at which we arrived. Then, when we saw the large, double, ensuite room we had booked, we almost couldn't believe they were giving us such a good price! The staff was respectful, the room was clean and comfortable, it was easily accessible from several Tube stop lines, and all appliances worked beautifully. When we returned from our stay, we saw that we had even received an email thanking us for our business. What a great hotel! We highly recommend it."
78,1120,"May 16 2008 	Budget in good Central London location	The location is excellent for tube and rail. If you are budget traveller but needs some privacy and service, this is the one of the best choices. They have friendly and helpful staff. convenient tube transportation, walking distance to Hyde Park and good grocery store, the Marks and Spencer and Stainbury for cooking needs at the Paddington Train Station.I love to eat homemade food and lots of fresh vegetable and friuit., my daughter and I really enjoy the stay.It's a bit old and dirty but still up to a livable standard withabove average overall at that price."
79,1120,"May 14 2008 	Not too bad	We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. The room was tired looking and the window in the kitchen/dine/lounge area didn't close. This wasn't too big of an issue as we like the fresh air.The lounge suite was grotty, I was too scared to sit on it, everything else was clean though.The toilet didn't flush very well, which was annoying and they forgot to give us sheets, blankets and towels for the 3rd guest.Not many of the staff spoke English, however, the reception staff did.One of the two elevators wasn't working for most 4 night stay, which slowed things down.The staff were helpful and the bar and waiting area seemed nice.I liked the fact that we could do our own cooking etc, so that saved money.The location was good, so that was a bonus.It was a cheap place to stay, but I am undecided as to whether I would stay there again."
80,1120,"Apr 18 2008 	Excellent 	I booked a one-night stay for 51 on the hotel's own website. This is possibly one of the cheapest places to stay in London, and one of the best if all you're looking for is a bed to sleep on.The room was great - we had a sofa, TV and table in the living room, a small kitchenette with 2 hob rings, a sink and a microwave. There was also a bathroom with a shower over the bath. It was by no means decorated to be chic and modern, but it does the job!The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's a 2 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube station and only a 10 minute walk from Oxford Street. Hyde Park is just beside the hotel, too.All in all, if you're looking for extreme comfort and will be spending a large amount of time in your room, don't go here. If, however, you're just looking a place to put your head at night, the RCA is the place to go!! I'll definitely be back."
81,1120,"Mar 17 2008	Excellent value	London isn't cheap and the kitchenette, although fairly basic, was great for preparing meals to save a few quid on food during my stay. I even managed a quick spag bol one night! The one-bedroom apartment was probably only slightly bigger than a regular hotel room but due to the layout it certainly felt like we had lots of space, we weren't tripping over our luggage or each other. The location is excellent, it is very central and easy to get to, but as most of London, just be careful at night. Only downside is that it is not plush or luxurious, but certainly comfortable and we felt right at home, therefore very good value."
82,1120,"Mar 12 2008 	Old but nothing to complain about	If you are looking for a great value, book here! Not many places in London can be found for ~$100 USD a night. Plus it's got a great staff who keeps things in order, very safe area near the beautiful Hyde Park, and a stones throw from a tube station. The space you get is huge. We had a studio double. The furniture/decor is very old, but everything is clean. Besides, you shouldn't be doing much other than sleeping in a hotel. The fridge and sink was nice so we could buy some groceries at a shop around the corner to save money/time on breakfast. Complaints: no auto wake up call system and no alarm clock (common in all of our Paris/London hotels). We had to catch a 5:25am train to Paris and the desk service didn't call us. They probably aren't used to checking the log at 4:00 am. Luckily they held a taxi for us. Also the windows were thin so we could hear cars going by and foot traffic. But it's a fairly quiet neighborhood."
83,1120,"Mar 12 2008 	Inexpensive Yet Fantastic!	We stayed at the RCA 13-19 June 2007 when we went over to see a couple of bands at Wembley Stadium and Wireless Festival and could not have been happier for the small amount of time we were actually in the room. If you're there to see the sights and don't care about staying in luxury, this is definitely the place for you. I'd really worried about the reviews I'd read previous to this, but we didn't have one problem with anything. The staff are pretty helpful, but don't ask to use their free safe deposit boxes (which they offer at check in!) or you're in for a stern lecture. The lounge is quite nice and the area is very safe to walk around in. Conveniently located by Lancaster Gate Tube Station and not too far from Paddington Station, either. The view of the city from the upper floors is beautiful, by the way!"
84,1120,"Mar 11 2008 	Great for a budget traveler	After having read a number of so-so reviews I was a little worried about my reservation for four nights around Christmas 2007. I shouldnt have been. The Royal Court is the perfect answer for budget travelers who want comfort and convenience in London without breaking the bank. Until there is a 180 degree shift in the exchange rate, Americans of modest means like me will find it very difficult to enjoy the city without spending a lot of time fretting about expenditures. The price of lodging isnt too bad compared to New York or San Francisco and a pint of excellent hand poured ale is no more than what youd pay at an upscale pub in the States but its really hard to stomach the idea of spending $20 for breakfast, $40 for lunch, and $75 and up for dinner, especially when few of these meals are going to be very memorable. Local fast food isnt the answer given than an order of mediocre fish and chips will run you $16 to $18. Thankfully the Royal Court provides the thrifty traveler with the means to avoid these horrific drains on the pocketbook. Our little kitchenette (a one-person-at-a-time space) was stocked enough for us to make eating out a pleasant decision and not a chore. We would fix a nice breakfast, pack a lunch of sandwiches and snacks to munch on between museums and parks, and go off for the day exploring until we returned for dinner. Our simple but nutritious meals provided enough fuel to go hit the pubs and clubs each night. When we did eat out, it was because we were intrigued by the menu or the ambiance, not solely because we were hungry. When you have that sort of option, dropping $200 for dinner at a nice restaurant doesnt hurt so bad, at least not until the credit card bills come in.The management does a nice job with providing the basics for cooking and apartment living. We had a roll of paper towels, dishwashing soap, coffee and tea basics, pots, pans, cutlery, glasses, towels and sponges, etc etc. About two blocks away is a small store that is surprisingly well stocked for its size and provided all that we needed to make tasty meals. With some butter, pasta, a ton of fresh veggies, and wine, we could whip up a far better dinner than anywhere in the neighborhood. Add a dozen eggs, sausages, fruit, and bread and we had breakfast covered. The only thing we brought with us were a handful of those little salt and pepper servings we snatched up at a burger joint at the airport.The neighborhood is quiet, surprisingly so for London. This is residential area, not a tourist ghetto like Covent Gardens and similar sections of the city, and by 8pm things have quieted down considerably. Very safe though. There are a couple of good pubs nearby (the Victoria, for example, is brilliant) and you are equidistant between the Central line Tube and the transportation hub at Paddington. Lots of busses run just a block away. The rooms are old, far older than most hotels you are likely to stay at anywhere, but they are clean (if very plain) and roomy. It was really nice to have a separate room for the bed. The electronic safe was a welcome surprise. The heater cooked (this was December) but we also had a standup fan. The staff was pretty friendly, far more so than I expected. I didnt use it but I did see guests in the lobby hooking up via a wireless connection. I dont know what these one bed room apartments (which is what we had) go for normally but the Hotels.com price was extremely reasonable, especially in comparison to other lodging choice in the city. Overall this is good value if you arent looking for something modern and charming but rather just needed a solid base of operations to explore London economically. Id stay there again in a heartbeat.Nick P., Malibu"
85,1120,"Mar 7 2008 	Little Money and a Lot of Space	Now this isn't a four star luxury hotel but if you want a reasonable place to stay for a very decent price in a convienent London location, it's a good bet. We got a good deal, and with an coupon did even better, though I would recommend checking the hotel's website because the prices seemed even better there. We spent about $100 a night for what in London (or NYC for that matter) would pass for a palatial flat. There was a bedroom with two twin beds, a full ensuite bath, a kitchen with stove top, microwave and medium sized fridge, kitchen table with four chairs, tv and couch. There was also a cot, had there been more of us. Nothing was new but everything was clean.There was a very nice lounge downstairs, with free wifi, and a bar, though the bar wasn't open during our visit. It's perhaps a five minute walk from Paddington rail and tube stations. My only complaint is that they hold the room keys at the desk when you go out and don't seem to ask for much in the way ID before they hand them over.Having the kitchen facilities can help you save money during your trip. Try picking up premade foods that can be nuked in the microwave from the Marks and Spenser's in Paddington station. If you've got some time on Friday or Saturday go over to Borough Market (it's near the London Bridge tube stop) and buy some premade pies at the Pieminster. They were fabulous, especially with M&amp;S mash potatoes on the side."
86,1120,"Feb 26 2008 	Great little room with kitchenette and wifi	I stayed in a single from Feb 1 through Feb 6 and am very satisfied with the hotel. As others have stated it is only a few minutes walk from Paddington station and Lancaster Gate, which is across the street from Hyde Park. The lobby area is clean and stylish and I found the staff extremely friendly (even the maintenance guy). I arrived at 10am and since my room was ready they let me check in. The room, as with most tourist class hotels, was small but had room for two chairs to sit comfortably at the table. The kitchenette was well stocked with supplies and everything worked fine. The bathroom was not as small as I was expecting and had a full tub with shower which had great water pressure and no lack of hot water. The room was kept very clean by the attentive staff. The TV received 4 or 5 channels and worked fine. I was on the second floor streetside and traffic noise was noticeable but didn't bother too much at night. I paid $70US per night through hotel's web site. I'll certainly stay here again. And I'll definitely never stay in London without a kitchenette ever again. Saved lots of money by not having to eat out constantly! Frosted Flakes and macaroni may not be the most British of meals but at least it was cheap. And the free wifi worked great in my room on my iPod Touch. To sum up, convenient and quiet location, clean and comfortable room and a price that's hard to beat."
87,1120,"Feb 24 2008	Excellent budget option great location	I just returned home to New York after a week's stay at the RCA. The hotel absolutely met my expectations. The room was clean, it was quiet, and everything in the kitchen worked. The place is currently being renovated (a good move!) so some parts of the building are considerably shabbier than others, but regardless, this is the perfect place for a family or group of friends. The location is convenient and the price is right."
88,1120,"Feb 16 2008 	Good location good price	We decided to try this apt/ hotel as a budget intro to preChristmas London, on a 6 week jaunt from Oz, thru UK, Italy and South Africa. We stayed in Bayswater at the Pheonix in 2005 and liked it. The RCA has the advantages of self catering; stayed 5 days in a one br apartmentt. Liked: easy transit from LHR(use the Heathrow Connect, not the expensive Heathrow Express); groceries at Sainsburys at Paddington Station, a 5 minute walk; big enough certainly for 2; small kitchenette with TV, microwave, hotplate, utensils and fridge, clean and friendly reception and cleaning staff, shops at the top of the street. great direct access to city by Lancaster Gate tube (3 mins walk). Yes, it's not what some (particularly novice American travellers) expect. It's a little down at the heel but I prefer spending my money on afternoon tea at the Ritz to sleeping obliviously in a 5 star. Free WIFI on my laptop in the lounge. We have travelled for 30 yrs on all continents and would certainly consider this one again."
89,1120,"Feb 14 2008 	good price good location	stayed in this apt for 5 days in september. it is the perfect place for the budget travellers. it is convenietly located and with friendly helpful staff (and this one blonde boy is yummy lol). its close to both paddington station if youre taking the heathrow express and lancaster tube station, which is cheaper but takes a little longer - if youre not in a rush take the tube, either from or to LHR airport, to see the outside london. the room was clean and spacious and equipped with the basics - microwave, electric pot (for instant coffees) and a few cooking pans, plates and utensils. the hotel is a few blocks from a couple of restaurants, grocery, postoffice, bank, souvenir store, coffee shop and the BIG BUS tour stop. they were fixing up the lobby when we were there and i think theres wifi too. everything was ok except for those squeaky floor.the staff are helpful and always smiling. they give good directions for places to see, just make sure you tell them what you want to see. im not sure they know all the tourist spots since theyre all locals and they had to make a copy of my list of &quot;sights to see.&quot;ill be staying in this hotel again next time i do london...and the boy."
90,1120,"Jan 7 2008	No luxuries but clean 	The hotel is dated in style and fairly basic but I found it clean and adequate for my needs. It is very convenient.Reading earlier reviews, I was concerned that room would be very small and not very clean; and staff unhelpful. That was not my experience. May be some other reviewers are expecting a modern motel or chain-hotel style facility but in my experience, most budget hotels in large European cities are not in that style but rather are older with smaller rooms, narrow hallways, small lifts and old fittings (showers, etc). RCA is just like many other budget hotels in central London.I found the room basic and not too cramped; the beds were firm but OK. The apartment consisted of a bedroom (4m x 3m), a small gallery kitchenette (cooker, microwave, kettle, basic utensils) and a good sized shower/toilet. Everything was clean and worked. Like most hotels in London, language issues can arise so you need to be patient and giive them a chance. I found the staff on reception helpful and polite.The location is very convenient. Paddington station and the Lancaster Gate tube station are a few minutes walk away and there also lots of buses. There are also some nice and reasonably-priced restaurants, pubs and convenience stores nearby. If you want a base for visiting London at a budget price, RCA is it. If you are looking for comfort and elegant surroundings, you elsewhere and pay for it!"
91,1120,"Jan 4 2008 	Convenient but shabby	After 5 weeks travelling through Europe and staying in a variety of accommodation we were not sure how we would find the Royal Court Apartments. We were warned by the reviews that it would be shabby but clean and this indeed was how we found it. The difficulty in assessing hotel accommodation is that it is a balance between cost/convenience/expectation/realism. We know London is expensive and we'd rather save on the accommodation and meals and see more of the sights. This we achieved but it did stretch our tolerance for the down at heel nature of the hotel. A couple of nights we'd have found tolerable but by the fifth night we couldn't wait to leave - we'd had enough of the scruffiness and a bathroom that was so small you had to step outside just to change your mind. But having said that, it is a very convenient location, the staff were nothing ever than polite and helpful and the rooms basically clean. Our only complaint was that our apartment backed onto an internal shaft at the bottom of which was the staff amenities room from which loud music/television did not make for a quiet location. We wouldn't stay again but this is a reflection more of what we're prepared to accept as a standard of comfort rather than a fault of the hotel as it doesn't purport to be anything other than it is."
92,1120,"Dec 9 2007 	Perfect stay for less money	It was my second stay in this hotel an it will not be the last. Im planing the next trip to london next year and I already know where Ill stay. Whenever Ive been there the staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms where clean, cosy and not to small like in other hotels in London. And the location of the hotel ist superb to reach the main points in London by tube or by bus - or even by going. So I can recommend this hotel to all who want to stay in London"
93,1120,"Nov 30 2007 	Royal Court Apartments Were quite ok!	We stayed at the Royal Court Apartments for 4 days in september, when we arrived we were greeted by a pleasent gentleman at the front desk, the room was a little warn and the bathroom could have used some finishing off just filling of holes and gaps around the bath. The kitchen facilities came in handy for a quick breakfast or snacks and drinks to have after a day of sightseeing. The wireless internet was very good and made it easy to keep in touch with people at home. The only negative is handing your key in when you leave just made us feel a little exposed in terms of security. However great hotel if you are on a budget."
94,1120,"Nov 22 2007 	Very Good London Budget Hotel	We'll be checking out of the Royal Court Apartments tomorrow morning, after 4 nights, so I suppose something could still go wrong but, so far, this has been a fine place to stay in comparison with other budget hotels we've stayed at in Europe.We booked through United Airlines at the rate of $107/night for a &quot;one bedroom studio.&quot; When we checked in, we were given a one bedroom apartment, so we have a bedroom and a separate kitchen/living room, each of which is larger than most of the budget European hotel rooms in which we've stayed previously. The bathroom is typical for London, although the very tall bathtub sides do make climbing in and out somewhat of a challenge.The staff is very attentive and helpful! We had a problem with a loose shower head the first morning, reported it to the front desk as we left that morning and, when we returned a couple hours later, they asked if the repair was sufficient. (It was!) And, while not all of the housekeeping staff may have English as their first language (see previous reviews), we could not have asked for a friendlier or more helpful attitude from them.Some would characterize the decor as &quot;worn&quot; but, in our experience, no moreso than most of the places we've stayed in London (Royal National, Tavistock, President, Balmoral). And any of those hotels would have cost more than twice what we've paid here this week. Our philosophy is that if the hotel room is clean, well maintained and we have enough room to put our luggage on the floor, we'll use the money saved for other London adventures, and the RCA has more than met that expectation, especially with all of the space we have.The only concerns we have include poor lighting for reading (bring a portable booklight if you're going to read much in your room) and fact that, even in November, the apartment is warmer than we like for sleeping so that we leave the windows cracked and it gets a little noisy in the morning. (We're on the streetside.) As others have noted, the TV is not cable or satellite quality, but we've managed to stay tuned to both CNN and the British news channels, even though they may be a little fuzzy.Otherwise, location is good for getting around London, the presence of a kitchen unit including a refrigerator, dishes, microwave and hot water pot for coffee has been great, the wireless internet leaks effectively from the ground floor to our first floor apartment so that we've been connected very well the entire time we've been here and, again, we've never had this much space at such a reasonable price (or any price) on any of our previous trips to Europe.It's not the Mariott or the Omni in America but our employers aren't paying for this trip, and, at this price, it's been an excellent value!"
95,1120,"Nov 3 2007 	Not for Travellers seeking Luxury and Calm	I stayed at the Royal Court Apartments for three nights in October 2007, having booked it via the Ryanair website as a special offer. I had requested a quiet room, being a light sleeper. When I arrived, I was handed the key to a room which was surrounded by an interior building site. I complained and was immediately given an alternative room with an ensuite kitchenette, as I had orginally booked it. It was supposed to be a double room (studio) but was cramped even for a single traveller. For two people, I suppose that the apartments are a better choice in terms of size. All the windows facing the road are single glazing which lets in a lot of noise. The beds are comfortable and my room was clean but slightly shabby. A small bathroom sported a bathtub with shower nozzle, plenty of hot water and was also clean. I was given fresh towels very day. The kitchenette is a real bonus if you do not want to pay extortionate London prices for eating out. There are plenty of small shops and supermarkets within a few minutes walk.The hotel is undergoing a refurbishing at present which means that there is a lot of rubbish piled up outside the hotel (including old fridges and kitchen fittings) which is very offputting. Inside the hotel, the lobby and reception area are clean, freshly painted and the staff is polite and helpful. I am sure that once the reconstruction is over, the place will be perfectly acceptable to stay in. Another bonus is the proximity to the bus stop at Lancaster Gate, the tube station Lancaster Gate as well as Paddington Station."
96,1120,"Sep 11 2007 	Excellent Location	We stayed at Royal Court Apartments from Sept 2 - Sept 8.Location :: The Apartments are convinently located from Paddington Station. Take a train [ Heathrow Express / Heathrow connect] from Heathrow Aiprort to Paddington station. When you exit the station, turn Right and walk towards Gloucester Terrace. Turn Left and walk for 2 mins. You would see a blue canopy. Lancaster Gate Tube stations is about 2 mins. Lancaster Gate Bus stop is also about 2 mins. From each of this stops, you can connect to any part of London via Tube/BusHyde Park is about 2 mins. Very near to the hotel is Hyde Park which is very beautiful. Cross the Park [ 10 mins walk] to Kengiston Garden and Kengiston Palace. There are many small neighborhood grocery stores, or near Paddington rail station there are larger stores such as Sainsbury Local. It was a very safe location. Hotel Staff::We arrived early around 9 AM. Check in is usually at 3 PM. But Staff accomodated us and got the room ready in 1 hr. We waited in the lobby. Lobby is clean. WiFi access is available in lobbyCheck in was quick and staff very helpful. They provided us information, travel bits. There was always someone at receptionRoomRoom was clean. It has a double bed. Kitchen had all the utensils [microwave, fridge, table, chairs, cutlery, plates, pans]. We requested for more cups and plates and they provided us in 5 mins. We also requested for some more blankets and they were quick in getting those. Linens were changed daily and clean. Room was clean efficiently every dayWe stocked the fridge with essentials. There is Sainsbury at Paddington Station. There are also a couple of Internet cafes on the way to Paddington tube and train station which are relatively inexpensive and convenient. At Paddington there is a grocery store that has all the essentials if needed.Tour :: [--]"
97,1120,"Sep 4 2007	Loved It	I stayed here with my 2 sons (11 and 13) for 6 nights in June, 2007. The hotel was easy to find and very central. The room was a little home away from home and we relaxed straight away. The 1 bedroom apartment had 2 singles and a rollaway in the lounge, all quite comfortable. We mainly used the kitchen for breakfast and lunch so the fridge came in very handy. There was a Sainsburys at Paddington Station along with quite a few other shops. There was also an internet cafe just around the corner in a newsagents. There were some reasonably priced restaurants within 5 mins walking distance of the hotel. The train service was easy to use and quite cheap to buy a daily ticket for the 3 of us. I felt very secure which was very important when travelling with kids. The hotel was 2 mins walk from Paddington Station in one direction and Hyde Park in the other. The kids loved it. If you are coming to London for the sights and experience and don't mind an older style, yet quite comfortable, accommodation this is perfect and an excellent price. It was a perfect beginning to our trip to the UK."
98,1120,"Aug 6 2007 	great value	For the money it was a great place. We cooked all of our meals in the cozy kitchen. The one bedroom was very roomy for 2 people (double bed and a twin bed). Bathroom was cozy and odd but we did not run out of hot water and had fresh towels daily. Kitchen was small and lacked drinking glasses but had wine glasses, had a nice table and 3 chairs! Living room had a love seat , chair and a tv with a few stations. Ask for a room in the back the street noise could be a problem.Room was clean and staff was helpfull. We felt safe! We will stay here again."
99,1120,"Jul 28 2007	Just a bit scruffy for the price	The hotel staff was polite and gracious, but the room was a bit substandard for the price. The room was to have had two twin beds and a sleeper sofa, but had only the beds. The bedroom was cramped, and it took several hours for the staff to locate a folding bed. They really did try hard. The worst part of the stay was the mildew and sewer smell from the foyer and bathroom area. The carpet in front of the bathroom door had obviously been soaked repeatedly and allowed to mildew, causing my nose to run and eyes to burn. The staff honestly tried to clean the carpet, but the real cause was the shower, which had only a partial screen (at the wrong end!) and no curtain, allowing water to splash out of the tub area if you were not very, very careful. The staff offered to switch rooms, and in retrospect, we should have taken them up on their offer, assuming it was sincere.With respect to price, it was in range of other properties, and the general location was excellent. There did seem to be, however, a large number of other properties that we will explore on our next visit before we stay here again. One other point - the map provided on the web page was inaccurate - the Lancaster Gate Underground station is actually 1 block to the east on the map, and the location of the hotel is further to the northwest along Gloucester Terrace. Paddington Station is actually a little closer, offers better connections, and if one is traveling from Heathrow, take the Heathrow Connection all the way to Paddington Station."
100,1120,"Jul 23 2007 	Superb Staff - Great Neighbourhood	We chose this hotel because of the reviews and price (through Holiday Rooms, very efficient). The location is very convenient, just minutes from Lancaster Gate on the Central Line. Registration was quick and our Receptionist was adorable, helpful and competent. At all times we saw 2-3 people at Reception. From the reviews we expected our room to be more worn out, but were pleasantly surprised to find it very, very clean and as if just painted. Our room had a stand alone fan which was welcome as it was hot during our time in London and during the night. The kitchen had all the basic utensils (hob, microwave, fridge, sink, table, chairs, cutlery, plates, pans) to prepare a meal. Tin-opener and cork screw/bottle opener were missing. Though with the Colbeh Restaurant just a short walk away (Porchester Terracce), we did not bother eating in. There are loads of restaurants nearby, from pizza to chic.The hotel lounge was adequate. We heard that WiFi is provided and then the generous seats would be a pleasure while surfing the web. Unfortunately the floors in the corridors cracked and we could hear each step above us, though no voices.The next day I asked how to get to the Indian High Commissioner and Rupi, the Receptionist, had all the info printed out, a map prepared and how to get there plus...send to the room. Now, if this is not service, then I don't know what is!The staff were at all times nice, welcoming and ready to give 300%. Would we return? Certainly yes."
101,1120,"Jul 13 2007 	We loved our ""friends"" at The Royal Court Apartments!	Our experience at The Royal Court Apartments was wonderful. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated (updated). The location was a breeze to get around town. Nice, safe neighborhood. But the staff! What can we say? WE WERE TREATED LIKE ROYALTY! We had so much fun. Whenever we returned to the hotel, we were greated with such enthusiasm and kindness and when we left it was with good cheer. We especially loved Christiano who couldn't have been more concerned or treated us so wonderfully. Thanks! Margaret, Lynn, Dana &amp; Kayla from New York (everyone's favorite Americans!)"
102,1120,"Jul 12 2007 	Know what you are booking into	This &quot;hotel&quot; is a mixed bag. The location, near Paddington,is good for rail and the Heathrow Express; and within 100 yards there is Kensington Gardens and the Lancaster Gate tube station. Also the small kitchen facilties would probably be welcome.The place itself is pretty scruffy in the corridors and rooms although the bedlinen was clean. Much of the fittings in our room needed reapir and the TV needed tuning or replacement.We booked in advance a double at 65 room-only (surely you could stayat a Travelodge for the same?) and paid 50 deposit. However when paying the balance they tried to get a further 24 from me, and I refused.Also we saw someone get a walk-in rate of185, which even for London seemed a lot for a place like this. We also overheard a family checking out, settling their bill and asking for a discount on account of &quot;the rats&quot;"
103,1120,"Jun 28 2007 	Great location!	This was our first London hotel and it had plenty of room for the two of us. It is not a luxury hotel by US standards, but we were looking for a place to crash after taking in as many of the London sights and attractions as possible in the 5 days we were there. This really filled the bill! The bath was small, as expected, and so was the bedroom, but the beds (we had 2 twins) were exceptionally comfortable and the whole place was clean with daily cleaning service. There were fresh towels and the bedding was changed daily. The big advantage is that there was another room with a small refrigerator and microwave so we could store milk, juice, ham, cheese, etc. for breakfast and small meals and picnics in very nearby Hyde Park. This was a huge savings because London is extremely expensive. We also used this room to store our empty suitcases since the bedroom was small. We made several local phone calls for various types of information and they were free. There are also a couple of Internet cafes on the way to Paddington tube and train station which are relatively inexpensive and convenient. At Paddington there is a grocery store that has all the essentials if needed. The hotel staff is happy to help, but English is not their first language. For most questions, however, they can look up info on the Internet, print it out and give it to you. They were happy to help in this way every time. It is in a safe neighborhood and VERY conveniently located near 2 different subway (tube) lines (Leicaster Square- at the gate of Hyde Park, and Paddington) as well as Paddington Train Station. Getting almost anywhere is Central London was a breeze. We would definitely return to this hotel!"
104,1120,"Jun 13 2007 	Perfect Location for the Single Traveler	During my 8-day London visit in March of 2007, I found the Royal Court Apartments extremely affordable, perfectly located, comfortable, and very very quaint. I booked it via Expedia as their rate was slightly better than the other on-line competitors. Many London mid-range priced hotels do not have full kitchenettes that include fridges, and that was one of the main attractions and selling points for me, having a fridge, a gas/electric stove. The Kitchenette was stocked with glasses, plates, silverware, pots, pans, knives, and a myraid of other essential kitchen ammenities for the active homecook. Its much cheaper to purchase groceries/ales/water/PRET sandwiches, etc than to eat out regularly. My room was on the fourth floor facing Gloucester Terrace, and the noise level was not that bad and I am a somewhat light sleeper when abroad. The room was quaint, slightly outdated by 20 years, but not in a bad way. I was not expecting four star living space, but rather a safe, comfortable and affordable location in a a very expensive UK city. The bedding was always clean, the beds were firm, the bathroom was decent sized even for someone like myself who is 6'4&quot;. Water-pressure was unusually strong for being on the 4th floor of an old converted victorian housing/building structure. I was not staying in London to complain about the hotel carpeting, the floral-patterned wall-paper, the weak TV reception (at about 9pm several channels begin all German Language programming so be prepared for this :), the awkward stairwells and inter-connecting/uneven hallways, etc, I wanted to save money on the living actual arrangements and spend carefully in other areas which Royal Court Apartments allows you to do.Perfectly located near Paddington Station and about 45 seconds from Lancaster Gate Tube, RCA also had a convienent night bus that takes you from LG to Islington with few stops inbetween. Its about a 15 minute walk to Oxford Street via Bayswater which runs parallel to Hyde Park (also about 1 minute from the RCA). Portobello Road is just a tube stop in the other direction heading west, and was nice to get over that way as well for the weekend street fair.Lastly, I found the staff /front counter staff friendly and helpful. Please understand that Brit counter staff will be different from NYC counter staff, and it nothing personal against the traveller, its a minor cultural difference so travellers must understand this and not take offense if the staff are not gushing with visible love and affection. They are doing their jobs and working hard for the hotel and the people they service day in and day out. I strongly recommend The Royal Court Apartments on Gloucester Terrace based on the money you will save, the convienence of location in a big city, and the good living and comfortable atmosphere you will engage staying there."
105,1120,"May 18 2007 	Perfect for our needs	My daughter and I booked a studio apartment for 6 nights. Although lidt worn out by use, the place was really just perfect for us. We've tried other reasonable priced hotels and hostels in London, but this is our favourite.Location is just fine, 5 minutes walk to Lancaster Gate Tubestation and Hyde Park. If the weather is good, one can walk through the park in 10 to 15 minutes and be at Marble Arch and Oxford Street. The room was clean, and the cleaning beyond reproach!! Clean towels everyday and the staff was very helpful.This is OUR place in London in future, providing of course we can book at a reasonable price."
106,1120,"May 16 2007 	Great for travelers on a budget.	My husband and I stayed at the Royal Court Apartments for 4 nights. The &quot;hotel&quot; appealed to us because it had a kitchenette and we knew that this would save us a ton of money.I must distinguish the difference between run-down and dirty. This hotel was very clean. To some, it may not have appeared this way because it was run-down - the furnishings,carpet, wall-paper, etc. were very old. The cleaning staff did an excellent job and I could not be happier. The kitchenette in our room had a small and a large sauce pan, frying pan, cooking prep materials, a microwave, two burners, a small oven, papertowels, dish soap, a small fridge - anything you would need to do basic cooking.The hotel offers free wireless internet access from their lounge. The lounge is quite nice and people do sit there with their laptops browsing the net, however, since our room was on the street level and near the lounge, we were able to access the internet from our room which was FANTASTIC! There was a TV in our room with all of the BBC channels and two german channels. The bathroom was basic, but suited our needs.The closest tube stop is Lancaster Gate. The closest after Lancaster Gate is Paddington. Very near to the hotel is Hyde Park which is very beautiful. There are many small neighborhood grocery stores, or near Paddington rail station there are larger stores such as Sainsbury Local. The staff were very pleasant. I was pleased with our overall encounter will all staff members. Note - Get an oyster card for tube travel! This is by far the cheapest way to travel as it offers a reduced rate to the paper tickets and if you travel only in Zone 1, you pay a max of 4.60 pounds per day. You can purchase the card from almost any tube or rail station and many local stores sell them as well. There is a 3 pound deposit on the card which is returned to you when you turn in your card upon departure."
107,1120,"Apr 18 2007 	Two for Two!	Hey All,Oranjeboom here. I wrote a review of the Royal Court same time last year, based on my first experience staying there. As promised, I am here to write another review(though I am not sure how long-winded it will be. Stay Tuned!).To begin, I was a little worried that we would have a &quot;studio&quot; as opposed to the &quot;apartment&quot; we had first time around. We being me and my newly married wife. For those of you keeping score at home, she stayed there with me last year, only as my girlfriend. Please don't alert the Vatican............I have to say that I was very relieved to find that our &quot;studio&quot;, while small, was on the top floor(last year's &quot;apartment&quot; was on the first floor, on the inner part of the building, so we didn't have a view), giving us a view of the buildings between us and Hyde Park. There was an old church with a steeple that features in many of our photos. For the first few days, it seemed like we had the entire top floor to ourselves. Midweek(we stayed for 10 days), Mom and Dad and their 3 kids came noisily up the stairs and used the hallway as an indoor track facility. I was tempted to yell out the door like an angry old man bellowing &quot;GET OUTTAHH MY YAHHHHD&quot;, but I, with the help of my new wife, managed to keep myself under control. I guess these events could be filed under &quot;luck of the draw&quot;.As pointed out in my first review, the place is near two tube stations, which individually give you access to most areas and lines in London. We had no problem getting around at all. This is definitely a big plus for the Royal Court, since the Paddington area itself(other than Hyde Park), is pretty lame. If you are in search of nightlife, you better plan your evenings well, since many of the tube lines stop around Midnight, and you don't want to get stuck taking a Black Cab home. We missed the last train of the night by inches one night, and coughed up 25 to get home via Black Cab. If you don't know what the current exchange rate is between the USA and merry old England, it's 2 to 1(dollars to pounds), so it was 50 bucks! Tip to London travellers: Buy Oyster Cards if you are there for an extended stay. It will save you big bucks over individual tube fares!Staff was pretty cool as they were last year, with one guy being especially friendly. I took advantage of their &quot;safe deposit box&quot; to leave my iPod and American dough. No problems. The housekeeping staff is very good, although I think some of the older staff look at you while wishing you die a fiery death. How can I sum it up? I love it and it suits me fine. We had friends get us a room here in Chicago over last weekend as a wedding present at the Hyatt in downtown, and although I was very grateful for the gift, I couldn't see what the point was of blowing so much money on a place to sleep and shower. You could use that money to do so many other things.If you are at all like me, and just want a functional place to go home to at the end of a day of roaming around, the RCA is your place. The local Sainsbury's(in Paddington station), works well with the built in kitchenette to save you big money on eating out(not to mention beer and cider!) Buy up all the beans, Stilton cheese(88p!!!) and Kingsmill bread you can carry and you will never go hungry.If you are looking for a place to bolster your social status, or are, as described in my earlier review, a &quot;dainty traveller&quot;, this is not the place for you.Travel accomadations are, at best, a very subjective affair, so assess what your intentions are well before choosing the Royal Court as your port of call. If you want a very affordable(in ultra-expensive London, this place is a steal) place to stay, that is clean and comfortable, without frills, this is your place. If you are looking to prop yourself up with room service, and brag to your in-laws about the lavish accomodations you had on your trip to London, you might want to look elsewhere. I have stayed here twice, and can't think of a better place for me to stay in London. If I plan on booking another London trip down the road, the Royal Court will definitely be my first choice.I hope that all of you that choose the RCA for your London stay will enjoy this great city as much as I have over the last two visits. Be safe, and enjoy!Oranjeboom!"
108,1120,"Jan 25 2007 	Basic but nice	Arrived to the hotel at 1.30 a.m. on the 20th of January. The reception area was very nice and you could see that they had it renovated as it was bright and looking nice. The receptionist was very swift and the check-in was smooth. We were shown to our room on the ground floor (nr. 57). Our room was not renovated as we could se from the stains on the wall paper and the uneven floors. The floors had carpet in every room except for the bath rooms The bathrooms were not very big, you could just be one person at a time in there. Our double room consisted of a hallway leading to one bedroom with a double bed, 140 cm wide. Ensuite bathroom with shower. In the other direction we found a toilet and a shower, living room with kitchen and a TV. The bed was very firm, not to my liking at all. I woke up several times during the nights because it hurt so much. My husband on the other hand liked it being so firm.All the basic cooking equipment was there. Although we could have needed a tea towel, cutting board, frying pan and corkscrew.The TV-channels were not so many and we couldnt get a sharp picture in any of them.The morning after we had slept the first nigt we discovered that we had only been given one very small towel each. We complained about this and after that we had two fresh towels each every day.Another good thing was that our room was very quiet. We didnt hear any traffic at all during our stay.It was also very near to the tube, Lancaster Gate was just a few mnutes walk and as its on the Central Line you reached Oxford Street very fast.We would recommend this hotel to anyone who dont expect nothing but a clean basic apartment hotel near the city."
109,1120,"Jan 19 2007 	was ok	staying in this Royal Court Apartment for 3 nights from 11th Jan on. it is my first visit to London so I have no reference point to compare, however the money that I paid for this place is very much good enough to have a nice B&amp;B in continental europe so I can only say that London's expensive. I stayed on 3rd floor, bedroom is clean, but the floor is somehow thin and uneven in the corridor, we can hear the room above very clearly whenever someone's walking around. our bathroom is acceptable clean except the first day when we arrived (can see hair from previous guests), really small, everything packed in the bathroom. Shower not good. It is true that it is very closed to a lot other facilities esp. tube station and options for cheap eating, also bus directly to oxford street etc. A morning stroll in nearby park was also pleasant. I guess I shouldn't complain too much for the money I paid, only want to say that you can save a lot of money for decent hotels in order to plan for full evening activities (theatres, cines, restaurants and heaps of pubs), which was exactly what we did."
110,1120,"Dec 20 2006 	Clean Friendly Excellent Value for Money!	GOOD POINTSClean and tidyCooking Facilities in the roomFriendly StaffGreat Location (next to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube)BAD POINTSSome might consider it a dated dcorNo in-house restaurant (but cooking facilities in room and next door to a wonderful neighbourhood of an eclectic selection of cafs and restaurants).I normally use Priceline when booking Hotels (unless I need something specific) as they generally use quality hotels, you grab a bargain and I love that extra element of surprise. Anyway, I wasnt able to secure anything cheaply as it seemed most of London was fully booked, not unusual for Christmas time.Anyway, Im not usually one to pay over the odds on Hotels as I generally find if they are clean and tidy theres not much in difference, and Id rather pocket the difference than pay a small fortune to walk through a plush lobby.I found this Hotel through [----] and only paid 50 for the night and went by some reviews from this website, I wasnt sure what to make of the reviews as they were either very good or quite poor, but not as bad as some other Hotels in this price brand.The Hotel market themselves as an apartment hotel and whilst I didnt use them, they have a small cooker, microwave, sink, etc., in the room. I would imagine it would come in extremely useful if you are staying here for a week, where you could cook yourself a quick snack or breakfast than use the otherwise overpriced and often terrible hotel restaurants. I found the rooms incredibly clean with even a reassuring smell of cleaning products and although whilst the dcor was somewhat dated and rooms small-ish (something that you expect for London, although the hotel does have a range of larger rooms for more people) it was a pleasant experience, walking distance to both Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube, excellent value for money with friendly staff to boot!"
111,1120,"Nov 23 2006 	Good value	Stayed at theRoyal Court Apartments for 4 days, good proce and very conveniently located for Paddington Station and lots of shops and resturants closeStaff very friendly and helpful, and the room tarriff was very reasonableRooms are a little bit tatty and run down but nothing that detracts too much from the convenience and value for money"
112,1120,"Oct 25 2006 	Great location	Basic but perfectly adequate tourist hotel in good location- 10 mins walk to the Paddington tube station. Reception staff were polite and organised minor repairs (light globes, unlocking the safe) in an efficient manner. The 1 br suite was quiet and clean but the decor was very tired. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom compact but ok. We stayed for 7 nights and were able to cook meals in the kitchenette which had basic utensils etc. Not bad value for money for London- 2 star but would stay here again."
113,1120,"Oct 4 2006 	Better that I'd expected	I was 4 nights there, and I was so nice, not rats, not buts, nothing strange. Just 1 thing, never more Ill read any reviews for any hotel( things that for me can be nice for anothe person can be really bad), I was for night firgtened to find any rat, and what did it happen?, Notting.Everything was fine. Staff? I work in a hotel and I am more. more, more, more polite and friednly, but they was making their job, I can not make any complaint, but I would do more things for the customers in my hotel, but in my hotel is diferent.If I have the oportunity to come back in London, I dont mind to come back to this hotel."
114,1120,"Sep 21 2006 	Good standard in family apartment	I booked a three room apartment at the Royal Court Apartments for a weekend with my parents, brother and boyfriend. It was very short notice (on the day!) as we cancelled our previous reservation of a hotel after reading horrid comments on this website. The apartment was spacious, the beds were clean and not too hard/soft, we had a lining area with sofa, TV set and a kitchen, which was great for cooking fry-ups in the morning and storing drinks in the fridge. The interior of the apartment was a wee bit dated, nothing flash for sure, but it was clean, the shower worked and it was great to have the privacy with three separete rooms and two bath rooms. On phoning the business, we paid 200 per night (on a website earlier they had quoted a more expensive price), which is not too bad for five people in London!A word of warning though: when we stayed, it was around 20-22 degrees in London and the rooms were already quite warm, therefore it must be very hot during the summer months!!"
115,1120,"Jun 19 2006	A horrible experience!	The sheets and towels were clean, but the rooms were dirty, the elevators were disgustingly dirty. We had to beg to get the promised additional bed. We were told that 1 double bed and 2 twin beds were enough for 6 people! The furniture was ripped and torn. It was 78 degrees outside and we had to call and ask them to turn the heat off in our rooms! The floor creaked loudly when you walked across the room. The carpet was full of stains and filthy! We were preparing to leave by about 11:15 a.m. (check out time is 11) and a knock came on the door at exactly 11 telling us it was time to leave. I have never, ever stayed in such a terrible place for the money. If it was extremely cheap I might have been willing to live with it, but there was no excuse for this. On the same trip we stayed in apartments in Rome and Paris that were wonderful with great locations and great accomodations for much less money. We couldn't wait to leave."
116,1120,May 1 2006	great spot	we just stayed here for 3 days as our friend was running the marathon.we had originally bookes 2 studios but on arrival we recieved a 2 bedroom apartment which turned out better for our group.the decor is quite dated but the rooms where spotless and cleaned every morning and towels replaced.the kitchen facilities were ample the fridge came in handy for keepin the beer cold! the only minor problem we incurred was the lack of air conditioning(very stuffy at night) and the squeaky floorboards other than that the location was great and the staff friendly
117,1120,"Apr 7 2006	Lovely place to stay in Isle Of Wight	Myself and partner stayed for 3 days in February 2005. We took the car ferry from Southampton to Cowes, Sandown was very easy to find and so were the appartments. To be honest it didnt look like much from the outside but once we get in and had a tour by the owner, we were gobsmacked! The appartment was so lovely, everything we could possibly want we had! The bedroom had a lovely 4 poster bed, the bathroom had a huge jacuzzi bath! Kitchen and living room were great and we even had a front garden bit! We only paid 150 for this break including ferry Being a first time visiter to the Island I was very impressed(even in the winter)!!! The island is gorgeous, and Sandown was very peaceful and interesting village! I cant wait to go back to the Island in the Summer and thoroughly recommend this accommodation for future visitors"
118,1120,"Mar 15 2006	We are living here	My daughter and I have been living in this hotel apartment for 3 months, for the price you are paying to be in this location it is great! We have seen 3 rooms and some are better than others, but they have all been clean and we have fresh towels everyday.As for the mice, if you are careful with your food and don't make it available to them, they will not come to your room, it is as simple as that, these are old victorian mansions and have character.The decor isn't 2006 but for the price it does the job, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the lobby and lounge are undergoing refurbishment right now and are looking very smart. As for the lift, yes it does bang when it starts but it has got us to our room everyday for 3 months, it also always makes us laugh, so how bad is that. You can reach all of London easily from here - a lot of it by foot. We will miss the place when we move."
119,1120,"Mar 10 2006	Excellent Location Decent Quality Worth the (Budget Traveler) Price	I stayed in this hotel from March 5th, 2006 - March 9th, 2006. I stayed in a 'single' room. As stated before this is in an excellent location, rather close to Paddington station, which makes up for it's short comings especially for a budget traveler. The room was clean and cleaned daily. The wallpaper was pealing in one location. The TV didn't get many channels, but that wasn't why I was in London. The kitchen kind of smelled, and wasn't something that they cleaned as part of housekeeping. The bathroom was more than I expected from a budget hotel in Europe. They had a 'breakfast' that wasn't included in the rate that I had, I paid for it one day at almost 4 pounds and got only toast and cereal. I would stay here again if I ever visit London again."
120,1120,"Mar 2 2006	Yikes!!!	I stayed at this hotel in May 2005 during a ladies trip to London with my mom, grandmother and aunts. Being my first trip to London I didn't have high expectations as I had travelled around Europe before and knew to expect rooms different than those at home in Canada. But I never could have prepared myself for this hotel. We were in a three bedroom suite with a kitchen. Although the location was awesome, nothing else about this hotel was good. The elevator was broken, the antenna on our TV was held together with a Band-Aid (!!), the carpets were gross - stained with I don't know what - and the appliances in the kitchen were older than me (25!!). I have never been so grossed out and disappointed in my life. Needless to say, we checked out of the hotel only hours after our arrival. Every hotel we went to looking for a room felt sorry for us being stuck at this dive and all wanted to help us out. There are an unbelievable amount of hotels around the Royal Court so when you visit London stay away from this hotel!!!"
121,1120,"Jan 25 2006	We'd come back!	It was just fine.my husband and I spend 4 nights (jan. 12 to Jan. 16 2006) in this quiet hotel. the hotel is under construction and we didnt get the studio which we had booked but that didnt really bother us. we came home late at night and left around 10h in the morning so we didnt spend much time within the rooms.we had 2 single beds and another &quot;living room&quot; which had a couch, tv and a table with 2 chairs. they also put some sugar and coffee on the table and the rooms were very clean. the ensuite bathroom was freezing cold and tiny. it was not one of the most modern bathrooms, some tiles were broken, tiny sink and the pressure of the shower was not the best. but it was clean, new towels every day. the rooms are furnished in an old style but thats typical british. but overall, it was worth the money and it offers easy access to london. even the sightseeing busses (big bus company and the origional sightseeing tour company) have a bus stop at the end of the road. the staff was very friendly. on our departure day we could leave our luggage there for no extra cost. and if the whole hotel looks like the new lounge room after their renovation it will look very very good. we would come back."
122,1120,"Dec 10 2005	Please... never stay there!	I stayed in these apartments from 25th to 28th of March 2005. We were 4 people and we got two rooms... two different rooms! One of them was soooo small that 2 people could hardly sleep there (plus, it only had a small bed):it was what they call a studio, placed underground where nobody can hear you if something bad is happeneing to you. The other one, was a palace! It was big enought because it was an appartment: a room, a bathroom and a big living-room with a kitchenette and tv and some other useful things. so, you are lucky if you have one of those appartments...On the other hand, it was clean though and thanks God we did not see the mouse! The staff was friendly (most of them). But be careful with the woman in the breakfast (in the building in front of the hotel): she was rude with us (and with the rest of the people) and we had to complain in the reception (the next day, she was kind and friendly with us). The only good thing is the location: it's just in front of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park so you can go walking until Oxfort Street (it only takes 15 minutes).Despite we had problems with changing rooms and they solved it, I won't stay here because we had problems since the first moment. It was clean, but not good when it comes to quality and price. You can get something better around."
123,1120,Oct 26 2005	Beware!	The interior was a bit shabby but the room itself was clean enough so I thought its not that bad. BUT I would never recommend my friends to stay here since my purse got stolenthere was only one door lock so I thought it was rather insecure
124,1120,"Oct 18 2005	Mouse crawling up baby crib!	We spent three nights at the Royal Court Apartments between October 15th and October 18th. The first couple of nights we had a nice size studio with kitchen on the third floor. Nice bathroom and cute view. It wasn't really clean though when we came in. There was cat or dog hair all over the kitchen floor and table, hair in the bathroom and the bedroom carpeting was heavily stained. But we thought this was ok. The last night, the staff which we found very friendly and helpful, showed us a different room across the street which we turned down because it was very small and unattractive, a dive basically. Next they gave us a studio on the ground floor, not nearly as nice as the one on the third floor and we asked to change rooms after the very loud people next door kept our baby awake for a while. Our next room was ok too, nothing to write home about. We were chatting quietly while our baby was sleeping in his crib when we heard a scratchy noise. My husband got up and saw an ugly brown mouse trying to climb up our baby's crib. That was more than we could take so he rushed to the reception area and they immediately moved us to a nicer studio on the third floor. So, we have seen five of their rooms over the course of the week-end. Some are ok, some are really not but it's a great location, within walking distance from Hyde Park and other great sights...."
125,1120,"Oct 7 2005	The Price is Right	My mother and I just stayed at the Royal Court from Sept 27 - Oct 4, 2005 and had a wonderful time. The price was right for the location. It is less then a 5 minute walk to and from Paddington Station and the bus service , and alot of great eating establishment in the area to choose from or if you get a studio with a kitchen as we did you could pick up food from the store(s) to fix. We had a small studio apartment up on the second floor. The mouse I saw was running under the food shelf at the food store in Paddington Station. I speak only English and I had no problem speaking and understanding any of the staff here. I have travel around the world and have learned that if you slow down and stop and listen you will understand the staff and they will understand you . Yes, they are working on the hotel and the carpets in the hallway could use a cleaning or changing. Our studio was clean from the bed sheets to the bathroom and the room was cleaned daily. If you have a room with the kitchen as we did, it is your responsibliltiy to wash your dishes or read the notice on the cabinet door that you will be changed for a fee for the staff to clean the dishes. I would stay here again. The friendly staff makes it worth the stay along with the location!"
126,1120,"Oct 6 2005 	Egads what a dump!	The best things I can say about this place was that the fridge in the room worked and the location was stellar- around the corners from Lancaster Gate and Paddington tube stops. I had a twin room which was tiny and an even tinier bathroom- the sink was so tiny I had to wash one hand at a time! There is no AC and no satellite TV (just three or four channels you can get with rabbit ears). The bed was OK, but it squeaked even up you merely twitched. The walls had paper on them from two eras- the top half from the 30's and the lower half from the 70's and was peeling away. The street below is very noisy at all hours and the corridors are dank and narrow. The lift was frightening- I was never sure if I would get out alive. Did not have the flea and mice experience some others had, thankfully. If I stay in this part of London again, I'll pick a different hotel as there are many others around the block."
127,1120,"Oct 4 2005	Great find	I was a little leery about this place as I had read many non flattering reviews...was I ever pleasantly surprised. Found it on Expedia and it was only 50 GBP/ nite for a twin studio with a kitchenette. The room was quite big with a big bathroom (not something common in London). The decor was dated but the room was very clean, and the beds comfy. The locale was great (only 1/2 block form Hyde park/Kensington gardens) and close to bus and tube stops. The front desk staff was helpful and available to answer any questions. I would recommend this to my friends and look forward to staying there again.MKCanada"
128,1120,"Sep 27 2005	I found a mouse in my room	I stayed at Royal Court apartments for a week last October. Everything was clean and my double studio apartment was fine and clean, the staff seemed correct and all was ok, but one day I found a mouse on my room while I was trying to relax watching the TV, I don't know if it's ussual in England to find a mouse but I'm Spanish, and for me finding a mouse is really, really disgusting. So I went to the reception in the middle of the night with my pijama to tell them about the mouse situation, and they wasn`t very polite, they kept me waiting for a long time in the reception unlit the manager came, I told him about the situation, and he said very rude &quot;Come on, don't worry! it's only a mouse not a tiger!!&quot; and I told him &quot;yeah, but it's not something that you expect to find in a room that you are paying for!!!&quot; So, they gave me another room for the night in the first floor that they were &quot;redecorating&quot; and the new room was really dump and much smaller and worse than mine. They were really rude with me and the didn't even mention about a discount or not paying the correspondent prize of that night. The next morning they told me that they got rid of it, but I wansn't very sure because everything was in the same place that I left it. Thank god I din't have time to comfirt if the mouse wasn't really there because I got my suitcases and left the apartment the next morning."
129,1120,"Sep 16 2005	Dont even consider booking it	I ve read a few reviews on the site just before i chose this hotel and all that because someone had a posting &quot;Lies, Internet Lies&quot; i considered booking this hotel just for the price location of it.Lies internet Lies not always trueLocation-wise: excellent, Paddington is 2min away from the hotel which makes Heathrow airport just a 20min ride away (Heathrow xpress). you also have bayswater in front of your legs, hyde park is 30secs walk and Lancaster Gate tube is just there by the corner make it a 1min walk tops.Cleaniness-wise: disgusting!!! disgusting!!! the room was very dirty. Bitten by fleas daily, towels are changed once during stay but the maids do bother cleaning the dishes in your small kitchenette. However we discovered that our blankets had sperm dried out on them (that means noone actually bothered changing/washing them after the previous occupant)Luxury-wise: hotel (building) is around 200yr old. Basically its 8 victorian houses stuck together in a way that reminds a maze. At least there are loads of fire escapes so you can be saved when the ceiling falls on yous head. Rooms are in a style that reminds 30's-40's industrial England maybe with a touch of nice Victorian wallpaper which is outdated. Someone please rennovate this hotel NOW!!!Staff-wise: brilliant all guys are very helpful except the maids that dont speak english at all and the indian/pakistani receptionists that are very hard to understand. However a somalian and spanish girl working at nights are brilliant and extremely helpful. These two were honest to tell us &quot;how in hell did you take the decision to stay here?&quot;I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and i wont even pass the same street ever again.We had a reservation for 7nights, we made it for four nights till we asked to be moved to another hotel of rcahotels.co.uk which is cheaper, cleaner and is a true 3*** hotel around the corner from the Royal Court Appartments.I would consider this hotel excellent for backpackers but not for bussinessmen or holiday makers because it will ruin your stay in London unless you want to stay centrally."
130,1120,"Sep 14 2005	Avoid 'Royal' Court	Found this one on Last Minute Hotels, and the price seemed too good to be true, given the list of amenities, which included a health club, laundry facilities, etc. None of the amenities were there. The room was cramped, not very clean, and very noisy (work crews were hammering by 8 AM each day). The staff was baffled, and often baffling.We shared our room with a mouse, who did his work at night.Only the reasonably convernient location, cheap price, and the fact that the room motivated us to maximize our time seeing London kept us sane."
131,1120,"Aug 7 2005	Lies the internet lies	My dad booked this hotel online; the hotel looked nice and so did the pictures, but when we got to the hotel, the lobby was small and dirty and the check-in staff could not speak english properly. They spoke as if they were from france. After we checked in we went to the elevators wich sound like they would break down every time they moved. The corridors were tiny and the carpet was dirty. When we got into our room, there was a smell in it, the floor was not leveled and the room was dirty and dusty. The bathroom was dirty and the fixtures were falling off the wall. The internet said that they had satellite TV, but it was just rabbit ears and could only get three channels. The beds were uncomfortable and smelled. I had to sleep on a fold up bed which every time you moved, the bed closed up. The net also said that it had AC but it didn't. The room was very hot and stuffy in the night and there was a street light right outside our room window. The street was very noisy at all times of night. The next day we moved to another hotel immediately ( named the Copthrorn Thara which was good ).If you can, try to avoid it."
132,1120,"Jul 21 2005	Mouse in the house at RCA Paddington	We stayed for 2 nights in the RCA Paddington Hotel our first 2 nights in London in September 2004. We had booked through research on-line, including pictures. The neighborhood was similar, but I am not so sure the building was. The location was great, close to Paddington, Kensington Gardens, lots of great restaurants in a good neighborhood. I don't know if the hotel owned numerous locations, was remodeling or what, but the address we had gotten referred us across the street. The common areas and rooms were a bit dingy and run down. Our room had 2 twin beds instead of the one we had assumed we would get. The front desk staff was a bit unapproachable, so we didn't ask for anything else. I awoke both nights to the sound of a mouse, the first night on the nightstand between the beds, and the next night under the head of my bed! Needless to say I didn't sleep very well after that. I loved the convenience of the location and the neighborhood, but was not sad to leave our room for other accommodations the next few nights."
133,1120,"Jun 2 2005	Royal Court Apartments is home!	It's graet having kitchen facilities in your hotel room. A microwave lets you sample many curry dishes available in refrigerated sections of markets and a fridge is invaluable. I stayed at RCA for 9 nights in early May 2005. This, my second visit there. There was a mouse in my ground floor room and I was moved by staff to an upgraded, 2 room suite on a higher floor. I'm convinced the mouse was result of all the construction going on in the large lounge. I walked in without reservation and paid about $85. a night. Outstanding for central London! RCA is half a block from Hyde Park/Kensington gardens and the Lancaster gate tube station. half block from food stores, liqour store and a 5 minute walk from the Heathrow Express at Paddington station. I just love the staff at RCA. Good humored, very helpful and professional. I will always stay at RCA."
134,1120,"Mar 8 2005	Good Deal In London on Budget	My husband and I travel to London frequently on business and pleasure. With the current US exchange rates, one is hard-pressed to find hotels in London that are &quot;budget&quot; in US dollar prices. This property is a step up from a better quality hostel, and is certainly worth it, considering you are two blocks from Lancaster Gate Tube Station, Hyde Park, and a short walk to Paddington Station (the London-Heathrow express terminates at Paddington). The hotel is a one or two star American rating, but the staff was helpful, and made efforts to have the room clean (even dishes done!) each day. There were rennovations going on when we were there in Sept 04, and the main hallways and some of the drapery/furnishings were a bit run-down. Plentiful hot water in an older bathroom, and towels were clean and in abundance. No breakfast, but you have a decent studio kitchenette (ask for one of the larger studios on the first floor). If you are only used to the larger US chain hotels, you will probably not be comfortable at this site. If you are there to impress clients or friends with opulent surroundings, this is not the place to stay. If you'd rather spend your US dollars on other London attractions, or are on a real budget then consider this a good choice. -D.C., Philadelphia PA"
135,1120,"Mar 1 2005	Cheap digs at the RCA	It may be good value, but the room (studio) was extremely tiny and cramped. My second day I was overcome with noxious sewer gas in the room, and they gave me a different and larger room with no problems. The location is terrific, the kitchen outfitted well; but the apartments were not really clean- dingy, and pretty tattered with the usual problems with water pressure. I also think that I may have had some money taken- my fault as I didn't use the safe. I think there are better &quot;deals&quot; out there."
136,1120,"Dec 1 2004	Don't go near it	There are few bargains on the London hotel scene, and this proves it. I booked in for just one night to be near Paddington Station, but I regret not paying more for a place where I could have even a modicum of comfort. A tiny room with a cooker and sink in the corner, a lumpy single bed which gave me the creeps wondering if it was clean, tatty decor, and the overpowering stench of a cheap air freshener. And to top it all - I hope you're not eating - the toilet bowl hadn't been properly cleaned after the last guest and I had to scrub it with the brush. Fortunately I spent the evening out and arrived back after a few drinks so I could bear to lie on the bed. Even so, I woke at 6am, showered, attempted to shave with the dribble of water coming from the taps, and got out. Awful, awful, awful. Don't go near it."
137,1120,"Nov 7 2004	no fleas cant believe some of these reviews!	we stayed here from the 30th oct to the 5th of nov and we cannot believe some of the reviews about this hotel on here. We found it very cosy, great for the price and the location is fantastic. They even did our dishes for us while we were out and cleaned up the rooms even though we were very late leaving one day. The bed was comfortable, the microwave, 2 rings and fridge were fantastic, saving us money on having to eat out all the time. Its right around the corner from lancaster gate tube and a short walk from paddington so your only minutes from all the london sights. The truly beautiful hyde park is also literally just around the corner and we spent many lunchtimes walking around and enjoying one of the nicest inner city parks ive ever seen.We booked our room and then found the reviews on here and to be honest we were a little worried, but all fears soon dissapeared upon arrival. The staff were all genuinely helpful, although they have a strange system of dropping your room key off in the lobby before going out and then collecting it when you arrive back after they see your room id card, although its one less thing to have to worry about losing in london.the room was on a relatively quiet london street, although you did get some traffic, but we had 5 nights good sleep here and cant recommend this hotel enough if your looking for a cosy hotel with a a great price and location. We will be coming back :)"
138,1120,"Oct 21 2004	rather seedy	We stayed at the Royal Court Apartments from 16th-19th October 2004. Although the apartment was threadbare and needed some maintenance and modernisation, it represented good value for it's central London location. The apartment was cleaned everyday and clean towels supplied. It was pretty quiet and we had a good nights sleep in the comfortable bed. I wouldn't recommend this if you want luxury, but if you want a central location at low prices this is o.k."
139,1120,"Oct 20 2004	We got flea bites! Avoid this place!	Room was dirty when we checked in and there was leftover food that left rotten in the refrigerator. Toilet tissue was everywhere on the floor.Worst of all, we got flea bites. What more can I say to convince you not to stay in this hotel.I have been to London several time and know the general hotel standard. But with 70 per night without breakfast, I could have get a better room elsewhere."
140,1120,"Aug 18 2004	good value	We have just come back from staying at the Royal Court Apartments. After reading the reviews I was a little worried. However, it was excellent value for money some of the furniture was worn some looked very new. It was VERY clean plenty of towels soap etc. The staff helpful and polite. The location is excellent very close to Lancaster Gate Tube. Close to Hyde Park I would most certainly stay there again."
141,1120,"Jul 6 2004	Disappointed	Got the apartment of the internet...how I wish I'd seen the reviews first! It is nothing like the pictures displayed on various web sites. The location is great, the staff are friendly and try their best to help but... the accommodation is very sub standard. On arriving in our first room, I was horrified! The place was dirty, dank and extremely depressing. The bathroom was like a broom cupboard decorated with mould. After walking round London for a few hours we decided we could not stay in the room, even if it meant losing our money and finding an alternative. After speaking with a very friendly member of the reception staff, we were given keys for an alternative room. Whilst not brilliant, this was a hundred times better. It was clean and comfortable, although still very dated. It is not worth the gamble and could certainly ruin your stay in London. For a few pounds more, you can find much better accommodation out there. I would avoid this like the plague.."
142,1120,Jun 16 2004	Spacious and clean - consider the price!	We have been there with our 13 month old baby and did not get sick at all like one of the previous reviewers. The room was pretty spacious and the kitchen properly equiped. They cleaned the room daily and upon request even twice (a lot of dust come through the open window. And best of all: The room was very quite (window to the backside). We met there with my sister who is living in London and she was surprised how silent it can be in that city.To make a long story short: For that price it is really recommendable. We would definitely go there again saving the money others pay for an apartment for shopping on Oxfort street.
143,1120,"Jun 13 2004	Satisfactory stay	Wow. It sounds like people have had some awful experiences here. My stay was perfectly fine!First off, I have to say that when I booked this location, it was listed as a 3 star facility. It's not, it's more a 2 star place. Some people complained about the rooms being freezing, ours was cooking! We kept the windows open most of the time there to keep the temperature manageable. The room was on the threadbare side, and I had some trouble with the shower (had a tough time stabilizing the shower head, and there was no hot water if you wanted to shower at odd hours of the night). Our in-room phone was out of comission. And once, when I went out very early in the morning, I had to wait outside for about 5 minutes before I was buzzed back in b/c the front desk attendant was away. But the room was cleaned every day, and I didn't find the bathroom cramped (full bath + shower). I thought the room was spacious, with a couch and a couple of chairs. All the promised kitchen equipment was there. The staff was helpful. I had a clean room in a very good location at a good price. I would definitely have stayed there again...after reading all the below reviews, I probably would still stay there again."
144,1120,"Mar 24 2004	Reviews prepared me....not that bad	After reading the reviews here, I was very scared. But the place was not bad at all. The rooms were tiny, the matress left me with an achy back the next morning. But the room was clean, the staff was friendly, the shower was great and there was a decent microwave &amp; fridge in our room. Our experience was not at all unpleasant."
