167,662,Mar 12 2008 	More like a ships cabin	Just returned from 2 nights at Corus Hyde Park. My daughter had a single room that was no larger than a cross channel ferry cabin. It was also next to the lift which kept my daughter awake and the sound of drunks leaving the lift in the early hours was not acceptable. We had a double room with a bathroom that was smaller than our toilet at home. This hotel could not be compared to other 4 star London hotels we have stayed in.
168,662,Mar 11 2008	Small rooms good staff	We have just returned from 2 nights at The Corus Hyde . The hotel is right next to Hyde Park and 10 minutes from Paddington station. The Hotel itself was clean but the room a standard was too small for a 4 stars hotel in centrale london. However the service we received was very good (Daniel the porter in particular and the check in staff). We enjoyed our time at The Corus Hyde but its not really worth a second visit.Dave and Karen
169,662,"Mar 10 2008 	Great Location	Excellent location, but only for a short stay.The room was the smallest room i have ever stayed in!Breakfast was good, nothing that special though! Service and decor were excellent and the views over Hyde Park amazing!Beautifuly designed hotel in a classy area!Stroll through Hyde Park to end up either to Buckingham Palace or West End and the Lancaster Gate tube is only seconds away.I didn't eat at the hotel in the evenings, but I had a fantasticaly tasty vegetable soup there!"
170,662,"Mar 8 2008 	All true	Just returned from this hotel having booked it after reading reviews on tripadviser. Could not agree more with the praise it received. When we arrived we were given an immediate room upgrade free of charge.The room was small but planned to work well with two occupants.Did intend to eat out but gave the Olio Brasserie a try and booked for the following evening as well as the food was excellent.Our only criticism was that the continental breakfast was rather limited more choice of meat and some fresh fruit would have been nice.The position was excellent too with being so close to Lancaster Gate Tube,all the major attractions were within easy reach.A journey to the Maritime museum at Greenwich was only 45 minutes using the Central line and DLR and cost 2 using an Oyster Card. These cards are a must for anyone intending to use the Underground to get around saves all the hastle of buying tickets etc."
171,662,"Mar 4 2008 	Very nice hotel	We booked this hotel as part of a British Airways package. It has a gorgeous lobby, the staff are very friendly and professional. The rooms are quite small by American standards, but I understand this is a typical room in Europe. Nevertheless, it is clean, tidy and attractive; I didn't come to London to hang out in the room anyway. Hotel is located in a beautiful neighborhood full of other small hotels catering to foreign tourists of all nationalities. Close to a variety of restaurants and takeaway shops if you're too tired after a hard day of sightseeing. Within walking distance of Paddington Station (approx 5 mins) and a block from the Lancaster Gate tube.Wireless access in room for a fee, in-room hair dryer, iron and laptop size safe."
172,662,"Mar 4 2008	Great location and hotel	We have just returned from a one night stay at the Corus hotel.The hotel was superb and ideally situated opposite Hyde Park. Lancaster Gate tube station was easy access about 5 minutes walk from hotel.Staff were very friendly and rooms were contemporary and clean.Breakfast was excellent, would definitely book this hotel again."
173,662,Feb 27 2008 	great place for short stays	We loved this hotel. Rooms are small but clean and bright. Breakfast was fine. You could eat in the sunroom overlooking Hyde Park.. Lancaster Gate underground 1/2 block away to your left. Paddington Station about a 5 min. walk. The on and off bus tours one exit down at Marble Arch. The hotel staff was very helpful and funny and friendly. We ate next door at Swan once. A small store next door to the hotel you can buy water and etc. We ate at Khan's a wonderful Indian Rest. that we took a 4 pound cab ride from the hotel. The area around the hotel was safe.
174,662,"Feb 25 2008 	Small but convenient	My wife, daughter and I stayed here for two nights (weekend) and found the location to be ideal, buses and tube nearby and park opposite for pleasant stroll. The reception, and dining area is ideal and the service and staff very helpful and pleasant and breakfast (english) was plentiful and well presented.The accommodation for two persons is poor. My daughter had the same, a double room, and found for one person it was quite adequate.The rooms are small, no access to both sides of the bed and only one dining type chair between two persons and the lack of double glazing made the traffic noise seem louder, no drawer space so smaller items need to be kept in your suitcase The bathroom is also quite small with height restriction in the shower and hardly any space to put out your toiletries etc. The whole room gave the impression of &quot;student&quot; accommodation .If i need more than two days then this would not be the place i would chose"
175,662,"Feb 22 2008 	Good Hotel	I stayed for one night at the Corus Hyde Park with my two daughters, 15 and 11 having gone to London to do shopping/theatre. As I was travelling on my own with them for the first time (ie minus husband), I spent ages searching the internet beforehand for a suitable hotel and I was careful to also read any available reviews. This hotel was well situated to walk into Oxford Street for shopping, not too far from Paddington for the Heathrow Express and in a quiet area right next to Hyde Park. It was lovely to have a doorman open the door of our taxi and show us into the hotel. The hotel's reception is very grand and you felt like it was going to be a good hotel. Everybody polite and helpful. I was a bit disappointed about the size of the room but it was good quality and had everything we could possibly want for an overnight stay. We had an executive double room with a fold out bed for my youngest daughter who slept like a log. Personally, I found the bed a little soft for my liking but that's just me.The breakfast was good and it was lovely to walk through Hyde Park down to Oxford Street. Overall a good experience and I would use it again."
176,662,"Feb 19 2008 	Small but perfectly formed	We stayed here on Saturday and had a very pleasant night. Our double room was small but had everything we needed including hairdryer, trouser press and iron, which are often not found in other London hotels. The staff were friendly and helpful, and check in and check out went very smoothly. The location is perfect for a night out in London, it is easy to get to by public transport, we had no trouble getting a cab in front of the hotel and on returning in the early hours of the morning the area was quiet and safe. A continental breakfast (included in our booking) was served in our room at no extra cost. It is worth noting if you are staying on the weekend and driving to the hotel, although the hotel itself has no parking there are several roads nearby with no parking restrictions on Saturday and Sunday and we were able to park our car free of charge."
177,662,"Feb 6 2008 	A Fine Hotel	The hotel is conveniently located very near the underground and several bus routes as well as being across the street from Hyde Park for wonderful walks. My standard single room and bathroom were small but beautifully designed to maximize space and efficiency . There was a flat screen TV on the wall across from the bed and there were attractive sliding shutters on the window. The sound proofing was good as I was not disturbed with noise from neighboring rooms. The continental breakfast was entirely adequate with a selection of fruit juices, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, croissants, hard rolls, sliced ham, grapefruit and orange slices and packaged cheeses and jams. A selection of local newspapers were piled in the lobby and could be taken for free. There are two computers in the lobby and one in the business center and can be used at a cost of 1 pound per 10 minutes. There are internet cafes nearby on Craven Street which are considerably less expensive - 1 pound for one hour's use. I must add that there were several steps leading down to my room which might be a hindrance for anyone with mobility problems but i saw other rooms without steps. Obviously I was very pleased with my six days at the Corus and plan to stay there again."
178,662,"Jan 30 2008 	Very pleased!	Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Corus hotel Hyde Park in London for 4 nights. The location is perfect; right next to Hyde Park, 2 minutes to the Underground (Lancaster Gate) and within walking distance from Oxford Street.The room was small, but very clean and nicely decorated. We didn't spend much time there anyway, since we were exploring London for the first time.The continental breakfast was included in the price and was good, although it was the same everyday. The coffee was surprisingly good! Our last morning we upgrated to an english breakfast just to try it out and it was good as well.The staff was friendly and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who is going to London!"
179,662,"Jan 27 2008 	Great Location - Tiny Rooms - Friendly Staff	I stayed at this Hotel in the witer and was happy that the windows would open as it got quite warm at times...I am hot blooded so it just could be me!. The hotel feels like it is in a neighborhood rather than a tourist area. It is right in next to Hyde Park, Bus Lines, and a Tube station is a short walk. The furniture and bedding appear'd to be new and the staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay here again with no hesitation. Good Value."
180,662,"Jan 14 2008	Functional but small room	The hotel was ideally situated only 4 tube stops (on the Central line) from the heart of London. The reasonably priced room we stayed in was SMALL (only 7' x 20' ) but it did have everything you needed except for a comfy bed and air-conditioning (just a noisy fan. AC being rolled out to all rooms currently and the window did open). TV, Wifi, private WC/shower, hair-dryer, iron+board, loads of light especially some freaky green light in the bathroom.The hotel staff were all freindly and helpfull especially when we got locked out of our room on the 2nd day, when the card wouldn't open the door.If what your looking for is a place to lay your head after doing the whole tourist thing, then this would suit but not for more than a couple of days.AB, Bedfordshire."
181,662,"Jan 14 2008 	Good overnight choice but not for longer stay	Stayed here because I had a pre-Christmas dinner in London. The room was 'compact' but somehow surprisingly spacious, thanks to clever design (like the curved worksurface somebody else has written about). So, okay for one or two nights but probably would get claustrophic for any longer.Nice lobby area and comfortable bar. Early serving for breakfast. Good rates if you book Late Room through well know internet site. Would probably use again"
182,662,"Jan 7 2008	Good Location hotel needs improvement!	Just spent 2 nights at the corus hyde park, the hotel being in a good area. Car parking is a slight issue as it is abit of walk from the hotel, we made the mistake of not dropping the bags off rather than lugging them around. Once at the hotel 3 members of concierge watched us with our bags.. helpful! Check-in staff were pleasant. We had upgraded to an Executive room and wish we hadn'd botthered and actually feel robbed! The room was sooo small and bed took up the whole room, the carpets were filthy dirty, bed linen was all ripped, stains on the bottom of the bed where the mattress sits, I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. The hotel, needs a complete overhaul, and also needs to be more honest with the standard of accommodation on there website, when I booked I wondered why there only had a small picture of a bedroom this is obvious now because they are not proud of there rooms! If you get a really really good rate, then this hotel is good dont expect anything special as you wont get it. Try to call ahead and see if you can get a Laura Ashley room, as these are the newest refurbed rooms. It is worth paying extra to have a full english rather then the continential, however there are many a cafe and bistro type places around to get Breakfast also. Nearest car park: Queensway 22 per night Tube: QueenswayBoth of which are about 20-25 mins walk."
183,662,"Jan 6 2008 	tiny rooms	Visiting London with my parents for a graduation ceremony. Hotel rated as 4 * and clearly had good location so we were looking forward to our visit. Positives: When we arrived we were initailly impressed with the foyer and bar area. We had 2 rooms and were given them next door to each other. Breakfast was delicious a hot buffet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Negatives: Both rooms were very small. I managed okay in the single but expected more from the hotel, but my parents who aren't as young as they used to be had a very small double room. The bed was in the corner with one side against the wall as it would not have fit in the middle of the room. There was no storage space at all save for a couple of coat hangers and a rail, no where to sit except one desk chair and it all felt a bit claustrophobic. The bathroom was also tiny and you had to climb into a very high sided bath to have a shower. I agree with another review in that they seem to have divided 1 larger room into 2 small ones to fit as many guests in as possible. Its a shame as it is a nice hotel"
184,662,"Jan 3 2008 	Fabulous location opposite Hyde Park	After a killer 26 hour flight from Australia, we were very impressed with this hotel and in particular the location - such a stylish, upmarket part of London! The staff were quite pleasant, and the rooms, although neat and tidy, were very small. We were thrilled that an iron and ironing board were supplied, as this wasn't the case in other hotels throughout Europe. There is a fabulous pub next door which I can recommend, and the proximity to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube was a real bonus. The Continental breakfast leaves much to be desired - although we later realised that you can upgrade to an English breakfast, and take this into the restaurant downstairs which was fantastic. We stayed in this hotel in early October 07, and found the room to be very hot and needed to keep the window open. Only problem was, the window wouldn't stay open so we needed to use the tea tin to keep it wedged open! But besides that minor glitch, we were happy with this hotel, and would certainly stay again."
185,662,"Dec 18 2007 	Very good hotel with only minor flaws	Stayed here for 6 nights. Overall, a very good hotel and would likely stay there again. Excellent location - right across from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, near the Lancaster Gate tube station, not far from Paddington Station (trains) and close to a lot of good dining options. The hotel is is in very good shape, especially the lobby and lounge area. The rooms are small but clean and well-appointed. Great customer service. Has some minor areas that need improvement, but is a recommended hotel.The areas for improvement: the continental breakfast is decent, but there was no change during the entire stay - even mixing it up with a different fruit or selection or rolls or cereal would help for those staying multiple nights. The TV in our room was a very small set mounted at 90 degree angle to the bed (ever watch TV sideways?). Lastly, the lack of free wireless internet is a drawback for those who live in a connected world (isn't that most of us now?) The charge is excessive (5 GBP for 10 minutes), so if access is important there are numerous internet cafes and stores within walking distance that offer reasonable rates (99p for 1 hour)."
186,662,"Dec 3 2007	Great Room - Great Location	This is a great hotel in an excellent location, the exterior is really nice, very old building just at the entrance to Hyde Park. The Lancaster gate underground is literally a 2minute walk from the hotel. we had a really nice twin bedroom. it was on the 8th floor. Granted - the room was small but it was exceptionally clean and the decor very modern. I would definetely recommend this to my friends and family who will be visiting london. Overall Great Hotel for the price."
187,662,"Dec 3 2007 	OK but some problems	OK, but had a few issues that I wouldn't expect of a 4 star hotel.Got to the hotel and went to check into our triple room at 5.30pm. Was told the room wasn't ready even though check in time was 2pm and we could leave our bags and come back later. We had theatre tickets and wanted to get to our room and freshen up, so was not happy with this - we agreed we could go drop our bags off while housekeeping were still cleaning. The beds weren't even made.The room was clearly not a triple - it was a double room they had squashed in a small metal spring bed in - this was very uncomfortable for an adult. We were not told this at time of booking. When we got back to hotel later on after our evening out, it was very hard to try and get drinks at the bar. You couldn't pay cash and unless you had put your credit card with reception, you couldn't get drinks unless you went back to reception and gave them the credit card and then went back to the bar. What a performance for a couple of orange juices! Not impressed.Continental breakfast was included - croissants, rolls and cereal. Not a huge selection."
188,662,"Nov 30 2007 	Awful	Staff were pleasant - the only saving grace. The room, with its laughingly called designer workspace (a 'desk' which was curved!!) was so small that one side of the double bed (which only just fits the description) was aginst the wall. I can only assume that that the rooms have been made by dividing one former room into two. The bathroom.........new and clean...but equally tiny, with a brand new shower (tepid) that gets you wet, as long as you are prepared to move around. In a word - awful"
189,662,"Nov 27 2007 	A Safe Bet...	Nicely located across from Hyde Park, the hotel is clean and efficient. the rooms are typically small, but you're probably not spending much time in them anyway. Relatively good value for London.Minuses -- the conceirges must be 'on the take' for restaurant recommendations, and they didn't know how much it cost to ride the Tube! Take what they say with a grain of salt. Also, the staff at the bar is less then efficient -- you'll have to basically wait on your own table. Overall, decent mid-grade biz class hotel -- it won't knock your socks off but you won't be disappointed either."
190,662,"Nov 21 2007 	Functional...	Upon arrival we were informed by the efficient and polite reception staff that we had been &quot;upgraded&quot; to a &quot;Viceroy&quot; room. We were very pleased having had a less than smooth journey to the hotel. Unfortunately, our 7th floor upgrade (room 704) turned out to be the tiniest hotel room we have ever had. The double bed was almost too big (I did hit my head on the corner bedside table during my sleep which was a painful awakening at 4am). The room was clean and functional. The bathroom was minute and the bath panel was warped and worn (clearly water had seeped into the MDF and it had swelled - not a good look) Info about the hotel etc provided was minimal and the room &quot;reading material&quot; was a copy of the latest Laura Ashley mail order catalogue which seemed to be an unusual choice. Tea and coffee provision could be improved.The hotel overall is ok. The public areas were uninspiring production line interior design. The bar was ok (although it felt a bit yobby at midnight!), breakfast was fair, concierge was good.The best bit about the hotel for our purpose was the location as it is an easy walk to Hyde Park/Kensington, Paddington and the West End.I would not stay here again as I know that there is better on offer in London of a comparable class."
191,662,"Oct 27 2007 	Excellent!!	After reading some of the reviews, I was nervous about this hotel. However, I should'nt have been. It was excellent. The hotel is set in a fab location, just a few minutes work from Lancaster Gate tube and from the gates of Hyde Park. The reception is lovely as were the staff. Our room, a twin, was on the fourth floor. It was lovely. The room was exceptionally clean and was well decorated. The bathroom had a great shower and the towels were huge. The room was a good size. The only negative thing to comment on was the lack of drawers - the aren't any!!! I would definitely go back to this hotel."
192,662,"Oct 23 2007 	Can London Hotel rooms get any smaller?	Used this hotel on a couple of warm late September evenings. Car parking is bad with the nearest car park being a good 1/2 mile a way at Queensway. After the check in I discovered that the room I had been given was one of the smallest I had ever stayed in! Very well furnished and equipped, but the heat was incredible. They have safety catches on the window which only allowed you to open it 2 inches, so the fan stayed on all night. I complained to the receptionist on checkout who informed me that all the rooms were having aircon fitted in the future.The second visit a week or so later I asked about upgrading to an airconned executive room which was advertised at 40 extra! This was waived for me, but the exec rooms I think are almost smaller than the standard rooms, although, again I have to say well fitted apart from the fact that the standard room had a built in trouser press and iron which the exec room didn't - try figuiring that out.Breakfast was fair, but service poor and the breakfast room reminds one of a canteen! All in all a typical London hotel which if you have to use it is OK"
193,662,"Sep 30 2007 	Need to try harder given the choice in London	I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park for a couple of nights while on a business trip this September. I stayed in one of the &quot;Executive&quot; rooms which was on the 10th floor, having the luxury of Air Conditioning!!Upon arrival, the check-in desk were reasonably efficient with two people serving customers. However, there were two people behind the desk doing other jobs, and I felt that during a busy period they could have helped to get the queue down a bit.Once checked in, I was greeted by a modern room which was of a reasonable size. The decor was typical of a newer style hotel, but nothing exceptional. The room had both a shower and bath, a small desk and a TV with a small selection of channels. As an executive room I would have expected to see a Minibar and something better than nescafe to make coffee with. Free wifi would have also been a nice extra to have.Checkout was again slow, and the staff were not as polite or engaging with customers compared with other hotels I have experienced. I would rate the customer service in this hotel as below average overall.For the price of the &quot;Executive&quot; room I was very disappointed with the overall package, I have seen so much better in other hotels at equal or lesser price. Given that I stayed in a room that is supposed to be better than the majority of rooms in the hotel, I would not rate this above a Travelodge, and avoid in the future as there are many better hotels around for the money."
194,662,"Sep 22 2007 	Give it a miss	Went to London for a business trip, scoured the hotels on website and this one seemed okay and near the place I was going.Easily accessible from the tube station and good location overlooking Hyde Park, overall first impression was hey, Ive picked a good one here. Bright and spacious inside and very clean and welcoming. Imagine our delight being told we had been automatically upgraded, what a result! Expecting a nice room to go with the nice hotel, we were directed downstairs to the ground floor level, our room was overlooking a side street and passers by going past our window, not nice!To add insult to injury the room was obviously intended for little people, my husband and I, being strapping six footers were not far from headbutting the overhead air con, it was a very small room with little space to manoevre in. the bathroom was of course tiny, and very awkward to shower in. If this was an upgrade I would hate to see the one below it!The bar however was nice, run by east europeans, no surprizes there! The resturant was excellent and the full english absolutely magnificent."
195,662,"Sep 18 2007 	We went back	We have used this hotel before and went back, so this is the first good point. The rooms are small and we certainly would not advise staying there for more than a couple of nights. There is no draw space at-all and little hanging space, so you do end up living out of your suitcase. We did not find this any problem for the single night we were there.The room is clean and the tiny bathroom is clean also. The staff are friendly, and while the breakfast was not like home cooking it was plentyfull and totally self service except for the coffee. The meals in the bar area are really best avoided and the pub next door has a good menu and is reccomended.The position of the hotel is a big selling point - an easy walk to the Tube and right on the park that we walked across to get to Buckingham Pallace, (due to a Tube strike)As long as you don't need masses of room and won't spend a lot of time in your room this is an ideal hotel in London for short stays"
196,662,"Sep 8 2007 	No air con!!	this hotel was ok - not worth the money it was sooooo HOT no air con at all, unbearable at night !! rooms were nothing like the pics i saw online...old fashioned decor but clean."
197,662,"Aug 28 2007 	Good Location but no air con	Location for the hotel is excellent a few minutes walk from lancaster Gate station. The rooms were very small but were modern and clean, the real problem was the lack of air conditioning. We were there in July and whilst it was not the warmest summer on record(!!!!) it was quite muggy which made the one fan in the room not much use at combating the heat.I think you can pay to upgrade rooms to executive level which does have air con but the hotel was fully booked whilst we were there.Lobby and bar of the hotel are good, our rate had continenatl breakfast included but we never made it down in time for this preferring to get a more leisurely brunch at some of the local cafes.The hotel is within walking distance of Oxford street and the walk down is very pleasant alongside the park.We found an excellent restaurant called the island about a block away from the corus down towards lancaster gate, could not rate highly enough the food was excellent.overall good stay would go back but only if they added air con!!!"
198,662,"Aug 27 2007 	Hot Rooms But Clean!	I have stayed at this hotel once before at the end of June and forgot to write a review. I was lucky to get a room at all because it was Wimbledon week! I had to pay 150 for a standard room as it was booked on the same day and it looks like this might be the &quot;walk in&quot; price. I stayed here again in August and paid 80 through Lastminute.com (for the same room).The hotel is very central to Lancaster Gate - just a few minutes walk. This is very convenient as it is only 10 minutes or less on the tube to Oxford Street, and not far from Paddington either.The hotel is nice and the reception staff friendly. My room was clean, a nice size, and comfortable. My only complaint (like everyone else) was the heat! You walk into the room and start sweating! There isn't any air conditioning. It is ok if you put the fan on and go out for a while. However, I have found the fan is rather noisy and switched it off when I went to sleep...only to wake up very hot! I knew it would be like this after my previous stay, however, it was the cheapest hotel, with clean rooms, close to Paddington and central that I could find with less than a week to book and not hugely put down on TripAdvisor."
199,662,"Aug 25 2007 	Modern comfort	OutlineThe hotel stay was for 4 nights mid week, booked by my company due to the central locationTravelThe hotel is on the block next to Lancaster Gate underground station so litterally 60 seconds walk from there. If you are travelling by car to london, you can avoid the congestion charge getting there but parking is limited to a single yellow line outside the hotel where you can only park between 6:30pm and 8:30am. Nearest car park is 10mins walk away and costs 22 for 24 hours.ArrivalThe hotel's entrance is perfectly acceptable and gives a good impression of the hotel. It is clean, modern and stylish. On the ground floor there is a concierge service, reception, bar, lounge and restaurant. Once you check in, you are expected to make your own way to your room. Thats ok as it's simple to find your room and I prefer not to tip a porter for carring my wheeled suitcase 50 yards.RoomRoom are generally small, but very well maintained and styled. They have 7 coat hangers, but more are available on request. The rooms are made up everyday for you. Tea and coffee facilities are provided in the room. There is plently of plug sockets, handy if you have a mobile phone, laptop, hairdryer, straightners ect. There is a fan mounted to the ceiling as they don't have air conditioning. The fan is slightly noisy for a fan, but acceptable is you adjust the angle of the fan slightly.FoodA full english breakfast is provided on the lower ground floor and continental breakfast on the ground floor. I always had the full english breakfast. I found the scrambled egg particularly nice as they were not microwaved, rather made in a pan with milk. The bacon was the only downside being rather dry. At night there is a English or Malaysian choice of food in the restaurant where is the service is brilliant and attentive. Alternatively you can eat in the lounge and choose from english favourites such as beef burger and chips. If you do choose from this you wont be disappointed as it's no McDonalds burger, but a prime beef steak on a toasted bun with stilton cheese. Delicious.Value for moneyThe hotel room is an average value considering the prime location of the hotel, however I found the cost of food and drinks quite expensive considering the pub next door offers drinks and food similar in quality but at a much lower cost. Overall experienceI found the hotel modern, clean, stylish and worth the money. The staff would endeavour to acheive any request you made and the concierge service splendid. I would reccomend this hotel to people who are looking for a place to stay whilst on a short trip for business or pleasure to central London"
200,662,"Aug 24 2007 	Not as good as last year!	We stayed at the Corus last year, and as everything went fine, we decided to use it again. However, despite booking two doubles, we were informed that none were available except for in the basement which sounded like the overspill! So we were given twins instead. The notice on the side advertising Double's with AC left me with the distinct impression there were double's still available, but as I had an hour to get over to Wembley. I didn't have time to argue.The room was as expected, but the en-suite was tiny, and you had to shower sideways! It was also a smoking floor (fifth) but I can't remember if the website we used gives you an option so I won't hold it against the hotel!Finally, a good point - the breakfast, as last year, was a big plus - plenty to eat setting you up for a manic day in our fine capital!"
201,662,"Aug 24 2007 	Good hotel with flaws	I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park hotel from the 16th to the 19th of August for an extended weekend trip with my wife. We had a good stay in the hotel but there were some flaws.First of all: The location of the hotel is close to perfect. Very near to Lancaster Gate tube station on Central Line that in a few minutes will bring you to Oxford Circus which is in the heart of London. The hotel itself is pretty decent for a short stay. I found the staff in the reception to be courteous and efficient and the lobby/bar area to be quite well. My room was a different matter. The first thing that welcomed us when we opened the door was a distinct odeur of sewer!! As other reviewers have told the the room was also cramped and hot. Most of these problems were solved by opening the window (there was no A/C).The breakfast included in our room was a joke: Bread, butter, ham, cornflakes and some canned fruit. I don't think I have forgotten anything. The breakfast was clearly designed to get clients to pay (approx. 8 ) to upgrade to the english breakfast downstairs (which we did). I saw some pictures of the executive rooms that looked much better than our room. Maybe the english breakfast is also included when you book those rooms?"
202,662,Aug 23 2007 	Not much space	The Corus Hotel Hyde Park is in a nice section of London. Having been to London several times I realize that rooms are small but for $200 I expected something larger than 15' x 18'. The room was quite hot and stuffy with no air conditioning.
203,662,"Aug 11 2007 	Skip the continental breakfast	My husband and I stayed at the Corus for 5 nights in May, 2007. The location is fantastic; right near the tube and across the street from the park. The room is small. I knew this going in, but was still suprised by just how small it was. The bed was ok, but the pillows are a bit like mini futons cushions (very firm and dense). I've since heard this is how pillows are in Britain. The continental breakfast was included in our price, but I would skip it if staying there again. They had the same spread daily (cheese, ham, stale croissant, bad coffee, juices, cereal), and it was a bit tiring after several days. On the upside, the room was clean, the temperature was fine (we were not in an air conditioned room), and it was generally pretty quiet."
204,662,Aug 1 2007 	Great for a weekend	I stayed here early in the month. The room was very compact but had everything you need and was clean and nicely decorated. Location is great with lots of bars and restaurants near by.This hotel is great for a weekend hotel when you wont spend much time in. Great Value if this is what your after. Only downside was the room got really hot with only a little fan which didnt help much
205,662,Jul 30 2007 	great hotel	after reading some of the reviews on here we were a little worried what we would get we arrive at 4pm checked straight into the room and was happy with the outcome the lobby and staff were very pleasant and helpful. the breakfast (full english ) was lovely plenty of food and choice and quick service nice pleasant dining room. our room was an excutive i would recommend these rooms for the extra money you can upgrade when you arrive for 30 which would be worth doing the other rooms are small and cramped we had air conditioning in ours tea /coffee ahairdryer trouser press and iron + board. bathroom a decent size with bath and shower. would definately stay at this hotel again ! location is brilliant 2 minute walk to lancaster gate underground and hyde park straight opposite the hotel. nice pub to the side of the hotel called the swan nice food and beer. all in all a good weekend break !
206,662,"Jul 20 2007 	Hated the Bed	I stayed at the Corus twice in March and April 2007. They must have been under booked as they gave me a big roomy room with a roomy bathroom, an air conditioning with a heating option (came very much in handy) and a TV that was close enough to the bed to watch it from there. Only gripe is the bed itself - the side of the matteress which apparantly everybody used to get up from (as the other side was close to a wall) was lower and sloping from over-use (and must be a cheap mattress as well) - I had to be careful not to accidetally slide right off the bed in the middle of the night!Nice thing was that they gave away me entire two adapters for my electronics at reception at no charge - apparently some tourists must have left them behind.One other gripe is that when I did not feel like paying for and eating a big breakfast, and just wanted a cappuchino and a muffin, there aren't any coffee shops like Starbucks or Nero around unless you walk 20 minutes or take the bus or tube into Oxford Street or Notting Hill."
207,662,"Jul 18 2007 	Trendy interior	We flew into London from the USA, requiring to stay one night before moving on to the rest of the UK. As we arrived early, after an overnight flight, we were allowed to go straight into our room. The room was as the photos had showed, modern headboard and space saving furniture. The bathroom was small, but immaculate, compactly presented. We travel a lot and have learned how to read between the lines of a hotel description. The hotel was exactly as we expected, light, modern decor, excellent dinner served by Polish staff, and very friendly receptionists. We would recommend it to anyone coming to London for mainly sight-seeing purposes."
208,662,"Jul 10 2007 	Convenient hotel	We stayed two nights at the Corus Hyde Park in late May. It was part of a buy the flight-get two nights accomodation package with British Airways. Check-in was handled smoothly and we were allowed to check-in before the official time--wonderful for us, since we had flown all night and gotten to London in the early morning. The staff was polite and helpful; the room small but clean and adequate. Location could not have been better, with quick access to the tube and buses. A pleasant surprise was the on-site restaurant where we ate one night (we were just too exhausted to look for anywhere else). The food was great; the service excellent and the price moderate. We would likely stay here again, depending on the price and the date of our trip. The lack of air conditioning did not bother us this trip since it was cold and raining when we were there."
209,662,"Jul 9 2007 	Worse hotel experience. Stay away!!!	Booked a double-room through the Corus hotel website but when I got there they told me they did not have anymore double-room left!!?? They did have my reservation but somehow they told me they didn't have the double-room I booked and I thought that was ridiculous. They finally found me a twin room but the room was horrible. The bathroom stinks, the water on both the sink and bathtub did not go down and the shower did not work. Don't be deceived by the grand lobby. The room is old and disgusting. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is just 3 mins walk to the Lancaster Gate subway stop and that's about it."
210,662,"Jul 5 2007 	Great location but no air conditioning!!!!!	We stayed at the Corus in June and we generally pleased. The location is lovely with the park across the road. Very convenient to tube. Rooms very modern but small, but not a problem. The only problem was how hot it was in the room. We requested an upgrade as they have signs at reception saying that for 30 pounds you can be upgraded to an air conditioned room. The signs say it all as so many people were complaining about the heat in their rooms. We were unable to upgrade as there were no more rooms available. It was unbearable on the first night and the next day we asked for the window to be opened and had to sign a form to say that we take responsibility for lost goods etc. This made a big difference. The room became bearable, but bathroom was hot after a shower. Very nice ammenties in the hotel and if you can survive the heat it is a good hotel!!"
211,662,"Jun 15 2007 	Flash outside Small rooms OK location	The hotel is located about 50m from Lancaster Gate Tube. The outside and lobby are very grand. The reception staff are friendly and quick.Three very quick lifts get you to one of the ten floors of rooms. There are about 50 rooms per floor. The room I stayed in was very small although for 30 you can upgrade (I didn't). My room was long and narrow (see the photos from another review). The bed was comftable. There is a rail to hang your clothes but no cupboards. Tea/coffee was in the room along with a biscuit. There is a TV with verybasic channels but it is located at the opposite end of the bedroom to the bed and high up on the wall. No exactly easy watching as it was a small TV. The bathroom was small but clean. No where to put your stuff. There is a safe in the room. If you are only staying for a short time and expect to out most of the time then this would be OK. Being on the Central line underground you are able to get anywhere you want. It is only 1 stop away from the start of Oxford Street/Marble Arch. There is a pub next door which does food but seems to shut around 11pm. Breakfast is OK but not special. Free newspapers in the lobby and breakfast room. Seemed to take a few coach parties so breakfast was very busy at times (earlier you go thequitier it was). Has a PC in the lobby for net access but quite dear at 10p per Min. Would I stay again? Not sure. Hotels around Euston are better value and have larger rooms. Ended up here because I had booked late. If you like flash on the outside and small rooms then I suppose it would be OK, but I think that the IBIS in Euston is better VFM."
212,662,"May 29 2007 	Great Choice	This is a great option in London. Good location. Can easily walk from here to many central attractions. It is also conveniently located a few minutes away from Lancaster Gate tube station if wanting to go farther afield. Friendly, helpful staff. Good, full english breakfast (included in our room rate, but, not always I don't think). Rooms were small, but, I was expecting this from previous reviews. However, they had everything you needed for a few nights stay. They were nice and clean and I found the bed to be really comfortable. No AC, just a wall mounted fan. Could be a bit uncomfortable if there in the height of summer. If you can get a room for the right price, I think this hotel is a really good option for a London trip. Would definitely stay there again."
213,662,"May 27 2007 	Good choice in London	My girlfriend and I stayed there for five nights, it's our seventh stay in London and the best one. We finally found hotel that doesn't have claustrophobic rooms. Location couldn't be better and continental breakfast view is fantastic, you are seating on Bayswater Road and watching Hyde Park across. Rooms are very clean and newly refurbished. Staff at reception is very polite and helpful and price for room is very reasonable.We'll stay there next time definitely when we are in London."
214,662,"May 20 2007 	not the best and nicer places to stay.....	first they couldnt find my reservation and there was no trace of me on the computer, in the end i had to show them &quot;THIER&quot; booking confirmation after i had prnted it out from my email ( you have to pay for the internet access) other wise i would have been charged a full rate..... yes the room was small, but i knew this from other reviews, the room smelt musty but was otherwise clean, it had no AC or a fan, even thought there was a fan electrical switch.  i asked for an iron and ironing board as the iron in the room was broken. The thing that arrived was in a disgusting state, fat/grease on the base of the iron and the board cover had so many stains on it it was unbelievable - i would be ashamed of presenting something like that to a hotel guest.the bathroom is small but adequate, not enough light near the mirror though, the drain for the shower was partly blocked so after a few minutes there was about 5 cm of water in the base, the shower head holder kept sliding down the rail and the head would fall out of the holder. also no where to put your shower wash so you have to either hold it or put it in the water by your feet, also no extraction fan in the bathroom.in the morning housekeeping kept knocking on the door despite the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign and also being told that i would leave the room at the check out time.You could also easily hear the lift going up and down, doors closing etc, which isnt too nice if you are trying to sleep!!! in short I wont stay there again or recommend it to anyone when i left I found another hotel just a few yadrs from the hotel called elysee - i had a quick look in one of the rooms and its better and larger than the corus and a lot cheaper! i know which hotel ill be trying next!!!"
215,662,"May 18 2007 	Great Location!	Great Location, minutes walk from Oxford Street. Clean hotel but really small rooms, hardly enough room to move around. The breakfast menu was very limited but the location made up for everything. Fabulous place to stay and explore the city!"
216,662,"Apr 22 2007	Simple hotel	Location for this hotel is not too bad, opposite the Hyde Park, about 3mins walk to Lancaster Gate tube station, 15mins walk to Marble arch. Now for the room, this is the first time I visited a European country so I was really taken aback when I saw my room! I've seen the pictures taken by the other reviewers; I would say that my room is much smaller than theirs. I would say it is pathetically small for the price I'm paying for, if I were to book a hotel in Asia for that price! The bathroom is terribly small, come to think about it, it's even smaller than my workstation in my office! However, I know that hotels in European country only provides basic amenities, so I cant grumble much for a land scarce metropolitan country like London. Overall, London is a really fantastic country to visit but the hotel is really disappointing."
217,662,Apr 22 2007 	OK All in All	Reception staff efficient. Room quite satisfactory. In-hotel breakfasts were excellent. Concierge service top-notch (we used it tobook passage on the chunnel train for the busy Easter period and to get info on bus transport to Westminster Abbey and the Imperial War Museum). Nearest ATM is about two blocks away near the Underground station. Hotel location at the far end of Hyde Park is not within walking distance to the major London tourist attractions.
218,662,"Apr 21 2007	Great reception and bar scruffy rooms	I spent one night at the Corus Hotel Hyde Park on a business trip to London. The hotel is in a great location for leisure and business and the reception area, bar and breakfast room are fantastic. However the rooms are a bit disappointing. I was upgraded to a suite as the executive rooms had been double-booked, but it wasn't factastic. The bedroom, sitting area and bathroom were huge but very scruffy and a little dated, with stained sheets and a broken shower curtain. The TV was also tiny - only a minor thing but most 4 star hotels now offer flat screen or larger TVs."
219,662,"Apr 17 2007 	Excellent Hotel !!!	I ve stayed at the Corus Hyde park hotel, twice. First time during xmas 2004 and second time during xmas 2006. Both times I was VERY pleased with my stay there. The location is ideal. Right next to Hyde park ( you might even get a room with a view facing the park), a posh residential area withing walkin distance of Oxford st. and Lancaster gate tube station just a 5 min walk away (btw central line is a very convenient line). The two rooms that I ve stayed in were completely different regarding the decoration, but both of them were very nice.Both very modern, clean, and quite spacious.I ve stayed in a couple of other hotels in central London and the Corus is by far the best one. I ll probably stay there at my next trip as well."
220,662,"Apr 15 2007 	Great value and comfort for longer stay	Stayed here for two weeks with partner when relocating to London from elsewhere in the UK. Was upgraded to Executive room which was a reasonable size, quiet and very clean. Can't fault this hotel for value (around 80 double b&amp;b) and location. Breakfast is also pretty good."
221,662,"Apr 3 2007 	Brill except for...	The hotel itself is really very nice...we got a budget room, which was plenty big enough, clean as a whistle and had everything we needed for a nights stay in London. I mean, the view wasn't great, but seeing as we got a 4* hotel so cheap we weren't complaining! It's close to many restaurants and right next to the tube for easy access to the sights. The staff were friendly, helpful and very efficient when the fire alarm went off just before midnight. This in itself wasn't an issue...at least we knew the fire alarm worked! What really almost ruined our stay was the rude member of staff that knocked on our door, after everyone was allowed back into the hotel, and accused US of setting it off!! He didn't believe that we were asleep when the alarm went off and we received no apology from him when the Firemen even confirmed that it was a fault in the system and not us! I complained the next morning to a very apologetic man on reception. Other than this one individual, I would reccommend the hotel to anyone visiting London for a clean, safe and well located stay."
222,662,"Mar 29 2007	Perfect location lovely little hotel	Booked this hotel via a trip deal with British Airways (after checking the TripAdvisor reviews of course!). This place is IDEALLY located. It is within 5 minutes of the Lancaster Gate tube station, which is on the Central Line and connects to the other tube lines easily. It is across the street from gorgeous Hyde Park, which is a must-visit. In Hyde Park you can visit Kensington Palace and have tea at the Orangery (highly recommended!). There are plenty of great restaurants near the Corus hotel as well, all within walking distance.The room was surprisingly large (by European standards of course) and well designed. My mom is an interior designer and she commented that the space planning for the room was excellent. The furnishings looked fairly recent and in good condition. We lucked out with a view of a couryard garden. I will say, though, the walls are thin, so if you are a light sleeper and are situated next to noisy neighbors, you are going to wish you had earplugs.The staff was so helpful and attentive! They even warned us about the very high cost of making outgoing phone calls from the room, and offered to assist us in dialing out from the pay phone on more than one occasion. We also had to ask for an ironing board/iron and it was delivered to the room within 5 minutes!The continental breakfast was okay...croissants, ham, cheese, jam, and juice/coffee/tea. Nothing fancy, but the food tasted good.The only complaint I had was that one set of bathtowels looked &quot;past its prime&quot;--the edges were fraying and it was not very absorbant. The other set of towels was fine.Bring an electrical adapter as you will need one for a curling iron or iPod charger, etc.I have photos of the room, too...will attempt to upload them later."
223,662,"Mar 26 2007 	Small but ideal!!!	I visited the Corus Hyde Park from the 15th to the 17th of febuary with my boyfriend.I had booked it online mainly because of the low price and the decent reviews i had read.We flew to stansted,got the stansted xpress to liverpool st and then the tube to Lancaster gate.The hotel was a 2minute walk from the tube and looked over the park.The staff were very friendly and although we had checked in early took care of our luggage so we didnt have to wait around.When we checked into our room we got a bit of a shock at the size but to be fair the room was obviously recently and modernly decorated and was spotlessly clean.Although our room was only a double it literally couldnt of fit more than the two of us!But the linen was spotless,there were tea making facilities and a tv and desk.The bathroom was tiny but we were ot in london to stay in the hotel.The breakfast was perfect really good choice and replenished often.Although id recommend heading down early so as not to waste time waiting.All in all the Corus Hyde Park was a perfect tourist hotel. Right beside a tube station and tourist spot and clean wth friendly staff!Id definately recommend although perhaps not to those who prefer lots of space!!"
224,662,"Mar 24 2007 	Good deal	Stayed here for 4 nights, 2 of which were free from a British Airways promotion (the other 2 nights we booked through Octopus travel for 172/night). Given the price and location we were very pleased. Staff was very helpful, room was clean and modern, housekeeping respected the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door, and location was great. Yes, room is small, but not much smaller than the room we stayed at last year at the Nikko hotel. Hotel rooms in London are notoriously small. We arrived around 10am after an international flight and were given an early check in, for which we were extremely grateful. Over the weekend the breakfast room was a bit chaotic, but things were kept stocked, and during the week it was much less crowded. Breakfast was acceptable, but not great - we just had the continental breakfast that was included, and did not upgrade to the English breakfast. Really nice views of the park from the breakfast room. Just a block from the Lancaster Gate tube station, directly across from Hyde Park, and an easy walk to Paddington station. Easy to get around town via the tube or bus, but we were able to walk to a lot of places. Given the cost and location this was a great deal for us, and we would stay there again."
225,662,Mar 1 2007 	Good Hotel Good Price	Booked this hotel for 95 via BMI website for myself and 3 work colleagues. Stayed in small single rooms 9th floor for 3 nights. Rooms were very clean and modern with all that you need for a work trip. Breakfast was more than good. I did not spend a lot of time in the hotel but the reception area is very pleasant and no complaints about staff. Would recommend to friends.
226,662,"Feb 25 2007 	Perfect location for the price	While the room was incredibly small, the location was perfect. The bus stop was a minute away, and 2 minutes by bus to Marble Arch. Lancaster Gate station was close but was closed during our trip. The amenities were decent, relatively new. There were a few hardware problems with the door and switches, but they were soon fixed. The hotel was clean, the reception was nice. Again, best part was the location at the price. There was a good general store (where you could get everything) and a pub right next to the hotel. Would stay there again."
227,662,"Feb 20 2007 	Overpriced and Pants!	Arrived at the hotel on Friday, and to be honest it looks very impressive from the exterior, and the location is also good.Unfortunately, these positive points were soon to be outweighed by negatives...We had booked two 'executive' rooms, which to our dismay didn't fit that description. They were small and pokey, with grubby carpets, grubby 'pilled' blankets on the bed (no quilt) and cheap plastic teamaking facilities you'd expect at a B&amp;B in Blackpool.The bathroom was basic, though clean, dating back to probably the 1970's...complete with 'yellowed' shower mat..available at any Argos for 9.99. Liked the 1980's 12'' black portable television though..blended in well with the decor.Overall, the room resembled a tired, worn B&amp;B rather than a FOUR STAR!! London Hotel. Really...How the hell did they achieve this rating.??.was the assesor a) On the payrollb) Ray Charlesc) On crackThe rooms are advertised as 'Laura Ashley Inspired'...this is confined to the grubby bed throw, and a more apt description would be 'Big Issue inspired'.You can probaly tell by now, we were less than impressed.and don't think we're hard to please..far from it (we're from Birmingham for God's sake!), but we have stopped in a few 4-5 star hotels in the likes of Cologne Barcelona, Pague etc..Corus Hyde Park does not even come close to the standards offered by these cities...imagine what foreign visitors may think? Embarrasing.After stark realisation that things were not as they should have been, we went to the front desk, and pointed out that our rooms were less than satisfactory. I also gestured to a large plasma screen in the lobby, which advertised the standard 'Laura Ashley' rooms, which looked quite modern and appealing. I thought that these may be located in another part of the hotel, and may be better than our 'executive' rooms.The guy at the front desk nodded sympathetically and explained that all central London hotels are like this (what..crap?), and the rooms advertised on the plasma were subject to 'confusing camera angles'.in other words..just as bad. No offer was made for alternative accomodation elsewhere, in fact nothing was offered...we were really being told to 'put up, or shut up'.We personally paid 109.00 per room, per night, EX. breakfast...my advice....find a travel lodge, which you will find much better value and service."
228,662,"Feb 20 2007	Great Hotel Fantsatic Location!!	I stayed here with my husband on the 27th and 28th of February, and we were extremely happy :)) This was my second time staying here. The Hotel, is finished to a high standard, with very friendly, helpful staff. Our bedroom, although maybe a little smaller than some of the others, was modern, clean, warm, and comfortable. We had a choice of Cooked or continental breakfast, and although it was quite busy on the Sunday morning, we were seated fairly quickly. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just across the road from Hyde Park, a beautiful sapace in such a busy city. On Sunday mornings the Bayswater Road Market takes place on the other side of the road, with art and sculpture on the park railings, lovely to walk along and look at. The area that the hotel is in is full of lovely old houses, a very pretty location. The Hotel is only 5 minutes walk from Lancaster Gate Tube Station.  I would definately recomend this hotel to anyone, be it for a family holiday, a romantic weekend, business, this is a great hotel to stay in with a great location. I booked with hotel direct website and got great discount on room rates."
229,662,"Feb 12 2007	a nice place	I stayed here last year, and am staying again here on feb 14/07it came with my flight booking.i chose it from amongst several othersIt is clean, basic, was remodeled like a year or so ago.what more do you need it has a a little coffee maker, and a hairdryer IT is a small room compared with American hotels its in a good part of Londonyou are in London to have fun not spend a lot of time in the hotel right!just for showering and sleeping i have never had a problemthe people who work there are very nice"
230,662,"Feb 8 2007	Simple clean cheap and convenient	I read the reviews for this hotel before booking and they seemed like a mixed bag. I can only say that my experience has been very good for this hotel. Booking in was easy, with polite staff. The hotel looks as though it has had a recent makeover - its very clean, fresh and open in the entrance way. The room was also very good. I was in 734 overlooking Craven Road. Although outside was a bit noisy (not really the hotels fault), a pair of ear plugs solved that little problem. It may be a tad small, but for one night, it suited me fine. The bed was comfortable, tea/coffee facilities were available, the bathroom was clean with complimentary toiletries and the TV managed to get the main UK channels. I had the continental breakfast in the morning. The basics are covered, cereal, croissants, tea/coffee or juice. Not inspiring but did me OK for breakfast. I have looked for a good / cheap hotel in a central and convenient location in London for ages and it looks like I have found it. I would definately use this hotel again and would have no problem recommending it to anyone who wasnt staying for very long."
231,662,"Jan 30 2007	Excellent value clean perfect location	My partner and I have just returned from a one night stay in the Corus Hyde Park Hotel, after some of the reviews I had read I was getting a little nervous as to what to expect - which proved unfounded. The hotel has just gone through a 12.5m refurbishment and it is obvious the moment you walk in the door, it is clean and bright and very well appointed, the reception staff greeted with a warm smile and were very efficient and friendly, and the staff on the Concierge desk could not have been better at helping with any queries you may have - even giving us a large map of London with a discount of 20% for up to six people at many attractions and restaurants - this had a price of 2.95 on the cover but no charge was made.The room we were allocated was on the side of the building, immaculate and obviously refurbished, the bed was comfortable and as has been said before - ironing board and trouser press, there is also a room safe which unusually was free to use, the room was not massive but perfect for our visit, the hand basin in the bathroom was very small but big enough for its intended use, you do not go to London to sit in the bedroom! If I were to stay in the summer months I would go for the upgrade with the AC as I am sure it will get very warm in the room. Breakfast was of the Continental type which was adequate for our needs but you are able to upgrade to cooked breakfast if you wish.The hotel is in a superb location - immediately opposite Hyde Park - which is a beautiful place to go for a walk and see the lake, Italian Fountains and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, at the far end of the park is the Royal Albert Hall - which is where we were headed in the evening to see the wonderful Cirque du Soliel production of Alegria - and the truly magnificent Albert Memorial opposite.Lancaster Gate tube station is 250 yards away from the hotel and we got 5.10 tickets on arrival in London which permits unlimited use of zones 1 &amp; 2 between the hours of 0930 and 0430, single trip tickets are 4 each. we had a really good two days in London - taking the trip on the Thames City Cruises boats on the second day down to Greenwich and return - a trip which I can thoroughly recommend.When we go down to London again we will definitely stay at the Corus Hyde Park for the reasons outlined above"
232,662,Jan 27 2007 	Small rooms but they have what you need.	Not bad. It was clean and there was what you needed in the room. Strange arrangement though - I was on the 7th floor but the window was on the fourth floor from the outside - wierd!! The rooms were small and claustrophopic. Small window high up. I changed from a room overlooking the inside to on on the external elevation which was slightly better inside but a bit noisy.The service was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fine. For 99 incl of english breakfast in Central London I would say not bad value.
233,662,Jan 19 2007	Never again!	6' by 10 Yes that is correct a closet for a single room and no air conditioning. Although the 12&quot; television was nice.... Furious I was moved to an &quot;Executive&quot; room for about 60.00 usd more. The front desk staff was typically dis-interested; I did find the concierge and the bar-maids in the lobby very helpful and fun. I will post pictures soon. Frankly I found the smaller Inn style lodging in London much more desirable.
234,662,"Jan 19 2007	Clean Modern Great value for money!	I have stayed at this hotel twice and would thoroughly recommend it to tourists visiting London for the first time through to locals who are just having a weekend in the city.The Corus represents excellent value for money and although the rooms are a little on the small side, everything you need is here. The rooms are clean, comfortable and have a modern look. When in London, you will spend so much of your time out of your room, this just makes a great place to rest your head.If you can go for the cooked breakfast, please do, the choice is excellent and the mushrooms are delicious - you will also find a continental selection here included in the price.They also have a good restaurant and bar in the hotel, ideal for a spot of pre theatre dinner. A stone's throw from all the major attractions and just opposite Hyde Park, I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone."
235,662,"Jan 6 2007 	Super hotel	The rooms are relatively small but there is everything you needed and more (ironing board, PlayStation). Despite the small size of the room, everything has been well thought out and organized. I stayed at the Corus twice. It is conveniently located near Lancaster Gate tube station and Hyde Park."
236,662,"Dec 31 2006 	Not a four star!	It was not a four star hotel! Maybe a three star, but I will discuss that with the travel agent. I thought the staff was particularly nice. we we there for the week before Christmas and so it was cold, at least for us Alabamians. My room was particularly cold and they immediately brought us another heater, inaddition to the wall heater. The East European man, that was just learning the English language, helped alot. He was very polite. Our continental breakfast was good...the rolls would have been nice warmed but we adjusted to this style of breakfast. I was glad that they could exchange currenct. Because we left on Christmas morning, and the taxi cast &quot;double&quot; so we had to get more pounds! Being close to the Lancaster Station was nice but using the Tube is Okay but I was suggest using the double decker, too, you get a better feel for the city and its layout. Taxis are elegant--at least to us from the United States. The hotel i s located in a very good area. Little restaurants are all around...no one seemed to eat at the Hotel restuarant. The bar was good....the lobby was cold and unfriendly. The computer was very slow but the hotel helped me use the telephone--gave good directions. All in all, we didn't spend much time in the hotel and our room was always clean. I can't complain, too much."
237,662,"Dec 20 2006 	Great Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for three nights Fri, Sat and Sun nights. The hotel is a stone's throw from the Lancaster Gate Tude station so very easily accessible.The hotel lobby is a nice area with bar and restaurant and seemed very clean and tidy at all times.After reading some of the write ups (after we had booked and paid) we were a little concerned but I have to say the hotel was fine. The only downside to the stay was that the rooms are admittedly quite small - but saying that, they are well furnished and unless you were going to London to sit in the room, why would you need anything larger!?Overall I would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10."
238,662,"Dec 10 2006 	No elevator to access the room at the botton of the hotel with an ugly view	To get to the room, that it was at the botton of the hotel and with an ugly view to a dirty courtyard , we had to carry our baggage through a very narrow stairs because there was no elevator (I have post photos of the stairs) more appropiate of a one star hotel. This was not the kind of service that we expected in this hotel."
239,662,"Dec 6 2006 	Great LONDON Hotel	After reading the previous reviews, and having stayed in the hotel, it seems many do not understand that this is a 3-star LONDON hotel. Yes, the rooms are small, but the prices are low. I found the hotel to be around average in decor and the staff was very friendly. The &quot;cozy&quot; rooms were really what I expected out of a London hotel. In another city, the size would have been unacceptable. However, the room was tidy and well kept-up. The location is fantastic and I would definitely stay here again."
240,662,"Dec 1 2006 	Great location	The hotel was in a fab location, very very very close to lancaster gate underground, opposite the magnificant Hyde Park. I was travelling with a friend from work, we had booked to see WICKED the musical (AWESOME). We arrived at the hotel at approx 12.20 afternoon, we had been told we wouldn't be able to check in till 2.30, however, we upgraded our twin room to an executive room, this was ready on arrival, GREAT!!!!!! The room was very small but clean all the same, one problem though, it was really boiling. Air con didn't really work, opened the window and hoped for the best, had no time to start complaining. When we got back it had cooled down, breakfast was very good and in a light airy room.Would I stay there again???? Most definatly xx"
241,662,"Nov 21 2006 	good location	But for the Lancaster Gate Station being closed for repairs, the hotel had an ideal location. A few minutes by taxi/Bus and you are in Oxford Street. On the opposite side, near the Queensway subway are a choice of Chinese restaurants that are very popular. Good food!The rooms were narrow with modern furnishings. it was quite small and had no closets. Just a few hangers outside. So families will have a tough time but conveninent for business travelers. Bathroom was neat with a small wash area. The room did not have a mini bar. The coffee machine was appreciated. A little small if couples go on a holiday!Would i stay there again? maybe.... but then again, i like to stay in different hotels each time to get an idea of the locality, its surroundings etc. The best thing about the Corus- bang opposite Hyde Park and its serene surroundings!"
242,662,Nov 13 2006	naughty weekend	I was met by a cheery guy at the desk who was friendly enough. Got to my room which was pretty small. The bathroom had damp patches on the celling and the double bed had stains on the actual bed. The hair dryer in the bathroom was also hanging off the wall.Thankfully we had put the sleep sign on the door as the room service women came round to the other rooms at 0830 to clean them. So if you do visit this hotel and want a lay in i recommend doing the same!!! When we returned back at 4pm the room still had not been cleaned from when we had left at 11am. No clean towels and the breakfast dishes and other room service plates were also still in the room.In the room there was nothing about the facilities the hotel had or what drinks you could order. There was no leaflets or booklets on what to do in London. One good thing about the hotel was that the consierge gave us the telephone number for Dominos pizza!!
243,662,"Nov 13 2006 	Noisy small rooms and poor service	My girlfiend and I decide to stay at the Corus Hyde Park due to the location and what were thought to be a reasonable price. Although the room was only a place to stay the night whislt we did the sightseeing thing in London, it was not even suitable to get a decent sleep due to the noise from the road. Even the windows coudn't be shut properly to try and reduce the sound of cars all night. To top it all off the management accused us of ordring a round of drinks when we weren't even in the hotel when the drinks were ordered. The people who ordered the drinks also managed to obtain my surnmane to sign for the drinks so how they got this is very strange. It makes you wonder what sort of security measures are in place for someone to obtain these details."
244,662,"Nov 2 2006 	love this hotel	my wife and me stayed at this hotel for 10 days , i was concernabout this hotel after reading some reviews ,but i found it great place .rooms are small, but no big deal it was clean ,modern and very good location over view hydepark.inroom safe box.we could also walke to oxford street 15mins.onlyqweenway road also within walking distance .where you can find restrant , (MnS)shops,cafeslancster gate station was closed but paddington station was5 mins walke. also staff of this hotel are very friendly, especialy room service staffi would go back to this hotel"
245,662,"Oct 31 2006 	Just Okay (Pros and Cons)	My boyfriend and I stayed at Corus and here are our comments:Pros:- good location (if they would open the lancaster tube spot). It was closed when we went in Aug 2006- clean, no bugs- nice view of the park- good value for money (considering you're in London)Cons:- too noisy to sleep if you are facing the street. Try to get other side that doesn't face the street- small rooms, but it was not a problem- no towels...they had a problem with laundry when we stayed.- staff told us our room wasn't ready-had to speak with manager to get it sorted (they gave us an upgrade)- standard accomodations and nothing more- some staff members seemed uninterested in our concernsOverall:I would stay at Corus again if they opened the nearby tube station. It was safe, clean, and it had a nice location. I would ask for another room next time so I can avoid the noise from the street. * Try Corus if you're not too picky* Don't expect luxury* Very basic, the room serves its purpose (a place to sleep)"
246,662,"Oct 4 2006 	Small and Stuffy but served the purpose!	Our room was courtesy of British Airways so can't complain too very much. After a 9 hour flight with no sleep on the flight - a cot would have served our purpose. However, I would not purposely book this hotel having been there. The room was small and stuff-with no AC or breeze in the windows. However, it is conveniently located across the street from Hyde Park which provided us with a lovely walk and tour of Kensington Palace. Reception was a bit cool and check in staff was confused about our arrangement with BA - but they finally figured it out and checked us into our room. The continental breakfast brought to our door the next morning was just what we needed to start off our day-included in tariff. Olio-the restaurant on premises - was tasty but overpriced in my opinion. The closest tube station was under construction so we used Paddington Sta. which was a longer walk that we would have liked. Again - long flight and no sleep. I must say that Kensington Park was our saving grace as it is quite lovely and we did enjoy our stroll through the park."
247,662,"Oct 3 2006 	Great location great staff decent room	As a lone, female traveler, my week long stay at Corus Hotel Hyde Park was pleasant.Since I arrived in the summer, I ended up upgrading my room just so I could have AC (much needed). The hallways are hot and muggy. Besides that, the room was neat, the bathrooms clean and the continental breakfast decent. If you need to eat your meat in the mornings (sausages, bacon, etc.), then upgrade to the full english breakfast.The location of the hotel is wonderful. It's within minutes, walking distance to the Lancaster Gate tube, a 5-10 minute stroll to the Paddington tube and train station, it's across the street from the center of Hyde Park. If you've the time, forego the dirty air and crowds of the tube and take in the fresh air and beautiful scenery of the park and nearby neighborhoods.If I've the chance to go back, I wouldn't mind revisiting this hotel."
248,662,"Aug 30 2006 	Not as bad as the usual London hotel	My wife and I stayed in London for a few days in July and chose this hotel based on the Tripadvisor ratings, as we have had bad experiences in the past... Overall, it was a mixed experience, but clean and well located. It would have been even better if the underground station nearby hadn't been closed for renovation (it will be for a while!). Despite an outside temperature in the mid 20's C, the temperature of the stale air in the hallway was around 35C and in the tiny room not much less - while the window would open a whopping 10 cm. Air conditioned rooms were also available at a 30% premium for those who want to be able to sleep in the room. There was a fan installed that allows to drown out any possible traffic noise with its sleeve bearing turbine sound while reshuffling the heat inside the room.The breakfast buffet makes up in price what it misses in choice, so don't bother. There are a lot of cheap little places around in the neighbourhood that offer more choices and have character.On the upside, the area is really nice with Kensington Gardens across the street and pubs and restaurants abound. It is very easy to reach due to the proximity to Paddington Station (and thus Heathrow), walking distance with a trolley suitcase or a 5 GBP cab ride. At milder temperatures this would be a good value overall and we would perhaps even go back, but not to the entry level room."
249,662,"Aug 10 2006 	Compact room is an understatement	As mentioned previously the hotel is a very welcoming one, and the location is great. However the rooms are the really small to the point we could'nt open one of our suitcases. There is no air con and a fan that blows warm air around the room.. Shop around you could get a more spacious room for less money.. Please be aware you can get upgraded to a bigger room, but its not cheap!"
250,662,"Aug 6 2006	Great location shame about the Room	I booked the London Corus Hyde Park hotel as a suprise for my wife for our first wedding anniversary. The hotel is in a really good location about 10 min walk from the tube right by Hyde Park. We walked into the hotel and found the staff very helpful and the reception was well decorated and bright and airy.We got to our room and this was when the hotel lost its charm. The Room was so small, it had a double bed where you could only walk down one side, a small table and a very small bathroom. It was also very hot. It had a fan on the ceiling which when you turned it on made such a loud noise that we thought it was going to fall off the ceiling. When we opened the window the noise from the road outside was loud so we had to keep the window closed. The hotel did give us a replacement fan for the noisy one but it was so stuffy it made sleeping really difficult.The breaksfast was good and the staff were all very nice. The room although very small was clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is a good location but if you are looking for a nice space to relax in, then you can find much better hotels for the same money."
251,662,"Aug 3 2006	Not beautiful not big but absolutely fine. Book it!	Quick, first, the negatives: our room was quite small, though I wasn't bothered (I've happily stayed in smaller, in London and other European capitals), the decor is bizarre and although fascinating (Who decided to make a feature of the trouser press? Why is the bathroom light switch an elevator call button?), not especially attractive, and there is no mini-bar. The standard rooms are not air-conditioned, although there is a fan. The tv is small and distant from the bed. That said, I had a very comfortable stay in what I would call a 'three and a half star' business hotel. The location is great, close to the centre but in a nice area. Even with the nearest tube station, Lancaster Gate, closed for refurbishment, it's only 5 minutes walk to Queensway, or 10 min to Paddington. If you don't fancy the tube, the Oxford st shops are about a half hour walk (through posh residential streets) and a cab home after an evening in Soho is 10 pounds. Hyde Park is just across the road. The bathroom was small but spotless and shiny and had a fine shower (and, under certain configurations of switches, a perplexing green light). The hair dryer was powerful and had many settings. There were many pillows, the bed was excellent (but not broad) and for those who need to work, there was a decent-sized desk. The hotel bar was open late (at least until 1:30am, in a town where many pubs still shut at 11pm) and reasonably priced. We didn't try the breakfast but instead walked around the corner to a cafe that did nice cooked breakfasts for 4 or 5 pounds. Booking at the last minute we got a double room for 80 GBP a night (without breakfast) which was outstanding value for London. The alleged full rate is nearly twice that; I don't think that would be outstanding value but I doubt anyone actually pays that."
252,662,"Jul 31 2006 	Lovely	Woking, SurreyWe booked this hotel because of its triple room facility, location, price and availability. On arrival it was visually lovely too. Lovely Edwardian white building with masses of flowers on each windowsill and around the entrance. Its location is super, just across the road from Hyde Park by the Italian Fountains, more or less next door to the Hyde Park Superstore (a very small extremelly convenient little shop which sells everything) and very close to the underground station. We were only staying for one night, we had a room at the back which was very quiet and was totally acceptable for our short stay and we fully appreciated the air-conditioning which was lovely during the very hot weather. The size of the room was fine, no problem but the little things that usually count were lacking, such as the bathrom bits and pieces, all of which didn't really matter, but I do like and need a shower cap. The reception staff were very friendly and I await the arrival of a little jacket that I unfortunaely left in the room. They acknowledge they had it and said they would post it to me today. How kind. I must admit we found the cafe area and the breakfast area a little too cafeteria like, but the full english breakfast was fine."
253,662,"Jul 27 2006 	Clean lovely wonderful location and inexpensive.	I stayed two nights here on a stopover through London and was very impressed. I had a single, and though the room was small it was IMMACULATE and very nicely fitted out with surprisingly stylish design. For this price, you would expect to get a grotty B&amp;B or be much further out of Central London, and yet this hotel was central, clean, and stylish. The breakfast was fine, and following it up with a walk in Hyde Park across the road each morning was a rare delight. All of the staff was helpful and pleasant, and the transport links are good for tube, rail, and bus. I will most definitely stay here again and would encourage anyone else to as well."
254,662,"Jul 8 2006	Great location	We stayed at the Corus Hyde Park from June 24-July 1, 2006. I can't think of a better location, it is on the north side of Hyde Park and about 1/2 way between Marble Arch and Kensington Palace.Our room was extremely clean, tastefully decorated though small. Air conditioning is not in most rooms which was disappointing as we were under the understanding that the hotel was airconditioned. The lobby is air conditioned as are Executive Rooms. There is no storage in the room for clothes so clothing stayed in the suitcase. You may want to ask for a room away from Bayswater Street as the traffic is loud throughout the day and night.The lobby/reception seem to have been redone and are quite nice.Continental breakfast was ok.Close to restaurants just down the side street.I'd stay again but I'd ensure that I request an air conditioned room and away from the street."
255,662,"Jul 7 2006	Don't waste your pennies! Very dissappointing	My husband and I booked in for three nights at the beginning of July, during a very hot period in London. The hotel claims to be a four star and is no more than a very shabby three star tourist hotel. Who refurbished this hotel? Clearly someone with a fascination for the early eighties and for man made fibres and blue gingham.The Executive Double room, whilst a decent large size, has no more than a small double bed (nothing like the normal Kingsize you would expect in other hotels), the sheets are cheap and rough and have seen better days. The television is a tiny old box at the top of a shelf in the corner of the room. We were told that as we were in an Executive room, we were fortunate to have air-conditioning. What a laugh! It didn't work and faintly generated a tiny breeze of tepid air so the room was unbearably hot. The paltry toiletries in the bathroom consisted of squeezable bottle of detergent style handsoap and liquid soap in the shower (no shampoo, no soap bar, no shower cap, no moisturiser, no face washers, and definitely nothing like a sewing or vanity kit etc).The refurbishment consisted of very cheap office style furniture (alright if you have an itchy back, but otherwise very uncomfortable). There is no minibar in the room (a four star hotel with no mini bar? even many three star hotels have them!) There are no glasses if you bring your own drinks - just a couple of plastic cups in the bathroom.The room service breakfast is a 'take it or leave it' approach. You can choose between watery tea or coffee and it comes with small boxes of cornflakes and stale bread rolls/croissant. If you want sugar with your tea or coffee at breakfast, make sure you ask for it as it doesn't come automatically!! On the second day, the breakfast was delivered at 6.35am instead of at the ordered time of 7.15-7.30. On redelivery, it was late - more like 7.45.Clearly, there is also a problem with the level of English comprehension with the staff and an appaling lack of service attitude. Beware - Lancaster Gate tube station is closed for refurbishment, so the closest operating tube station is Paddington station, which is not on the Central Line, so if you stay here purely for location, check beforehand.What a dire hotel - I really feel that there is a bit of false advertising. For goodness sake - stay at the Royal Park, it's not that much more expensive and at least they make an effort! There is no minibar there either, but you get free drinks and the rooms are quality!"
256,662,"Jun 22 2006	great stay	once i had booked this hotel i stumbled upon some rather negative comments about the rooms and the staff at the corus, and needless to say i was a little apprehensive.  I shouldn't have worried!! The staff were excellent, very polite and helpful, the concierge, Benno, was a great guy who just loved to help. The rooms, yes, a little on the small side, but it was clean, and quiet. And come on, you're in London for gods sake, why would you bee overly concerned with how big your room was, its a place to lay your head before another busy day shopping, sightseeing or drinking!! All in all i loved this hotel and will definitely be staying there again!!! Beware though, in july Lancaster gate is shutting, temporarily, best to check where nearest tube station is, other than this one for that time, might not be too far, just a point to note."
257,662,Jun 15 2006 	Ok for the price	I stayed here for one night on business and whilst I was hardly bowled over by this hotel it was better than some I have recently stayed in. The rooms were VERY VERY small and unbearably hot (there was no air conditioning available) but clean and well looked after. Unfortunately as it was so hot in the room I had to sleep with the window open which meant that I was awaken very early in the morning by the sound of traffic rushing past the window (the hotel is located on a busy road opposite Hyde Park and having the window open was unavoidable) I shouldnt imagine this is a problem in the winter but I will certainly be avoiding this hotel again in the summer!!!The bathroom was small but modern (even more so than in the bedrooms) and would have been too small for two people sharing a room.Service at check-in and during breakfast was friendly and the staff in the breakfast room were very attentive and friendly. Breakfast also seemed very fresh and plentiful.Lancaster Gate tube station is a stones throw from the hotel and is located on the Central line so its very easy to get almost anywhere within a short space of time.I would only stay at this hotel again if I had a limited budget but it will not be my first choice.
258,662,"Jun 13 2006	Beautiful	We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel is located across from Hyde Park, a few blocks from the Underground Lancaster Gate Terminal. Our room was very tiny, and had a comfortable queen bed, in-room safe, and a very nice bathroom. The decor was modern, and appealing. Cleaning staff was very friendly and efficient. Our towels and complimentary soaps were stocked daily.The continental breakfast consisted of cereals, croissants, fresh fruit, tea, coffee, milk and juice. The staff were very attentive and courteous.We would definately stay here again! We loved the cleanliness and the upgraded amenities in the rooms, as well as the friendliness of the staff."
259,662,"Jun 10 2006	A great stay	We only had 1 night at Corus hotel on a 2 day stopover in London. We found the location great, close to Lancaster Gate station and bus stops. One of the tourist busses stops just around the corner too so this was perfect for us sight seeing. From the minute we walked in the door we felt welcome and the friendly staff couldn't have been more helpful. The staff told us where to get the tourist bus, where to catch the bus to Notting Hill(and how much to expect to pay), Sightseeing things not to miss out on. We arived early (9am) so our room wasn't ready so we were happy to leave our bags and go sight seeing. We were upgraded for our troubles and the room was lovely. Modern, clean and a good size. We did find the breakfast the next morning a little dissapointing, I had a killer hang over and needed a coffee but there were no clean cups available, so I asked and was told they wouldn't be long but they only brought out a few at a time so everyone rushed in and I missed out the first 3 lots. They didn't seem to have much of anything and there was still guests arriving for their breakfast.The hotel was happy to hold our bags till 7pm so we could make the most off our time in London.We would definately stay here if we were to visit London again."
260,662,"May 16 2006	Great Location	We arrived well before check in time, but were pleased to hear that our room was ready. The weather was brilliant, but due to the lack of air conditioning in standard rooms, meant that the room was very stuffy. There was a fan and we did open the window, which helped, but I'm sure the heat would have been too much for some, I did see notices in reception welcoming you to upgrade your room to superior with air conditioning for an extra 30 a night, I think if we'd been staying any longer than two nights we might have had to.The room was clean, bathroom was on the small size but more than made up for with the brilliant shower. The room was a decent size but the bed was pushed into the corner, maybe not so good if you don't like (like me!) being up against the wall to sleep.The reception and bar area are lovelly, and the staff friendly and helpful.The location in brilliant, 2 minutes from Lancaster Gate tube station, and right across the road from Hyde Park, well worth a wander round, especially in the brilliant weather we had.In all, a great little hotel, especially when you can get a good deal on Lastminute.com like we did. But if I was to stay for longer than a couple of nights I would definetely have to upgrade rooms."
261,662,"May 15 2006	Very Nice! I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.	May, 2006Four of us have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Corus Hotel on Hyde Park, London. We were all very pleased with the staff, the rooms, and the breakfast (which was included in the price for the room). The rooms were clean, more spacious then what we expected, and the service was very good. The staff was accomodating and pleasant at all times. During our stay we had many questions for the Concierge staff, all of whom were very helpful and patient. We reserved two rooms, each for 99 British Pounds per night, including a full English breakfast. Breakfast was served on the bottom floor, in a sunny and very clean room, and breakfast was buffet style. We had cold cereals, a few juices, fruit, sausages, bacon, eggs (both scrambled and fried), fried tomatoes, and sliced fried potatoes from which to choose. Once we were seated, the wait staff was immediately at our side to question our preference for coffee or tea and toast. Prior to our visit, I contacted the hotel about my concern for the size of the rooms, due to the height of the men in our party. The person who spoke to me was pleasant, understanding and typed a note into the computer while we were speaking; the rooms we were given accomodated the height of the men. The window opened part way - enough to receive the cool breeze of May and the air conditioning, although not powerful, did help on a couple of nights. There is a small restaurant in the hotel, as well as a bar area where we could order food late in the evening. We have no complaints about this hotel, and if ever in London again, we would certainly go back."
262,662,May 15 2006	Fabulous!!!	We stayed in this hotel for our wedding anniversary. The location was wonderful. we enjoyed having our coffees by just looking at the Excellent Hyde Park.The room service was very good and the hotel staff was very helpful.Room was very clean and big enough for a short stay.We really enjoyed the next door pub! Swan.The Lancaster Gate tube is only two minutes walking distance from the hotel.The area was very secure and very close to the heart of London.We enjoyed every bit of our stay in Corus Hotel!:)
263,662,"May 1 2006	Can't beat the location	Stayed at the Corus for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience. It was the perfect place to stay. Arrived a little early and while a room was available, we chose to wait for a non-smoking room. Checked our bags and went out to explore for an hour. The hotel is a block away from the Lancaster Gate station on the Central Line and is directly across from the beautiful Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. Paddington Station is also a short distance away. The room we got was great. I'd read about the tiny rooms, but that was not our experience. It was good size room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was much larger than most Manhattan apartments! Overall it was inviting enough to relax after a long day of sightseeing. Service was great. While there was a pant press in the room I requested an iron and board and received it five minutes later. Used room service a couple of times and each time satisfied with my selection. The concierge was helpful with getting stamps for postcards and advice on where to eat around the area. The hustle and bustle of paddington is not really in plain sight so what looks like a predominantly residential areas really isn't. I thought that was a plus, because the room was quiet, no real traffic or people noise."
264,662,"Apr 20 2006	Great Base for exploring London	The hotel room was smaller than we had anticipated. We were only staying for a weekend, but if we had been there for longer I think we would have had trouble storing our luggage. There was a wardrobe in the room with about 6 coat hangers and also a trouser press. The room had a modern design and the bed although quite small, was really comfortable. The bathroom was also quite small and the towels were very thin.The room was cleaned every day, and the bed was changed and also we recieved clean towels. Location wise, this hotel is brilliant, it is right near Lancaster Tube Station, it has Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens across the road, and if you feel like a walk you can take a stroll through the park to Knightsbridge. We paid 69 for the night and if we were to get this sort of rate again we would definitely visit again.The reception staff and concierge were also helpful and allowed us to leave our bags with them once we had checked out so we had some more time during the day to do some exploring!!"
265,662,"Apr 11 2006	Would recommend!	Nice hotel. Stayed there for a couple of nights. The reception and concierge were very helpful. They allowed us to check in hours early. The room was indeed small but very manageable, comfortable and very clean. The room was hot and dry but you can crack open the window for air. It also had a safe box which is nice. Lobby is clean and nice place to hang out. We didn't have their breakfast so I can't comment on that.Great location. Across the street is Hyde Park. I went jogging every morning I was there. The Lancaster Gate station is about a minute walk and the bus stops the same.I would definitely come back again given the amenities, location and price."
266,662,"Apr 2 2006	Liked the green light in the bathroom!	Had a great stay in the Corus. Weren't able to check in early but we were able to leave our bags at the concierge, which was helpful.The room was small but it wasn't a problem. Room was modern and very clean and the shower was nice. Loved the the green spotlight in the bathroom!The lobby area/bar was nice too - very relaxed.Would certainly stay here again."
267,662,"Apr 1 2006 	Decent hotel	I stayed for two nights at the end of March whilst on a business trip. The hotel is well located within 2 minutres walk of Lancaster Gate Tube (Central Line) and only 600yds from Paddington. Some rooms overlook Hyde Park which is a perfect place for an afternoon stroll or early morning jog.My room wasn't massive but then how much time do you spend in a hotel room? The bathroom was small but it had a decent shower in it. Check in was smooth, the staff polite and the concierge service was very helpful. The breakfast was very good with an excellent selection of full cooked English, cereals, fruits, yoghurts etc.All in all it was a pleasant stay and I would consider staying there again."
268,662,Mar 31 2006 	Small but value for money	Stayed here after business function to avoid late train travel to Hertfordshire.As mentioned frequently before rooms are small (and very hot) but clean and functional for short stay. For 2 people I recommend booking Twin room as you will have 2 beds which makes more sense in small room like this.Staff were friendly and location convenient for Oxford Street. Would use it again because of value for money in London.
269,662,"Mar 27 2006	short break	Stayed with my husband for 2 nights (23-25 march). Yes the rooms are small but adequate for a short stay. Problem with the safe in the room but this was rectified as soon as possible and an alternate safe was provided with the conseiage at reception. Tea and coffee (excellent selection) was supplied in the room, and replenished daily. Our booking included Full English Breakfast, excellent choice of both cooked and continental. A note had been left in our room on the Friday to warn us that breakfast on Saturday was expected to be busy. We had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table. The Location is good 2 minutes from Tube station giving you instant access to LOndon all its attractions and across the road is hyde park. We would use this hotel again."
270,662,"Mar 24 2006	Sure it's small but...	...but it's nice, it's clean, and the staff is very friendly. The concierge was very helpful and gave us some great recommendations. It's a bit out of the way, but the Lancaster Gate tube stop is less than a block away, so you can easily get most anywhere. My recommendation is to worry less about the size of the room and get out and see the city!"
271,662,"Mar 22 2006 	disinterested staff uninspired digs	this hotel has a lot of problems. it's not dirty but it has the smallest of rooms and worst of all, staff who are clueless lack any sort of interest in their guests...i was seated at a table for one in the restaurant and waited for fifteen minutes for my order to be taken. after i ordered, another fifteen minutes before a young waitress told me they couldnt serve me as there was a large backup in the kitchen. i could come back in two hours (it was 8:30 PM) or go somewhere else.book here before you sleep under the bridge but don't expect anything.the overall ambiance is of that of a cheapo airline lounge..."
272,662,"Mar 20 2006	One room per half person	I cannot emphasize how small the rooms actually are, you would think that for the price of the room and the location of the hotel you would sacrifice the room size, but when you step in you realize how big of a mistake you've done when you booked your stay in this hotel. Yes, they say all hotel rooms in London are pretty small but this hotel really took it to the next level.The bed (Full) is attached to the wall and you are left with about a 1.5 on the side of the bed to hang out, if youre traveling with a spouse be prepared to fall off the bed at some point during your sleep.Dont even think of turning the TV on, since the size is so small and is placed so far above that you have to squint to make out the faces on the TV set. The channels available are numbered from 1-5. Well, you wont even want to hang out in the room so forget the TV.The continental breakfast served is basically croissants and cereal, so make sure if that what you have to bring some extra milk or just go somewhere else to eat.All in all this hotel room was free when I booked my airline ticket so I cant really complain, but all Im doing is stating the facts i went through when I stayed at this hotel."
273,662,"Mar 14 2006	Excellent weekend	We have just returned from an excellent weekend in London staying at the Corus Hyde Park Hotel. We arrived in the morning and we were allocated our room straight away, quite spacious, immaculate and spotlessly clean. The food in the restaurant was very good and the breakfast was excellent. From our experience we would recommend this Hotel because of the friendliness of the staff throughout the Hotel , the food and the rooms. All in all a very enjoyable stay. Looking forward to returning later in the year."
274,662,"Mar 12 2006	central location	Stayed here March 10-12th 2006. Hotel very central, next to Lancaster gate tube station,and opposite Hyde Park. Nice decor, rooms clean, but small with limited storage. Staff very helpful and pleasant. Nice breakfast buffet.Good for a short break."
275,662,"Mar 3 2006 	Fab Hotel Very Compact tho!	Very nice Hotel! I enjoyed my stay very much, the staff were very helpfull. The rooms are small but have everything u need (kettle, hairdrier, iron). They are very nicley decorated and comfortable. I had english breakfast and it was delicious staff were friendly and welcoming. The only problem I had was the room was so hot and I couldnt turn down the heating but im sure if I had mentioned this it would have been sorted. Very central plenty of shops and resturants."
276,662,"Mar 3 2006	Very weird rooms?	Just before christmas i took my girlfiend to london for a bit of shopping, we stayed in this hotel only for 1 night, its an alright location.The decor inside is abit cheapy looking for a 4* hotel, we checked in to find out we were sleeping in a rabbit hutch!. and the room is a very weird decor abit chinese?, ive never ever stayed in a smaller room!, hardly any light! the toilet was like something out of Dr Who! with a weird green light.I suppose its ok for you money, but wouldnt stay there again.I didnt think the staff were very helpful, ok i might be 18yrs old but they looked at me as if i wasnt too be in the hotel!."
277,662,"Feb 21 2006	As I thought it would be....	My sister and her family met me at the hotel where we stayed one night. My sister had already warned me about how small the rooms would be so I was ready for a smaller room than what I received. My sister's room was about the size that I thought it would be, which was fine for one night. My room was perfect for one person, yes it is small but very clean and when I go back to London I will try my hardest to stay here again. The view of Hyde Park and the hotel is very close to a tube station makes up for the fact that it has small rooms. In my own opinion I had a great stay and will go back."
278,662,Feb 19 2006	Good Value Clean yet compact	I took myself and my daughter to London for a few days and I spend quite a lot of time reviewing the hotels and I am quite fussy.Booked through Superbreaks and 2 nights cost 118.00 - not many hotels offer 1/2 price for kids!! The room was very small but it was well equipped and clean.Breakfast was great and would stay again at this rate.
279,662,"Feb 19 2006	Very lovely hotel...	I stayed at the Corus on special offer for a weekend last April. I liked the location- quaint, mellow and after just leaving a hotel in Piccadily it was a welcome change. However, when I checked into the hotel (where I booked a single) I was told that the room was smaller than most thought and that I should consider upgrading. The receptionist was right!! I have never been in a cruise cabin that was as small as that single!! Insanely tiny, almost unable to move around in! But I returned to reception and I was given a complimentary upgrade which I was extremely grateful for. The rooms are well decorated and nicely furnished and the proximity to the Tube station was extremely useful. However, there isn't much going on at night and you have to walk a fair bit to get to the more active section of town. Hyde Park is across the street but for the standard price (not on special offer), I don't think this hotel is worth it!"
280,662,"Feb 12 2006	Like being in a dolls house!	My husband and I stayed here for one night in Feb 06, and we were amazed at the size of this room! The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen!The room was clean and tidy, but absolutely NO storage for clothes ect. The windows really need to be double glazed as it is incredibly noisy all night long with sirens and cars speeding past even though we were on the 7th floor we were kept awake most of the night.The tv was tiny so if lazing on your bed you couldn't see the screen clearly.The Full English Breakfast is very good though!But best to get to it early to avoid the long queues.Would I stay at this hotel again? Definatley not, I would only rate this as 2 star and not real value for money."
281,662,"Feb 5 2006 	Great London Hotel	Located less than a five minute walk from Oxford Street and overlooking Hyde Park, the Corus Hotel is a modern hotel within an old style building.Freshly decorated with bright colours, the hotels interior was clean and attractive. Sure, the bathroom wasn't the biggest, but the rest of the room was well laid out and comfortable.A good selection for full English breakfast in the morning and staff who were friendly and helpful.Just the one negative - no parking on site and only residents parking in the surrounding area. Nearest public car park was a five minute walk.That said, we would definitely stay here again, car or no car!"
282,662,"Jan 28 2006 	Clean hotel with great staff	Stayed at the Corus for 2 nights on business and was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews.Yes, the rooms are compact but have everything you could need - right down to a mini ironing board and iron and an in room safe.The rooms are cleanly decorated with excellent lighting and are amongst some of the best maintained I have ever seen in the capital. The bathroom, though very small, was immaculate and the shower fantastic.Not sure why people complain about the heat - I just adjusted the theromstat on the radiator - hardly rocket science!Ate dinner in the restaurant one evening and it was great for the money and served by very friendly staff in a professional manner. The breakfast room is also very pleasantly decorated, clean and well maintained.Staff throughout this hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful, something you don't always find in much more expensive properties.My only complaint would be about some other guests making too much noise - a TV doens't need to be on high volume at 3am! Overall a great hotel, good value and with well trained staff. Would I recommend it? Well I was already booked in for next week before my first stay and I certainly wouldn't think of changing my reservation to another hotel following this first experience."
283,662,"Jan 26 2006	Excellent Hotel	My partner and I stayed at this hotel after hours of research on the net for a reasonably priced London hotel. This one definitely exceeded our expectations. It is VERY close to Lancaster Gate tube station, the staff were both knowledgable and helpful, and our room was immaculate and of a very decent size (Room 730), compared to what we were led to believe from reading previous reviews. The only thing we regret is that we didn't book our entire London stay in this hotel.....ah well, we'll know for next time!!!!!"
284,662,"Jan 18 2006	Agreed with the ""midget"" review	Smallest toilet ever experienced, only mildly larger than an airplane toilet! No wardrobe, so life is lived out of luggage. Rooms were tropical, no expense spared on heating. Clean, staff pleasant, good area, right beside Tube Station (Lancaster Gate), though not cheap."
285,662,"Jan 9 2006	Great Hotel in a Great Location	I stayed for five days the week before Christmas at the Corus Hyde Park. The rooms, albeit very small, were very clean and had good amenities. The room rate included a full English Breakfast Buffet in a clean, well-lighted dining room. The service in both the dining room and the hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. The best part of the hotel is its location. It is located directly across the street from the Lancaster Gate of Hyde Park. You can stroll past the Italian Fountains or walk to Kensington Palace. I jogged every morning in Hyde Park and actually saw a red fox in the park. The hotel is one block from the Lancaster Gate Tube Station on the Central Line of the Underground. The hotel is also conveniently located along several major bus lines that can take you to all the major locations in central London. The hotel is situated in a quiet neighborhood and there are shops, a nice pub and a launder mat all within a short walk. I highly recommend the hotel for its cleanliness and courteous staff."
286,662,"Jan 3 2006	Great Hotel	After reading some reviews prior to staying in this hotel we was slightly concerned. We arrived at 10am and checked in, knowing this was a little early, We were advised by a helpful member of staff that a room was ready and we had been upgraded to an executive suite, which was a large room, with lovely large bath and lovely view, so we had no trouble with small rooms etcc.. room service was excellent arrived within about 15 mins and full english buffet breakfast downstairs in restaurant was spot on.Would recommend this hotel, but then again, we did have a larger room, and should we have stayed in one of smaller rooms our opinon may be slightly different."
287,662,"Dec 3 2005	Very Good Value	Corus Hotel, November 28, 2005. Very Good.Very good value for money. Although the room was small, it was well designed, very clean and comfortable. Position is excellent, is 1 minute from the tube station, opposite Hyde Park, and near all the attractions. I will definitely stay here again."
288,662,"Nov 29 2005 	One of the better London hotels in the price range	I've recently moved to London for work and have been booking hotels on lastminute until I find a flat. Of the several hotels I've been in I prefer the Corus so far. The room is clean, the decor is fairly modern (compared to other places in this area), the lobby is pleasant, and the staff were very friendly. The location is great (right across from Hyde Park). I will caution the average reader that I can sleep through more noise than most people so my comments on noise should be discounted. However, at least from my room (on the 8th floor), noise wasn't a significant problem. I am writing all this based on the good price I got on lastminute[-]. If I had to pay normal rates maybe I would have a different view. Yes, the bathroom was small but I think some reviewers should have some cultural sensitivity. Do you want a strip mall Motel 6 with big bathrooms or do you want beautiful architecture in Central London? One has to make some sacrifices I guess. I personally don't really care so much about the size of the bathroom given that I would rather be sightseeing. Again, do you care more about cool pubs, bars, restaurants, people on the street, aesthetics of a city, parks museums, or large bathrooms. Anyways, I have had a good time here so far. Knock on wood as I'm still here!..."
289,662,"Nov 21 2005 	great for midgets	I stayed at this hotel 14 November for 2 nights. Lucky there was only me in the room - it had a double bed and with two people in the room it would have been intolerable; I could touch two walls with arms outstreched. Yes it's clean; yes, its centrally located - but you've now said it all. The walls are so thin that you can hear everything going on in the rooms either side - I mean everything! I was on business and had jet lag as well, so being woken at 2.30 was not my idea of heaven, epecially when the noise went on for an hour and no-one did anything about it. Breakfast is a basic continental in a small dining room. They give free room service to try and keep the wait down for breakfast, trouble is room service doesn't work either. Day 1 my breakfast had not arrived after 30 minutes, so ring room service; after 5 minutes constant ringing I gave up and went down for breakfast. Many colleagues had the same problem. If you want a relatively cheap, warm, clean shoebox to hole up in whilst in London then this may be for you. If you want sonmewhere you can actually sleep and a semblance of space - oh, and a drawer to put your smalls in - then try somwhere else."
290,662,"Nov 10 2005	Incredibly small room	The Corus was exactly what we expected, an older building with small rooms.......but we were surprised at how small. The worst part however is that there is no dresser, no chest of drawers or armoire for clothing. There was a cubbyhole next to a bar for hanging......that was it for 1 week! Very tight and cramped. Clean though. And the bathtub is so high...if you have the slightest problem with your legs or knees find another hotel. The location is convenient, a 1 min. walk to the tube. The staff were accommodating, in fact it was a very warm day when we arrived and when I inquired about air conditioning I was told the rooms were not air conditioned.....however since we were staying 6 nights they gave us a free upgrade to one of the few with a/c. There is a very nice pub across from Kensington Gardens called the Black Lion which was much nicer that the Swan Pub.....the Toad In The Hole was delish. Breakfast was good......cheeses, ham, cereals, croissant, rolls, fruit, jam etc. and it starts early, 6 am, so you can get an early start to your day. Overall I have nothing terrible to say about the Corus or London.......we had a great time. But I doubt I'll return."
291,662,Oct 31 2005	Very pleasant hotel	Very nice hotel in a convenient location. Rooms lovely and clean. Rooms were quite hot and stuffy though and we requested a fan which arrived within one minute! All in all a good hotel which we will probably return to in the New Year.
292,662,"Oct 26 2005	Good location but be careful with your bill.... Check Check Check	The hotel is located in a nice area, very close to Lancastergate tube station, so it is very convenient. The continental breakfast is great! The room is SO small, but clean. The hotel pictures describe exactly what you will find there.Everything was fine until I receive the telephone bill. The amount was incredible unacceptable, so I wanted to speak with the manager since they did not give me the rate's list. They made me speak with the hotel concierge who was very rude. I had to pretend that I wanted to call again, but would like to check the rates before placing the call, since I already had exceeded my budget. By magic the list arrived, and I could check that they were charging me 2 times more than it was in the list. They were charging 3 pounds for a local call!!!! At the end, they gave me 50% discount... meaning that it went back to the correct price (still VERY EXPENSIVE). They told me that I should have bought a calling card, since hotels calls are really expensive, and this is how they make money. I could not believe that I was listening that argument.I will never stay there again, regardless the good location, since vacation is not only location, but whole pleasure package, and I had to stress a lot at the end of my stay."
293,662,"Oct 12 2005	Good hotel	This is a functional hotel. It clientele contains a great number of tourists. The location is nicely situated across from Hyde Park. Rooms were clean. However, the quarters could have used a few touch-ups on the paint job. Overall, it is useful place to stay for a good rate during the middle of the business week. On the weekend, you can find better deals at more upscale business hotels.The common areas are sort of decorated in bright Ikea chic, which doesn't always appeal to me when consuming my evening cocktail. But, there are plenty of nearby pubs you can enjoy."
294,662,"Sep 12 2005	I Would Stay There Again	My family and I had two rooms in this hotel as part of a British Airways package. Our daughters' (adults) room had been refurbished and was nicer than ours, but ours was acceptable. Breakfast was quite good with a very nice selection of rolls, croissants, cheese, ham, jams and juices.The location was wonderful. The Lancaster Gate tube station is witin a two-minute walk. We did stay an extra night beyond what was included in the package and my impression was that it was a reasonable value compared to what I knew about other prices in London. The area around the hotel offered a lot of local charm and was quite close to Paddington Station -- we took a taxi when we first arrived but could have walked in about 5-10 minutes."
295,662,"Sep 7 2005	Hot Hot Hot!	The location of this hotel is excellent and it is immaculately clean. The rooms, however, are incredibly small, even for London! We were there on the hottest day of the year and the temperature inside the room and the corridors was unbearable, there is no air conditioning and we didn't have a fan. We were forced to open the window overnight which meant we were woken by trucks arriving at 6am, having been disturbed constantly by a generator noise! At 8am, the maid let herself in (we were too sleepy to hear the door!) so the next morning we hung a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and were woken again by the maid knocking to ask when we would be leaving! Although the prices were reasonable and I loved the area, I wouldn't stay here again."
296,662,"Jul 3 2005	Good Hotel small room	Just got back from the Corus Hyde Park, where we stayed for the Live8 weekend (Fri-Sun). First impressions- nice building, clean, modern. The reception staff are pleasant and courteous and check-in was swift and smooth. We had to pay a 40.00 deposit (20.00 per night) for any extras which we may have taken during our stay, such as the movies, playstation, room service, telephone calls etc.I was quite taken aback at the size of our double room, as it didn't look the same size as the webphotos. It was wide enough to take the double bed, which was against the wall to one side, and there was about 2 foot of walk space on the other side! The room was quite long though to be fair. The room was immaculately clean and you could tell that it has been recently redecorated. The bathrooom was average size and could accommodate 1 person at a time. We had both bath and shower, which was great. The only really negative issue was the overwhelming heat in the room! The sash window could open about 6 inches and there was a fan attached to the wall near the ceiling, but it didn't do much good. I couldn't close the bathroom door because the heat was suffocating in there when the door was shut. I would strongly recommend an upgrade to an air conditioned room (which we will do if we visit again) if you can't stand your accommodation being too hot. The weather outside wasn't particularly hot this weekend, so I dread to think what it would be like in a heatwave!We booked and paid for continental breakfast (as this was the only option left available for the dates we wanted), but when we arrived in our room we were given the option to upgrade to a full English breakfast for a supplement of only 3.50 pppn, which was fantastic. All you need to do is tell them that you want to upgrade when you go down to breakfast in the morning and have it charged to your room, which is very convenient. The breakfast was piping hot and absolutely delicious with a good variety. We were offered tea/coffee and toast. By the time we collected our breakfast, which is self service, and returned to our table, the coffee and toast was there waiting. If you wanted, you could also have the continental option as well, but we found that the full breakfast was more than sufficient. We are hoping to return to London again this summer and would be happy to stay at the Corus. p.s we scoured the internet for hotels and found the best deal at (---)"
297,662,"Jun 8 2005	Glad we chose this hotel	Great location. Rooms small but well-designed so very comfortable. Immaculately clean. Large continental breakfast. Breakfast room has lots of windows overlooking Hyde Park. Just under two blocks to the tube which we found very convenient. (The tube station required walking some stairs - which may be a problem for some people carrying baggage.) Our family had two rooms - one with air conditioning and one only with a fan. The highs during the day were about 68 degrees Fahrenheit. With those highs, the fan kept the small room cool and the air conditioning just kept the other room comfortable. I don't know how comfortable the rooms would be in hot weather. Staff was pleasant. The shower is in a very deep bath tub so it's a big step to get out of it - this might be a problem for some people. We were very glad we stayed at this hotel and would recommend it."
298,662,"Jun 6 2005	Good Value Great Location	I've just returned from a long weekend at the Corus hotel, Hyde Park. Overall I enjoyed my stay - the hotel is in a great location. It overlooks Hyde Park and is minutes from Lancaster Gate Tube making it an ideal location for those wanting something just out of the main bussle. I occupied a single room. It was clean, well presented and ideal for me. My only complain about the room was the heat. There was no air conditioning, the window would not open and only a wall fan provided any air circulation. Given that the weather was very muggy during the weekend, it made it very difficult to sleep in comfort.The only other problem I encountered was with the lifts. Of the three available, only one was available onne morning and it took almost 20 mins to actually get down to reception (No one seemed to be able to locate any stairs).Overall these were not major issues and id happily stay at this hotel again"
299,662,"May 25 2005	the smallest rooms in London	I have trouble even giving a 2 star review of this property but it is right along Kensington Park. I'm 5'3&quot; and could lay across the width of the room and touch both ends! Does this give you an idea of how narrow the rooms are? I had to sleep with my suitcase in my bed since there was no room to put it on the available floor space. The wardrobe was so shallow that you had to put your clothes in flat, facing forward and with a capacity for about 3 shirts. The bathrooms are okay. My friend's room was bizarre. The entrance from the hallway was into the hotel room's bathroom. So, you had to go through the bathroom to get to the bed area. The breakfast was okay. No A/C is a very bad thing even in winter since the radiator runs continously. Windows were painted shut. A lot of Cosmos tours stay here. Also, it is a known pick-pocket area."
300,662,"May 23 2005	Tiny Needs Updating But Convenient	We booked a vacation through British Airways that included 2 free nights in a London Hotel - we selected the Corus. In our first room, the bed must have been 50 years old. It was the worst bed, the room was falling apart with old wall paper falling down. We were on the first floor and could not open the windows and there was no A/C. It was not hot in London, but was extremely noisy and stuffy. We did change rooms the next day and the staff did not give us much hassle. The second room was the smallest we have ever seen - small for European standards or NYC. The bed was against the wall and there was barely room to walk by and that was the entire room. But, it was an improvement because we could actually sleep on the bed and could open the window. The hotel is extremely convenient - one block from the underground subway and near Paddington Station. And the rooms were relatively clean. Overall, unless the room was free through British Airways, we would not go back."
301,662,"May 17 2005	very average	Very average hotel - rooms are tiny (even for London). Our room was skinny and long, we felt like we were in a pencil box with no closet and no view at all (room was overlooking the back of the building where kitchen trucks were arriving). Also it was getting pretty hot at night, so we had to open window a little bit, but then we could hear trucks early in the morning. Bathroom was really tiny as well. Building is very pretty from outside. Our continental breakfast was quite decent - few types of cereal, 2 types of juices, milk, tea, coffee, 2 or 3 types of rolls, jams, cheese, ham... Staff was pretty friendly.We didn't like location a lot - it was o'k, very close to the park and the tube, but nothing else. We liked Tavistock much better (and hotel itself and location). We won't be staying at this hotel again."
302,662,"May 7 2005	Good hotel for London - bad attitude from staff	This was my second stay at the Corus. Found the hotel to be well located and good value for London. This time however, I encountered a problem upon check-in. The rate I had selected on the Internet was for bed and full English breakfast but the hotel records showed room only. When I questioned this, the condescending French receptionsit indicated that I was getting a very good rate and proceeded to show me what rack rates were for the hotel (who pays rack rates?). Further that he had been a receptionist for many years and HE knows what hotels should cost(who is interested in his career experiences?) I insisted that I should have breakfast included whereupon they reluctantly agreed, but the next morning I found that it was only continental breakfast being offered. Finally, I had to log on to their website to prove that the rate I selected included full English breakfast. (cost me one pound 50 to log on and get a page printed. )Meanwhile in their rooms, the rates I had been quoted are clearly stated in their hotel info. brochure! It would be good therefore if the desk staff were aware of what was on their website and also what info. is in their rooms. But more importantly they should gain an understanding of the word 'hospitality' and make sure that any individuals with 'attitude' are not put in front of customers. Other than this incident, I would probably stay here again because of the good location and in spite of the microscopic rooms"
303,662,"Apr 26 2005	Great value	We stayed at this hotel for free thanks to a BA package. We concur with most comments on here: the room was small (there was room for a double bed, and a desk, and that was it (literally); the room was clean; decorations were spartan but nice; and the staff was friendly. The best part is definetely the location; hyde park is a beautiful place to spend the day and the metro is very close. My only caution?: It was only the end of March and the halls were sweltering; our room was cool because we could open the window, but I imagine it would be awful in the summer since there is no air-conditioning. I don't think that I would try in summer even if it were free!"
304,662,"Mar 23 2005	A nice place to stay	My family stayed here March 12-15 with a British Air package. My sister and I had a twin room, and my parents had a double room (although it was a queen-sized bed). My room was very clean and looked recently renovated. It was small by U.S. standards, but had everything that we would want: comfortable bed, clean bath and shower, desk, tv, phone, and a closet. My parents' room was a bit older, and looked a little more worn. However, it was also clean and came with the same amenities. Breakfast was included with our room and consisted of rolls with butter and jam, ham, cheese, cereal, milk, juice, tea, and coffee. It was pretty good - at least for someone who is not a big breakfast eater! The location was great. It is a block away from Lancaster Gate Tube station. It was closed the first two days, so we took a bus to Marble Arch, which is only about 4-5 blocks further. It is about a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station, which is also very convenient. We took a taxi from the station once we arrive in London (because of all of our luggage), and it was only a few pounds. The hotel is right on Hyde Park, with great views. All in all, it was a great place to stay. I would certainly stay there again."
305,662,"Mar 11 2005	Friendly Corus	I stayed at the Corus from 4th - 7th March 2005. I arrived at Euston train station and took the bus (390) direct to hotel - Fare 1 20p Alight at Lancaster Gate by the underground station. My room was a standard single, very small but clean. It was adequate for a few days. There was an open fronted wardrobe with hanging space of about 18&quot;. The single bed was too small for me (I am 6'4&quot;) and the dovet cover only came up to my shoulders but an extra blanket was provided.Breakfast arrangements were excellent and stress free. Guests on Continental B&amp;B use a different restuarant than those wanting a full English breakfast. This cuts down the lengthy wait a busy times. The staff are some of the most helpful and friendly I have ever encountered.I would certainly stay again but hopefully in a larger room"
306,662,"Mar 8 2005	Great for a moderately priced London hotel	We got this hotel via a British Airways package. I was a little afraid after reading the other reviews but the room was great! It was small but average size for a big city, moderately priced hotel. Breakfast was great as well. Room and bathroom were sparkling clean. Location was top notch. Two complaints -- staff did not give us one wake up call, and lift (elevator) service was spotty. One morning we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we could get on a lift going down, and the only staircase led out to an alarmed door so that wasn't an option. And one of the concierges could have been a bit more helpful. All in all, a great deal -- we were more than pleased with the Corus. I'd definitely stay there again."

We had a standard room which was very small by American standards, had no drawers to put your belongings in and no closet - only a rack in the room to hang your clothes from. The rooms were spotless, however and tastefully remodeled in a very contemporary style. The hairdryer was underneath the desk and you had to sit down to dry your hair because the cord wasn't very long. My husband is 5'4&quot; and he had some trouble getting out of the high-sided tub. Remember to bring a washcloth or shower scrubby as these are not provided. Shampoo, soap and shower gel are in the rooms. If you need conditioner for your hair, bring that too. We very much enjoyed the continental breakfast that was provided. Hard rolls with jelly and butter, croissants, a variety of packaged cheeses, some cold ham, red grapefruit and orange juices, cold cereals with milk, canned mandarin oranges and grapefruit sections, coffee, tea, and decaf with steamed milk most days. The view of Hyde Park while eating breakfast was wonderful. If you want to take your second cup of coffee on the road, bring a travel mug as they don't have any paper cups with lids. The concierge was extremely helpful. Also, all the staff were polite and friendly. We did not get one wake-up call on the first day after a nap - but woke up shortly therafter so it was not a problem. All the morning wake-up calls did happen. Our room was ready when we got to the hotel about 10:30 a.m. - which was a godsend! They stored our luggage at no charge on the last day while we did some final sightseeing before we left for the airport. Our room had a view of a brick wall - but we were not there for the view. We were not disturbed by any outside noises but kept the fan on all night because we like whitenoise when we sleep. The bed was comfortable and we slept well every night. We only used the Lancaster Gate station (one block away) because it was so close and once we were on the tube, we were able to transfer anywhere we wanted to go from there. We took a short black cab ride from our hotel to Paddington station to get the Heathrow Express back to the airport. We could have walked it but didn't want to with so much luggage. I highly recommend using this way to get to and from the airport rather than a &quot;hotel transfer&quot; by Hotelink included or added on to a package. The only reason I would stay elsewhere next time is that I liked other areas of town better. Marylebone, Covent Gardens and Soho were all favorites and seemed to be more in the &quot;thick of things.&quot; Otherwise, I would go back to the Corus in a minute."
309,662,"Feb 3 2005	Perfect for us!	BACKGROUND: This hotel was included in a package deal from British Airways. We were visiting from Washington, DC, and stayed from Saturday Jan. 29th through Monday Jan. 31st, 2005. I liked it upon sight, probably because I'm used to very Holiday Inn/Comfort Inn kinds of hotels. LOBBY: It seemed &quot;upscale&quot; to me - very clean, with a nice open lobby full of places to sit down and people-watch, and the style of furnishings seemed very contemporary - nice bright colors, art, assymmetric couches, etc.SERVICE: I wouldn't say there was a &quot;friendly&quot; feel to the hotel (I can't remember any smiling ...), but all the staff was very professional, helpful, and polite. We were able to leave our bags at the concierge desk and get something to eat, then came back to check in at 2:00 p.m. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST (free): Breads, fruit, cheeses, cereal, coffee, hot chocolate, oj - your basic continental offerings. We thought everything was yummy. ROOM: I also took pictures of the decor in here because I loved the clean, modern style of the room. It was, indeed, quite small, but we were in a 3-star hotel in Rome that was even smaller, so we were prepared for that. It was more than enough room to shower, sleep, and have our bags/clothes accessible. They had a TV, coffeemaker, pants press, safe, and toiletries in each room. Everything was very clean, and the water in the shower was hot and plentiful - something I'm always grateful for. OTHER: The one thing we had a problem with was a gaggle of people waiting at our 4th floor elevator in the mornings. We tried to find stairs, but could only find staircases marked &quot;for fire emergency only.&quot; LOCATION: We thought this was a convenient location because the tube was right down the block, and the bus stop for the tour buses was right around the corner. We also enjoyed the pub next door, &quot;The Swan.&quot; We had lunch there one day, then stopped in both nights on our way back to the hotel for a nightcap (or three) and live music. The people were very friendly here and we found people to talk to very easily.Overall, we enjoyed our stay here, but would probably experiment with another hotel if we were to come back, only because we like to try new things. We might also stay in one of the busier areas, like Covent Garden or Piccadilly Circus or Soho instead."
310,662,"Jan 25 2005	Mediocre And I Don't Ask For Much	The biggest problem with this hotel is the size of the rooms. I am 5'4&quot; and when I spread out I could touch my feet to one wall and my fingers almost touched the other. However, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it wasn't horrible. Also, if you have problems getting in/out of the shower (elderly, disabled) you may find it impossible here. The shower was about a three foot step up over a railing. I found it a little hard at times.The smoking never bothered us.... yes, there was smoking in the lobby and in the hallways, but it was never overwhelming.The staff could've been more efficient. They were never rude, but when we wanted to stay two extra days it took several trips to the front desk and several phone calls. We also never got 3 wake up calls, which made us angry. (There wasn't an alarm clock in the room- the tv told the time).On the plus side, it was a good location. We walked to Portobello Road and Harrod's and the V&amp;A museum, and of course, Hyde Park. It was also just minutes from Paddinton Station and right on a tube line.All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, just mediocre, and I don't ask for much. I don't think I would stay here again."
311,662,"Jan 24 2005	Recommend staying in the Corus	My wife and I have just returned after staying in the Corus Hyde Park from 13th - 16th of January 2005. The hotel location is perfect - directly across from Hyde Park and and less than 1 minutes walk from Lancaster Gate underground station which has a very good service, (a train every couple of minutes) and only takes a few minutes to get into Centarl London. We found the hotel staff to be very helpful and although the rooms are quite small, they were cleaned everyday. The only problem we found with the room was the fact that you can hear people talking in the rooms next door as the walls are very thin and not very well sound proofed. Unfortunately the hotel also had a fire drill at about 8am on the Sunday morning which wasn't great as we had been out late the previous night enjoying ourselves!! Apart from those little issues I would recommend the hotel simply for it's price, location and cleanliness."
312,662,"Jan 21 2005	Good Hotel Good Location	My husband and me arrived yesterday from Corus Hyde Park, and we loved it.We were afraid of all the bad things that we read on the others reviews (tinny bedrooms, lots of smoking areas...) but we had no problems.We stayed for 5 nights in one renewed room. We can't say that it was a big bedroom, but all the rooms in London Hotel's are smaller than usual (for big rooms must try the Sheraton, Ritz)...It was not a problem for us because we had enough space for our luggage...and we only use the hotel to sleep and take a bath.The bedroom was exactly like on the internet photos, with a little table, one armchair, security chest, shelfs, closet to put clothes with drawers...and a beautiful view to Hyde Park (we can see the squirrels from our windows). We also had everything we needed to make a coffee/tea, and cookies everyday. Everything was very clean.The hotel staff was always very gentle and helpful.We had continental breakfast (bread, croissants, jam, honey, butter, cheese, ham, milk, coffee, tea, chocolate, corn flakes, bran flakes, orange juice)... For us its more than enough!The hotel lobby have sofas and a restaurant/bar. There is one Internet point too. In the concierge we can leave the luggage if we arrive too soon to check in or if we check out and have the plain later and want to visit more things without the luggageand we dont have to pay more for it, like happens in others hotels.Lancaster Gate is in the Central Line so we can go everywhere by tube and the tube terminal is only 2 minutes walking from the hotel. In a distance of one station we are in Oxford Street.It was not my first time in London but it was my first time in Corus Hyde Park. I will not come back for a simply reason: I like to try new hotels in new zones wherever I go. But it was a very good experience."
313,662,"Jan 10 2005	Too hot for Summer...	Although I stayed in this hotel in July 2004, I only just found this site!Anyway, the standard rooms are small compared to US standards, with the double/queen size bed being only accessible from one side. The other side is against the wall. The bed was comfortable and made up with a white duvet.Wooden shutters cover the windows. There is a desk, and a wardrobe rail (not actually a wardrobe- just a rail!). The rooms are actually quite trendy and painted in neutral white decor. The bathroom is also white and is small but adequate. The rooms were very clean.There is a kettle, and a small tin containing teabags, coffee and biscuits. There is also a trouser press and a fan mounted on the wall.The main problem with this hotel is the temperature in the room. There is no aircon and hot summer nights in London are unbearable!! The wall mounted fan is totally useless. In addition, lots of guests leave their door ajar to try and get some air through. This makes the hotel seem very noisy. The hotel is also located on a busy road opposite Hyde Park.The best thing about this hotel is the location. Very central and convenient for Lancaster Gate tube station. I would stay here again, but not in summer."
314,662,"Jan 8 2005	Non-smokers may have a problem.	As a Californian, I forgot how much Europeans smoke. The lobby at this hotel has inadequate ventilation and we couldn't get through it fast enough. I requested a non-smoking room, but upon check-in was told they wouldn't have one until the following day. I held my ground and got one. The lobby furniture is shabby, but the room was clean and the beds were comfortable. No more than 2 of the 3 elevators worked at a time (often less). The location is good (a little more than a block from the Lancaster Gate tube) and across Bayswater Rd. from Hyde Park. The staff was excellent and they have concierge services. If you are a smoker, you will be quite happy here and, if the price is right, I would stay again. By the way, save yourself $$ and take the tube instead of the Heathrow express. Paddington station is quite a hike compared to the tube station. You will have to change trains and haul your luggage, but travel light and you will be fine."
315,662,"Nov 2 2004 	Everything I asked for	Have been residing in Hyde Park hotel for a twoday conference in London. In my quest for a hotel I focused on a straight forward Business Hotel, with no extras and got everything I asked for.Perfectly located, near Lancaster Gate tube and Paddington Railway station to Heathrow just five minutes away.Hyde Park just across the hotel and around the corner Praed street with all its restaurants etc.Room was at 7th floor, nicely renovated, clean etc. None of the 'problems' I have read in other reviews were applicable to my stay. Really enjoyed it, will come back"
316,662,"Oct 18 2004	Small but convenient	My boyfriend and I spent a weekend here in the Spring when we decided to take in a musical. We both found it well located, with the nearby tube stations able to take us quickly wherever we wanted to go. Although we knew all accomodation in London is usually small, we were both surprised by the narrow accomodations- the nautical decor in our room really did make it feel like we were staying on a cruise ship! The window did not open and that was unfortunate as the room can get steamy. Small but well laid out bathroom, with a full bath/shower. A treat for budget hotels. Very comfortable bed and our room was quite clean. Adequate breakfast. I would consider staying here again, if we found the right internet deal."
317,662,"Oct 12 2004	Not bad at all	Although the Corus would not have been my first choice to stay in, I have a friend who works for the hotel chain and he managed to get me a deal I couldn't turn down, so off we went.My wife and I stayed there for two nights over the 8th and 9th October as we were visiting London for my 40th birthday, and I must say I was pleasantly suprised.The hotel was very bright and clean, not in the least bit grubby like some hotels you visit, and the staff were friendly and informative.We'd flown down early, but even at 9.30am, the staff allowed us into our room, which was a real bonus.If you're getting the train, then Paddington is less than half a mile away, but Lancaster Gate tube station is only 200 yards away. Get on here for the Central Line, which takes you right into London where you can change lines for wherever you want to go.Getting, back to the hotel, the room was spotless, everything worked and there was no sign of wear or tear. What I would say though, was the standard room was very small and this may put a lot of people off unless you want to upgrade, which I think was 30.00 per night. Saying that, most of the time we were out and about touring the city and only came back to shower, change or sleep, so for us it was no great hassle. If you were intending spending a great deal of time in the room, then it might be a different matter.At night, the bar in the lounge was open well after midnight for anybody wanting a late drink and the surroundings were very pleasant.To summarise, as long as you don't mind a particularly small room, then the Corus was a very pleasant hotel, in a good location across from the parks, handy for the tube and a lot brighter than some 4 star hotels I've been in."
318,662,"Aug 29 2004	We all liked the hotel except...	I stayed at Corus with my family in August for six nights. We all loved it! The twin rooms are clean, the bathroom is fine, and the Japanese futon-style blanket is very comfortable. Everyday there's a supply of tea bags, milk, sugar and cookies, plus a plug-in tea kettle for us to enjoy a nice cup of English tea. Hyde Park and Kensington Park across the street provides wonderful space for a walk and my daughter loved feeding ducks and swans there. It's convenient to get around, aside from a near-by tube station, bus routes 12 and 94 go directly to the center of the city. But while we were there, every morning around 6:30 or 7:00, there would be trucks unloading (or loading) right below our windows, and it's incredibly noisy! I was seriously sleep-deprived. Three days later when we returned from Edinburgh and checked in another room on the 6th floor, the noise level was much better. However, this time the weird faucet above the bathtub didn't work and we had to ask the housekeeping for help. Plus the blankets are not futon-style. All in all, our experience with Corus is nice. I will go back to it should we have another chance to travel to London."
319,662,"Aug 21 2004	Lovely hotel	I stayed with my two daughters ages 12 and 15 at the Corus for 6 days. I was told that the room would nt be air-conditioned but it was and it was great. The room was an excellent size but we did have a problem finding place to store our clothes so some of them remained in the suitcase which bothered us. In general we had a good experience at the hotel. No complaints. Everything was clean and the Concierge was very helpful when we needed advice how to travel. In truth, I may not stay there again - instead, might find something a bit more central with more underground line access(although waking up and seeing Hyde Park every morning was lovely)."
320,662,"Aug 11 2004	Nice A/C Hotel okay location	Just returned from London where I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park. Location is just north of Hyde Park, 1 block west of Lancaster Gate Tube (Central Line only), 3 blocks east of Queensway. It was only a 10 minute walk to Paddington Station where we could get Central, District, Circle, Bakerloo tube lines to anywhere in town. Best thing about the hotel was the air conditioning. London can be very hot in the summer and the a/c was much appreciated after a long day. The continental breakfast provided was very basic: croissants, hard rolls, and cold cereal. For a few pounds more, you could have a full English breakfast but we never did. The hotel lobby is very nice, lots of seating and places to hold a quick meeting, if needed. The bar was small but fully stocked. Rooms varied quite a bit. My single room was small, one of the triple rooms was enormous, the double rooms were also on the small side. All rooms were clean and housekeeping was friendly and helpful. The hotel would, of course, exchange currency but had a rather high fee. There was a no-commission currency exchange half a block from the front of the hotel. The Swan pub was just behind the hotel, there were plenty of restaurants near the hotel, including the Concordia Italian Restaurant (very good). Having Hyde Park just across the street was nice and made it possible for those interested in (additional) exercise to run each morning. I'm not sure I would stay there again, not because there was anything wrong with the hotel, I just prefer different areas of town."
321,662,"Aug 9 2004	Nice and clean	Although the room and hotel were spotless and staff very friendly, the room was so hot we could not sleep. Room also very small but venue was ideally located for tube station and Hyde Park. Would stay again but not in summer !"
322,662,"Jul 19 2004	Nice hotel but won't return	My husband and I stayed here July 15 - 18, 2004 and found the accomodations to be adequate, although the room was on the small side. The air condintioning supposedly didn't go below 16 C (60 F), but it felt more like 26 C (about 80 F). Granted the temperature was nice, but after long days of touring London and spending time on the Tube, we would have liked a cooler room. Our room overlooked Bayswater Road which is very noisy until about midnight. Lancaster Gate, while located only about five minutes away, isn't the most efficient tube stop as it is on the Central Line with no connections. The staff was extremely helpful and the room was kept absolutely spotless. We chose to eat breakfast in our room every morning instead of going to the dining room. The continental breakfast was more that filling, but we had to ask for a form every morning even though the form was supposed to be left in our room during cleaning. We will most likely skip this hotel on return trips and instead stay at hotels in the Kennsington area. They are located near more attractions, food, internet cafes and a better value for our money and time."
323,662,"Jun 29 2004	Ok for one night but not that great	Stayed in this hotel for my sisters hen night on July 12th 2003. Got a special deal as 8 of us were staying there so only cost us 50 each so pretty good for a central hotel in London. Checked in ok but our rooms werent ready when we got there in the morning, check in I think was between 2-4pm so we left our luggage with the Concierge who were nice and helpful, although I dont think they spoke much English!When we got to our rooms they just had one single bed in them, they were tiny but clean and just what we were after for one night. Although they were really warm, no air conditioning, and this was in the height of Britains heat wave, even opening the window didnt do anything and it was a bit nosey outside, think my room overlooked the bags of rubbish outside the kitchens or something!Bed was pretty comfortable but the shower was a bit of a nightmare to get into, the bath was really high and there wasnt much room for manovere! Breakfast the next day was average but it was self service so you could help yourself.Basically you couldnt swing a cat in this room, but for one nights stay its ok, just dont go in the height of summer, or if you do bring your own fan!"
324,662,"Jun 14 2004	Hot way too hot!!!!!	I stayed in this hotel for 10 days with a friend. Even though the room is somewhat small, we did not have any problems unpacking our staff and managed not to bump into each other. I do not see a problem with a room size, especially when you come to see London, and not the inside of your room. Shower was a different story. Not only the tub was so high that it was uncomfortable to get in, it was also so smal, you were constantly bumping into the wall. However, even that was not the worst thing. The room was unbearably hot, despite of the open window. There is a fan in the room, but it is mounted to the ceilingt so it blows air at one spot only and if you are 10 inches from that spot - tough. The only computer in the hotel was out of order for the entire time we were there. Also this hotel has the weirdest policy I have ever heard of. When you check in they ask you for you credit card info, even if your stay there was prepaid. It is done so they coud charge you 20 pounds a day (about $37.00) deposit in case you make a call, use a restaurant or else. At the end of your stay you are supposed to settle the bill. When we refused, our phone line was cut off and the only calls we could make were to the reception. Once I had to make an emergency call to the US in the middle of the night - it took a lot of arguing to get the lines open, only to be hit with outrageous charges: About $4.00 for connection, and $1.00 per minute. You are much better of buying a Royal Mail phone card and using a pay phone. God forbid you do not pay right away - they will hunt you down! Continental breakfast (included) was awfull and English breakfast, for which they charge about $7.00 upgrade per day is not much better. The only two things that are going for this hotel are its location (close to the city Center) and its cleanliness. I would not stay there again."
325,662,"May 27 2004	Nice good place	We had some offer through Legal and General to stay in Corus 2 nights and pay for one. The hotel is one excellent place, very near tubes but is not too far for walking through Hyde park and St James park to Big Ben. They offer chipper parking. They gave us one very small room and on the end put us in the basement without lift. The room was big with sofa for our girl and they provide us with cot bed for baby. Nothing was special but nice. Just one thing put me of. The high chair was always dirty! We had one meal there and porcion was very big and nice. Breakfast was standard. It was worth of money, two for one night..."

1,665,"Nov 21 2009 	Excellent Value	We are budget travellers preferring to make the most of our time exploring our destination. This hotel is cheap, clean and in a fantastic location. It was actually a lot better than expected having read the reviews and the only real criticism we had was the quality of the sausages at breakfast! The staff were friendly and the County Bar was comfortable and drinks were good value for money.Don't be put off if you want somewhere to sleep after a long day and night in London - this place is just the job."
2,665,"Nov 10 2009 	It`s absolutely Fine For Budgest Travellers	Some people who have reviewed this hotel seem to expect a five star hotel for a one star price.Wake up people! London is one of the most expensive cities in the world. To get a single room plus breakfast for 43 is about as cheap as you are going to find without going into a youth hostel dormitory. If you are in London for a short period of time, and are only planning to be in your hotel to sleep, then this place is perfect. If you are planning on a romantic break and want to dine in the hotel, then look elsewhere.The hotel was built in the 30`s and probably last refubished in the 70`s. My room was small, the furniture old and tatty, and the TV didn`t work. But, the bed linen was clean, the two towels were clean, and the communal toilets and bathrooms were clean. The full English breakfast was a buffet style help yourself affair, and whilst the food wasn`t fantastic, it was OK, and filled me up for the rest of the day. If you want to leave your bags after you check out it will cost you 50p, which won`t exactly break the bank.Best of all is the location. It`s about 5 mins walk from Kings Cross &amp; St Pancras, and about 1 minute from Euston. The Northern line tube at Euston means you can be in Oxford Street or Leicester square ten minutes after leaving the hotel. The neighbourhood is fine too, the Hilton Hotel being on the other side of the street, and there is a Premier inn just a little way around the corner (Although it`s twice the price and doesn`t include breakfast).If you are a genuine budget traveller who knows that you get what you pay for, then you will have no problems at all staying here. If you are the kind of person who finds Travelodge or Ibis to be downmarket then you want the Hilton over the road."
3,665,"Nov 6 2009 	cheap clean and funny	as a traveller from abroad i must say this hotel has certain qualities of the same kind as london tube, double-deckers and fish and chips wrapped in news papers. first you are a bit shocked how worn-out everything is, but the longer you stay the stronge you go under its charm. very good for its price. we had very small but clean room, clean bed clothes every day. all the facilities were clean. breakfast was very &quot;english&quot; - as it was supposed to be - maybe even too much, all the saussages, bacon, beans.... we would appreciate youghurt. town transport very close, very close to the center.the only thing i found annoying was that you enter your room right from the common corridor, so if unlucky of neighbours the room can be a bit noisy.i would return here if i travelled to london again."
4,665,"Sep 16 2009 	old and smelly..	My boyfriend and I have been in London for 3 days and 2 nights and we have been in County hotel.. the hotel is very close to the centre of the city (very near to British Museum) and it's well served by the tube and buses.. and this is the best (and only) quality of this hotel!the hotel is old, smelly and very very fatiscent! the room (we were at 6th floor!!) was small, and there are no service inside the room, just a very little washbasin were you should wash your hands..but it's pretty impossible!the windows are so dirty that you can't look trough!the bed linen was clean, but the pillow was very very dirty and smelly! I could'nt use it!!!the bath was not too bad, it was clean and essential even if there are no washbasin so when you go to the wc you have to come back to the room for wash your hands! foolish!we were lucky because we were the only user of this bathroom! but i won't imagine when there are people of 4 rooms using it!the breakfast is simple, essential and not too bad..Finally I think I won't come back again..and of course there's something better!"
5,665,"Sep 5 2009 	County Hotel - Count us out	There may be worse hotels in the Greater London area, but you will have great difficulty in finding one. Problems included dirty surroundings, a lift which smelt of urine. harsh lighting, communal bathrooms, poor service from staff. All in all an experience you would want to forget as soon as possible. The best feature of our stay was that it was only for one night. Not an experience we would want to repeat in a hurry. We did not stay for breakfast, after an uninvited visitor to our room, who could not be discerned to be a member of staff or of the public,as when I screamed in horror they beat a fast retreat. We rushed out of the establishment as fast as possible, absolutely horrified."
6,665,"Aug 4 2009 	Its not that bad!	I stayed here for one night with a friend and I do not think it is as bad as others said!Its a budget hotel! Its old fashioned and in need of a paint job but it was clean and the Buffet breakfast was very good! I saw the chef comein several times and replenish the food.You do have shared bathrooms but the showers were certainly powerful!You get what you pay for and its no frills but if you just want somewhere central to put your head down then you could do a lot worse!The porters were rather abrubt though and it is in a time warp. Also, ask for a room at the back as the traffic can be a bit noisy!"
7,665,"Aug 4 2009 	Great little find - cheap 	This cheap &amp; cheerfull hotel is extremely well situated near Euston Station &amp; other well known landmarks ie British Museum. The staff were friendly &amp; the price was nice. The room itself was basic &amp; included a small tv, a kettle etc &amp; it was very clean. I would definately recommend this hotel &amp; I hope it remains as is for a while yet.Any &quot;upgrades&quot; to the hotel will result in higher prices being charged. Its not the Ritz Hotel but it definately cuts the mustard."
8,665,"Aug 3 2009 	Avoid this place at all cost!	The County Hotel in London is the most miserable place I've ever seen... Me and my partner are budget travellers and we've been to London loads of times, but no hotel or hostel we've ever stayed at prepared us for this... The reception area is a dark and gloomy hole, with dirty carpet and a low grey broken ceiling. The whole place feels like a prison... Our room was on the third floor, and above the door was a terribly dusty and dirty grid. The room is lit by fluorescent tubes, making for a atmosphere as far away from cosy as you could possibly imagine. There were several locks on the door, increasing the feeling of unsafety. The TV was from the 1980s and everything else in the room was broken. We half expected to find a dead body in the wardrobe. As soon as we entered the room we went down again to cancel the other nights we'd booked at this terrible place. Fortunately this was no problem, in fact the staff hardly seemed surprised when I told them we thought the hotel was terrible. We hardly slept there. At 8:30 a most unfriendly cleaning woman kept knocking with her keys on our door and trying to push it open. Fortunately; we'd locked the door! We didn't bother staying for breakfast but from what I read here we didn't miss out on anything. Don't go to this hotel, if you want cheap accomodation in London, try on of the EasyHotels...Their rooms only cost half as the County's and they're ensuite, clean and modern!"
9,665,"Jul 25 2009 	Me and my grandson at the County..wish we'd gone elsewhere	I didn't think hotels like this existed anymore!! From the seedy, dirty, paper strewn reception to the even seedier Concierge desk this plac.e is just dreadful.I had a 5 year old with me so couldn't just move around and find somewhere else.It's grotty, miserable, dropping to pieces and depressing. Staff are not interested and in short supply. My room was a disgrace....budget or not, nothing should be this bad.STEER CLEAR...cheap rooms, well, even for cheap this was 100% over charging."
10,665,"Jul 25 2009 	You get what you pay for.	I stayed here over night for 1 night this week as everything was last minute. Im used to quite fancy places as a rule, so i expected the worst.The price was 43 for a single for 1 night including breakfast.(doubles/twins 56)The staff at reception were fins and i checked in ok and found my room on the first floor.the room is nothing at all to write about, just a bed a small tv wardrobe, chair and a sink. but it was clean, i checked the bed and that was clean.its not the place you would want to be in your room too long, just a place to crash.the room had strip flourecent lighting, which is very odd.The breakfast was surprisingly ok, a full on english breakfast with all the things you would expect to find.my over all verdict would be, its great for a short time or just to crash out.bear in mind, also, that its quite central london and at the price its a steal.what do people expect for that price?? most hotels start around 80 upwards in that area. people need to get real, at this hotel you do get what you pay for, and at that price for a short time, i have no complaints."
11,665,"Jul 23 2009 	Cheap for London	The County Hotel is one of those seedy hotels you are either going to love or hate. Its got a lot of character even though the paint is peeling off the walls and there is a strange smell in the air. I paid about 40 per night which is not bad. You don't get much for that. The rooms are cramped, the beds are lumpy and if you want a wash you will have to walk down one of those spooky corridors that looks like something out of The Shining! The showers are actually worth the effort. The County hotel is in a pretty good location. I found it really useful for catching the Eurostar to Brussels (ten minute walk). Its also in a great location to visit the British Museum and there is a Tube Station at Euston, which is just a hop across the road. From there its only a couple of stops to the centre of London."
12,665,"Jul 8 2009 	Jeepers!!! Stay Away From Here	I understand, and also need to budget when traveling but listen,some places are better off closed and this hole is one of themIm not a snob but this hotel is horrible, the so called budget price isnt relevant to the grubby, sticky battered rooms, lifts, bar, and just about any other part of this place you happen to walk into.Anybody thinking this place is value for money needs a reality check as you can get better cleaner places for just a few pounds more without breaking the bank. Dont be fooled by the pictures from the website I can assure you it doesnt look like them now!Anybody with military back ground think back to the block rooms and toilets of a 1950s barracksAnd there you go, thats the County hotel (without the spit and polish)If you think Im being harsh then fair enough, but you have now been warned and Im telling you like it is. I was so disappointed when we walked into the place but it had already been paid for....I can assure you if It hadnt had been paid for up front I would not have stayedMarks out of 10 ..........3......... and thats only because the porter was the only helpful person there.I have found other user reviews and I cannot believe what I read when they give it a good score what on earth are they on? you cannot justify dirt and no cleaning regarless of costIf youre going to London to see a show or whatever why ruin your trip for the sake of saving a few pounds. Im Sorry County Hotel but you need to sort this place out big time heres one example of many....just go and look at the carpet in the bar by the window and tell me im wrong!I Recommend that everybody stays away from this place and find another hotelI only wish id checked the reviews when my mate told me hed booked it"
13,665,Jul 2 2009 	In need of change	First the positives. The hotel is easy access from Euston station and compared to many hotels in London it comes out relatively cheap. Been racking my brain trying to think of other things but haven't come up with any.The facilites are miserable. The door to my room looked as though it had been kicked in and was flimsy. Felt a bit doubtful about leaving anything in the room. The room itself can best be described as basic. The shared toilets and showers are archaic. There seemed to be a constant stream of laundy packed around the corridors.Breakfast was grotty and the crockery and cutlery had all seen better days and were grubby. I don't think it was the age of the knife that prevented me cutting into the sausages; it was more that they seemed to have a closer connection to leather than meat.The staff gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere else than in the hotel and the attitude to guests was that we were a bit in the way rather than the reasons why they were in work.Overall this place needs to improve both in terms of its customer care and the quality and range of its facilities. Not the worse place I have stopped at but closer to that end of the scale than the other.
14,665,Jun 30 2009 	Don't even think about it!	I've stayed in much cleaner and certainly more pleasant youth hostels for half the price. The place was filthy and the staff were rude and unhelpful. Stay full clear of the place.
15,665,"Apr 29 2009	Simple cheap and conveniently located	The hotel is very simple and completely tasteless, but it is cheap, clean and conveniently located. Even the shared bathrooms were always available, clean and had hot water. Also, the breakfast were very good."
16,665,"Apr 28 2009 	What a BUDGET """" find""""	The hotel was built in the 1930's and is in mint condition. All the rooms have shared baths tub /great shower head with hot water that are very clean and convenient to the rooms. For  43 per nite (( sing)) incl a fab full english buffet brakfast it's a great deal.And I might add that the location from Heathrow via the Picadilly line off at Russell Sq is Soooooo nice. And it's close to EVERYTHING !! Oh yeah and the pub attached has great cheap daily food lunch and dinner but your on your own for Sat and Sun ( they off )Superb bus connections Euston Station Cambden Mkt,...."
17,665,"Apr 26 2009 	Not the nicest place!	Immediately as I walked through the door into this hotel I realised that I had made a mistake in booking a room here! I wasn't expecting much for 43 per night, but even at that price I was rather disappointed. All I was expecting was a clean room with friendly staff, but this was too much to ask for from County Hotel.After waiting 15 minutes to check in (there was someone in front of me making a complaint (!), and only one person on reception), I was rudely informed that I had mispelt my own surname when making the booking (which I obviously hadn't)! Eventually I managed to check in and was given a room on the 4th floor. The room was small, with a TV that did not have a remote, a wash basin and a small cupboard with some empty spirit bottles that someone had obviously left behind and the cleaners not taken away!In the morning I was prompty woken up by a cleaner who entered my room immediately after knocking giving me no time to speak (!) which was then followed by an interrogation into what time I would be leaving so that she could &quot;clean&quot; the room.The rooms were not clean (by any stretch of imagination), and neither were the communal areas, including the main reception area, bathrooms, stairwells, and dining room. Not only did nothing look clean but you could actually physically pick up the dirt!Even for 43 pn this is a disappointing hotel and not good value for money, despite the location."
18,665,"Apr 21 2009 	Rude Staff Dirty Places No Sleep!	I stayed here as a stopover before an early morning coach tour to Europe as it was cheaper than the one the tour company suggested. Location was perfect for what I wanted, and at a price I could afford.I arrived before check-in, and was told by the ?Spanish receptionist to take my bag to the porter and check in later. She didn't even want to see any documents to check I did actually have a reservation (I'm now thinking &quot;Free Left Luggage in London!&quot;). Room was tiny, and so loud! I overlooked the main road which is busy all night, so didn't sleep at all! Plus, there were banging doors all night, presumably because of the bathrooms along the corridor.Bathrooms and corridors were acceptable until I found a dirty plate festering away next to the lifts! Bathroom light didn't work either so had to walk to get to one that did.I would recommend it, only as a stop-over for the tours, it's nearly 30 cheaper than one the company recommends and it's only a 5 minute walk from where the tours starts."
19,665,"Mar 24 2009 	You get what you pay for	The location of this hotel is very convenient for those arriving at Kings Cross, St Pancras, or Euston stations, and is very centrally situated in the Bloomsbury area of London, near the British Museum. It is very reasonably priced by London standards, which compensates for its shortcomings (in my view). The main limitation is that WCs and shower/bathrooms are shared, which means that they are not always terribly hygenic, although they are serviced and cleaned every day. The single room I stayed in was clean enough, but very tatty, and, like the whole hotel, badly in need of refurbishing and decorating. The breakfasts provided a reasonable choice of cereals, fried foods, etc. Staff are not particularly helpful or friendly, although I think that is not unusual for London hotels. The porters were particularly surly, and the serving staff in the restaurant not much better. I think that the hotel does offer reasonable value for money, and is OK if you just look on the hotel as a roof over your head while visiting the exciting city of London."
20,665,"Mar 8 2009 	sleeping in a morgue would be better!!	i booked this place as my girlfiriend and i were coming down to london for three days and we were on a budget. as you walk into the hotel, and i use the hotel in its loosest terms - the dullness and grime in the place hits you straight away. the lobby is in desparate need of a lick of paint maybe even a replastering and the carpet has less thread on it than duncan goodhew. the rooms, what can one say about the rooms, i am sure the rooms in strangeways or any other prison are better and would seem like luxury. again the carpets were threadbare, the sheets although clean looked like they hadn't been replaced in 30 years. on closing the door you are greeted by the worlds fastest closing door which slams with the force of a one megaton atom bomb!! the walls shake as it closes, guests can here every door close in the entire hotel. The shared bathroom was basic to say the least, urine stained tiles were all around the toilet area and the showers had certainly seen better days, the 1950's come to mind. i had the unfortunate punishment of being ill while i was in london and spending a full evening in my prison cell of a room, all i can say is dirt, you just had the impression that everything was dingey and dirty. the hotel from basement to roof is in need of a serious makeover. it is located just a few yards away from where the tavistock bus bomb went off a few years ago, and much as that was a terrible incident and a crime it was a shame it did not damage this hotel as it is in dire need of a refurb!!!!the plus points and this is scraping the barrel is its location, good for tube and mainline stations. if you are on a budget, choose a youth hostel or a premier inn instead as this place is trully poor and a crime against &quot;hotels&quot;"
21,665,"Jan 28 2009 	Fair enough	Stayed Nov 08 - third time I have used it. Brilliant/the Ritz it is not - quite adequate for the price and location it certainly is. Single room, shared bathroom and WC. A handy place and (if you are into hypersaturated fats) no doubt adequate fry-up breakfast that will see you through much of the day. Spotless linen (not sure about the carpet though), WC likewise.The (new) receptionist was more used to giving orders than taking them. That might be a consideration for a fourth stay."
22,665,Jan 4 2009 	Fine if you don't spend much time there	If you just want somewhere to sleep and more cash for the shops then this is ok. Our room was clean including the beds. The communal showers and loos were also clean. The staff are very unhelpful so we ot all our info from tourist information. The whole place does have a musty smell and is all very old. From talking to another guest I found out this used to be student accomodation and it is as if the students have left yesterday. Should be a hostel rather than a hotel.Breakfast good with lots of choice. Overall clean and cheap but if you want to spend anytime here book the Travelodge opposite which looked nice
23,665,"Dec 29 2008	Just say NO to the County Hotel	The County Hotel is a wretched establishment. It is far dirtier, less organized, less friendly and less spacious than most of the HOSTELS (not hotels, mind you) that I stayed at in Europe! At least most hostel staff attempt to make you feel welcome, and don't act as if your presence is an irksome mistake. I felt consistently uncomfortable and unwanted at the County, and tried to spend as little time as I could in my room or the bleak and dingy lobby. I did not choose to stay at this hotel. Rather, the school at which I was studying (located in continental Europe) booked us rooms for an academic excursion in London. They even paid for English breakfasts for all of us! It would have been better if they had sprung for clean bedclothes. The breakfast included greasy eggs, mealy sausages, and other ghastly edibles. I should note that the Continental options were agreeable - especially the muesli. I stuck to the safety of cold grains and fruit, rather than risk the shimmering threat of the hot breakfast. Another unpleasant surprise came when I first walked into my room. With the proportions of a ship's cabin (on the lowest deck), a view of a back alley and a rickety bunk bed, this space did not so much beckon as glare at me. The stained sheets (the comforter had something crusted on it) and the harsh lights did nothing to allay my discomfort. Having a sink in the room is convenient, but the communal bathroom is not. And if you accidentally lock yourself out, good luck trying to get the porter to help you! They treated me and my peers with undisguised disdain and sometimes even scorn. One wonders why these people decided to enter the hotel business."
24,665,"Nov 13 2008	Don't do it	I have stayed at many low-cost ho(s)tels and had no expectations, but it was the worst place I have ever stayed in...filthy, noisy inside the hotel due to &quot;doors&quot; and even worse the streetnoise, cold as heating stopped in the night, lavabo clogged, breakfas decent choice but depressing atmosphere and not tasty...do yourself a favour and don't stay there!"
25,665,"Nov 4 2008 	Shabby 	I spent 4 nights at this hotel. I didnt expect much and thats what I got. If you were to spend one, maybe two nights in London and were just looking for somewhere to rest your head at night, Id say that this hotel was adequate, any more than that and you might start to go a little stir crazy. The room was tiny, the bed was ok and the linen clean but the pillows were paper thin, the room badly needed a coat to paint to freshen it up. The bathrooms were dingey and werent cleaned at night. The bar seemed ok, the prices were very cheap but it closed at 11 each night and was closed all day Sunday. The breakfast was reasonable except for the toast which was left on the hot buffet and went all soggy. The staff were polite but not very welcoming, didnt smile or say hello. On the whole, I wouldnt go back to this hotel unless my budget was very tight and had no other option."
26,665,"Sep 29 2008 	Hotel in the loosest sense of the word!	I made the mistake of staying in The County Hotel five years ago. Back then I vowed never to darken its door again. The weekend just past I repeated that terrible mistake. Four weeks ago I spent four wonderful days in London staying at the near by Ibis at Euston (great hotel at a good price). Then the opportunity came up of an impromptu trip but with budget constraints. This was my reasoning for parting with 84 of my hard earned cash for a room for two nights in this god forsaken dump. As you turn on to Woburn Place from Euston Road the foreboding gloom of the County hits you on the street, even the front of the building is grimy and the windows are quite possibly the dirtiest in London. As you force your way through the revolving door you are met with a large brown lobby which sets the tone for the rest of the building namely unwelcoming and inhospitable. When was this place last given a lick of paint? Check in was fairly efficient and the receptionist friendly enough. I was given my key to my cell. Cells consist of a bed, a small portable television without a remote control. A sink as there are shared bathrooms on every floor. (1 bathroom for every four bedrooms) However, the toilets are separate again to the bathroom. An uncomfortable bed with two pillows with the softness of two lumps of lead. The bed side light is a strip light which is harsh and actually brighter than he main ceiling light. I might add that the sheets appeared clean and they seem to be changed daily. Needless to say I spent two sleepless nights. The uncomfortable bed was compounded by the fact that the walls are paper thin and as no room has a bathroom there is constant flow of bedroom doors opening and closing and bathroom doors opening and closing and the sound of toilets flushing. This cacophony of doors slamming is at its height late at night as people go to bed and early in the morning. It really does not make for a restful nights sleep after a busy day of sightseeing in London. I must admit that I did not shower for the two days of my stay. I couldnt bring myself to use the bathroom facilities. The bathroom closest to my cell had three soiled towels on the floor  enough to put me off. Nor did I make use of the dinning room, despite the fact that my 84 was for bed and breakfast. I was put off by the fact that beside the kettle in my cell was a sachet of milk that was covered in some indistinguishable grim. The only modern additions to this hotel are an internet terminal in the reception which when I inserted the required 1 coin failed to connect to the net. Also there is a mobile phone charging cabinet which had enough leads cables to be able to charge any model of mobile. I didnt make use of it.I have stayed in hostels and budget hotels they had similar basic facilities but the difference was they the were spotlessly clean where as the County is just grimy and the impression given is that the staff get away with the bare minimum in terms of house keeping. The only people that would be comfortable in this dump would be people who are happy with ***** (5 letter word beginning with S)"
27,665,"Sep 13 2008 	Wouldn't go again.	My husband and I stayed at the County Hotel on 16/17th September, we found the hotel quite easily with the directions supplied.I am in a wheelchair but it was not too big an obstacle to get in.Booking in was quickly done and we received our room key from the porter who was a very travelled Australian,a lift up to the 1st floor to an exceptionally smoky room despite having requested a room that was a non smoking one!!whoever had been in before must have very bad lungs and coughing his guts up by now!!! first thing we did was open the window and get the porter to spray the room with air freshener which was effective for all of 5 minutes! We had it sprayed many times but it remained smoky even with the window open! The room was basic but quite clean.Breakfast was good to be quite honest as there was a very good selection of food and as much as you wanted,the waiters/waitresses were very friendly and helpful,couldn't fault the food at all, very clean overall in the dining room.Drawback for me was the lack of ensuite facility!One warning!! Don't book a taxi with the hotel porter as you will get ripped off!!instead just go outside and get a black cab at less than half the price!! we were horrendously overcharged and the driver used a satnav to direct him!!!this is not so with true taxi drivers in London as they have the 'knowledge training'"
28,665,"Aug 23 2008 	Great Value	This place is not as bad as some of the review suggest. The staff was friendly, the bathrooms (shared) were spotless and though the hotel did have a mothball smell, it was clean. The biggest advantages are obviously it's great location and that it's just a little over half the cost of the other budget hotels in the area. If you don't like it, it is surrounded on every side by much nicer (and more expensive) venues. If you only need your room to sleep, shower, and store you're things, it's perfect."
29,665,"Aug 17 2008 	Better than expected	Having read all the reviews about the hotel before booking (for 3 nights), I was pleasantly surprised. Staff was most friendly and helpful, bathrooms and toilets close to the room and always free and accessible and the breakfast was all right (with a British breakfast, I expect something traditional, not exotic culinary delights, and it was exactly that, and as much as you wanted). Of course, the place is basic and rather run down, but it was reasonably clean, and after all, what do you expect at that price in Central London? The location is just perfect."
30,665,"Jul 27 2008 	Pray There Isn't A Fire!	Very basic, but incredibly cheap for Central London (five minutes walk from Euston Station). Room about the size of a prison cell, and bed rather less comfortable. Toilets and bathrooms are shared between several rooms.Biggest problem came with a late night fire alarm. There are no fire notices in the rooms (is this legal?), so guests had no idea of evacuation procedure, where to assemble etc. Consequently we all stood around directly outside the entrance of what could have been a burning building. There didn't seem to be any staff on hand to help or guide until more than five minutes after the alarm sounded. A far from impressive performance.The English breakfast is okay, but very limited for vegetarians (eggs and baked beans)."
31,665,"Jul 18 2008 	be careful	A bit basic but ok, but i dont think i would stay there again,good for getting around on the tube,easy to find ,the room was very basic,the shared toilet and shower wasnt ideal but ok, the sheets were cleaned everyday as were the towels.breakfast was abit dodgy,be very careful of what you eat."
32,665,"Jun 29 2008 	ITS A DISGRACE!!	We stayed here for one night only, thank goodness, for Nelson Mandela's Birthday Concert, Hyde Park 27/06/08. It was cheap, so we weren't expecting much....we have both spent boozy weekends in dives in Blackpool and don't mind roughing it a bit on occaision. This hotel is A DISGRACE...the toilets are dirty, old and inhospitable, no wash basin to wash hands before returning to the bedroom. The corridors are high ceilinged, grubby,cold and creepy. The fixtures and fittings are old, and unsafe. The windows in our 4th floor room had no locks or fasteners and opened wide onto a sheer drop...DO NOT BRING YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN HERE!!The breakfast was rancid, only the cornflakes were edible, the waiters were oppressive,especially the doorman who acted like an extra from Tenko. The dining experience was possibly similar to eating in a victorian workhouse, but with serviettes and plastic flowers and a superficial resemblence to a hotel....you could eat as much as you wanted but the eggs for example at first looked double yolked but on examination were probably pidgeons and inedible, stomach churning!!! We were exhausted and elated after the concert and so we did sleep but woke up at 6 am to the sound of doors slamming, police sirens and church bells. The thought that anyone would book in here looking for a place to unwind after a busy day sightseeing, possibly with the idea that this is indicative of English Hospitality filled us with horror!!!Unless you are blissfully unconcerned about your environment, the safety of your children, the origins of your breakfast, a sadomasochist, or a very poor backpacker then don't stop here...PAY ANOTHER 20-30 per person AND ENJOY YOUR BUDGET HOLIDAY at a travel lodge, novotel or premier inn."
33,665,"Jun 12 2008 	you get what you pay for	During our 2 night stay at the County, we didn't have any huge complaints but felt that the entire hotel is old and in disrepair. The nearby hostel we stayed at prior to the County was in many ways nicer than this hotel. The whole place smelled weird and the decor was all very old and shabby. Our room didn't have any problems except being old and shabby just like everything else. It was reasonably clean but the carpets, curtains, and bedspread all looked dirty. The bed sheets and towels were clean though. We hardly spent any time in our room as we were out sightseeing all day every day, and as a place to sleep it was sufficient. The shared bathroom facilities were clean enough and functional. The great location is probably the best thing about the hotel. As far as staff, some were helpful while others were not. The receptionist at check in didn't show the slightest hint of interest or friendliness, but the porter who helped us arrange an early morning taxi to the train station and wake-up call was very helpful. If you are looking for a place with any amount of character or charm, then the County is not for you. But, if all you need is a cheap place to sleep at night then the County might be a good option."
34,665,"Jun 12 2008 	The negative reviews are false.	After reading some of the negative reviews, we were a bit nervous about staying here, but our fears were unfounded, this place was perfect for us. The location is very central; some days we just walked to the attractions rather than take the tube. The English breakfast buffet was most generous we had in our three weeks of traveling Europe, there were eggs, toast, beans, sausage, and bacon, and if you're not into that, there are also cereal, juice, and tea. The &quot;seasoned travelers&quot; who wrote a negative review clearly need some more seasoning: Sure, this isn't the Four Seasons, but I've stayed at lots of hostels in North and South America, and the County Hotel beats them easily. There were indeed real showers, but who cares? If you go to ANY hotel in the US, even a nice one, you are going to end up standing in a tub. We also found the staff to be very friendly.Yes, the doors do seem to slam pretty loud, but you only hear your own neighbor's door. You should also hang out the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign before you go to bed, because the cleaning staff starts early. But these are just minor complaints, for the price and the location, the County Hotel cannot be beat."
35,665,Jun 1 2008 	Worst hotel experience ever........	HelloI wish to feedback to you my experience of staying at the County on May 30/31.I booked a twin rooom supposedly with a bath and English Breakfast. When I checked in I was told TOURICO HOLIDAYS -my booking agent - only provide Continental Breakfast. The receptionist said she would call TOURICO to confirm and get back to me to clarify which she never did.Our room did not have a bath or WC despite booking reference clearly stating it should have on the printout I gave to the receptionist.The public WC's were disgusting and were decorated with the contents of someone's poorly stomach.At breakfast the &quot;Restaurant Manager&quot; was very surly and unwelcoming. All he could say was &quot;Continental Breakfast&quot;. The toast had mould on it and the &quot;Chef&quot; had a stand up row with a waiter in front of all the customers.All in all a very poor experience. The staff were very and the receptionist showed a total lack of integrity.I felt embarassed on behalf of all the foreign visitors who will have received a negative impression of our fine capital city.Ben Ackroyd
36,665,"Apr 30 2008	County Hotel	The County Hotel was a big surprise as it is cheap for London, and the fact that all the bathrooms are shared. The staff were very pleasant and polite. The rooms were very clean,as was the bedding, I've been in dearer hotels that have not been as clean. The shared facilities were clean and the shower worked wonderfully well.We had booked a full breakfast and were very pleased. It was a buffet breakfast and you could help yourself to as much or as little as you wanted. It was all well cooked and very tastety.All in all a BIG thumbs up for The County Hotel. Just try and and ask for a room at the back if you don't like traffick noise!"
37,665,"Apr 13 2008 	Breakfast great but don't eat the rolls	The rooms are small but reasonably clean, but be aware that the road outside &quot;never sleeps&quot; so if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room at the back to aovid the traffic noise. The only disgruntlement I had was that a male guest chose to use the bathroom in the mornings without troubling to close the door first but that was a very minor complaint. I was quite impressed with the breakfast served despite being warned not to expect too much. I'd love to know what the building was used for prior to being a hotel - a nurse's halls of residence, perhaps? (My friend suggested a pyschiatric home!) You get what you pay for but if the hotel management/owners looked at the building's features/potential and restored it sympathetically, adding en suite rooms, they could command a much higher room rate than they currently do. Just my opinion though. Heigh-ho."
38,665,"Mar 31 2008	Filthy filthy filthy.	Imperial Hotels, the operators of the County, say that they have been providing accommodation since 1857. That was also probably the last time their property was thoroughly cleaned. In the course of a five-night stay I asked to be moved twice (the only time I have made such a request in more than a quarter-century of travel across all five continents) and can confirm that the rooms are uniformly squalid and unappealing. The leaking Victorian casement windows, most of which can't be fully closed, admit both wind and rain. Horizontal surfaces are covered with a millimetre-thick layer of black street dust. The carpets, I am given to understand, were laid in the 1970s. If you risk the breakfast, you are apt to find the debris of the previous day's meal adhering to the plates. Ironically, the communal bathrooms and showers are probably the cleanest parts of the house.The County is conveniently located--Euston Station is 150 m to the north--and, by London standards at any rate, economically priced. Those are, however, the only things that can be said in its favour."
39,665,Mar 29 2008	good value	my sister and i stayed at this hotel for two nights in march 2008. i wasnt expecting much having read the reviews and to be honest i think i got what i paid for. if i wanted more i would have paid more and stayed somewhere else. the bed was comfy and the breakfast was great. it does need work done to it but the staff were friendly and the room was clean. yes this place does need some love and attention given to it to restore it to a potentially great hotel but for what you pay it was fine. if all you require is a bed to sleep in at a cheap price then this is what you will get.
40,665,Mar 23 2008	wow what a hotel	I stayed in this hotel knowing that it was a budget hotel. At the time of booking this hotel i afterwards read other peoples comments and was very concerned but then i went with the attitude that i will not be spending alot of time in the room or hotel. Ok the room is dated and small but the staff are more than friendly and always there to help. The porters got used to me straight away and i did not even need to say my key number. The breakfast was excellent every morning. Who goes to london to stay in their room? I literally woke up in the morning showered eat my breakfast and left and came back at 11 oclock at night. Very centrally located for all places with the tube. Do not be put off by other peoples comments. If they want a better hotel they should go for a four star hotel. I was very concerned having no bathroom facilities in my room but i had no problems at all with the shared bathrooms. They were always clean with toilet paper and on the last morning by mistake i even found a shower cubicle on my floor. There are plenty of toilets and bathrooms on each floor. On only one occasion i met someone in the corridor in the morning. I would definetely recommend the hotel to anyone who would like to stay in central london. Always ask for a room on the back of the hotel as it is very quiet at night.Michelle Farrugia (Malta)
41,665,"Feb 4 2008 	Read This If You Are Staying At The County Hotel Euston	My friend and I were looking for a hotel which was close to Camden for a weekend of shopping and going out in the evenings. I stayed at this hotel from 1st - 3rd Feb 2008. If you are looking for relaxing romantic eveninigs soaking in a private bubble bath then this is not the hotel for you, but if you want somewhere cheap to leave your belongings, shower and sleep then this hotel is perfect. The staff on reception were effecient and check in was very simple. We obtained the key to the room form the porter and went up to an averaged sized twin room. On first glace it seems very sparse, but everything we needed was there. There was two quite comfy beds, each with fresh sheets and blankets and two pillows. There were extra blankets in the drawerss which we didn't use. At the front of the room was a sink and some little soaps, drawers, towels, a small kettle, tea and coffee and spoons etc, a TV and some leaflets about the area. The radiator was lovely and warm and the wardrobes has hangers in them. The room overlooked the main street and traffic could be heard whether the window was open or not - but it wasn't very loud and definately did not disturb me sleeping! The rooms were pretty clean - jut a little dust in some of the cracks and behind the radiator. The shower rooms were literally 3 steps away on the other side of the corridor and I didn't see another person use them the whoel time I was there despite the hotel being rather busy. They were sparse but the water was hot and they were kept clean. Between the four rooms at the end of our corridor was two showers and three loos, all lockable. Breakfast surprised me as I wasn't expecting much for 51 per night for two people! There was a huge selection of sausgaes, tomatoes, bacon, two types of egg, toast, rolls, butter, jams, marmalades, fruit, and lots of different cereral as well as fruit juices, teas and coffees. There were also alot of attentive members of staff at breakfast too. The key had to be left with reception whenever we left the hotel, but that was no problem. The porters were very effecient, even at 3am when we came in from a night out and asked him to point us in the nearest place that sold food! It took us eight minutes to walk back from Camden and about five minutes to get to Kings Cross - the location was brilliant, just accross the road from Euston tube/ train station and down the road from Euston Square staion. The hotel was generally very quiet despite it being quite full. I'd stay there again in a shot. It may not be luxury but it certainly was value for money."
42,665,"Jan 4 2008	DON`T GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!	The Hotel is a total disaster.. Nothing works, there are NO showers, you have to stand in a dirty bathtub, the people work there are totally unhelpful and a shame to the human race...Ill rather recommend bying a sleepingbag and sleep whit the bums in the parks..Im NOT kidding, dont [--] go to County Hotel, you will be dissapointed.."
43,665,"Nov 21 2007 	Great price....nasty hotel	I have stayed here twice. I will not make the same mistake again.This hotel has admittedly great prices. 41 for a single. But admittedly these prices are because the hotel hasn't been renovated since what seems like the 1960s and so it's a cash cow. The rooms are basic, which is fine, but they are also nasty - the TV is bolted to the desk, you can only switch it on from a separate light switch for some strange reason. There always seemed to be something broken - the first time I stayed, the phone did not work, and the bathroom light in the shared bathroom did not work. The second time, the bedlight in the room did not work, and the bathroom light again...It is REALLY hard to sleep well here. The windows are single glazed, and avoid the rooms on the main road like the plague, or the rush hour traffic at 6-7am will wake you up. Also, every door has a 'slam shut' function and the walls are really this, so every time someone leaves their room is like a bomb going off next to you.There are also no proper showers. You have to stand in a bath. The floors in the bathroom are rotting linoleum. The place is ludicrously overheated in the winter.The one positive thing about the hotel is breakfast....and price. If you can afford more, though, go somewhere else. I certainly will."
44,665,"Sep 22 2007	come on it's not that bad!!	For 41 a night, and being a 2-minute walk from Euston station, you simply are never going to do better than the County Hotel, unless you have a friend offering you free lodging! It's clean enough, well-guarded enough, the breakfast is not bad, rooms have TVs, the bath, toilet &amp; showers are clean. I frankly have no idea what these other people were expecting for this location at this price. The only complaint I have is that the walls are a bit thin, and because the rooms are close to each other, whenever anyone closes the bedroom or bathroom door, it is like a small crash in your room each time. But you get used to it. And while there may be a few dodgy characters about, it's nothing at all like the brothel or drug den that these earlier reviews suggest. I highly recommend it if you need to be in central London on a budget."
45,665,"Sep 4 2007 	Become a time-traveller!	My rating is based on expectations at this price. For 41 single or 53 double in an excellent location in central London, one doesn't expect much! It will just about get you a room in a very shabby B&amp;B. At the County, you are staying in a purpose built hotel albeit one which is nearly 70 years old and which, apart from an occasional lick of paint, seems to have been undisturbed since. The experience is a bit like going through a time warp. The rooms are small clean but not en-suite. However, I never had to wait to get access to a bathroom. The plumbing was old-fashioned but the showers were powerful. The signs around the hotel seemed to be 1930s originals. The bar offers a glimpse London pubs as they used to be. Even the bar prices seemed several years out of date!Breakfast was traditional and substantial. Porters, receptionists and bar staff were polite and helpful.OK the place is in urgent need of refurbishment but, if you know of anywhere else in central London in this price-range whose directory of room services still includes (at extra charge) breakfast room service, babysitting and the internal extension of the hotel florist, I'd love to hear about it.If the Imperial chain ever decided to spend a bit on restoration they could probably re-package the County as a &quot;retro-experience&quot; and double its rates!"
46,665,Aug 15 2007 	Terrible - Stay somewhere else!	This is the worst place I have ever stayed in! And that is comparing it to hostels as well as hotels. To be fair you cant expect too much for the price of this hotel but I was hoping it would at least be clean and hospitable.The staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. When checking in we were basically told that the receptionist had better things to be doing and to hurry up. The shared bathrooms were dirty and it was expected that we use the towels already in the communal areas so had not been supplied with personal ones. Breakfast was awful with stale bread and gone off milk.I have stayed in other hotels in the Imperial chain before and have never had any problems so I was surprised at how bad the service was here.If you need a cheap place to stay in London I would advise staying in a hostel over this hotel or finding another similarly priced hotel. It was if they were trying their hardest to make this the most unpleasant experience possible.
47,665,"Aug 15 2007 	AWFUL	This hotel was truly terrible. When we booked we realised it was a budget hotel and as we are two experienced travellers perfectly used to hostels we were expecting cheap and cheerful but nothing more. Firstly, when we arrived I said my name the receptionist who proceded to fling a yellow form at me and actually threw a biro! When I was filling in the form as fast as I could (taking roughly 60 seconds in total!) the receptionist was tapping her nails on the table ushering me along and then actually said &quot;I do have other things to do you know&quot;. My friend and I couldn't actually believe it. The porters were inoffensive in general although I certainly wouldn't call them friendly! The maid woke us up at 8:30 which seemed badly organised as we were only staying for one night and didn't need to checkout before 11, after which you would expect the maid to clean the room. The bathrooms were grimy and the hot tap became too hot to turn off after a shower scalding my hand! There were no bath towels provided in the room, just a couple of hand towels by the basin. Those provided in the bathroom we obviously didn't want to use as you can't be sure how clean they are being that the bathrooms are shared. When my friends came into the foyer after walking me back, their first words were &quot;it smells in here&quot;. After all this we weren't expecting much of a breakfast but thought there might be something edible, how wrong we were! The cooked breakfast looked worse than school dinners, the bread rolls were rock hard and stale, and the milk was off. There were more waiting staff than diners so they were fussing around us seemingly with no purpose, my friend described them as &quot;zombies&quot; which I think summed them up well. Frankly it was a horrid experience and I would never return!"
48,665,"May 25 2007 	Nice Hotel	I have just returned to Manchester UK after staying for 4 nights at the County Hotel London. My room was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful. Yes this hotel is budget and that is how people should treat it. For the rates that the hotel charge, one is never going to get the same facilities as a top class hotel. All I want is somewhere to sleep in a nice clean room with nice clean bedding. Which is what I had at the County Hotel. The hotel is situated near Euston Station. There is a bus stop outside the hotel, a tube station at Russell Square which is around a 5 minute walk, about the same time as the walk from Euston Station.I have stayed at the County hotel once before and was pleased with it, I have already booked for the 10th of December 2007Kathybell25/05/2007"
49,665,"May 18 2007	Depressing and horrible	Fair enough, it's a cheap hotel in London, so I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, but this place is horrible! I've stayed in similarly priced places in London with better locations, and none of them have been anything like this.The staff at reception were rude and looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but there. The whole place just had this incredibly depressing vibe about it. My room was not particularly clean, and just plain ugly. The whole place needs to be renovated, badly. Nothing - furniture, curtains, blankets - seems like it's been updated or replaced (or in some cases even cleaned) for a good 40 years. The noise from the street was so horrendous it stopped me from sleeping The shared bathrooms were also an issue, being not terribly clean either and hard to access when needed with all the other people using them.Do yourself a favour, do not stay at this hotel."
50,665,"May 10 2007 	cheap and cheerful!!!	i've just discovered this hotel after staying at the regents palace aka flea pit!!! for a few years . the county is half the price of what i paid at the flea pit and that place sometimes was minging! as a regular theatre goer sometimes i want to go to the evening shows i can't unless i stop overnight in london due to me living in the midlands and no trains back.this hotel is great for me as it's a short walk from euston,and not far to the west end with great tube,bus links if i can't be bothered to walk.yeah the hotel is old fashioned,scruffy and there's no en suite but it's cheap safe and warm which will do for me. plus the brekkie is amazing after a brekkie in the hotel i very rarley eat till late at night,i've three more stays booked in the hotel so far tjhis year and there probaly be more. the only thing i'm not keen on about this hotel is the keys i'd prefer a key card but it's not a problem.plus last year when i stayed for a few days i had a clean towel and a new small bar of soap every day.i book this hotel through a british travel agency/company and it's even better value and cheaper than booking through the hotel it's self"
51,665,"May 1 2007 	Where to begin!	Things started badly during our stay at the County Hotel, with one of our parties booking having been &quot;lost&quot;. I fail to understand how this can happen, but that's what we were told. After finally being allocated rooms, we eagerly anticipated a good kip after a long day on a course.The lift, in hindsight, was the best thing about the hotel, as it actually worked.The room was large enough to stick a single bed in, with a vanity unit at the end. I would hazard a guess that the Malboro cowboy had stayed in the room before me, as it stunk like someone had smoke 24-7 in there for the past 3 years. This was somewhat strange, as there was a 2 inch gap between the top of the sash window and the frame, which provided ventilation, whether you liked it or not.My colleague then knocked on my door after seeing his room, and to quote &quot;I didn't realise places like this still existed in England&quot;. I had a terrible nights sleep as the hotel is located right next door to an ambulance depot, and is on one of the main roads running through Bloomsbury. The window problem clearly accentuated the noise penetration.It is worth noting that one toilet is shared between about 8 bedrooms, so if you need the loo, it can be a frustrating time. For the blokes out there, the sink in the room is just about reachable.The breakfast was administered by a guy who looked suspiciously like Pol Pot, and ruled over the breakfast room with a similar attitude to his doppleganger. The breakfast was passable, if you like cold toast and unsually chewy sausages. Even though this hotel is cheap, you can find better alternatives at a similar price. How this place passes health and safety each year I do not know!"
52,665,"Apr 16 2007 	The most 70's Hotel around!	The breakfast here is great, but aside that the rest of the hotel is a bit of a let down.I cant describe how 70s this place is, orange wool bedcovers, orange curtains, dark brown and orange carpets in the corridors etc, it was like being in Life On Mars or Rising Damp or something.We asked for a double, which was 2 single beds pushed together, which split apart and I fell down the middle just as the maid walked in, without knocking, which I found rude. We werent given a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign or anything. Anyway, what she walked in on, made her leave quickly, bwahahaha!The hotel itself as a whole really isnt too bad. Its good value, but if they just put some new carpet down, got some new curtains, beddingand furniture, maybe threw in a few double beds or king size beds, and it'd be superb.If I was really lost for choice, I'd stay there again without too much protest."
53,665,"Apr 14 2007 	decent budget choice	The County is the budget choice in the Imperial line, which has other properties along Upper Woburn. We stayed there 3 nights in a small triple with our daughter. We selected the County because of price ($71 pounds with English breakfast buffet) and location near Euston and the British Museum. The other guests were families with children, retired couples, and solo. The staff was friendly, cleaning services were prompt, and the breakfast was quite good (tea, coffee, juices, milk, cereals, fruit, rolls, toast, jams, eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, tomatoes). There is a bus stop outside the front door and a small bar in the hotel serving drafts and 3 cask ales at good prices. Food is also available for order from the bar."
54,665,"Dec 3 2006 	Good budget hotel	Stayed in this hotel for one night. We picked it basically because it was reasonable priced and was near Euston station were we were getting off train. The hotel is reasonably priced the facilities were basic but good there was a tv and tea and coffee making facilities in all the rooms. There were satety deposit boxes at reception. Staff were very friendly and you got a buffet hot breakfast consisting of bacon, sausage, egg etc. Continental breakfast was also available."
55,665,"Nov 4 2006	Sleepless Nights!	We stayed at this hotel for three nights on our honeymoon. What a mistake. I wanted to checkout the minute we went to our room. It was like a hospital room, infact i am convienced it was a mental institution or hospital some time ago. Shared bathrooms and toliets were horrible like everything else in the hotel, I felt like I was on school camp again. The bed was terrible. We rolled into the middle and could actually see the sprngs sticking out of the mattress. I actually thought the floor was more comfortable. It was close to the train and Eurostar on a positive note. We stayed out each day as long as we could so we didnt have to go back . You get what you pay for.... not very much.!I would never stay there again."
56,665,"Nov 3 2006 	Perfactly Acceptable	I've given this hotel a 4star rating not because it compares with the Hilton or even its other Imperial counterparts (its part of the Imperial chain), but because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than a cheap and cheerful hotel.I chose to stay at the County because prior to that I was staying in what was considered to be a long stay hotel (AKA a bedsit) which was truely aweful - everything about the place was foul.The staff are friendly at the County, the 40 a night includes a lovely English breakfast. The rooms are clean - but old fashioned. Equipped with TV and tea makers.The bathrooms are shared, but I can assure readers that they are clean - they are apparently cleaned every 3 hours. There's no grout, or filthy shower curtains and the showers are hot and very powerful.I've had my fair share of NASTY hotels, but the County Hotel certainly exceeded my expectations - great for those with a small budget. Would I return - yes absolutley if I were on a budget."
57,665,"Sep 19 2006 	For impecunious scholars only	If you go, make sure that you ask for a room at the back. The street in front is one of the busiest in London, with cars, taxis, coaches, buses and lorries fiercely rushing past all night. Even with the window closed, the constant noise makes it impossible to sleep.Otherwise, it is a great location for work at the British Library, with easy access from the Euston, Kings Cross and St Pancras railway stations. Until the Eurostar reaches St Pancras (2007), the hotel is in fact conveniently located for the Eurostar in Waterloo, as a No 68 or 168 bus drops you right in front of the hotel.So what you pay for is location. The rest is bad or indifferent. If you come to London to see the sights in the West End, you will find far better en-suite bargains in Bayswater if you shop around. The 40 rack rate (single, incl. English breakfast) is not negotiable and no agencies will offer a lower tariff on the Internet.The big, silent breakfast room will remind you of a monastery, just like your tiny room  and indeed the hotel is only really suitable for scholars who have work to do in the British Library or the University of London."
58,665,"May 30 2006	Very basic hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights 27th May 2006.The hotel is in a great location with easy access to tube lines from Euston, Euston square or Russell square.The rooms are basic with a comfortable bed, sink and television with a variety of channels. Although the bed sheets were clean, the cleaning of the rest of the room was not up to scratch. When we arrived there was a dead insect next to the sink and a ciggarette butt on the floor and they remained there until we left 2 days later.The rooms are not en-suite and you share a bathroom with 6 other rooms. This is an inconvenience however I was aware of this when we booked it. The toilets do not have sinks so you have to go back to the room before you can wash your hands.The reception staff were very friendly and allowed us to have an early check-in at 9.30am.The porters were rude and unhelpful. Coming back to the hotel two nights in a row we caught them sat around having a beer in reception. We were even charged 50 pence for leaving our bags with them for a couple of hours after we checked out.The decor is old fashioned and looks run-down. The public areas are dull and are badly in need of bringing up-to-date and restoring. On a positive note there was a lovely cooked breakfast which set us up for a days sightseeing. The hotel was cheap at 52 per night and it served a purpose as a base for sightseeing and somewhere to sleep. Other than that it was one of the worse hotels I have stayed in, although it did not spoil my trip to London. I would reccomend it to the budget traveller who is after no frills."
59,665,"Apr 24 2006	edwardian splendor at the county	we stayed at the county for a week last year when visiting london for the lord mayors show and although it does not have en- suite facilities the staff are very friendly and the food is good. the dinner at night is very plain -fare but the money you pay you cant buy a coffee anywhere in london for. we paid just under 4.00 for our dinners which were chops with onions, cottage pie etc. but if you go to anywhere in london central you pay that for a coffee. we are going back at least once this year.the decor is edwardian and very art deco in places especially the bathtubs but although the baths are not en-suite there are a few on every floor so you dont have to wait or queue for a bath or shower. although edwardian in places the hotel rooms and everywhere i went in the hotel was spotless i would recomend this hotel for anyone on a budget who wants value for money. after all the only time you are back at your roomm is to change for the night out or to sleep."
60,665,Apr 4 2006 	Clean cheap generally quiet and well placed	If you consider how much you pay for this hotel I think it is great. The only thing that may put people off isthe factthat the bathroom and toilet is shared along the corridor for ALL rooms. I also did not like the factthat the only light is a flourescent tube light.I have been back here three times so far for one night stays by myself when workign in London and I will go back again.
61,665,"Sep 7 2005 	truthful review	Very basic,it is stated as a two star hotel but one star would be more in line.It is as if it has stayed untouched for about 40 years,very rowdy guests in my area,kept clean but some guests tried to flood the place leaving baths/showers running.Breakfast was very good,staff very untalkative,not many spoke good English but for a basic hotel can't complain at the price,central and next to good transport links.Hey,you only get what you pay for and as i didn't pay much it was a bargain."

12,669,Mar 25 2004	Caring and helpful staff	Just returned from 6 nights in London. The Craven Gardens Hotel staff were most helpful and caring. We had access to their freezer for medication. They wanted to be sure our needs were met. The rooms and full English breakfsts were quite adequate. The proximitely to the underground made our comings and goings very easy. The friendliness of the staff started our day just right.

15,669,Dec 2 2003	NOT SO HOT!	Just got back form a 5-night stay at this hotel. It was a little tacky. The picture of the bar shown on the internet site was obviously taken several years ago - not all the bright blue upholstry is faded and stained. The twin room we had was tiny tiny tiny -- ( you had to sit on the bed to open the closet door	
16,669,Nov 20 2003	Just okay	Hardly a 3 star hotel. i would say an average 2 star at the best. No peeling paint
17,669,Sep 17 2002	Perfect 3-Star	Craven Gardens Hotel is a nice 3-star property with easy access to the underground and buses. Kensington Gardens is only a block away and across the street from the hotel are a couple of convienience stores for snacks

2,672,Jul 13 2009 	Give it a chance	We stayed for one night at the Cricklewood Hotel. It was pretty poor from the parking point of view with a very small car park for a thirty roomed hotel. On arrival the reception were very helpful
3,672,Dec 8 2008 	Terrible avoid at all costs!	I booked a room in the Cricklewood Lodge for a friend who was staying in London for a few days. I went to pick up the keys for him and was greeted by an incredibly rude man in the reception
4,672,Jul 27 2008 	awful time at the Cricklewood	Theres nothing good to say about this hotel. It is in desperate need of renovation (it looks nothing like the pictures on the website). Our room (8) was dirty and shabby. The furniture was a mix of rickety old tables and a dirty desk. The tv didnt work properly and there was no remote control. The over bed light was a rusty desk lamp screwed to the wall. The sink in the bedroom was dirty and rusty and covered in fag burns. Our double bed was awful due to the fact it was made up of 2 doors which nicely stuck out from under the mattress! Now for the best bit
5,672,May 28 2008 	nice hotel	I have recently stayed at this hotel
6,672,Apr 21 2008 	Avoid this hotel at all cost	We visited London for 3 days to see my son before moving on to Paris. He found this &quot;little gem&quot; for us and I guess being a backbacker
7,672,Jan 3 2008 	The worst hotel in London	We booked an overnight stay at this hotel because it was near the area we had some business the following day. Upon entering the hotel we noticed how grubby and worn it all looked. We were given the key to our room and found it to be filthy dirty with a broken toilet seat down the side of the toilet with thick dirt all around. I knew I could not stay there. We complained to the manager and he said they did not have any more rooms available. My husband left the hotel to try and book us in elsewhere without success. It seamed we had no choice so reluctantly stayed. During the night my husband was woken by bed bugs crawling over his body but knew if he woke me up I would have been devastated. In the morning I saw the bites on my husbands body. Totally disgusted I left without breakfast knowing we had payed by credit card and could do very little about it. Please do not repeat the shockingly awful experience we had.	
1,674,Nov 22 2009 	Amazing place to stay.	I love this hotel so much. I have stayed at this hotel before and I have nothing but brilliant experiences.The hotel is very very clean
2,674,Oct 18 2009 	Great Hotel Great location Great stay!!!	I had an excelent experience at this hotel. Before i went
3,674,Sep 25 2009 	Bad Service took 2 hrs extra to check in clean rooms.	This has got to be one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. We first arrived from a 12 hr flight to the hotel @ 3:30pm
4,674,Sep 24 2009 	Great Hotel Superb facilities worth a visit if your in the area	We stayed at this hotel as part of a group
5,674,Sep 21 2009 	Lovely hotel but wish it was closer to Wembley Stadium	Myself and my husband stayed for one night as we were going to a concert at Wembley Stadium. Upon arrival check in was fast and the staff member on reception was very friendly and informative. The room was gorgeous (as is the whole of the hotel
6,674,Aug 25 2009 	Excellent hotel refurbished clean and handy for underground	We booked this hotel for one night so that we could drive to it from Hampshire and use it as a base to visit Kew Gardens. It has parking facilities at a reasonable price. Hangar Road underground station is across the road so it is also very handy for trains to the centre of London and the huge shopping mall at Shepherds Bush.The hotel has recently been re-furbished and I believe upgraded form 4 to 4.5 stars. The rooms were spotlessly clean with a large comfortable bed and tea/coffee making facilities.The staff in reception were friendly
7,674,Aug 22 2009 	we get bargain	We booked the room while promotion
8,674,Aug 16 2009 	Good for Wembley - easy for central London.	My wife and I stayed here to go to the U2 concert at Wembley Stadium and this was one of the first hotels that popped up from Google in terms of location - we were really pleased with the hotel.We arrived at midday not expecting to check in
9,674,Aug 4 2009 	okay yet not good enough to be a crowne plaza	This hotel is quite a way out of London on the central line west ruislip branch
10,674,Jul 7 2009 	Good Hotel for Wembley (If No 83 bus is running!!!)	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza when going to a Take That concert at Wembley Stadium.We found the hotel really easily on the Hanger Lane gyratory (be careful you don't miss the entrance
11,674,Jun 6 2009 	An Excellent hotel just outside of London	Got fed up staying in hotels in London that offerred a poor level of service so choose this hotel on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. The hotel accommodation was modern and comfortable
12,674,"May 29 2009 	Stay away from this ""so called"" 4 Star Hotel	This must be the worst 4 Star Hotel in the UK. This Hotel is run on so short staff"
13,674,May 25 2009 	Great Hotel - a bit far out of town - but would def stay again	The hotel was superb. Very modern. Great service from the reception staff.It was ideally suited to underground users - with a tube station across the road.We got a taxi from Mayfair back to the hotel one night at a cost of about £50 so would not recommend for people who like to use taxis. But this was our only niggle (not a complaint) about the hotel overall.We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. Great value at around £70 per night &amp; parking was very realsonable (for London) at £20 per day.	
14,674,May 3 2009	Crowne Plaza Hotel Ealing London	We have stayed her frequently over the past 8 yrs and had some good experiences and some bad! Stayed again this May Bank Holiday weekend and was pleasantly surprised to find
15,674,Mar 5 2009 	Good sized rooms but very expensive internet access	For a London hotel and considering the rates charged at weekends
16,674,Feb 16 2009 	One more glowing review	There is not much more to say than this hotel deserves a round of applause. For a city 4 star it has really pulled out the stops to provide those little extras that made a stay more comfortable.We arrived at 10.00 am and were immediately checked into our room. Paying £10 for parking was excellent value and we were allowed to stay until 5 pm the following day. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms have iron and board
17,674,Jan 22 2009 	Faultless	Best value for money ( I did stay at the weekend on £65 b&amp;b for two per night ). Rooms 
18,674,Nov 21 2008 	Refurbishment Transformation	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Ealing 18 times between March and August 2008 whilst my employer was relocating an office
19,674,Nov 18 2008 	Good Value	Spent weekend in London at the Crown Plaza Ealing. Very good updating done. Modern comfortable rooms and public areas. Very high standard in the furnishings. Bar is very nice and the restaurant is good. Best part about this hotel is that it is directly across the street from the Hanger Lane Tube stop on the Central Line in zone three. A short trip the the City. A few local restuarants within walking distance. Weekend rates were 60 pounds VAT included. They booked a car for transport to Heathrow and it worked like a charm--only took 35 minutes to the airport. Reception staff was friendly and helpful	
20,674,Sep 21 2008 	Brand new and it shows	There isn't much to pick out about the Crowne Plaza Ealing.It's been well refurbished and is spotlessly clean - the fixtures and fittings are of a high standard
21,674,Sep 21 2008 	Excellent Refurbishment	I needed to be in Central London early Sunday Morning but as it was a Bank Holiday weekend the UK rail system had decided to shutdown so I could not get in before 11am without a 2 hour delay on a 1 hour journey. I looked at the HI site for a cheap hotel and the best value was the CP Ealing which I had staid at before for 1 night so I knew it was right next door to the tube and only 30 mins from central london. I was hoping to take advantage of a day in central london but did not feel 100% so checked in at 2.30 for a break. The room was excellent (upgraded as PC platinum) - no view from the room but this is ealing not central london. Nice size
22,674,Sep 20 2008	great place to stay in london	the hotel has been refurbished and the rooms are very quiet and fresh and spacious. the staff are all friendly and efficient and the gym is tops. we did b&amp;b and the full english breakfast was excellent and well prepared by the brilliant chef &quot;ali&quot; who was always ready to help and would serve us right to the table! we could tell that the team was a happy one and ably led by the very personable &quot;pedro&quot; who was friendly and humerous and very attentive to detail. my wife and i would definately return to the crowne if given the opportunity. well done crowne plaza
23,674,Sep 4 2008 	Crowne Plaza Review	Very good hotel with excellent and helpful staff. The refurbishment has improved it drastically and the staff are obviously enjoying working in their new environment as they couldn't do enough for you.Nice restaurant and bar in the basement - only negative would be that there isn't really anything decent nearby so you are forced into eating at the hotel which isn't a bad thing!! but just in case you wanted to try anything different to the usual hotel food.Would definately stay again.	
24,674,Jun 26 2008 	Looking promising when renovations done	Changed to here after a bad stay at the Ramada Ealing. This was a much better experience! They are at the tail end of a huge renovation project
25,674,Jun 8 2008 	Pricey but delivered good value - handy(ish) for Wembley	Stayed here for the Foo Fighters concert at Wembley
26,674,Jun 8 2008	Refurbished and looking cute!	Hotel is currently undergoing a multi million pound refurb
27,674,Mar 28 2008	Nice renovations	I stayed in this hotel for a business trip recently
28,674,Mar 9 2008 	Fine for a business trip - no problems at all	The hotel has a good location just off Hangar Lane. I was staying on business - bedroom was nice and clean as well as being quiet. The bar was busy and was fine for bar snacks and a quick drink before heading back to work. Overall I would stay again.	
29,674,Jan 23 2008 	Nice Renovations	Stayed last night in a renovated room. Very impressed by the renovation
30,674,Oct 5 2007	To Far to Central London	I picked this hotel for two reasons: 1) is was cheap 2) I travelled with two other friends and we wanted to stay in the same room
31,674,Oct 4 2007 	Looking Tired	Stayed for one night. charged £150 for room only
32,674,Jul 9 2007 	Don't take your car....	We stayed here as it was close to Wembley and we were attending the Concert for Diana
33,674,Jul 4 2007 	Very Poor	I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last few years and each time I stay it gets worse.This time on checking
34,674,Apr 27 2007 	Good value friendly 	My husband &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on the London Marathon weekend. We booked on a bed &amp; breakfast plus dinner on the first night deal for £129.00 total. We were given a choice of dining on either night
35,674,Apr 3 2007 	Very convenient location - recommended.	This hotel is ideal if you're coming into London on the (M40/A40) as it's just off the main road (quiet in the rooms though due to triple glazing). It's also ideal for parking the car (£6.95 per day) and then getting the tube (Hangar Lane) into central London (£7.40 for zone 1-3 all day ticket).The room itself was fine - clean with good quality bedding/towels. Spacious bathroom.The bar was on a lower level and seemed ok for a couple of pints
36,674,"Feb 25 2007	""Dinner Experience"" Good Value	This Hotel is situated conveniently just a few minutes walk from Hanger Lane Tube Station which takes you straight into London West End on the Central Line in about 25 minutes without changing. We booked a &quot;Dinner Experience&quot; 2 night stay through the Hotel website what seemed extremely good value at £64.50 per night for London and included a 3 course dinner on one night and english breakfast. Kids under 11 eat free. The dinner in the Sunflower Restaurant was a rather bland affair. Its rather souless in the lower ground floor and lacks atmosphere. There was a choice at dinner but this was rather limited and I would rate the meal as average but it filled the &quot;gap&quot; so to speak. The buffet breakfast was reasonable and offered a choice of fresh fruit and some continental dishes. The restaurant staff are rather attentative but lacked the personal touch.Parts of the hotel is looking dated and could do with a refurbishment now. The Lobby and Reception staff are decent and helpful during our stay. Our room was clean "
37,674,Jan 8 2007 	Not bad at all	We stayed here for one night because we were going to Wembley Arena. The hotel is 2mins away from a bus-stop which takes you straight there in about 20mins (Bus stop A
38,674,Apr 15 2005 	Good enough	Good sized-room
39,674,Oct 4 2004	Not real luxury but...	Stayed here a couple of times.Not exactly real luxury but if you book in advance on the net (Advance Purchase) saves you lots of money.Very handy hotel for central London and for driving into London.Cleanliness is average both times I was there but you can't complain for the money you pay.Nearest tube - Hanger Lane (2 mins)	
40,674,Jul 7 2004	Really nice!	A really nice hotel not far from the city centre. Only stayed one night
41,674,Jul 26 2009 	Rénovation de qualité !		
42,674,Apr 5 2009	Sauberes neu renoviertes Hotel im Großraum London		
1,678,Nov 22 2009 	Great service and a great location	My wife and I enjoyed our stay last june great service close to all attractions
2,678,"Nov 22 2009 	Luxury with goo vibrations!	Beautiful hotel , helpful , smiley staff, but english breakfast awful and overpriced. Tinned mushrooms, scrambled eggs (powdered?) . Come on Crowne Plaza 5 stars? 7th Floor room every 15mins vibration runs through wall structure as District/Central line tube passes under the Hotel? No double glazing in room?"
3,678,"Nov 22 2009 	Great location poor hotel	The location is great. Service is very varying, and often very bad. E mails sent to the hotel are not replied. Several telephone calls were needed. Beware of room 155. Completely dark, view on very ugly wall only and very noisy (the hotel's air refreshing system is just below). In fact, this is a room that should be used for storage, but not for guest accomodation. After request, I got another room which was much better. Bathrooms are not nice. Corridors are narrow. Service very varying, check in was very inefficient. There are queues at the breakfast room. This hotel is not up to standard in general."
4,678,"Nov 21 2009 	Excellent Location Nice Plush Lobby Average Rooms	The location is second to none. The lobby and restaurants are great, especially the Michelin star Indian restaurant. But the rooms are somewhat dated. In fact the chairs were wobbly with weak legs.Overall OK"
5,678,"Nov 9 2009 	Great location not as nice as the modern Crowne Plaza City Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for one night. The location is excellent within easy walking distance of the St James Park tube station and minutes from excellent bus connections. The main entrance is very grand but the rooms do not come up to the entrance standard. The shower in our room was awful with next to no pressure and the bathroom dcor was terrible. We had an internal facing room with a very ugly view. We were disappointed with our room.The concierge was excellent, he was so helpful and accommodating, he made our stay a very pleasant one and made us feel like valued guests. I found the breakfast host rude and we were not asked if we would like toast, which I we have been offered in other hotels of this brand.I would recommend the Crowne Plaza City hotel above this one. The city hotel is very modern and is also in an excellent location."
6,678,"Nov 1 2009 	Very Nice Hotel.	Very Nice Hotel, traditional classic decor, very friendly staff &amp; attentive to our needs. We were upgraded to a superior deluxe room which was very nice &amp; spacious."
7,678,"Oct 27 2009 	Great Location	The Crowne Plaza St. James is in an excellent location for sightseeing. It is two blocks from Buckingham Palace and about 1/2 mile walk from Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and Royal Horseguards, and about the same distance from Victoria Station in the other direction. There are several theaters near Victoria (we saw &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Victoria Apollo. There are plenty of eating establishments within walking distance of the hotel althought most of them are pubs. The underground is also a short walk from the hotel. The room we were given was a nice big corner room. It was big by European standards. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Our rate included the breakfast buffet which was very nice. We didn't use the hotel restaurant for any other meals. The hotel was exceptionally clean and seemed to be well-maintained. The only problem we had was checking in. One clerk said our room wouldn't be ready for hours and when we spoke with a different clerk we had our room in less than an hour. So we were in our room within two hours of arrival. We had arrived at 9:00 am."
8,678,"Oct 24 2009 	Still marvelous after all these years	Okay, so it hasn't been sooo many years since I stayed here last (and wrote reviews), from June 2008 to October 2009. But, I am very pleased to see the level of consistency that I did - everything the same if not better (other than the prices, which have gone up and if you are American... sorry).Lobby/reception/check-in - The check-in process was super easy and very nice. The counter staff was completely knowledgable and made things easy. There was a trainee there - can't remember his name, but he was sooo nice, tall, dark blond hair and grey suit, he was there every single time I went to the counter - morning, late at night, you name it! He went above and beyond. I had two nights there but did them as separate bookings (different nights had different low cost availability and I was on per diem), but he made it easy. The lobby is really great. Last time and this time, it's a scene in and of itself. Normally I was just there to meet other people and go out, but when I was the first one there and had to wait, it was an enjoyable scene - sometimes the game is on and there's a crowd following that, other times there's a live pianist which is an exceptional treat and makes the ambiance really very nice. I have to say I really like the lobby, very comfortable just to hang out there.Restaurants/bar - I didn't eat meals other than breakfast, but the breakfast is really nice. You can have juice, milk, tea, coffee. They'll ask if you want toast, even (but, if you want it nice and dark you have to tell them to double toast it). There's eggs, juice, cheese, cereal, fruit, croissants, etc. and while it's busy in there for breakfast, it doesn't feel crowded. The bar is fantastic, albeit really pricey. It has that dark paneled clubby feel to it without feeling pretentious or putting on airs, so you actually feel like you belong. Actually metaphor for the hotel overall. In summer we sat outside and it was very nice - there were still outside places to sit, we were fascinated to see, and they are heated with those heat lamps - but we sat inside as we thought it was still too cold to be outside even with the lamps. The service was fabulous and they have this Tobler-tini that one of the wait staff recommended that was out of this world. In fact, they do these really neat drinks, like saffron-infused gin, vanilla-infused vodka, etc. that they do right there in the hotel, that's worth it right there. It's worth it, and maybe a good way to convince yourself that the drinks that are about 10 quid are really not so expensive if you don't convert it to dollars! They also put out really good nuts - smoked almonds and cashews - with the drinks.Concierge - I don't usually review concierges (or stay in places with them!), but this one I feel goes beyond and is therefore worth singling out for praise. They are great at helping decipher which shows have which days and times open and where they are, they will hold tickets until about 4 or 5 if you think you might want to see a show but aren't sure if you'll make it, and they will answer all kinds of questions cheerfully and without any expectation. They even recommended the different restaurants to me including the Nando's! (As there is a hotel restaurant, I was pleased that they didn't try to steer me that way.) Also, when I needed to leave very early for a flight and asked for a taxi for the very early morning, they got me a private car (not a black cab) that was actually cheaper than the taxi would have been, but called me in my room to ask me whether I would be okay with that arrangement before they committed to it. They are great for advice on anything and everything London, and have great personalities!Hotel overall, amenities and rooms - Someone criticized the narrow corridors and wind-ey pathways to the rooms. I didn't think this was an issue, although it is true. But that's because it's such an historic building and they kept the bones and didn't tear it all down and begin afresh. Last time I was more toward the back of the hotel and had what I would consider a standard room, this time I was in the front of the hotel and it felt like a suite, with a hallway and everything. It was huge! The bed and pillows - very comfortable. TV had lots of channels. The bathroom was large, with a towel warmer. There was a safe in the room which is my favorite amenity... and there was an iron and board right in there too, which is wonderful - half the time in hotels you have to beg for one and then wait for hours because the hotel has just one! There was a pants press too, in the closet, but even though I could turn it on I couldn't figure out how to make it actually work. There's a minibar with fridge, it's the kind I could put my own things in the fridge to keep them cool, too, without incurring charges. the bathroom has a towel warmer, but the pressure from the shower isn't the greatest. But it was always hot and the towels are nice sized - real bath towels, not some little thing! There's a good workout room in the basement - you have to go out and through the courtyard to a rear building where the spa also is - it's a nice sized gym with modern machines for weights as well as cardio. There's an elevator in the back of the building as well as two main ones just off the lobby and I never found myself waiting more than 15 or 20 seconds for one. My one big gripe was that they charge for internet access. In a time when you get free wifi in American highway motels and African one-star hotels, with the prices you pay for this place and the overall lavish atmosphere it has and wants to perpetuate - they shouldn't be charging for internet access.Location - I very much like this location. It's very near to Victoria Station, where both Wicked and Billy Elliott are playing. It's close the other way to Westminster Abbey, the London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. It's near to all kinds of shops and restaurants - in particular, there is a Nando's right nearby as well as any number of pubs, a pizza place, a bar and grille, and a couple of other places. There's 2 Boots pharmacies, at least 2 Starbucks, a Marks and Spencer and a Sainsbury. It was perfect for me and where I needed to be."
9,678,"Oct 24 2009 	The staff are the winning team	This is not a typical Crowne Plaza. It is actually Taj owned under the CP banner so you get an unusual mix. The location is excellent, the lobby is marvellous and the top grade rooms not bad. But the corridors are shabby - the carpets have been replaced but not the wallpaper or paint re-done. Investment has gone into touch entry cards on doors but not into bathrooms. A strange choice of priorities is evident. Always have breakfast in your room. The small restaurant just cannot cope and the queue can snake out into the lobby.BUT, but, but - stay here because of the staff. They are, almost without exception, universally efficient, polite, charming and exemplary. And the staff are the beating heart of any hotel."
10,678,"Oct 7 2009	couldn't have asked for better!	Had recent 2 night stay here, with 3 generations of family, some travelling from abroad. Concierge was very helpful in sorting out car parking in the streets around the hotel.It was &quot;free&quot; as at a weekend but the doorman kept an eye on it whilst we waited for the free period to begin,some hours after we arrived.We were also able to have breakfast all together in a lovely quiet room on the first floor;a tranquil start to the day. Unfortunately one family member was taken unwell in the early hours, needing a short visit to hospital for tests and the duty manager was most helpful and considerate and made a difficult and stressful time a little easier. Couldn't have asked for more!"
11,678,Oct 6 2009 	Great location and Excellent service	My wife and I stayed here for three nights before a cruise. I used points for this stay. When we arrived the room was not ready so we walked around. There are so many attractions within walking distance that it was several hours before we returned.The room was small but certainly adequate and very clean. The bed was comfortable. We had tickets to a play one night and the hotel restaurant had an excellent three course pre-theater dinner for 24 pounds. The staff was very helpful in making our stay very enjoyable. There is a nice pub down at the corner for breakfast or a snack. We were close to Victoria Station and I would say this is an excellent location to see London.
12,678,"Sep 22 2009 	Good Location...Yet a bit olde world and terrible bathrooms	Positives...Good location for getting to the poosh parts of London, and the main tourist areas/Good breakfast, yet beware of a wait on the weekends/staff were helpfull in most areasNegatives....This is olde world tradittional hotel, and getting to your room isn't easy, as each floor is big and full of nooks and crannys/ the bathrooms are really, really tired and don't fit with the brand and certainly arent 4 star. Internet was very very poor, considering you had to pay!"
13,678,"Sep 21 2009 	Get the bathrooms sorted!	We stayed in this hotel for two nights as it was near to the Billy Elliot theatre. We had to ask to move room as the bath was chipped and marked. The second room we were shown was the same but third time lucky!! Our clothes were lost in the transfer and only turned up the next day after frequent phone calls, resulting in us having to complain formally. The food and position of the hotel were good but be prepared to stand in a queue for breakfast. The Bistro is far too small to ccomodate the number of guests in the hotel. Room was clean and well maintained but bathrooms are not up to scratch for a 4* hotel."
14,678,"Sep 19 2009 	great location rooms a bit tired	This really is a great location for visiting London, ok for value, probably the top end of what you would want to pay, and the rooms are looking tired and could do with a spruce, but in general the hotel is very quiet, and the staff are very friendly, and even though it is quite posh, you don't feel out of place.It is our second visit and we would return if we were staying up in London again."
15,678,"Sep 17 2009 	Ripped off..........	I telephoned (normally I internet it) and booked a room for 2 nights and was quoted a rate of 200+ per night which my wife called and confirmed the day afterwards. When I arrived I was told by the desk clerk that I had a very good rate and had been upgraded, which was a pleasant surprise. When I checked out, I had a bill not for 400 but for 832.60.I challenged them on this and they agreed to remove the internet charge of 14 for 24 hours use when I had sent 1 email lasting 30 seconds.They would not back down on the room rate and I asked for evidence of the confirmation email which I hadn't received. This arrived 8 days later. I have no record of ever having received the original otherwise I would have cancelled it there and then.The breakfast was served out of heated trays which for a 4 star hotel is not satisfactory and the one other real complaint is that the Underground and its vibrations could be heard all night long in the room. I shall not be staying again."
16,678,"Sep 15 2009 	Average Hotel not what I expected for a Crown Plaza	We booked the hotel on a travel site and got a great price on the hotel. If we had paid more, then I would have been even more dissappointed in this hotel. The lobby was very elegant and nice...and that is about where it stops. After that, it's pretty much a simple older Holiday Inn with some extra useless features. The hotel is a collection of many older buildings put together. So the journey to our room was down small hallways that went round many corners. Room was nice but not what I would expect for a Crown Plaza. Light switches were confusing and room was organized oddly. Bed was very uncomfortable. Bathroom looks nice, but heated towel bar didn't work and no water pressure in shower. On a big plus note, the window did open and it gave a nice breeze in the non A/C room. The biggest plus was that is was located close to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. We stayed at a nicely remodelled Holiday Inn in Russell Square that was so much nicer that this hotel."
17,678,"Sep 4 2009 	Great Hotel	I've stayed at the Plaza St James a few times on business and can safely say that on each occasion I have been looked after, the rooms have been spacious and the stay enjoyable. Thx"
18,678,"Aug 28 2009 	Great Location for seeing the sights	We stayed at Crowne Plaza, Buckingham Gate, to enjoy a touristy break in London. The location is excellent; literally two minutes from Buckingham Palace and less than 10 minutes to Westminster Abbey. The concierge was very helpful and his knowledge of the area and London could not be faulted. We had an internet deal which was room only, but the cost of breakfast is a whopping 17 pounds if you choose to eat in the hotel. A superior room is large and functional, clean and safe. This hotel was much preferable to The Hilton, Green Park, where we stayed earlier in the year for a similar price."
19,678,"Aug 27 2009 	Crown Plaza St. James London - A Luxurious experience	Tucked away in the bustling Buckingham gate area is this gem of a hotel. It is beautifully located in central London close to all the major attractions. One can walk around easily and see the sights. The theatres are close by and so is SOHO. The hotel has well-designed rooms as well as serviced apartments. The serviced apartments are extremely convenient and excellent value for money. The hotel has two speciality restaurants one of which is a delightful indian one called 'Quilon'. The food is Mmm delicious and the service is superb.The staff is extremely helpful and sensitive to the needs of their customers. The jeeves in particular, is a very knowledgeable man and is quick to offer brilliant solutions to the customers' problems. The property is beautifully maintained and we had the most joyous time here. We would definitely recommend it to people of all ages."
20,678,"Aug 23 2009 	Upscaleimmaculatebusiness/leisure hotel	This was a hotel booked through our cruise line. We were there for 3 nights. The rooms are not huge but they were immaculate. The service was extremely attentive. ( When I became ill, the manager of the hotel even escorted us to the physician.) The food was good but a little pricey. The location is fabulous, with stores and restaurants, theater and transportation accessible. The lobby is large, and bustling with many business people."
21,678,"Aug 22 2009 	Convenient	The hotel is about a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace. It is also a five minute walk to the route 24 bus line on Victoria. Taking the bus in front of the Westminster City Hall will take you to Trafalgar Square or the British Museum. Taking the 24 across the street to the end of the line will take you to Pimlico and a 10 minute walk to the Tate. From the Tate you can take the 87 to Trafalgar Square. If you want a long walk, you can walk along Victoria to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Parliament. Then, walk on past Downing Street and on toward Trafalgar Square. From there you can head to Picadilly and eventually come to the park near Buckingham Palace. Finally, past the palace and you are soon back at the hotel. Probably a 3-4 mile walk with a number of stops possible to each, take pictures, or ??? along the way.All in all the hotel facilities are just a bit above average. However, the concierges are great!!!! They were very helpful, always ready to mark up a map, and knew the bus routes. And, we had positive experiences with every member of the staff we encountered. Also, Monday to Friday there is a great little bistro down the street [blue awning] toward Buckingham Palace for breakfast [probably about 6-12 pounds, depending on the order for two people]. Also, there is a little package store in the same direction just before the church on the same side of the street as the hotel. The store has a variety of beverages and snacks at well below the hotel price. On Victoria Street there are a number of different restaurants."
22,678,Aug 18 2009 	Eventful stay at the St James	We used air miles to get a good deal at this hotel which included breakfast. It was one of the hottest days of the year when we entered our room to discover that the air conditioning was not working. Despite the prompt efforts of two employees our air conditioning problem was not satisfactorily resolved and we were given the used of a fan.The arrival of guests for breakfast is closely monitored and you can imagine our reaction on being told that breakfast was not included. having to contend for a breakfast which was rightfully ours was a situation we could have done without. Breakfast at the St. James costs no less than 22.50 and were anxious to ensure that that this was not charged to our account. By the way on the day of our arrival we had an all day breakfast (which was excellent) at an Italian restaurant just a few minutes walk from the hotel for the princely sum of 4.50 !The St. James's is in close proximity to Buckingham Palace. We did the palace tour which was simply wonderful and undoubtedly the highlight of our trip.On arriving back from the musical 'Wicked' which is playing nearby we could not gain access to our room. This was another hassle we could have done without and we were subsequently told that the placing of our cell phones beside our room keys had caused them to mal function. I didn't like the tea at breakfast but overall the breakfast was good.Yes I would stay at the St. James again.
23,678,"Aug 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel near Victoria Station 	The Crowne Plaza was a fantastic hotel from the welcome (a phone call from the reception desk as we arrived at Kings Cross) to check out! Upon check-in we received an unexpected upgrade to a suite that made this a very memorable trip! The reception staff and manager went out of their way to make us feel welcome and on top of everything this hotel is in a fantastic location - within 5 minutes walk of Buckingham Palace and around 15 minutes of Trafalgar Square. There are numerous good public transport options in the vicinity including Victoria station for tube, heavy rail and bus as well as the nearby St James's Park tube station."
24,678,"Aug 10 2009 	Location is the best	The hotel is nice but needs renovation. Very well placed, half-way between Westminster and Victoria station, very close to Buckingham Palace.The rooms are not so nice but overall experience is good."
25,678,"Jul 14 2009 	Fabulous staff far exceeded expectations.	Beautiful lobby, very professional staff who were genuinely pleased to welcome us to their hotel. Very helpful concierge, and a duty manager who was pleased to be able to offer us a fabulous upgrade to a two bedroom suite with a full kitchen , dining room and living room overlooking the inner courtyard. Complimentary coffee and shortbread cookies were offered after our wake up call - what a nice touch! Without exception, everyone made my entire family ' feel like a somebody'. Such a rarity in the hospitality industry these days! Great central location, close to the tube and the palace."
26,678,"Jul 7 2009 	Best concierge staff on the planet!	The concierge staff at the Crowne St. James is the best we've ever encountered. They went above and beyond the call of duty to see that our stay in London was exceptional. Anything we wanted in the room all we had to do was ask. Anything we wanted to attend we asked and not only were the arrangements made for us, but the seats were great! If we were not sure about what we would like to do next they made great suggestions. These were often things that happen once a year (like the trouping of the colors for the Queen's bithrday) that ,as visitors, we would have probably missed. In addition to the wonderful staff the location is perfect. We could walk to many wonderful sites including Buckingham Palace, Westminster Cathedral, and Parliament / Big Ben. Frederick, Fred S., Justin, and John Paul absolutely made our trip. We will always stay there.P.S. The bed was so comfortable sleeping in was a pleasure!"
27,678,"Jun 24 2009 	A nice hotel in a convenient location - would stay there again.	I stayed here for 8 nights in June 2009. Unlike some other reviewers my room was not tired at all. It was updated and very clean. The carpet was new, tiles in the bathroom were new and everything had been updated. I was traveling by myself and had a double bed - room 559. It was very quiet and I never heard anyone in another room. The view was only of office buildings - but I only used the room to sleep in so it didn't matter to me. The room was also very large for London - the biggest I've ever had. The TV had a lot of channels, there were 2 robes in the room, a pot for making coffee and tea and an ice bucket with a bottle of carbonated and still water - which they replenished each day as a courtesy if I drank them. There is also an ice maker on every floor which comes in very handy. And it had air conditioning that actually worked (rare for London).The room had a hairdryer on the wall in the bathroom without enough pressure for my hair, but it also had a hairdryer in the drawer of the dresser and there was a plug by the mirror and it was more powerful than the other. The water pressure was poor, but there was plenty of hot water and the bathroom was nice and large and clean - it even had a lighted makeup mirror on the wall. They provide soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, q-tips and a shower cap. There was also a full length mirror in the room, iron, ironing board, trouser press and safe.The Internet as others have said is ridiculous - 7lbs for 15min, 12lbs for 30mins or 15lbs for 24hrs. There is a pub nearby with free wifi, but I never used it - taking my laptop was a waste - I just used the Blackberry.It's located between St. James and Victoria Tube stations - a short walk from each. It's about a 15 min walk to get to Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus. You can go in front of Buckingham Palace and turn right on the Mall - but I preferred to turn right on Birdcage and go through St. James Park. West End shows are 20-30mins walk. Harrods is about 30 mins. Breakfast which was included in my rate was very good. They had lots of traditional English things like baked beans and mushrooms. They also had scrambled eggs everyday (you could ask for eggs cooked another way), rolls, chocolate croissants, fruits, meats, cereal, apple juice and orange juice. For lunch the Broadway Cafe offers good sandwiches at very reasonable prices. There is also a convenience store right by the hotel where I got some snacks. Most of the area was closed when I got back after 9:00. The staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I arrived at 7am, check-in wasn't until 2:00, but they got me a room by 8:30am. I would absolutely stay there again and recommend to others - at least if you get room 559!"
28,678,"Jun 20 2009 	Fantastic location excellent staff but I agree... tired rooms...	We stayed here for 4 nights June 13-17. We did the advance purchase rate for a superior room (avg. price per night = GBP115) and also took advantage of my ICHotels points to get a free nights stay. Room: Our room was absolutely HUGE - much bigger than I expected. I would definitely pay a bit more to get a superior room. As other reviewers have noted, the carpets were a bit aged, the walls a bit a scuffed up, and the curtains were noticeably old. However, for us, this is only a place to rest and it was incredibly comfortable. The TV in our room had loads of channels and our bathroom was plenty big and didn't seem dated as previous reviewers had noted (although the shower pressure was awful, but I think that's true of most places in London). Our room was very quiet and private. When we were there, they updated the locks on the room and it also appeared that they were changing out beds (this was on the 6th floor). I'd request the 6th floor as it seemed to be more updated than the other floors. Hotel: The common areas of the hotel are absolutely impressive. I would agree that internet is outrageous, but if you walk around the corner, on France Petty street there is a pub with free wifi. Go there and sign on rather than pay GBP10/hour! There were plenty of places closeby with free internet but this pub in particular was really comfortable with great food (its the first one you come to on the left when you are walking to the tube stop).Staff: INCREDIBLY helpful. Fred the concierge quickly got us into Nobu for our anniversary dinner. We were allowed a late checkout (but I think because I'm a gold member of the ICHotels group). Everyone was extremely friendly and they made being there very easy.Location: My husband and I walked absolutely everywhere thanks to the perfect sunny weather we enjoyed during our stay. The location is perfect. We had a great stroll through St. James Park and Hyde Park, easily caught the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, and were thankful for the short walk to the tube (only 2-3 minutes max). We even walked all the way to Piccadilly Circus - it really isn't that far. The neighborhood around the hotel has everything you could need - department stores, Boots (drug store), even Pizza Hut and McDonalds. There are so many options closeby that I would try these rather than dine in the hotel, which has very overpriced food (we didn't even try it).All in all, even though the rooms are dated, the location is so central and perfect and the staff is so great that I would highly recommend a stay here. If you do the advance purchase rate (even though I booked 2.5 months in advance, they didn't charge my card until I arrived anyway so it didn't make much of a difference to do APR purchase), you will get a great deal. We will definitely stay here when we return to London, whether or not the room have been udpated."
29,678,"Jun 16 2009 	Location common areas are nice but rooms need work	There is no questioning the benefit of this hotel's location in London, for it puts you within 5 minutes' walk of Buckingham Palace, the Tube, and just a couple minutes further to Westminster Abbey and Parliament. The hotel's restaurants, gathering areas, and lobby are impressive. Unfortunately, these first impressions faded quickly when my wife and I entered our room. While everything was clean and proper, the room quality did not match the quality of the remainder of the hotel. Our carpets were worn and pulled up in places, the bed was aged with several hollow spots within it, and the bathroom was in need of upgrading (e.g., the tiles were not dirty, but stained with age; the soap holders had been relocated several times, leaving patched holes on the wall; the countertop was also stained with age).On the positive side, the staff were extremely helpful with any request, and the concierge desk was always willing to provide assistance and advice when asked.However, given the price paid for the room, the extra charges for most everything (such as business center, high-speed internet, phone usage, etc.), the rooms in need of upgrading, and the abundance of competing hotels throughout the city, I would seek another hotel until the rooms here have been updated."
30,678,"Jun 11 2009 	Extremely comfortable great business hotel	This was my second stay at this Crowne Plaza hotel for business. Both times I've been upgraded to larger executive rooms with free magazines and bathrobes. The staff have been wonderful and couldn't be more helpful. I'd love to come back to this hotel for a personal visit, if only to sit in their gorgeous inner courtyard with large fountain for high tea, or try their Michelin-starred restaurant if the weather is poor."
31,678,Jun 6 2009 	Good location but rooms are average	Used this hotel a couple of times. Superior rooms are ok in terms of size but all rooms are a little tired and beds are only average for comfort. Tend to use restaurants and pubs nearby as food isnt special and is heavily priced. Pub around corner does good English Breakfast for half the price of hotel.
32,678,Jun 3 2009 	lovely	The hotel is very close to Buckingham palace which provides one a great opportunity to enjoy the great parks nearby particularly in the summer. Most of the tourist locations are closeby. They have an Indian restaurant making the hotel good choice for Asians.
33,678,"Jun 1 2009 	Location location location - BUT - could do with a bit of renovation	No doubt this hotel is convenient. Right next to Buckingham Palace (become the Queen's neighbour for a night or two). Quite accessible from St James' Park underground station (a little further from Victoria station). Hotel is grand on the outside and in the lobby (although the doorman kept ignoring me, never really offered to open the door for me). Front desk staff was helpful otherwise. Agree with some of the past reviewers in that the hotel is in need of renovation. The rooms are spacious enough, but the signs of wear and tear are only too obvious on the walls in the room. Stayed here for a half price special, and really, overall, given the price and the location, this would be ideal for a short stay in London for those who want to stay close to all the major attractions."
34,678,May 21 2009 	Stay Away!!!	Worst Hotel ever.... Breakfast room like a hostel..... Rooms are old an dingy.... shower pressure pathetic.... VERY Disappointing
35,678,"May 6 2009 	Poor	Hotel surprisingly poor. Was expecting better. Delay checking in as room key didn't work and had to return to get another. Corridors were murky, narrow, and desperately needed renovation. Room not much better - definitely seen better days. Cramped and generally annoying.Breakfast service even worse - staff rushing around, poor selection of food, room cramped.Would definitely not return. This hotel is overpriced for hotels in its class. About the only thing it has going for it is the location, which would be handy for a tourist."
36,678,May 5 2009 	Great Hotel	We enjoyed our stay in this hotel immensely. The staff was terrific our room was wonderful - clean and nice size. We were upgraded at the front desk - just because we asked. The concierge staff practically became our best friends they were so helpful with everything. I would absolutely stay here again - without a doubt.
37,678,"May 1 2009 	Very Nice Hotel in great central London location	Stayed 5 nights in April. Front desk staff could not have been more accommodating. Got us a 9 a.m. check in after arriving from an overnight train trip from Scotland. Lovely room on 6th floor overlooking courtyard. Full English breakfast included in rate of just over $200 (US) per night--good value for London. St. James tube stop just a 5 minute walk, Victoria Station a 10 minute walk. Buckingham Palace close by. Convenience store right around corner came in handy. Would certainly stay here again."
38,678,"Apr 28 2009 	Could do better...	We stayed in this hotel for two nights. Despite my husband being a Gold Priority Card holder, we were given what must be the worst room in the hotel. It was triangular shaped, very small with a view of a wall!! Very dark as a result and we had to squeeze past the end of the bed to get round it. This really is either a room for a solo traveller or those who they think won't complain!! So we spoke to reception and were relocated to a much nicer room with a view of the courtyard for the second night. It was three times the size. The hotel looks great when you arrive and in general the staff were friendly. We ate in the Bank restaurant one of the nights and the food was amazing. Would highly recommend it. Cost 87 for two for two courses and bottle of nice wine. Overall the location is great and if you get the right room, it's value for money!"
39,678,"Apr 27 2009 	All Good	I would definitely stay here again. Great location, great staff and decent rooms (lack of drinks choice in the bar though!). Overall good value. Thank you."
40,678,"Apr 27 2009 	Lovely Hotel great location	I booked this as a present for my Mother. So got a good deal when i booked it some months ago for 160.Turning up outside was lovely, looked such a grand place. Our bag was taken away straight away and then reception upgraded our room which was great news.The room was pretty dated to be honest, very large, but needs a bit of TLC i think. I must say the hairdryer was awful! So slow. Just glad mum and i have short hair!!The staff were brilliant. We did'nt eat at the hotel, well apart from Breakfast, which i must say was lovely! Great fresh fruits etc. But the hotel had some great places to eat. We had a few drinks in the bars though and it was lovelyThe tube station is only 5 mins walk away. and Buck Palace only a 10 minute walkI would def stay here again and recommend to friends.We could leave our bag there too on the Sunday so we could do more sight seeing!!"
41,678,"Apr 25 2009 	Nice stay	Not a bad stay,Nice court view,and room was a good size. Close to Buckingham Palace and all other attractions. Only downside was we had to cheack dead on 2pm and no earlier and was not offered anywhere to leave luggage. Other than that all was good"
42,678,"Apr 25 2009 	Great Location - nice hotel dear for food and drink	This hotel could not be better located - it is a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a short stroll to the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey.My wife and I stayed there for a two night stay with my rewards points and despite the fact that we were staying free I was upgraded as a Priority Club Platinum member.The room was lovely and the whole hotel has a nice classy feel about it. The staff could not be more helpful and overall this is a really nice hotel.However when we went to the bar for a drink they only serve bottled beer and double measures of spirits meaning an expensive bar bill if you spent all night in the hotel bar. The evening meal in Bistro 51 again was very expensive for what can only be described as average food. There are two other restaurants (The Bank Restaurant and Quillon - an Indian with a Michelin star) but these are very expensive compared to the restaurant we ate in.A tip would be to come out of the hotel, turn left and walk about 100 yards until you come to the traffic lights and then turn right down a street called Petty France where you will find a delightful pub called the Buckingham Arms where they serve nice meals and good beer.As I stated the hotel itself is superb and could not be better located or staffed so overall an excellent stay."
43,678,Apr 24 2009 	Handy for the changing of the guard	This isn't the best Crowne Plaza in London - and in fact for those really keen on geography its probably in Westminster. Its not as chic and modern as the Crowne Plaza at Blackfriars in the City of London and some of the rooms are a little tired. But it is in a great location for sightseeing. Buckingham Palace is a 3 minute walk away. The Houses of Parliament are close enough for me to be on the flight path of the police helicopter on budget day this week and on a nice day a stroll through the Royal Parks is a must if you have the time. Some of the rooms are quirky and if you are buying at the lower end of the range it can be a bit of a lucky dip. I had a nice room this week and the service as usual was great.
44,678,"Apr 21 2009 	Location Location Location!	This is a nice hotel in a fantastic location. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Green Park etc. Easy walk to St James Park tube station. Our room was larger than I expected for London, and very quiet. The breakfast here was fantastic! We got a good deal when booking here, with breakfast included. In room internet charge was too expensive, especially considering how many internet cafe's there are in London. Complimentary chocolate, shortbread, and water daily are a nice extra touch. Would come back here just for the breakfast if we got a similar deal again!"
45,678,"Apr 20 2009 	Wonderful staff great location -	I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the above hotel. I cannot praise highly enough the staff especially Reception. Our rooms were very comfortable and right near the elevators as requested (as one of our group has walking difficulties). The location of the hotel is really central, to be able to walk through St James Park on a wonderful spring day is in itself priceless. The hotel is in a very a quiet neighbourhood, at least at weekends as it is surrounded by offices. I felt really safe walking around the hotel. As mentioned in some reviews the bathrooms are a little tired looking, but that just adds to the charm of the hotel. I found everything spotless.I have stayed in a number of hotels in London and this is the only one that I will stay in again. ."
46,678,"Apr 20 2009 	Great value for the location	Hi,Stayed here on the Saturday night at a very affordable rate. Check-in was friendly and courteous and we were given a free upgrade to a Superior Room. The room was spotless, the bed extremely comfortable, the shower superb - really, all one would ask for in a 4 star room. The real plus is the location - right in the heart of central London, yet on a quiet road so no traffic issues. The decor is more old-world than modernist, but some people (like my wife) like that!The only quibble I'd have is that the breakfast is somewhat overpriced for these credit crunch times at almost 50 for 2, so we ate elsewhere. Otherwise, very satisfied and would go back."
47,678,"Apr 13 2009 	Great location just an ok hotel	I stayed at this hotel April 5-8. It was booked for a conference at the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Centre that I was attending but I was also there to do some sightseeing. If you are a tourist who wants to see a lot of the top sites in London, it's in one of the best locations. It was literally steps away from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park. If you take a right out of the hotel you are at the St. James tube stop. A 10 minute walk to Westminster Abbey, House of Parliament, Big Ben - and then right across the bridge to the London Eye. We were able to walk to Green Park, Hyde Park, and do some shopping around the Picadilly area too. The hotel itself was nothing special though - tiny and outdated rooms, expensive internet (not wireless), small and old bathrooms (the shower especially was awful). The bed was not very comfortable and the room just didn't have that &quot;clean&quot; look and feel. The walls were also thin. My rate had breakfast included which was pretty nice - but I would never pay the 20 pounds they charged on the menu! The concierge was not very helpful either. It wasn't a cheap hotel - I think my rate was almost 200 quid a night - so I would say if there are others in that area you can stay in, it'd probably be a better bet."
48,678,"Apr 5 2009 	Great location hotel needs work	While this hotel is in a prime location for sight seeing, my wife and I found it to be less than expected from a Crowne Plaza once we got beyond the lobby. Our first night was in a room that was pretty worn down with burnt out light bulbs and low hissing noise; our second was marginally better (looked like the bathroom had recently been redone, although the grout in the tub was not done well), but still in need of an freshening given that this is a Crowne Plaza. We were not able to move rooms the first night and our bags were not moved for us, as was promised, when we got back from our day the second. Both rooms were large and reasonably clean, but neither of us could get past the general need for an update in the rooms and hallways. Also, I'm not sure if this is typical in London, but the room did not have a clock.Still, the location was outstanding and the staff helpful and responsive. Seemed to be more of a business travel-focused hotel, but worked well for leisure trip as well. Some fresh paint and a few updates would make the hotel outstanding."
49,678,Apr 2 2009 	Nice location for a short trip to London.	We really enjoyed this hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful. Our room was larger than we expected. We had plenty of room. It was within walking distance of Buckingham Palace. The restaurant was also good.
50,678,Mar 30 2009 	Great hotel amazing location super deals!	The location is amazing. The Hotwire price was the best deal that I could get for this hotel. The room that I got was on the 2nd floor and did not have any views but I do not complain as I stayed for 90 GBP/night. The hotel is operated by the Taj group and hence has a number of Indian dishes on the in-room dining menu. The Michelin Starred 'Quilon' restaurant is also a part of this hotel and it serves some very authentic Kerala cuisine. I will certanly stay here again if I get a deal like the one I got on Hotwire.
51,678,"Mar 28 2009 	Really tired old rooms	Stayed for three nights with my wife &amp; got really good rate - just as well because this is nowhere near standards of any other crowne plaza we've stayed in. The location is good as it's central &amp; safe. Public areas are ok &amp; staff friendly - giving impression this is really swish hotel. However we ended up looking at three different rooms because they either smelt of damp or looked onto a brick wall etc. What they all had in common was they were all small rooms &amp; were really tired, with paper peeling, scuffs to fixtures etc. To cap it all - they swiped our bill onto our friends card and vice versa - just as well they were friends. You could find much better than this."
52,678,"Mar 24 2009 	Another fantastic visit .....	I've just come back from another 3 days stay at the Crowne Plaza St James, this was my 2nd stay there and once again had a fabulous time. The hotel is great and all the staff are probably the nicest in London, never had a surly awkward person to deal with which can't be said for my stay in other London hotels. Would always stay here, fantastic location - minutes from St James Park tube and near to great restaurants and shops - check out the Albert for great food and atmosphere. In the other direction Buckingham Palace and 10 - 15 mins walk to Westminster if you want to stretch your legs rather than tube it.Breakfast was included in our stay and although it is lovely I probably wouldn't pay the extra for it, it is rather expensive and their are lots of places to eat if you turn right out of the hotel.Great place, great staff, great location and I can't wait to go back in August."
53,678,"Mar 15 2009 	High-class hotel large and pleasant room excellent location	Located very close to Buckingham Palace, a walking distance from Victoria station. A high-class hotel, where everything from the lobby to the room is nicely decorated. The rooms are large and, unlike what was written on (at least) one review, ours was in pristine condition (except perhaps for the wood around the window frame in the bathroom, but this is not such an issue). Welcoming service, with complimentary biscuits, chocolate (with mint, unfortunately) and water.I would strongly recommend this hotel, also because the location is really convenient, as you can walk through a park to the heart of London."
54,678,"Mar 8 2009 	A good alternative to the busy West End	This Crowne Plaza has a wonderful 'clubby' old world feel, the rooms are large though the standard beds are small so you may be better off with single beds pushed together if you need more space. The low water pressure in our 6th floor room made the shower so pathetic that we ended up using the tub.The ground floor bar is very nice and is well used by guests. I would reccomend the Crowne Plaza for any first time visitor to London.St. James &amp; Westminster have that 'Olde London' feel, there are some good local pubs that do not get too overcrowded, particularly early evening, when you can usually find a seat. The local Underground, St. James, is on the Circle line, which makes travel to any part of London, or any attraction, very easy."
55,678,"Mar 7 2009 	Excellent base for sightseeing	We have just returned from the Crowne Plaza and had a very pleasant stay. We got one night for 50% off, which for the standard of this hotel was really good value.Our room (456) was fine and spacious (best we have experienced in a central London hotel). We did have possibly the smallest bathroom we have ever seen but this wasnt a problem. The room has a great range of facilities, and was clean and in good condition. The only slight problem was that the lights didnt always come on straight away, which I was informed was due to the age of the building. It wasnt a major issue  in fact, we quite liked the quirky nature! The staff were attentive and friendly, especially the reception ladies and the concierge. We didnt have breakfast at the hotel but we did have lunch in their Quilon restaurant, which was absolutely delicious and a must if you like Indian food. The location was fab! We have never stayed this side of London before but we will be in future. So much was in walking distance, which is just great. And not too far from the underground either. It is an ideal base for those visiting Buckingham Palace. We would highly recommend this hotel and hope to re-visit soon."
56,678,"Mar 4 2009 	Top Quality	This hotel is consistently good value. Having stopped over for a weekend recently, the experience was excellent from efficient check in to check out. Room was fine and spacious, only gripe was that the carpets were worn. Bathroom was OK, water pressure was poor though therefore the shower was not great but sufficied. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. The staff were attentive and efficient without being imposing. The hotel bar is not big and can be busy, drinks were typical London prices but service was top class. The location sells this hotel, short walking distance to Buckingham Palace and ideal for a base. All in all, an excellent stay and would recommend the hotel."
57,678,"Feb 24 2009 	A lovely romantic weekend...	We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The standard room we had was spacious, comfortable and well decorated. The minibar was well stocked although very expensive, but that's to be expected really. Room service menu was very varied, with prompt delivery and lovely presentation of food.We dined twice at the hotel, firstly at the Michelin star Indian restaurant. We found the food to be brilliant, cooked to perfection with great service - a waiter even crumbed the table! The other hotel food we tried was at the Hamptons bar. I had possibly the most delicious Bolegnese I've ever tried, and it was served quickly so that we could rush off to catch our train.Reception and the concierge are very helpful, with quick check out/check in and them attending to your every need. All in all I would definitely reccomend staying here because it is in a good (fairly quiet but still central) location.The only negative was that the bed seemed really short. I am only 5&quot;6 and my feet were off the end of the bed. The mattress was very comfortable, however.Another issue was the weekend maintenance work on the Circle and District lines, which hindered our travel somewhat. However this was not at all the fault of the hotel."
58,678,"Feb 20 2009 	Bed too small Room Noisy	Just arrived back from a one night stay at this hotel, we booked with Air Miles as a second choice collected from a number of years ago.Check in &amp; reception very good, although we noticed a very off putting table set up outside the dining room with a cold piece of steak and vegetables to show what the dining room can do, this put us off more than attracted us. We were given room 270 non smoking. Following a couple of phone calls to find out where our case was it arrived 30 minutes later. The bed was a small double not really suitable for two people. The bathroom adequate however we were surprised the loo seat was too small and loose. Trying to sleep in a small bed is not easy at the best of times but when you have an air conditioning unit outside that stops and starts every twenty minutes was a nightmare, then at 6.40 am the District Line tube starts and rumbles past that was the last straw.Would we return No sorry too noisy, bed too small &amp; certainly expect a loo seat not to be falling off as it was too small."
59,678,"Feb 11 2009 	Jewel in the Crowne	Just back from a great 3 day stay at the hotel. It was supposed to be only 2 days, but weather forced a third night stayover when flights to Dublin were suspended. They could not have been more accommodating in helping me to re arrange my flight. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The hotel oozes old world charm and standards. The Hamptons bar is a fabulous place to relax after a hectic day in London. As for the location, its perfect, with so much to see within a few minutes walk.Will I be back ? At the very first oppertunity."
60,678,"Feb 2 2009 	home away from home	This hotel is our home when we are in London. The location is excellent, close to lots of attractions and transport. The rooms are comfy and nicley decorated. They have recently been upgrading us to a jr suite but on previous stays, the regular rooms are fine. Nice lobby and courtyard. The staff are quite good. They are always friendly and helpful and have good face recogntion. I always get a cheery welcome back mrs b when I stumble out of taxi laden with luggage and again at the front desk. After a day of travelling, this is nice. The security guys are great! I once lost an address book and though they never found it, tore apart a room, made a follow up call and told me that since they did have my permission, would send it on if ever found. Permission was needed as the chief of security told me &quot; we don't usually send left items without express permission since some guests would prefer that those at home did not know they were staying&quot; So, I guess they are discreet. Room service is a mixed bag. They keep changing the menu and lately it's had a definite asian slant. If I want a curry, I'll go to brick lane. Still, the club sandwich and cheese burger rank high. I use the club/burger equation in rating a hotel......if they can't do those, I'm outta' there.the spa facilities were okay but nothing to write home about. My husband gripes at the size of the sauna but I tried it a few months ago and it was fine. due to the age of the building, there seems to always be a little technical glitch. These are seen to promptly. Elevator not working, guy there to show you to the others. water pressure problems, room upgraded. heating gone amiss, engineer to look at it and portable heating installed.Overall, it feels like a slightly quirky lux hotel and not a corporate cookie cutter. The business services are fine also."
61,678,"Jan 21 2009 	So close to Buckingham Palace	If you going to London and are looking for something of good quality but not hugly expensive, I would say you will be ok booking into this hotel. The hotel is just 5 mins from St James Park tube and 8.00 from Shaftsbury Avenue in Taxi and not much more from Euston Station. The staff were polite, professional and friendly and the room was big enough (we had a room over looking the court yard), maybe slightly tired but prefect for what we wanted. We didnt have dinner in the hotel, breakfast was a bit strange but we were not in the restaurant as the hotel was very busy, however I think during the week breakfast should be fine. And it is less than 5 mins walk to Buckingham Palace. I would definatly stay again."
62,678,"Jan 17 2009 	Ugh should have been better	Well, the location is fine. Just down the street from several good places to eat, and a good pub. BUT... we had all kinds of mold in our bath room, and all the furniture came in to the room before I was born (1974). If you want to save some money, this will do the trick. if you have your wife with you, and she doesn't like dirty places.... pay more. Also, the bar and restaurant in the hotel both are bad. But who the heck drinks in the hotel bar and eats in the hotel restaurant in London?Only stay here if you want to save money."
63,678,"Jan 6 2009 	Very pleasant experience!	We booked this hotel with a package deal that meant we got the rooms at a good price. Myself and my partner went for 4 days around New Years Eve. I found the service to be quite good at the lobby. The room itself was big and clean. We ordered room service twice, and one time the food arrived warm and not hot. Our room, while it was nice, was located right at the back of the hotel, literally 150+ steps from the elevator, which wouldnt have been nice if you had elderly guest, or very young children, but we didnt mind too much. We also dined in their restaurant, the Bistro. The service was excellent, and the food was delicious! Though, it was the most expensive night we had the whole time we were there.Good for location, good service, and overall, a very pleasant experience!"
64,678,"Jan 5 2009	Value for money	We booked the hotel well in advance so got great value for money, especially for a London hotel in such a fantastic location.We were on a flying visit between Christmas and New Year and the Crowne Plaza made a pleasant base for our hectic itinerary. The only complaint is that the bed seemed to be partially made, with a thin white quilt cover that looked more like a quilt protector - ditto the pillow covers. There was no sheet, no bed cover and seemingly no pillow cases. The quilt was also extremely thin and there were no extra blankets in the room, so I was a little cold in the night.The reception staff was very friendly and efficient.We had a great meal and cocktails in the adjoining Bank Westminster restaurant."
65,678,"Jan 4 2009 	Good hotel great location!	I stayed here for one night between Christmas and New Year, and really did enjoy the stay.The lobby is very impressive, and as soon as you leave this area the hotel does seem older - however, our room was perfectly clean, very spacious and had a lovely bathroom. We had no issues with cleanliness, and although the room was a little old-fashioned, there really was nothing wrong with it. The bed and pillows were a little hard, I think they were a bit old and may need replacing soon!The room was larger than others I have had in London, so no complaints there.However, I managed to get a great deal on Lastminute.com, and the room only cost 59 a night - an absolute bargain in central London!! I think I may have been slightly disappointed if I had paid upwards of 130 per night though.The location is great, Buckingham Palace is about 2 mins walk away and St James tube is right around the corner. The area is very quiet at weekends, but felt very safe walking back to the hotel late evening.I'm not sure if I would stay here again, if I could get a bargain rate I definately would, but for full price there are other hotels for tourists that are more modern and maybe a bit more convenient. Not a 5* hotel, but easily a 4* and definately not a bad choice - just shop around and make sure you are getting a good deal!"
66,678,"Jan 1 2009 	The worst by far	The location is perfect, reception area is as you would expect a deluxe hotel to be and the staff were pleasant and helpful. After reception the illusion of deluxe 4 star hotel ends then it turn dreadful, drab and dingy. Our room was absolutely tiny, the bed side table had a tray with 1 bottle of water (for 2 people) and huge bedside lamps cant put anything. And there is console table which is also cluttered with a tray of nick naks for sale. And wallpaper is peeling and the window frames are dusty and rotten carpet dirty with spots."
67,678,"Dec 31 2008 	Old fashioned hotel but good location	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights. I had asked for a non smoking room and they gave me a smoking room. When I realised and went back to reception their response was &quot;but we have upgraded you&quot;. I didn't take the upgrade and got my non-smoking room which was small, stuffy and dirty with stains on the carpet in the bedroom and stains on the tiles in the bathroom. Needless to say that I didn't want to stay there and asked for another room. The hotel was fully booked and they asked me to talk to the manager. The on duty manager was very helpful and even though the hotel was fully booked offered me an upgrade at no extra cost for my entire stay to a better room, which was spacious and clean. This really saved the holiday. The breakfast was average with the staff not very attentive."
68,678,"Dec 24 2008 	Good Value and Service	I use this hotel regulalrly when I travel to London on business (about 8 times a year). I am a Priority Club member, so I find the club membership good value in terms of upgrades. The Hotel reflects recent investments made to the property, but retains much of its old world charm. Its location would be very suited to tourist and travellers as the Royal Parks and Buckingham Palace are close by. For business the facilities are good and the rates are reasonable. The service is consistently good with professional staff who always give prompt attention to requests. I've stayed in many London hotels (over 100 trips in the last 10 years). This is one of my favorites."
69,678,"Dec 21 2008 	Top of the "" Crowne""	We stayed at this Hotel a long time ago for One night on our way to connect for a holiday starting from London at that time the place was fine for an overnight, so we decided we wanted a theatre weekend in October 08 and decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza ,St James and boy what a place it really has been transformed.We were directed to the Reception desk, where we checked in and was told out room and the keys were given. we stayed in 770 at the back very quite looking onto offices. lovely room with plenty space for your clothes, hospitality tray ,safe, television and mini bar which is very expensive (Sainsbury's just round the corner in Victoria Street) if you require your eats) Bathroom not bad and boy we have visited some hotels and they have been rubbish. The room itself was cleaned every day we cannot complain about this.Breakfast on the Saturday was Buffet you can help yourself with as much as you want this was taken in the Bistro restaurant where we took Dinner, the day we left , the restaurant was so busy that they had to open up another dining room so we were guided to this place and it was not very nice at all very drab the food was slightly warm as they who used this place kept the lids off the food warmers so if you go here just remember to close these warmers and you wont have any problems,All in all this hotel is very handy for all shows, tubes, buses and Victoria station and is within walking distance to the palace.We would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in London for the weekend , we would use it again next year."
70,678,"Dec 15 2008 	loved the this hotel	stayed at this hotel for the weekend 12th-14th dec lovely hotel enormous and very nice inside, it was my husbands birthday and i had ordered a bottle of champagne and when we were shown to our room a gentleman was waiting outside with it and 2 glasses on a tray which was really nice. the room was huge with a lovely comfy bed and a nice marble bathroom with heated towel rail, also a big flat screen tv, got a good nights sleep as it was very quiet didnt see a soul in the corridors and the hotel was very busy, lovely xmas trees every where and the hotel is very nicely decorated, great service by all staff from doorman to dining room staff, had a lovely steak meal on our first night which was in our package this is unusual as you are often only allowed certain things when on a package, had a lovely indian meal on the second night at the quillon restaurant next door this was also lovely, if a little expensive but it is london, the drinks in the bar were rather dear as well but served nice and tasted good, been on a few hilton packages but this was far better would definitely go again."
71,678,"Dec 12 2008 	Nice Room	Over on business with over associates and stayed in Room 774 and loved it. Positives Great room plenty of spaceNegativesStaff at counter on arrival very slowMeals a bit priceySummaryWas upgraded to this room which was very liveable, would of been topped of if it had some views"
72,678,"Dec 5 2008 	Great Stay At The St James	Stayed one night at the start of Dec and can only say positive things about the experience, tucked away out of the general hustle and bustle of the capital, it is well presented and maintained.Our room was clean and well kept and the bathroom was huge with a nice range of toiletries (important factor for my wife in judging any hotel).Breakfast was excellent although the list price of 20 would have been to steep if not included in our room rate!We will definitely return."
73,678,"Dec 4 2008 	Very Good Hotel Experience	Had a very nice 3 night stay here and was impressed by the staff who without exception were pleasant, efficient and courteous. The location is excellent as mentioned by previous reviewers &amp; we walked everywhere. The weather was sunny but cold so was perfect walking weather. Dined at the Bank Restaurant and were happy with the food quality and choice. Our room was average size &amp; had tea/cofee maker and there were nice extra touches like chocolate, fruit and water. Everything was clean. We were very pleased with this hotel and would recommend it. Would have rated it 'Excellent ' rather than 'Above Average' except the wall socket was tempermental. I loved that we could open the windows properly and didn't have to rely on air conditioning which I dislike.Its a nice quiet neighbourhood too and makes for a good nights sleep."
74,678,"Nov 24 2008 	Fantastic experience	I got a great deal on this hotel by going through the website of the 'Holiday Inn Express' who include this hotel in their promotions. As it was a special occasion (I was proposing!!) I wanted to stay somewhere very special. 124 for a superior room with breakfast. We arrived by tube at lunchtime, St James' Park station is literally a 3 or 4 minute walk from the hotel. Although we were an hour early for check in there was no problem and we were allowed into our room which was on the 2nd floor. The room was really nice and very large. The bathroom was also a good size. the bed was very soft. One problem was that the bathoom could get very cold due to the draught coming through the old window. I arranged for my girlfriend to have some treatments at the spa as a suprise. The spa is a short walk across the courtyard behind the hotel. The staff were really friendly and made her feel very special. She had a facial and hot stones massage which i'm told were amazing. Hotel guests are allowed to use the gym so i took advantage of this. The gym was well equipped and very clean. For anybody worried about security, the room was equipped with a safe. I was also challenged by a security guard when i used the rear entrance to the hotel, he was very apologetic when he realised that i was a guest but i assured him it was not a problem. Prior to going out for dinner we had a drink in 'The Hamptons' bar in the hotel. Staff were very attentive and the atmosphere was very good.  In all a lovely hotel for the occasion. Located about 150 metres from Buckingham Palace where my proposal was accepted. We will definately return here."
75,678,"Nov 8 2008 	Location location ?	Definitely : a 2 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, 8 to Westminster Abbey, 10 to Trafalgar Square. St.James tube station is round the corner. What more could you want? Well, from a 4 star hotel a little more, I think. The standard rooms are small and some are dated. It took some persuasion at Reception to get a spacious room overlooking the courtyard. Our bathroom had dodgy plumbing; the water from the sink appeared in the bath ! We were with our daughter and partner who ordered a newspaper two days running and never got one. The concierge, although charming, gave us duff information on two separate occasions.Nevertheless it was a pleasant stay, the staff were keen to please, and the breakfast was good ( be ready to queue at weekends). Oh ,did I mention location ? Perfect."
76,678,"Nov 3 2008 	Loved the Crowne Plaza	We loved our stay at the Crowne Plaza St. James. From the top-hatted doorman to the extremely comfortable bed, this hotel met or exceeded our expecations. The location was perfect for sightseeing; only a block to Buckingham Palace and the Tube station is only around the corner. The room had all the modern amenitites. Wired internet ran 14.99GBP/day or you could pay a fee to have unlimited internet and movies via the TV.We did not expect much with regard to customer service or room amenities, having heard about the normally tiny rooms in Britain and potentially rude service. This was not our experience. The clerks at the desk and concierge were extremely polite and helpful. The standard room we booked had plenty of room and the price was right! Our prepaid room was cheaper than anything we found anywhere on the internet.The hotel has a full gym and spa, but no jacuzzi or pool. You can borrow outlet adapters, but if your plug is large (like the one I use for my cell phone), you would be better off buying one before you arrive, as theirs have a ridge of plastic that prevents the larger sized plugs from being inserted all the way. We received a fresh supply of complimentary toilettries each day and the towel warming rack made getting out of the shower on those cold mornings a little more comforting.The only complaint I would have about our room is the size of the bath/shower. It was impossible to have a shower without the shower curtain touching you somewhere on your person at all times. The hotel would do well to invest in the bowed shower curtains now popular in American hotel rooms.All in all, we had a lovely stay and would gladly stay there again."
77,678,"Oct 27 2008 	Great location!!!!	great place to stay!!! arrived with no problems and left with no problems..Friendly staff, met all my needs.Arrived late in the evening, asked for an upgrade due to priority platnum member, they said they wouldn't be able to that evening come back the next day and see what the can do..I came back later the next evening.. and i was upgraded to a suite no questions asked other then when can we pick up my luggage to move it..the location was perfect for to young people looking to walk all over london.. close to everything..we walked for hours each day, and was 10-15 minutes away from everything..hotel needs a little upgrade, but nothing major. Unless you expect to stay in the hotel 24 hours a day, then maybe, but it was clean and a great place to laye your head after a day of walking and a night at the theater..will stay again.."
78,678,"Oct 21 2008 	Great staff old world atmosphere	Stayed here while attending an interview in London. The staff were very accommodating and provided somewhere to change even though my room was not ready.The room itself was fine and my leaking bath was seen to very promptly and I was thanked for making the effort to report it! The hotel is one of the few left where your room is prepared in the evening, curtains closed, fresh towels and even a chocolate on the pillow. Simple touches but they make a difference.I would stay here again if I had the chance as it is well connected and comfortable."
79,678,Oct 20 2008 	Great hotel great location	Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and was thoroughly impressed. Staff were very attentive and always willing to help. The location is also very handy. It is within walking distance to many attractions and a short stroll to St. James tube station.The room was in good condition and cleaned immaculately daily. I will definitely stay here again.
80,678,"Oct 12 2008	Impressive	Impressive, elegant 4 star hotel fabulously located a stroll from Buckingham Palace, St James's Park and other London attractions. Our twin room was very pleasant and the bed comfy. Atmospheric courtyard gardens, competent staff, recommended choice of restaurants plus traditional pubs close by. Breakfast plentiful. Stayed as part of a theatre break but excellent internet offers available for BB. Needed a longer stay to fully appreciate the facilities this hotel has to offer."
81,678,"Oct 11 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	We recently had a short break at the St James Hotel. The hotel was most impressive, as was our room. It was very comfortable and quiet as it overlooked the courtyard.I have never been in a hotel anywhere where the staff were so friendly and pleasant. They were most welcoming.I would certainly go back again if we are in London. The hotel is well positioned for St James Park tube station and so it is easy to get around London."
82,678,"Oct 6 2008 	Jewel in the Crowne.	I stayed at this hotel last weekend for two nights. Having seen an advert in a national newspaper, I rang central reservations directly and got a great offer - 109 per room per night for two people, bed and breakfast with dinner on the first night included.The position of the hotel is very central but that doesn't make it noisy as it's in a relatively quite side street.The room and bathroom were both quite big for London standards and were equipped with every necessity including bathrobes.The included dinner on the first night was a three-course meal offering four choices for each course. It was nicely-presented and very tasty, as was the breakfast we had on both mornings which provided the usual selection and was served by attentive staff.The hotel boasts a beautiful courtyard garden, comfortable lounge areas, three restaurants, two bars and a spa centre. Not having a lot of time, we weren't able to take advantage of all these facilities but saw enough to appreciate the quality and style of this hotel.We hope to return in the near future."
83,678,"Oct 1 2008 	Great hotel to celebrate a birthday	I always use the Crowne Plaza St James when I stay in London due to it's great location - close enough to the centre of London, but far enough not to be too noisy. The staff are always welcoming and the rooms well presented. I recently celebrated a major birthday and put up a number of friends who all had a blast. Great being able to walk straight thru to Zanders cocktail bar and the brilliant Bank Westminster restaurant."
84,678,"Sep 25 2008 	Very nice hotel in good location	We stayed one night at Crowne Plaza Hotel, St James London for 1 night before catching our cruise. We thought the hotel was very nice. Our flight arrived early from the US and got to the hotel around 11am. The only bad thing was that we weren't able to check in untill around 2pm and we were all exhusted. We had drinks out in the Garden which was beautifull, then when it started raining we went inside the little lobby bar. Drinks were not cheap. The Rooms we had were both nice and I had heard horror stories about if you book priceline, hotwire etc you get the worse rooms. We'll we had two rooms and both were lovely. The first room had two single beds and the second had 1 queen. One room was in a different building and the lift was tiny. I think 3 people was the most it would fit.. without bags. Overall we had a good time at a nice hotel.One thing I would caution against is trying to take cruise luggage from gatwick to London on the train. We had to stand holding all our bags with all the business folks trying to get on and off. It was quite a hassle. Next time I'll try something else. We also took the train from London to Dover with much better results because the train was not full. We couldn't find anyplace to put the bags so luckily we found 4 empty seats and pilled them up.On a side note we went to a little pub called &quot; Alberts&quot; within walking distance of the Crowne Plaza and had drinks and food. It was lot of fun. It was a busy place on a week night and we sat at these little tables with little stools. It was fun with good food and good prices for food and drinks."
85,678,"Sep 25 2008 	Just Terrible	My wife and I travel to London and stay in the city two  three times per year. We love the central / convenient location of the Crown Plaza, St. James and have had a number of positive experiences over the past 5 -6 years. This past visit, (22  24 September), however, was absolutely terrible.The problems began at check-in: - two very inexperienced young women (with no apparent supervision) at the check-in desk- our room (booked on their internet site) only had a double sized bed; despite the fact that the internet site referenced a queen sized bed- when we complained about the size of the bed and the mis-representation of the internet description, the front desk clerk told us this happens all the time with Americans (!!)- we were then moved to a room with two double beds pushed together (room 229)- while larger, this room was old, in a terrible state of repair (cracked tile, door), was very dirty (carpets stained, odd stains on the walls), was positioned on the property such that we couldnt log on to the internet, was hot (and the air conditioning didnt work)- daily newspapers we ordered at check in didnt arrive- complementary water bottle in room was already opened (creepy) - on day of departure, we discovered we were only provided ONE TOWEL (for two people) - in addition, on day of departure, the supervisor knocked repeatedly on our door asking when we were going to leave the hotel!!!- No member of the hotel staff was a native English speaker  which made communication difficult; and, I believe, was used by the hotel to avoid having to deal with our issues- (Conveniently) the front desk did not have any customer feedback forms; no customer feedback forms in the room either (surprise, surprise)- breakfast was incredibly expensive; poorly stocked; and as above, no member of staff spoke English  other than to ask repeatedly if wed completed their room charge form !!!Absolutely the worst visit weve ever had to a Crown Plaza property"
86,678,"Sep 18 2008 	Exceptional	My husband and I stayed at Crowne Plaza London St James in late April - early May of 2005. We were upgraded without requesting it after my husband told them this trip was a lifelong dream for me. Our room overlooked the courtyard and was clean and delightfully comfortable with a kingsize bed and luxurious bedding. The staff was friendly, polite and very helpful to us. The location couldn't have been better and the neighborhood was safe and quiet. We are making plans to visit London again in the near future and we won't even consider staying at any other hotel."
87,678,"Sep 11 2008 	Great but.........	We recently stayed at this hotel. It was a great location - we walked everywhere, Trafalgar Square, Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace, etc. My only complaint is that I had requested WEEKS AGO a room overlooking the courtyard. I received a e-mail confirmation from the Hotel granting the request yet, when we checked in, our room overlooked the air conditioning units. Pretty disappointing. All in all, it was a very nice experience."
88,678,"Aug 13 2008 	Excellent stay again	Stayed for the second time at this hotel and was once again impressed with everything. The hotel is very grand and styled as one would expect from a traditional London hotel.Great location, impressive attitude from all staff, polite and helpful at every opportunity.Upgraded to a suite which was lovely, only dissapointment was that we only stayed one night on this occasion."
89,678,"Aug 11 2008	Perfect London Location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza St James for our 30th anniversary. The location is ideal for walking to everything - a block or two to Buckingham Palace. Walked the few blocks to the theatre and Victoria station. The taxi stand just outside was handy. It's a busy area but quiet. I think a police station is in the neighborhood. Our room was clean and cool and comfortable overlooking the courtyard. Loved having tea in the courtyard. Enjoyed the two restaurants and a pub down the street. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - wish they had a coffee shop or continental breakfast. We enjoyed nightly drinks in the bar area, often listening to live piano. The staff were friendly and helpful. For a special once in a lifetime trip our stay was perfect!"
90,678,"Jul 27 2008 	Outstanding hotel	Our third stay at this splendid 4 star hotel . Decor ,service, food and standard bed rooms of the highest possible order. Without asking we were upgraded to a mini suite...so luxurious. Spotless throughout and so very clean, this wonderful hotel boasts first class restaurants and a fabulous garden terrace eating area. Why only 4 stars.? The standard bedroms alone are better than some 5 star hotels. Location perfect for Buckingham Palace, the Royal Parks and the West End. You will not do better in London. And we are SO difficult to please."
91,678,"Jul 27 2008 	Five stars!?! More like 3 stars...	We booked a king bed for a five night stay in early July. After a 12 hour journey and upon arrival they said they had lost that reservation request (even though I had confirmed by email a week before arriving) and gave us an unrenovated, tiny, dingy room. We were very unimpessed with the decor and cleanliness of the room. For example the carpets were dirty and the bathroom was in need of a major cleaning and overhaul. There was black mold growing in the grout of the shower and the walls were dingy and dirty. We travel a lot and there is no way that the room we were given was a five star room, perhaps a 3 star, but definitely not a 4 or 5 star.The few positives were the location to Buckingham Palace and the tube was a very short walk away.Nevertheless, we will not be back to the Crowne Plaza St. James."
92,678,"Jul 26 2008 	Wouldn't go back	England is very expensive, still the quality of this hotel was below the worth of its price. The entry way was lovely, elegant and spacious. The white gloved doorman looked and handled everything superbly. The room and hallways were dirty, and worn. The carpet edges werent vacuumed very much at it seems. The food from room service was not very good at all. Our view was that of a barbed wire fence protecting a school It was very close to Buckingham Palace, and easy to get a taxi, but that was about the best of it. It was overpriced even at England's rates."
93,678,"Jul 21 2008 	Beautiful room	We booked this hotel at the last minute in order to attend a garden party at Buckingham Palace, for which it is ideally located, being only a few minutes' walk away from the front gates. The room we were given was fantastic- huge (by London standards) and well equipped. Although some of the staff were a little disorganised at times, this was more than compensated for by the concierge Frederic, whom we found to be extremely helpful and full of useful tips. Location is excellent, being within easy walking distance of many of the major tourist attractions, and a few hundred metres from St James' Park tube station for access to the rest. My only quibble was with the price- OK, London hotels are expensive, but for the money we paid, I would at least have expected breakfast to be included."
94,678,"Jul 16 2008 	Grand but outdated	Stayed here for business for one night. 180 (inc VAT) per night - higher rate than normal due to Farnborough Air show being on and hotels in short supply.Very grand and old england on outside and in reception. Room was of a good size, but it was hot and the aircon didn't seem to do anything. Too noisy to have the window open.Varied choice of breakfast in the room - Japanese, healthy, full and continental.Convenient for Victoria, St James Park (and tube), Buckingham palace, The Eye, Big Ben, Westminster, Houses of Parliament etcBed was very comfy"
95,678,"Jul 6 2008 	Good Hotel - very convnient	I booked our one night stay at the St. James through Priceline and without knowing which 3-star hotel we're getting, we got a room at St. James for $150! The hotel is conveniently located near Victoria Station where you can catch the Heathrow Express. Buckingham Palace, Parliament and Westminster Abbey was also only a walking distance away. Our room was comfortable and clean. The staff was helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again."
96,678,"Jul 5 2008 	Great Location - Acceptable Hotel - Sub Par Housekeeping	Crowne Plaza London St. James We stayed at the Crowne Plaza London St. James for a five nights in London. This trip was part of a 15 night trip to Europe. The booking at this location was on a Priority Club reward stay. We booked a single double bed non-smoking room, and due to my Priority Club Platinum status, they said we were upgraded to a King non-smoking room on the fifth floor.  We arrived in London via high speed train from Paris, and the taxi ride to the hotel was quick and easy, running about 18 pounds, but there was heavy traffic. We did not want to take the tube (and the associated stairs) with our luggage. The hotel has a comfortable lobby, restaurant, and bar. They have piano music in the lobby some evenings. Check in was quick, easy, though they did not have our room available till after 3:30pm. (No complaints there.check in was not till 4  we just visited Buckingham and got some lunch at Piccadilly area. Other than a free newspaper and the slight room upgrade there were no perks for Platinum members (Priority Club's highest) which was a bit of a disappointment, BUT the location of the hotel more than made up for that!  The hotel is approximately 5 minute walk to Buckingham and Victoria station. Trafalgar Square and Westminster Abbey, and Parliament is about 10 minutes, London Eye and Piccadilly were about a 15 minute walk. Other than going to Harrods and Covent Gardens, we had no reason to use the tube, bus or taxis, fortunately, as these are very expensive in London.  The room was rather large by Europe standards. The hotel itself is very old, and was formerly a hospital. The floors are a bit uneven and the hallways wind around in strange patterns, but overall that adds to the character. I believe parts of the structure date to the late 1800's / early 1900's. In my opinion this gives the hotel neat character of old London. The bed was very comfortable. It was not a true king, but rather two beds zippered together and made up as a king. I did not however find this to be any problem and. The blow-dryer on the wall in the bathroom is old and difficult to use but they brought us a portable one. The rooms had robes for guest use. The carpet was rather worn and in need of replacement as was the furniture in the room. (Designed to look old, but of particle board and it has seen its better days.) The TV was excellent with flat panel HD. Oddly enough, other than the TV, there is no clock or radio in the room. The air conditioning was excellent. The view from the room was of another apartment in the same complex, but did make for a very quiet stay which was greatly appreciated.  Housekeeping staff was spotty at best. On several occasions, soiled glasses were left in the room, tea bags not replaced, bed short sheeted, did not leave towels, etc. All of these were minor and easily rectified with a call to housekeeping, but it should not be necessary to call. (I tipped the housekeepers daily, which makes the spotty service worse.) Internet access is excessive at 30 pence per minute. Do yourself a favor and walk 5 minutes to the internet caf by Victoria station for 1 Pound per hour.  They have a gym that is available to all guests as well as a business center. We never actually went down to the gym as we were doing enough walking to stay fit.  The concierge staff and bell staff was acceptable but nothing special. We did not eat or drink at the hotel at all so can not comment on those services.  If the hotel got their housekeeping act together it would be phenomenal. The central location makes up for any lack of other amenities and I would highly recommend this hotel to others."
97,678,"Jun 8 2008 	Nice but not special!	I stayed here with husband and another couple of our friends last night. One of whom travels for work so we only paid 112. for 2 Deluxe rooms one night, not including breakfast. As I mentioned we had the deluxe room (604), the walk in price of this room is 350 a night. All I can say is that if I had paid that sort of price I would have been disappointed. The room was a great size with a really comfortable king size bed but it was a bit tired especially the bathroom. The shower was rubbish and I chose to use the one in the spa the following morning!!! The towels in the bathroom were really hard too! Internet was 30p a minute which I thought was a bit steep.As someone else mentioned the mini bar is extortionate, as is breakfast. Room service Continental was 18.00 and a cooked breakfast was 25.00. We didn't bother!Only one lift working as one is being renovated so it was really slow.The bar was nice we sat out on the terrace and had a drink while waiting for our rooms. I had a glass of Aussie Chardonnay for 5.80. The service was great on both visits to the bar.I had a nice night at this hotel, I had a a lovely visit to the spa and pampered myself with the Molton Brown products.We were kept waiting for an hour and a half for our rooms, and the knock on effect was that we were unable to change before going to the Theatre which wasn't great.I would go again, but only if it cost 60.00."
98,678,"May 28 2008 	excellent hotel	Stayed at this hotel in mid-May for 3 nights and I have to say I will go back in a heart beat. Check in was quick and easy (within 2 mins) and had room #778. This room is clean and decent sized compared to other hotels in London, lots of room or you may call it under-furnished. The view was to the garden and it's quiet. All staff was egar to help. Lined up at the concierge and you get someone's attention within 15 seconds. The bar (Hampton's) was tiny but good. Location is great, within 3 mins walk to Buckingham Palace, 10 mins to Victoria, and 15 mins to Trafagar. We even walked from London Eye back to the hotel and it took 20 mins or less. Most attrations are within walking distance if walking is your thing. Now, the not so good. The hotel is big and took me a while to find my room, pratically took me 10 mins. Room service and mini-bar are expensive; elevators are slow, and the bathroom is the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. All in all, yes, very nice hotel. Best part was I redeemed points to stay there for free."
99,678,"May 28 2008 	Looks posher on the outside....	Chosen for the location as we needed to be at Birdcage walk for 830 am wouldn't stay at this place again. The front and lobby looked like a 4 star hotel. The smell and the size of the fresh flower bouquet was lovely.As soon as you get to the 3rd floor were we stayed, as soon as you step out of the lift, the new carpet doesn't quite meet the old that was still there. As gaffer tape was fixed on the edge where at least a foot of the new carpet wasn't big enough. Not quite 4 star!!The bedroom was quite clean. The bathroom was tired with a cracked fitted worktop around the sink. And the screwed in board behind the toilet needed a good clean round the gap. The cost of the mini bar was shocking!!! 6.30 for a 50ml bottle of vodka and 3.80 for a 275ml can of coke. Seems alot to me. The breakfast (that we didn't have) was far too expensive it was about 4 times the price in a nice cafe. Overall the room was noisy from the outside, which you would expect but the room next door was noisy.We decided on our first night to have a drink after we had had a busy day. So we went outside and sat down at a table where we waited and waited for ten minutes before we gave up even thought the waiters saw us!!!I would rather save my money and stay at an Easyhotel. Which we would have done if they had been in our location."
100,678,"May 28 2008 	Great location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights and had 2 rooms (4 adults). Our room was situated on the 5th floor and although small was clean and well presented. Generally the decor was in good order although a few may nit pick such as carpet a bit threadbare in places, the odd missing handle from a cabinet etc. The lobby was very grand and the restaurants are expensive however good quality food. For breakfast there is a restaurant just outside the hotel called Bon Gusto and I would recommend going there as it's very reasonably priced. All in all the hotel was clean, the staff were courteous and polite and I would stay here again. The location is the best part as it's in Buckingham Gate so the palace is about 5 mins walk. The nearest tube is St James Park which is about a 4 minute walk and again as it's on the district/circle line, great location. The only negatives was that I was woken at 5am (I am generally a heavy sleeper) on the last night by what sounded like the air conditioning units outside being switched on and it just sounded like a car revving continually so I wasn't able to get back to sleep for a couple of hours. Also the beds were too soft for my liking which resulted in back ache in the morning and my friend's bed had a wheel missing from the bottom!!"
101,678,"May 28 2008 	Traditional British Hotel	I booked a standard room with breakfast on the hotel website for 95, which was excellent value for London, and because of my Priority Club status got upgraded to a larger room, which had two single beds side by side. As other reviewers have suggested, the hotel consists of four buildings, which were obviosuly built as apartment blocks, but which have now been combined into one hotel. My room was in the block with the spa, which is furthest from reception. The receptionist directed me to the room via the lift in the entrance building from which it was a very long walk along several corridors to my room. I discovered that there was another lift just outside my room which took me to the ground floor from where reception could be reached siply by walking across the courtyard. The room itself was very comfortable and spacious. There was a desk with a chair as well as a coffee table with two easy chairs. The bathroom was not large, but adequate, and the air coniditioning in the room worked very well. Bad points were that the curtains were set so far in front of the wall that they let in a lot of light and the lights were set up such that whilst the bedside lights could be used by themsleves, the standard lamp near the coffee table only worked if the main ceiling lights were on. The breakfast was adequate. I wasn't offered toast and the selection was rather limited for a Crowne Plaza. No real complaints, just a few niggles, so I would use this hotel again."
102,678,"May 26 2008 	In spite of all its faults I like this hotel	I have stayed here a fair bit and have put in mixed reviews over the years - but I always come back. Sure occasionally I have had a scruffy tiny room, the service has sometimes been poor and I have been crowded out by package tourists but I always return and here's why.The hotel has buckets of character and is charming, it is in a central part of London but the area is quiet, there are good pubs and restaurants nearby, and the tube (St James' Park) is close. I like the Bank bar restaurant which is next door and the hotel's enclosed garden can be delightful on a fine day.All London hotels are overpriced but until this Crowne Plaza upsets me 'big time', I shall keep coming back while I can still afford it."
103,678,"May 23 2008	Good location - close to Buckingham Palace	I stayed two nights at the Crowne Plaza prior to business meetings outside the city. The location was perfect for exploring the city. Good walking location  close to Buckingham Palace and the sites and the tube. The room was ok sized, clean, and overlooked the courtyard which was beautiful. The hotel rooms/halls seem a little old but clean. It was extremely busy hotel but the staff were always polite and tried to help. The restaurant wasnt anything special but convenient. Id recommend try something offsite for lunch/dinner for better value and taste. If you take a taxi to the hotel be advised its in a congestion zoneI believe you incur an extra fee for drop off? Not really sure what that was about. Overall it was a pleasant first trip to England and enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza."
104,678,"May 18 2008 	Good location but a tired looking hotel	Have stayed here before, and stayed in the annex - which was a better room than this time - 359 in the main hotel.This room felt small for a 4* hotel, and was tired looking - small bathroom.Other reviews say about only one working lift, which is still the issue, and although there is a sign saying the lift is being worked on, there's no sign of when it's going to be sorted. The location is great - 10 minutes from Victoria station, and near Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament etc and local bars and restaurants.Would suggest stock up the mini-bar with goodies from the local sainsburys rather than pay the hotels rates for water, coke, chocolate etc!More a good 3* hotel than 4*!"
105,678,"May 11 2008 	Initially not impressed	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza last weekend, booked two rooms in February. When we checked in - (two couples - me and my sister and our partners) there was quite a delay, in the end we were allocated our rooms, one in the hotel and one in the neighbouring building. Not acceptable we had booked together and wanted to stay together, after about 45 minutes we were offered an upgrade to a two bedroom suite after the receptionist admitted that they had overbooked, and this was common practice. The suite was not that good but we had little time to spare so just sort of accepted it. On our way out the doorman asked if we were OK, we said &quot;no not really&quot; and explained our situation, told him we had been upgraded and he said &quot;no&quot; this is not a luxury suite. We knew this because the carpets were worn and grubby, the throws were stained and the spare loo did not flush. He spoke to the hotel and they contacted me, an apology was given and we were told we would be given another room if we could come back and move our belongings, we were pushed for time so I agreed to see her at 8.00pm. Wow, we were given a new suite. Three double bedrooms, kitchen diner, and a massive lounge. It was lovely, two beds were en-suite and there was a third massive bathroom. Although it was a poor start we enjoyed our stay, some of the staff were amazing. We paid 350 per night but the suite we got was far more expensive than that. I would stay there again because the location is fantastic, but I would inspect the room before accepting it."
106,678,"May 10 2008 	Nice but not outstanding	Booked via travel agent in Melbourne Australia AUD$300 a night with breakfastStay Fri May 2nd for 4 nightsRoom 254 ( my Mum was in 260)Our room was on a corner so gave us more space than my Mum's, but we had no view, where as she looked over the lovely courtyard.Neither room had a chair to sit on except the desk one.A small double bed, which I felt was strange given our room size was good.For the price paid I expect internet access to be included. It was charged at GBP 14.99 from noon till noon.Wasn't impressed with buffet breakfast. Range wasnt great, mostly lukewarm. It wasnt until our final day I noticed someone had requested poached eggs, something we were not made aware of. Toast needed to be ordered aswell and although a good serving was given, ends up being cold, rather than just cooking what you need when you need it.Service in food and beverage areas wasnt overly good or helpful. Although front desk and bell desk were fine.Food was overpriced even for London hotel standards. AUD $50 for an omlette and bread. There is a sainsburys around the corner, stock up on drinks, fruit if your on a budget.Renovations were going on during our stay and there was only one lift working, which leads to long waits. There are stairs on one end of the hall although it is not marked.Overall dissappointed, had very good experiences with this chain in other parts of the world."
107,678,"Apr 23 2008 	best hotel best service	My wife and I haved stayed at this wonderful hotel twice, we loved it the first time and loved it even more the second time round. The hotel's staff were extremely helpful and always polite, if you had any looked of confusion on your face they were quick to respond and offered a helping hand. It was very nice to have the hotel located in the middle of everything, we could walk to most of our destination spots and if any were too far away, the tube was a minutes walk from the hotel. I enjoyed using the gym facilities and incredible meals...the breakfasts were astounding and plentiful and the dinners exquisite. The price per night was an incredible bargain and you definitely get MORE than you pay for, I checked my email a few times and that was pretty costly(honestly, the only downfall of the hotel but, you're on vacation you needn't check your email...LOL!) I plan on visiting Engand every other year and look forward to staying at The Crown Plaza St. James every time. Good job to the hotel and its staff...well done! -Chris"
108,678,"Apr 17 2008 	Treated like royalty!	My boyfriend and I recently went to London as a last minute trip and we booked this hotel through priceline.com. We got a great deal and I would highly recommend that site to travelers as well! Neither of us knew what to expect upon arrival and were very pleased with our booking when we arrived. The staff was extremely helpful with not only check-in, but helping us identify where all the major tourist sites were in relation to the hotel. The hotel is situated a short walk from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament and tons of restaurants! (Try the Bag o Nails for their fish and chips with mashed peas! It was so good that we went there twice!) They provided us with maps and even advised which bus/tube we should take to get around town. The room we stayed in was not in the main building. It was across the courtyard in the building with the Spa. It has a separate entrance than the main hotel and the lavender aroma of the spa was warm and welcoming. The elevator up to the 8th floor is extremely small! It fits 2 people comfortably. However, add luggage and an escort to your room and its a tight squeeze! Im sure it would have been hysterical to watch 3 grown people and luggage trying to get in and out of the tiny tiny box! We were in room 879 which was non-smoking and very large! In my experience traveling Europe I have encountered many rooms that place 2 twin beds together to make a king. That was not the case here. It was an actual king bed with lots of pillows and a down comforter under the bedspread. The bathroom was exceptionally nice, and clean, with a hot towel rack and roomy shower. This room was great except for the fact that the window was blocked by the outdoor clock so we could not see the view of the courtyard. So if this is a concern to you I would recommend another room. Upon departure from the hotel to the airport I was a little disappointed with the help, or rather lack there of, they provided in helping us find an efficient way to the airport. Apparently there are 4 different ways to get to the airport from the hotel and we were only provided with 2 - taxi and tube. After seeing a bus stop, hours before departure, advertising a shuttle for more than  the price of the taxi, I was very disappointed. You need to book the shuttle 24 hours in advance. The final option of getting to the airport was by bus; we were not advised of this either until I complained to the manager about it. They became rude and said that it was not their staffs fault for not providing all the information, but rather us for not asking the right questions to obtain this information. It didnt and still does not make sense to me. Overall, it was a good experience and I would stay there again. Just be wise to their different means of transportation!"
109,678,"Apr 16 2008 	Superb location	Close to Buckingham Palace and St James' Park, the Crowne Plaza is an elegant hotel within easy walking distance of St James' tube station and Victoria rail station. The rooms are large and have lots of nice little touches - small dark chocolates, kettle and tea making facilities, and free bottles of mineral water. The fitness centre has good facilities and power showers. My only gripe is that the lifts seem to be in a permanent state of upgrade - in the six months since my last visit one has been renewed and the other is out of service."
110,678,"Apr 15 2008	Fantastic	I stayed there last year with my mum, it was the first time id been to London over night and it couldn't have been better. From the moment we arrived the staff were falling over themselves trying to help. They were so polite and professional. Our Room was amazing we got a delux suite, it was like a little flat within the hotel with complimentary fruit bowl and drinks when we got there.We didn't eat in the hotel instead we went into London to J Sheakeys which is a restaurant all to itself. On leaving for the restaurant, the concierge proved to be extremely knowledgable not just about the local area but everywherer we needed to be in London. The next day he also proved his worth by remembering our names and faces as well as what we had done the previous night. Even simple things like that can improve your stay.I would advise anyone going to london to stay there one of the best hotels i have stayed in in this country."
111,678,"Apr 12 2008 	A default hotel	This place is OK. Thats about all I can write about it. Nothing was wrong but there also wasn't anything spectacular. I was only here for one night on business and booked the place since my first meeting on the second day was a couple doors down. I've been at many Crowne Plazas and this one is basically average. The only disappoint was the cost of Internet access but this is a problem in so many places. I found the location ok as well but I wouldn't stay here were my meeting not in the area. I prefer other parts of town in London. In summary, this is a good business hotel and you can expect what you are used to if you've been to other Crowne Plazas."
112,678,"Apr 10 2008 	London for a week	My wife stayed here for a week in 2007-January. We too enjoyed the location, close to Victoria STation, walking to tube station,close to Waterloo etc. I grew up in England so very aware of getting around and know the West End.The rooms were clean for most part, but did have some issueswith the bedspreads. While the rooms were not huge by American standards I thought adequate for Europe. Bathroomswere clean and in good condtion. (I travel for a living and consider myself a critique of hotels).We visited all the restaurants and most were decent in terms of price and quality.Many amenities in the hotel, spa, exercise, concierge and of course meals.We stayed on points but if had to pay would rate average for London as opposed to comments that is a poor value. The staff in general was pleasant. I would stay there again."
113,678,"Apr 7 2008 	Great experience!	We got a great rate on flight and hotel on our recent trip to London (our first trip there). The Crowne Plaza St. James was in a terrific location just down the street from Buckingham Palace and very close to the St. James Underground station. We bought two Oyster cards and traveled everywhere with great ease on the tube--wish we had the Undergroud here in Vegas! With the pound being so strong vs. the dollar, it was wonderful to have daily breakfast included at no extra charge. The wait staff proved attentive and the food was apparently the typical English breakfast of eggs, sausage, potato cakes, beans and mushrooms served buffet style (we had exactly the same meal at Heathrow before we left). Danish, croissants, fresh fruit, and fruit salads completed the meals with all the fresh juice and good coffee we wanted.Now, a few negatives: Only one elevator was running when we were at the hotel--not a big deal for us during the week, but we did notice longer wait times on the weekend. Our room was big enough for the two of us, but the carpet in the room was a bit worn and tattered. Also, you have to keep the bathroom door closed or the steam will set off the fire alarm--didn't happen to us, but we heard alarms periodically during our stay.On the plus side, the bathroom was large, had lots of marble and had handy features like a towel heater, a 110v outlet for shavers (or cell phones) and a no-fog mirror. An iron, ironing board and clothes press / butler were all in the closet with a safe and small refrigerator.All in all, we liked our stay at the Crowne Plaza and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a bit more space with a trade off of not being in quite as new a property as some might like."
114,678,"Mar 31 2008 	An absolutely wonderful experince.	I was fortunate enough to be able to stay at this superb hotel for 2 months whilst in London on business. The rooms are beautiful, the decor, the character but what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. They cannot do enough for you and they are so genuine. It isn't fake like at so many other hotels. Thank you all the staff at the Crowne Plaza St. James! I won't name names because there are just too many I wish to thank.As for the rest of the review, 60 seconds walk to St James tube, taxi's right outside the door charging approx. 5 to Piccadilly Circus / Leicester Square / Covent Garden. I walked to Picadilly Circus crossing St James Park, The Mall and up lower regent street in about 15 mins. 15 mins walking in other direction takes you to London eye, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and the houses of Parliament. Could you be any more central?Just behind the hotel you have Victoria shopping centre where you will find Nandos, Zizzi, Wagamama, Ha Ha's restaurants also Pizza Express and some great pub food are a stone throw away if you don't fancy any of the three restaurants within the hotel.I previously stayed at the five star Le Meridian Picadilly and these two are classes apart. I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza St. James. Well done and Thanks CP!"
115,678,"Mar 27 2008 	Average	If you can get a decent deal, and get King Bed Room, this place is OK.Its location is not great, a fair walk from the tube or buses. No decent restaurants nearby.Its decor is tired."
116,678,"Mar 25 2008 	Loved the location!	My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza St. James for a week and loved it. The hotel is on a road that leads to Buckingham Palace in a short 5 minute walk. The hotel is also within walking distance of Big Ben, Parliament, and Westminster Abbey. It is in a safe and nice location. The hotel staff were friendly, and the room was clean and spacious by European standards. The marble bathroom had a heated towel rack. Our vacation package included the fabulous breakfast buffet that had a wide assortment of hot and cold food. The St. James tube stop is a short distance away from the hotel, a less than 5 minute walk, which made it very easy to get around the city. We would definitely stay at this hotel again!"
117,678,"Mar 19 2008 	Nice place - good locatuion.	Very close to Buckingham palace and convenient for the City attractions, Westminster abbey and so on, although probably not the best location for restaurants etc (later in the evening.)Very nice, peaceful first impression, and check in staff very friendly.The elavators are a bit on short supply, and yes, the bedrooms are not that big - but all perfectly comfortable and adequate.Room service efficient, maintenance a bit slow - we were just there for 2 nights and left with a good impession overall."
118,678,"Mar 5 2008	Lovely hotel tastefully decorated great staff and excellent restaurants!	I have a long experience of staying at the Crowne Plaza and using both its restaurants, Bistro 51 and Quilon. The hotel is so tastefully decorated and the food is delicious in both restaurants, with Quilon offering some of the more refined Indian Cuisine in town, while Bistro 51 provides a gastronomic and varied Continental menu.The staff are always very helpful which only makes each experience in that hotel more enjoyable.One of the finest places to dine and sleep in London."
119,678,"Feb 26 2008	Great for a weekend break	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break in London. The check in was quick and as we had minimal luggage were left to find our own way to room. We had booked a standard room which was adequate in size although not large. We had a pleasant view of the court yard garden and fountain from our two little balconies. The room had everything we needed and was clean and well furnished, although the general style of the room is a little dated we hadn't come to london to stare at the interior of our hotel room. We found it to be convenient for both St James Park tube station and Victoria Station, which made getting around London very easy. We did not dine in the hotel at all, but found the pub at the end of the road did an excellent breakfast for 4.99! I would not pay top price for this hotel but if you spot a good deal then I would go for it."
120,678,"Feb 25 2008	Torn bedding!!! Not good value	Poor value, even for London.I only stay here occasionally on &quot;miles&quot; points- this hotel is poor value and is never worth paying the list price. I feel sorry for tourists shafted by this hotel.Rooms are dated, adequate but dated. Biggest disappointment is finding small stains on sheets and two not insignificant holes in the bed covers. There is NO WAY these holes could have been overlooked - which means the staff knowingly fitted a torn bedspread to the bed. This says a lot about the standards of this hotel.Reception can be busy at times, not just 8AM Friday, but busy in the evenings too.After a night at the theatre we stopped in the bar one night and the barman was excellent entertaining the kids by talking about cocktails and making them both a special cocktail according to their requests - this guy was great - thanks. (When I got the bill discovered the 4 drinks cost us nearly 20 though!)Adequate, but poor value for money and decor and linen desperately needs updating. I get better quality linen in the 45/night hotels and guesthouses I often stay at in London."
121,678,"Feb 22 2008	Fantastic room and service	I took my wife here for a birthday present to watch the Phantom of the Opera, the Kings Deluxe apartment had everything we needed it was a shame we where only staying one night as I could of easily stayed the week.Location was excellent as Buckingham Palace was just around the corner and easy walk to the Her Majesty's Theatre and Piccadilly Circus.We both had breakfast in the morning which was of a buffet style and good enough quality so was not let down before heading home."
122,678,"Jan 9 2008 	a hotel in a fantastic location	This hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the sites of London, just a 10 minute walk away from Buckingham Palace and Hyde ParkThe rooms were clean and to an average standard, however the reception staff were excellent and couldnt do enough to helpOn the day of arrival and the day of departure they stored our luggage free of charge outside of the times where we didnt have a room and this was no problem which meant we could spend a full day exploring the sites the day we cheked out with no baggage to carry roundWould definitely consider staying here again"
123,678,"Jan 5 2008 	Great first impression but the rooms let it down!	Why do IHG continue to allow the Crowne Plaza brand to be de-valued by poor properties. I have recently stayed at Crowne Plaza properties in Birmingham, London and Leeds, and all have been poor.The Crowne Plaza St James, as other reviews have said, looks great. Reception is lovely, as is the general front of house area. However once you get past reception you are left in little doubt that the hotel needs a fair amount of money spending on it.Like the Crowne Plaza in Birmingham this hotel is stuck in the 70's. The rooms are poorly furnished by modern standards, and the bathrooms are very dated. Our room was very cold due to poor in-room heating (a thermostat with do indication of what was hot or cold did not help this), and single glazed windows. The bedding had some interesting stains, and generally looked very old.Overall, it did the job of being a bed for the night, but I would not class this property any better than 3 star. Invest some money and it has great potential, but at the moment it is just another old London hotel - over-priced and in need of refurbishment."
124,678,"Dec 29 2007 	Enjoyable stay at The St James	Stayed here just after Xmas with my daughter to see a show and also do some sale shopping.We were upgraded to an exec room which although dated was large by London standards and was clean and adequate for our needs.The hotel staff were very attentive and willing to help and also took good care of us at breakfast.The location is great for the palace, london eye, Big Ben etc etc and only a five minute walk from the tube station.Lack of evening eateries in the surrounding area is the only drawback but plenty of cafes etc during the day for lunch and the hotel does have three resturants attached to it but all rather expensive.All in all a good hotel with good staff and no complaints."
125,678,"Dec 26 2007 	Average Hotel with Average Location	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza London, St. James between November 16, 2007 and November 24, 2007. The hotel staff was polite but never went out of their way for us. Everything was quite serviceable but nothing special or extraordinary.This was our first stay in London and it would have taken a lot to detract from our trip. In the title I mention that the location was average. I say this because after business people leave the area and on the weekends, this part of town is mostly deserted. We would prefer staying in a livelier area next time.Being about 1/3 of a mile from Buckingham Palace was nice and we were also within walking distance of Parliament, Green Park, Westminster Abbey, and a great many other attractions.I am pleased that we booked our hotel/airfare with AAA. They took care of details such as transport from/to the airport (Gatwick) which was nice. As this was our first international trip, we felt more secure using their service.Overall, I am not displeased with where we stayed. However, knowing now what I do about the great city of London, I would likely stay in the Piccadilly Circus area or maybe closer to the British Museum.We loved the trip so much that we are considering returning in 2008 - probably in the summer. When we return we plan to see a great deal more of the country and particularly look forward to visiting the Cotswalds."
126,678,"Dec 25 2007 	Not great for the price.	This hotel was part of a package deal with a local travel agent. We had two twin rooms for 1 night. Overall a very poor experience. All glitz and glamour in the downstairs lobby and restaurants, but shabby upstairs in the rooms and hallways.We requested non smoking rooms, but one of the rooms had obviously been a smoking room . We asked housekeeping to freshen the room while we were at dinner, on our return the room had been sprayed with air freshener (but not cleaned), so we had the awful smell of air freshener and cigarette smoke. When we requested another room it took almost an hour for the transfer (there was only approx 50% occupancy according to the porter) which at 11pm was not great.We ending up moving floors and wings...... with a very inadequate lift service this was frustrating after waiting so long.We found the breakfast well below average, we had to stand outside the breakfast room to wait for an available table, the 'hot' buffet was tepid, and the rest uninspiring .... for a 4* hotel this one just does not live to any expectation.The only positives were the location and the doormen."
127,678,"Dec 18 2007 	Needs Renovating	Other reviewers are correct.When you arrive, you are impressed by the numerous liveried doormen, etc. hovering around the well-presented reception area.But head upstairs and you're walking on threadbare carpets and the rooms are dated in terms of furniture and decor. Loose door handles give a poor impression. The bathroom sink units look OK, but the bath area is very old. Water pressure was OK, hot water was always very hot. Heated towel rail was a nice feature too. Bathroom had frosted glass windows so got natural light, but at night, the absence of curtains/blinds, meant that outside lighting shown through.Breakfast was included in my rate. This was OK, but the buffet offered less than half of the selection of the lower-level Holiday Inn chain.If you can get a discounted rate, then well done. The location is very good (St James's tube is closer than Victoria). But otherwise, there are much better all-round hotels elsewhere in London."
128,678,"Dec 9 2007 	Tired hotel in need of renovation	I spent four nights in this hotel in December. The building itself and the reception area are very impressive. However, once you go upstairs to your room it is such a let down. The carpets and walls are shabby in the public areas and also the rooms. The carpet in my room had a large cigerette burn. Windows do not shut properly. This is not what you would expect for a four star property. This is so dissapionting as the building is a really impressive and old and so much more could be done with it as is demonstrated by the impressive lobby.Food is also very pricey. I suppose this is because the restaurants are pretty good and draw in people who are not staying there. However if you are actually staying there in your shabby room you just feel this is just another way to get even more money out of you.Service is fine for a four star.If they refurbished the place I would not hesitate to go back."
129,678,"Dec 7 2007	Dirty Rude Terrible Service Not safe	This was a horrible, traumatic experience. It was pre-paid so we could not leave. Our first room option had dirty floors, walls and dusty furniture. The 2nd room was not much better. Our reservations were changed without our permission. When we contacted the front desk with our problems, they became very rude to us, and this attitude continued. At the morning buffet the plate on the top of the pile had never been washed. It was slimy with egg and sausage. I was told this was no big deal by management. We were not provided toilet paper and kleenix. Indeed, we had to argue to get it. From the first day, our personal items and paperwork were tampered with. I had to call the credit card companies to have my cards cancelled and changed. Even written complaints were handled with disinterest. We did not feel safe here. Americans were especially poorly treated."
130,678,"Dec 3 2007 	Nice place to stay - good food excellent service	I was working in London and had booked this hotel as it was near the venue. Nearly cancelled after reading the previous reviews. I am really glad I didn't.The hotel is a short walk from St James tube station, five minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and the parks and 10 -15 minutes to Westminster and Big Ben. A friendly welcome at the door and at check-in. The process was quick and easy and the reception staff polite and friendly. The standard room and large bathroom were very clean and comfortable. The towels and bathrobes were soft and fuffyWe ate at the bistro, the food and wine were great ,the service excellent and the puddings amazing. The breakfast buffet was very good. Lovely swiss museli, fresh fruits, and assort ment of packet cereals, yogurts and fresh juices, a hot selection of breakfast fayre, cold meats and cheeses. Eggs to order and hot toast. Fresh pastries, bread rolls and muffins. Everyone seem to enjoy. Service was again excellent. Every member of staff we encountered was pleasant and polite."
131,678,"Nov 28 2007 	delusions of grandeur	This might have been a great hotel once but its not much good now. The first room they fobbed us off with was cramped, dingy had a filthy carpet with a large hole in it. After I explained that this would not be suitable for accommodating livestock let alone human guests we were offered a better room which was about 50% bigger and had a carpet with only comparitively light soiling.Breakfast was pretty awful, we had to demand proper butter rather than 'spread' and cereal other than allbran or frosties which were sitting in large open bowls with people coughing over them. The 'hot' selection wasn't hot and the items were of mediocre quality. The orange or grapefruit juice was nice but available only in tiny glasses which was tiresome. Their rack rate is about 300 per night which you would have to be mentally deficient to pay, its worth about 75."
132,678,Nov 27 2007 	Service is Terrible	My family and I had two rooms here for three nights. The desk representatives were not friendly at all. The room was okay bed was a double but the bed was small compared to our full beds here. Shower was great. Not sure how this hotel gets a 4 star rating. The carpet and furniture needs to be replaced. We asked to switch to a room with a king or queen size bed the next day and they told us to leave our bags packed in the room and they would switch us. We arrived at the hotel around 5pm and went to get the key and they had not switched us. Alot of confusion at the desk the hotel was sold out and guests who thought they had reservations were getting frustrated and walking out. They finally switched us and our luggage was never moved it was still in the old room. Other than that the hotel is in the perfect location for seeing alot of the attractions. There is shops and a grocery store not far from the hotel. We even came across a street market with some good stuff. If you see the market there is a great fish and chips shop there. Overall ok hotel I definately would not pay the higher prices at this hotel.
133,678,"Nov 24 2007 	Tired and scruffy rooms	Very good location, but earlier reviews are right about small rooms, clean but worn out furnishings and tiny bathrooms that havent been renovated in a decade. The TV was a 20 year old Nokia box - people don't use these anymore in their homes!! This hotel has gone downmarket since the last time I stayed and am disappointed the Taj Group would preside over an establishment with such mediocre standards."
134,678,"Nov 22 2007 	Not Perfect But Still Leaves A Good Impression	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights after attending a symposium in Essex. Good location since it is near Buckingham Palace but a little far if you are thinking of West End and the London Eye. Laid back atmosphere in and out of the hotel. Rooms are on the average as expected of typical European hotels. Don't expect any good views from your room at this hotel. Buffet breakfast is available at the cafe from 6-11am serving traditional English fare. Old World charm evident in the lobby and the courtyard. Satisfied with the hospitality/service shown by the concierge, bell staff/porter, and most of the front desk personnel. Would recommend this hotel for those planning to stay in London. The Crowne Plaza is a reliable hotel brand."
135,678,"Nov 20 2007 	great location	We stayed here in July and found the location brilliant. the reception looked wonderful and the staff were helpful, but check in was very slow. When we got to our room we were quite disapointed that it didn't live up to the stabdard of the reception. It was quite a plain room and not a particularly high standard. The cost of the mini bar was ridiculous. Breakfast was nice the next morning though."
136,678,"Nov 14 2007 	Terrible Experience! DO NOT STAY HERE!	I won a bid with the popular online hotel bidding site to stay at the Crowne Plaza St. James, a decidedly pretentious hotel near Buckingham Palace. Unfortunately my flight from California was cancelled due to weather, so I arrived the next day of the reservation at 8 am.I sent the hotel an email informing them of my late arrival. Nonetheless, they rented out my room. Eventually at 2 pm, another room was found for me. Not only did the hotel credit manager, someone named Phillip, refuse to refund me for this room, but they rented the room twice in one night, and made me wait 6 hours for a room I had already paid for. So they delayed my London vacation even further.By the way, this is a rather tired hotel. The carpets are worn through. The furnishings in the room are unmatching rejects from some used furniture sale. The matress is worn into lumps. Do not plan on staying here if you are hoping for a honest first-class experience."
137,678,Nov 11 2007	Dissappointing for a 4star hotel	Spent a long time deciding where to stay in London-unfortunately or first choice was not avaliable and we ended up at the Crowne Plaza St James. Location was good for Westminster &amp; Victoria areas. Reception area was very nice but that's the good bit. We were allocated a room on the 7th floor which certainly did not live up to our expectations! It was very small &amp;looked out onto other parts of the hotel at the back .The bathroom looked 'tired' with dirty grout and cracked cornice.For the money we paid I expected more from a 4star hotel in London I would find it difficult to rate the room as 2star and would not recommend it.
138,678,"Nov 9 2007 	It's Not What It Used To Be	I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza London St. James many times over the years. I have happy memories of a staff that worked to find the best price and to ensure an enjoyable stay. As it grows in it's upscale demeanor, it becomes less and less accommodating and welcoming. The once-friendly desk staff has assumed a hauteur that is ridiculous.You've certainly heard of airlines that lose your luggage. This was the first time a hotel has misplaced my luggage. Having arrived in London on an overnight flight, I arrived at the hotel before a room was available. That was understandable. But when the room was available for check-in, they could not locate my luggage at the concierge desk, and they delivered the wrong luggage to my room. That certainly had me on edge. And the desk staff never once offered an apology.The complimentary coffee in the lobby for early-risers has disappeared. And at the current exchange rate, the breakfast buffet is obscenely expensive. Only someone on an expense account would consider paying that much for breakfast. A short walk down the street to Buon Gusto provides a &quot;full Engish&quot; for UK3.70.Except for the excellent location, I can no longer think of a reason to stay at the Crowne Plaza St. James. Especially at those prices."
139,678,"Nov 7 2007 	Oh boy what an adventure!	I've stayed at this hotel a few times in the past; each time the staff has been friendly and helpful. Upon check in late on a Friday night -- no guests were on line at the desk so I did not have to wait at all -- I asked for an upgrade and received one without question! That first night I was very tired and just stayed there, but the second night -- wow! I was laying in bed after a very long day sightseeing throughout London and was just about to fall asleep, when I heard a dripping sound from the sitting area. I got up to take a look and saw that the ceiling was leaking! Slowly at first, but then water started streaming through the ceiling in this area, plus through the light fixtures in the bathroom and over the mini-bar by the closet -- it turns out there was a major water main break in the area above my room. Needless to say I was worried about damage to my belongings and even the possibility of an electrical fire. The staff took very good care of me; they asked me to wait in the bar downstairs and have a complimentary drink until they could find a place to put me, then they moved me across the courtyard to a luxury apartment. This could have been a disaster, but due to the actions of the staff everything ended up OK."
140,678,"Oct 29 2007 	Great location	This was a very good, centrally located hotel, very close to St. James tube station. Checking in and out very quick. Clean medium sized room but with slightly to spongy matress. Stayed Friday night and when checked in realised that room overlooked a school at the rear, a bit noisy during the day but obviously very quiet sat morning. I have to say highlight of the stay was returning at night and just walking aroungd the central courtyard admiring the architecture of the hotel. You have to see it to understand. Would consider this hotel again for central london stays. Very close to westminster and buckingham palace so ideal for touring the sightsTrentEndRed"
141,678,"Oct 7 2007	Luxury at it's Finest	This hotel is luxury at it's finest. A beautifully renovated old building, and the windows open! Spacious, quiet, pretty room with gorgeous bath. Staff was extremely accommodating, even delivered batteries for my sound machine when I was too jet-lagged to go out for them. The location is superb, walk right over to Buckingham Palace, a nice grocery store very close. I was there as a Priority Reward and was amazed at the wonderful room they gave me. Perfect hotel for a splurge."
142,678,"Sep 30 2007 	Good Location	The Hotel is in a great location and the room was comfortable, but the check-in was extremely slow and check-out even slower.The food was extremely expensive and not very good. Breakfast was a joke, with cold plates and luke warm food. Don't order toast because if it does eventually turn up the rest of the breakfast is stone cold.Staff generally had a very superior attitude and did not have a very welcoming manner.We will not be returning.Married couple from Leicestershire"
143,678,"Sep 30 2007 	Scruffy	After being recommended the Crowne Plaza by a friend and also reading the reviews on tripadvisor, my friend and I were looking forward to a short break in London. Having stayed in Crowne Plaza's before were were expecting the room to be of similar standard. What a disappointment! Whilst the public rooms are pleasing the bedroom can only be described as dingy and shabby. Although the bed was clean, the carpet was stained and the furniture was old (although old can be tasteful - this was tacky) The room looked as if it should have been refurbished about 10 years ago. The bathroom had mildew on one wall and although 2 of us were sharing the room, the housekeeping must have expected us to share a bathrobe as they only left one. It is enough to say that if this bathroom was in my house it would have been pulled out years ago. I wouldn't return to this hotel."
144,678,"Sep 3 2007 	Average hotel no views comfortable bed	My daughter and I stayed here in August in room 0870. This is a standard room.First Impressions of hotel. Very crowded reception, dealing with incoming tour operators. Arrive at 3pm. I requested (a couple of weeks beforehand) a top floor room with a view. The room isn't ready. Told to come back at 4pm and concierge will store luggage. Go off until 430pm. Room still not ready - waited until 445 before obtaining room. Apparently someone had late check out, and then a chair was broken. Why should I be penalised for someone staying late? Reception large airy. Nice seating area for you to wait, and wait and wait.Room 0870 (I do think posters should try to give the room numbers of this place so visitors know the good from the bad rooms). OK, so you have to go through the courtyard to the spa area to access the room, but since the concierge is taking my suitcase I am not that bothered. Lift to accomodation is small/dingy, not a good sign. Corridor is OK, rasberry wallpaper (yuk!), but only 10 rooms on this floor so reasonably quiet. Room small, but two single beds managed to be pushed together. Clean linen/carpet/wall covering. Resurfaced furniture, but looks OK. Only one chair for the two of us, and a long bench in corridor. Bathroom the size of a cupboard, but large enough for a full length bath. Bathroom marble (see piccies). Room is both quiet and peaceful, and the view you can just make out the london eye. Air con works efficiently. Tea/coffee provided as is water on the first night (but not on second!).Restaurant. Sunday night very busy, waitors overwhelmed, little service, but apologies from maitre d'. Food good, not astonishing, but staple (ate from set menu). Set menu changed on Mondays so if you are in a package for a few nights the set menu will get repetitive (only 3 main courses). Desserts very good. Took 2.5 hours for a 3 course meal, which was far too long. On Monday night went in much earlier, and 3 courses in one hour, but waiters all knew we were going to the theatre.Breakfast. Appalling, the worst feature of the hotel. Monday morning 0915am no space in the restaurant, queue, lady asks if i would like to go to alternative restaurant, naively said yes. Taken to a windowless room, through the baggage store and up back stairs. Food not even warm, service lacking, no natural yogurt, no poached eggs. So second morning, as I had an inclusive package, went for room service. This was better, although I did note that they tried to charge me extra for natural yogurt/fresh fruit, but it miracuously disappeard by the time I checked out.I got a good package 2 nights for 242 pounds inclusive of VAT through their priority club points club. since one nights stay without VAT can be from 125 pounds without breakfast, I did well, so I thought I got a good deal, but I would not pay the rates quoted on their website for a room, you can get bigger/modern rooms with a bit of a view at victoria park plaza/the rubens/41 around the corner if you need to be in Victoria. If you want rooms overlooking Buck Palace, Rubens is great (although you do pay supplement, and rooms are quite small).Unless it was a good deal, I would probably not go here again."
145,678,"Aug 26 2007	great location	Just got back from a 3 night stay at this hotel - would definitely recommend this hotel for a trip to London. Its in a quiet location (seemed quiet to me in comparison to some hotels we passed!) but is only two minutes walk from St James Park tube station. Tip if you do stay there - there is an over-flow breakfast room on the first floor - much quieter, and instant service, rather than wait in the queue to get into the breakfast place next to reception. hotel staff that we met were all very helpful and friendly."
146,678,"Aug 20 2007 	Disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza	Location of this hotel is fantastic - can walk to many London attractions. Unfortunately this is really the only good thing I can say about our stay. We went on a Theatre break and the first room we were given was very small with only a single bed in - so back down to reception. The room we actually stayed in was barely any bigger and my first impression was that it was scruffy, dingy and small - I expected better from a 4 star hotel. There was a lightbulb out, a rip in the bedspread, a stain on the chair and you couldn't read in bed as the lighting was inadequate. We also had numerous problems with the keycards to our room and so spent an awful lot of time up and down in the lifts - even after they gave us new cards they didn't work and we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come to our room to let us in - having rung twice.Breakfast was also poor - the dining room was full so we were taken past the kitchens to another room. Some of the food was cold and the buffet was not kept topped up and we were not asked if we wanted anything different although some people obviously were. Overall very poor for a supposed 4 star hotel."
147,678,"Aug 15 2007 	Great Location	I traveled with my mother ,sister, and niece, we had 2 rooms one was smoking and one non smoking. Both rooms were great and we realy enjoyed our stay. Our rooms were clean, comfortable, both with nice views. Being a smoker I liked the fact the windows opened and there was a place to sit in the courtyard to smoke and enjoy my coffee. The food was great and the service excellent . We loved the courtyard, flowers, atmosphere and the fact it was so easy to get a cab to all the sights. I have recommened this great hotel to my friends who will be there in Sept./07."
148,678,Aug 10 2007 	TERRIBLE	The hotel is in a good location but.... My family and I have stayed in three different rooms for three nights and room one was worse than the other. The only reason we did not leave was because there were eight of us (including five children) and most of the hotels in the area were sold out. The rooms were filthy! The carpets and furniture were stained and dirty. In one room my mother asked the management to remove two chairs from her room because they were filthy and she was afraid her grandchildren might sit on them. We hated to return to our rooms at night after a day of touring. This hotel is owned and managed by the Taj group and should not have a license to use the Crowne Plaza name!
149,678,"Jul 31 2007 	LIke the hotel and the location!	22 members of my family stayed at this hotel before and after we did a cruise out of Southampton. I liked this hotel - its obvious this hotel is used as part of a tour group as there is alot of people there - but I was very happy with my rooms. Both were large, clean and beds were very comfortable! Great locations - a block from a pub (love that!) and a block from Buckingham Palace. Would stay there again!"
150,678,"Jul 23 2007 	dirty rooms; musty smell	I would have to agree with most of the other reviews; this hotel is badly in need of renovations, and lack of cleanliness was a real issue. The carpets and bed spread were filthy and looked worn, and the bed felt as if they'd put the box springs on top.There was also the sound of, what seemed to be a train or subway running through nearby every few minutes. Although the Crowne Plaza is very conveniently located, it was a real let down for the price, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
151,678,"Jul 22 2007 	Poor for the Price - Room a bit tatty	Stayed here for one night whilst attending a function nearby. We chose this hotel as it was literally 2 mins to St Stephens Club where we were attending the function.First impression was very good as the lobby is quite nice but I'm afraid the room left a little to be desired. having paiud @140 B&amp;B for myself and having stayed at the Premier Travel Inn near Kings Cross with my family for 100 Travel Inns are much better and more modern.This room was tatty, overlooked the air con court yard with a constant buzz all night.Glad I had a few drinks and slept well!!!!"
152,678,"Jul 17 2007 	Not great for Crown Plaza prices and standard.	Stayed here last week on Business, quite pricey even for London. Rate did not include breakfast or VAT. Room a bit tatty even a smell of paint with a dirty rag in the vent. The Bank Restaurant food was first class though. No views of London at all. Would not stay there again."
153,678,"Jul 8 2007 	Bad Check in Got Better.	We arrived to check in and they struggled to find our second night's booking. Finally they found the second night and we went up to the room. My hotel profile clearly states I do not stop in smoking rooms, yes, I was offerd a smoking room. I went down and asked to be moved and was placed into an apartment - so 10 /10 for customer service.As for the hotel, well the hotel booked me a resaurant, organised my luggage and was very helpful in everything they did.The hotel is in a great location and near to everything, I cannot comment about the food as we did not eat in the hotel.The acomodation was fantastic and would I go back - yes, if I could have the apartment again, but sadly I dont think I would be as lucky, but a nice hotel."
154,678,Jun 26 2007 	It is in the Middle of everything	This hotel was excellent. There was a bit of a wait at check-in but they were very accomidating. This was my first trip to england and the hotel is what a traditional english hotel is supose to be. This hotel is only 2 blocks from st jamese park station so you are very close to everything. Buckinham palace is about 5 blocks away. For the price you pay for this hotel is so worth it you are in the middle of everything
155,678,"Jun 24 2007	Overpriced	As a first timer from the states I expected more. From check-in the problems started. Apparently the staff do not talk to each other as it took hours to get a bag delivered to a room. Even at that it was delivered to the wrong room. Ringing the front desk produced no results. The carpet was in need of replacing as it was raised in places causing a tripping hazard. The air conditioning was all but non-existent. The first day we arrived I had no face towels in my room. It must also be too much for the staff to deliver a newspaper to a room every day as well. The front desk person explained that they only get so many newspapers every day. So for over $300 a day you may or may not get a daily newspaper. That explains everything else.The only thing this hotel can claim is location. Rooms are large by european standards, as well as the baths. Nothing else will thrill the traveller."
156,678,"Jun 2 2007 	All front an no substance	The entrance and foyer were very beautiful. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and know this is usually a bad sign. Al front and no substance. We could not get a smoking room. We were getting married the next day but this was ignored. The room was a standard room, which was small, really for one, and had only one bathrobe and towels for one.The room was also tatty and worn. It also was dirtly. The most shocking thing was the corridors, which were dirty, and the carpet was worn and torn. This is just not what we expected at all.Even though we paid 280 for 2 nights breakfast was not includedI would give this hotel 3 out of 10Very expensive and in need of renovation."
157,678,May 25 2007 	great stay at the Crown Plaza	We stayed at the Crown Plaza St. James in May of 2007.The staff was very friendly and helpful to us.Our room was well appointed and comfortable. On the downside the internet was terrible as the keyboard was not working properly. Coffee was said to be Starbucks in the cafe but must have been really watered down.The location is great for seeing the attractions.A bit pricey but what isn't over there.
158,678,"May 9 2007 	Nice Hotel	Stayed here in late April for 2 nights on rewards points. Great location near Buckingham Palace and was within easy walking distance of the Tube and Victoria Station. The room was much larger than expected and had a nice bathroom/shower. Furnishings were a bit outdated, but overall were in decent condition.Our room overlooked a paved schoolyard which was filled with kids in the afternoon and morning. This was no big deal, just would have rather had a room overlooking the hotel's courtyard as it was very nice. Did not eat or really spend much time at the hotel other than to sleep or change clothes, so we didn't have much interaction with staff or other amenities. Overall, I would stay here again."
159,678,"Apr 18 2007 	Excellent Hotel	We have vacationed in London many times and have stayed at many and varied hotels dotted around various parts of central London and we have come to the conclusion that for price, location and the rooms the Plaza will be our number one choice from now on. If you arrive from Gatwick the hotel is walkable from Victoria Station, there is a Sainsbury's supermarket just around the corner, some good local pubs and as it is in a semi-business district there are a wide selection of shops. Westminster and Trafalgar Square are close by so this hotel is in an excellent location for sightseeing.We stayed in room 524 is a good choice as it has a separate lounge area and an excellent bathroom"
160,678,"Apr 8 2007 	Excellent Room Great Location Nice Service	Stayed at this location on March 20 for 2 nights as we choose London for the start of our honeymoon. The hotel is located some 5 minutes for the underground St. James Park station. Upon arrival you are greeted by the porters that took care of our luggage while we checked in. Because we arrived around 11 am our room was not ready, so we decided to scope the sorroundings. The area is mostly a business center, as we saw a lot of banks. Had lunch at a nearby pub Alberts. Several pubs around offer great food and spirits at decent prices. When we returned to the hotel to our surprise because they knew we were on our honeymoon our room was upgraded to a suite and they even sent us a bottle of champagne.The room was spectacular, had a separate lounge with a tv, nice closet area, big bathroom with lots of amenities. The air/heater worked perfectly.The front desk staff and concierge service where very helpful.At nearby Buckingham palace you can get several hop on/hop off bus tours to further enjoy the city.Hotel has several restaurants but we did not try them, all we had was breakfeast, which was just ok. We expected more but I guess they cook food a little bit different to what we are used to. Overall this was one of the best hotels we have stayed in."
161,678,"Apr 4 2007 	average	This hotel is in a really quiet location for the city centre which is means a decent sleep. The hotel itself was very quiet at night - again for me a major plus. Staff were good on the whole - lots of porters and front desk attention. Hotel standard was average - definitely not luxury- our 'superior room' was faded and a bit tired although quite spacious and clean. Overall the feeling everywhere apart from lobby was tired -torn carpets, marked walls. This may seem petty but adds to an overall feeling of being below a 'deluxe' standard. Breakfast was extremely expensive and not that great (e.g. scrambled eggs made from powder!!) Bistro 51 is okay for a quick dinner - attentive staff etc but a bit lacking in character/ atmosphere and pretty expensive. The local area is purely commercial although the Palace is a lovely 5-10minute walk away. This was a special occasion for us and friends had ordered a bottle of wine/ special message for our room which has yet to arrive. Also only one bathrobe supplied. Lots of little attention to detail missed which did not add to the experience.Not really worth the money any more."
162,678,"Mar 26 2007 	Great stay Great Hotel!	Stayed at the Crown Plaza St. James for a week in March 07. The hotel is in an excellent location, only a few hundred yards from Buckingham palace. We walked to most major tourist attractions in less than 30 minutes. It is a 15 minute walk to Victoria station, or a 5 minute walk to the underground at St James station. The area is not a &quot;happening&quot; area , so may not be appropriate for younger adults, But we (in our late 30's) enjoyed it because it was close to everthing, yet quite at night. We did not eat in the hotel or use any facilities at the hotel . We ate breakfast every morning as we headed out at Bon Gusto, just across the street to the left .Very good, quick food for just a few pounds. We also ate twice at Albert's pub just down the street to the right.the staff at the hotel was very nice, the concierge was helpfull, and the cleaning staff cleaned the room daily and left fresh towels and washclothes every day.We had a standard room with a view of a wall, but again we just slept in the room, we did not spend much time in the hotel during the day. In my opinon, most of the negatives have been very nitpicky, as our stay was very enjoyable.We booked our trip six months in advance through priceline.com, and the hotel was very affordable this way. I have no hesitency ranking this as a four star hotel."
163,678,"Mar 24 2007 	Great location but not a 4* hotel	Spent 7 nights in March '07 at this hotel. Location is great, close to Westminster Abbey, Buckingham palace, St James parc, etc. Initially after checking in got a small king bed room, that we've never spent a night in, moved to a more decent room after complaining. The hotel definetly needs some upgrades/refurbishment for the four stars it claims (I wouldn't give it more than max 3); it's amazing how much they're charging per night. Some drawbacks, air conditioning is set for either heating or cooling, no thermostat option, ended up having to open the window during the night (was too hot ), carpets worn out, chairs squeak [and creak] , elevators that may not work and that you'd have to wait for longer than usual, no free internet. On the bright site the bed was very comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, ie. they've provided us with a 220 to 110V transformer &amp; plug adapter! St. James's tube station is close by and it was safe walking to/from it at night.Breakfast wasn't included, but there are a few affordable places across the street and also a Sainsbury's grocery store is at a short walk down Victoria Street."
164,678,"Mar 22 2007	Great Location Great Service Great Time!	I recently traveled to Rome and spent a night in London at the Crowne Plaza St. James on the way home. Our rooms were large and the bathrooms gigantic by British standards. In addition, they were well appointed and supplied. The staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel offers just about every ammenity you may need. It was a great way to end our trip and relax before the long flight back to the States. I have only one minor criticism - the hotel is enourmous and it can be very difficult to find the way back to the lobby depending on the location of your room. Be sure to shop around for the best rate as this hotel offers some spectacular rates on well-known travel websites. Enjoy your trip!"
165,678,"Mar 21 2007 	Fantastic breakfast!	This hotel is in a fantastic location for all London's sights. Our room was a standard twin but it was a nice size. The beds were comfy and the shower good. There is a lovely outside courtyard at the back of the hotel which you can sit in if it is warm enough. there is access to a fantastic spa and 3 restaurants on the premises. We ate in the french cafe style restaurant. The food was excellent . You had to pay typical London prices but it was worth it. We also had breakfast in our room which the most fantastic experience, like being in a film. They brought in a food warmer trolley which turned into a whole table to sit at. The food was still hot and of an excellent standard and variety. We only stayed for one night but we would definitely go back there again."
166,678,Mar 5 2007 	Had a great stay!	We just returned from a 6 night stay at the St James. We were throughly satisfied with our stay. We booked through a Virgin Vacation package. After reading some of the previous reviews I was a little concerned but after our stay I wondered if some of these bad reviews were at another hotel!! Yes our room was not really spacious but it was lovely and we had the great view of the courtyard. It had an old English feel which I found charming. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our bed was also very comfortable--we later left for 3 days in Paris at the Hilton and the bed there was hard like sleeping on the floor compared with the one at the St. James. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and if we return to London would stay again.California USA
167,678,"Jan 24 2007	Beware of which room you book	Stayed in a well apointed 1 bed suite, but originally after checking in we were sent to a minuscule dark double room on first floor overlooking an airconditioning unit. It was so small you couldn't walk past the wardrobe when if it was open. The room and bathroom were not dirty, but both were old fashioned and fittings seemed poor quality. In a modest two star hotel, it would have been more than satisfactory, but unacceptable for a Crown Plaza. I don't know what category room it was but I recommend not booking the cheapest one. We were then moved to the comfortable suite, which was spacious, newly decorated and had everything we needed. I was struck that the public areas were very elegant, but the corridors in the two floors we saw were in need of refurbishment, even outside the door of our suite."
168,678,"Jan 23 2007	Excellent Hotel with niggling drawbacks	Excellent public rooms and snug bar area, large bedrooms well equipped, everything you would expect from a Hotel of this quality. It has old world charm, and the staff are always helpful. Some minor drawbacks however that leave you feeling that they could do better. A reservation amended for me by their staff had been lost although they did find me a room. A glass of wine ordered from reception at check in never arrived despite my being the only person at reception at the time. A complimentary morning newspaper offered by the Hotel not delivered, and the room was missing any information on their restaurants. Indeed the only information was how to order food in your room, particularly breakfast so I presumed they preferred not to see me. The bedroom carpet was somewhat past it's best and an interior door handle loose. Finally, something that always annoys me, all prices are quoted net of VAT so what seems a little bit steep becomes very much more so with 17.5% added."
169,678,"Jan 18 2007	Excellent Choice	We stayed for 14 nights and we loved this hotel! After booking through priceline, I called the hotel and mentioned that this was our honeymoon and requested a courtyard view. We ended up with probably the most spacious hotel room I have ever had! The air conditioning worked perfectly and was much appreciated. Also, when we came back from our first day out, we had champagne waiting for us - nice touch.My husband and I liked that the area was quieter in the evenings. If you want action and nightlife, this is not the area for you. It was practically deserted after 7pm. But the St. James's tube station is very nearby and we used that every day, no problems walking to/from it in the dark.Breakfast wasn't included in our deal, but there are two small places to eat right across the street and a short walk down Victoria Street is a Sainsbury's grocery store. They have a fresh fruit bar for a good price - we ate healthier here than at home.We would absolutely stay there again - we already miss it."
170,678,"Jan 8 2007 	Wonderful location wonderful service!	My husband and I with two adult children spent a delightful 6 nights at the hotel. The rooms were fine and any problem was immediately corrected (lack of washcloths,etc.). The hotel breakfast was included and was varied and very good. The staff was excellent at the desk, Bistro, and the concierge including the night we came in at 10:45 and were hungry--called and asked the nearby Pizza Express to stay open later. We were very pleased and found the location central to anything we wanted to see. This is not a luxury hotel but a very good one."
171,678,"Jan 7 2007 	not a bad pick	We stayed several times at this hotel, this time over New Year and found it quite pleasant. The room this time was nicely furnished, newer than the last ones, and had a spacious bathroom with window. The reception could be more efficient, since they had erroneously extended our stay by 6 days although we had booked it through a travel's agent last October. This resulted in a long wait until they had found us a new room with the correct dates. Breakfast is rather plain, the choice is limited and the quality pretty mediocre. There are no diet offers and the tea out of a thermos pitiful when one thinks of England as a tea drinking nation. The worst, however, was that they had put a credit guarantee of over 2,000 suisse francs on our credit card and forgot to cancel the amount when checking out, although everything had been pre-paid. This left us with an unusable credit card for the remaining days in London. As I said, better trained staff can be expected from a famous hotel chain. In comparison to other London hotels, however, not a bad pick."
172,678,"Dec 11 2006 	Great stay at the Crown Plaza	Spent the weekend in London and had a great stay at the Crown Plaza in St James.Easy to get to. Very close to Victoria main line and St James underground stations.Great location. Very close to Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament etc. etc.Good room, with nice view over beautiful courtyard.OK, it not cheap, but this is central London!!All in all a very pleasant stay."
173,678,"Nov 27 2006 	Check in for the most expensive Coke youll ever drink!	With its Victorian dcor, this hotel looks great, internally and externally, and the location is ideal for business or sightseeing in the Westminster area. The rooms are comfortable and well-furnished  see photographs. The desk and chair are not however comfortable for any length of time if one is working with a laptop  indeed they are calculated to cause backache. Substitution of a castoring swivel-chair would make a big difference for any businessman wishing to work long hours in the room. The hotel is not however cheap and the staff, though not outright discourteous, are certainly not friendly. For all its aspirations to elegance, a rather nasty impression is given by the fact that this hotel promotes Blue Movies on its TV channels, raising doubts as to the tastes of some of the guests and ruling itself out  in this reviewers book at least - as somewhere that can be recommended to families. The cooked breakfast was excellent  but it would need to be at the price charged - and it would be even better if the staff learned to smile. The most amazing aspect of this hotel are however the Mini-Bar prices. Some examples are:275 ml can of Coke/Diet Coke /Fanta  3.80 ($7.36)500 ml bottle of Still Mineral Water  2.95 ($ 5.72). For interest I worked out the cost of a barrel of the stuff (159 litres), which translates to $1818, which is 30 times more expensive than Crude Oil at todays price!Small container of Peanuts 3.50  thats $ 6.78 Other prices were comparable but I was not tempted by any of these delights, and I also gave the hotels restaurant a wide berth for dinner, reasoning that if prices were excessive in one area, they would be excessive elsewhere also.In short, this is a hotel with certain advantages, but the prices charged are not justified. When a comparison is made with hotels of equivalent standard in major cities in the United States it is hard to see how London can ever survive as a tourist destination."
174,678,Nov 16 2006 	Curates Egg	I really like the St James having stayed there several times. However there are some caveats. Some of the bedrooms have really small beds. The aircon on the second floor seems to be ancient. other floors have more modern controls. A recent stay they charged my credit card twice- hours to unravel without an apology. This time it was two and a half hours before a suitable room was found. lots of staff who won't take responsibility and many with a poor command of English. The food is very expensive. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel go to the Italian cafe across the street. We had tea and toast for two and it cost 2.80.Don't let al this put you off. You can get some cheap rates and overall this is a nice hotel.
175,678,"Nov 14 2006 	Nothing grandiose about it	Don't be fooled by the grandiose lobby, this expensive hotel does not feel good value for money once in your room. I was diverted here from the Crown Plaza London City because of a similar problem experienced by 'elwoodchic'. The check in staff gave off a prententious air about them, and on check out day we were disturbed by Housekeeping at 9am (on a Sunday) and then again at 11.30 for staff to check the minibar. Both of which were uneccessary. The room was very small, with a view of the brick wall and the A/C fans. The bathroom was a 1980s brown, and the TV was from a similar era and obviously needed replacing. It just didn't feel like 155 worth of room."
176,678,"Oct 21 2006	Great location	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza St. James October 3rd for 3 nights.The hotel is located on a side street between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Street. Ideal location for the Gatwick Express train, only a 10 minute walk. This is a very old hotel, but quite cozy. The check in was quick and efficient with speedy luggage delivery. My room was actually located in a separate building across a courtyard. The room was small with slightly dated furnishings, but the bedspread and curtains were of a newer design. The room had a hair dryer and complimentary safety deposit box. The bathroom was quite comfortable with 2 robes, fluffy towels, a scale, makeup mirror and heated towel bar.There is only one elevator in this tower which was quite small, so I opted to use the stairs. I was on the 8th floor, which was the top floor, so I didn't experience any noise. There is a bar and an on site restaurant but I opted not to eat at the hotel because of the prices.The breakfast is 24 pounds which is quite ridiculous but you walk to any cafes and restaurants in the Victoria area.The Buckingham gate area is quite pretty in the daytime, you can enjoy the parks surrounding Buckingham Palace. I walked to Harrods from here, about 40 minutes on foot.The only suggestion that I would make for female travellers is to perhaps upgrade your room from standard. I think that the standard rooms were all located in the separate building so it did seem a bit creepy at night. One night I had a knock on my door about 9:00pm claiming to be maintanence but I refused to let him in. I contacted the front desk and they had not sent anyone up. It made me a bit nervous but the hotel room did have 2 additional safety locks on the room.Anyone can access this tower via the spa doors.Overall I enjoyed my stay here."
177,678,"Oct 20 2006 	Great Value Great Location Great Hotel	We were in London for 8-nights and chose Crown Plaza Saint James. Were so glad that we did. The hotel is beautiful on the outside, has a very nice lobby, and the rooms are large and nicely furnished. The bathrooms are quite deluxe. The location is fantastic. We were three blocks from Buckingham Palace, Victoria Street, Westminster Abby, and the Houses of Parliament. Breakfast was provided with our room rate. The restaurant was nice and the food good. There are two really good Italian restaurants across the street from the hotel. I recommend Crown Plaza Saint James. Hotels are dreadfully expensive in London and bargain hotels tend to be dumps, Crown Plaza Saint James provides value, a very nice location, and a very nice hotel."
178,678,"Oct 16 2006 	Dreadful	We stayed at this hotel because our Insight Tour started from there the following morning.Arrived from a 24 hr flight from Australia to discover that the hotel did not have our booking, despite standing there with a confirmation in hand. Staff were not helpful and it took 2 hours for them to provide us with our room (7pm at night). The door to the room did not close so we could not lock the room.The next morning, as we were due to depart at 6.30am on the bus tour, there was no breakfast yet and we were provided with a box containing some stale bread and a piece of fruit, despite breakfast being included in the tariff.I would not recommend this hotel at all."
