11,1129,Oct 6 2009 	Great Hotel ... Great location	My partner organised for us to stay at the Royal Park for my birthday celebrations. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to find in relation to Paddington Station. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and was touched to receive a 'happy birthday' with complimentary beverages. Our suite was was very neat and the four poster bed was amazingly comfortable. All round the staff were friendly and the establishment is charming. I recommend staying at the Royal Park Hotel.
12,1129,"Oct 6 2009 	What all hotels should be like...	We recently stayed at Royal Park for 2 nights and came away with a very good impression. We were upgraded from a normal double to suite for the same price - when does that ever happen?! The room was lovely and quiet. The bed was AMAZING, as was the shower. The staff were wonderful... very friendly and attentive. Unlike most staff I come across in hotels. And great location... very central and 5 mins walk from the tube stay. There's no reason at all why you shouldn't stay here."
13,1129,"Oct 2 2009 	Excellent value 	My partner and I stayed at Royal Park Hotel for 2 nights in August 2009. The hotel is located in a quiet area close to Paddington Station. The staff was always warm and welcoming and the lobby was clean and well appointed. The room had all the conveniences; free internet access, safe, etc. Breakfast served in the room was a treat. We will definitely stay here again."
14,1129,"Sep 25 2009 	Just wonderful!	Ive travelled a lot and this is the first time I ever make a review on the hotels Ive stayed at. I must say that its not a good idea to stay at this hotel if you are in london for a short time. The reasons are simple; the fantastic staff, the wonderful room and the great service makes you never want to leave the hotel =)Me and my wife have stayed at 5 star- hotels and have visited almost all of the worlds continents but nothing compares to this hotel! The serviceminded staff will make the most to make your stay enjoyable and they KNOW LONDON! That was important to me!Dont know what else to say except that this was an experience we never will forget and I will most definitely stay there next time Im in London."
15,1129,"Sep 15 2009 	Nice Hotel - Good Location	We spend three nights at the Royal Park in September 2009. This was our second visit to London in a year and we were excited to try a new hotel. The Royal Park is conveniently located several minutes from the Paddington tube/train station which made for a very easy arrival on the Heathrow Express. The staff were incredibly helpful and accomodating. The rooms were nicely decorated and furnished. Breakfast was delivered to our room every morning (on time) with a local newspaper. The only negative aspect of our stay was the &quot;squeaky&quot; floors above us which we heard when the guests in the room above us were walking around. My only suggestions would be that the the hotel add a coffee pot/maker to each room and provide a turn down service. Doing so would make it absolutely perfect. Still, the Royal Park was a great place to stay. We would certainly consider staying there again."

17,1129,"Sep 7 2009 	superb hotel	we spent 2 nights in this hotel, it was in our opinion beautiful. it's only a 3 minute walk to paddington tube station which is really handy. i couldn't fault this hotel at all. as soon as we arrived we were greeted bery politely by the gitl at reception. throughout the entire stay the staff were very attentive and so kind. there is no restaurant at this hotel, breakfast is served in your room and you can pick a time for it to be brought to you. its a very substantial breakfast that kept us going for ages. we took a takeaway into the hotel one evening and they didn't seem to mind at all. the room was lovely, it had a flat screen tv and some nice furniture, the bathroom was lovely and the shower was great, as were the bath products. the room was big enough for us two, there was a hairdryer in the room and a minibar and safe. i would definately stay in this hotel again, we loved it and would highly recommend it."
18,1129,"Aug 10 2009 	""the staff are what make this place special""	Having travelled all over europe for 6 weeks and coming to the end of the holiday. It was wonderful to be welcomed by the staff. had a very late checkin due to late plane and the concierge was wonderful found me a number of a chinese restaurant that did take away at 1 am. Organised cultery and crockery for me and set me up in a lovely dining room to eat. I couldn' t thank him enough. I was like they undertand what it's like to travel away from home. The rooms are not huge and breakfast is served in the room in the morning, so it's alittle squishy , but would still recommend this hotel highly."
19,1129,"Aug 10 2009 	Walk to Paddington Station Lovely Room	For our last few days in London we wanted to be close to Paddington Station and the express train to Heathrow. The Royal Park was a pleasant surprise with a spacious, immaculate room, marble bath, flat screen TV, and lovely toiletries. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived and we spent a pleasant half hour on the small patio enjoying a beer,A bit taken aback when room 504 turned out to be down a half flight from the ground level, I was ready to protest that we were not about to stay in a basement but the room was bright and upgraded from the standard. Large comfortable king bed with lots of storage and every amenity made me reconsider my protest.The hotel does not have a restaurant but there are lots of interesting restaurants nearby. It's an easy walk to Hyde Park and only two short blocks from Paddington - an ideal base for shopping, the theatre, and our favourite last night out for dinner."
20,1129,"Aug 1 2009 	Very charming hotel with a wonderful staff.. very proffesional	My family and I have stayed at teh Royal Park Hotel for 3 nights last week, and I normally dont write any review at all but the services I have recieved at this particular hotel, make me write something about David and Katie who deserve it as they have been working very hard to have all our requests ready for us. They do everything from you, from tickets, taxis, restaurants, flight tickets,.... absolutely everything. I would like to thank them so much for all. Will of course come back soon. Thank you very much"
21,1129,Jul 30 2009 	Top class B	This hotel is perfectly located in Paddington and has reduced rates (for London) at about 150 a night. This is because it has neither a restaurant nor a bar. You can get room service breakfast but only breakfast. If you want a super lovely room and bathroom and are prepared to have dinner at one of the nearby resaurants then this is for you. When you arrive you are greeted with a non alcoholic welcome drink in a glass the size of thimble but it is some pulped juice of some description that is nevertheless very refreshing. Rooms are fairly small with traditional decor - heavy swags and tails curtains and rich colours. TV has many channels on offer and rooms have internet cable acces. Wifi available in the one small lounge on the ground floor. My only whine is that when you do have an accessing the internet problem it is not going to get sorted our quickly as they have a consultant who is part time so no rushing to your room to resolve the problem. Nevertheless I stay here whenever I need to in London and would recommend it for sure to those wanting the convenience of Paddington.
22,1129,"Jul 15 2009 	Almost good	I agree this hotel almost gets it right. Problems, however, include air conditioning not working on top floor (also not working a month ago during an earlier stay), and cleanliness not 100%. This hotel chain must be the only hotels in the world where one cannot lock/bolt one's door from the inside (which in my case resulted in the chambermaid walking in on me in the bath!). Also, new rule states one has to stay more than one night - crazy policy which has lost them this regular customer.Reception staff try to be helpful but as none speak English well, problems are more difficult to sort out - not an issue which is exclusive to this hotel, I suspect. Good points well articulated by other posters here. Nice decor, comfortable beds etc.I really wanted to like this hotel, and have stayed here several times, but too many problems force me to look elsewhere - what a shame."
23,1129,"Jul 9 2009 	Hotel almost gets it right but not quite.	The hotel is almost nice. &quot;Free internet&quot; means in the lobby and barely works, &quot;air conditioning&quot; means portable loud leaking unit. Both amenities are two big reasons why I choose the hotel, very disappointed. Complaints were overlooked until I complained three times. Loud, noisy bustling transport hub (Paddington station) so constant traffic and fumes. Extra bed unusable. Arranged for an extra room for three nights due to visitors, was overlooked and had to cram four people into a room for a night. When I got the extra room, it was almost nice except for a weird moldy looking substance around the edges of the carpet. Some of the staff seemed trained and helpful, others did not. There is a very derelict looking apartment complex next door, which makes the whole block seem seedy. Picked the location because of the need to use Paddington three times within the six days, but it is far away from most sights but if you like to walk, it's not too far to Kinghtsbridge (Harrods, etc) across the park.Regular beds were comfortable. Way too much money for the location and the lack of reliable internet and air con (it was 90 out), I don't know why people love this place. It's very ok, nothing better."
24,1129,Jul 8 2009	Wonderful Experience	In my many years of traveling I have never encountered a more pleasant or attentive hotel staff. The room was very clean and quite. The decor was upscale. The beds were very comfortable. The location was great. The prices were very reasonable. Add all of this up and you have a sure bet. I would definitely stay here again.
25,1129,"Jul 5 2009 	How A Hotel Should Be	My wife and I stayed in one of the Park Hotel's entry-level rooms during a weekend break to London. It benefits from a great, central location, within easy walking distance of several tube stations. Being used to staying in large, chain hotels, this was a wonderful glimpse of what I imagine hotels used to be like a century ago. The service was sincerely friendly and about as far from the anonymous indifference I have come to expect from many of the large chains and franchises. Even though we stayed in a basic room, it was spacious, comfortable and decorated with bags of character; the bathroom in particular was gleaming. I had to struggle to think of negative points. With my arm firmly twisted behind my back, I'd mutter about the a/c being a little noisy and the breakfast being prohibitively expensive if you stayed room only, but none of this would stop me from staying here again - which I very much plan to do."
26,1129,"Jul 3 2009 	Definitely a hotel worth considering	We needed a hotel convenient to Hyde Park so that we could walk to the Springsteen concert. We did better, being so close to both Lancaster Gate and Paddington tube stations it is convenient for all of Central London. Yes, the staff are excellent. Attentive, accomodating and courteous. Our room on the fourth floor was at the front of the hotel but traffic and other extraneous noises did not intrude. Apparently the a/c in our room was broken but the hotel provided a large stand alone unit which served the purpose without cluttering the room. As someone else mentioned, the bed was amazingly comfortable. Three wonderful pillows each too. The bathroom had probably the best shower I have ever had in a hotel anywhere and the bath towels were thick and sheet size. Our three teenage boys shared a room on the lower floor, two twins and an extra bed. There was more than enough room for everybody and we heard no complaints for the three night stay. I should add they were also very appreciative that the front desk lent them a laptop so they could update Facebook with the free wireless access in the lounge (its a chargeable cable connection in the rooms). No restaurant but a pricey breakfast served in the rooms may sound nice, but for a family of five this would have been very expensive. Two hundred yards around the corner there is a good selection of cafes serving English Breakfast for about 3, thats a 50 a day saving.Will we be back? Most probably. Its not a cheap hotel by any means but I think we got value for money."
27,1129,"Jul 1 2009 	Excellent From Arrival to Departure	The staff at the Royal Park are as professional and friendly as any I have encountered. There was no request not met, and the hotel was comfortable, well-located, and quiet. There is a lovely garden in the back no one seem,s to know about, and you can have a glass of wine interrupted only by the unobtrusive service folks who are there when you need them. Bravo! Thomas Knight Martha;s Vineyard, USA"
28,1129,"Jun 22 2009 	Terrific Hotel	My wife and I met our daughter, who is studying in England, for a weekend in London recently. We had rooms 606 and 607 at the Royal Park Hotel which formed their own little wing on the main floor, rear side of the hotel. The rooms allowed us privacy from the other rooms, privacy from each other when desired and were clean, quiet and well appointed. Breakfast was served in the room and was a great way to start the day. Upon arrival, we walked the short block or two from Paddington Stn. to the hotel and on Sunday morning I walked the short block or two to Hyde Park to read the Sunday paper on a wonderfully sunny and warm day. The only suggestion comes from my wife and daughter and is to advise you to bring your own conditioner. Otherwise, a terrific hotel to which I would return."
29,1129,"Jun 19 2009 	The most comfortable bed out of one month of hotels!	We only stayed one night because it was convenient for paddington and the heathrow express and it was the best night sleep we had in a month of hotels. Check in was efficient and the lobby area is very nice. We had a standard double which was on the small side but very nicely furnished and comfortable. It was only few mins walk to the station and there is plenty of amenities around the paddingtom area.The only surprise was that there was no restaurant for breakfast, it was all room service.Next time we go to london we may well stay there again."
30,1129,"Jun 16 2009 	Nice but we won't be back	We went to London overnight to see the Jonas Brothers in concert with our 11 year old daughter. Flight was on time, Heathrow express to Paddington and then a 5 minute walk to the Royal Park Hotel. Check in was very efficient and friendly and the room seemed on first glance to be fine. The member of staff who showed us the room took the time to show us where everything was and how the air conditioning worked. She showed us the breakfast card and told us to order our breakfast before retiring that night. We were a little puzzled as to why there was no dining room and that the only option to having breakfast in our room was to have our tray carried out to the tiny courtyard garden. London mornings in June in a shaded area are not that inviting! We only stayed a couple of minutes before going to the concert so didn't take the time to view the room properly. We had a very comfortable looking double bed and a rollaway bed for our daughter. When we returned later that night we noticed that even though the room was well furnished and comfortable, it was very small and, with the addition of the rollaway bed, made getting in and out the bed on that side very difficult. The room was on the ground floor so the blinds have to remain closed for privacy and the view was only of the backs of other houses. The worst part of the room is the fact that the ceilings were not sound proofed and we could hear guests upstairs moving around until after mid-night! A terrible night's sleep was followed by a rude awakening at 5.35am by the guests upstairs (again) getting up and moving around for an hour! Our breakfast came as ordered at 7.45am. The milk for the cereals was missing and had to be ordered and delivered (within a couple of minutes). The croissants were cool and the toast was burned on one side. After the lack of sleep and having stubbed my toe twice on the rollaway bed, I was loathe to complain as I couldn't guarantee a rational mind! After a shower, which had poor pressure, we went to check out. We had booked the hotel with an internet booking agency and had paid in advance, so felt that our complaints would fall on deaf ears. How right we were! The receptionist greeted us cheerfully and asked us how we were. I told her that we didn't have a good night's sleep because of the noise and she said &quot;oh, I'm sorry to hear that, did you have anything from the mini bar&quot;!! Nothing else. Nada. Not a word of apology or an effort to address our complaints. Just, &quot;let me get the door for you&quot;, and we were ushered out. We won't be back. 215 for one night for a small room with a rollaway bed and continental breakfast and all the noise you can hear! Thanks but no thanks."
31,1129,"Jun 15 2009 	Excellent choice near Paddington	We arrived during the tube strike and were lucky to be near the Heathrow Express stop at Paddington. This is a very nice hotel with a friendly, helpful staff. We had tea at midnight as it was 7PM our time and it was fantastic. A great place for an overnight in London before heading out of town!"
32,1129,"Jun 14 2009 	Friendly Elegant Hotel with a Great Location	We spent a week in May 2009 at this hotel. From the moment we arrived and throughout our stay, Jose and Katie and other members of the staff took excellent care of us. They provided suggestions for meals, tips for getting around London and generally met all of our needs. The hotel is extremely well located being an easy walk with luggage from Paddington Station and then for daily excursions to the Lancaster Gate Tube station. The rooms are very clean, a comfortable size and quiet. Breakfasts are extra but are delivered to your room. We will definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to London and will recommend it to others."
33,1129,"Jun 7 2009 	Comfortable and elegant in a wonderful location - we'll be back!	We stayed at the Royal Park as the first stop on a three week trip. I knew the area from a previous visit, and knew I liked the neighborhood, but this was our first stay at the Royal Park. We checked in rather late - about 10:15 PM after a long flight from Canada - and were greeted warmly. 24 hour room service was much appreciated and the food was excellent. The room was a reasonable size and the bed was very comfortable. The bath was also a good size with an excellent shower. The hotel is a very short walk to Hyde Park and central London - but if you need the Tube, both Paddington and Lancaster Gate are within 2 blocks. Very easy access to the Heathrow Express. Breakfast is served in your room and is a delight. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend the Royal Park!"
34,1129,"May 29 2009 	Elegant hotel very close to Paddington Station	We spent our first few nights in London recently at the Royal Park Hotel. What a treat! The hotel is immaculately clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, both on-line (i.e., if you are communicating via email when booking your stay) and in-person (i.e., at check-in, check-out, etc.). In our case, both Kamal and Katie were exceedingly polite and helpful. Our double room appeared to have been recently renovated, and was tastefully decorated, in addition to being spacious, clean and quiet. The luxury bath was exceedingly spacious and also appeared to be newly-renovated with limestone tiles, a double sink and towel warmer. The beds were HEAVENLY and quality of the sheets was superb. We were thrilled to have access to 24 hour room service. All in all, The Royal Park Hotel offered exceptional accomodations and a great value, that really got our first London experience off to the right start. Thank you so much!"
35,1129,"May 5 2009 	Elegant hotel in central location	Stayed in this elegant hotel located not far from Lancaster Gate tube station and Hyde Park. It was within easy reach by foot of Marble Arch/Oxford Street/Paddington Station. Check in was easy and the staff were very polite and helpful (especially Katie), the room was tastefully furnished and very well presented. The bathroom ,although small, was well equipped and the shower (over the bath) was excellent. For a change in a hotel there was a decent hair dryer, which actually blew out hot air . The bed was large and very comfortable. The room backed on to the rear of the building which overlooked a small courtyard, and as a result the room was very quiet at night. The public rooms were elegantly furnished, somehow it didnt feel like we were staying in a hotel, more like a grand house. No breakfast was included in our stay, although we could have ordered continental breakfast at extra cost. Located not far from Queensway, Bayswater and Paddington there were plenty of local places to eat. We really enjoyed our stay here, hard to fault really."
36,1129,Apr 20 2009 	Disappointing Experience	I stayed at the Royal Park Hotel when my usual hotel couldn't fit me in at short notice. Rooms were overpriced. Check-in was polite and friendly. the room was clean but very dark and gloomy overall as it was based in the basement area. Bed was comfortable and bathroom was clean. A simple request for an ironing board and an iron took 3 calls to reception - when the girl from reception did arrive she was rude and short tempered. I asked could someone assist me in regulating the aircon in the room - no help arrived. Room service never arrived on the following morning. Unfortunately on check out only the rude receptionist from the previous evening was available and was disinterested unwilling to discuss my complaints. I am not unreasonable but this visit left a lot to be desired. Overall - never again unless I'm really stuck. Staff should visit the City Inn Hotel in Westminister to see how it's done
37,1129,"Apr 15 2009 	Fantastic staff delicious food gorgeous room and one unbelievablely comfortable bed	I wouldn't normally write a review for a hotel, but the service of this place was truly exceptional and therefore deserves it. I wanted to share my experience with you, so that you can check it out for yourself if you are ever in need of a hotel in London.First up, I am a 26yr old Australian who was in London for a work conference. I decided I wanted to stay in London for a few extra days before I fly back to Oz and so they booked me into this hotel. I checked in pretty late and I guess it was a blessing in disguise as I was upgraded to a bigger and better room :) Rooms in London are always quite small so I wasnt expecting much, but the size of this one was perfect. Great bathroom, (the pressure of the water was wonderful!) spacious living area (the room had two tvs, a couch and a dedicated eating area!), and separate bedroom. Surprisingly when I was there in March, we had some great weather so I spent quite a lot of my time relaxing in the sun on my HUGE balcony. The biggest drawcard to the room, (especially for those enjoy a good lie-in), was THE bed. This four-poster bed was like a work of art and had this amazing, intricate carvings and design. It looked like it cost a fortune, so it made me feel like a princess for the weekend. It seriously was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Last but not least, I just wanted to mention the staff at this hotel, in particular a guy called Jose. (or something like that.. he's the one with the big lips!) He was AMAZING and was the key reason why my stay at this hotel was so memorable. I felt awful because he was doing so much (loved the fact he came up to deliver me my complimentary champagne!) and went out of his way to make my stay at this hotel as comfortable as possible. Hunt him down, because he's super friendly, great to talk to and oh so helpful. In fact tell him I sent you! :p So to conclude, yes, the hotel might be a little pricey for some, but it's so very worth it. Great location, top-notch service, well-equipped rooms - The Royal Park is a winner."
38,1129,"Apr 15 2009 	Very comfortablegood all round with polite welcoming staff.	We stayed in a room with a four poster bed, which was very comfortable. I was able to turn down the heating easily and the bathroom had good facilities, except that I could not find a hair dryer. The service was good, alarm call and breakfast in our room on time. Drinks served downstairs were a little slower but the staff were very helpful.We were given a glass of champagne on arrival which was very welcome having had a horrendous journey by car from Cambridge. I would certainly reccomend the hotel.It is centrally situated and yet quiet, and they are good restuarantswithin walking distance."
39,1129,"Apr 4 2009 	Royal Park Hotel London - Very beautiful stay	We stayed at Royal Park hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is very very close to Lancaster Gate tube station (red line) and Paddigton tube station (blue line). It is a victorian hotel, very classical hotel very beautiful furnitures at all places: Lobby, dining room, rooms etc. All rooms except from the room on the ground floor are very comfortable. Room on the ground floor are not so large but is bog enough to stay and compare to other rooms of other hotels. The hotel is very very clean in general, the room (our room was 609 - 1st floor, large classic room with no view to the main road but with a window to garden view) was very clean, confortable, large bed, small table with 2 arm chairs, very beautiful bathroom, everything was great. The stull also very kind and polite.I propose this hotel to anyone that want to stay to a decent, elegant and bit expensive hotel in London. Not for young people that want to make noise!!! It is a very chic hotel....and if i ever been in London again i would stay there again!!"
40,1129,"Mar 24 2009 	Very nice but some niggles	I spent one night in this hotel as my regular accommodation could not fit me in for an extra night at short notice. The hotel is well located for Paddington station, which made my journey from Heathrow fairly easy. The local area is handy for central London and Hyde Park, and is a quiet area, yet still has good transport links. On arrival the staff were very friendly and made conversation, whilst offering me a complimentary drink, before showing me to my room and highlighting were everything was within the room. The bed was very comfortable, and, as one other reviewer mentioned, there are a selection of pillows to choose from, which is great.The shower was very powerful, which is something I like, and there was no problem with the hot water supply. The food from room service and the breakfast was obviously freshly prepared, nicely presented and tasted great, and a complimentary newspaper was left outside my door in the morning which was a nice touch. The complimentary toiletries were also very nice and the minibar seemed pretty standard, although I didn't use it. There was a hairdryer provided and one thing which really stood out for me was the fact that the bath towels were those nice big bathseets rather than the tiny things you often get in hotels.Overall I had a nice and comfortable stay although there were a few niggles which disappointed me a little, and I'm sure could most of them could easily be sorted out.Firstly, the bathroom sink and the shower were a little slow to drain - not a major thing but probably worth checking. I have not stayed anywhere in recent times where there has been no free in-room wi-fi service available. Wi-fi is free in the lounge at the Royal Park, but for in-room internet access a cable is provided and a charge of 10 is made. This seemed a little odd to me and was also not made clear in any of the information I read in the hotel room or on the website. Personally i think this is a little cheeky, and very expensive - I'm assuming that the charge is per day as I was unable to access the internet when I woke up in the morning. I'm curious as to how this is justified.Secondly, I was surprised by the amount of noise from other rooms. As soon as I arrived I could hear someone talking - I think in the room above mine (sounded a bit like Charlie Brown's schoolteacher!). Very annoying, especially when in the morning the voice I could hear was louder than the tv in my room! There also seemed to be a lot of creaky floorboards in the room above, to the extent that I could tell when someone was walking across their room and I could probably have made a good guess as to where exactly there were standing. It also seemed, as others have pointed out, that there is noise that travels from other people's bathrooms, so you can hear if someone is having a shower or using the sink. I dread to think how embarrassing the noise problem might be if you close to the room of a couple having a lively romantic break(!). There also seemed to be some drilling or something happening in the morning, which was probably some kind of maintenance work. Also, when I opened my curtains in the morning there were some people repairing the roof of an adjacent building so I felt like I should keep my curtains closed. Not a major thing but worth looking out for.I know I have gone on a bit about these problems but really the only major issue is the noise between rooms, which I have never experienced to this degree before. The room I had was perfect in size for me, although if two people had been staying in it it might have been a little cramped. I also note people's comments about the price of the breakfast, which personally I didn't think was excessive for a hotel like this, and there was plenty of everything, although I would say that if you are considering paying an extra 10 for the Full English - bringing the cost up to 25, it might be worth considering that a good breakfast at the Ritz generally costs between 25 - 32 pounds for a continental, buffet or full English (and no, I don't work for them or get commission for that!)Generally a very nice hotel in a convenient location. I may consider staying there again if the noise issues can be resolved."
41,1129,"Mar 23 2009 	Great Service Value and Location. Quiet too!	Just returned from a short stay at this hotel, chosen largely based on Trip Advisor reviews. Overall I was extremely satisfied, and would certainly return there in the future.The location (steps from Paddington) was perfect. I was traveling with an older relative, and I was concerned about her ability to navigate with luggage from the airport to our lodgings. Knowing we'd be arriving tired from the night flight, we wanted a simple transfer. So the Heathrow Express to Paddington and the very short walk to the hotel made it as smooth as possible. The staff greeted us warmly, and gave us an early check in. DO request it, but know that they can't guarantee it, of course. We had a twin room on an upper floor. Not a spectacular view (overlooks residential mews and the back of Craven St. businesses), but sunny enough and charming in its own way. The big plus is that it was very quiet -- the hotel is well renovated with solid windows and doors, so a good night's sleep is assured. The beds were comfortable and generously appointed. Being London, the rooms were small, but big enough for two adults and baggage. Bathrooms are well appointed, as well. Modern, clean, and hot water was plentiful. Loved the traditional towel warmer.The common areas were charming. I enjoyed using the free WiFi in the evenings. You can purchase internet service on a day by day basis, I believe. The staff was ready to assist with electric adaptors for my laptop.We were greeted warmly every time we came and left. We didn't opt for much in the way of room service, since local restaurants and markets were so close by. Again, the location of this hotel was perfect. An easy hop from Heathrow, a very short walk to Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate underground, and even the 15 &quot;heritage&quot; bus. I would also recommend this property to single travelers, the neighborhood surrounding seemed safe and easy to navigate."
42,1129,"Mar 18 2009 	Great place	We just finished a week long stay at the Royal Park. Another couple , friends were also there for a few days the same week. We all felt secure and comfortable. Beds were cozy, Baths nice. Lighting good. Room was small and very tidy.Bath was small but efficient-Shower was great!The staff was impeccable in every way, not only caring for us, but looking ahead. One day, I brought flowers to my wife---we stepped out for a few minutes and on return the Royal Park staff had put them in a vase and nicely arraigned them. I did not think they had even seen me come in with the flowers. The staff could be no better. I would not know how to improve the staff.Location is superior, safe, near easy shopping, cheap food, services,best subway spots. Breakfast was no great value, but always hot and on time, great way to start your day. Excellent coffee shops are a few steps around the corner from the hotel at a third the cost."
43,1129,"Mar 11 2009 	Lovely hotel	I stayed here for 3 nights with my 19 yr old daughter, and we couldn't have had a better stay. The location is perfect. Close to bus and tube, and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens for a good walk when you've had enough concrete for a day.Breakfast served in the room suited us perfectly. Getting ready for the day while you can sip coffee and read the paper was pure luxury for us. Daily newspaper was a big plus. OK, breakfast is expensive,- but good! We added the full english and it kept us going until late afternoon.Rooms are spotless, three pillows and huge warmed up towels. The little extras that make it so much more pleasant.The staff was very helpful, and present in a way that made us feel really welcome. A chat and a laugh means a lot, and adds to a good all-over experience. We also got single beds on request with no fuss.We will be back for our next visit to London!"
44,1129,"Mar 3 2009 	Immaculately professional and deliciously comfortable	From the moment we arrived at The Royal Park we were impressed by the professional courtesy of the staff, who were friendly, smiling, and helpful in a range of matters, answering questions and generally making us feel welcome. Lovely rooms, too!The Royal Park is now our hotel of choice whenever we visit London, and want a warm welcome - on my third visit they even remembered what paper I usually have without even asking!!"
45,1129,"Feb 24 2009 	return visit	After having a very enjoyable 3 nts stay in Dec 2008, we return for a further 2 nts in Feb. Both times we were given an upgrade. The staff are always helpful and polite, the rooms were warm and cosy and the hotel is well based for the underground and places to eat. Breakfast arrived on time to our room and although we didn't have full English there was always enough, they also do a mean pot of hot chocolate. As our son has just passed out from Knightbridge as a mounted blues and royal will be visiting London a few more times and hopfully be able to stay at the Royal Park."
46,1129,"Feb 24 2009 	Mixed bag	We stayed in the royal park hotel over the weekend of the 21st Feb. On the whole, the hotel was excellent. The staff, with the exception of a slow response on our arrival, which may have co-coincided with a shift handover, were absolutely first class and really couldn't be anymore helpful, to the extent one staff member,actually produced a box of over 50 mobile phone chargers to try and find a suitable one. A request for an iron and board was fullfilled with seconds of the request to reception and the porter was one of the cheeriest I have encountered!The hotel itself, is very well presented and comfortable to stay in, it's a nice mix of old english charm and modernism. We had an executive double room, which was very roomy and enjoyable, a good sized bathroom, but the plumbing needs attention though, the shower in our room was stone cold, it was also very noisy when other people's baths/showers were in use. There were some nice freebies and a couple of very comfy robes. The bed was very comfortable and a mini quilted blanket was enough too stay warm over a couple of cold nights, there was also a selection of different graded pillows to suit all comfort levels. We didn't use the air conditioning, but it would be useful come the summer months, when i'd guess it would be pretty stuffy.The breakfast is over priced and if it wasn't for a miss understanding with the booking, we would not have had the in house breakfast. A 2 second walk from the hotel there are plentiful cafes which all serve breakfast, way past 10 am at a much lower cost.There is no bar as such, but they staff are happy to serve drinks in the very comfortable and very english lounge area.It's location is first class, far enough away from the hussle and bussell of oxford street, but close enough too hyde park to let you think you are living in the park, it's about a 2 minute walk to the edge of the park itself. There are plentiful tube stations as well as paddington station itself which are within easy walking distance. How could hotel improve the customer experience?less waiting time on arrival.fix the shower and plumbing.add a kettle and some coffee sachets in each room.Would I use the royal park hotel again?Almost certainly and I hope it's the same staff when I do."
47,1129,"Feb 22 2009 	Great Location Wonderful Staff....	One of the most friendly hotel staff I have ever met. I could not find my way to the hotel from Paddington Station to the hotel and one of the staff went to pick me up, he even carried my luggage til the hotel and offer me a complimentary glass of champagne upon my arrival.. Great costumer service... thank you.."
48,1129,Feb 19 2009 	Superb - quality value and position.	I can't recomend this hotel more highly. Very friendly staff and management who go out of their way to help. The rooms are perfect and have all you need straight to hand. I have also used their meeting room on several occasions and it has been exceptional. Free wifi and a warm fire in the drawing room are great. Its location has been a real help but I think the greatest asset is the staff who are always attentive and well trained. The place is spotless and well decorated.
49,1129,"Feb 19 2009 	A Peaceful Haven in the middle of London	What a loveley way to spend a special weekend in London.We arrived on a Friday afternoon to find ample parking right outside the front door,a warm welcome and a few minutes later we were in our room relaxing with tea and bicuits.Our large room had antique furniture, king size bed and loveley fluffy towels in the bathroom.Once refreshed we went downstairs to be offered a free glass of champagne and canapes before heading out into the west End for a show.The next day after a welcoming breakfast served in our room we walked across Hyde park to Knighsbribge and it was at this point you realise just how well positioned this charming hotel is.What a distant cry it is from corporate hotels, more like staying in a country house.Great staff....Great find"
50,1129,"Feb 15 2009 	Frustrated	We stayed in the hotel from the 11th to 13th February 2009. I had booked the hotel approx 5 weeks before the stay, than, week before the date I had cancelled and than just 3 days before re-booked the hotel room. The staff was very kind in spite of my changes and they had had no problems at all. But that was first and last good impression about the whole hotel staff. Hotel is greatly situated at the corner of Hyde Park, just a few minutes from 2 tube stations. We travelled by bus to Marble Arch station and took taxi to the hotel (just 4.80 pounds). Check-in run without any problems.Our room nr. 602 was situated in street level on other side with a window to yard, which was one floor higher (and equiped with some kind of technology producing noise 24hrs). Room had as the same size as bathroom and it was nice designed. Temperature of the room was cold, although the aircondition was set to 32C, bathroom was totaly freezing - we were assured at the reception, that it was because of the ceiling, it is too high, and there's nothing to do. After 3rd complaining to 3rd different person, our room were supplied with mobile el. heater. Bathroom was equiped with the heating ladder with breathtaking functionality - it heats only after your shower with totally hot water - than the hot water starts circulate through the ladder. It makes sense, when you come to freeze bathroom, wash with hot water, take the cold towel... and within few minutes the ladder gets warm :-(I had no power to complain rickety tiles on the floor - we're still talking about &quot;boutique 4 star hotel called hidden gem in their prospect&quot;.Breakfast is serving to the room, the reason is: hotel has no restaurant at all. You can choose from the breakfast menu - for 15 pounds per person you can choose from 2 types of fresh juice, mug of coffee or tea, msli, joghurt and that's all! It's served with basket of fresh baked pastry (1x croissant and 2x toast slices!) with post mark piece of butter and 3x small jars of marmalade. Other offer like salami, cheese or eggs etc. you must pay extra...One and only positive thing is location of the hotel and recommendation from the staff about Indian restaurant - Noor Jannah 2 just round the corner - absolutely fantastic food and great service.So, do not book this hotel, there must be some better for this price just near to!"
51,1129,"Jan 13 2009 	Charming lovely traditional hotel	I stayed at the Royal Park for 7 nights in December and found the hotel to be very charming and lovely. In fact I can't really fault it!The real positives for me were:Quiet - didn't hear any noise from other rooms or other guests; Clean - room was spotless and a great size and the bathroom was lovely, all furniture in the room was gorgeous with a big chest of drawers and a small table and chairs; Comfortable - great bed, beautiful fluffy white towels and heated towel rail; Location - close to Paddington station but also close to Hyde Park and within walking distance to restaurants, cafesI had breakfast included with my room and it was brought on a tray each morning. This was a lovely touch and made the hotel feel traditional and old fashioned (in a good way), almost like I was staying at someone's very grand house. Free wireless internet in the lounge was great as this was a quiet area with comfy lounges and a fireplace.I accidentally left my passport in the safe and was notified by the hotel before I even realised I'd left it behind...a big thank you to the staff!The only negative I could possibly think of for this hotel was that I would have loved a big fluffy robe in the room...but that's just me!Would recommend the Royal Park to anyone wanting a great central location, a small, intimate hotel experience and a traditional English feel to their stay."
52,1129,"Dec 30 2008 	great hotel convenient location	We arrived on a Saturday for two nights at the end of a 12 day trip to Ireland, Devon and a few nights in Hampshire with friends.the hotel is located a five minute walk from Paddington which is in part why I chose it- -we had a morning flight to heathrow and wanted to use the Express train.The room was standard size or a bit larger and was nicely complimented with accessories/amenities. The shower was fantastic. The bed was very very compfortable and the hotel was serene, peaceful and quiet. We didn't sample the room service but got a nice reccomendation for an Indian place a few minutes walk away. (They also half way recommended the Mitre pub - don't go there- - the worst meal of our trip).Note there are not too many pubs or restaurants right around this area - there are allot of hotels and flats but relatively few restaurants. But given the tube is so close - you can eat wherever you like."
53,1129,"Dec 14 2008	avoid this hotel	Very disappointed by this hotel given other reviews. Noisy (poorly insulated walls), unhelpful staff (maybe they've changed since some of the reviews I read), and overpriced for what is actually a chain hotel not the boutique we'd thought."
54,1129,"Dec 4 2008	Not what you expect before you arrive	Was looking forward to enjoying a great weekend with three other female friends. We travel together once a year for a &quot;girls&quot; weekend. Booked two twin rooms back in July and were rather disappointed to say the least when we were informed only three days before travel that Royal Park could only supply double rooms. Mature ladies do not want to share beds, even with their best friends. A very bad show from a so called top hotel. We don't stand for any of this and have since cancelled to unfortunatey pay more at another hotel at short notice. Not even an apology from the hotel.To advise a change from July to 2 December does not auger well for the standard of hotel. Hope this does not happen to others but beware!! They tend to forget whom the customer is."
55,1129,"Nov 17 2008 	Fantastic Gorgeous Hotel	This is a beautiful hotel, so quaint and yet so glamorous. The service is wonderful and just what you need nothing more nothing less. Very conveniently located, very easy to find would definitely recommend it to everyone at work."
56,1129,"Nov 9 2008 	We Loved the Royal Park London	We stayed at the Royal Park for a week and would absolutely stay there again and recommend it highly. The room was lovely, with a very comfortable and pretty bed and gorgeous bathroom - really superior facilities. The service, both from housekeeping and the front desk was excellent. (Paricularly Ash - who was unfailingly helpful.) This is a hotel that provides breakfast - on a tray to your room. We loved that. We prefer to dine out in a city - so not having a dining room was fine for us - and staff are happy to make recommendations.The location is terrific - close to Paddington Station and Underground - so getting about is very easy. But it was also very quiet - and we slept really well. We also loved being able to walk to and through Hyde Park - and the combination of a busy bustling city and calm beautiful greenspace is great.An outstanding hotel and a lovely holiday for us."
57,1129,"Sep 28 2008 	Good Place To Stay	Had a good experience with Royal Park Hotel for 3 nights during August following a couple of weeks in Europe. Chose &amp; pre-booked this hotel via hotel website after reading previous Trip Advisor reviews. A well appointed boutique hotel in a quite location yet within easy walking distance to most amenities - restaurants, pubs, convenience stores etc - also close to both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. Stayed in 4 poster bed suite - on the small side but very clean. This a not a 5 star hotel so don't expect &quot;bells and whistles&quot; with your stay however you should find the staff very friendly - Rather than eat breakfast in your room - much simpler and cheaper to eat breakfast at Raffles Cafe around the corner (3 quid for a huge Big Ben meal) The only downside was that the room needed some long overdue attention - carpet join frayed (disaster looming) between rooms and water staining on room blinds. Otherwise, hotel was very comfortable and in a great postion to base youself while visiting London. We would stay again."
58,1129,"Sep 18 2008 	Brilliant Staff at the Royal Park	Stayed here with my family in August and must say the Hotel was above my expectations!We had two rooms and both were immaculately clean and well presented, we had a view over looking a private Mews street, VERY London! Everything in the hotel was perfect but I must say the thing that stood out was the staff, you could tell that they really enjoyed working there and were full of smiles and helpful information.The area is a bit quite for nightlife but the city centre is an easy walk away.We loved our stay at the Royal Park and a big thanks from the Robinsons to all the staff again for making our stay so memorable!!!We will be back!"
59,1129,"Aug 30 2008 	Excellent Hotel	Stayed here as our first stop in a tour of Great Britain. The hotel was very nice. The reception could not have been better, super nice people working at the desk there. The room was a bit smallish, but the bed and bathroom were immaculate. The room was extra clean and decorated nicely. We didn't get the breakfast as is was god awful expensive. There is a Neros cafe around the corner, a pastry and coffee for approx 4pound. The view was nothing to write home about, who who sits in their room looking out the window when there is so much to see in London! Paddington station was a 10 minute walk, the Original bus tour (hop-on hop-off) was almost across the street. I would reccommend this hotel, I found the prices a bit high, but the whole city is expensive, so really the price was on par and after all the hotel had high standards. One word of advice, it can be a bit tricky to find, our driver from the airport couldn't find it. It is just off the main street. Also I found the hotel and area in general to be very quiet at night."
60,1129,"Aug 26 2008 	Clean comfortable good location.	Arrived on Bank Holiday Sunday to a pleasant welcome. No offer of welcome drink, tea or champagne. The room was small but comfortable - 6 pillows on bed, an attractive canopy over. Slippers but no robe. Basic amenities. 15 too much for a poor continental breakfast."
61,1129,"Aug 15 2008 	Luxury in London	All the good things written are true. We called from the train station after an early arrival from Scotland on the Caledonian Sleeper, so they had a room made up for us early. Every staff member was helpful and friendly. For our three days in London the room was perfect -- crisp sheets, a tub to soak in, warm towels. Enjoyed complimentary champagne and canapes at 7pm. But, we should have booked on the internet to receive the breakfast package, because over $30 for coffee, rolls &amp; yogurt was too much, so we grabbed coffee from Starbucks at nearby Paddington Station. I borrowed a computer to check the internet, the staff printed our boarding passes. Walked and ran in Hyde Park. Headed back to the States pulling our own bags two blocks to the Paddington Express for the easy connection to Heathrow."
62,1129,"Aug 8 2008 	The best place to go in London for a romantic getaway	I booked the hotel via Expedia for a romantic getaway with my girlfriend and we were both very impressed with the hotel. We arrived too early in the morning but there was no issue in providing us the room keys. The staff was very, very helpfull and the room was small but it had everything I expected... It was nice and quiet and the location (close to Paddington Station) was brilliant!!! The hotel did not have their own restaurant so I order breakfast via room service, which was delivered on time and it was outstanding!I would recommend everyone to use this hotel for a romantic getaway; you will not be dissapointed!Too wrap up: probably one of the best hotels I stayed in to date..."
63,1129,"Aug 4 2008 	Fantastic stay	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Royal Park from July 31st to August 4th, 2008. We booked the room through Otel.com (not a typo) and paid $250/night which included all taxes as well as breakfast for two. The location cannot be beat..it is just a 3 minute walk to Paddington Station and 5 to 7 minutes to Lancaster Gate tube stop. The hotel is very cute, the beds extremely comfortable though the rooms were a tad small (but that is expected in London and we didn't really spend too much time in the room). The bathroom was a big plus, much larger than I expected and clean with just a shower stall (no tub..no worries). I arrived on an early morning flight from Chicago and the lady at the front desk (I think Inge was her name) let me check in at 10.30 a.m..I was eternally grateful! All front desk staff were extremely helpful and kind.Breakfast was quite nice and saved us some $ given how useless the dollar is right now against the pound. It is served as room service and includeds cereal, toast, croissants, orange juice, yoghurt and tea/coffee. We had a garden level room and this was fine as it is truly garden level i.e even the floor is above ground. There was no noise from outside traffice and we slept very comfortably in the room. I'd recommend it highly as it is cheaper than say the Hilton round the corner which is $300 a night before tax and without breakfast. If I return to London, I will stay here again."
64,1129,"Jul 26 2008 	Cute gorgeous nearly perfect	Loved this hotel; definitely the best all-round hotel we stayed at in our recent European trip. We booked a double Exec Suite, but we may have actually been upgraded to a four-poster room without being advised. From my first email contact, they were terrifically responsive. We stayed here for 3 nights in May. The location was fantastic - quiet, but just around the corner from the hustle of Paddington and its facilities with a taxi rank half a block away. The reception welcome was warm and professional, but be aware they don't offer to carry your luggage. Thankfully, there's an elevator. Lovely room(s) with a beautiful view onto the tree-lined street. Our 'Exec Suite' had a small bedroom, small loungeroom and a little bathroom. Bedroom: four poster bed, flat screen tv set into the wall, wardrobe, desk, chair, drawers, minibar and safe. How do you fit all that in to a small bedroom? With minimal walk space, that's for sure. However, it was lovely, from the decor to the crisp linens and comfy bed. I wished I could take the bed with us. It was quite high, and with the four posts and canopy, it had a cocoon-ish sort of feel to it. Everything was great quality, good-as-new and working well. Loungeroom: small room, but they managed to fit in a little couch, side table, dining table and chairs and another wall-set tv, backing onto the tv in the bedroom. I'd say the decor was sort of 'modernised antique' - clean, curving woods and classic damask uphostery. Bathroom: cute, everything you need except counter space. Fluffy towels, heated towel rack. Everything was clean, clean, clean. Room service: we had a disappointment on our first morning when breakfast repeatedly failed to appear. I ended up having to order it three times. They apologised sincerely, so it was easy to let it go as a minor anomaly. Room service on the next two mornings was great. Although a little pricey, the food was delicious and they served yummy biscuits whenever we ordered up tea and coffee. The hotel didn't have a restaurant, but there were plenty of eateries of all kinds close by, and I'm pretty sure you could order afternoon tea in the little communal lounge room. If I were going to London again, I wouldn't even look anywhere else. For the price, this was just a gem. It was pretty, clean, high-quality, well-located and reasonably priced, with friendly and professional service. It scored top marks in so many categories. I can't recommend it highly enough. I would suggest that anyone looking to stay here try for a room with a view onto the street, as the other views seemed a little drab.I've tried posting some of our photos, but my explorer keeps stalling, so I'll try doing that at a later date."
65,1129,"Jul 25 2008 	Loved this hotel	Really lovely hotel in a gorgeous location. The service was great and the room was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom small but really nice. We ordered the room service breakfast which was very expensive but was so convenient (especially when you have a baby) and it was really nice. Really enjoyed our stay, we strolled through hyde park at sunset, just stunning."
66,1129,Jul 17 2008 	Interesting...for couples	Situation is not perfect.Rooms clean.No cotton buds...!Breakfast in the room. (obligatory)Service not perfect.Afternoon Tea and Cocktail is lovely.It is a 4 star hotel.A lot of charm.
67,1129,"Jul 10 2008 	Regal Treatment at the Royal	On the phone we were treated with courtesy at all times. At reception desk the staff greeted us cheerfully, using our names,introducing themselves and welcoming us to The Royal Park. All requests such as use of internet were remembered and catered for swiftly and with a smile. The use of keys, room service, the mini bar, luggage storage, the location of lounge rooms etc were clearly explained. The hotel's location and transport access was fully explained. Any queries about entertainment and other tourist information were dealt with clearly and courteously. Our rooms including the wonderful four poster bed, were clean, beautifully appointed and spacious.The hotel's situation in London adds to it's attraction. A short walk from Paddington Station and Hyde Park- everything at your finger tips.What makes The Royal Park so special is the staff from all areas."
68,1129,"Jul 7 2008 	Rather disappointing nowhere to eat in hotel	I stayed here with a relative for a week. It was very disappointing in several regards for the money, most importantly the lack of anywhere to eat breakfast other than in your room. The hotel has no dining facilities at all. If I was aware of this I would have booked somewhere else and this should be made clearer by the hotel website. I was also not impressed with the staff and their attitude, which was rather cool and disinterested. Also there was no kettle or provision to make yourself a drink (or even biscuits) in the room unless you used a charged-for minibar with outrageous marked-up prices, which is a bit mean and unwelcoming when you first arrive tired from the journey.To be fair there wasn't anything horrifically wrong about this place, its just not particularly great. Ends up being a rather expensive place to rest your head and nothing more, as there's no incentive to stay in this hotel a second longer than you sleep."
69,1129,"Jul 2 2008 	Lovely hotel lovely service	Just thought I would add my comments after our wonderful stay. The room had such character and the staff were helpful, polite and charming.Set in a gorgeous leafy terrace set back from the road, conveniently near Paddington station and a quick stroll to hyde park.I have to mention the exceptionally comfortable 4-poster bed! One of the best I've ever slept in and for such a reasonable price!Highly recommended."
70,1129,"Jun 30 2008	A Hotel of Quality and Refinement	This would have to be one of the loveliest boutique hotels in London.If you're looking for a period hotel that has been beautifully restored with immaculate rooms and exquisite decor, then this is it.My daughter and I stayed in an Executive Twin Suite for 3 nights which was beautifully appointed and impeccably clean. Rooms were decorated with quality furniture and beds were large and very comfy. The hotel is located back from the main road in a picturesque tree-lined street, so there is no traffic noise. There are two lifts servicing the hotel which, in an older style building, is not always the norm.Upon our arrival, we were welcomed by friendly, efficient staff and shown to our room by a delightful gentleman from reception who was both charming and helpful.Paddington Station is just a few minutes walk and there is an abundance of wonderful little cafes and bistros in the surrounding streets. We had two delicious and reasonably priced meals at a great Italian restaurant located just around the corner from the hotel called &quot;Ask&quot;.What you see on the hotel website is what you get. A luxury period hotel decorated to the highest standards. Royal Park is a beautiful hotel and the ambience is one of quality and refinement with exceptional service.Oh, and they make a great pot of English Breakfast Tea!!!"
71,1129,"Jun 25 2008 	What a brilliant find	This was a great find, close to Lancaster gate (central line tube). Easy access to central London. Booked a standard double with breakfast included. Have stayed in London before and been disappointed with rooms but was pleasantly surprised with Royal Park Hotel. Booked it on the basis of previous trip advisors recommendations - have to say agreed. Staff helpful, breakfast filling and bathroom very clean. Beds very comfortable. Would stay there again."
72,1129,"Jun 22 2008 	Hotel made our trip perfecgt	We just returned from 4 days in London after attending a wedding in Scotland. This is my first trip to London and the Royal Park was everything I had hoped it would be. I liked the English feel of the hotel and was treated quite well. We had a room on the 5th floor with a great view. Our room was very clean, with very comfortable beds, loved the soft sheets and huge soft towels. The shower was great. The a/c worked perfect as it was actually quite warm in London during our stay.Included in our stay was breakfast delivered to our room every morning. Being a tea drinker, it was great. but my brother is a coffee drinker and the small pot wasn't enough for him. There was plenty of food though all served elegantly. Our only complaint was that we didn't have coffee/tea facilities in our room so we could have it anytime.I especially have to thank Ali, the manager for all his help. We had decided at the last minute to take the Eurostar day trip to Paris but had trouble booking at last minute. Ali called several of his contacts and got us booked. Ali is the best asset this hotel has. He was very friendly and accommodating and because of him I have nothing but wonderful memories of my stay."
73,1129,"Jun 11 2008 	Lovely. Efficient. Welcoming. Comfortable.	From the moment we walked in the front door we knew we had made the right choice. The staff is very friendly, efficient and have a genuine concern for the comfort of your stay. They make it a point to remember your name. Ask about your day or evening and offer suggestions about the neighborhood and surroundings. Very convenient to Hyde park - 5 minute walk -, Paddington Station and Underground are less than 5 minutes away. Tons of ethnic and &quot;conventional&quot; restaurants within a couple blocks. When I asked if they might know where I could log on and select seats and print boarding passes for my flight home, the desk manager handed me a wi-fi capable laptop over the counter and took me to the very well appointed guest office... way beyond the call of duty. Free. The rooms are very very well appointed, spotless clean, individually air conditioned with guest selectable digital temperature control. Windows that open. Flat screen TVs. Seemed very secure. It was very quiet. Priced appropriately with the dozens of other boutique hotels nearby in the Sussex Garden area. Will absolutely go back."
74,1129,"Jun 8 2008 	Not Great	If you dont mind going to bed when the person in the room above you goes to bed and waking when they wake then it is fine. If not then I would think twice. Our first room an executive double was in the basement and the person above decided to wake at 5.30am on a Saturday morning and proceed to walk around for the next couple of hours - Not great! You could hear every footstep and creak. We asked to be moved thinking it was just that room but our second room on the second floor had the same problem. At least those guests didnt get up until 8 am! I could almost hear what they were talking about too!The airconditioning didn't work in the second room, We didn't receive the welcome drink they advertise in the brochure and the hotels location is a bit too far out for me. The positives were 1. Hyde Park was close by.2. the rooms were very clean and well decorated.Overall very disappointing for the money paid and I cant see why it is rated so highly."
75,1129,"Jun 5 2008 	Mixed reviews	We just returned from London after staying 4 nights at the Royal Park hotel. The property is beautiful and has just been recently renovated.PROS: Nice property, nice rooms, close to the tube. AC works great when it is working. It failed on Sunday and room was a sauna. The property is a 4 star, building wise.CONS: Internet was flakey at best, service maybe 2 star for any problems. Staff is unsure. Costs 12 pnds in cab from Victoria Station. Costs 60 pnds to Heathrow."
76,1129,"Apr 28 2008 	Little gem will be back!!!!!Fantastic experience.....	Just had a weekend in London and booked the Royal Park after reading the reviews. Very nice, clean friendly hotel in a great location. Rooms very tastefuly furnished, comfortable bed and good breakfast. Cant really ask much more from a city centre hotel.We loved the experience, squeezing a lot of shopping during the weekend, and would defenitely use the Royal Park again.Thank you all at the Royal Park for making our stay so relaxing and easy!!!!!"
77,1129,"Apr 22 2008 	Best hotel experience in London	Just back from an extended London weekend. Our group counted five persons - mother&amp;four more or less grown up &quot;children&quot; in three rooms - one double and two twins. Our rooms were spacious (for London), beautifully decorated and clean. Wonderful marble bathrooms with luxurious feel to it. The sitting rooms and reception have open fires and a homely, warm atmosphere. All the staff we met were helpful, friendly and professional, a special thanks to our cheerful Spanish friend who arranged for us to have rooms immediately on arrival at 10 o'clock in the morning!. The location close to Hyde Park, between Lancaster Gate (2 min) and Paddington (5 min), is central, yet quiet. London hotels are expensive and seldom give value for money, but The Royal Park definitely does. The only thing I missed was the typical English coffe&amp;tea making facilities in the room which make long mornings in bed even better.E.S, Norway"
78,1129,"Mar 25 2008 	Great value for London with charm and easy access	This was our fourth time at this property. We seem to go back to this property more than any other in London because of what we get for our dollar. The hotel sits just a few blocks away from Paddington Station so it is very easy to get to and from Heathrow on the 15 minute Heathrow Express. It is just a block from Hyde park.New owners have taken over the hotel last year and I will say the staff is not nearly as attentive as it used to be(with the acception of Jerry) but it does provide great charm and location for your money. Most hotels as nice as this cost well over 500.00 and they are usually very small. Remember, the dollar is cut in half once you arrive. We have stayed in hotels that cost over 600.00 per night in London and found ourselves sleeping in closets with terrible service, so I will praise this hotel on their effort. If you want more space at this hotel upgrade to the Junior Suite. This will give you an extra SMALL room to sit and have a table to drink and eat and not feel cramped in the bed area. There are two small flat screen tv's in this type of room also. The bathroom is very nice, medium size space, with great water pressure for shower and a great tub for soaking. Robes and slippers are provided for your leisure. The mini bar is expensive but has some nice choices when you do not feel like running out. Two large windows give you plenty of light in the bigger rooms, but the smaller rooms seem to be rather dark. The morning paper sits out side of your door when you awaken...nice touch.The four poster bed is very comfortable with fabulous sheets and pillows. My only complaint, and I find this at many locations in Europe, is that two twin beds have been pushed together and they do not use a proper liner so you feel the middle crack...it really is not a king size bed but two twins pushed together...kind of weird but I guess they do not have the space in most places for the typical king. When we arrived they had not taken down our reservation correctly and I did not call to confirm just before arrival, so we were lucky to get our rooms. They had all of our reservations incorrectly booked. It took about 45 minutes but they handled it. Next time I would be hesitant to book over the phone since I clearly repeated myself many times during this booking to make sure they got the dates correct....again, this is a staff issue.We also had the rate go up from what we had been originally quoted and they straightened this out.The best part about this hotel is the location and cleanliness and comfort. They used to have wine/champagne in the evenings which we noticed they no longer offer as a free amenity. With that said, there are so many places to explore in London, it is good to get out! You are close to several tube locations and easy access to walking anywhere. I love London but after this visit, I will continue to search for the perfect hidden gem in London. Many people talk of this hotel being it, but I truly believe there has to be better."
79,1129,"Mar 16 2008 	A great find	We stayed here for a two night break because of the good reviews and we were delighted. Beautifully appointed and clean with very friendly, helpful staff. A small but very comfortable room and with a good bathroom and great shower. Lovely soft bath sheets, the biggest we have seen, wonderful!The hotel does not have a dining room and thus all food is served in your room. We had continental breakfast both mornings and it was very acceptable. Freshly squeezed orange juice, choice of cereal and yoghurt. A basket of toast, croissents and Danish pastries and really hot tea and coffee.The position is excellent. it is in a very pleasant residential area and just round the corner from Lancaster Gate tube station. So for 5.30 per day you can have the freedom of the city and get to all the major attractions. We really enjoyed our stay at The Royal Park, would definately recommend it and will check in again whenever we are in London. Just one grouse. There are no tea or coffee making facilities. So next time we will be taking our kettle!"
80,1129,"Feb 18 2008	excellent little gem in London	We have just spent 2 nights at this little gem of a hotel. The hotle is centrally located, it is well appointed and very clean. The staff are extremely helpful and efficient. The room service is speedy and the staff will even stand outside to hail a taxi for you.We booked with hotels direct and as part of the package they sent us to a nearby cafe, 'Maxims' for a full english breakfast as the hotel can only offer continental breakfast served in your room. Do NOT take this option, it is not part of the hotel and the food is diabolical and the service even worse."
81,1129,"Feb 14 2008	not quite what I was expecting	The description and the reviews I read here convinced me that this was the perfect hotel to bring my mother to as part of a London/Paris trip for her 60th birthday. I wanted somewhere small, special and in a good area. This seems odd but the final deciding factor was the slippers/bathrobe one!!, but unfortunately our small but perfect bathroom didn't have any ( or tea making -which is normally standard in the UK). It's more like a beautiful home than a hotel, which I loved. We were not offered any Champagne in the evening but when I asked for it we got it!!! Getting breakfast in the room was lovely, however I got flu and we decided it was better to return home to Ireland rather than proceed to Paris..I asked about room availability for another night as I felt too rotten to travel but the only suite available was v expensive so we checked out, leaving our luggage in their care. By now we were no longer offical guests -- however when the very helpful man at the front desk heard we were not able to proceed to Paris he offered to phone the company I had booked our eurostar and hotel with to see if we could change for another date, he spent so much time trying to help that it really impressed us.I dragged myself to the internet cafe around the corner and booked a 4star hotel just down the road for only 65 room only -it was fine-no complaints- free internet and use of computer with offer of printing a nice touch- we were in bed by 8 and on the train to Holyhead by 12 next morning. NO PARIS- BUT AT LEAST ROYAL PARK LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION."
82,1129,"Feb 12 2008	Overpriced and noisy room	It is a nice hotel in a nice neighborhood. The Heathrow Express train goes to nearby Paddington Station, which is a great. But room 504 turns out to be in the basement. The floors of this older building squeak, so I heard people walking around in the room above me until well past my bedtime. Overall I feel there is likely better value in some of the numerous other hotels in the neighborhood."
83,1129,"Feb 6 2008 	Hotel Good Ali Great.	Had a nice two day stay here. The hotel is just a couple of blocks from Lancaster Gate tube station, and ditto for Paddington. In addition, the room was clean and well appointed. Another plus, you can open the window slightly which is a pretty big thing for me (prefer a little fresh air coming in). Ali, as has been written before, is very upbeat and helpful. The other staff were also quite friendly and helpful. The only complaint I have is the buzz-in system and dropping your key on the way out. It somehow reminded me of being a kid. For some it is likely to be a non-issue. However, it would not prevent me staying here again."
84,1129,"Feb 5 2008 	Fantastic hotel fantastic location fantastic value	The hotel has a huge amount of character, much better than the anonymous rooms of other hotels. The room was a good size, great bed, great bathroom. Very clean and very high class. I got a deal from the hotels website which made the stay fantastic value for the quality of the hotel. The location is great less than 5 minutes to the tube, 10 minutes walk to the end of oxford street, 5 minutes to Hyde Park. I would certainly go there again and would reccomend to others."
85,1129,"Jan 20 2008 	Plus and minus	I just returned from a week-long stay at the Royal Park. In reflection, it was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I would return. I think the biggest stumbling block was that things were so uneven and that advertised amentities didn't appear. Different things matter to different people, so here goes:This is a great hotel if the following are important to you: air-conditioningdark roomsgood beddingfabulous water pressure and lots of hot watergreat towels with warm towel barmini-barflat screen TVin-room intenet connectionclose to tubes (Central, Cirlce, District lines)feeling safe as a single (especially female) travelerclose to Paddington Stationinternet cafes closeThis is not such a great hotel if the following are important:consistent service from the reception staffeasy entry into the hotel (must be buzzed in)advertised amenitiesan alarm clockin-room coffee/teaquiet roomsinternet available on-sitetaking your room key with you dailyI really wanted to love this hotel. Fortunately, I had read the reviews, so I knew that not eveyone had the same experience. The staff were very pleasant(especially Ali); it just didn't seem as if everyone was working off the same manual. I had pre-paid through the booking site and was checked in to room 306. When I went to check out, they said that I had a room up-grade charge of 125GBP. When I said I didn't ask for a room upgrade, they put the charge aside. Sometimes the front door was propped open,sometimes you had to be buzzed in and sometimes that didn't happen right away. If there was a business meeting, that meant the drawing rooms were off limits. Room keys are very heavy, so it was better to leave it each time you went out. My first two nights I really heard the people in the room above walking around and the people in the room next door. After that the noise faded - don't know if they were quieter people or I was adjusting to the time change. I would really recommed this hotel to single female travelers and those that like easy access to the tube. This is also a great hotel if you get a good deal on rates."
86,1129,"Jan 6 2008 	Hit or Miss!	Stayed here for one night -Jan 2nd 2008 for brief 'after christmas get away'. Had read many of the previous emails and was impressed. Decided to book but from past experience of hotels in London really wondered whether would be a 'hit or miss'. Most definitely a hit! Dropped bags off much earlier in the day eventhough we knew we were far too early for check-in. When returned later in evening was made to feel very welcome by the young lady on the front desk; offered a complimentary drink and then shown to our room where our bags awaited us!Had chosen an executive double which lived up to previous positive reviews in terms of size, decor and roomy bathroom (with window). Needing to find somewhere to eat we found Ali to be a good listener to our needs who advised us accordingly.Breakfast in the room (at a time of our choosing) was a lovely and thoroughly relaxing experience.Finally, all other staff we encountered during our stay were equally helpful and friendly. Somewhere we would definitely stay when next in London."
87,1129,"Jan 3 2008 	Very pleasant stay	My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Royal Park and for the most part, really enjoyed it. We stayed in the two room suite and it was extremely nice to return to after a long day of shopping and sightseeing. The bed was extremely comfortable and cosy.The location is great - close to the city attractions, but in a quiet neighbourhood. Easy walking distance to Kensington Palace.We felt the continental breakfast was a little steep at 14 GBP per person (works out to $56 for two!) and there weren't any cafes that were very close by. There was one around the corner but it was closed for the Christmas holiday season. We weren't offered the welcome drink upon check-in and we weren't ever told that there would be champagne served which would have been a really nice touch. All in all, it was a very nice hotel and we would recommend it highly."
88,1129,"Dec 22 2007 	Enjoyed our stay at The Royal Park Hotel	My husband and I have returned from a short stay at this hotel. Overall I would recommend it. You have to bear in mind most London hotels charge extortionate rates for very average, cramped rooms, often with poor decor.Therefore when I read all the good reviews on this hotel I was dubious, although I wasn't disappointed on arrival. The hotel is not far from Lancaster Gate tube station (on The Central Line).It is a small boutique type hotel, I found the staff to be very friendly. Our room (which was 306) was at the back of the hotel, this did not bother us as it was quiet. The room was small (which we expected) but very clean with good quality furnishings and had a lovely bed with a canopy over it.The room wasn't without fault though, even though the hotel boasts a recent re-furb the carpet was slightly stained and the shower screen in the bathroom had seen better days, also one of the tiles in the bathroom was cracked (these are just minor faults though).The room had all you'd expect from a good 4* hotel, mini bar, bathrobes, slippers, free daily paper. Breakfast was served in our room every morning and although it was continental, felt we got a good choice (we were on a B&amp;B basis, I don't think we would have paid 12.50 per person for it, which is what it costs if you are room only).My only complaints are that the hotel could have done with a bar, and one night after arriving back about midnight (rather drunk) we tried to order from the 24hr room service but were told the Chef had gone home although the man at reception kindly told us directions to a nearby takeaway pizza shop and said it was no problem bringing it back to the room!I travel to London quite frequently with work and have stayed at some of the supposed top 5* hotels in London and believe me The Royal Park would put some of them to shame.Although I prefer to stay in Chelsea/Kensington area as I feel there is more going on in this area I wouldn't hesitate to return to The Royal Park."
89,1129,"Dec 17 2007 	Nice One	I just got back from London yesterday. I have made the reservation on their website price was 176 pounds including vat . Hotel is located in a beautiful neigbourhood, great surroundings, as an English boy's expression located &quot;posh part &quot; of the city. I used train from the airport and Paddington Station just a corner away from the hotel which is a plus. (2 min. walk tops.) Staff was warm, I couldn't checked in as I got there because room wasn't ready but left my luggage hit the city. I realised that it's a little bit out of the center. When I came back ,I accompanied to my room with one of the reception clerks and my bag was in the room. It was on the first floor, with a great bed, nice room design and a great bathroom ( I loved mirror on the wall). Overall it's a little bit pricey in comparison with other countries but I think it's a good price for London."
90,1129,Dec 6 2007 	Everything we thought it would be.	brief and to the point. We read several reviews (here) on several non-cookie cutter hotels and chose this one for our 15th anniversary trip. The hotel was wonderful and the staff very accomodating. Would stay here again!
91,1129,"Dec 1 2007 	Wonderful change from the cookie cutter boxes	We stayed here for a recent London shopping break. We found the hotel to be perfect for a weekend away. We were greeted by professional staff, offered a unique fruit welcome drink and then privately escorted to our room after check-in; nice touch! The lobby was beautiful! Thick marble black and white floor leading to thick plank hardwood floors in the two reception rooms. Enough space to feel like you are in a historic home filled with antiques and real fireplaces..cozy!The rooms were the best part. We had a standard double which was simply elegant to say the least. The furnishing and decor were of high quality like the rest of the posts say on trip advisor. We loved the high-quality linens and blankets and also the high beds! All of the bells and whistles in the room seemed brand new. The bathroom was immaculate. We loved the heated towel racks and all of the stainless steel antique bathroom fixtures. We noticed the hotel had 24 hour room service, but did not try it. Prices seemed reasonable for the food and drinks though.All in all, a great deal to be had at 140.00. This was the same price we played to stay at a holiday inn which just does not compare The boutique style of this hotel and the price make it an attractive option in London. Definitely would recommend and will stay again."
92,1129,"Nov 29 2007 	lovely building but overpriced	We booked an executive room for 3 nights on lastminute.com (which gave us a better rate than the hotel's own site) and it cost about 180 a night for the room.We'd a little difficulty finding the hotel as the website doesn't give directions from the two nearby tube stations. However, we soon recognised the white terrace and checked in. We got our welcome drink and were given our room key. The room was nicely decorated, but still quite small and so there was very little room to manouver as the bed was a good size. We were disappointed to see that there was no bath.The lastminute site had claimed that the hotel provided complementary afternoon tea and evening champagne and canapes to guests, but there was no mention of these at check in or in the hotel information in the room. When we asked (on our second evening) we were informed that the afternoon tea had been discontinued but champagne is served between 7pm and 8pm - unfortunately we didn't get to avail of this.The area itself was lovely and we had breakfast two mornings in the nearby Bonne Amouch pattiserie - I highly recommend their pastries.Overall, while we'd an enjoyable stay, I feel we could have gotten better value for our money."
93,1129,"Nov 28 2007 	Cute and Charming	We decided to stay here based on the overall good reviews and the price. We paid 135.00GBP, whih appears to be a good deal in London these days. The hotel was small, intimate and the staff were great.We really enjoyed the welcome drink and the free champagne and canapes in the evening. The room qualiy was 5 star and the hotel reminded me of hisorical England..something these ultra modern hotels forget these days! All in all a perfect stay at a reasonable price. Area is great as well. Would stay again.Thumbs up!"
94,1129,"Nov 26 2007 	The Perfect London Hotel	The Royal Park Hotel is the only place that I will ever stay when in London! Was there for the Thanksgiving holiday. The room was beautiful, tasteful and elegant. The location was great and near two Tube stations and Paddington Rail Station. The staff are extremely accomodating, and ALI is wonderful! Everything the reviews say about him are true! He will make your stay enjoyable and memorable. I really enjoyed having my evening cocktail while reading by the fireplace. Hey Ali, Brian sends a warm thank you and hello!- Brian Williams, Atlanta, Georgia"
95,1129,"Nov 23 2007 	Disappointing	What a disappointing experience given the wonderful reviews posted on Trip Advisor.I arrived from a very early morning flight and went straight to the hotel. As the hotel was full, I was told to leave my luggage and it would be put into my room once the room was ready. When I returned late evening, my bags were not in my room. When I telephoned the desk to ask where they were, they said they didn't know which bags were mine! I described them, waited for twenty minutes for them to arrive, then decided to go to reception to see what was going on. There they were, waiting to be brought to my room except that it was a shift change and the staff were more concerned about leaving to go home! Additionally, the room itself did not live up to the description and photos on their website. The room was supposed to be 'an executive king size double' except that the bed took up almost all of the space in the room and there was only a walk-in shower (even the standard double room on the website shows a bath). Lastly when I checked out they tried to charge me again despite the fact that I had already paidwhen I booked the hotel on-line.All in all, great location but sub-standard service. If you are going to book this hotel, make sure that you enquire as to which room they intend to put you in as all rooms are not equal."
96,1129,"Nov 22 2007 	Very Stylish	We stayed at The Royal Park hotel for 2 Nights on a Friday and Saturday.We booked an executive room which, although compact, was beautifully formed. I think the rooms seem so small because the beds are so huge. The bed was enourmous, really comfortable. Loads and loads of pillows which was great.The room was decorated nicely in a tradtitional manner. The walls were a nice deep red and with the rain outside we felt extremely cosy.The bathroom was lovely with plenty of hot water, fluffy towels and bath robes.The room was spotlessley clean. Someone even cleaned the hair out of my hair brush which was very nice of them if a tad embarrassing (I have lots of hair).There are a couple of things that would stop me going again unless it was a bit cheaper. We did not have a mini bar as promised. That didnt bother us as we had been told there was a bar. Well, not really.....it is a cabinet in the foyer and the staff were so busy that we didn't want to bother them.The comunal areas looked nice and cosy with fires blazing.We also never received the 'famous' welcome drink or the champagne and canapes. I have to say that these were the nice extra touches that made me book in the first place (and pay a hge 334 for 2 nights) so I was dissapointed. All in all it was a good location, the room was nice and the staff, although busy and flustered were pleasant enough. Not sure it is quite worth the dough though. Next time I want luxury I will pay extra and actually go to a luxury hotel....with a bar.The Royal Park has very good intentions but kind of doesn't quite make it , however, it is a very nice and very posh (if expensive) bed and breakfast. A great place to stay if you can get a great deal."
97,1129,"Nov 10 2007 	Nice European Style Hotel	I picked the Royal Park Hotel based on its location near a company with which I was meeting and on its good reviews in Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed. Overall, I had a pleasant stay of two nights, with only one real complaint.The Royal Park is located in a vertical slice of a row of flats on tree-lined Westbourne Terrace. The immediate neighborhood is composed of similar upscale flats. The Lancaster Gate Underground stop is abouttwo blocks to the south and the Paddington Underground stop and Paddington Station are about three blocks to the north. Hyde Park is, of course, located two blocks to the south, also.The neighborhood does admittedly turn a little downscale a block away toward Paddington as one finds the usual tourist trade businesses associated with European rail stations. Having said that, at no time did I feel unsafe in the area. The location near Paddington Station is convenient, as others have noted, because the Heathrow Express terminates at Paddington Station (take note, Americans -- Paddington Station has a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop if you feel homesick!).The rate that I paid was 146.88 GBP (including VAT) on Sunday night and 188.00 GBP on Monday night, which is quite reasonable in London. An excellent continental breakfast was delivered to my room each morning for 12.50 GBP (I marked my preferences for breakfast on a cardand hung it from the door the night before).The hotel does not have a restaurant, but restaurants of varying quality are located nearby. The hotel staff pleasantly provided satisfactory recommendations for both lunch and dinner.The room was small, as typical for European-style hotels, but it was clean. Both the furniture and the bathroom were modern and in excellent condition. A key reason for choosing the hotel over others nearby is that the rooms had thermostatic control, which worked well. The view from my room looked north across the roofs of a number of apartment and business buildings (i.e., it was nothing special).The bathroom included a tub with a shower and an immovable glass half-partition on the end opposite the tub spigot. I understand from a UK colleague that this arrangement is not unusual in European-style hotels, but it took this American a little time to get used to positioning the showerhead straight down so that he wouldn't soak the bathroom floor.Likely because of old plumbing (years of accumulated scale in the pipes), the shower and sink did drain slowly even though they appearedto be clear of hair and other debris. Hot water was delivered quickly when the faucet was turned on.Toiletry items included shampoo, shower gel, skin lotion, and hand soap. Bath linens included wash cloths, hand towels, and large bath sheets. The bathroom did not have a blow dryer.The room included a small flat-screen TV with about 20 channels. I don't remember any U.S. channels available, though the several Sky channels carry Fox programming, as expected. The TV was located in a small closet next to the main closet. The main closet space was a bit compromised by inclusion of a minibar, but I had sufficient space for my clothes. The room did not have an alarm clock, either separate or built into the TV.Internet access in my room was by Cat 5 cable only (bring your own) and required a call to the front desk to activate. The price was 10 GBP for 24 hours. Free wi-fi is available in the lobby.A complimentary copy of the London Daily Telegraph was delivered to my room each morning.My only real complaint about the hotel is that when I arrived around 10:00 am on Sunday morning after an overnight flight from the U.S., I was told that no room would be available for me until about noon (which was still earlier than the 2:00 pm check-in time). The woman atthe desk offered only to hold my luggage in storage if I wanted to go out and wander around London in the meantime. I took her up on the offer but would have preferred to take a shower and a quick nap first.Two colleagues joined me the next morning and had no trouble getting their room (though one did have a reservation for the night before to ensure room availability). The hotel was very busy on Sunday morning with checkouts by European weekend travellers, so my conclusion is that early arrivals on the weekend should plan for a late check-in or pay for the room to be held the night before.In summary, my stay was pleasant and at quite reasonable rates. I certainly recommend the hotel to others. I would have rated the hotel higher had the staff worked a little harder to accomodate me on my early arrival and the shower been of a design that didn't force me to work to keep the bathroom floor dry."
98,1129,"Nov 5 2007 	A Lovely Place To Stay!	Just came back from staying for 3 nights at the Royal Park Hotel in London and I am very pleased with this hotel! The staff was very friendly and helpful and gave us a really nice room on the 4th floor, facing away from the street so it was very quiet (probably the most quiet room I've ever been in, in central London, so if you like quiet ask for room 402!)The hotel was very clean and pretty and plush. Good central location, very close to both Lancaster Gate tube or Paddington Station and a very short walk from Hyde Park. If you have a laptop with wireless network you can sit in the very cozy lounge (open fire and everything) and access the internet without any charge. To get internet in your room you have to pay 10.The room was immaculate, with a very comfortable bed, wonderful luxurious bedding and plenty of TV channels to watch. I only wish there had been tea/coffee making facilities, but alas there are none.Breakfast is not included in the regular room rate, costs 12.50. We just walked the very short distance to Paddington Station instead and bought all our breakfast stuff at Sainsbury's and asked for cutlery at the reception, worked great. There's a minibar where you can keep stuff refrigerated.I can really recommend the Royal Park Hotel for its excellent location, quiet rooms, wonderful staff and free internet access!"
99,1129,"Oct 30 2007	Very Nice	The hotel was lovely, clean, and the staff were very helpful. I did however, find that the traffic kept me awake. Not the hotels fault but worth noting!"
100,1129,"Oct 23 2007 	great place!	first time travel to London and we booked this hotel based on the positive reviews. the hotel was great!, great location it's walking distance from the Paddington rail station(it connects the express train to Heathrow airport), services were very polite and consistantly smooth throughout our 4 day stay. room is a little bit small but very clear. the only thing is that they dont have a microwave oven in the room otherwise it'll be perfect! but definitly we'll be stay here again next time we visit London."
101,1129,Oct 23 2007 	Loved this little boutique hotel!	I did extensive research on this site for hotels in London and had originally booked at a Best Western in Kensington. I'm so glad that I cancelled that reservation and booked a room at the Royal Park. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's right by both the Paddington and Lancaster Gate Tube Stations which makes it so easy to get everywhere in London. The staff at the front desk were so helpful. They gave us great suggestions where to dine and one of the staff even allowed us to borrow his personal laptop to access the internet. The room was very tiny but beautiful and comfy. I think the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom was all marble and immaculate. The shower had great water pressure. We especially loved breakfast in bed and the yummy hot chocolate and warm croissants. I hope to stay here again the next time we go to London.
102,1129,Oct 20 2007 	Not bad not bad..	Clinically clean hotel in quiet spot 15 minutes walk from Marble Arch. Well appointed bedrooms (not overlarge) and pleasant bathrooms. Continental breakfast ensuite was a bit if a squeeze but no complaints about the food - apart from a sparsity of tea and coffee. And no hospitality tray! Our stay was for one night for my wife's birthday treat to see the Sound of Music and I earned brownie points from the hotel selection. The staff were helpful and polite. There is convenient parking at the front in a private road - there may be a charge.
103,1129,"Oct 16 2007 	Excellent	The Royal Park Hotel is excellent. All the past reviews are exactly correct. I won't repeat them here. What we found was a hotel with a discrete entrance on a quite tree-lined street 1.5 blocks from Hyde Park.. Upon enetering you will find a very nicely appointed check-in area and day lobby with comfortable seating. The hotel is finished in high quality materials and workmanship. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed with excellent bedding. The baths are autoclave clean and bright as an operating room. High quaity fit and finishes everwhere. Very clean public areas. The front deak was staffed with young, energetic, well informed and helpful staff. Paddington Station 2 block away and two other Tube stations . Nice restaurants also 2 blocks walk. This hotel is great value and I recommend it. I found it on Trip Advisor."
104,1129,"Oct 15 2007 	Charming hotel!	We stayed here for 4 nights in October and enjoyed it very much. The rooms were beautiful, although we did not have much of a view... The staff were excellent and helpful as well. What really impressed us was the location. With both Hyde Park and Paddington Station withins minutes of the hotel, we had no trouble getting around."
105,1129,"Oct 13 2007 	Very Nice	We originally booked The Parkcity in London based on TA reviews but then as I did more research The Royal Park made more sense because of it's proximity to the Paddington station. The hotel is a short block from the underground which made getting around London easier. However, Paddington is several stops from all the main attractions so you do ride the tube a bit longer. The hotel is close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens which make for a lovely walk in good weather.The hotel is a pretty, classy affair that is well priced and in a good, safe location. However , I do have a few complaints. First, the rooms ( we booked an Executive double which was more expensive than the Standard ) and all I can say is think &quot; cruise ship &quot;. It was extremely small and although we had been warned that London hotel rooms are small, I didn't think an &quot; Executive double &quot; would be this tiny !We couldn't pass each other in the room and had to crawl across the bed to get to the other side. Two people could not be in the bathroom at the same time unless of course one was in the shower. Curiously, the shower had a half glass door which is completely ineffective in keeping the water in the tub. Instead it sprays all over the small bathroom and makes a mess.The bed was the best part with comfortable, amazing sheets and three choices of pillows. There was NO ROOM for luggage and we had to cram our two medium size bags under the desk. Very little hanging room in the closet for clothes. I can't imagine what people would do if they had more luggage than we did.We also heard the upstairs guests all night with slamming doors and creaking floors. They would be better off with electronic locks as the huge key makes alot of noise as you try to open the door.Secondly, upon check in we were to receive a &quot; welcome drink &quot; which was never offered. Nor was the afternoon tea or champagne in the evening. I only found out about these niceties when we came in from a long day of sightseeing and the receptionist said &quot; sorry you just missed the champagne and canapes &quot;. Seeing how tired and disheveled we looked it would have been nice if she would have just offered us the refreshment as it was only a few minutes after the alloted time. Breakfast is extra and very pricey ( what isn't in London ? ) We just went around the corner to a small grocery store and bought fruit and juice or further up the street is Cafe Nero which has great coffee and pastry ! Since there isn't a coffee maker in the room , I think they should offer complimentary coffee and tea all day in the lobby. Of course, they want to make more money by charging for all the extras and it's expensive ! There is no restaurant on the property just the pricey room service. You may use the hotel laptop for email at no charge plus the phone in the conference room can be used for direct dial at no charge. While very clean and pretty, I think I'd like to try somewhere else for my next stay. It may be that the Royal Park is the best quality for the money...I just don't know enough about other London hotels in this price range to be able to fairly judge."
106,1129,"Oct 11 2007 	As good as all the reviews suggest	I really can't add anything to the many positive reviews which were the basis for our decision to stay here. Everything was excellent, service, location, price, rooms, staff. We made more use of room service than we have in other hotels and each time it was great. Highly recommend this hotel."
107,1129,"Oct 10 2007 	Terrific	We had an overnight layover in London on the way back to the States. With an eye towards doing some last minute siteseeing, we chose the Royal Park due to the proximity of Paddington and the Heathrow Express. From the moment we walked in and saw the fire going in the cozy living room to the very helpful woman behind the desk, this place surpassed our expectations. It definitely deserves the high TA ranking it has. We walked in to our room and just felt &quot;class&quot; for lack of a better word. It was good sized by London standards with a lot of closet space and a bed pretty much more comfortable than the one at home. Sheets, blankets, pillows, furnishings, lighting....everything top notch. There was a flat screen TV with more stations on it than anywhere else we stayed in Eurpoe. The bathroom, while not huge, featured really fine old English style fixtures. The neighborhood is not the most happening which was a little bit of a problem trying to find a place to eat after getting in so late (the fish and chips place around the block turned out to be really good...I believe it was on Spring St.). However, for stays not so rushed, again the Tube and train station are right around the corner. One little side note, getting off the Express, the London map was packed away and we left the station on the Eastbourne Terrace exit thinking we knew where we were heading and ended up going a very long block around and out of the way to get to Westbourne. Make sure to use the Praed Street exit!We were just looking for a place to crash and did not get to spend enough time there, but feel like we stumbled on to a great hotel and will definitely stay there again next time in London."
108,1129,"Oct 9 2007	A true gem	We did a lot of research on London Hotels before booking this one. Some of the reviews for other places were awful, but the Royal Park was great. We originally booked through a discount site I'd never heard of (bad idea). It ended up not working out well, but a quick call to the hotel directly and they booked the room for the same price the discount site advertised.We arrived and were greeted by a small (by American standards), yet clean and elegant hotel. The room that night was very small, but a king size bed (which in Europe means two twins pushed together) and a large, extremely clean, inviting bathroom. The bed slept well and we had a skylight (of sorts) that showed treetops with some cathedrals in the background. Breakfast was a bread basket with jams, yogurt, cereals and more. Very tasty.At the last minute, we needed a place to stay in London about 5 days later. We showed up on the Royal Park Hotel's doorstep unannounced and had to stay in the 4-poster suite (aww, darn). It was more expensive, but well worth it. Again, the room was clean, elegant with a real king size, 4 poster, soft bed. The room also had a small sitting area, more closets than I have at home and a large bathroom.The stay also included complimentary champagne and snacks, which was a nice touch. All in all, I was VERY impressed with the hotel. It was clean, friendly, and had a great location (one block from Paddington Station). Also of note, the room service was not overly expensive and very good."
109,1129,"Sep 25 2007 	Great hotel - highly reccommend	We stayed in this hotel on two occaisions - once at the beginning of our vacation and then again at the end before we flew home. We chose this hotel largely based on the reviews, location, price, and the fact that they have adjoining rooms (more on this below). The location is a couple of blocks from Paddington Station and so has easy access via. the tube to all London attractions. There is a great Italian restaurant just around the corner on Praed Street (inbetween the hotel and the train station). The hotel itself is on a quiet residential street and is very well maintained. The staff were helpful throughtout the booking process, the stay, and then after we left. The rooms were really nice and spacious - hard to believe the spacious part given that it's in London city central but it's true. My one critisizm is that we requested adjoining rooms, were told that this could be accomodated, and then when we arrived were told that the adjoining rooms were not available. Having said that, we made this request of another hotel we stayed in while in the UK, were told no problem, and then were similarly dissappointed - there seems to be a pattern here. The Royal Park Hotel did however upgrade our rooms and make sure they were next to eachother so it worked out fine. Overall, I would highly reccomend this hotel."
110,1129,Sep 25 2007	Ali was the best	Close to Picadilly station we arrived to what we would call a hotel of character in San Francisco. The interior is very nice and well maintained. Ali was the manager on duty and helped us to get a perfect room. He had the best suggestions for dining and sightseeing. We would definatly stay there again.
111,1129,"Sep 19 2007 	Can't wait to go back to the Royal Park	My husband and I stayed with our 2 year old daughter earlier this month. We needed a hotel close to Paddington for a 7:30 AM flight out of LHR. What a lovely hotel. The room was SPOTLESS - especially the bathroom (which has not been my experience in other hotels in London). The bed was so comfortable! The staff was so helpful and kind. They even lent me their laptop so that I could schedule bus rides during the tube strike. I would stay there again, even if I didn't need to be close to the station."
112,1129,"Sep 12 2007 	What More Could You Want	The rooms were beautifully decorated with obvious thought given to use of the best materials. The public rooms were a delighful combination of antiques and reproductions while having complete access to the internet and modern business conveniences. The property was extremely clean and the staff accommodating. Privacy and quiet were paramount. While located in an upscale residential Bayswater neighborhood, public transportation was easily available. Of particular note was the assistant manager, Ali, for whom nothing was too much trouble. If there was a question, he had the answer...the correct answer. I suppose his greatest asset was that he took the time to take the time to listen, evaluate and propose sensible solutions. All this was done with great charm, courtesy and aplomb. Ali possessed qualities of a different era in a very twenty first century way. Client service was key."
113,1129,"Sep 11 2007 	Cannot wait to go again!	After booking an Hotel earlier, for a birthday treat else where in London for 3 nights, excitedly I decided to look for reviews, how glad I am that I found this site, the one I had booked was dreadful!!! I was so upset. After a lot of hassle I managed to change my booking. This was the best thing I have done in a long time. We got to the Royal Park a little early, this was not a problem, we were able to leave out luggage &amp; go for lunch &amp; a walk round. When we came back, although the room was not quite ready, we were given coffee while we waited, we were also told we were being up-graded, fantastic, it turned out that we were up-graded to a four poster bedroom. (I could have done with some steps to get up on it, short legs Ian says!) The staff could not have been nicer, or more helpful. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone, well worth a little extra money, for peace of mind, &amp; comfort. FANTASTICHappy traveling!"
114,1129,Sep 8 2007 	Beautiful and charming	I have booked a last minute stay at Royal Park and was not dissapointed. I live in London but the stay has felt like a trip to countyside. It is in a quiet residential area but close to the town (cab 5 to Park Lane). The staff were nice and bedroom so beautiful. Shame I have fallen asleep and forgotten to order breakfast!
115,1129,Aug 25 2007 	Charming Hotel!	Very charming small hotel in a residential-like area of London. The room was very beautiful and the beds were absolutely heavenly!! We arrived early in the day and our room was not ready. We mentioned how tired we were from travelling and they were very accomodating in getting our room ready so we didn't have to wait until the normal check-in time. We would definately stay there again!
116,1129,"Aug 7 2007 	An excellent find	Finding a hotel in London which makes you want to return is not trivial. This one provides great value for a very reasonable price (again, quite scarce in London). Room was lovely, clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly, and you can drag your trolley straight from the Heathrow express."
117,1129,"Aug 1 2007 	The reviews are true!	I chose this hotel on the basis of the reviews on tripadvisor and the hotel deserves the high praise it has got it. The location is excellent, just beside Paddington Station. The staff were very helpful and enthusiastic. The room was small-ish but the space was well used. We had an extra bed in the room for our son for an extra 15 pn which was great value. The bed was fab as was the bathroom with a large bath and strong, hot shower. The extra were great too...newspaper, slippers and robes, mini bar. Overall , really enjoyed the stay and would definitely recommend it/stay here again."
118,1129,"Jul 23 2007	As good as everyone says!	This hotel really is splendid. To start with, it is about two blocks from Paddington. It's one of the sandstone buildings on the green leafy streets nearby that I've always wondered about. I booked here because the Starwood, Hilton, and Marriott properties in town were all around 500 GBP that time of year. This was far, far, less, and I really couldn't tell the difference. The staff was incredibly solicitous. Breakfast was quite tasty. The room was beautifully decorated -- traditional, but not heavy or oppressive. The building is gorgeous, too.Bathroom was good-sized (but has that weird European thing where the shower panel covers only half the bathtub.) Had to request an iron, but that's typical in Europe too.I will probably continue staying at Le Meridien Picadilly and the Sheraton Park Tower when the prices are reasonable there, but when they're not I'll certainly be back at the Royal Park."
119,1129,"Jul 22 2007	Being Pampered	We can strongly recommend this hotel.We were very pampered and given every consideration.We contacted the hotel on various occasions either by e-mail or phone, and were always given extremely courteous help and guidance.The views from the windows were not beautiful, but then this is London - we expected to see rooftops and anyway, we were never in our rooms except to sleep and clean up. We went onto Cotswolds and Scotland for the beautiful views.My Mother had occasion to use room service on several occasions, and was very well pleased.The Concierge was a little weak - but not necessarily of their making. They were always trying to give us advice and assistance to the best of the information provided to them. We were adquately compensated for any inconveniences and problems that did arise - such as the London Pass - everything was not as they and we expected."
120,1129,"Jul 18 2007 	Brilliant	What can I say, I don't normally write reviews but believe me this hotel deserves one :)From check in to departure is like home from home without the work.I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on 4 occassions for business and I would highly recommend it to anyone.Friendly, clean and though small the rooms are very spacious for a boutique london hotel.The staff as a whole are very friendly and helpful but Ali the concierge is a star, I am sure I am not that memorable, but he greetsyou like a family member when you return - full marks :)Tina"
121,1129,"Jun 19 2007	Wonderful luxurious stay!	I traveled to London with my mother in May and couldn't be happier with my choice of hotel. We were greeted with a snack of dried apple dipped in sugar and a little glass of fresh mango juice. Also, we arrived much earlier than the official check-in and were shown to our room immediately. The room was great--a large window overlooking rooftops of neighboring buildings (and it opened a bit for fresh air). I know that European rooms are typically smaller than their American counterparts, but I thought our room (a twin deluxe, I believe) was spacious enough for us. The bed linens were out of this world comfortable. Really--we wanted to BUY these sheets, they were so comfy! The room was super clean and the bathroom was fancy, clean and handsomely appointed. The location is perfect--a quick walk to both Paddington station and Paddington tube. There are restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance too. We didn't have any hotel food, so I can't comment on that.The staff was friendly and helpful. We felt well taken care of. If you have the money to spend--spend it on this hotel. I would definitely stay here again."
122,1129,"May 27 2007 	Lovely one night stay.	Lovely Hotel with lots of charactor set in a nice location and surprisingly very quiet. Staff very friendly and helpful. The bedroom was small but lovely, attention to detail very good, the bed had nice crisp pillows and bed linen, we had a superb sleep. bathroom very clean and bright. My Wife and I had a basement double room, there was a mini bar, hair dryer, a small flat screen lcd or plasma tv. over all a very nice stay, however I do not recommend the food! My wife and I had the lamb cassarole, it seemed like it had been frozen and heated in a microwave, I may be wrong but thats how we feel, also the bowl of vegetables were not good at all, stringy is the best way to describe them, our friends did not eat them and asked them to be taken off the bill, our male frined had dijon Chicken and to say it was a small helping is an understatement. If you intend to eat its worth walking around the corner and eating at one of the local cafe's.I do recommend the Hotel, a very nice short stay indeed"
123,1129,"May 25 2007 	My Second Stay still a good choice	This was my second stay at the hotel within a 6 month period, both times alone and for business. The room is small, but very comfortable and modern with a nice bathroom. (That half a piece of glass thing instead of a shower curtain seems standard in London, it still baffles me, but its your country, I guess that is why you get the second towel, so you can mop up all the water that goes on the floor). Overall a very nice place to stay. Access to the tube, the Heathrow express and Hyde Park are excellent. For all my fellow runners a great location, I went for a very peaceful run in nearby Hyde Park each morning, . I learned from reading others reviews to avoid the basement rooms and requested an upper floor on both stays and have been very happy. The price of the room service continental breakfast seemed a bit steep ($24, ouch!), but there are lots of restaurants that offer full breakfasts for much less (under $10) and they are just around the corner, plus there is a Starbucks at Paddinigton, also a block away.I have stuck out twice now on getting into my room early (before 11 AM) when arrving from the overnight flight from the US and have had to kill a couple of hours before the room was ready. The manager did get me a room as soon as he could (11 AM). I really felt he was truely making his best effort, it was just that the hotel had been full the night before on both occasions. Glad I didn't know about the bed bug thing noted by the reviewer who was there just days before me. Yikes! No such problems for me. Great place for a couple of days but it would be cramped for a week., or if you are a person who spends a lot of time in your room.I do recommend this hotel highly , but only for short visits."
124,1129,"May 24 2007	Bedbugs	Apart from the bedbug problem, I thought the hotel was charming and comfortable (and very clean) but not sufficient for business purposes. I emailed the hotel when I arrived home (after seing the dermatologist) to notify them of the problem and its been 5 days and I haven't heard back from them."
125,1129,May 2 2007 	Charming	I stayed at this hotel on a theatre break package in the West End. First impressions were good as I have just moved to the UK and was impressed by the beautiful white 1800s Victorian townhouse faade. We did book with theatre tickets and was impressed by the location and access into the West End which is walk able to Oxford Street. The room was new and did have a plasma TV and great dcor package. What was nice about the hotel was the traditional feel along with a newness that seemed to exist indicating a recent refurbishment. The hotel felt cozy and the lobby and public area dcor was grand! The breakfast was great in the room and really cannot fault the hotel. Great value at $130.00 pounds a night over a busy weekend. Liked the location and access to underground plus the area was rather nice and residential.
126,1129,"May 1 2007	loved it	we found the royal park to be ideally located in a charming, quiet residential neighborhood, yet only 3 blocks from two different tube lines and thus very convenient as a jump off point to other parts of london.we had an executive room for six nights, and though not large, it afforded ample room to move about, and was beautifully and comfortably decorated. the staff was consistantly friendly and helpful. daniel deserves special mention.note that the royal park is a small hotel. if you're looking for a pool, spa, or restaurant on premises this may not be the hotel for you. my wife and i found it to be perfect."
127,1129,"Apr 30 2007 	Hidden Gem in Leafy London Sinead Smith Dublin Ireland	Myself and my mother stayed here for a girly weekend in London, the weekend gone. On our arrival we were greeted by Ali, the conceirge and were given a lovely welcome drink. All the staff were very friendly and professional at the same time. Our room on the 4th floor was a twin executive room and it was superb. The bathroom was lovely, we had twin handwash basins, which was brilliant and the beds were very comfortable. The little extra touches were lovely too, with a turndown service at night. The location was brilliant too, only around the cornor from Paddington Station, which is so handy if you are travelling on the Heathrow Express (as we were) and also a short walk to Lancaster Gate tube station, which services the Central Line and brings you right into Oxford Circus. Would totally recommend this hotel for a long weekend or any lengthly stay in London."
128,1129,"Apr 27 2007 	Grand Finale	Stayed here on our last night after my husbands birthday treat to Britain. What a find!Beautiful traditional English hotel in the most wonderful situation you could imagine. Breakfast in bed and what a breakfast - beautiful china and the finest of tea.Daniel and all his staff are beyond words. I would have liked to take him home for my daughter!!! Helpful, curteous and simply quite charming. All in all you couldn't ask for a more wonderful end to a delightful trip. Didn't want to leave - ever!Very close to Harrods - much to my husband's horror, the beautiful and quite stunning Hyde park and Padington Station - what more could a tourist ask for.We will most certainly be back."
129,1129,"Apr 26 2007 	Very English and Adorable!	What can I say? After staying at numerous townhouse\boutique hotels in London, this one by far stands out. The check-in was smooth and quick yet personable and friendly. The complimentary afternoon tea and scones were a nice treat and very pleasant indeed. The complimentary evening drinks were also welcomed. The room was newly renovated with a bright modern yet still a very traditional english decor. Location was great just a walk from either Paddington or Lancaster Gate stations or a quick walk to the west end or Hyde Park. Only issue I can think would be the lack of signage and the hotel being located on a leafy residential street kinda tucked away. Enjoy it!"
130,1129,"Apr 6 2007	london gem	my wife and i stayed in london at the end of march for 3 nights. we were on a rather indirect route from sydney to dubai. i did my research on your web site which is great but still came up with a long short list. i was encouraged by good reviews from other visitors and finally a good rate for a 4 poster bedroom with separate sitting room of 230GBP + VAT. there is nothing, after a long flight, quite like walking into a hotel lobby and then your room and experiencing that moment of enjoyment when you realize that your image of the hotel is matched by the reality. the hotel is lovely in every way. part of a white row of 5 storey mews buildings ( so typically london ) the building has been refurbished in the last 2-3 years ( ? ) it is maintained impeccably. the room was beautifully decorated and the king bed extremely comfortable. although there is no breakfast room we ordered breakfast each day and it arrived in not more than 5 minutes. on a tray of course but we had a sitting area to eat in. the breakfast was lovely and beautifully served. the service at the hotel is excellent. daniel and every other member of staff were professional friendly and added to the ambience of the hotel. the location is excellent being about 400 metres from lancaster gate tube and the northern entrance to hyde park. a morning walk across hyde park and you're in harrods ( for better or for worse ). and paddington station is just a few blocks away.all in all we highly recommend the hotel.rob mccourt"
131,1129,"Mar 21 2007 	Perfect	Hong KongDate:13 March, 07Reviewer: A tripadvisor member.I stayed in this small luxury hotel last year in Nov.06, I wrote a review on this hotel with not quite a perfect impression. I chose this hotel this time because talking about conveniency, it is second to none, and the iniside ambience, say the room, bathroom and the common drawing room is exactly the style I love it. The only little foible I concerned in my last review was the &quot;Sound insulation&quot; cas' we were given the basement that there were pounding footsteps in the late night and early morning.This time, my husband and I emphasized on an upper floor. (we told him our story last time). The one who received us was very cheerful and helpful, he saw to our question and offered us the 3rd floor. My husband and I had a very pleasant stay this time and our experience with this hotel can be concluded these ways.Staff: Very experienced, cheerful and always ready to help.Room: Perfect!! You will love to come back after a day's journey.Conveniency: Second to none. There are many restaurants  nearby and Paddington is just five mins walk away.Extra point added to the free Wi Fi in the drawing room area (Not in the room). Really beneficial to computer user.Will definitely choose this hotel next time I visit London!!"
132,1129,"Mar 20 2007 	Convenient comfortable...	The Royal Park is probably the most comfortable and placid hotel you'll find, en route from Heathrow into London after a long flight. It's only three blocks from Paddington Station, the terminus for the Heathrow Express. And it's a tiny oasis of traditional English comfort and calm, near the Lancaster Gate tube stop and only a block from Hyde Park. Traditional, in the case of this hotel, does not mean old -- bathrooms are sleek and modern, and many rooms are very quiet. The only downside is that there are no food or beverage services on site. There is breakfast on a tray to your room in the morning, but that's brought in from the outside, and any tea or coffee at other times also has to arrive from elsewhere, with at least a 10 minute delay. Caffeine addicts may not find this adequate..."
133,1129,"Jan 25 2007 	A very pleasant stay	I stayed at the Royal Park Hotel for one night whilst on business. Great location, about 3/4 mins walk to Lancaster Gate and same the other way to Paddington station.On arrival, you are welcomed by courteous and efficient staff reception staff.Getting into the room proved a little difficult with the traditional key (not swipe) but once you got the knack it was ok! You also had to buzz at the main door to get in each time which was a little frustrating.The room was small (even by London standards) but was exceptionally clean and of a high standard with a very comfortable bed. Excellent shower/bathroom a definite plus!The Royal Park is a stylish, warm and welcoming hotel and I would stay again in the future."
134,1129,"Jan 20 2007 	Comfortable and convenient	The location of the hotel is really quite convenient, as Paddington Station is only block away, affording easy access to both the London Tube and Heathrow Express. Our room on the second floor was very quiet (probably benefiting from the middle-of-the-week, off-season stay) and was clean and very nicely furnished (bed, linens, toiletries, etc.). The staff was friendly and helpful."
135,1129,"Dec 28 2006	Fantastic Spot	Had a wonderful stay at the Royal Park. The rooms are traditional, beautiful although not huge. The hotel is within walking distance to Paddington Station. Two huge thumbs up."
136,1129,"Dec 22 2006 	Great room but where is the service?	- Arrived in late evening. We approached the front door of the hotel carrying our luggage. I thought the bellman would rush to the door to help us, but i had to ring the bell so they would open the door. Not the warmest welcome after a long traffic mess on the M5...- Approached the desk and no welcome greeting yet...- No welcome drink, scone, tea, etc. or any mention thereof that evening or the next day.- The bellman then appeared and was quite cheerful. Half the staff were friendly and the other half were indifferent. - Room appointments were excellent. Linens, bathroom, lighting, etc.- Room temperature control was poor though. Heater on maximum and still not reach a warm level.- Housekeeping excellent.- Internet price expensive, but reliable.- Continental breakfast in the room was fresh.- Very close to the Tube. - Several choices for places to eat around the hotel.In summary, the room was fine, but the service was not up to par. We stayed at the Kennard Hotel in Bath and the owners did their best to make us feel welcome. I was hoping for the same level of service here, but the welcome mat was rolled up..."
137,1129,"Dec 6 2006 	Best Hotel Experience EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I absolutely LOVED this hotel. I cannot rave about it enough. I am very picky and have stayed in a lot of hotels and this one is by far my favorite. My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived, Ali the concierge made us feel so welcome and treated us like royalty. We arrived at 10:00 a.m., tired and jet lagged from our trip and our room was ready....we didn't have to wait for the normal check-in time. The room was beautiful, very clean, spacious, great London view, etc. Ali, and the rest of the staff, answered all of our questions about travel on the Tube, tourist attractions, places to eat, a trip to Stonehenge (which Ali booked for us), etc. The really made us feel at home. The location is great....two Underground stations, each just a short walk from the hotel. The neighborhood was beautiful. We found a restaurant called Raffles right around the corner where we got breakfast every morning. Good food, good prices and great service. My husband and I loved this hotel so much, we are definitely going back next year. I highly recommend it to anyone."
138,1129,"Nov 27 2006 	Good stay at the Royal Park	We booked this on [----] for 150 sterling/night for four nights for a standard double- price included VAT and breakfast. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. They did try and stick us in one of the basement rooms right off the bat, which was annoying, given that we were going to be there four nights - why try and put us in the worst room? Basement rooms are not good at all - at least the one we looked at was small, and had that dank, basement smell. We were then moved to a standard double on the 4th floor. On the small side, but very clean, and the bathroom was good sized. Hotel itself is quite pretty, though the staff is not super friendly. Breakfast in the room is a nice touch, as are the complimentary scones and tea in the afternoon. Location is quite convenient - we arrived late in the evening, and took the Heathrow Express to Paddington, and did the same for our early departure. We found some decent restaurants relatively close by, and access to the tube was obviously excellent. Overall a fairly nice place - though its been said many times, you certainly don't get much for your $$ in London!"
139,1129,"Nov 6 2006 	Good very good but.....	First the many positives. Beautifally clean and fresh. Nice quiet room with comfortable bed, smart bathroom and the mother of all power showers.Breakfast in bed was delightful, as was the afternoon tea. Young, friendly, and efficient staff. Top location, only 5 minute walk to Paddington, so easy access to all major tourist spots.On site parking is a rareity in central london.30 per day but a big plus if you are driving .All in all then,a lovely quirky hotel,and we enjoyed the stay. However, at 160 per day,we expected a more professional response when we rang the hotel on our return home, after noticing that we had been charged for 2 cups of tea on arrival having been assured by the concierge that they were complimentary. The hotel promised to look into it and ring back. Six days later we are still waiting.I e mailed the hotel over the weekend,suggesting that they might at least give the 6 quid to the cleaners who do an excellent job.Might seem petty,and we will still be able to pay the mortgage this month, but in my view it's shoddy customer service"
140,1129,"Oct 15 2006	A Wonderful Hotel	All of the personnel were friendly, efficient and professional. The front desk personnel were terrific. These individuals were able to answer our every request, made superb restaraunt recommendations and ensured that our stay was perfect. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to a return trip in the near future.Daily breakfast, tea and champagne in the evening. Some of the best service we've ever had in London."
141,1129,"Oct 3 2006 	A cure for jetlag!	I have been to London a LOT for business and have never quite found a decent hotel, even among standard business chains. I've never had a need to stay close to Paddington station before, but I am sure glad I did this time. I would definitely stay here again - I feel so strongly about it, that I'd be willing to stay there and transfer between a couple of lines on the Tube to get to a meeting. I was so comfortable at this hotel that I slept soundly for 10 hours the first night there--no sleeping aids required! As a result, I never experienced jetlag on the trip.The hotel has obviously been through a quality remodel, and it's extremely clean and super quiet. I wasn't sure if there were any other guests until I hung out in the lobby for a bit. The lobby, by the way, offers free wi-fi access. This hotel is in a cozy, tree-lined neighborhood across from a park. It's literally around the corner from Paddington, so you don't need a taxi."
142,1129,"Oct 2 2006 	Relaxing weekend at Royal Park	After flight delays and a chaotic day we arrived at the Royal Park later and more tired than we hoped.The location is easy to find and within comfortable walking distance of Paddington.Our room was comfortable with a modern bathroom - a bit on the smaller side but we expect that in large cities. Probably one of the best mattresses we've slept on - and we are very persnickity.One negative - the windows are fixed not to open too far so if you are a fresh air fan...esp. a problem after a very hot, steamy shower.We really liked the breakfast service to the room - comfortable, romantic and alone.The personnel is mixed - some are fantastic and very, very nice. some are obviously very young and just learning.We only realized some of the &quot;perks&quot; on our last day - we were not offered a welcoming drink, nore saw anything about afternoon teas and/or evening canapees - maybe next time.We really liked the Royal Park because of it's size - not the huge touristy hotels with huge cafeteria like loud breakfast rooms.If you are looking for a relaxing quiet London location with personal service, this is it."
143,1129,"Sep 27 2006 	Happy to stay again	My sister and I (in our 50's) stayed here 15, 16 Sep Room 407.Great room, not large but hey this is London. Quiet aspect but no view, suited us just fine. Got a good night's sleep in their excellent twin beds (twin executive room). Great linen and towels.Bathroom excellent with good amenities, no external ventilation withstanding. Air con worked well.Staff are young, European, full of enthusiasm and friendly. Breakfast in room was of good quality. Room service limited but good and timely.Noted the comment re restaurants, tourist traps and concierge service.. We utilised the hotel concierge for a minicab to Heathrow and have to say, paid a premium. Mind you we had a great driver and a Benz, so the the 50 quid did not hurt tooo much!For the price cannot fault hotel. Paid 140 pounds with breakfast."
144,1129,Sep 20 2006	Good Service and Very Clean	The Royal Park Hotel is located near the parks which are exquisite. The Hotel is attractive and most of the front desk personnel are helpful. The rooms while tasteful are tiny with poor ventilation and light(no fan or window in the bathroom) Street noise can also be heard. The elevators were broken often. They also refer you to restaurants which are tourist traps and overpriced..I wonder if they are paid a commission on these restaurants. No breakfast is included and there is no restaurant on site. Room service is prompt and the quality is good. The youthful staff is very accomodating and the hotel is immaculately clean. The public rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated.
145,1129,"Sep 19 2006 	Lovely hotel in a residential setting	My husband and I were looking for a hotel in the Paddington area of London, and I came across the Royal Park in doing Internet research. After reading TripAdvisor reviews (and asking a friend in London to &quot;inspect&quot; the hotel), I booked a room for two nights in September.It truly is a lovely hotel, located in what originally was a residence (or two residences) and difficult to distinguish from its neighbors which remain in residential use. The rooms are very well-appointed and, while not large, entirely comfortable for one or two people. The bed was outstanding: lovely to look at and very comfy, with high-quality linens. The bathroom also was very nice. It had excellent water pressure and attractive fixtures. In addition to providing adequate hanging space, the closet held two bathrobes, two pairs of slippers, plenty of wooden hangers, a safe, and two extra drawers (in addition to those available in two antique chests in the room). We also enjoyed the high-tech, flatscreen TV.My husband and I have stayed in hotels in many cities, and I honestly don't think we've ever encountered staff people who were as friendly as those at the Royal Park. One of the concierges, Daniel, literally greeted us at the door whenever he was on duty. We made limited use of staff services, but those we experienced were excellent.The hotel isn't inexpensive, but it certainly is well-priced by London standards. We would highly recommend it."
146,1129,"Jul 31 2006 	Absolutely wonderful place to stay	Stayed recently at this charming little boutique hotel and was delighted. Complementary champagne on arrival, free upgrade, friendly and pleasant staff, luxurious quiet room and air-conditioned which made all the difference! What more could you ask for? Its a 4/5 minute walk from Paddington, so thats 20 mins from Heathrow which for us was the reason for our stay before an early morning flight. It's not badly located for those wishing to explore London either, with good bus, train and tube links and several restaurants staying open reasonably late nearby to choose from, although room service looked more than tempting. Breakfast is served in your room. I don't wish to stay anywhere else in London now. I was very comfortable here and although the rate was 140, actually in the grand scheme of things it was very well priced compared to the alternatives on offer. In this instance, you really do get what you paid for which is unusual in London!"
147,1129,"Jul 12 2006	Ali - The concierge	The Royal Park Hotel in London is adorable. The rooms were quaint, warm, and inviting. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially Ali, the concierge. Not only did he go out of his way for us by booking theater tickets and giving us the inside tips for secret restaurants and hot spots, but he made us feel completely at home and was genuinely concerned about our enjoyment of the city. I highly recommend this hotel and hope your experience is as wonderful as ours was."
148,1129,"Jun 30 2006	Another Fan	I just spent two nights at the Royal Park. It was absolutely delightful. The location is three short blocks from the Paddington subway station. I was comfortable walking alone at night because of the activity and good lighting along the way. The rooms were small but very tastefully decorated. I especially enjoyed the thick, oversized towels and the silky smooth sheets. The complimentary room service breakfast with fresh fruit and fresh squeezed orange juice was convenient and delicious. But, most notably, the service was top notch. When I pointed out the subtle smoke smell in the first room I was assigned, I received an immediate apology and was given another room. I had numerous questions regarding events, activities and transportation directions. The staff was always helpful, and even cheerful when offering advice. When I inquired about internet service, I was provided a laptop to use during my stay. The one problem I experienced was that the wireless service was unreliable. However, the staff made every effort to repair the service and didn't charge me the wireless fee when they couldn't correct it. I will definitely recommend the Royal Park to my friends and will stay there during my next trip to London."
149,1129,"Jun 10 2006	This hotel is the best	We just returned from our Honeymoon in London and we stayed at the Royal Park Hotel for 6 nights. I'm a real stickler for clean hotel rooms and this room was immaculate. They cleaned it thoroughly everyday so when we returned from sightseeing the room looked like it did when we checked in. I could not have asked for more in that department.The little touches were really nice too. They had heated towel racks and the toiletries were incredible! They were not your run-of-the-mill soap and shampoo. The towels were huge and soft, the bed was oh so comfortable. My husband really appreciated the electronic safe. The room service menu was delicious and champagne hour is a real nice touch. I can not say enough about the staff. They were the most professional, friendly and helpful staff we have ever encountered from a hotel. Everyday we asked questions about the city and they were always delighted to pull out a map and point us in the right direction. When we mentioned we wanted to visit Stonehenge, they arranged for us to join a tour. When we asked where to eat they gave the best recommendations. They arranged transportation for us from the airport to the hotel. They made our trip easy and very enjoyable. They really are the best. I was a little nervous about the location but it was perfect. Everything is so close to this hotel. There are 2 tube stations within a 3 minute walk (Paddington &amp; Lancaster) and the bus stops are everywhere. I highly recommend this hotel and know that when we go back to London we will always stay here."
150,1129,"May 31 2006	Little Gem	I'd never heard of the Royal Park before our recent stay. However, it is a little gem of a place. We booked two rooms - for ourselves and a family member. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite but the normal double room was just as nice with a table and chairs as well as funky new TVs and luxury bathrooms. We had a rate that included breakfast - I wouldn't want to pay extra for continental but everything was very fresh and well-presented and lovely to have it delivered to your room so you can have breakfast in bed. What particularly made this hotel stand out was the way they looked after us. We were travelling with a 20 month old baby and I expected such a smart hotel to be a bit snooty about this. However, they couldn't have been more helpful. They provided a cot and linen for us and because we were having breakfast in our room, we could share it with our son without any problems (also saved having him rampaging around a quiet hotel dining room!). We had brought a family member with us to listen in to our baby monitor while we went out and the hotel put us in rooms opposite each other which made life easier. Although they have no restaurant, they have an excellent room service menu and our 'babysitter' enjoyed their dinner at a proper table in their room. They have parking directly outside the hotel and although they charge 30 for 24 hours, I would recommend this over trying to find a meter in the street and you have the added security of knowing your car is being looked at overnight. I would highly recommend this hotel for the comfort of the rooms and for the level of service, rare to be so friendly in such a smart hotel. I do not think this hotel is overly expensive - they do have some deals at weekends and compared to other central London hotels, many of which are pretty soulless, this is good value."
151,1129,"May 31 2006 	Trip Advisor to the rescue again - Very Good Small Hotel	That's it. From now on I only stay at hotels with good Trip Advisor recommendations.After 10 days in Paris we found that our hotel there had not been booked for the final night so we decided to head to London prior to catching our flight home. We quickly scanned the Trip Advisor site and located this hotel, choosing it because it was near Paddington and thus we could easily catch the train to the Airport.What a wonderful and relaxing experience. We were treated impeccably well from the moment we arrived. I had indentified the wrong night (must have scrolled down by mistake) when booking yet this did not present the slightest problem upon check in. We were shown to a very pleasant room with all amenities as promised. The Hotel did not seem put out (as many are) that we were travelling with a small baby but rather were very welcoming.Although we were a few minutes past tea time, tea (complementary) was arranged. We went for a walk and the desk clerk was happy to suggest a route and show us on a map. We returned and ordered dinner along with our again complementary champagne. While the menue was not extensive - the food was fresh and well prepared. We tried to add a well deserved tip to the bill to be added to the room charge- not having pounds with us. This was cleary unexpected and considered unnecessary. The concierge offered to arrange transportation to the airport and it was handled so efficiently we decided to abandon our plan to take the fast train and to take advantage of the arrangements offered through the hotel. Our only disappointment was that we were not staying longer.We travel regularly on business and I would think are fairly discerning travellers. This hotel is a wonderful find and we will certainly stay there again. We've now utliized the Trip Advisor site several times and have always found the information &amp; recommendations to be an excellent resourse in a sea of unverified information."
152,1129,"May 15 2006 	Small but Surprisingly Good	Thank you very much for Hotel-London and the Tripadvisor.com for recommending me such a fine hotel. I travel a lot and stay a lot in mostly 5 stars hotel, I think This Royal Park Hotel Paddington London is one of the finest I have ever stay, very special thanks to Ms. Ishita Arora, the Assistant Front Office Manager; she was so helpful during my whole stay, she even helped me to retrace my Visa card safely from a restaurant which I left behind after the dinner. Actually, all the staffs are doing very well, I can give most of them an A+ without any hesitation.The room is small but with all the utilties very handy, the beddings are all of top grade, the house keeping is doing a very fine job. I have special interest about the power shower, its just wonderful after a long day. I have no doubt in recommending this nice property to anyone visiting London."
153,1129,"May 4 2006	location 	perfect location, very clean, we had a beautiful week of rest. the management is very kind"
154,1129,"Apr 26 2006	Great location for top attractions at the Royal Park London	Stayed recently for a short spring break. Great location and quality rooms all spotlessly clean. Lovely comfortable bed, no road noise (but could hear what must have been a family of rhinos wearing clogs upstairs). Generally a good night's sleep each night. Staff very helpful with nice touches such as complimentary paper, drinks and use of hotel brollies! Would recommend to friends and family.Bad points:Breakfast is very overpriced. Cereal, toast and coffee for 2 people was 20. I would recommend Patisserie Valerie about a 20 min walk."
155,1129,"Apr 21 2006 	Nice feel but getting pricer	I have been a regular guest at the Royal Park since last year when I saw it reviewed on Trip Advisor. The rooms are very spacious as are the bathrooms and the staff are generally quite friendly. The hotel has a nice boutique feel about it.High points:Nice toiletries, great beds and linens, excellent quality room breakfast, great central location. The afternoon scones and tea are a delight as is the evening drink if you are able to take advantage. A fairly good room service menu for the size of the hotel.Low points:Views from room are lacking and the airconditioning in a number of the rooms is sporadic or non-existent. This can make it very chilly in winter but extra blankets are available on request. The baths or showers sometimes have problems draining, but the toiletries make up for that! My biggest gripe is that the room rate has increased significantly in the past couple of months and you can no longer get the cheap rate including VAT frm their website. In fact the cheapest rate for this hotel now puts it in the league of some international four star places in London. When considering the lack of other facilities found in such hotels, this becomes a little overpriced. I wouldn't normally be too fussed about this, but when I pointed out that I was surprised by the unusual spike in the price rate at reception on checkout, the receptionist was particularly snooty and said that I was getting a great rate anyway. Not true, it was previously 130 for an executive room including brekkie and VAT. Now the 130 doesn't include VAT or breakfast.So all in all, I have started looking around again for other places, but I do recommend the place as a good quality boutique hotel."
156,1129,"Mar 30 2006 	Highly recommended	Just checked out of the Royal Park after three nights. I have travelled to London about 20 times in the past 3 years, this was my first stay here. I usually stay at one of the Hilton hotels near Paddington but they were full. The Royal Park is a lovely hotel in all respects. Small but luxurious rooms, nice bathrooms, quiet, perfect service and very close to Paddington station. It makes sense that it's ranked so highly in tripadvisor. If you plan on staying there, enjoy it!"
157,1129,"Mar 19 2006	I'd go back without a doubt	My first trip to London, we stayed at this hotel - and I thought it was a great location for getting on the Circle line. The rooms were great, that bathroom was NOT the size of a closet, and we were able to get internet access in room without issue. The location is peaceful, and the beds were comfy. The bathroom was also very clean and nothing was old or in need of repair. When I go back to London, I won't hesitate to stay here again - the staff was great. We got a great deal through Expedia."
158,1129,"Mar 5 2006	Just great!	We had a great time at this hotel - there are not many times that you are struck by the very high quality of a hotel, this is one of those times!From the glorious &amp; elegant black entance door that slowly opens to reveal the immaculate drawing room and reception to the quiet corridors leading to your private and beautiful room, this is very good indeed.The lovely touches of a welcome sherry and tea with scone and glass of champagne before you go out are brilliant - all in the price!This hotel has parking out side but is 30 per night, the hotel does not have a restaurant or fitness, but I like that - it is simple in concept and elegant by design.Worth checking out the hotels website for late deals as well - you might get a nice surprise!The whole feel of the hotel is that it is very well looked after - perfect and high quality fixtures and fittings in the rooms and great bathrooms and breakfast in your room - very romantic indeed."
159,1129,"Feb 7 2006	Best of the best in London	My mom and I stayed her for a long weekend to be with friends who live in the city. This is by far one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. The staff is amazing, they are so friendly and very helpful. Nice location (as many other reviewers have noted), and for being in the city, our room was pleasantly quiet. Yes, you do hear people walking above you sometimes, but it's not enough to bother you. The afternoon tea and b-fast are 5 stars, it is a beautiful hotel.As other reviewers have noted, it is a difficult place to find. Before you go, please take a look at their website and print out their background page that includes a mini map of their location. I had to show taxi drivers it so they could locate the hotel. The reviewers have given great photos, especially of the front door of the hotel, as well as the church photo. Those are the best visual landmark to find the hotel when taking a cab or finding the hotel after walking around."
160,1129,"Feb 6 2006	A wonderful hotel	7 of my family stayed at the Royal Park Hotel to celebrate my Mother's 70th Birthday. I had booked based on reviews from this website. We all really loved this hotel. Its immaculately clean and the interiors are really beautifully done. Its also really well located, a 2 minute walk from Paddington, but then also only a few minutes walk to Hyde Park and onto Knightsbridge and Harvey Nichols!However, what really made it stand out were the staff and their attention to detail, they really did make it so special for my Mother. I did read some comments on noise from other rooms - and yes I could hear noise from above, but I really wouldnt let you be put off by that! We will definetely be staying again next time in London."
161,1129,"Jan 6 2006	Exceeded all expectations	I used the reviews on Trip Advisor to secure this hotel. My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights over the New Year period (Dec. 29-Jan. 3). This was a graduation gift for her. I had planned this trip 6 months earlier. The concierge Ali was outstanding, personable, professional, and handled all my requests. I felt as if I knew him as a friend before my arrival. He was even able to secure a lunch reservation at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant when I asked in the fall! All the other folks were helpful and delightful. Ishita is a gem as well!The hotel was extraordinary! Clean, charming, great location and the most comfy beds!!!!! The bathroom was wonderful with two separate sinks. The housekeeping staff were outstanding.All our questions were handled quickly and with a smile.Complimentary afternoon tea was delightful as well as the evening glass of champagne and sandwiches. I would live here if I could. I will always stay at this hotel when in London and will recommend it to anyone traveling to London!!! They are within easy walking distance to two tube stops but the hotel is in a lovely residential area."
162,1129,"Dec 20 2005	A gem near Paddington.	I'd long been looking for a good hotel near Paddington, an area horribly lacking in decent places to stay. The Royal Park is discreet, gives a friendly, personal welcome (a rare treat in London) and I would thoroughly recommend it. The rooms are nicely done, not huge but then this is London! Breakfast in our room was fresh and just what we needed. One final touch: the porter carried our bag half way to Paddington station - beat that for service!"
163,1129,"Dec 17 2005	Avoid this hotel	We are two professional couples in our sixties who have travelled extensively and stayed numerous times in London at hotels such as the Beaufort and the Cranley, as well as at some fine small clubs. Until this most recent trip, we have had wonderful experiences. This is the first time we have felt totally ripped off and treated badly at a London hotel. We stayed for four nights in rooms that were barely bigger than the beds. Access to the &quot;drawing room and library&quot; was limited by the hotel having rented them to some sort of business group, not something one expects to have to deal with at a boutique hotel.Breakfast each morning arrived on time but was rarely what we ordered. &quot;Pastries&quot; consisted of a single and very small sweet roll.Promised high-speed internet access came only after some discussion and a young employee, trying to be helpful, having to ask the manager for permission. The manager was unfriendly to the point of being virtually hostile. The &quot;flat-screen satellite television&quot; is about twelve inches.Nice sheets and fancy toiletry samples just don't go far enough to make this a worthwhile experience. At $275 a night, touted by the hotel to be a bargain package, in an inconvenient area, this is a hotel to be avoided."
164,1129,"Dec 10 2005	Bliss!	I am a Londoner and this was second stay at this hotel. On this occasion I stayed at this hotel with my mother and two sisters (we were going to the theatre). If you like small boutique hotels (rather than the bland business class hotels) this is the place to stay in London. It is a beautiful Georgian house with fires in the lounge and reception area. When we returned from the theatre, my mother, sisters and I had hot chocolate around the fireplace. I was so happy that they thought that the Royal Park was fantastic as well.The staff are incredible friendly (believe me, this is rare in London) and the hotel is so clean! The famous sherry, scones and tea are a wonderful treat.I would agree with a previous reviewer that you will need to print out a map for the black cab drivers as the hotel is set back from the road and they seem to find it difficult to locate."
165,1129,"Dec 5 2005	Extremely pleased	This was our first trip outside of the U.S. We planned a week in London followed by a week in NYC at the Warwick. We arrived in London at 7am from Texas so we expected to store our luggage before checking in at 3pm. When we arrived, the concierge helped us unload our things and insisted on bringing them inside for us. We asked if we could leave them until check-in but he said that he would have us in a room right now. In the next 5 days, we felt right at home. Everything was nice and spotless. The staff was very courteous and willing to do anything. The room was smaller than we're used to but we have no complaints. Everything was great as far as we were concerned. We stayed in NYC at the Warwick and really have no complaints but it doesn't compare to our experience at the Royal Park. I would go there again without hesitation."
166,1129,"Nov 26 2005	Skip the Cranley and go their partner hotel the Royal Park	Once again, we had a lovely time in our second stay at the Royal Park. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an immaculate, lovely spot with the comforts and personal touch of a small hotel. This is not a place for large hotel experience seekers and those wanting to be right in the action of London...it IS a place for people who appreciate a warm welcome, spotless and beautiful accommodations, easy access to Paddington and Hyde Park, and lovely touches like complimentary tea and scones, champagne and a charming breakfast room service. We were greeted warmly by Bryon, who went far beyond the call of duty to assist us with reservations, offer refreshments, run for taxis and simply check on our needs. For the second year in a row, we were delighted by the personal touch and warmth of the Royal Park staff. After a highly disappointing experience at The Cranley, the better located partner hotel to the Royal Park, we opted without pause to return to the Royal Park. These two hotels may look almost identical in their decor, but their similarities end there. In our experience, The Royal Park is the infinitely better choice of the two -- a welcoming spot, versus a cold shoulder."
167,1129,"Oct 3 2005	Royal Park - Great Value Great Service	My husband and I recently stayed at the Royal Park for two days based on reviews found here and were not disappointed. The room was arguably the cleanest hotel room I have ever stayed in, especially the bathroom - so clean that I actually took a bubble bath both nights, something I NEVER do in hotel bathrooms.The rooms were spacious and the bed was fantastic, and the service at the front desk was friendly and would do just about anything for you. When we arrived (early in the morning, and they checked us in right away), someone accompanied us up to the room and must have spent 10-15 minutes going through the room in detail - where the robes were, how to use the phone, how breakfast was served, etc. It was excessive but very endearing and made us feel totally comfortable.We got a rate of 150 pounds per night, which we discovered was an absolute bargain for what other hotels were charging and based on how nice the hotel was (we met friends there who were at a Thistle that wasn't close to as nice as the Royal Park and cost about 50 pounds more per night). I have not a negative thing to say about the property except it's very, very hard to find. Our taxi driver struggled for a few minutes and friends who live in London who came to get us for brunch couldn't find it despite the fact that they got married in a church that was practically across the street. If you are going to stay there, print out a map that you can show to your taxi driver. It's also not the greatest location in London but close to a tube stop and Hyde Park was right there.All in all I would highly recommend this hotel - it's worth the money and just an all around fantastic place to stay."
168,1129,"Oct 2 2005	Outstanding Hotel in London	(This is a long review.)My wife and I spent seven days at the Royal Park Hotel and enjoyed immensely the way the concierge staff treated us, helped us with our questions and even put in that extra effort to impress the hell out of us when least expected. The rooms we were in (and we saw two of them, which we will explain as you read on) were clean, comfortable and what I expected when staying in London. The location of the hotel is what sold me because of its easy acces to Paddington Station, which is less than a 5 minute walk, and Lancaster Gate Underground, which is less than a 3 minute walk.We returned from the Royal Park Hotel from my honeymoon and stayed in room 301 (see room key picture for proof). We were there Sept. 19-25. We got to the hotel early, around 10 am. I didn't know that check in was at 3 pm, so the concierge who was on duty that morning whose name is Ali (this guy rocks) let us into a room to freshen up. I think he got in trouble for it because they had to clean the room afterward. We were more than willing to wait in the lobby for our room. It was our fault for coming early. So plan ahead and remember check in at the Royal Park Hotel is at 3 pm. Don't expect them to help you out like they did for us. On the way up the elevator, Ali mentioned that we should ask for the complimentary sherry or whiskey when we check in. Ask for the complimentary things, you shouldn't have to, but ask anyway -- you paid for it! We were only in the room for a few minutes, but when we decided on leaving our bags downstairs to get familar with the area around the hotel in daylight, the staff was more than willing to keep our bags in a locked room next to the concierge desk. I felt completely safe with my bags there.We arrived back about 5 pm (after an afteroon at the British Museum) and checked in. But alas, I forgot to ask for the complimentary sherry/whiskey. We were given room 301 (see picture for proof). I've read reviews about the infamous room 307, which was right down the hall from us. I heard some noise from the people upstairs walking around, but nothing to complain about. The bedroom and the bathroom were both clean. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. The curtains kept the light out at night and during the day. The bathroom water pressure was what you would get in the U.S. and the hot water was constant. There were times when you got a rush of extra hot water for a few seconds. But not enough to burn you or to force you to adjust the water temperature while showering. The rack where the towels are hung is heated, which was way cool. It is a hot-towel rack, so you may want to keep little children away from it. We were given fresh towels each day. We brought our own toiletries. If you are relying on hotels to provide you with bottles of shampoo or soap, you will have traveled unprepared. The view from the room was cool, I wasn't expecting to look over a gratto or anything, but it was a view of London and I liked it. I didn't think to take pictures of the first room we were in, but it had the same bed and similar view out the window. The concierge staff at the hotel is competent and helpful when you ask them questions. Kudos go to Ali, who put us in a room to relax while we were waiting for check in. To Byron, for running (I am not making this up) from the hotel to the Lancaster Hotel three blocks away to give us our part of our tour bus ticket. It turns out that part of the ticket wasn't needed by the tour bus company, but Byron went way beyond what was needed. I was so shocked by his effort I forgot to tip him. I did tip him the next day to his gracious disapproval. The rest of the concierge staff helped us with where to eat, taking care of purchasing bus tours for us, how to get to places and what things we should do during our stay. There was one time where I felt one of the staff was kind of grumpy, but I just asked my questions and he answered it and off my wife and I went. Also, when we first got to the hotel, Ali ran outside to help us carry our bags in.The hotel locks the front door at night so as to keep out people not staying there. I liked this added security. It made my wife and I feel safe. Also, you can't leave with your room key. Actually, you don't want to leave with the key because it is heavy (and huge!). (see picture) Just leave it at the desk and pick it up when you return.The hotel is a little hard to find for a couple of reasons: 1) Street signs are hard to find (there usually attached to the buildings) and 2) We weren't familar with London or the area.So to help you people out there, I am giving you the directions we took from Paddington station to the Royal Park. Prepare to cut and paste.If you are coming from Paddington Station, exit to Praed St. We went out a big opening from the station directly from leaving the Heathrow Express train. It will look like a cobble street leading up to the outside. There will be a red mailbox on the left side of the entrance/exit and the Paddington Station Underground entrance on the right. When you get to street level, there will be a hotel on your right that is connected to the station. You want to go across the street and turn right keeping the train station and hotel on your right side. The first street you come up to is Spring Street. (This is the street where I could not find a street sign for and thus got a little lost the first time around.) Cross the street where the red and black pub is (I think it's called the Paddignton Station Pub) and turn left. The train station should be behind you to your left when you get to the other side. The pub on the corner has wooden tables outside and specials written on the chalkboard. (NOTE: Praed Street turns into Carven Street if you don't make the left turn.) Now, go all the way down the street until it intersects with a street called Sussex Gardens. Turn right on Sussex Gardens and there should be a row of houses on either side of you. You could probably see a church and a park directly ahead. Continue down this street staying in front of the row of houses on your right. Keep following the row of white houses, keeping them on your right as you walk down the street and get closer to the church and park that will be on your left. The park is called Sussex Gardens Park. Keep the row of houses on your right constantly even when the houses start to curve to the right right. The church and park will be behind you when you make that gradual turn. There should be a fence with bushes growing on them and trees on your left. The Royal Park Hotel will be the one with the gold placards on the white Romanesque columns. Written on them is the name of the hotel, Royal Park Hotel. The street on the other side of the trees, fence and bushes is Westbourne Terrace. If for some reason you get to the end of row of houses, turn around and go back toward the park and church and look again. I hope that helps. There will be a picture of the church and park from the side you need to be on. If you do get lost, ask for directions to Sussex Gardens Park, since this park is directly across the street from the hotel.Pictures of the hotel, room, bathroom, view outside the widows, the park and church directly across the street from the hotel are part of this review.This London hotel is well worth the price, and if you want to experience the city, stay at the Royal Park. My wife and I were extremely pleased by our stay there. We will go back there again. I would also use TripAdvisor again when researching hotels."
169,1129,Sep 19 2005	Loved the Royal Park	I recently stayed at the Royal Park for 4 nights in September. I chose this hotel because of the location to Paddington Station. It was great for an ealy flight out via the Heathrow Express. This isn't a hotel for you if you are looking for a resort type hotel. But perfect for you if want a very clean and comfortable place to stay. The service was outstanding! Breakfast was brought to our room on time every morning served on china with nice cloth napkins. The same for the wonderful afternoon tea. The bathroom was very nice with huge fluffy bath sheets. I was very satisifed and would stay there again.
170,1129,"Sep 18 2005	My favorite noew hotel	This was our first stop on our UK and Ireland trip that we returned from yesterday. This hotel was the highlight of our lodgings. We had room 101 and were pleased with the size and heard no noise from other guests. The wondow faced the center of the block and was right above a little court yard that the staff used to take their breaks in. We did smell smoke from their breaks time to time but not strongly and we're very sensitive to that.The bed was wonderful, I think it may be the finest mattress I have ever slept on. Soft yet firm, the perfect pillow top. I wish I had one at home.The bathroom was spotlessly clean and so tasteful. I really enjoyed long showers in there. I also was blown away by the towels. I am a plus sized woman and I was able to wrap my self up in the thick bath towels. They were close to what we call a bath sheet in the US, what a luxury as were the slippers.We also loved the breakfasts with the cute little silver domes over our butter. We loved taking it in our room. It would have ben very welcome later in our visit as we were served the full English, Irish, Scottish breakfast everywhere else and craved something lighter like we had at the Royal Park. The staff was wonderful and very helpful.We were so glad that we canceled our original hotel and went with this based on TA reviews. This was the perfect hotel for us!"
171,1129,"Sep 18 2005	Nice but not a ""luxury"" property	Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Royal Park. I had purchased the 4-night package from LuxuryLink and was really looking forward to my stay given the reviews on this website and the association with LuxuryLink. I was sorely disappointed.This hotel is indeed pretty difficult to find if you are not very familiar with the Lancaster Gate area north of Hyde Park. It is in a series of white townhouses set off from main roads in a pretty non-descript street. After traveling for 16 hours, I was really looking forward to all the &quot;luxury&quot; touches that had been advertised by both the hotel and LuxuryLink. I am still waiting for them.There was absolutely no acknowledgement at check-in that this reservation was under the LuxuryLink program. After looking back at the LuxuryLink auction offer and comparing it with the hotels'website, the package did not offer anything &quot;extra&quot; than what the hotel already supposedly offers all of its guests. We were not offered the welcome drink of sherry or port. Granted, it was 9 a.m. London time and we likely would have declined but I thought it was pretty shabby that they did not even acknowledge that it was a perk of staying there. Could they not have offered to provide the welcome drink later on in the first day as a courtesy? This was just the beginning of situations throughout the stay where you practically had to beg for services that are standard at true luxury hotels.We were given Room 307, which has been mentioned before on this thread fairly recently. It is an executive double room with a king bed. Again, the LuxuryLink package indicated that a Four-poster king bed room would be provided if it was available upon check-in. They didn't even say &quot;I am sorry, but one is not available, is the executive double room suitable?&quot; We figured out that the ugrade was not provided as soon as we opened the door to the room. The room was OK, nothing to write home about. Surely not a luxury room in my opinion.The air conditioning never really cooled the room to temperatures we are used to. We had it set at its coolest setting and there were nights where we had to sleep without covers because it was uncomfortably warm otherwise. As previously mentioned with Room 307, you can hear EVERYTHING that the people in the room upstairs are doing. I heard this businesman's conversation one night verbatim, as if he were sitting on the other side of my room and not upstairs in his. You would have thought a herd of elephants were inhabiting the room upstairs by the amount of noise you heard. . .moving around, dropping things, slapping doors. The bathroom was fine. Shower pressure came and went in spurts resulting in a shower that was not truly relaxing. At least it was warm water, so I cannot complain about everything. The bathroom was, however, the site of the tackiest &quot;luxury&quot; touch this hotel afforded its guests. Yes, you have Penhalion products in the bathroom. But we had to call down to the desk several times during our stay because the housekeeping staff apparently does not feel it necessary to provide you with new toiletries if they see that you still have 1/2 or 1/4 of your current bottle of shampoo, body wash, etc. Tacky tacky tacky. As for the breakfast, it was delivered to the room on time in the mornings. You can select as many things as you want from a continental breakfast menu. This was probably my favorite thing about this hotel. The front desk staff at this hotel was uninformed and out of touch with the needs of &quot;luxury&quot; property travelers. One individual couldn't tell me how to get to a restaurant, even though I had an address and the closest metro stop to the location to provide him as start-up information. Another sent us to a slummy part of SoHo for dinner when we asked for a restaurant that had excellent food but was casual in atmosphere. The restaurant was right in the middle of the nastiest part of SoHo, reaked of smoke and the menu looked like it belonged at a Longhorn Steak Restaurant. As you came and went, the staff barely acknowledged you more than to hand you the key. I was starting to wonder if I smelled.The hotel is located a few blocks from the Lancaster Gate tube stop and a few blocks in the other direction from Paddington Station, where you can get the Heathrow Express to the airport.Overall, we were very disappointed with this hotel given the expectations that had been set by the hotel's own website and advertisements, as well as its association with LuxuryLink. We will definitely choose another hotel for our next stay in London. Decorating a place nicely does not a luxury hotel make."
172,1129,"Sep 12 2005	Beautiful but noisy!	We stopped in room 307 at this Hotel on a Wednesday night to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was immaculate, staff were excellent and the little extras that they gave us made us feel we were stopping at a top quality hotel. The only complaint that we had was the acoustics in the hotel. We were woken very early in the morning by the people in the room above us, and we could hear everthing ranging from the tv to them talking on the phone. It was was a real shame that this spoiled our trip as this is otherwise and excellent hotel!"
173,1129,"Aug 23 2005	Loved the Werthers and everything else	After a somewhat difficult time finding the Royal Park, as it is not that well know among London cab drivers and its outward appearance is not particularly opulent, we were pleasantly surprised upon entry. From the instant we arrived, we were treated like royalty by the extremely helpful staff. Our room was not only spacious for a European hotel room but also beautifully appointed with local treasures. Everything from the bed to the water pressure in the shower was worthy of a five star rating. The only downside to our entire stay was that the Royal Park would not allow a third person in the room."
174,1129,"Aug 16 2005 	High service standards great attitude 	No need to go into more detail other than to support the many excellent reviews...This hotel achieves the simple perfection of high service standards, a great attitude toward its guests and good value for money. How easy it would be for others to emulate this combination, but how few ever seem to attempt it. The location of The Royal Park may not be the best in London, but it seems insignificant when you can enjoy the level of personal service available at this property. Other hotel managers and staff should be sent to The Royal Park for training!"
175,1129,"Jul 12 2005	A Simply Charming Hotel	A recently-renovated boutique hotel w/fairly small but lovely rooms and immaculate bathrooms. The staff was helpful and arranged for us to have breakfast and tea in one of the downstairs parlors rather than our rooms. (Our family of 4 was in 2 separate rooms.) Beds were very comfortable and linens and towels were spotless. Location (near Paddington) was convenient. One quibble: we were in London during the recent heatwave and rooms, while air conditioned, were still on the warm side. (Of course, few places in London are prepared for several days of 90-degree weather.) I would definitely return again."
176,1129,"Jul 11 2005	Awesome	We can say nothing wrong with the hotel. It is spotless, well appointed and the staff was extremely attentive and helpful. The rooms are victorian small but wonderfully appointed. Ronan at the front desk made sure every detail was looked after. Highly recommended and would stay again."
177,1129,"Jul 6 2005	What a Great Find!!!	I stayed at the Royal Park hotel for 2 nights in May. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. It is a small quaint hotel with a lot of charm and very comfortable. It was probably the best hotel we stayed at during our 3 week European trip. The hotel is located 3 blocks from Paddington Station, which makes for a very convenient commute from Heathrow Airport via the Heathrow Express. The neighborhood is great...with a variety of restaurants, pubs and stores...and Hyde Park is 2 blocks away! Can't beat the location...The hotel itself is beautifully decorated yet small...the staff are extremely attentive and helpful, with suggestions for things to do and where to eat! Our room was very clean, and the bathroom was beautiful! (be careful not to burn yourself on the tower warmer!!) THe bed was SOOO comfortable...I didn't want to leave!I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here agaiN!"
178,1129,"Jun 30 2005 	Highly Recommended	We stayed one night here recently during a heatwave in London (the air conditioning in the room was superb) and were delighted! We booked via the hotel's own website and received a last minute price for an executive king, which was cheaper than any of the discount hotel sites. When you take into account what was included in the rate - continental breakfast served in your room, newspaper, scones in the afternoon, and champagne and canapes in the evening - we got a bargain! The room was large by London standards, huge king bed with good linen, flat screen TV, good storage and everything was spotless (believe me, I don't say that lightly, I've been know to moan about dusty light bulbs!). Staff were great, very warm and helpful. It took about 25 minutes to walk to Selfridges, what more could you want! We will be back and have already sent some friends to stay."
179,1129,"Jun 20 2005	Fantastic place to stay	From the moment, we arrived I thought this hotel was going to be special. Firstly it's easy to find, straight off the A40 into London. A good start. Secondly a parking space directly outside (which costs 30) to leave the car for the whole of the weekend - a bargain in London.Then into the hotel itself. A gorgeous little hotel, with friendly staff and lovely rooms. They even brought the scones to our room.This hotel is fantastically located, a gentle stroll from Oxford street or a mere stones throw from Lancaster Gate tube, giving you access to the whole of London. I could go on for days about how great the hotel is but I'm sure that you are getting the picture. I will be back here.Lastly the hotel's own website gave me the cheapest rate of all the online sites (laterooms, lastminute etc etc). Plus included breakfast."
180,1129,"Jun 15 2005	A wonderful place to stay	We booked a four night stay through LuxuryLink. Rather than treating us as &quot;second-class&quot; citizens, they upgraded us to a nicer room and allowed us to check in at 9am after an over-night flight. The room was wonderful, as were the breakfast and champagne brought up to our room every day. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and the location was very convenient in terms of proximity to Paddington Station and the underground. We would definitely stay there again, and have already recommended it to several of our friends."
181,1129,"May 11 2005	Great!	Great hotel, worth the money- very helpful and friendly staff, tasteful decor, and great location. Will definatley stay there again!"
182,1129,"May 7 2005	Sublimely Comfortable Rooms Fabulous Staff	My husband and I stayed at the Royal Park for 5 nights in September 2004. It was a divine experience. I've never encountered such a friendly and generous staff. The desk clerks were wonderful and the concierge was fabulous. This hotel did so many favors for us, I couldn't possibly list them all. We had only to mention a dilemma and they jumped into action to help us find a solution. We had a beautiful suite; the four-poster bed was supremely comfortable, the white linens crisp and fresh, the pillows plentiful and fluffy. The bed was a luscious cocoon of comfort. We could hardly bring ourselves to leave the room. Luckily they have a small but interesting room service menu, which was a welcome convenience and quite good enough. The breakfast was included in our rate and it was plentiful and tasty, brought each morning on a lovely tray. The bathroom was beautiful with very high quality fixtures, an enormous long tub, thick white towels, first-rate and plentiful toiletries. This is a small townhouse hotel, no grand lobby but nice small sitting rooms on the first floor. The location is quite convenient, easy walking distance to Paddington Station, Lancaster Gate tube stop, and Kensington Gardens. We traveled in England for 7 weeks and the Royal Park was certainly one of the high points of our entire trip. The only, and very minor, criticism was that at times the staff seemed a little disconnected, as in the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing. The room service people, in particular, seemed a little off the mark. This never resulted in any real inconvenience for us; however, a stronger central management and better communication among the staff could have made this first-rate hotel experience even more enjoyable. We absolutely loved the Royal Park; thank you to all the staff for a marvelous holiday."
183,1129,"May 6 2005	Fabulous Hotel	I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor - and I am so pleased that I did.The hotel was fabulous. We had a double room which we found to be a good size [some reviewers found the rooms to be small!!], the bathroom is georgous and the mini penhaligan toiletries a real treat. I think this has to be one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in.The staff are friendly and accommodating but not over powering and breakfast served in your room is a real treat.The location is superb with everything you could need on your door step [Paddington Express, Underground Station, Hyde Park etc].Will definately return."
184,1129,"Feb 15 2005	great boutique hotel	My family stayed at this hotel at the end of October 2004. What a treat! We had been traveling through various countries in europe for six weeks and arrived late in the evening. The rooms are exquisite and beautifully scented. Bathrooms are gorgeous, newly renovated and very clean with penthaligons toileteries. Beds had plenty of down filled pillows and comfy duvets. It was like coming home. The staff was very accomodating for breakfast and arranged for us to dine in the dining room as there was six of us. An absolutely perfect stay to the final few days of our vacation."
185,1129,"Feb 7 2005	A Happy Holiday!	Our family stayed at the Royal Park Hotel just after Christmas through New Year's. We very much echo the positive feedback here on TripAdvisor, and would highly recommend this hotel for those in search of a cozy, neighborhood type of place. Our room was a one-bedroom suite so there was plenty of room for my husband, myself and our 10 yr old. Do take advantage of local restaurants, shops (snacks for the room) laundromat, and the UnderGround which is literally four blocks away. The staff, Peter especially, just can't do enough for you, and they always have recommendations (food, tours, what-to-do) readily available. We exchanged several E-Mails before leaving the States so restaurant reservations, tours, etc. were all in place before we arrived. When back in London, I expect this is where we'll return to."
186,1129,"Jan 31 2005	Great Find/Wonderful service	My fiance and I stayed here from Jan 21-24th, 2005. We arrived on a red-eye flight at 8am, and the hotel allowed us to check in early without any complications. Our top floor room was small yet clean and well decorated. I read in other reviews that the advantage of the top floor is that it is quieter. My only complaint was that there was only a skylight in the room, which was a bit claustrophobic. True, we were paying one of lower rates, but the hotel was only 1/2 full. It was not a pressing issue. We were there to sightsee rather than spend all day at the hotel, so we didn't bother to change rooms nor mention it to the hotel staff. The lamps and recessed lighting (on dimmers) were really very nice in the room.The bathroom was huge relative to the bedroom. There was always hot water and great water pressure. The tub was deep tub/shower, except, the 1/3 stationary, glass partition was sort of odd rather than a shower curtain or sliding glass doors. The towel warmer was a nice touch.The hotel is right by Paddington Station, which made it an easy trip on the Heathrow Express. If you don't have a lot of luggage, you can easily walk to the hotel. Don't take a cab from Paddington, which we did. It was such a short ride; it was laughable. The Bayswater location has some restaurants and shops, and it is convenient to Notting Hill. You really have to hop in a taxi or on the tube to get to most places, though.The distnctive, standout quality of The Royal Park Hotel is the staff. They are very friendly, helpful, warm and accommodating. During our 4 nights there, we really felt very comfortable. The decor is traditional yet far from stuffy and the whole place has an unassuming grace. We missed the afternoon tea served in the parlors, but we did catch the champagne in the evening. The room service menu is limited but the food was very good and works for a late night bite. We ordered breakfast, as well, but realized it was far better and more economical to get our coffee/tea/croissant, etc. at the local shops. The fact that the hotel had a very decent rate (esp. with the dollar being so weak) was just an added bonus to this exceptionally wonderful, quaint hotel."
187,1129,"Jan 9 2005	Great Hotel and People	My wife and I stayed at the Royal Park Hotel for 4 nights in December 2004. We highly recommend this hotel. I wont duplicate all the positive comments the other guests have made on this site, but I concur. Additionally, we arrived at 8 AM and check-in was not until 3 PM. They had a room ready for us at no extra cost for which we were very grateful after a 10 hour flight from the US. The room is as others have described, very clean and new looking. The linens were top notch and the bed was very comfortable. All personnel were friendly and helpful. One thing. Ask for a room with no one above you. Some guests have complained of people moving around in the middle of the night making noise that comes through the ceiling. I asked and received a top room. Tea and scones, and champagne in the evening were great. Remember, London is expensive. Most things are about double as the same in the states when exchange rate is $1.95 or so per English pound. There are lots of places to eat around the hotel. There is even a McDonalds and Burger King within a 5 minute walk. We tried the continental breakfast at the hotel one time. It was not really worth 10 pounds per person. This breakfast was the only thing that was not superior during our stay at the hotel. However, I would gladly stay there again, anytime.Tips: Book a car through an internet site to pick you up at the airport. It will be cheaper than a taxi that costs 40+ pounds and the driver will meet you in the airport. Take the tube when you can. We took it to Harrods twice. We had to change trains twice each way but it beat an expensive taxi. Book theater tickets well in advance (at least 2-3 months). I also recommend the dinner cruise on the Thames. Lots of sights with music on the boat after dinner. Also, we always stay at an airport hotel the last night before our flight back to the States. This allows us to be at the airport without having to brave the traffic from London to Heathrow on the day of travel. I highly recommend the Crown Plaza Heathrow (the one on Stockley Road, West Drayton). It costs 3 pounds for the van ride to the airport from this hotel but the hotel is a large, American style hotel with large rooms. The bed was comfortable with a large bathroom. Plenty of room service and the burger was good."
188,1129,"Jan 7 2005	A Great Stay - Thanks Tripadvisor	We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. Good breakfast, enjoyable tea in the afternoon. Friendly staff and we really like our room. Enough closet and drawer space and a large bathroom. A little bit out of the way, but not bad. Look forward to going back again. I mixed business with pleasure. Beware, high speed internet connection is over $20 per day."
189,1129,"Dec 31 2004	A charming hotel	We stayed at this hotel in September 2004. I booked it strictly on reviews from this website, as I had never heard of it before. It was number 1 at the time. Upon arrival, it wasn't quite what I had expected. It was much smaller and unassuming. Despite whatever expectations I had, it was a lovely hotel which I would highly recommend. Our room, although small, was very clean, beautifully decorated, had fine linens, a comfy bed and gorgeous bathroom with Penhaligon toiletries. The view was not the greatest, as it overlooked a bunch of other buildings and rooftops, but perhaps this is what you'd expect in a large, old city. The staff were very friendly and we enjoyed champagne and crudites in the evening. Overall, I would certainly stay here again. It's a beautiful, small, quaint hotel that lived up to its good reputation."
190,1129,"Dec 28 2004	Classy boutique hotel with great location	I stayed at The Royal Park for 10 nights in October 2004, based on the reviews from tripadvisor. I do like this hotel because of the terrific location and warm atmosphere but the service left little to be desired. I booked a double executive room and was given a twin room. When I complained, they finally fixed it 2 nights later. However, they made me look at over 5 rooms before they finally gave me the room I originally booked - they continuously tried to place me in a small, dark, basement room. Would I stay there again? Probably, but like the other reviewer stated I would be prepared to stay elsewhere if they refused to give me the room I originally booked. They need to get their act together."
191,1129,Dec 27 2004	Luxury in the City	We stayed at the Royal Park for three nights in November and were totally spoiled! The bed was so luxurious. And the little extras are marvellous. A great location from which to explore London. Definitely recommended!
192,1129,"Dec 24 2004	cozy and quiet	My sister and i stayed for 4 nights (10th-14th of Dec) through a auction bid we had won on luxurylink(this is the best rate/offer you will find)that included an executive room with all taxes, continental breakfast, complimentary canapes, tea, and champagne in the hotel lounge. The best thing about our stay is that it was quiet, great beds and linens to sleep on( i don't think i have ever had a better sleep), and the slippers bathrobe, hot pressurized showers and warm fluffy towels with mini toilettries were really a great bonus after a full day of seeing the sights. Breakfast was also very generous in terms of proportions and is served in your room. Hotel location is another bonus; hyde park/kensigton, oxford street, oh and the metro is right at the end of the road( use the metor to get around london very convenient and takes no time at all to understand). Peter at the reception is the person that really stood out as the friendliest when we were there and his assistance in all matters was really great. Our room was cozy with its own sitting area that also had an additional flat screen besides the one in the bedroom area. If you like small, cozy, intimate hotels this is the best place to come to. Will be back for sure if i am ever back in london on vacation. the only problem i had was during check-in, the staff were a little confused and unorganized they even forgot to offer us our complimentary drinks. Our room was also not ready even though i had contacted the reservations prior to my arrival to indicate that we will be checking in early. but this was resolved an hour later and did not interfere with our overall experience with the hotel. Enjoyed this hotel more than the cranley(sister property) because of the quiet factor."
193,1129,"Dec 13 2004	Nice Hotel - with a Caveat	Based upon the reviews on this site, my wife and I stayed at the Royal Park hotel for six nights. With a caveat, it was an excellent stay. We booked an Executive Double with a King size bed through the Romantic Getaway package. The room we eventually got was average size, with high ceilings and absolutely immaculate. The bed was perfect, plenty of storage, flat screen tv, etc. The bathroom was modern with a great shower. Maid service was perfect. The only nits to pick with the room was that there is no clock, only one sink in the bathroom, and the hair dryer did not have an outlet in the bathroom. It was a ground floor room, with a view of a brick wall, but someone has to have a ground floor room. The continental breakfast was included and was very good. The afternoon tea and scones are as advertised as was the evening champaign and canapes. The concierge and desk staff, with one exception, was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.Now the caveat. We arrived early, around 11:00 a.m. After waiting in a study, we were led to room 107. It was extremely small, with a double size bed. There literally was no room to walk around the room. According to the book &quot;Best Loved Hotels of the World&quot;, the Royal Park has 2 single rooms, 15 doubles, 18 Executive Doubles/Twins 2 Four-posters and 11 suites. This room was a single. When we complained to the manager, we were shown a double, but with a queen size bed. It was a standard double. The manager tried to tell us that this was a king size bed. I told the manager that we had stayed at in London on at least four other occasions and had king size beds, and that the two rooms we were shown did not have a king size bed. After about a ten minute delay, we were finally shown the room we stayed in, which is what we reserved: an Executive Double with a King size bed. I understand that it may be standard operating procedure at many hotels to attempt to downsize a customers reservation. It is not unique at the Royal Park. However, they should deliver what was promised at the agreed upon price. If we hadn't made clear that we were prepared to go to a different hotel, we would have been relegated to a single standard room from an executive double with a king size bed.Why the five star rating? Because if you get what you bargained for, the Royal Park is superb. If you do not get what you bargained for, it is a zero. The next time in London, I will make reservations at the Royal Park. However, I will have checked websites before getting on the plane and have a back-up plan."
194,1129,"Dec 12 2004	Royal Park - Thanks Tripadvisor	Like many of these reviewers we based our honeymoon hotel on reviews in Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. The Royal Park's staff is terrific, the perks are great - yes you may need to ask for the champagne but it is quickly and gracefully provided -, the rooms small but terrific and the location can't be beat. Thanks Royal Park for a wonderful visit."
195,1129,"Dec 8 2004	Royal Park Hotel	We stayed here in Oct. based on reviews here. It was great. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location of the hotel was great for walking and the tube. There were 3 adult women and we stayed in a one bedroom suite, which was very small-but I guess all the hotel rooms are in London. The afternoon scones and tea was a great break! Plus you can have them in your room if you want. The beds were EXCELLENT!"
196,1129,"Dec 6 2004	Great Location Great Hotel	I have been traveling for over 25 years in over 49 countries, and this was one of the most pleasant hotel stays I have ever had. Taking this website's recommendation, I was booked several times at this hotel in early October during stays in London. I was traveling on business and so I would have to leave for a day here or there for meetings in other parts of Europe. The staff was extremely helpful with doing laundry and keeping my bags while I went out of town. Whenever I cam back to the hotel it was like coming home. All the staff knew my name by my second stay, and even upgraded me for free when there was availability. Every evening I enjoyed a glass of champagne with canaps, and there was no negativity about this. My room was plenty large, everything was in working order, and very new and clean feeling. Other hotels in London, with larger rooms do not feel is clean or new. I held business meetings in their dinning room, and there was no charge for this and the staff was very flexible when meeting times would change. There were many recommendations for local restaurants from the front desk. The staff is very friendly and professional. The other great fantastic feature of this hotel is the location. If you fly into Heathrow, you can take the Heathrow Express directly to Paddington Station, 15 minute ride. The Royal Park is a 3 minute walk from there, just around the corner! From Heathrow to your hotel in 20 minutes!!! This is unheard of in London. Also, if you like to jog and work out, there is a free membership at a very nice gym just a 5 minute walk away. It has a pool, hot tub, lots of free weights and cardio, nautilus, steam and sauna!! I don't think many people even know this about this hotel. Also, Hyde Park is a 2 minute walk away which has endless jogging and walking paths. This hotel is not a Hilton or a Renaissance Marriot. The hallways are tight and every room uniquely designed. Some of the floors creak a bit and there is no gigantic lobby to hang around in (although the parlor is nice and cozy). My room was impeccable all the time. All my laundry came back perfect, and I didn't make it easy for them. Often I would leave for a couple of days and say &quot;all the clothes in the closet are dirty, could you have them cleaned for when I come back in a few days.&quot; When I came back all the laundry was in my closet, all perfect, nothing ever missing. The only improvement I suggest is extending the room service menu. Although, for such a small hotel (40 rooms I think) to have 24hr room service is a feat in itself! Great job Royal Park! I will definitely come back &quot;home&quot; on my next trip in January!"
197,1129,"Nov 30 2004	Fab find	I discovered this hotel on this website and based on the reviews took a chance. It was everything I was seeking: great location, beautiful hotel, romantic, and wonderful personnel. I had requested a four poster bed for a romantic weekend over Thanksgiving. This trip was a surprise for my significant's birthday. We only had one glitch but it was corrected as soon as I explained my hopes and expectations. Upon arrival I was shown a room in the lower level which was quite small and faced the brick wall. I have been told by other hotels the best rooms are reserved for those booking directly through the hotel's website. I had booked the room through Hotels.com and received a discounted rate. No matter, the staff were accommodating and responsive; they provided an upgrade. We received a junior suite on the second floor with a sunny view. This hotel provides ambience and service, service and more service. They booked our dinner reservations, flagged taxis, and made excellent recommendations. The little extras are such a treat: afternoon tea, champagne before dinner and hors d'oeuvres. We plan to go back to London and we'll definitely plan to stay here again."
198,1129,"Nov 29 2004	Great find!	We stayed 9 nights at the Royal Park and found it to be a wonderful choice for us. The bed was very comfortable with lovely linens, the towels were thick and thirsty and the room was very clean and well decorated, though small. We had hot water and found the staff friendly contrary to other tripadvisor reviews. They did not offer us whiskey on arrival and we did have to ask for the tea and champagne but they always brought it and we just decided that was what was expected. The hotel is very close to Paddington Station. (Same block as the Pride of Paddington Pub which is just across the street from the station. Opposite side of the block) It isn't that easy to find since it looks like all of the other townhouses on the street, but it is well located for two tube stops and Hyde Park.We did hear noises from the people above us, but it didn't keep us awake. We would stay there again."
199,1129,"Nov 23 2004	Decent 4 star hotel	Stayed on night at the Royal Park, got the best weekend-deal from their website (1 night for 117 GBP). I arrived quite late and their online credit-card system was not working. That was not very professionel but at least they offered me a drink. Room was excellent and even for a 4 star hotel above average. Breakfast was quite nice as well.  All in all the Royal Park is a nice 4 star hotel, nothing more and nothing less."
200,1129,"Nov 21 2004	Don't go	Don't belive anything of the good reviews. This hotel is overprized with a bad location. Most of the staff are rude (not everybody. Daniel was very nice) and not willing to help you. They don't smile and it looks like they don't like to work in a hotel. You are not offered whisky/sherry when you check in and you have to ask for the tea and champagne. When you ask they act like they don't understand what you mean. The bed is very nice and the room are very clean. So is the bathrobe and the slippers, but that's all. Nice to have breakfast in room. I really regret that I picked this hotel for me and my boyfriend. I will never ever stay at this hotel again."
201,1129,"Nov 19 2004	Convenient clean and comfy	I booked this hotel based on the recommendations at this site and don't regret it. I stayed for 2 nights at the end of October and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was small for two double beds, but it was clean and the beds were comfortable. The safe didn't work at first, but it was fixed soon after we notified the front desk (battery had died) - note: you can lock it with any card that has a magnetic strip, so use your driver's license if you don't want to use a credit card. The bathroom was clean and shower had good water pressure. Contrary to some reviews at this site, I always had hot water. The elevator was very small, but fit three people plus luggage. The hotel is about two short blocks away from Paddington station so it is convenient. I would definitely stay here again."
202,1129,Nov 18 2004	Lovely hotel if you don't mind noise from above	Just returned from a three night stay at the Royal Park Hotel. Excellent location for access to Hyde Park and the Tube. Daniel the conceirge was amazing and managed to book us fantastic theater tickets to a sold out show. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Room decor was lovely and although others had said the rooms were on the small side ours was quite roomy and the bed was very comfortable. Our major complaint with this hotel is the noise from the rooms above. You can hear every footstep and creak in the floor boards. If I stayed here again I would request a room on the 5th floor in the back of the building. The hotel offers sherry upon arrival and a champagne and canapes service in the evening but you won't get it unless you ask which seemed odd to me. There is also a tea service but we were never at the hotel during that time. Overall a lovely hotel if you don't mind the noise.
203,1129,"Nov 17 2004	Not Impressed	This hotel is nothing to write home about. I agree with the other reviews. During my trip in October, I was without hot water, the room was freezing cold and there was no apologies for either problem, other than maintenance would &quot;look into it&quot;. The staff for the most part were friendly and helpful. The rooms are very small, with no alarm clocks and the bathrooms are poorly designed. Sorry, spend your money at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel for double the room size and half the price. I booked my room based on this web site and standards in the hotel must have dropped dramatically."
204,1129,Nov 2 2004	Absolutely wonderful	Stayed three wonderful nites at RPH: 60-second walk from Hyde Park; incredibly professional &amp; friendly staff; ideal neighbourhood; delightful rooms (Executive Double); well worth every pound!! ENJOY!!
205,1129,"Oct 28 2004	Suberb experience	Stayed at the Royal Park hotel with my boyfriend in October. It was a surprise trip for his 30th birthday. Everything was perfect! The staff was attentive, helpful and even surprised him with a bottle of champagne on his birthday that i didn't even arrange for! We stayed in a lovely four poster bed and the room was nicely decorates and very spacious. The best thing with the hotel was the location- so close to Hyde Park and very easy to reach from Heathrow with the express train. I do not understand other peoples bad reviews of this place. You can not get better value for money in London! Complimentary afternoon tea and glass of champagne in the evening was all suberb extras! I am hoping my boyfriend will take us back on my 30th birthday!"
206,1129,"Oct 27 2004	Don't believe the hype.	I'm glad to see some others that don't agree with the raving recommendations.My husband and I just returned from our &quot;last real vacation&quot; before we become parents in January. We wanted to splurge on the whole event and, based on the reviews on tripadvisor, I thought this would be a nice place to stay. To start, I was surprised how stingy they were with the toiletries. I could not get a bar of soap for both the shower and sink, and they did not give me a new bar the whole week. With the shampoos and conditioners they would only give you a new one if you were COMPLETELY out of the old. Seemed such a silly thing to be stingy about.Other complaints: The shower was lukewarm to cold some mornings. There is no alarm clock and it was sometimes difficult for me to contact someone for a wake up call. Our tub didn't drain well and we had to stand in water while showering. The noise at night, with people going up and down the stairs, woke me several times. Some of the restaurant recommendations from the concierge were laughable, but a couple were decent. The positives: It is a nicely decorated and comfortable hotel. The tea and scones were a nice touch. The staff was very nice, they even switched our room because of someone smoking (heavily) on our floor.Overall the Royal Park was okay; not great, not bad. My negatives are only petty little things that made the experience a little less than what I had hoped for. I paid $370/night for an executive double. I don't believe the experience was worth the price, but it is the exchange rate that hurt me. If I were to pay $200/night I might consider staying here again."
207,1129,"Oct 24 2004	Standards must be slipping....	I have to say I was dissapointed, I booked this hotel as a treat for my wife in celebration of our wedding anniversary. Having read all the rave reviews on this site, we were very excited at the prospect of feeling pampered in 5 star luxury. It certainly did not come up to either I or my wiife's expectations.Arrived having walked up and down Westbourne Terrace 3 or 4 times trying to find this place, the only thing that gives you a clue that this place is a hotel is the 6&quot; x 6&quot; brass plaque one of the pillars that you cannot even read from the pavement! The interior of this hotel is very nice, very traditional but because it has been recently refurbished it is not at all shabby and actually feels new. Upon check-in we were NOT offrered the &quot;complimentary&quot; glass of whisky or sherry and not wanting to be a cheapskate and get off on the wrong foot I let this slide. We were shown to our 200 &quot;4 poster suite&quot; which was actually the size of a small standard room in most hotels I have stayed in before. It was decorated very niceley with a very good quality 4 poster bed, however to call this room a suite was just plain exageration. There is a &quot;complimentary&quot; afternoon tea served between 3 - 5pm but as we were making our trip in London to see the matinee showing of a West End show, we arrived back at 5.15 pm, we asked if it might be possible that we could still have the afternoon tea and were refused (so much for going the extra mile !!) We returned to our room to find that there was only luke warm water in which to bathe. Then came the &quot;complimentary&quot; Champagne and apperetiffes, we had to ask for them to be provided, if they are supposed to be available why not make it easy and less embarrasing for guests by asking them instead rather than the other way around, but having missed out on the other two &quot;complimentary&quot; perks I decided to swallow my pride and ask anyway, the champagne was gorgeous, ice colled and not too dry, the apperetiffes were 4 postage stamp sized slices of stale bread with a miniscule slice of salmon on two and some cream cheese on the other two, not praticularly impressive. We went out for a meal at the &quot;Ask&quot; pizzeria just round the block which was excellent value for money with great service, even though it is a chain restaraunt. We returned to the room and settled down in the very comfy bed, howvever a good nights sleep was definatley not what we got, we must have been woken up 5 - 6 times in the night by the sound of people stamping about upstairs. The room became unbearably hot and it was then that we found out that the air conditioning was not working, I literally had to open the window even though we were on street level, so that some fresh air could be let in of course I could not sleep until I closed the window again as we could have had anybody climbing in through the window! In the morning there is no hot water, this time it not even lukewarm, just cold, so I had to have a cold shower and walk off into the a late octobers morning in England (you know what I mean!) The final frustration on checking out was the I found out that the special rate I had found via the Travelocity web site did not include VAT so I had to stump up an extra 35.00 on top of the VERY overpriced 200 I had expected. My final little whinge is that they have parking at the hotel but that is 30.00 per night I know London parking is expensive but that just takes the buscuit! Usreley it shoud be free for paying guests or at least made to be a nominal charge. If you insist on staying at this hotel, make sure you park at the Paddington public car park which works out to be 22.00 per 24 hour period.Overall this is a niceley decorated hotel that could be simply superb is let down by less than attentive staff, poor soundproofing and what must be the original plumbing/hot water heating! I also notice that in the last week or so several bad reviews have been posted on this hotel, maybe they have taken thier eye off the ball!Not recomended."
208,1129,"Oct 24 2004	Our best hotel stay ever!	We stayed in room 205 from october 20th to 23rd. We booked this hotel since we read all the good reviews on this site and we were not dissappointed at all. We made our reservation through travelocity, but when we arrived the hotel staff could not find our reservation. Still, they immediately got us a room similar or better to the one we had booked. Excellent service.The room was, simply put, outstanding. It was quite spacious and the bed and bathroom were both great. We also had a small adjoining room (it was a suite) where we enjoyed our breakfast and complementary afternoon tea. Room service was prompt and very nice. Both the bedroom and the adjoining room had flat screen televisions. I also had use for the broadband internet connection and it worked great. All this for GBP200 a night!On out first night we asked for restaurant recommendations, and we were sent of to Island restaurant, just a few steps away. It was fantastic. The food and wine was excellent; so much in fact, that we went there a gain for our last night. Great food, excellent service and for a reasonable price. Highly recommended.Our concierge Daniel was great. Always helpful and spot on with his recommendations.We will most certainly be back to this hotel i London for our next visit there.You won't find better value for money than this in central London."
209,1129,"Oct 21 2004	Average at best	We just returned from our stay at th Royal Park Hotel. I must say this hotel is average at best. You can hear the people above you stomping around. Every morning the hot water would turn luke warm. I also have a recommendation for the hotel &quot;mini bar&quot;. The restaurant recommendations by the staff were horrible. Unfortunately, I booked this hotel because of the reviews on this site. I would not stay at this hotel again. I will also never book a hotel by the ratings of this site. The people writing the rave reviews of this hotel must of been high."
210,1129,"Oct 20 2004	friendly efficient...good choice!	My daughter and i stayed here for 2 nites. i chose the hotel based upon trip advisor reviews. this hotel was a great value in a very expensive city. our room had adequate space, was efficently laid out, and had some nice extra touches (bathrobes, slippers). the staff was friendly, helpful, courteous. the location is good...walk easily to the tube and to paddington station. my daughter and i also stayed at a 5 star hotel in rome on the same trip. it was nothing but a hassle from the moment we checked in. the royal park was a much more pleasant experience!"
211,1129,"Oct 20 2004	A few problems	I booked a room with a queen four poster for my parents (a 49th wedding anniversary trip) based on the reviews here. While they are a bit hard to please, I was very disappointed to learn that they did not get the room I booked. The bathtub had a hump in the middle that made it difficult for my mother (5' 4&quot;) to stand upright. Worst of all, for most of their 12 day stay, their sleep was interrupted by people stomping around in the room above theirs (my father thought they had a card game going on). No accommodation was offered when they complained. My parents were not pleased with their stay and contemplated moving to another hotel. They elected to stay because they were too exhausted from touring each day to move."
212,1129,"Oct 13 2004	A really great stay	Just got back from three nights at the Royal Park. I'd stay again and recommend it highly. With the prices in London so high, this hotel was a very good value. We stayed at this hotel October 9-12, 04. I booked it based on reviews on this website and we were not disappointed. We've had mixed luck in London in the past and we we both breathed a big sigh when we entered our room. The room was beautifully appointed, just enough space. Everything was high quality and five star standards. Great beds, Frette sheets, soft robes, good fixtures, great TV, great lighting. The staff was charming. I ordered tea in the room in the afternoon and there was no charge. Very civilized. There are shops and restaurants close by, but the hotel is tucked just out of the busy area and with the extra soundproofing in the hotel, there is no noise. What's not to like? The location is so convenient, on the edge of Sussex gardens, a block from Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate Underground. We walked two short blocks to Paddington Station to pick up the Heathrow express on the way out. I look forward to going there again."
213,1129,"Oct 8 2004	Completely agree!!!	Completely agree with all the other rave reviews! Beautiful hotel, great location, excellent, friendly staff! Stayed for 3 nights in 3rd week of September. Their weekend package for an executive double room inclusive of continental breakfast was a good deal for a good-sized room with a king bed. We're only sorry we spent such long days sight-seeing that we missed the afternoon tea and evening champagne!"
214,1129,"Oct 5 2004	The one of the very best hotels I've stayed at in Europe.	We stayed at The Royal Park Hotel for 10 nights in September 2004. The hotel was really beautiful, full of antiques. Our room was a nice size and very romantic. At home we have a very expensive mattress and its hard to sleep in hotels. My husband and I slept like babies! They have really good mattresses and their bathrooms are really nice. The fixtures are top notch. The water pressure was great. The flat screen TV was a treat. The staff was incredible. Every time we walked through the door, they smiled and were soooooo nice. Daniel Turnbull, Jerry, Ronan, Adriana, Karen, and a gentleman who's name escapes me from Holland was wonderful. The housekeepers are all these cute girls from Lithowania (Spelling?) who are so sweet. The afternoon tea was really yummy and so was the scones. There is 24 hour room service also. Around the corner is Caffe Nero. Forget Starbucks. It's really bad in the UK. Caffe Nero is the best. Also, ladies 2 blocks away is a great accessories store called &quot;luleu or lelu&quot; it's across from Paddington station. Paddington train station and the tube is 2 blocks away, so is Lancaster Gate tube station... It is a great location to get around. I am a former inkeeper and would never stay anywhere else!"
215,1129,"Sep 18 2004	A Perfect Retreat	Spent three days in the second week of September, and found the Royal Park to be the perfect place to unwind after long days exploring London. While the rooms are smaller than usual by American standards, they are so perfectly appointed and maintained that I would bypass other four and five star hotels with larger rooms to stay here again. The rooms highlight the wonderful bed(s) and linens, and then surround them with antique furnishings that are both beautiful and functional. The staff was always gracious and helpful, and I found the hotel truly lived up to the rating it has here. I'm grateful to Trip Advisor for allowing me to discover this wonderful gem."
216,1129,"Sep 14 2004	Very Convenient for Business	Found a great rate on the Royal Park Hotel from Luxurylink.com and found it was easy to book. The hotel is only a few blocks from Paddington Station, which hosts the train from Heathrow (the absolute best way to get into London). That alone give the hotel a leg-up. It was further convenient to the Tubes for Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate. The only drawback was the room we had was rather small and the place is not super-equiped for business, but given the small size, it was easier to make sure faxes did not get lost."
217,1129,"Sep 9 2004	Wonderful place to stay	This is a wonderful hotel, very conveniently located, although a little hard to find at first since it is set back from the street. My husband emailed that we would arrive early, but we never expected a room to be ready at 8AM on a Sat.; yet they had one ready for us when we arrived. The room itself was very comfortable with a big bed and deep tub and very clean. Breakfast came with our package and was very filling. Staff there was incredibly helpful. Location is easy for everything, with two tube stations nearby. Nice neighborhood, too. I had a very early flight and was able to walk from the hotel to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express with no problem at 5 AM. Highly enjoyed my stay."
218,1129,"Sep 8 2004	It's all true!	My mother and I stayed here in the beginning of September 2004. Everyone else has said it all. This place is wonderful! We got a weekend rate of 135 pounds (+vat) including breakfast. All rates include afternoon tea and scones from 3-5 and evening champagne and canapes from 7-9 (either in your room or the drawing room). This is definitely a 5* hotel. The concierge actually showed us to our room (a twin-executive room on the fourth floor with windows overlooking a nearby street/houses). Everytime we walked into the lobby the staff would stop what they were doing to greet us. There is a continental breakfast option (it was included in our rate, but the price is 10 pounds) which included tea or coffee, fruit, cereal, yogurt, toast/croissants/pastries, and juice. It's the kind of thing where you hang your order outside your door the night before and they bring it to you at your specified time the next morning. The staff was ever so helpful for finding out show and restaurant information, and anything else we asked for. Evening turndown service is wonderful! The house keeping staff was even better. They would organize all our belongings we had left out every day (i.e. turn lotion bottle so that it faced forward on the counter). It was the tiny things that made the difference in this place. It is close to Paddington, we walked to the hotel from there with all our luggage (but I wouldn't suggest this!). Very close to Hyde park. Extremely safe area too!"
219,1129,"Aug 10 2004	Brilliant	We stayed here on August 2nd for 3 nights with our 4 year old daughter. Hotel was fabulous - Spotlessly clean, beautiful beds, robes and slippers for us all, flat screen t.v., complimentary champagne in the evening, tea and scones in the afternoon, newspaper in the morning, friendly and efficient staff.... need I go on!! definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. We will definitely return. A true gem in London."

1,1138,"super cool hotel	The Sanderson is one of the coolest hotels in London, great design / cool bar. A must go I would say...."
2,1138,"Amazing hotel	Beautiful place, like it's sister hotel at St Martin's Lane, very hip, trendy and noisy! Perfect if it's the sort of thing you're looking for, which we were. Lovely food as well."
3,1138,"Nov 22 2009 	Unique but a bit sterile.	This hotel had it's fun points: cool decor in lobby, good breakfast, hip style. However, some points that could be improved on:Evening noise from bar in lobby.Lack of privacy in bathroom.No walls in spa = noise from sitting room during massage. (Not cool.)Occasionally less than helpful staff at front desk. (Though mostly were fine.)I got this hotel as part of a charity auction. Paid a lot for it, but for a good cause. Wouldn't pay for this hotel rack rates - doesn't seem worth it. However, overall experience was satisfactory."
4,1138,"Nov 20 2009 	Quirky and fun but expensive	I recently stayed at the Sanderson with my best friend on their Suka package in a deluxe room. I'd heard about the Sanderson from friends and had been recommended to try it. On pulling up outside the hotel it looked like a converted 60's or 70's office building but on entering the lobby it was very quirky with a lot of interesting decor items that added a fun ambience. We arrived just after noon and I thought I'd try my luck to check in and luckily a room was available. The check in guy was very helpful and even gave us an upgrade to a room with a treadmill - not so useful when I was on a girls week-end and the last thing on my mind was workng out - but it came in handy for flinging clothes over!After check in we flew up to our room (via the fun space lift) to drop our bags off and I was pleased with first impressions upon entering the room - again quirky and fun styling! I loved the big sleigh bed on an angle and the weird egg shaped footstool? is it a footstool?We headed off to shop and did not get back to the hotel until very late afternoon. We grabbed a nap and then got ready for the evening ahead. For two lady friends sharing the room all the amenities were perfect and we were both able to get ready without getting in each other's way - plenty of room to move about in the actual room plus in the bathroom and wardrobe area.Once ready we headed down to the long bar which was already packed at 7.30pm on a Saturday night. We had to wait several minutes to be served and I was not able to open a tab that could be transferred to the Suka restaurant where we were eating that evening. So we had to close the bar tab, open a new one in the restaurant then close that when we had finished eating and open a new one to have an after dinner drink back at the long bar - something I can perhaps understand for non residents who might abscond but a pain in the b*tt for a resident. Suka is about 10 feet from the long bar!Dinner in the Suka restaurant was OK - nothing fabulous and not anywhere I would rush back to given the price. We asked the server's advise on how many dishes we should order for 2 people and were advised 6 - 3 for starter and 3 for main plus 2 sides. Having not eaten there before we did not know the portion size so we went with the advice we had been given - it turned out to be far too much and we could have got by with 4 dishes in total without any sides. We had to leave 3 dishes completely untouched - a waste when we're talking nearly 10 a dish! Flavour and presentation wise the food was good but not great - hence my comment about not rushing back. I've had better meals at local Asian cuisine restaurants.After our meal we headed back to the bar which by now was heaving. I waited about 10 minutes to be served and had to work very hard to catch someone's eye to order a drink even though they did not appear to be rushed off their feet.The bar had a great atmosphere - lots of 'beautiful people' but none with attitudes.In summary the stay was fun but expensive - the Suka credit against the room rate was a godsend given the price of the meal and the food we did not eat. The overall cost was justifiable if you are splitting it with a friend but I would struggle to hand over my credit card for one night with my husband when we would take the hit together.The hotel is interesting, quirky and I would recommend to friends if they have deep pockets."
5,1138,"Nov 14 2009 	Pleasant and Unique Hotel	This relatively small hotel is not what I would have chosen, as I typically enjoy brass and glass hotels. Nevertheless, I was quite impressed by the hotel. The staff is superb, the rooms are nothing short of immaculate, and contrary to some other comments, the hotel is rather quiet. Sheer curtains separated sections of my very large (even by American standards) room. Room service was promptly served. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families with kids, but it's great for couples and business travelers."
6,1138,"Nov 14 2009 	Appalling waste of time and money	I have signed up to Trip Advisor to warn you not to waste your time or money at this appalling establishment. An expensive mistake on my part to book a night away in London to celebrate a special occasion. The staff try there best however the poor, high handed management ruin their efforts. We had two experiences at the Suka restaurant which were bearable however room service was over prices and inedible. Unfortunately we were woken during the night by a fire alarm, there was complete lack of care and organisation for residents and the only member of staff that we saw during the experience stunk of a alcohol- thank goodness it seems it had only been a false alarm!"
7,1138,"Nov 9 2009 	best for cocktails not for accomodation	Great bar, not so great rooms-didnt eat there.We often go uptown from Kent to hit the better eating venues etc.We stay at the best hotels as it is our hobby.We have stayed at other hotels in this chain but found this room far too small and so noisey sleep was not possible"
8,1138,"Nov 7 2009 	The Price of Awkward Design	This was my second stay at the Sanderson. I had previously forgiven its hipster quirkiness since I love staying at cool &quot;design hotels&quot;. But this time...I found so many little annoyances, that it pretty much added up to one BIG feeling of frustration. I'm all for 'intentional imperfection&quot;, but the vanities and the artwork are askew enough to look like a mistake. I'm also a petite 5'2&quot; woman...and yet, I keep running into table corners, the glass partitions that are slightly too wide, and the bathroom doors that are slightly too narrow. I felt like Alice in Wonderland on a very mild acid trip. What's the point?If you are traveling for business, get ready to throw your computer out the window. The connection is so slow and craps out so often, that you're liable to lose all your work. (Which is why I've had to write this review 3 times!) I made several calls to the front desk, and just got the run-around and never got any help. I'm sorry, but in 2009, I have to dock any 5-star hotel for charging $15/day for wireless.The spa and the gym is lovely, however. For me, a spa freak, it is its saving grace. I was disappointed though that I have been denied my Eve Lom facial several times because they are always overbooked. So plan well in advance.Also, bring your own music and movies. I submitted a list of about 10 from their library, and got 3 of my least preferred back.Again, this is not a horrible hotel and it does have a trendy vibe. But by 5-star standards, it's a bit frustrating, especially when one compares to the impeccable service and attention in 5-stars in Asia. It reminds me a lot of the Soho Grand or Paramount in NY...where the hype keeps it alive.I would love this hotel to redeem itself to me!"
9,1138,"Nov 1 2009 	Exceeded My Expectations	I was somewhat apprehensive prior to arrival owing to the mixed reviews. However all aniexty was immediatly alleviated on arrival.My partner and I are both of Afro-Carribean descent and frequent many high end establishments whereby our presence, is often less then welcoming :-(This was the complete opposite with The Sanderson Staff. Infact they were extremely friendly and welcoming.The receptionist, was extremely patient and accomodating, as you are required to place a deposit (something i was not informed at the time of booking), we were able to pay cash, with the deposit paid with a debit card. We were not made to feel awkward. I believe the receptionist name name was Inja..(30/10 was the date , i am not sure if i remember her name correctly and its only fair that she receives due praise)Further we were upgraded to a Deluxe King (breakfast included) as it was my birthday. With which i was truly elated, I have never had anything like that happen to me before :=)Loved the lift and on entering room 404 i was suitably impressed. The huge sleigh bed, the super white, minimalist interior and the lcd large screen tv, where all immediately noticable.I must say the room was spotless, no dirt in sight, which is remarkable for an all white Decor.The bathroom i loved, its sexy and clean. Visible from the sleeping area if you use just the white curtain, but can be concealed with usage of both the pink and white curtain. Complimentary toilitries are provided, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. (make sure you bring toothbrush &amp; toothpaste, thankfully we did). A bathrobe and slippers are also provided with compliments for the duration of the stay.I would give the room/bathroom a 9/10.The shower needs a shelf and the enclosed toilet would be perfect if it automatically freshened on the toilet flushing), the light switches are so far away once in the bed and a remote of some sort which controlled the lighting,temp and curtains would be much appreciated.Tea and coffee making facilities are much needed also. We ordered room service for tea and coffee, but we would have much preferred to make our own.Aside from that, it was a Friday night, both the long bar and purple bar were popping (slang for full and lively..lol), yet our room was sooo quiet, no transferrance of noise which was fantastic.We dined out, partner wanted a steak, on return the doorman remembered us and us greeted with a smile. The atmosphere was cool, alot of well dressed young trendy types. No pretension noticed, but then i wouldn't notice that as i am appreciative of a young gorgeous trendy and well dressed scene.My boyfriend loved it, we hung out in the Billiard room, the fellow guests were also mostly very friendly.Having had a good night sleep, in that divine bed, nice firm mattress and the pillows were just right. I woke up alot earlier then my partner. I decided to check out the AGua spa...woooow is all i can say. Its all white, with silver furnishings etc. The receptionist was lovely and she lead me to the steam room and dressing area. Plenty of water with fresh lemon slices,ice, magazines,iced flannels near the steam room to ensure that you can suitably relax in the environment. Great for a morning after a big night out. Very cleansing and detoxifying.We went down to breakfast, it was busy and the staff again was faultless. Very attentive and ensured that that we had eveything we need. Breakfast is held in the Suka resturant, which alongside the rest of the hotel has a fab decor.Check out was effortless, i was actually owed money, the receptionist offered to keep our bags behind the desk, if he were going to do more shopping.All in all we had a fabulous stay, we live in London, but it really is an Urban Retreat with a very cool, contemporary, liberal vibe to it. So it really is possible to have a mini break in your own city. We will be returning, but for longer then one night and i plan to use the Agua spa for days when i just need to get away from it all,"
10,1138,"Oct 29 2009 	Signed up..Just for this	Wanted a weekend away in Semptember and as family members had stayed previously I thought I would book the Sanderson. Really pleased I did and having read, but never used, this website before I felt the need to sign-up to post this review. Fantastic hotel, it's &quot;a little different&quot; in a very positive way, cool, chic, superb location and I spent the following few days telling everyone how different and cool it was - especially the lifts! Really enjoyed the stay, reasonably priced and will certainly be back on the next visit to London. I have had no hesitation in recommending to friends. Great hotel."
11,1138,"Oct 17 2009 	.	A lavish &quot;Urban Spa&quot; in the heart of Londons West End, Sanderson offers a retreat from the bustle of the city into a world of fantasy and wellbeing. The landmarked 50s building has been transformed by Philippe Starck into a surreal Cocteau-like dream world, epitomizing a new luxury that is smart, pared down, and tempered with a healthy dose of wit and irony."
12,1138,"Oct 15 2009 	Potentially great but let down by service	The good side of the Sanderson:We had high hopes of a stay to remember when arriving at the Sanderson for a short spa break and an afternoon at the Agua Spa got us off to a promising start; the team were fantastic and had us both de-stressed in no time! The room was stylishly minimal and some miracle worker manages to keep all of those white walls free from the usual scuff marks that even the best hotels gather over time. For the evening we had a quick drink in the Purple Bar (intimate but friendly) followed by an amazing dinner at Suka - great food in a relaxed atmosphere.The bad side of Sanderson:Unfortunately first impressions last and the check-in experience at the Sanderson left a lot to be desired. Having arrived at 1pm our room wasn't available until 5pm but instead of the basic courtesy that you'd get at the lowliest of b&amp;b's, we were left with the distinct impression that our desire for a room was an unwelcome intrusion into their primary role as uber-cool style icons. Happily this aloof attitude did not extend beyond the front desk but it sets the scene and subsequently being pleasantly surprised by good service can't be a good sign!Overall we'll most definitely be going back to the spa and to Suka but we'll be sleeping at a different hotel when we do."
13,1138,"Oct 13 2009 	The Sanderson in London is Incredible.	From the incredibly stylish entrance, bar and cathedral with pool table to the chic and innovative choices and detail paid to the guest suites, the Sanderson in London by far is one of the most comfortable, convenient and hip properties I have encountered in my travels. The staff is friendly and dedicated to service - as I was stepping out of my black cab I was greeted by name, until my room was ready they took my luggage and sent me off to the spa on the 2nd floor. Room service within 20 minutes generally, and an in-suite bar selection you would expect from Morgans Group (Generous quantities of &quot;Top Shelf&quot; Liquors and Beers, Wines and aperitifs). My one tiny complaint is the Exclusive Hotel Guests Only Bar - &quot;Purple Bar&quot;, doesn't carry Jack Daniels, it's simply not fancy enough!While staying In London for 26 nights, it didn't take long for the Sanderson to become my home away from home. All I can say now is that I'm homesick for Sanderson!Bottom Line - It's a great destination that won't disappoint - Business &amp; Pleasure combined."
14,1138,"Oct 13 2009 	A certain idea of Perfection	It was my second stay at the Sanderson and this time everything was perfect from the beginning to the end (since my last stay, the rooms are maybe a little bit &quot;tired&quot; but the new LCD screens are definitely a great touch, the concept is still refreshing and all the Staff was absolutely perfect and friendly from the beginning to the end - except the concierge that did not allowed us to make pictures in the lobby). I usually come severall times in london (about a week each time, for leisue puposes) and I usually let an apartment in the middle of SOHO. Our last stay at sandersons was so nice that, maybe, next time we could plan to stay there (even though it would be a more expensive &quot;option&quot;).The concept of the hotel is still perfect and you really are as in an &quot;urban retreat&quot;. The contrast between the public area and the room is very refreshing and it is a real place to unwind. The turn down service with the candel lighten and all the room modified takes a great part in that sensation.The locastion is very convenient and quiet.Whe had the chance to be upgraded (as former clients of the hotel) and it was a great touch. Moreover, breakfast was included in our rate and it was absoulutely perfect. Do not hesitate to try it. The cold part was very luxurious (real fresh fruit, luxury jam, absolutely amazing pastries) and the hot part was completly fitted to our requirement (you can order everything what you want, even in term of cooking).This night at the Sanderson was the last night of our holidays and it was perfect and allow us to forget that it was the end !"
15,1138,"Oct 8 2009 	Amazing Experience - One of the Best Properties I've Ever Stayed	My time at the Sanderson was too short. From the moment I stepped foot in this property, I was treated like royalty, and that experience lasted until the moment I left.I booked one night at the Sanderson via the Morgans Hotel Group website, mainly because I am a huge fan of their other properties. I've always enjoyed the Mondrian in Los Angeles, and the Clift in San Francisco, and thought that since I would be in London, I would check out another. While the hotel rate could not be qualified as &quot;budget,&quot; it certainly was much less expensive that choices like the Four Seasons, Berkeley, or Mandarin Oriental. I had booked a standard room, and planned for a wonderful stay as a solo traveler.I arrived at the Sanderson on foot, after taking the tube to the Oxford Circus station. It is only a short walk from the station to the hotel (maybe 10 minutes total), and in a very populated shopping area (no chance of ever feeling like you are walking through a &quot;shady&quot; neighborhood at night). Upon walking into the hotel, I felt like I was in another world. The furniture was incredibly unique and fun, and while I would certainly consider the lobby &quot;minimalist,&quot; everything worked well together. Since I had arrived around 12:00pm, I was informed my room was not available yet (check-in time is at 3:00pm, as are most other properties in the world), and I was apologized to for the inconvenience. I gave the young lady my mobile number, checked my bags at the hotel, and went to do a little shopping. The employees of the Sanderson quickly learned my name, and upon returning to the hotel about an hour later to use the restroom, I was greeted by first name whenever I walked past someone I had already met.Around 1:30pm I received a phone call saying my room was ready. I went back to the check-in desk, and the same young lady apologized once again for me having to wait (no apology necessary in my mind, as I was 3 hours early for check-in anyway). She had informed me she upgraded me to a &quot;loft&quot; room, which was beyond words to describe. Another employee came out with my bags, introduced himself, and helped me to my room. The elevators are very unique in this hotel as they all include a sort of &quot;outer space&quot; vibe, but still maintain an antique London quality. My room was on the first floor, only a short walk from the elevator. The hallways, while dark, are very private and unique, and all room numbers are labeled in lights on the ground (a nice change from the typical number on the door).Upon entering my room, I was blown away. A HUGE bed in a sort of &quot;sleigh&quot; frame, hardwood floors, curtains instead of walls (all controlled by a button on the wall instead of having to pull the curtains around), and a gorgeous shower and bathtub for lounging in. Behind the bed was a very functional desk, and two nightstands included a complimentary bottle of water and a few fun facts about the hotel.I decided to inquire at the Agua Spa down the hall whether a massage appointment would be available, and was pleasantly surprised that I could schedule one within two hours. The cost was around 75GBP, which I considered very reasonable for a high-end property (I usually would not pay so much, but since this was a short vacation, I thought I'd splurge). I took advantage of the steam room, calming room, and the delicious flavored water before heading in for my massage. I will say, of all the massages I've had in my life, this had to be a favorite. It was not at all rushed, the masseuse was friendly and engaging, and knew exactly where to focus her attention. I certainly would return to this spa.After dinner, I decided to take advantage of the Purple Room and Longbar that the hotel offers. The Purple Room is a guests-only &quot;lounge&quot; where drinks are served. Your name is checked against a list of registered guests at the door, and a very dark, yet fun room awaits. There were only two other guests when I entered (the space is not huge, but is large enough to probably hold 40 or 50 guests), and a very friendly waitress recommended a nice beverage for me to try. As expected, the beverage was delicious, and while not cheap by any standards, I found it to be reasonably priced. Since I was a solo traveler, the waitress engaged in fun conversation, and I never felt like I was lonely in this space (the other guests that were in the Purple Room were couples, so not much of a chance to meet other solo travelers). I was informed the Purple Room is open to 3AM, which is a nice treat in case you are in the market for a late-night drink or snack.Afterwards, I decided to visit the Longbar, just to see the atmosphere. The Longbar is a ridiculously long (I'd guess 80 feet or so) bar with fun furniture and exciting music. It was crowded as can be for a Thursday night, but I was able to easily get one of the bartenders' attention and order a beverage. Like the Purple Room, I found the Longbar to be full of couples and business groups; I did not come across any other solo travelers. I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone looking to meet someone new, but I would just for fun conversation with others, or just for a fun atmosphere. There was also an outdoor lounge (covered under a huge canopy) which you could enjoy, as well as a restaurant in the hotel that I heard was delicious, though I did not try myself.Even as the night progressed, hotel employees addressed me by name and were always courteous, and I could not have been more pleased. I returned to my first floor room (I could not hear any music from my room, even though I could see the outdoor patio and the Longbar out my window), and did a little work. Everything in the room was very functional and easy to use, and the room was incredibly spacious.Check-out was just as simple a process, and while I did not take advantage of breakfast in the hotel or room service, I feel the food would have been delicious (based on what I had heard from other guests).The Sanderson truly is a gorgeous property with a fun, friendly, engaging staff, and a must-see for those visiting London looking for a high-end property without going overboard on price. My only comment was the difficulty in using the Wifi (it required going to the front desk and requesting a physical username/password from them), as I wish it would be as simple as logging on from the room and having it charged directly to me. Repeat guests had complained the rooms were in need of a renovation as the property is almost ten years old, though since this was my first stay, I found everything to look fresh and new, and was not the least bit tired of the design by the time I left.Highly recommended to all."
16,1138,"Oct 1 2009 	2nd Wedding Anniversary Stay	I booked into the Sanderson on one of their special packages called the Suka package - which gave me a double room and 100 credit in their Suka restaurant for 270 (excluding VAT) as a second wedding anniversary celebration.First impressions of the location - very close to oxford street - very well positioned but quiet enough to seem as though you were not near the bustle. The outside of the hotel looked like a shabby old tower block but once inside my opinions quickly changed - very cool lobby area and the lady on reception very helpful and professional. The room was not ready but she said she would call me when it was - which she did as promised. The room was very stylish - the lighting in the corridors get your eyes used to very dark spaces then as you enter the room BAM flooded with light and white style fittings. All added to the feeling.We ate in the restaurant - i wouldnt rush back there - very pricey for what you are getting not that we had an eye on the money but looking back the dishes were heavily overpriced for what they actually were. That said they were tasty enough. All said and done a nice evening meal and a couple of drinks in the long bar which was starting to liven up by the time we finished our meal. Didnt have breakfast there as i have this major thing about 25 per person for hotel breakfasts - the wife hates it and call me what you want but i just cant handle it!!!!!! So we went round the corner and had bacon rolls and croissants with tea and coffee, plus a nice morning stroll where we sampled the delights of the tramps morning bin scavenging for their breakfast. Sad to see.All in all a nice hotel experience but looking back i would have much rather stayed in a 100 hotel and spend 200 on a really good night out.Enjoy it once but not somewhere i dream of going back to!Hope this helps."
17,1138,"Sep 16 2009	So So So Cool!	Oh my god I'm so hip!There is no doubt about the pure Euro chicness and trendiness of this Morgan's Group property. If you like slick and happening this place is where you need to be; equipped with a couple bars, a purple pool table a lobby with very modern aesthetics and happening restaurant this place goes the distance.The room was a curtain lovers dream for where walls and doors might traditionally be there are lights translucent curtains. The bed was very comfortable and the painting of the English country side above it was a humorous touch. The shower was of good pressure and the fixtures up to the moment. The wash basin mirror however was oddly placed, making shaving a bit more of a challenge than it ever has to be.We had breakfast through Room Service twice and it was rather standard. The important thing was it was on time, and hot.The concierge was professional though I wish they had steered us away from York &amp; Albany which the Hotel supports through their guest guide.The area where the hotel is located is pretty lively and within walking distance from many shops and some theater as well as an Underground stop.A couple side notes the bar does get loud and if you are roomed on the court yard you will hear the crowd and the music until about midnight; the gentleman who checked us in had informed us about this before hand so it wasn't a bother at all. We visited the Purple bar which is more of a small lounge to have a couple drinks in before we headed out to dinner. I ordered their Brooklyn (which is a Manhattan made with Sazerac) and while the beverage was very good I got a bit of a surprise when I ate the cherry; there was a pit inside! The bartender was more concerned with explaining how awesome he was because they use fresh cherries and prepare them in their own liquors and such and didn't really see the problem with a cherry where the pit is not expected to be. I hate to sound like a tool but I would have liked a warning.Anyway if you are going to stay at a Morgan's Group Hotel in London, the Sanderson is my pick over St. Martin's Lane."
18,1138,"Aug 29 2009 	Mixed Feelings	My initial apprehension as we approached the time of our stay at the Sanderson was heightened when we arrived at the entrance of the hotel directly from Heathrow after a 12 hour flight, and there was nothing to signify it was a hotel entrance, no porters nor doormen to welcome us or, at least, to help us with our luggage. It was 6.30pm. Finally, after struggling with our luggage and practically kicking the front door open, we were met with...nothing....but funky designer furniture pieces... and a smart-looking bar to our right and the front desk on our left.Determined not to be put off, this being the first holiday my husband and I have had together for a while, we approached the front desk. Perhaps my experience with Asian 5 star hotels has coloured my opinion but I've always felt that notwithstanding the decor of the hotel, how funky, cool or avant garde it may be, the friendliness/sincerity of the reception/front desk staff should be a priority. But this was not to be. We had an adequate reception. Enough said.Things started to look up when the young bellhop led us to the strangely incongruous lift darkened with scenes of space, the Final Frontier..., and apologised that he had not been there to help us with the luggage as he was assisting another batch of guests. His sincerity and warmth was a contrast to our initial reception.The room door opened directly into the bathroom and dressing area with a lovely freestanding bathtub to the left and glass-walled water closet &amp; shower cubicle at the end. A white sink bowl sat atop an orange venetian glass vanity and a mirror floated above slightly to the side suspended from the ceiling. Filmy white curtains formed the &quot;doors&quot; to the glass shelving and hanging space on the right with a fluorescent uplit floor (presumably so that your designer shoes would look very cool!). The bellhop carefully went through the ins and outs of the room, stressing gently that there was an opaque curtain behind the transparent curtain that served to block the bathroom from the bedroom for the purposes of modesty, since the walls in the bathroom were transparent too. These curtains worked at a touch of a conveniently placed buttons.Ample storage space was found behind white cupboards along the length of the wall of windows, and the expected amenities such as soaps, robes, hairdryer and umbrellas were artfully placed in frosted plastic boxes or directly on the glass shelving at the dressing area.However, despite promising he would return with an extra luggage rack for us, our bellhop was not seen again till we checked out 4 days later.The silver and white leather bed was positioned at an angle to the room and directly above it on the ceiling was a silver framed landscape painting. A grey pashmina was provided on the white duvet and the silver &amp; glass writing desk was set behind the bed's headboard. A white spanish shawl was draped over the white office chair, presumably for use. Silver bedside tables, another white chair, a silver chair with wings and a tall mirror made up most of the other extra furnishings - slightly eclectic but functional.Together with our upgrade came a treadmill (however, in our country, it is known as clothes horse) and the management thoughtfully provided us a bottle of mineral water, a bottle of wine and a daily newspaper. No slippers, though, but we survived. The adjustable airconditioning was a godsend as it was London, and there are good days and better days. If we had not needed to engage the services of the hotel staff, for instance, at check-in, the porter service at check out (they were reminded twice, and please note that the response of &quot;oops, I forgot&quot; is not an impressive one), and concierge services to leave a gift to be collected 2 days later which went MISSING until several visits and calls ensued, I'll have to say that I enjoyed my stay. The service was really nothing to write home about for a hotel that brags about its coolness. A cool hotel is one that manages to serve their guests as if it's the one thing on earth they were put there for. The staff here, with the exception of the porter, the doorman and a couple of housekeeping staff, seemed to feel that it was their job to act cool.All in all, a new experience for me, as I've never been stopped at the entrance of my hotel to be asked whether I was staying there although it all made sense when I remembered that it was a Friday night and that the Sanderson housed one of the &quot;cool-er&quot; bars in London, with all and sundry trying to get in. Bouncers as doormen, what a novel idea! The Purple Bar also a legend in its right as it admitted only hotel guests. We never tried the Malaysian restaurant called Suka, as we had just arrived from...Malaysia; so I'm sorry that I have no comments in that regard, nor did we sample any of the other outlets as we took full advantage of the fact that the hotel was less than a few minutes' walk from Oxford St, Regent St, Bond St etc. with all those wonderful side streets, nooks and crannies. (Eg The tall doorman on our first morning, kindly directed us to a sweet Italian coffeeshop round the corner.)I do think that it is time for a little bit of maintenance work to be done on the fittings and furnishings although I have no complaint but I can see why there have been comments regarding the room rate not being reflected in the upkeep of the hotel/rooms. If you enjoy the old world or traditional style of decor, this hotel is not for you."
19,1138,"Aug 25 2009 	Dont even think of dining at the Suka or having a business dinner!!	Hi,I am a city lawyer and brought a colleague to the Sanderson hotel, Suka restaurant, yesterday. I thought I should write and let you know my experience. The decor of the place is lovely but the experience ends there. The food was awful and so was the service. I had to get up from the table twice / three times to get someone to assist us - something you really do NOT want to be doing at a business dinner. I ordered my second champagne cocktail and it arrived after 45 minutes and only once I had finally walked into the restaurant (I was sitting outside) and called the waiter again. The food was below standards - the lamb was leathery and I'm not sure if teh waiter noticed but we left most of it. The duck tasted as if it was from a smoked duck packet and had just been put on the fire to grill and the roti chanai tasted as if it had been made ages ago and heated up in the microwave. The skewers of beef were cold. To call this malaysian food is an absolute apology and disgrace. I didn't want to complain at the time as I was there with a business colleague and we just finally wanted to get out. I even had to get up again from the table to get the bill!!When we got out of the hotel we asked for a black cab and were told that black cabs are very infrequent and were offered a mini cab which we refused (we were two girls and didnt want to take a mini cab). We finally walked to find a cab and were met by very unpleasant elements. I have been to Asia de Cuba and stayed at the Hudson in NY and both have been great experiences...I dont think I will ever want to bring a business colleague to the Sanderson again and certainly never for the food or the service! If this review can be passed on to the management that would be great - it might help the next unsuspecting person who goes there for a meal!!"
20,1138,"Jul 28 2009 	Outdated tired and noisy	This hotel was cool in 2002 but is way past its prime. The bathroom had water damage, there was a 1990's treadmill in our room, and the spa space lacks privacy. Overall, the decor is really tired and also not that well kept up.We stayed on a Saturday night and had a flight out the next morning. We discovered that the music from the Long Bar is really loud until 1:30 am. I'm not usually bothered by this kind of thing, but it was hilarious - it was so loud that the base was shaking the room, and we were on the 4th floor! We asked to be moved, but the only available rooms were on the courtyard, and all rooms on the courtyard were equally loud. It also has a &quot;quaint&quot; (aka outdated) film delivery service. There is a DVD player and you order films off a menu. Sounds fun, but when you look at the selection of films, it's not. There are so many other great places in London, you should skip this. Visit the Long Bar for a drink, but don't stay here."
21,1138,"Jul 23 2009 	overpriced	It's a great location and the whole thing looks very trendy in a Michael Douglas sort of way. So much so, we decided to stay a night. On first glance, the room was impressive, all white waftiness and clinical design. Sort of net curtains meets Damian Hirst. Anyway, there were two dots of blood on the sheet. We should have complained (did mention it on the feedback) but by the time we'd discovered this 'scene of the crime', we'd already unpacked. Couldn't get the TV to work so had to call room service, who did come fairly quickly. The air conditioning was raging all night and we couldn't turn it off. We didn't really like the toilet being IN the bedroom. It is seperated by a frosted glass wall but you can still see your partners silouette, which is not romantic. If you're at all suceptible to stage fright, when peeing in front of your partner, best stay elsewhere. So far, we were able to laugh all this off but the killer came the next morning when any remaining shred of romance was swiftly despatched. Soon after our breakfast was delivered, someone knocked on the door to say have you finished? Then 5 minutes later, when a man with a hostess trolley asked us if we'd like to buy any alcohol (at 10.30am), then they knocked again for our breakfast dishes. We felt like shouting, &quot;OK, we get the point, you want us to leave&quot;. We had two drinks each and the bill came to over 400. For this price, we'd have rather had a blood free, quiet room with a toilet that wasn't at the end of the bed. Call me old fashioned, I know."
22,1138,"Jun 28 2009 	Chic funky and central - you will love it here	I stayed here with my wife for a weekend. I was a bit unsure about whether this would be one of those overly fussy places where everyone wants a tip for everything and hangs around like a nasty whiff. Thankfully, there was none of that. It was like 'we're there if you need us'.The hotel is fantastic to look at when you walk in. Very trendy. The lift's are cool with a dark space theme and music playing. The staff are very nice. Professional and far more approachable than the stuffy types you can get at other upmarket hotels around the Park Lane area.The Suka restaurant is great. The food is sheer bliss. A word of note though, you'll need to bring your wallet for this. We thought it was a main meal sort of thing but it became apparent that each of the meals are 'tapas' style -and 3 dishes are recommended. In my view, if you need 3 of these dishes, you're either extremely hungry, or have issues with eating. The food itself is beautiful but each of these tapas range between about 12 up to a whopping 20-ish just for a single tapas style plate.If you get 3 dishes, you're looking at c. 45 - 60 just for your main course dish(es).The drinks are also very pricey. c. 10 for a glass of wine. 5 for a bottle of water. 4.50 for an OJ. Four of us ate (no dessert and two on soft drinks) and I was expecting the bill to come in at about 150. It came to about 300 which when two are drinking soft drinks, works out at quite a lot. Thankfully, the food was very good.Overall, this is a great hotel. Yes it's pricey but hey, you're staying at one of the nicest hotels in London that's unlke most hotels you'll ever stay in (in a positve way). You know what you're letting yourself in for. You will walk out of this hotel feeling like an A Lister, which let's face it, is why you'll be staying in this hotel in the first place. It'd be a bit like buying a Bentley and complaining that it drinks too much juice.Re the rooms, the funky theme continues. Nothing like any other hotel I've stayed in but that's a good thing. We had a superior room which was great. I don't know what the standard rooms are like but in realirt, they're probably a bit on the small side but 1, you only need the room for a sleep and 2, the rest of the hotel more than makes up for it. If you want to treat yourself, I would highly recommend this hotel. We would defintely return.Thank you to the staff for making it a lovely weekend."
23,1138,"Jun 11 2009 	all decor no substance	I won a night at this hotel and i was really excited after reading the reviews and looking at the info i received. i was booked into a delux double double according to the website it had swan chairs and city views and with the price i expected to be pampered lol. My first shock was breakfast wasnt included and at 25 per head i couldnt afford to get it myself on top of dinner etc. The biggest shock was the room. I was in 126 which certainly didnt have city views but a horrid view of air conditioning and the fire escape with people smoking on it looking into my room!!!!!! - so i had to keep the blinds closed to keep my privacy so the stark room took a more locked up feel. There were no swan chairs but a sofa which was very grubby and could do with a good deep clean aswell as the rugs. No one told us where anything was in the hotel so we had to look for ourselves, the reception and bars were lovely likewise with the terrace. I cant help feeling as they knew i had won the room i didnt get the service a paying guest would have got. I expected to be treated like a queen but felt more like someone staying in a jazzed up travel lodge. Perhaps if i had diner bed and breakfast there it would have been different story. As a cinderella i certainly didnt get to go to the ball which was a real shame as i could never afford to go to a hotel like this so i feel cheated"
24,1138,"May 23 2009 	Fantastic stay	Just come back from 1 night stay in Loft balcony suite and highly recommend this modern, chic hotel right in the middle of where you need to be in London. Fabulous room, great service from reception to bar staff and bellboy. Will return!!! Thank you."
25,1138,"May 22 2009 	tatty all style no substance	Very disapointing . Rooms where good looking but dirty.There were even specks of blood on the ladies lobby toliets.We cound,t check in to 15.00 and had to leave by 12.00 alot of money for not even 24hrs.Had two rooms which where booked last year but cound,t even get them on the same floor .For real service ,style and what a hotel of this calirber should be stay at The langhams"
26,1138,"May 13 2009 	i feel cool now	I liked staying here - There is a modern design triumph everywhere you look. The service was friendly and competent. The location is very central. I stayed in room 129 and there was wifi from a neighboring building, so i avoided paying the annoying 15 pound charge for internet - yay! One thing i didn't like was that the gym was positively arctic from the blasting air conditioner! My younger co-worker (24 yrs) was definitely more enchanted than me, and i suspect this place is a hit with twenty somethings."
27,1138,"May 9 2009 	Didn't quite meet expectations	We stayed here for one night, on recommendation from friends. The location was excellent for shopping, easy access to underground car park, etc. I don't know quite what we were expecting, but the room just felt a bit too stark. Would probably be ok for some people (white walls, picture on ceiling), but we just didn't feel comfortable. Having the bathroom behind a curtain and the toilet in a glass box was just too much for us! - ok for some I'm sure, but was just lost on us! We didn't try the food, but the bar was definately fun. We've stayed at The Soho Hotel a few times, and next time we're in London we will return, we just felt so much more comforftable there, and love all the little extra touches."
28,1138,"May 7 2009 	Tired tatty and overpriced	My partner and I spent one night at this hotel for a romantic anniversary break - and we really chose the wrong hotel. Although the photos on the web make it look funky and stylish, the bedrooms are simply former offices with a large bed in the middle. Yes the bed is very comfortable, and the bath and the shower are fine, but with thin, metal venetian blinds at the windows, only one painting - on the ceiling - and white net curtains seperating the sleeping area from the bathroom, there really is no romance.  For some reason there was an old, cheap, grey pashmina thrown on the bed - the only reason I knew this was part of the room and not something left behind by a previous guest, was because we had to change rooms as our first one had a horrible smell. There are no tea or coffee making facilities - so it's very expensive room service for a cup of tea. If you need to use the bathroom in the night, there is only one light switch which turns on all the lights, thus waking up your partner. And with no bedside light, you have to stumble in the dark to find that switch! Both the rooms and the hotel corridors looked tired and a bit tatty - maybe it is due for a refurbishmentThe chairs in the famous Purple Bar are the size 5 year olds sit on at school - not comfortable! Breakfast is great, but a long wait. The saving grace is the wonderful staff - really friendly and helpful."
29,1138,"May 5 2009 	Disappointing....	I was really looking forward to our visit to the Sanderson and although it doesn't rate very highly on trip advisor I assumed it was so 'out there' that it was too different for the average visitor. Yes, it has a very trendy bar which has a great vibe. Yes, the decor when you first arrive is quite stunning in that it is completely different to any hotel we've ever stayed in so that was quite refreshing. The room (deluxe king) was very minimalist and again quite refreshing in its simplicity. BUT it just doesn't quite hit the spot because the quality of the furnishings when you look closely is quite poor (the low lighting hides any imperfections!). For the price you pay for the room, you would expect face flannels wouldn't you?? And yes, they light a candle (tealight) for you on turndown. ... but that is it! I foolishly assumed that this quality of hotel would provide bottled water in the room. No - we were charged 10 for a bottle of water. And there are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room - no doubt hoping that you will go downstairs and have one at a cost of 4 ...... We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and don't mind paying for good service and surroundings but somehow I felt a bit cheated here. I really wanted to love it. I really really wanted to! But I came away feeling like they just wanted to get as much money out of us as possible! Mis-information about payment up front left a bit of a sour taste too..... On a more positive note, the hotel is located in a great position for central london and the concierge was great. Go to the Long Bar for a cocktail before a night out, but I would not stay at The Sanderson again - there are lots of other hotels where you are made to feel special and I didn't feel that here."
30,1138,"Apr 15 2009 	Good but not outstanding - a shame....	Interior design is great, typical Stark, the &quot;space lifts&quot; are super cool.Service ranged from a cool (verging on ice cold) reception welcome, to the bar manager dealing with a complaint extremely well.....Room rate isnt cheap (expected), but everything is charged extra, including 5.95 to have a shirt ironed, 3 room delivery charge for room service, gratuity added to everything (unfortunately normal for London nowadays), 20 charge for the hotel driver to take us to as restaurant etc..... A bit irritating, ive never had those charges at other similar hotels ive stayed in - to me, thats why you pay to stay in a 5 star hotel, to benefit from all the comforts, service and amenities. We booked a Deluxe room which was a bit disappointing for the price (quite often the case in Morgans Group hotels i find), so we complained and received an upgrade to the Loft, which was more comfortable.Overall, we did enjoy it, glad we tried it, although i wanted to love it, personally, its unlikely i would stay there again."
31,1138,"Apr 13 2009 	Trendy Chic Hotel!	I went to this hotel for my 23rd birthday and it was amazing!!When arrived we parked outside and i have to say dont be put of by the old office block look this hotel has because as soon as you get to the door WOW!!The reception is so out there with a swing and random chairs but it works. The desk were friendly and check in was very quick.Then we made our way to the lift which again is amazing ( i wont spoil it for anyone)!As everyone else has pointed out the rooms are all white......mini bar was great full of the normal stuff. The tv and music system had movie's and a music playlist which was great so if you forgot to bring your ipod to put in the docking station then we can choose pop for example and it would play songs from that style.The Long Bar downstairs was lovely and the bar staff were very helpful and didnt mind helping you with your drinks choice. Food was good there too just small bar snacks. Saturday night the bar gets very busy this is one of the coolest hang outs in London so be preared to spot the celeb and for it to get busy for 6pm onwards. Everything about this hote li loved and i will definately be returning!!! You have to like something a bit diffrent to understand this hotel so if your looking for traitional dont come here!! Overall 10/10 all round, if its good enough for Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom and Leona Lewis then what more can i say......."
32,1138,"Mar 18 2009 	Ultra hype hotel	Minimalist and trendy, the Sanderson is great for anyone who like this kind of hype hotel.Location: Berners street is only a few minutes walking from Oxford and Regent street. Perfect.Great minimalist lobby with original sofas and chairs.On the right the lobby bar, very much crowded on saturday night, but quite empty on sunday evening. Good music and ambiance.Breakfast was good with a lot of choice.The room was not huge, but with an incredible design: white curtains everywhere (even to separate the bathroom from the room), comfortable bed with a painting on the ceiling (never saw that before!).Service was good for what I've asked.The Sanderson is really a cool hotel, but if you like traditionnal luxury hotels, I understand that some people might not like this hotel.I will certainly return, even if the rates are quite expensive."
33,1138,"Mar 16 2009 	Beautiful Hotel Fantastic Location	Myself and my husband have just returned from another fantastic stay at the Sanderson Hotel. We stayed here back in 2001 shortly after it had opened and were extremely imnpressed with everything the hotel has to offer and were extremely pleased that absolutely nothing has changed over the years. The service is faultless, especially the conciege/doorman who were always polite and friendly (particularly one gentleman who welcomed us to the hotel on arrival and then helped us with a taxi 4 days later when we left and remembered exactly where we were returning too...impressive memory)!! The room was spotlessly clean and tidy with the same lovely touches (such as lit candles during the evening turn down service). The shower was amazing and the bed extremely comfortable)! Being fans of Phillipe Starcks work its great to walk through the reception area stopping to look at his pieces! Plus, the elevator is probably the funkiest I have ever seen!We will not hesitate to stay here again (especially as we have a gauranteed upgrade the next time we stay, as a thank you and apology for experiencing a group of disrespectful guests who decided to shout and scream down the corridor at a ridiculous time of the morning. The upgrade was not necessary, as it was not the hotels fault, but a very kind gesture none the less)."
34,1138,"Mar 14 2009 	Fantastic concierge and overall great hotel	Had a three nights stay at the Sanderson in August 2008. The hotel is very conveniently located near Oxford Street and the Theatre District. Liked the design and loved the breakfast (although its quite expensive if you dont have it included in the room rate), but the best part was probably the excellent concierge service. Highly recommended, would not hesitate to return."
35,1138,"Mar 1 2009 	I would NEVER stay here again or recommend the Sanderson!	I booked the Sanderson as a suprise for my partner as it was his birthday, so I over indulged and booked the romance package which set me back over 800 for 2 nights so I expected damn good service for the money! Concierge was fantastic, managed to organise a cake for me beforehand which was ready for us on the night I requested. Reception did not even offer to help me with my luggage to my room, again which was dissapointing.. and then onto the worse bits...our room, I found a used shaving kit in the drawer (and it was covered in hair!!) which disgusted me and then there were holes in our bed sheets.. and the real icing on the cake was that someone came into our room, not once .. but TWICE when we were in the bath!!!! I spoke to the front desk downstairs who assured me they would investigate and let me know what had happened, later that day I received a call from the duty manager who explained that the porter had come into our room by mistake and he should have gone into the room next door as he was bringing up luggage for some guests. In return for the inconvience he offered us a free soft drink at the bar which I found insulting! I complained to the sanderson after my departure and they have since offered me another nights stay, which is the least they could do.. let's just hope my next stay is better than the first!"
36,1138,"Mar 1 2009 	Great service rooms a little tired	Yep it's achingly hip and the staff are what you'd expect from a top notch hotel - friendly and well-informed. What lets it down is the standard of the rooms - the bed linen and towels felt like they'd been washed to a sandpaper consistency, and no amount of silky white curtains can disguise the fact that it's clearly a converted office block. This hotel needs a revamp to really justify the prices they charge. There are better options in this price bracket elsewhere."
37,1138,"Jan 23 2009 	bragging rights ahoy	Stayed at a suite here. Very modern, lots of glass and minimalist lines used. Floor to ceiling windows, welcome bouquets and evening munchies. Yada, yada.When we were coming in late one evening, there were tons of hoochies at the front door, trying to get into the hotel bar. The doorman sees us and immediately parts the crowd. Sweet!Yes, I supposed it's all for the bragging rights. I've certainly stayed at much better hotels, but this is just for the London experience of it all."
38,1138,"Jan 17 2009 	style over substance	Voted the hippest hotel in the UK in 2008, I was quietly excited about the visit and gently disappointed with the experience. The hotel is nothing to look at from the outside, but has great interior design, and a buzzing atmosphere. The rooms were very different from the normal corporate hotel, but comfortable, well thought-out and with some nice touches. The bars, restaurant and lounge area were all great fun to sit, watch and be seen in. What a shame therefore for it all to be let down by the shallow, dis-interested and borderline incompetent staff. From the over-aggressive security staff at the entrance, to the vain and vacuous reception staff, who were more interested in how trendy they looked rather than providing a 5 star service, they were awful. The only diamonds amongst the rubbish were the Purple Bar staff, who were discrete and professional at all times."
39,1138,"Jan 4 2009 	Loved the Sanderson	Chic hotel right in the heart of Soho. Very modern and trendy, and the staff was pleasant and helpful. I had a standard double room which was spacious and tastefully decorated. Loved the super comfy bed and sleek bathroom (especially the Korres toiletries). Room service was tasty though slightly pricey. There are two cool bars on the main floor; I especially liked the funky Purple Bar with its endless list of yummy martinis. Location cannot be beat... I much prefer the Sanderson to its sister hotel, St. Martin's Lane; happier with my room and definitely the service at the Sanderson.My only complaint is the paper-thin walls. I could hear nearly everything going on in the room next to me at all times..."
40,1138,"Nov 12 2008 	Satisfaction Guaranteed	Very centrally location, great service, good interior and food."
41,1138,Nov 7 2008 	great spot and location	i stayed in the sanderson hotel in november and it lived up toits expectations. we were looking forward to a few days break in london and wanted a hotel that was central and that lived up to its expectations. the sanderson did exactly this. oxford circus tube is only 5mins walk away and leicester square is a 5-10 min walk so location couldnt be better. rooms are well finished and funky with a cool and calm design. staff were very friendly and helpful and were available anytime they were needed. beware the cost of room servise. 24 for 2cups of coffee and 2 scones. def recommend this hotel though and id stay here again for sure
42,1138,"Oct 9 2008 	blast off to your room in this funky make over	The Sanderson offers a very interesting makeover of a 1960's hotel, with elements of Hotel W and an attempt to be ultra cool. The lobby is enormous and features the most out-there furniture which was a bit confronting for a business traveller, but wait! there is more. Enter the lift and you are blasting off into space in your tin can with the milky way around you. Landing on your floor you are plunged in a cavernous darkness only illuminated by room numbers on the floor at the foot of your door. (I can only imagine stumbling around in the dark if pissed). The rooms are quite large, white and lofty with wispy electric curtains separating the washroom from the bedroom. All in all very spacious and light for London with large windows and did I mention natural light. A great alternative if you can stomach the experience of getting to your room and want to be close to Oxford Street."
43,1138,"Sep 16 2008 	Over priced and over rated	I spent one night in this hotel on business recently. It is all very fine to look at and thinks highly of itself, as do most of the bar patrons, but it's really not worth the money.Check in was fine, staff friendly. The room is very minimalist. While I admire minimalism to look at I prefer a some comfort in my hotel rooms. The beds were fine, the covers too lightweight. At the desk there is a reading lamp which is plugged into the only socket in the vicinity so to work on my computer which needed to be charged I had to plug out the lamp and work without adequate light. In the bathroom there is a lot of glass which is again nice to look at but slightly disconcerting, I had to always double check my route out in case I was about to walk straight into another glass wall. The sink leaked onto the floor and the shower attachment on the bath did not work.The food in the restaurant downstairs was excellent. It is Asian in style and they suggest you order 2 to 3 plates per person - I suggest 2 at most as the portions are quite big. I thought the food bill was actually very good value.I cannot give an accurate review of breakfast as it took so long to come that I gulped half of it down before rushing off. There was a very nice buffet of cereal and fruit and the cooked breakfast had to be ordered. When placing my order I explained I needed to leave in 20 minutes to get to the airport and asked would my order be ready before that, I was told it would. Over 20 minutes later, and having had to ask for it again, it arrived.I wouldn't return. There was nothing awful about it but The Soho Hotel down the road which is a similar price offers much better value."
44,1138,"Sep 12 2008 	Loved the Sanderson	Just got back from a wonderful stay at the Sanderson. What an amazing hotel - The rooms with all the white fluffy curtains, and the hotel staff helpful &amp; polite. The spa was wonderful and relaxing. The atmosphere was attractive and the staff attentive. I would definitely recommend it"
45,1138,"Sep 7 2008 	Sexy and Chic	Fab hotel, beautifully designed and furnished. Our room was exquisite, modern with great attention to detail full of great products. Two bars, one for public access and one just for guests serving great cocktails. Fashionable London crowd and used by lots of agencies for shoots and putting up models etc. Full of beautiful people.Staff very attentive.Location very central for restaurants and shops etc in the West End just off Oxford Street.Looking forward to going back!"
46,1138,"Aug 25 2008 	The perfect chill out...	We booked the hotel through the website and had problems with our booking. They were very good, Ama in particular as absolutely brilliant. She made every effort to accomodate us and went above and beyond the call of duty!We looked on the website and saw some of the special offers - well worth doing! We found a 'Suka Package' which gives you the room and 100 credit for use in the Suka restaurant.Upon arrival to the hotel, the room was ready 3 hours before we were scheduled to be in it! We arrived at 12pm and our room shouldnt have been ready until 3, but they gave us the key straight away so we made our way up. The lifts are awesome but you really need to experience these for yourselves so I wont ruin it for you - but they are out of this world!Making our way down the corridor, they are fairly dimly lit but it gives a relaxing atmosphere. We stayed in room 122 which was apparently a Loft King. All we could say was 'wow'. From the super king size sleigh bed in the middle of the room to the bathroom separated by flowing white and pink curtains. The facilities themselves appear very nice, the bath for example is big enough even for me (6'5'', stocky chap!), but the shower connector in the bath fell off and the main shower looked like it may fly off at you whilst you are in it! However, these are only very small issues and dont let this distract you from the hotel. You really do feel a world away. The rooms are very, very relaxing indeed. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in, with pillows you can just sink into and a quilt to match. The blinds also block out all light, we woke up at 8:30am and you would have thought it was 2am it was so dark! The room was immaculately clean, but be careful when in the bathroom as some of the toiletries are there for your use but you may be charged A LOT of money. A sponge, for example, was 14 and a plain white t-shirt was 25.The staff are very attentive, however, there was some confusion caused with the type of package we booked and we felt we had to explain ourselves to every person. Instead of having dinner at Suka, we used the 100 credit for a couple of cocktails and also for breakfast the following day. If the cocktails are a 'must try' then breakfast is even higher on the list. I had a full english which was amazing. It doesnt look like a huge breakfast but it is certainly filling. My fiance had eggs benedict which she pretty much inhaled within seconds! It really was fantastic. If dinner is as good as breakfast then you wont be disapointed.We also had drinks in The Purple Bar - definitely try the 'Divine Chocolate' cocktails. AMAZING. Very romantic, intimate space which is great for relaxing in after a night out.Overall, we had a very relaxing couple of days and if we could live there we would! It is in a fantastic location for shopping (literally 30 seconds off Oxford Street) and is within 5 minutes walk of 3 good tube stations. The staff are friendly, attentive and make you feel extremely welcome and we are already thinking about our next visit."
47,1138,"Jul 23 2008	Fantastic funky hotel!	Came to stay at this hotel for the weekend with my husband, my sister and my parents, to have a good time in London.When we walked through the entrance, there is an instant wow factor! Everything is so trendy and funky!Although we were early, we were immediatley allocated our rooms and our luggage was bought up to us by a Porter.The rooms were fabulous - everything was so minimalistic and modern! The bed was in the middle of the room and had pillows at either end so you could sleep either end! The sheer curtains separate the room from the bathroom and create a sultry look. For more privacy, you just hit the elctric button on the wall and an extra pale pink curtain appears which is not so see through!I thought the photos on this website made the rooms look small so was a bit worried. But was suprised to see thatthey are actually bigger than what they look like in the photos.Before going out ot dinner in the evening, we went for a dirnk in the famous long bar in the hotel. Very glam, busy and lots of people! Had an extensive coctail list which we got stuck into! But of course very pricey!When returning back from dinner, around 12:30am, we were going to go for a night cap at the Long bar but could not believe how busy it was! Y ou could not ever get to the bar! Eveyone was drubk happy, chatty, music, etc. So we decided to go to the bar right by the reception, much smaller, quieter and romantic. So we all sat down and ended up sitting there for a few hours getting quite drunk! The staff were very attentive and the drinks kept coming! But be wary of the price. There were fiuve of us sitting there for around two hours and the bar bill came to 270, although there were a few cocktails included in this.The beds are soooooo comfortable! And the best things about the rooms for me were the blinds. They completely shut out all light! I can never lay in, the light always wakes me up! But when I woke in the morning, in pitch black and glanced at the clock, I could not believe it was 10am! I want these blinds!The hotel staff were great. There was an incident when I thought I had left one of my shopping bags in the lift. I called down and spoke to the reception and there was a security man knocking on my door in less than a minute! Turned out that I was just being stupid and had not left the back in the lift at all!Overall, had a fantastic time.Is completely different from any other hotel that I have stayed in. I Dont think this would suit an older coouple looking for a romantic break though, as it is so trendy and modern. My parents really enjoyed it, tehy are in their early 5o's but very modenr. But they said if they were going away on their own, they would have chosen a different hotel.Would be a great hotel for a romantic weekend for a young couple or even for a girly weekend."
48,1138,"Jul 15 2008 	Cool but at a Price by The Peke	The Boyfriend and I had two nights at the Sanderson as part of our holiday this year. We like to 'do' London from time to time. I had stayed at the Sanderson before, but as a prize through my company, so it was interesting to assess it when I was actually paying for it.Be aware that you will only get a discount on your parking if they park your car for you. We wernt informed of this so they relented and gave us reduced parking (still 85 for 2 days!). Not even sure if that was the discounted rate. Ho Hum.The lobby is impressive, modern and cool. I was put in the bauble thing hanging from the ceiling and left spinning around much to The Boyfriends amusement! Was fun sitting on a pair of lips waiting for a taxi. The staff were welcoming, helpful and personable, even when part of my luggage was a Tescos carrier bag (dont ask - we all need emergency chocolate!). The rooms are clean, modern and I happen to like the floaty curtain thingy ying yang effect. Pressing the buttons kept The Boyfriend amused for a while (he's a boy and a lovely man what more can I say!?). However, not much privacy when you are in the loo unless you turn the TV up!! THE BED IS THE BEST and I didnt want to get out of it - huge, comfortable with lovely pillows and linen.The concierge was helpful, managed to get us a table at the Gaucho Grill at the time we wanted in preference to our own attempts to book in (odd as they were half empty anyway but thats another story!). If you want theatre tickets, make the effort to walk to the theatre yourself - you will save 30 per ticket (in other words 60 for us for the sake of a ten minute walk) rather than pay the agents pemium.The down side is the price. Is it worth the 300 + per night standard rate? Even at 266 per night that we paid via lastminute.com it seemed steep for room only (went to Harvey Nicks instead for brekkie!). The crowning moment was the price for one champagne cocktail and vodka and orange at the bar - 23 AND they charged us over 2 quid for the privlige of serving it to us!! The Boyfriend is still in therapy!Also, I was shouted at by a barman for standing the wrong side of the rope thingy. Not very respectful way to treat a paying guest methinks. As for the people in the bar - well it was more middle aged businessmen looking for a bit of young totty to throw wads of cash at - but each to their own.The room we had overlooked the central bar/restaurant area and was noisy up until closing time but thereafter was fine. I admit I do like the Sanderson - it feels cool and I like the quirky way it is done. However, worth the inflated costs? Only you can decide?!"
49,1138,May 30 2008 	give this one a pass	It is all lipstick and rouge.....not really worth a 5 star rating. The finishings look amazing on the website but up close are not well done....hence all the subdued lighting in the halls and elevators. Rooms are very small for and the quality is not there for the price. There are far better hotels in london. would never stay there again.
50,1138,"Apr 29 2008 	I liked it not a lot but I did like it	Much hype about the Sanderson, a 50's building transformed by Philippe Starck. It definitely a cool hotel. As always in London it's hideously expensive - wether it's value for money is gonna depend on you. We had a deluxe King Room. Large bed but very hard and very uncomfortable. Great Linen as you would expect. Pretty rubbish tv channels but who is there to watch the telly anyhow. Oh yes, and lovely huge bath tub. Cool bars, extremely yummy breakfast in bed, fantastic mojitos, but at that price it's no more than you would expect. My one disappointment, not being able to get a cup of tea and a slice of chocolate cake in my room at 2am. It's what I needed after a night out but apparently there was no cake in the kitchen! Big let down.I liked it, not sure I'd go again though. There's nicer places in London for this price."
51,1138,"Apr 17 2008	Best for fun	The Sanderson is the best for a night time with a girlfriend or romantic weekend with boyfriend. But in general the best things about the sanderson you can experience even if you do not stay there...the bar, the terrace, the food (not amazing but interesting) and the spa. It is definitely worth using but not sleeping in it!!"
52,1138,"Apr 3 2008 	A wonderful stay	Have just got back from a brief and wonderful stay. This is such a fantastic hotel - it looks amazing, particularly the rooms with all the white floaty curtains, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Also had some spa treatments - and again a wonderful relaxing atmosphere and very attentive and capable staff. I would definitely recommend it - can't wait to go back."
53,1138,"Mar 6 2008 	Not Impressed	My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson Hotel in October of 2007. We were interested in staying at the hotel due to the design aspects as shown on the internet. The staff at the hotel were very unprofessional which was pretty sad, since the hotel itself was not that great. I will say that the location was good for us and China Town is a not too far away. Also, we were in walking distance of several theaters and restaurants. The food at the Sanderson's restaurant was not good, especially for the price! There are several good moderately priced Indian restaurants and pubs which would make a much better choice if you don't want to be disapointed.The hallways are extremely dark and are very lightly lit. The room itself was not bad, however the furniture inside was made very cheaply and it showed. You could also hear the people in the room above us. The hotel lobby music was extremely loud, if turned down a notch it would have been fine.The wireless internet service was out and I was charged for it anyway! I had to have them remove this from the bill, even though it was a known fact that it was down! And there was no other way of getting internet access to your room!The concierge at the hotel was more interested in talking with other staff and gossiping instead of helping paying hotel guests, and acted like it was a huge burden to ask him for information as to where a good Indian restaurant was.The Sanderson would be a great hotel if the service and food were better. It also seems to be one of the places to &quot;Be Seen&quot; and if I were younger and in my twenties I probably would have enjoyed the &quot;Vibe&quot; more."
54,1138,"Mar 5 2008 	A Spaceship	Stayed at the Sanderson in September '05 for the weekend before attending business meetings in Paris. My company at the time had a preferred rate at the Sanderson. Hotel: Very trendy lobby, the ultra chic staff is very nice and quickly checked us in and delivered our bags.Room: the layout is a bit odd, clear glass and sheer curtains, luckily I had my own room because there is no privacy.Bathroom: When I entered the room I asked my chic bellman &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; and he answered: &quot;You are standing in it.&quot; hmmm OKShower: I nearly flooded the &quot;bathroom&quot; after taking a quick shower - see photos of the shower set up.Food: breakfast is insanely expensive, did not even bother.Beds: Very comfortable but not &quot;cozy&quot;. Elevators/Hallways: very very dark with music constantly pumping at all hours."
55,1138,"Feb 9 2008 	Sisters Fav Hotel!	I booked this Hotel as a surprise Christmas present for my sister (we also went to see Cirque Du Solieil at the RAH). If you like contemporary and to be in with the &quot;it&quot; crowd then this is for you. I thought we were checking into an office block when we first arrived as the outside is nothing special although the doormen are very handsome! Check in was amazingly quick and straightforward. The lobby is quite strange - not quite sure what the theme is and whether sitting on a seat resembling a large pair of lips is comfortable - but!. As everyone says the lifts are amazing. Take the steps at the first floor to see the amazing stained glass window as you drift down to reception. Although it was February we took a look at the outside space which I can imagine is lovely in the summer. The 'long bar' is just that and at night was filled to capacity with &quot;beautiful&quot; people who I think come to be seen. We went in to the Purple Bar which is for residents only. It is quite tiny considering how many rooms there are in the hotel. You can only get in here if you show your hotel card which is taken off you!! - and for some reason there are tiny chairs in here only 1 foot off the ground!!!. Masses of Vodka cocktails ranging from about 12 and the &quot;baristas&quot; were making loads of complicated cocktails!!The room - fantastically huge as I had booked a twin room, the beds were almost double and extremely comfortable. The air conditioning did keep us awake so we turned it off. Bathroom is OK and the &quot;pink&quot; curtain you can draw electronically gives enough privacy. Toilet is separated by glass (frosted) and the shower once I had turned it on and drowned myself was lovely. Be wary of the expensive goods in the bathroom - easily recogonised as to 'pay for' as they are all wrapped up. Used the hairdrier which was fab- not one of these tiny things you get in most hotel rooms but a proper drier. The inclusion of bathrobes and umbrellas (in case it rains outside!!) a nice touch. I agree with the comments of one of the other writers in that the TV/'expensive' mini bar housed in what resembled a formica cabinet from B &amp; Q was ugly and outdated - not atall in keeping with the lushness of the rest of the surroundings - not quite sure I get the non-entity picture on the ceiling either!!!I would say that the Hotel is ideally situated if you want to shop - we walked to Oxford Cicus without any problem. Taxis to Harrods (packed on a Sunday!!) from the hotel cost about 13 and to RAH another 13.Breakfast is lovely - loads of choice although I consider it expensive if not booked as part of your package.My sister loves this Hotel (and its sister St Martins Lane near to Covent Garden) - me, not quite sure if I would stay again, 358 for one night is as others say rather overpriced!"
56,1138,Jan 23 2008	Awesome!	Great Hotel in a fantastic location!!Staff were very friendly from reception to bar staff.Walked to all bars &amp; shops in soho.
57,1138,"Dec 31 2007 	Worst two night's sleep of our lives	We have just returned from a two night stay at Sanderson and are very sleepy. The air conditioning system in our Deluxe King room was fairly noisy but it was severe dehydration that woke us every half-hour, and the 8 per bottle mineral water from the mini-bar didn't do much to quench our thirsts.Sleep-deprived on night two, we thought we were probably just unlucky when our neighbouring guests decided to hold a &quot;party&quot; well into the early hours of Sunday morning. That said, it could be that they had no choice but to make their own entertainment... the DVDs are (in our opinion, a vulgar attempt to squeeze more money out of their guests) 11 per night.Though the Sanderson interior is very pretty to look at (and the lifts are wonderful!), it is incredibly over-priced for what is quite simply a big West-End tourist-hotel. Both you, and your wallet, would be better off opting for one of the many smaller boutique hotels in the City..."
58,1138,"Dec 29 2007 	Out Of This World!!!	The hotel is definaltly a place everyone has to stay at , at least once.. its one of those hotels you either love or hate!! i personally loved it , it was very modern and funky. everything looked brand new, fresh and as if it had never been touched!The lobby was large and had unsual furniture, the staff were all very friendly and down to earth , not even stuck up as you would expect from some 5star hotels. Our room was on the 2nd floor , we could hear the noise frm the long bar frm our room but onli very slightly .. it didnt ruin our stay at all. The rooms are modern, simple, plain but also very unusal. We had a superior room im not sure how much different the standard is to the superior. Everything in the room looked brand new , all except the TV which i think you should be upgraded to a flat screen as you would expect it too seeing as its a 5star hotel thats whole focus is space saving and making a airey , relaxing environment, so the chunky TV spoils this slightly. The lift isss AMAZINGG!! i will say no more - you will have to see for urself as i do not wnt to spoil it for u! We had breakfast included with the room - the price of the contintental + english breakfast was 22.50pp - A lot of money!! but if its your stay at the hotel is a one off and a treat then you may aswelll treat urself to the breakfast. It was very nicee and everything you would expect, the resturant itself was very attractive and had a nice view of the garden.Overall A great hotel!! Only Cons was the extra costs they charge you that are very expensive!! i worried at everything i picked up and used in the bedroom as i didnt know what was complimentary and what we had to pay extra for. The Wireless internet is at an extra cost of 15 a day. Their are large bottles of shampoo etc. in a box in the bathroom that you can also purchase along with the very tempingg over=priced food and drink in the minibar. Their is a Sainsburys not far from the hotel so just stock up on ur food and drink their if need be as it is a lot cheaper!!Also... the mercedes taxis tht are outside the hotel are extremely overpriced also.. they wanted 15 for a 5min trip. we got a black cab instead and it costed 5. So be careful!!! They will charge you anything because they think that you will pay it as you are staying at a upmarket hotel!! Hope this has been some help to you. Have a nice stay at the hotel if you do go."
59,1138,"Dec 20 2007 	A great place to party but not necessarily for business	$700 a night doesn't buy much these days in London, especially at this hotel. Pack accordingly and prepare yourself to do battle with the oh so stylish but impracticalities at this place such as 1) a flashlight so you can see in the dimly lit hallways that were cool in the 90s but we're over it now; 2) a book reading light, otherwise you have to haul yourself out of bed to turn off the light when reading in bed; 3) an electric kettle - inconceivalble that a place that charges this much doesn't offer them. It cost me $43 to have one delivered to the room and came with one tea cup, 4 tea bags and a sugar bowl - not even a cookie. Fortnum &amp; Mason here I come!; 4) an extension cord so you can plug your gear into sockets located at floor level and not have to use your computer while sitting on the floor, nor dry your hair in the same position; 5) a small hammer so you can fully depress the button to flush the toilet, and a nail repair kit so you can fix the nails you broke trying to depress the oh so stylish button without the hammer; 6) determination to get past the doormen at night who ask for your name on a list to go into the lobby - or just grease them with a 20 pound note - this is what those who weren't on the list appeared to be doing during my visit; 7) slippers as those marble floors in the bathroom are very cold in winter; 8) willingness to be an exhibitionist while you are in the room as the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom give you a great view of the neighbors both day and night, and vice versa, as well as a traveling companion (let's hope you are very, very close) while you use the shower and the loo in full view ; 9) a luggage rack, or just don't bring much with you as the suitcase will end up on the floor taking up the path that goes around the free-floating bed in the middle of the room; 10) a rubber door stopper to keep the maids from barging in - those Do Not Disturb signs don't show up well in the very dark hallways. Thankfully the hotel provides ok toiletries and lots of plush towels to mop up the water that oozes out onto the oh so stylish flush-with-the-floor glass-walled shower. Call ahead for a showercap to be placed in the many shower-only rooms - who would think that someone might need one and they could be placed in the rooms automatically.Restaurant service is brusque with the black-clad waitresses constantly interrupting and one told us to cash out in the midst of a meal as she was leaving her shift and needed to get paid! On the positive side, the hotel is very well located on a fairly quiet street, the concierges were very helpful regarding restaurant suggestions and the day shift door men adept at giving directions and finding taxis.Great place for a wild weekend with a hot date, but not very practical for business travelers or those who expect the basics to be covered. If you go to mingle with the trendy crowd, Increase the odds that you and your paramour will get into the bar at night - check in on a weekday!"
60,1138,"Dec 2 2007	Nice Hotel	I have stayed here once before for business. Last time I found it a little too funky, appropriate for people younger than me. But my usual hotels in London were booked up, so ended up staying here again. This time, I was more comfortable. The glass wall around the bathrom did not bother me. Actually, I liked the firmness of the bed. The services such as the laundry valet, front desk, etc was good. The concierge, however, seemed a little less knowledgeable than usual for this class hotel. There is a popular bar in the lobby and the restaurant is extremely expensive. But I liked the hotel. Decent value for money."
61,1138,"Nov 6 2007	Great place to take a girl	This was one of the best places that I have ever taken a girl - it was awesome - they have white draped curtains and a bed that is huge! And - it is right in the middle of London, with great access to Oxford Street and the Theatre DIstrict. I stringly recommend this place."
62,1138,"Oct 26 2007 	Awesome Hotel cant wait to go back!!	This hotel is awesome, please please stay if you get the chance, you wont be dissapointed!!!"
63,1138,Oct 23 2007 	Multiple visits like it	Good hotel with lots of amusing design quirks. Decent restaurant with nice courtyard .I have stayed there on a number of occasions and enjoyed it.Love the elevator.
64,1138,"Oct 18 2007 	Great Lifts - Great Spa	Had a great stay here . Full of quirky furnishings .The outside space is lovely you don t feel like youre in the middle of london .Lovely cocktails not cheap though.The spa experience was fab I felt like I was in heaven ,vast expances of white voile .I was shown to a beautiful lounger complete with personal telly.Being in the lifts was like being in space surrounded by the galaxy.Service great only downside room was not overly large but glass walls between the bedroom and the bathroom was slick.Would go back again ,Get yourself a deal by searching the internet. im"
65,1138,"Sep 30 2007	Too cool for school!!!!	No two ways about it, this is a seriously cool hotel. OK, so it's not exactly cheap but if you are looking for something special this is it.The entrance lobby is fantastic with loads of weird chairs and sofas to relax on. There are two bars leading off from the lobby. The first (The Purple Bar) opens in the evening only and is small and very intimate. They serve a huge range of martinis.The second (The Long Bar) is open all day and worth checking out. Not cheap (2 cocktails cost me 30 pounds!).The room was minimalist but beautifully presented. Only drawback was that here was no bath in the en suite.Definately an experience worth repeating! Take my advice on this one and book yourself in."
66,1138,"Sep 25 2007	Good but not perfect!	The Sanderson is a fun hotel which takes itself a little too seriously. Upon check in I was surprised to be asked if we needed help with our bags-not quite what I had expected, there was also a lack of doormen too! Some of the staff have a slightly arrogant attitude and can bit perhaps a little abrupt. The rooms are comfortable and modern but nothing luxurious or particularly unusual really. The mini bar is very expensive with a water costing 4 and a mars bar 3.50 but to be expected I would imagine. We drank in both bars-I can't fault the cocktail bar but felt the other bar was a tad pretentious and was very under staffed. All in all we had a great time but I wouldn't rush back as overall I felt we have had better experiences in similar priced hotels."
67,1138,"Sep 11 2007	hype 	I have stayed at this hotel for more than ten days and here are my views:the location is great, close to almost everywherethe rooms are interesting and so sexy and are comfortablehousekeeping may be a problem. if you leave your telephone dischanger on the floor while leaving the room in a rush, you will find it sitting on the floor when you are back in your room. and do not expect a wonderful housekeeping service. just average. for the money you are paying, you expect them to be more attantive and careful.minibar is the most expensive one I have ever come acrossthe bar is very very hype and trendydo not , but do not take the cars waiting in front of and recommended by the hotel cause they are cheating (the big luxury looking cars!). take a black cap or walk until oxford street and f?nd a cap."
68,1138,Sep 10 2007 	Modern Chic and Sexy	Stayed at the Sanderson for two nights for a romantic weekend in London. Greeted very warmly at the front desk and given key to our loft suite room 608. The rooms are very spacious and incredibly crisp with clean lines. A massive sleigh bed sits in the centre of the room with only a glass partition separating you from the basin shower and free standing bath - very sexy. Everything you would need from a top notch hotel room from double bath to umbrellas and a massive balcony to enjoy a drink on.We ate in the room on our first night and the food was excellent as it came from their Asian style cooking restaurant.The only negative was we ordered a chauffeur from the concierge to take us to a concert but he did not turn up. The hotel then very quickly arranged another car to take us and bring us back.The Sanderson is the best hotel I have stayed in for some time and the staff and amenities are first class. It is very expensive but well worth it for that special weekend.
69,1138,"Aug 30 2007 	Is Sanderson too cool by far? Surely not!	Stayed at Sanderson for a weekend to celebrate my 7th wedding anniversary. First impressions are deceiving as from the outside it looks like a dodgy 80s office block but the lobby is filled with interesting furniture and this prepares you for the extravagance of Sandersons interior.We arrived at 15:30 but were told our room was not ready so were shown to the bar and given a complementary drink will we waited. The reception staff are very helpful and approachable.We chose to sit outside at one of the few tables not already reserved. Annoyingly as soon as we sat down a waitress came round flinging reserved signs on all of the tables outside. So book a table outside when you book your room if you want a drink when you arrive or in the evening. Our room was ready when we finished our drinks.The room was spectacular. We stayed in a loft king, 110 I think. Oh and the lift is very nice. Pitch black with a holographic start field on the walls! Bed was great, bathroom great but another hotel whose cool shower leaks all over the floor! The best bit was the roof terrace where we could sit out in the morning having a lazy breakfast, extended in this case given the very generous check out time of 12:00.We didn't use the hotel restaurant but the bar gets VERY busy. The billiard bar is very nice indeed.All in all a great hotel. Would I stay again....of course!"
70,1138,"Aug 7 2007 	Very Different	Hotel was very modern and ran into a couple of celebs here. room was small but nice, only thing was found it difficult to get the air conditioning to blow cool air, because of this room was quite stuffy! very expensive to drink here, and residence bar closes early so beware!! no tea making facilities in the room but overall the location was nice, staff were very friendly and did enjoy!"
71,1138,"Aug 7 2007 	Cocktails to die for!	My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson for a two day break for his Birthday.We enjoyed an excellent experience from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left.I was a bit worried that the staff would be a bit too &quot;beautiful&quot; to help - but I could not have been more wrong. They could not have done enough to make sure our stay was as pleasurable as possible.If you have the budget then I would definitely recommend one of the Forest Suites with a balcony. We booked Suite 606 and it was amazing and very well appointed. The air-con was especially welcome during the muggy evenings.The room service was prompt and of an excellent standard. The breakfasts were great and the cocktails in the Purple Bar were to die for! I would definitely recommend a stay at the Sanderson. It's not a family hotel - but great for romantic breaks in the old smoke."
72,1138,"Aug 7 2007 	Best Hotel I have ever stayed in!!!	Do not believe the bad reviews this is the best hotel in London, All the staff are friendly and will do anyting to help you. This was a birthday suprise for me and I was so impressed, Stayed in the loft room 130 and had a gorgeous massive bed and bathroom with bath and shower! view of the restaurant below. hotel is within walking distance of China town and central soho so good for drinking. Purple bar is gorgeous and the chairs are of normal size (I noticed a below comment about the seats being small!!) Staff always greet you with a smile and room service is very quick had breakfast delivered to the room which was perfect. The hotel is trendy comfortable and good fun not your boring traditional hotel. I would recomend it to anyone! If I could move in I would Love it!!!! :-)"
73,1138,"Jun 20 2007	obsessed!!!!!	My bf and i stayed here ( i convinced his sweet little self) and it was really fun. Would not bring a family here, but for what we wanted it was awesome! The bar at night was packed and lots of fun (fri night),expensive drinks, trendy rooms. But walking distance to shoppinggreat concierge and fun at night. Would def. stay here again. The rooms are funky and stylish, same with the hotel. Its a young hip crowd and you dont have to leave to hotel to have a great fri evening.But, although the concierge was friendly the italian restaurant accross the street they 'got us in at last minute' was only- ok...try and find somewhere else. Also- dont go to Nobu- very $$, crappy tiny rolls and obnoxious waiters that dont even let you finish your food with out taking your plate. Ok, im getting sidetracked. We left the sanderson early sat morning but got a full english breakfast. Although im a brit this was SERIOUSLY good and worth every bite! Also the guys at the front door already knew the heathrow express was delayed and totally saved us from missing our flight. Its hot!"
74,1138,Jun 3 2007	Guaranteed fun if you are alone or meeting one of your Londoner pals	Ask for Ian or Jasper. Fun lobby. Bartenders are flirtatious. Food is good. You can get into the latest clubs if you stay here.
75,1138,"May 14 2007 	Over rated	This hotel is supposed to be the ultimate in luxury, despite all the rave reviews I feel otherwise. Yes the decor is very trendy and different, but I actually felt like I was in Ikea. The toilets were clean and the soap could have been from Tesco, locks didnt work and the sanitary bins were broken. The corridors looked like they had just had emulsion of a trendy colour slapped and that was it! Our room was a basic room, but I have stayed in rooms with better facilities in a travel inn! The toiletries were non-existent, no cotton wool, or tissues, there was no kettle or tea making facilities, I rang reception for a kettle but it never arrived. The room was pokey and small, the only plus point was the hair dryer which was better then your average hotel dryer. The spa is well over rated, you sit in a big room with drapes and that is it, I am sorry but for the price I expect a little more then a chair a couple of apples and lots of white curtain. I did have a treatment, again you were surrounded by white curtain, this gave one the feeling of being in hospital rather then a luxury spa, also you could here the groups of girls talking in the chill out room, hardly what I would call relaxing. We ordered lunch which took over 30 mins to arrive, I had a chicken club sandwich, which cost 23, but was on cheap white bread, the salad was very poor as well and the dressing tasted like it had been made out of vegetable oil! As for the price of drinks, I was appalled, maybe I am a little out of touch, but 15 for a cocktail that took ages to arrive, is not my idea of a bargain.The long bar, yes is very cool, but also very presumptuous, the staff were very slow to serve and once again it cost a fortune, at around 12.00 I was told in a rather abrupt was to remove myself from the outside terrace area by a member of staff as they were closing it. There are ways of asking people in a polite way to leave the area.In short this hotel is trying to be trendy and chick, however the decor in trendy and cheap, and the drinks and drinking areas trendy, expensive and presumptuous! Sorry but take me to the Dorchester or Claridges next time!"
76,1138,"May 12 2007 	Great Bed!	Loved this hotel. The room was unique but very comfortable. I loved the bed. I liked the curtain as a bathroom wall. The shower was full and forceful. Blackout shades. Fun, lively scene at hotel bar. Restaurant pretty outdoorsy setting. Very short stroll to Oxford Street and Tube station. My only complaint - I could not find an electric outlet in the bathroom!"
77,1138,"Apr 30 2007 	Sanderson is Fabulous	The Sanderson is an ultra modern hotel near Oxford Circus Tube. It's similar to the St. Martin's Lane but much nicer, friendlier and the rooms are bigger. This is not a place where you can have privacy -- so it should be a close couple that books this room. It is very clean, beautifuly maintained. The lobby is total scene but there is quite bar just for patrons of the hotel. The service was excellent. We loved Ian the concierge who took great care of us -- got us into all the great restaurants. The location is good (near SoHo, West End, Covent Garden) to everything but Oxford is a very busy street."
78,1138,"Apr 20 2007 	Best Breakfast!	My boyfriend booked us in here for my birthday as a surprise. Although some of the room decor seemed a little tired I loved the well sized room and beautiful big bed. The spa is a little overpriced and with next to no internal walls, I felt slightly nervous about being almost completely starkers! Purple bar was good although empty on the evening we visited. Cocktails very good but typically not that cheap. 9 for a 'classic' and 14 for a more modern drink. Well worth a go but if you're on a budget, I'd stick with one or two.I can't say enough about breakfast. It really was fantastic. Lots of choice and beautifully cooked. Fantastic fruit, croissants, pain au chocolat, yogurts and muffins were also available. The non-resident clientale seemed a little snobby though and I did get the impression that some people were there just to be seen. A little sad but don't let this put you off. Beautiful hotel and great service throughout our stay. Give it a go!"
79,1138,"Apr 5 2007 	Still leading the pack	I have stayed at The Sanderson several times with work over the years and whilst it is beginning to show it's age, it is still a great destination hotel. Obviously I would never be able to afford its published rates but each visit has been booked through websites and it works out as not much more than one of the better chains like Raddisson Edwardian. The staff have always been very charming, the room whilst no longer so fabulously trendy is still great fun and the cocktails in the Long Bar are wonderful. We were there mid-week and there were loads of people being turned away from the bar.Only downsides this stay was a lack of bar-food and the silly prices for the minibar and things like coffee."
80,1138,"Mar 12 2007 	style wothout substance	Very funky lobby with very pleasant staff. Purple bar had highly uncomfortable tiny seats , long bar very very crowded. &quot;Space ship&quot; lift could have been at home at Disney's, corridors had minimal lighting which I found a bit naff. If you like net curtains than this is the hotel to go for, they were used everywhere in the room as screen/dividers. No heated towel rail, mirror at &quot;funky&quot; angle in order to make it difficult to put on make up. A wardrobe (a rail hiding behind a net curtain) in the bathroom is NOT stylish, nor is the socket for the hairdryer near the floor in the bedroom. WOW-there was a picture on the ceiling above the bed!I think they are just trying too hard to be different and for nearly 300 a night I expect style AND comfort. An experience, but not to be repearted."
81,1138,"Feb 14 2007 	Sophisticated chic and trendy	We stayed here for two nights end of Jan, '07, and we had a great time in what can only be described as a complete design experience. Having read other TA reviews, I was expecting pouting staff looking gorgeous but completely useless; I was pleasantly surprised to see that the staff were some of the most hospitable I have encountered in a large hotel. They were polite, informative and extremely friendly in a very sincere way - not what you usually get from this type of place!The communal areas are fab., with a great and vibrant bar wich serve lovely cocktails and wines. The long central bar feels a little bit posy, but I guess the whole place is. The private bar was quiet on both nights we were there - early in the week - but is fun and decadent. The martini collection is nothing if impressive.Our room was a good size with a big sleigh bed and a running machine! White floor to ceiling curtains seperate the bathroom which was sleek, clean and of course trendy. (Only shower, no bath). Plenty of nice toiletries. Spa was an experience - the hot stone body massage, whilst pricey, was brilliant. It's a must see area of the hotel so do have go!Overall highly recommended as a great treat - didn't get chance to try the restaurant but it looks similarly stylish. Will definitely stay again."
82,1138,"Feb 9 2007 	An expensive disappointment	280 a night for a small room with tiny shower and no bath. Noisy fans outside room. Head of housekeeping possibly the rudest man I have ever come into contact with. Price quoted was ex vat so nice surprise of 80 on my bill as I checked out. If you value style over any kinf od substance or comfort this could be the place for you. By the way - if you thought the rooms were expensive, don't even venture to the bar where if the surly barmen will condescend to serve you you'll be asked to extract a kidney as payment - oh yes and it's extra for crisps. My 6am coffee was... 8.50 plus 3.50 for a biscuit. That's right 12 for a capuccino and a biscuit. Bargain"
83,1138,"Jan 27 2007 	Unique!	My new husband booked us 2 nights at this hotel as a surprise - and what an amazing stay! I had been to the bar before so I knew the decor was not that of your average hotel, but as it inhabits an old office block I was slightly dubious about how nice the rooms could be - how wrong I was! We had a HUGE room with silver sleigh bed, and everything else except a silver chair and red rug was pure white, with layers of net drapes and beautiful lighting to create different moods. The bathroom and double ended bath were equally big, with great products and more sexy lighting. The whole hotel is ultra modern and minimalist with very individual touches but it can be slightly overwhelming and waiting in the lobby one evening I definitely felt a little out of place without any designer glad rags on! I agree with previous reviews that this is a place to see and be seen so if that's not your thing, then a night or two for the experience and top central location should be enough - it is very expensive mind!"
84,1138,"Jan 25 2007	Hip hotel - Stay a night for the novelty factor or if you wish to be 'seen'	Stayed here for a week in November. It is a hip hotel popular with upcoming stars trying to get themselves seen and footballers. But I can't help but think it is all gets a little too much after a while. This is where Madonna did her interview screened on Oprah after the adoption of David so it does pull the stars ... but unfortunately all the staff are also waiting to be 'discovered' and most of the time it is difficult to get served as they are more interested in posing and preening themselves- that is unless you tip big! Imogen from BB was a receptionist here ... need I say more????Anyway - on to the review - The interior of the hotel is all sleek and white with a pitch black lift up to the room - unfortunately the standard rooms are absolutely tiny - even though they are very modern in terms of design and layout. But they are absolutely spotless with a crisp white and silver image. The first night there was an all night party in a nearby room (a famous guest apparently who they ended up asking to leave). The party was never ending, even after many visits from security, however the next day I was upgraded to a huge suite with free standing bath, sleigh bed, and separate lounge area! this room was enormous and very impressive. On checking out I was told that this room normally costs STG 750 per night - so aI was glad of the upgrade but I really don't think it would have been worth that sort of money. I also saw a delux room as I had a friend staying there ...and while slightly bigger, it would be considered a standard room in any other 5* hotel.The Long bar and the Purple bar are both nice but very small and it is difficult to get a seat in the long bar there when they are busy. The price of both the drinks and the finger food in the bars is quite pricy - more overpriced than most 5*'s in London - even the Ritz! Towards the end of the week the long bar is buzzing from about 4pm in the evening with lots of local business people and the glamorous set! At one stage I counted 11 bar staff behind the small bar - but yet there was no one to serve a drink. I ordered the dessert tasting plate another day and it took 50 minutes before i got it! It seemed if youtip high you are assured personal service both from the bar staff and the door staff - but otherwise they can't be bothered! But be warned - the amount of times guy's tried to pick me up in the hotel was unbelievable.. .even in the corridors to the rooms I was propositioned. It seems there are a lot of call girls working in this hotel regularly (you can even find them wandering around floors knocking on rooms) - so for a single woman it is a bit of a nightmare to sit in the bar if you are alone and don't want that sort of attention. Men even waited for me outside the ladies asking if i was looking for a good time!There was a fight in the Purple bar one night when a drunk group of 2 girls/2 guys were ordering cocktails and no-one was paying - the staff handled it well and called out one of the guys who was staying in the hotel to tell him he was being used by the two girls. Thee appeared to be a lot of free loaders or hangers on hanging around the hotel most of the time - this was a complete turnoff as you felt everyone was insincere as a result! The Billiards room also was closed off most of the time for private parties. Another gripe about the purple bar is that the hostess was always asking if you were on the VIP list to gain entry there - and thjen when you went in it was always practically empty.If you want to get away from it all then there is a very relaxing seating area near the treatment room - all in white - where there was absolutely no noise and it was a nice getaway from the fuss. The gym is also impressive with lots of equipment and in the week I was there I never saw anyone else use it.All in all I would recommend this hotel for a night out in London (Just don't book a standard room)- Fantastic location near SoHo and the West End for shows etc - but if you are a looking for 5* treatment, luxury plush surrounding and a relaxing environment - then stay elsewhere. Note - I've found that this hotel is often available as a 'top secret hotel' on Lastminute at a much reduced rate so worth taking a look there!"
85,1138,"Jan 9 2007 	Funky 	On arrival reception was full off eye catching bits, lips sofa, sliver thrown, long chaise longe, pictures of dogs heads, alien chair, the bar was busy and the music was pumping (2 in the afternoon) All staff were very helpful especially doormen and reception, check in was quick and friendly we were shown to our room via the stepping into a space themed lift and given quick but informative details about the hotel. Rooms are amazing all clean, modern, elegant sleigh beds, glass walls, flowing curtains, ceiling to floor mirrors, running machine and weights (not used haha) desk/dressing table. Bathrooms were fun nice products, lovely bath, fun free standing sink!! Long Bar equally as busy in the evening great cocktails, purple bar less busy and more intimate!! Breakfast was fab (22.00) so try and get it included in the package delish pastries, fruit, cereals and juices followed by a posh fry up all served until 12 which is a bonus!! Overal Fun stay, funky, modern, lively not ideal for anyone over 40 unless young at heart!!Minor thing the bar is loud and can be heard in rooms facing the centre court of the hotel for an early night or less noisy stay ask for a street facing room!!"
86,1138,"Jan 8 2007 	Absolute top experience	Hoteliers, send your managers and staff to Sanderson to learn how a hotel shall be operated and guests should be treated!After staying the last four days at Sanderson, me and my wife talks about the staff and the value of having the right people onboard at a hotel. -Sandersons has a staff that I wish all the people staying at hotels should have the opportunity to meet.We have been staying at many upper class hotels over the years and I must say that Sanderson is the best one we have ever experienced as to the overall picture in which ,as you may have already understood, the staff plays a very very important role.Go here if you are young at mind, experience how good things are at a hotel where the staff is proud to work and proud to give you all the service you would ever dream of, all on a personal basis.Peter G"
87,1138,"Jan 5 2007 	unforgetable.	I have been wanting to stay at the sanderson for a long time now since i am a big fan of cutting edge design hotels and of designer Philippe stark in particular.I booked a deluxe room for new years eve weekend  28/12/06-1/1/07 and was hoping for a very romantic and memorable stay in this very famous hotel on this very special time of the year.i got everything i wished for.The design  well it is truly fabulous  different then any other hotel I ever stayed at in the world: it is unexpected, beautiful, original, amazing and you cant get enough of it. It is like a perfect bizzar dream, if you know what i mean.Front desk  the staff at the sanderson are young and friendly. They treated us with perfect manner. we arrived at the hotel at 9 am and immediately were given a room although check in time was 3 pm! Concierge  was helpful and even got us a table at &quot;j-sheeky&quot; restaurant on a Saturday evening! (one of the hottest seafood spots in town with an impossible waiting list)The deluxe room not words nor pictures can truly describe how wonderful and pleasant It really was. Sized about 42 sqm. The bed was very large, very very beautiful and incredibly comfortable. The floor was wooden, the bath area was spacious and included a stand alone bath, a walk in shower, a toilette  all designed magnificently. In fact every item you find in the room is superb  from the toiletries to the towels  to the amazing sofa  to the picture on the ceiling.Dont be nervous about the &quot;see through bathroom&quot;  when you use the electrical curtains it becomes completely privet and the whole room get amazing colored lighting effect that makes it feel very heavenly and sensual. The aqua spa  is b-e-a-t-i-f-u-l. Book a massage and you will enter another dimension.The purple bar  is for the use of hotel guests only. It is small, dark, extremely cool and relaxed. Amazingly designed.The long bar  hip trendy and buzzing  not our cup of tea although very stylish indeed.Courtyard  stunning. The gym  spacious with cutting edge equipment. The billiard room  again, so beautiful!Location  prefect  2 min from oxford and regent streets, 7 min from soho and fabulous covent garden.Prices  when you come to London you should prepare yourself for the fact that you are coming to one of the most expensive cities in the world. And the sanderson definitely lives to it's city's rep. it is extremely expensive to stay at the sanderson. Everything costs even cocktails start at 11 pounds and I dont even want to start telling you about the prices of the spoon restaurant or the room service. It is EXPENSIVE!Summery  if you got the cash  you really got to give the sanderson a try. It is not just a beautiful hotel to sleep in - it is an amazing experience that makes you feel very special and to me  worth the money.* dont book any room except the deluxe or one of the lofts. We asked to see The smaller &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; rooms to check out the dcor and they were small enough to really piss you off!"
88,1138,"Jan 4 2007 	Fun 	Hotel very minimalistic and modern, with some lovely features. Staff very pleasant &amp; helpful.Only one gripe:-Having my son &amp; his girlfriend return to the Hotel with us to enjoy a night cap, the staff in the Purple Bar commenced covering the optics with clingfilm and even mopped the bar floor, whilst we sat with our guests. Not what I had expected for such a hip Hotel!!"
89,1138,"Dec 12 2006 	Funky Quirky and Surreal	Words cannot fully describe this hotel and photos would not do it justice. This hotel is amazing and really different from what else is on offer in London. As you walk up to the hotel, the outside of the building looks quite plain and standard, however as soon as you step into the lobby it is like Alice stepping through the looking glass into another dimension. The lobby has a pop art feel to it with a different types of furniture dotted around the place and there are unusual framed paintings of dogs looking straight at you. As you step into the lift, you are encased in an almost pitch black 3D outer space environment with funky music playing. There is a beautifully designed Billiard room near the lobby which also features several strange pieces of furniture such as chairs with mammoth horns coming out of it. The long bar is buzzing at night, and everyone looks young and trendy. My husband and I stayed in a Deluxe Room with a city view. The room does have a wow factor to it. The room is all white and silver and minimalist which makes the room look crisp and clean. The bed is placed diagonally across the room and there is a painting directly over it. There are so many cool features, from a giant egg sculpture next to the chair, silver dumbbells on the wall to little silver tea-light candles lit at turndown. The bathroom is separated by a clear glass wall and one sheer curtain and one thick curtain, there was a small sink and a free standing bathtub, next to this space is a walk-in shower and the toilet which are both separated by opaque glass, there are no internal walls. There is no wardrobe and the only place to hang clothes is on a clothes rack in the bathroom area. This hotel is lovely especially if you are looking for something modern and different. It is fun, funky, quirky, trendy and very surreal and I cannot wait to go back again."
90,1138,"Nov 26 2006 	The Nightclub Residential Experience	There is so much to say about this hotel! Other reviews will mention the high prices, the long bar and the pictures above the bed so I won't go into detail on them. I shall instead write briefly about my overall impressions of the overall experience we had here.I would say the whole place is like a trendy nightclub. The lifts are pitch black, with illuminated walls shining patterns of stars and planets, and loud funky music. The corridors leading to the rooms are also very dark. The music is a recurring motif of the hotel - at breakfast it was pretty loud too! In our room there was even a CD that you could buy of the hotel's 'soundtrack'.Our deluxe room had lots of nice little details that we enjoyed, ranging from the Phillipe Starck dumbells on the wall to the lovely, weighty little alarm clocks and the stylish glass-walled shower room (You can do great 'Evil Genius' impressions in there thanks to the superb echo!). The transparent walls ensure that you and your significant other will never be out of each other's sight - so this is a place that couples may enjoy more than lone business travellers.We found the service to be very friendly and efficient. All the staff were good-looking and trendy, and far from stuck-up as could have been the case.The other residents seemed to be mid- to late thirties upwards, and looked well-off (well, you'd have to be wouldn't you?). Come nightfall, the bars are packed with attractive people in their late-20s upwards and you begin to really see the whole point of the hotel. The transition from bar to bedroom is seamless as an experience.So in summary - yes the long bar is great, yes the purple bar is smoky, and yes the pool table always seems to be taken, but if you're young (or young at heart!), well-heeled and are after a residential nightclub experience, this is probably the place to get it."
91,1138,"Nov 25 2006	Overrated achingly hip however achingly uncomfortable	A five star hotel should be: comfortable, discreet, glamourous, clean with impeccable serviceI absolutely despise this place or maybe I am a bit too old for it, late thirties. It feel like an expensive nightclub with bedrooms instead of a hotel. The constant music piping in the lifts, are intially ok, but following a few trips can be incredbily annoying. My room, merely a standard room was pretty awful considering how much I paid for it. The bathroom floor was stained, a permanent stain, I hasten to add. Toiletries minimal, however you could purchase a few more, 'purchase' being the operative word, the dressing gowns were washed out and scratchy. As for its hipness, well a boxy sony television is hardly cool these days!Not to mention the purple bar which is really overpriced!As for the doorman, well they tend to disappear on a regular basis!The hotel saving grace is the long bar, which has an increbile vibe. The Sanderson no more, give me the Four Seasons, Dorchester or Claridges any day..................Canadian and British hotels!"
92,1138,Sep 29 2006 	One in a million	From check in to check out I felt really special. The bellman treated me so kindly with all their assitance.I found the entrance to the hotel almost took my breath away. You just don't find many hotels in the world quite like the Sanderson. The little touches like the candle in the room and the amazing aqua spa. Which I would go everyday if I could. I was very surprised at some of the negative remarks made on this site about the Sanderson as could not find a floor with this hotel. You feel like you are in another place when staying there. I will be back very soon.
93,1138,"Sep 12 2006	not enough bang for your buck - for me anyhow	myself and my husband stayed here while he was in London on business, the reviews of the hotel looked good and its in a great location.From the outside, the hotel looks dreadful, inside, things get much better, the lobby is cool, but i'm not sure if it makes a cohesive whole....the receptionists are all good looking, dressed in black - quite trendy rather than chic. The lifts are dark - think night sky, i found them too weird,,,,Our room was a standard and like another reviewer, the tv was totally wrong in the room. Also, there were stains on the walls, which are very obvious in an all white room - lastly, although our room was non-smoking, I definitely got the smell of smoke in the room - didn't ask to be moved however, as we were jsut too rushed for time. The picture did fall off the ceiling narrowly missing my husband - the hotel did absolutely nothing by way of an apology, which for me says it all....We had planned to stay in the hotel for dinner, the outdoor terrace is lovely, however, after a mediocre lunch - club sambo for 17 quid, we decided not to bother and headed elsewhere. We came back to the hotel for drinks and were very disappointed - we were not allowed to have a drink outside - it was a sunday and was about 11.30 and instead headed into the purple bar, which was full of smoke and very low seating. The service was terribleOverall, great location and very trendy, but they have some way to go to deliver the service their prices demand"
94,1138,"Aug 8 2006 	pricey..but worth the experience	We knew we were going to pay a lot to stay here, but I love splurging on cool hotels for the experience, and the Sanderson was pretty much worth it. There were a few hiccups with our room rate (they had us down for a more expensive rate but I had the confirmation with our actual rate which they honored when I showed them the printout) and they also inadvertantly checked someone else into our room while we were out to lunch. But their head concierge Ian was fabulous and upgraded us to a king suite with terrace which was unbelievable. I found the staff very nice and helpful and although it was very expensive for drinks at the bar and any add ons...anyone who books this quality of hotel should anticipate such charges. Definitely recommended if you are willing to splurge and looking for a unique experience."
95,1138,"Jul 23 2006 	Favorite hotel in the world	Sanderson is definately my favorite hotel. This was my second stay and it was even better. The standard rooms are a little smaller than the superior but they are just as much fun. Everything is very clean and modern. I love the curtains and the glass between the bathroom and room. All of the staff are friendly if you are staying at the hotel and it is easy to get something if you need it. The Long Bar is always fun and makes some of the best drinks in London, as does the Purple Bar. The lobby is a scene and always fun to walk through. The agua spa is amazing, really one of a kind, and has great massages. The restaurant is nice in the summer because you can sit in the outside terrace which is beautiful. The food is good but for the money I'd recommend Asia de Cuba at the St Martins Lane. The location is also perfect as it is right near Oxford Street and Soho, everything is walking distance, good for restaurants and nightlife. It's very expensive but I'll come back whenever I have the chance."
96,1138,"Jul 13 2006	Cold room cold staff cold experience	I've stayed in some of the best hotels in London and abroad and this by far achieved the ugly title of worst yet. I took my partner here as we were attracted to the fashionable modern appearance and location in the centre of London. By all accounts the Hotel was trendy, seemed to be buzzing and the staff were attractive and dressed well. However they were also shockingly aloof and arrogant, quite patronising and clearly disinterested in anything other than how their hair looked or whether they could stiff you for a few extra quid! The room was quite dirty (a deluxe) and everything was at an added cost. Where did my 500 go? Although the minimalist appearance was quite kitch and unusual I really didn't think it warranted the premium I had to pay. I'd expect better service in a 2 star in Peckham. For example; they suggested we should get a cab to our chosen restaurant (a short walk away, say 15 mins) which we initially objected to, and then they persuaded us that 'it's ok we'll get one of our cars to take you' which seemed good of them, only to find it had a 10 premium on the fare, they gave us the impression it was free nevermind more than normal! I asked, and checked twice, for a bottle of champagne to be put in the room on arrival, there was none. We were told rooms weren't available until 3, and despite asking several times they really didn't have any flexibility in this at all, and became quite rude when I asked if I could ask them to make an exception. The bar staff were rubbish and seemed to want to wind us up. Altogether I had a good night as I was partying in London, but I would definitely not recommend you go unless you have serious cash to burn for very little reward. I got the impression they get very little repeat business and because of their location they didn't care! My experience would have been just as good in a two star, seriously."
97,1138,"Jul 13 2006	The Staff made it an enjoyable (but pricey) stay	From the minute we pulled up in the cab the staff at the sanderson made us feel important and special. All details, even storing important camera equipment while the room was turned, was addressed professionally, with courtesy, and concern. Gary escorted us to our room, i felt weird because i called it a &quot;freak show&quot;.....it was small, no view, the windows didn't open, faced a fire escape, no bathtub, etc. I'm not a big &quot;Boutique Hotel&quot; person, but the trendiness certainly made up for it in other places in the hotel. It really is like being in a big art piece. The long bar is clean, functional, and loaded with energy and good looking people. Cocktails were created with verve and panache, and were very tasty. Questions were answered and care was given with every interaction with the staff. Be prepared to spend! Took three friends out in the courtyard restaurant, had a few drinks and appetizers, the lobster salad, and a seared tuna, bill was $450. Room for two nights was $1000., but it did include continental breakfast, where i had very yummy oatmeal. The neighborhood was alive and too full of people, reminicent of Times or Herald Squares in NYC. Conversion rate is definitely not good right now."
98,1138,"Jun 1 2006	Style over substance?	I am a designer and I have, for some time, had an ambition to stay at this hotel. I was not disappointed, It does have a WOW factor and it is visually exciting. All the public areas are beautifully designed and unlike many hotels you actually want to spend time there. The bedrooms however are not quite as successful. We had a double room, probably the cheapest room rate and I cannot comment on more expensive rooms. The room was quite small, all white with a double bed positioned in the centre of the space. The bathroom (with shower only) is a glass cubicle with curtains. The loo was 'bog standard' no evidence of Philippe Starck here! The shower did not work and flooded the floor. The shaver point was impossibly positioned in relation to the mirrors and the sink with no plug made washing contact lenses a chore. The heating system was irratic. So although it looked fantastic It was not a pleasure to use. This is an expensive hotel. A pot of tea after our night out cost 14.Why do hotels charge such silly amounts for basics like tea and water? It irritates and makes you think the whole place is a rip off. A word about the staff: fantastic! The Charm School has done a good job!"
99,1138,"May 29 2006 	OK But Watch Out for the Purple Bar	Everything would have been rated as top notch were it not for a snotty hostess in the Purple Bar. I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and each night she asked me if I was a guest at the hotel, while she clearly did not ask others the same question. Usually, I had to ask for the bill more than once, one night I actually stood up and waited for her to bring it. I once was there with a business client and his jacket unknowingly fell to the floor. Rather than picking it up, she just kicked it aside with her foot. Totally unprofessional behavior for a hotel of such a high caliber (and price)."
100,1138,"May 18 2006	Super cool	The Sanderson is my favorite of the Schrager hotels. The lobby is hip and bar are hip, as expected. The service is impeccable and the rooms are a slice of heaven. You are enveloped in a sea of white - curtains, bedding, floors, walls and feel like you're floating on a cloud. I loved escaping to my room after a hectic day of sightseeing. To top it off, the location is perfect for being on top of all the action. I can't wait to be back in London and stay here again!"
101,1138,"May 15 2006	We were not disappointed	We loved the clean modern esthetics of the room. Everything was bright white, from the walls, the furniture and the bedding, but done in a tasteful understated yet quirky way. There was a glass wall with gauzy curtains that separated the main bedroom from the bathroom and the room itself was quite big (we were on the top floor, and this may have been one of the deluxe room). I used the wonderful stand-alone bathtub several times during the trip and the bubble bath they provide is quite decadent.The hotel is located in a convenient area, about three block from the nearest tube station (Goodge street). The street is safe and quiet, though only about two blocks away from the shopping madness of Oxford Street. The staff was quite friendly and helpful, and the hotel itself is hip and trendy with a very &quot;happening&quot; bar scene. Definitely more designed for the younger crowd.As several other reviewers mentioned, this is not a hotel for everyone. If you have more traditional taste, and like rooms with antiques and chintz, Sandersons is not for you."
102,1138,"May 8 2006	A hotel to remember...	I took my partner to stay at the Sanderson Hotel as a surprise for his birthday, and we loved every minute of it. We stayed only one night and from the moment we arrived we appreciated the quirky and modern nature of the hotel. The front desk staff were incredibly friendly and really made us feel right at home, despite the fact we are probably not their usual clientele (we were dressed more trendy/student than designer/chic)! They informed us they were fully booked in their standard accommodation and we were upgraded several levels to a Deluxe King. The room was fantastic and in my opinion of a more than adequate size. The bed was immense and the best I have ever spelt in, with soft duvets and plenty of pillows. The decoration was intriguing and while modern, never felt sparse or uncomfortable. We especially enjoyed the picture on the ceiling! The pink and white curtains which surrounded the room provided a sensual atmosphere, and the fact they were electrically controlled also ensured they were practical as well as looking great. We loved this feature, as did we the lighting, which is versatile in creating different moods while keeping the room bright and airy. I will echo from the previous reviews that the bathroom does not have &quot;walls&quot; as such, but panes of glass which separate it from the room. The curtains can be pulled across to give you some privacy. The shower was large, strong, powerful and hot. Being a fan of Starcks' designs I loved the fixtures. We did not use the standalone bath but it was a nice feature to have. The towels were as large as bedsheets, and the bathrobes were an excellent touch.Yes, the mini bar is expensive but nobody makes you use it. We did not sample room service nor have time to visit either the restaurant or the two bars, but they were both busy and full of life. The public areas of the hotel are all interesting and well presented, with the unique elevators taking the staring role!This hotel is clearly not for everyone, but for us it was a fun and memorable night away in an ideal location. The room upgrade, the little candle lit in the room when we entered, the superb and friendly service at front desk all made it unique. It is expensive, and in all honesty perhaps a little overpriced, but if you're going to blow the budget you'd struggle to find a more fun place to do so than the Sanderson!"
103,1138,"Apr 13 2006	Sanderson great	First the Sanderson is in a great location to visit London. Soho, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue, Oxford Street and Hyde Park are all close by. If you re prepared to walk for 30-45 mins Knightsbridge and the Museums are also within reach. Perfect, we were there for three nights and never used the tube. OK it looks quite expensive but not really in London terms. The staff are excellent concierge and booking in staff very friendly and efficient especially helpful in guiding you to restaurants etc even printed us a map to allow us to walk to a restaurant without a problem.The rooms are quite small and extremely modern(think hospital room white) but everything works well i.e showers etc although our rooms TV was quite old not at all in keeping with the room.The Purple Bar is great after a night out in town only small but very busy and friendly. Not sure about the long bar only stayed there very briefly too many people celeb spotting for me! Finally the breakfasts where extremely good and my girlfriend said I had to mention the lifts they are great playing the best tunes I heard in London that weekend.I ll be back soon!"
104,1138,"Apr 10 2006	What an experience	Sanderson is absolutely a must!! Rooms are not so big, but it is simply stilish..coming back in the afternoon I found candles light up..could you imagine a white room lighted by candles?The SPA is just the entering room of Heaven!Bars and cocktails are more that 5 stars rated!Thanks Sanderson!"
105,1138,"Mar 20 2006 	Fab - As usual!	Sanderson is such a great hotel, the rooms are trendy and cool, very comfortable in every way. The bar attracts a nice group of people and it's very easy to chat to everyone. Give this place a try! Don't forget your Jimmy Choo's at home, you will need them!"
106,1138,"Mar 1 2006	Celeb spotting	Decided to take a young lady friend to see the delights of the Purple bar.Was not disappointed at all in the place from the moment I met the concierge.I had phoned in advance and asked to enter the purple bar as a non-resident.This, I was told, is never a problem and I received an email saying I was on the guest list and it should be fine to come down on tuesday evening.After browsing the &quot;rather&quot; expensive menu I decided on a martini cocktail......which was so addictive I drank more than 4 of them that evening.On the celebrity side of things I was pleased to have met and spoken to a very friendly young American lady called 'Pink'. She was talking to her small group of 3 friends about her house in the States, her wedding ring ..etc...It was such a private lil hideaway that celebs feel safe, chilling out in the Purple bar, and I felt comfortable bringing my friend there.If you don't mind spending a quite a bit of money then this is your place!!!ENJOY!!"
107,1138,"Feb 23 2006 	Awesome! Amazing! Astonishing! Triple AAA!	Stayed at Sanderson hotel 18-22 February 2006, and it was a fabulous experience. Everything about the hotel is great. The dcor all over the place is fantastic, from the beautiful lobby, the attractive long bar with its striking garden, the intimate purple bar, the lovely billiard room, the sophisticated restaurant, the stunning aqua spa area and the gorgeous rooms. Yes it is definitely a Philip Starch experience and if you dont like that style you should go elsewhere. The service is brilliant. I have been to St Martins lane as well, which is very nice, but this is the flagship! I have stayed at many other top class hotels in London, but this is going to be my regular spot in the future. Go there and experience something different! Enjoy!"
108,1138,"Jan 16 2006	Sanderson - relaxing and sexy	After a very long and stressful 2005, my husband decided to take me for a surprise break to London and we stayed at the Sanderson hotel. My husband has stayed there on business many times. He often talks about the hotel and the staff, but I have never been.The whole experience was simply magical and I think Christmas time in London made it more so.The rooms are very dream-like and very very white (amazingly clean - you can tell that I am a housewife and mother!). A real treat for me was the spa - Agua - I felt as if I had drifted off to another world.Thank you Sanderson. You have chilled out a stressed out Mummy!Fingers crossed that I can visit Sanderson again."
109,1138,Jul 17 2005	Hype - but better than OK	Standard rooms are VERY small and decoration is amusing for a day or two but no longer. Premium rooms are very expensive - one can find better for one's money.Service is excellent.Bars are good - restaurant is poor.Trendy.Good for a weekend on the town.
110,1138,"Jul 5 2005 	superb hotel and service	Second time at the hotel on a business trip. Excellent service from check in to check out. Room service is a bit overpriced and foreign exchange rates are not competitive although there is a FX exchange within a five minute walk. Agua spa is woth a visit, buy book ahead for any treatment. Long Bar is a must, noisy and jammed from 6 pm on Friday evenings, but the Purple room is rather quiet. Not for eveyone since this is a non traditional hotel but if you are into design, fashion, media, and music, you will not de disappointed."
111,1138,"Jul 1 2005 	Overrated	Let's start with the obvious - the Long Bar is a great, trendy, very expensive restaurant that's a draw for people in London, and a fun part of staying at this hotel. But I was otherwise very disappointed in this place, as I seem to be lately with all the Shrager properties. The service was inconsistent - ranging from calm and professional to aloof and judgemental. The room were incredibly small, and while chic, it felt cold and impersonal. But what surprised me was that it was quite noisy; I could clearly hear people in the hallway all night long. When I went to check out, there was a huge screw up with extra charges and it took far longer than necessary to get settled, making me nearly miss my flight to the airport. (I was there an extra 40 minutes!) I wouldn't stay here again."
112,1138,"Jun 3 2005	A fantastic Stay	My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson to take a break for the weekend. We arrived on Friday, and found ourselves in a different world. The sleek designs were amazing, and the staff were absolutely amazing. The manager on duty checked us in (Jason?). He knew our names before I had even got to the front desk, and remembered it for the entire stay. We asked for his help a number of times throughout the two nights, and he was always happy to help-truly one of the best i have ever seen. All other staff were only too happy to help, and amazingly intuitive to whatever you could possibly be wanting. Suzie, the concierge, was able to get me into the perfect restaurant for us (at very limited notice), simply by asking me one or two questions, and the cocktails in the purple bar were among the finest we have ever had.I would stay there again and again for a weekend of fun or simply to unwind. The hotel is amazing, but the staff are incredible."
113,1138,"Apr 12 2005	Will never stay here again!	We had won a weekend holiday in London and were booked into the Sanderson hotel. As it was a 5 star luxury hotel we were really looking forward to it. On check in, the receptionist kept clicking away on her computer for ages before we asked if there was a problem and she said &quot;yes, i do not have a booking for you.&quot; We were made to wait for approx 40 mins before they realised that they did have a room for us, apparently there had been some mix up somewhere!!!!We made our way to the lifts only to find it pitch black inside apart from moon and stars decor on the walls, exiting the lift to our floor we found that was also pitch black apart from small lights outside each door illuminating the room numbers. When entering our room it felt like we were in a hospital ward, net curtains in abundance with white walls and bedding.No dressing table, no wardrobe and only one socket (not practical for women who use hairdryers and tongs!!). Prices were ridiculous, cup of coffee @4.62 and a gin and tonic and glass of water in the residents bar 13.50. We actually checked out a day early and were glad to get home to some normality. If you want a futuristic clinical hotel this is it, otherwise don't waste your time....or money!!!!!"
114,1138,"Apr 12 2005	Modern expensive and a bit overrated	If you like minimalistic surroundings, this hotel is the place to be. The rooms are very white and there is hardly any furniture, only a desk and a bed. The bed was lovely though. I usually have trouble sleeping in hotelbeds but not this time. The bathroom was nice. Orange sink, great shower and a green lit mirror. The toilet seemed a bit cheap and it wasn't attached very well. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that there was no closet. I had to leave my clothes in my suitcase. The staff was very friendly and attentive. However, DONT LET THEM ARRANGE A CAB FOR YOU! The hotel has a deal with the most expensive cab-service in London. We partied in the same area for two nights. The first night the hotel arranged a cab for us: We payed 25 pounds. The next night we arranged one ourselves (an official radiotaxi) and only had to pay 6 pounds. The bars in the hotel were very nice and we had some expensive but lovely cocktails. The only negative thing I can think of was that the people in the white bar were a bit pretentious. The hotel is located in Soho, the place to be. But the street in which it is situated is truely the most boring street in Soho. If you are into hip minimalistic designerhotels you can better stay at St. Martins Lane, a hotel of the same group. The rooms were a bit smaller but nicer (with light in adjustable colours) and the location is so much better: in the heart of Soho in a street that is alive and vibrant."
115,1138,"Apr 5 2005	Great Hotel	Spent a weekend at this hotel last month and loved it to bits. The receptionists were great and the camp concierge guy was a scream, coming out with some great one liners. Took my 13 year old daughter who thought he was fab and the hotel ultra cool. COuldnt quite work out initially why check in/check out along with any request was dealt with in such a hassle free way.... then wondered if it was because they were all male?? just a thought.....Great lobby , loved the art and furniture. Lifts are whacky and should think very strange if you were worse for wear! The long bar was very trendy and packed the Sat night we stayed - although trying to get a 13 year old through the bar to the Spoon Restaurant situated at the other end of the bar was not an experience to be repeated although she thought fun! The waiter kindly found us another way back to our room when we had finished. The food and service in Spoon was excellent as was the breakfast the following morning although there wasnt much of it!The room we had was very stylish but as a previous reviewer has mentioned a bit Ikeaish. We tried to book some Spa treatments but apparently have to book weeks in advance so that was a little disappointing but overall a great hotel and would certainly stay again."
116,1138,"Jan 26 2005	Crazy place good time	We arrived in the Sanderson late one night, having travelled for about 15 hours from the Indian sub continent. The bar was busy, a good sign, and the lobby was not crowded with people. The desk staff were very helpful (and attractive!) and we were shown to our room straight away. The lifts were the first &quot;unusual&quot; thing you notice about this hotel, as they were black with dance music playing in the background instead of the usual muzak. Our room smelled of smoke. We weren't sure what to do (we were very tired) but eventually decided we wanted to change, which was quick and efficiently done. The bellboys didn't even grumble when they had to carry all our bags back down to the lobby again (although we did tip generously).Now, here's the thing. The Sanderson is a &quot;hip&quot; hotel, a &quot;minimalist&quot; hotel, whatever that means. If you expect to walk in and find the usual comforting ambience then be prepared for a shock. There is nothing in the room. A big bed in the middle, facing away from the door, turned to an angle. A writing table / headboard behind the bed, with two bed side tables. A TV. Strangely shaped metal weights on the wall. And that's it. Everything is white. We didn't even know where the lockers were!I was very tired and a little moany and wasn't in the mood for the artiness of the place. The toilet / shower doesn't have a door, but a curtain - automatic at that. The sink is free standing and again positioned at an angle in the room. There's an odd painting hanging on the ceiling over the bed. However, once I got in to bed, things started looking up. It was amazing - the sheets and duvet and pillows were all feather and so unbelievabley comfortable. I drifted off in no time.Next morning, we went for breakfast and I am still drooling over it. Fantastic! You don't get much, but what you do get is just super. The best poached eggs I have ever eaten, and the sausages were great. Very attractive, friendly waiting staff.The concierge was hilarious. As camp as they come, he informed us he &quot;wouldn't be seen dead darling!&quot; in Camden, as we asked if he knew the area! A very nice guy though, he helped us find some obscure shop we were looking for. Purple bar was nice, but as mentioned by others, there was no one in it! We met a London friend and had a drink, but even later when we came back from dinner, there was still no one there. The main bar was bustling though. We didn't stay for a drink, we just wanted to get back into that bed!By now I was used to the quirky room. In time I got to love it. If you arrive tired after a long flight it is kinda weird, but if you arrive with an open mind and in the mood for something new, then its great. The door staff were great, helpful for holding taxis and opening doors etc.By the way, don't order room service, absurdly expensive!"
117,1138,Jan 4 2005	We stayed for 'New Year' at the Sanderson	and had an excellent time. The staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. Two very different bars to choose from and the most bizarre lift/elevators around !
118,1138,"Dec 22 2004 	The details could be better for the price...	We stayed at the Sanderson for a week in October. We're familiar with the Morgans Group aesthetic and approach to service, so were not surprised when we arrived at an eclectic, trendy, but comfortable hotel in a prime location.The room was comfortable, and I like the emphasis and space given to the bathroom. My only gripes were the insufficient storage, tiny desk, and charge for internet access.Service-wise, they let us down a few times. First, we were promised an Amex Platinum upgrade at check-in, but it never materialized. After some cajoling, they offered us a slightly bigger room in the same category (&quot;deluxe&quot; at almost $US500 per night). It was still just a room, albeit with a freestanding bath. We also had three separate problems with room service. I think it was mostly a language barrier--don't expect perfect English in London. The concierge was enthusiastic, if not really very inspired--all his suggestions seemed to be too conveniently located in the neighborhood. London is bigger than Soho.The gym is good, and the place has a buzz, but on the whole I would be inclined to try the Kemps' Soho Hotel the next time I want to stay in the neighborhood."
119,1138,"Dec 17 2004	Great Hotel	Enjoyed our stay at the Sanderson very much, a little nervous before we arrived due to some pretty bad reviews, we had already booked and paid for 8 nights in advance so had no choice but to continue with the booking and expected the worst, but we were very surprised with everything, staff, room, gym, breakfast, everything was great, would definately recommend the hotel and if in London again would only stay there...Great location..."
120,1138,"Dec 8 2004	I will come back !	I took my wife to London for our wedding anniversary and we chose the Sanderson for all its hype... and we were not dissapointed ! Everything was excellent, from the room to the staff ! We had an excellent time there drinking martinis at the Long Bar (thank you Roberto), eating at the the Spoon+ and chilling out at the most excellent Purple Bar. Only problem : you just don't want to go out ! If you love design, bars and eating then you will love this place. Just to be honest the Spoon+ isn't the best restaurant out there but it sure is on the top list for trendy eating hideouts."
121,1138,"Nov 16 2004 	Stylish but not great.	I was recently in London on business and looked forward to the peaceful, tranquil minimalist white rooms of the very stylish Sanderson. What I ended up with was a room on the first floor just above the bar which has a live dj and is very noisy. My room was far from peaceful. I called up and asked to be moved and the staff were very polite. They didn't have a room but would call me tomorrow and move me for the remainder of my trip. They didn't call. This went on for days until eventually they closed the bar for a private function. Not only were hotel guests excluded from the bar and dining area, the party had a live band and was EVEN LOUDER. This went on until 1am and the staff could do nothing to help.The room itself was okay but a little dark as it was on the inside of the building. I've stayed there before and had a much lighter room on the outside and would definitely ask for one of those. It was still very stylish and comfortable with a dvd player and a nicely stocked minibar. Great bed and bed linen.So... ask for an outside room on a high floor and you should be fine. The staff were very friendly, just a bit useless at times. The room service is good but don't expect to get everything you order. The wake-up calls are unreliable so take an alarm clock.All in all I much prefer the St. Martins Lane hotel from the same group."
122,1138,"Nov 16 2004	Perfect!	Absolutely the best hotel I've ever been to!The decoration throughout is super-cool, but the staff really friendly so we felt right at home! The room (a standard one) was excellent with the legendary glass bathroom and painting on the ceiling and a reasonable size for London.The purple bar is tiny and totally candlelit with the most amazing martini menu - including chocolate ones - 8 or 9 each though so don't go mad! Breakfast out in the courtyard garden under the heaters was wonderful - we could have stayed there all day.If you love modern design and want luxury without all the usual 5-star snobbery this is the hotel for you!"
123,1138,"Nov 12 2004	What a nightmare!	I prepaid a reservation at Sanderson for 2 nights, it was $485US per night. For that amt of money, you would expect they actually would have a room for me at 7pm when I tried to check in. They did not, and they shuffled me across the street to a much less desirable location. This hotel put two authorizations on one of my credit cards (presumably for the room, which was supposedly prepaid by Sanderson) that I gave them for incidentals, for a total of $1200 credit that is still tied up. The second night the Sanderson did have a room for me, but I preordered breakfast that never arrived. I gave up and left the hotel after waiting for an hour. They did nothing to compensate me financially for the fact that they had moved me to a less desirable location the first night, and said 'sorry about the breakfast.'Lovely."
124,1138,"Oct 24 2004	Service and Staff are shocking	One of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at. Inital appreance is good but the service and staff are arrogant and self absorbed. The staff a rude the sevice shocking. They ruined our wedding nite. My wife was locked in a toilet for 20mins, during her massage they cut her eye and when we confronted the manager he response was sorry but there is nothing we can do...ha....We have started legal action against the hotel.....do yourself a favour dont book here."
125,1138,"Sep 5 2004	Saw celebs and clubbed in Soho!!	We loved it! Saw celebs and had a fabulous night. The room was small, gorgeously decorated and the shower was divine. Got a good rate and could not moan and the restaurant in the courtyard does the best ever burger and chips at a great price! The staff were rather annoying and the furniture made you feel rather uncomfortable and you felt like it was more art than sitting down but all in all we had a great stay and the location is fabulous! I agree about the Purple Room, I expected to see a load of sexy celebs all huddled up in there behind the exclusive 'I am staying therefore a member' purple curtain but it was just us and it was a Saturday night at 2am!! We had fun without anyone else to stare at but if you are paying more than 200 for the night, I would think again.....loved it for location, design, cheap food, long bar and Soho but not what I was expecting. I guess if you can afford a suite or can get a suite bargain, you may get to lord it and really appreiciate it. Our room was rather Ikea but saying that we stayed out so late we didn't really care and there was that shower.....xxx"

1,1144,"QUIET LOCATION BUT CLOSE TO LOCAL ATTRACTIONS	We expected the room to be very small after reading reviews but found our double room to be of an adequate size and very clean and modern. The reception staff were helpful but some of them did not speak overly good english. We did not eat in the hotel but could have booked breakfast for 15 each, but ate round the corner in a lovely cafe for half the price. We were dissapointed at how far away the west end was and were advised by the hotel staff that getting the bus or using the tube would involve quite a journey so therefore booked a taxi through the hotel which cost 16 there and we had to use a black cab coming back which was 26!!! The hotel was close to 2 tubes and a bus stop which took you into Oxford Street and Knightsbridge in next to no time. We walked into Bayswater for an evening meal which was only 10 minutes walk away and found there was plenty to do. We would definatley stay at this hotel again if we were going for a shopping weekend but would probably look for a hotel closer to the west end if we were going to the theatre. The only downside to the hotel was that it advertised a bar but there is not one and you can not even order a glass of wine whilst waiting for taxi etc."
2,1144,"Nov 17 2009 	Enjoyable experience	On arrival found we had been up graded to a Club Room No 103. Although not spacious it was more than adequate for our needs. Overall, the room was well decorated, very clean, with a modern bathroom. The staff were courteous and friendly. The choice at breakfast, we felt, was very good.The Bayswater Tube station is a 2 min walk away. Plenty of choice for eating out within walking distance."
3,1144,Nov 14 2009 	Not impressed	Firstly the website is a nightmare - ended up writing the address down for the Shaftesbury Hyde Park - not the Shaftesbury Hyde Park International. Ok - my own fault but very weird having 2 hotels in the same chain called such similar things.The room was dated and naff looking... The bed was comfy and everything adequate but just not great. I have stayed in similar priced hotels (by booking deals on last minute.com) which have been FAR better. Close to the tube though.
4,1144,Nov 8 2009 	Good Location	2 minutes from Bayswater tube and about 4 from Queensway. Check-in quick and curtious. Room very nice but small but what do you expect - it's London. Breakfast excellent. All staff were very polite.
5,1144,"Nov 3 2009 	NEVER AGAIN	From 29 October to 1 November 2009 I stayed in the Shaftesbury on Surrey Gardens in room 315. In over 30 years of traveling I have never been to such a hotel lacking in every area in London. Yes I have stayed in the Savoy and hotels of the same level as well as hotels where the room left you thinking you were in Karachi, from the smell and English, but than the price was not even 10% of the Savoy. My room rate for a single was 89,= pounds per night.But considering the pretensions and cost of the Shaftesbury this remains in my experience (and memory) the worst. The journey to this hotel began with the booking if you plan to arrive on the 31st of the month and depart in the following month where there are fewer days it recquires a backward attempt to make and confirm the reservation. Because I was to meet with a potential partner in a new business venture who suggested this hotel I agreed to stay there. With regards to a number of enquires to the hotel to request a room on the same floor via both e.Mail and telephone were never replied to before arrival. (We were on separate floors)Departing from the Lancaster Gate tube station I realized the map that I printed out from the web site link was for a different Shaftesbury Hotel. Upon arrival at the front desk the staff was at best indifferent. Upon arriving in my room I was in utter disbelief and shock. I have cruised on friends sailing boats of between 14 to 24 meters and I have seen larger cabins and heads (bathrooms). To get to past the narrow desk next to the bed to the bathroom recquired a careful foot placement. Any one that was overweight would be extremely hard pressed to move about in the room. Further while the room uses the credit card key system to turn on the lights the units contact was either damaged or worn out. In order to keep the lights on had to take a tissue and roll it up placing it between the key and wall so that contact was maintained and you had electrical current in your room.Downstairs I tried to explain this to the front desk but the interest was indifference. Further the manager who could deal with a complaint was only available in the early morning.After going out for the night and returning I went to bed after fidgeting with the lights. Once in bed I realized that in fact the floor was sloopping and one felt as if you were in a berth as the vessel was sailing, heeling over.In any event at 7:30 the road works commenced (they will be finished in June 2010) and after being reviving I went to have breakfast. I admit the English breakfast is not appealing to me. But even to my eye the pickings looked thin - six plates with overcooked bacon slices &amp; sausages, rubbery looking eggs and baked beans and some mushrooms. When I showed my card to the staff who could not find my name on the breakfast list they were outright rude and said that I had to get a confirmation. I explained that I was the customer and they could go up stairs and figure out the discrepancy.In any event eventualy I received some coffee, after tasting it I suspect this is why the English dislike coffee - it was warm brown tap water.Returning to the room I took a shower one must plan this carefully because of the size of the room and bathroom. The shower had a dual head and when one was finished one received and additional cold shower from the other shower head.The next day during breakfast when I had tea which occoured during a rainstorm I witness the ceiling leaking on a table. Because the eating area was in the basement it was perplexing again the staff showed they could care less. Regarding the area of Surrey Gardens Hyde Park Corner there are few reasonable places to eat beyond what one could call standard fare. There was one coffee shop just behind the hotel that provided decent coffee and a reasonable croissant.Respectfully AvHdB"
6,1144,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Location...but tiny deluxe double room !!!	The position of this hotel is absolutely great, being one street away from the Bayswater Tube as well as many supermarkets, souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes etc etc. Just great. It was walking distance to Kensington gardens and palace and hyde park.On the down side was the size of the Deluxe Double Room. We had 2 large suitcases and hand luggage and we could not fit. I have never stayed in a room that has the double bed pushed hard up against a wall ( until now ! ) and still - no space. We asked if we could upgrade to a Club room but they were all booked up.I would not stay in the deluxe room if I had known it's size. I suppose it's ok for a businessman with an overnight bag - that's a different story. Just not for tourists with luggage.However, the room was very clean, so was the bathroom and very modern.The room had tea and coffee making facilities, but no fridge. It did have an ironingboard propped up against a wall that was taking up valuable space. The TV had cable channels but there was no sound on these channels. When we asked for someone to look at it, they did but just shrugged their shoulders....OK, we are out sightseeing , anyway .We ate at nearby Kalamaris Greek Restaurant and at Bella Italian Italian Restaurant and both were good.We did not have the breakfast at the hotal and prefered to go out to a nearby cafe.The reception staff were very polite , friendly and helpful and there was free internet in the foyer."
7,1144,"Oct 6 2009 	Nice hotel good location.	I was looking for a hotel close to attractions but in a calm neighborhood. This hotel is perfect, you have 1 bus station just in front and 2 metro lines 5 minutes walking. You can easily be in Oxford street in 10 minutes. One block from the hotel there is a street full of stores, restaurants and supermarkets that Open until late at night. About the hotel, everybody was friendly and ready to help. Our room was a club room (bigger than standard) and was better than I expected, no view but very comfortable and clean. I would definitively stay here again."
8,1144,Sep 21 2009 	Excellent hotel but chaving point not working!	Tube station only abotu 100 metres away. The room was clean and modern. The shaving point had no power - I was told most rooms in the hotel don't have a working shaver point. Excellent location and excellext value for money. I skipped breakfast and got something &quot;on the hoof&quot; from local shop.
9,1144,Sep 14 2009 	Great Hotel for short stay	We stayed here for 8 days the first time and then 6 days (a week later). We found the staff to be very helpfull and proffesional.The breakfast was excellent and was included with our internet booked price.The location was 100 meters from 1 tube stop and 250 meters from another. It is only 200 meters from a bus stop and Hyde Park.The rooms were always clean (a little smaller than we were use to with 2 suitcases) but still acceptable.The staff were helpfull and willing to oblige if at all possible.Good internet access that is free.
10,1144,"Sep 8 2009 	Friendly and helpful staff great value on-line deals and a superb location!	We booked on-line and couldn't believe what a great deal we could get from a hotel in Bayswater. I made a mistake in part of my booking but the staff couldn't have been more helpful in sorting it out. The staff were incredibly efficient but not overpowering. If extras were needed they appeared within 2 minutes. The situation was perfect. We lived in London some years ago but never really explored the area like a tourist. During the day we could walk around Kensington Gardens/palace; Hyde Park; Green Park and visit so many of the attractions London is famous for. When we got tired we got on a bus or tube and used &quot;Oyster Cards&quot; to travel around (great value and you just top them up as and when you want). If you hve money remaining on the card at the end of your visit you can keep them for next time or donate to charity. In the evenings Queensway ( 2 minute walk from hotel) was thronging! The whole place was very vibrant and friendly. Shops opened until very late and so did the many restaurants which represented so many cuisines. Our favourite was a Lebanese restaurant. Delicious! The city is a lovely walk or short tube ride away. The rooms were small but had extra amenities like a microwave, a frige, and an ironing board and iron. We could have done with some information about the hotel facilities. We only found the lounge and fitness centre on our 3rd day. We had breakfast every morning ( very sustantial) but I don't think there was another dining room...we didn't need it because we had the microwave and excellent restaurants on Queensway.Considering what we paid we got a real bargain and would definitely go back there."
11,1144,"Sep 2 2009 	Very nice hotel if you can get a discounted price	I booked to stay at the Shaftesbury Hyde Park International hotel 24 hours before travelling. Because of this I was lucky enough to get a &quot;last minute&quot; price. The room I stayed in is normally 395 per night but I managed to find a deal that meant I only paid 55 for the room. I was very happy with the hotel considering I only paid 55 but I would have been very upset if I had paid full price for the same room. The hotel is in a good location being a 2 minute walk from Bayswater underground station (literally). It is very nicely decorated with modern fixtures and fittings and the staff were very friendly. Our room (412) had everything we could have wanted from air conditioning, iron and ironing board and tea and coffee making facilities. The downfall of our room however was that it was very small. This maybe due to the lift shaft being in our room! Not only did this reduce the size of the room but we could also hear the lift everytime it was used. Although it was not very loud it would easily wake a light sleeper. All-in-all I would definately stay in this hotel again although I would not pay anywhere near the normal price of 395 and I would recommend it to friends."
12,1144,"Aug 27 2009 	Pleasantly surprised - enjoyed stay	I only stayed the one night at this hotel, and had booked the deluxe double room, however when I stepped into the room, which was actually reasonably spacious, I wondered why that was. Turned out I had been upgraded and put into a club room, so I felt like I had a bargain.Room had twin beds pushed together, but that just meant more space to lie about on, TV was a nice size, with all the channels anyone really needs. Tea and coffee, with a refridgerator, microwave and cutlery were provided, and thought it a very nice touch to have a vase of fresh carnations on the desk.The reception area was lovely and clean and the smell of fresh flowers there was pleasing. The check-in/check-out was fast and efficient and staff were all very friendly and pleasant. Payment for the room was upfront, which I prefer to be honest.All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to book here again, possibly paying a little extra to stay in a club room again. I felt very much at home there.I was on the 2nd floor, and understood what some reviews say about the runble of the train, but it was very quiet and unobtrusive.The bayswater area is excellent for a variety of different shops and places to eat, and close to the tube station, so can't go wrong staying here for a weekend away for a bit of rest and relaxation."
13,1144,"Aug 20 2009 	Very Nice Experience	I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay in the centre of London. It was a couple of minutes walk from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. It was close to lots of restaurants and perfect for the London Underground as Bayswater and Queensway are both within a stones throw. The hotel itself was very modern and hasn't been open that long so in very high decorative order. The rooms are a little small but this is to be expected in London, the bathroom was perfect and the bed was very comfortable also had flat screen TV which was very nice! I would also recommend the full English breakfast which was great, the eggs had been sitting there for a bit but we asked the staff if they could cook some more which was not a problem and then had some lovely freshly cooked runny eggs. The staff were also brilliant. We ordered a cake for our arrival which was a gorgeous chocolate cake I was very happy! The only problem was that the fridge in our room was not working but they were happy to keep my cake for me in the fridge in the restaurant kitchen.I also found that the hotels own website was a better deal than any other lastminute.com type websites.We will definitely go back to the Shaftesbury Hyde Park International when we stay in London again."
14,1144,"Aug 10 2009 	Decent place but small rooms	We traveled as a group of four and got two rooms. Boy are we glad we did because the rooms we got were miniscule. There was barely enough space to walk around in the rooms. I honestly can't remember staying in a hotel with such small rooms. That said, everything in the room was just fine. The rooms had nice widescreen TVs on the wall, with comfy beds and a nice coffeemaker in the room. The bathroom had a very nice walk-in shower, which we also appreciated. There also was a mini fridge to keep cold bottled water and stuff.Location was ideal. Two tube stations were right around the corner from the hotel, and there were dozens of restaurants quite closeby, along with drug stores, markets and other crucial amenities. We thought this hotel was an ideal place to stay for people like us who mostly spent time in the city and away from the hotel. Since we mostly slept in the room, the size didn't matter that much to us."
15,1144,"Aug 3 2009 	nice experience	i think i had a nice experience with this hotel and its staff members , all were quite helpfull and polite. room was small but was adequate, facilities in room were ok.breakfast was ok i guess. i would recommend to visit again but i dont think it will be suitable for families with babies or kiddies."
16,1144,"Jul 29 2009 	Excellent!	We only stayed for one night, but the hotel is very modern and quiet. The room we stayed in was a Deluxe Double room, it was quite small but it had everything you needed. The only &quot;fault&quot; would be the odd rumble of the tube every now and then, but we werent in our room for the that as we were sight-seeing. The room and bath room was very clean. I would definately return to this hotel next time I stay over night in London. The staff were very friendly and it was a relaxed atomsphere throughout the hotel. The hotel is about 40-30 minute walk from Regent Street, but the tube is quicker, the Bayswater tube line is only over the road from the hotel, and so are a few shops and resturants, which is really convient. Also right on Hyde Parks door step!Overall, I highly recomended this hotel."
17,1144,"Jul 25 2009 	Suprisingly good hotel - we will be back!	The rooms where clean, and the staff were polite and helpfull to any requests we had. Food are often bad in Londons hotels, but not her - the breakfast are excellent, one on the best I have seen among the hotels in the Bayswater district. ( Been to ten different hotels here before.) The atmosphere in the hotel are relaxed, and the area are quiet with little disturbing traffic - though you may here the subway. I recommend you as a guest to ask for rooms in the third or fourth floor. There were fresh flowers in the rooms every day, as in the dining room and reseption. In the reseption I personally felt the flowers to be to dominating in smell, the odour was very strong - probably good in somes opionon! Over all, a very nice hotel which I can highly recommend - I will for sure live there when I go back to London! This was great!Per Georg Johansen/ Norway"
18,1144,"Jun 16 2009 	Second chance for Shaftsbury Hyde Park?	If you have read my previous review I had a terrible initial experience with this hotel. However, on 11th June after almost one month of complaining I was pleased and relieved to receive a full refund and an email apology from the hotel Manager.I am posting this review as despite my initial bad experience they have made an effort to compensate me for all the inconvenience caused.In addition the hotel have offered me a reduced nights stay in a club room with some perks, so am seriously considering giving this hotel a second chance. I shall keep you posted. I have marked as average and would recommend as although my experience has improved by response from the hotel I have not yet stayed there so cannot in all honestly give a higher rating."

20,1144,"May 28 2009 	perfect situation for exploring the capital from arrival in paddington	half-term booking thru' online booking group, might have been cheaper through the hotel's own website. Welcoming staff accommadated our luggage before we could officially book in and we went out for the day. The receptionist, manager and doorman deserve credit for their friendly and helpful manner.The rooms were small but clean and newly appointed with comfortable beds. It was very hot but airconditioning worked. I was dimly aware of the tube trains before midnight but they didn't wake me up in the morning.the hotel is situated very conveniently for the tube. we walked there from paddington but tubed back. There are a number of local shops and cafes. we took the family to a very friendly small cafe across the road from the hotel for breakfast.It is the friendliest, smartest cheap hotel I've stayed at with plenty to recommend it for convenience.If I could change anything it would be to make it cooler. The rooms were too small to spend any time in."
21,1144,"Feb 15 2009 	Double De-Luxe ....Not!!	Room in our opinion was one of the smallest we'd stayed in. Suspect it was usually used as a single. No double light over bed, only one lamp on one side. Couldn't open the wardrobe door fully because the bed was up against it! Lift was out of order so had to walk up four floors. Doesn't deserve four star status.This was only a one night stopover for us (wouldn't have liked to stay any longer)."
22,1144,"Feb 9 2009 	Good value for money	Well situated, close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. Loads of restaurants within 2mins. We were upgraded to their `club' room, which although fairly compact are very well decorated. The lift was being refurbished so we had a steep climb to the 3rd floor. Didn't stay for breakfast as the prices quoted seem pretty high. You can always get a decent full English breakfast in London for about 5 per head. We booked through laterooms.com and got a double for 65. Couple in front of us at reception paid 128...need to shop around"
23,1144,"Jan 31 2009 	Nice Cheap Hotel Good location	Booked through the Shaftesbury Hotel website and paid 59 pounds for the room with breakfast for two people. I also joined the Shaftesbury rewards program at the same time.Easy checkin, and was upgraded to a Club room for free. Was told that the hotel had undergone recent refurbishment (it did look very nice) and the lift was out of action. Nice comforatable bed, and excellent flat screen tv, although there were a few stray hairs on the floor of the bathroom.Went to breakfast late into the serving and it was a little cold, even though it was under a heat lamp. Congealed fat... not good when hung over, but good all the same, if only I was hungry. There was the typical english breakfast fare, bacon, sausages, hard on top scrambled eggs, cold ham and cheese, plus pastries and fruit juices, coffee, tea etc. Good selection considering it was included in the price of the room, but probably would have been better if we went earlierWent back to room and slept through check time, ended up checking out two hours late, but not a problem for them.Only issue, the hotel is directly above the underground tube line, meaning that sometimes you can feel the train passing underneath, not obtrusive, rather calming actually.Overall very impressed for the price and the location (only one minute from Bayswater tube station)."
24,1144,"Jan 16 2009 	great hotel	i don`t think this hotel deserves the reviews it gets from some travellers, me and my boyfriend found this hotel great and got it really cheap using booking.com. the location is super, just a few minutes from bayswater underground and near a lot of great places to eat. yes, the rooms are a bit small, but you don`t go to london to stay in your room. the lift was not working during our stay, but even though we stayed at the third floor this was not any problem. the staff is really friendly and the decor of the rooms is beautiful. we would definitely go here again."
25,1144,"Jan 9 2009	Perfect for our needs!	We booked this Hotel very last minute through Hotel Website and got a great deal, First impressions were very good - a minute from Bayswater, relaxing, calm interior reception, spotlessly clean room.we were upgraded to a club room, had our own balcony! Nice decor and a Nice small bathroom.Breakfast was very good, Although my room was on the 1st floor there was absolutely no noise from the road outside.The Reception Staff and concierge was extremely helpful.The property has the added asset of being less than Two minutes walk from Queensway and Bayswater Underground Station.Overall I found My Stay Pleasant."
26,1144,"Jan 8 2009 	looks good on the surface...	This chain is good for nice-finish fixtures and fittings such as plasma tv, clean modern bathrooms and soft furnishings - usually at a competitve price. The problem is their rooms are nearly always tiny and they obviously don't invest much in the installation and maintenance of - well anything! On a previous stay at another hotel in this chain I got locked out of my room overnight when the card-lock on my door failed (I was provided with another room but no access to my belongings until 10am the next morning!). This time everything seemed to be running smoothly (except my room being up a windy staircase on the 3rd floor and the lift not working..) until the a.m when no running water was available throughout the hotel and we were told it would not be fixed before check-out. We were provided with a taxi to another hotel to shower - but its takes all the pleasure and convenience out of staying in a hotel when you have to pack and get dressed and leave before you can even clean your teeth or flush the loo! I wrote and complained - but nobody replied..."
27,1144,"Jan 6 2009 	Crap !!!	Stayed during new year 2009 for 7 daysBooked hotel via booking.com with no problem even though still cheaper through hotel web page.This way continental breakfast only, but later confirmed with hotel full english breakfast will be served.Arrived earlier (12.00) and friendly hotel staff arranged our room aprox 45 mins later, but still earlier then check in time (14.00).Except mainly friendly staff nothing much positive could say about this hotel. Even gone for higher prize that will ensure good room, size of Club double room - unbelievable!!! Went down to reception to confirm is this single room. Unfortunately we already paid and it was New year period so not much choice remained. It can be understood size of room for London this area but 4* should be indication of overall quality and size.HOW they get it I don't know.Club double room is 2.5 x 3 m, plus toilet of some 3.5-4 sq.m .We were in room 205 that was quite compering to rooms near stairwell due to door (105, 201,etc...) Must say all new, even stylish (toilet) but miniature.Bed length very short so my legs were hanging out even I am just 1.83. Room desk as per picture - with notebook on, nothing else there.Elevator in front of door / fortunately :) out of order. Nothing in room bar for whole 6 days. Safe box inoperative and not fixed taking half of space in wardrobe.Collected dirt on ventilation at toilet even just 3 weeks since opening. On New year day no water in hotel whole morning.4 * Hotel should provide bottled water for flushing toilet at least, but nothing.Other days very poor water pressure even just on 2nd of 4 floors.Restaurant is its own story. In the basement connected by wooden (scary) stairs. Offer - Literally: 6 slices of ham, 6 slices of 1 type (cheep) cheese, scrambled eggs, mushrooms,boiled eggs, some pastry, a bit of fruit and pretty much that was it. If two or three people at same time need to wait for replenishment. Best of all, 2nd day have to warn staff that yogurts are 4 DAYS EXPIRED already.And so on,and so on. What a mistake even reception guy said we have one of best rooms in hotel. 4* ??? This should be 2 or 3 * max hotel.Coming from touristic country for sure know what I am talking. No need to say hotel screwed our vacation in London.Stay away!"
28,1144,"Dec 17 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	Pros: Very nicely decorated, plasma screen, all expected room amenities (including both British &amp; European plug sockets). Fantastic shower!Very pleasant residential location, with independent shops and bars near by. Easy reach of tube (Queensway or Bayswater) and bus links.Massively discounted rate booked online!Cons: Sash windows don't block out the noise from the street.Several hotels down the same street so expect various revellers coming home at all hours. This is not central London, although it is Zone 1 so keep in mind that a taxi ride from, say Shoreditch to the hotel will cost around 20-30. Tube is about 20 minutes to St Paul's Cathedral.Room was very small, but expected in London and the point is you go out and enjoy yourself in one of the best cities in the world.Would I recommend this to my best friend, depends on their reason for stay! I spent one night in a double room on my own, checked in at 1am which was fine. But, not sure about a longer trip shared with a partner - it might be a little cramped."
29,1144,"Dec 6 2008 	a long walk	This is the hotel at 52 - 55 inverness street and not to be confused with number 1 in the same street. The hotel is newly refurbished and comfortable although the rooms are very small - no hairdryer - TV control - and the view was out onto a cement wall.The really irritating point was that on the web it shows the nearest tube as being Paddington - it is not and in fact is at least a half mile walk.I even phoned the hotel to ask and their central reservations still insisted it was Paddington - it is not but is in fact Bayswater, less than 2 minutes out of the front of the hotel!Have a great stay!!"

1,1146,Jun 21 2009 	typical london style tiny miny rooms but good value for money..	now in 60-70 GBP range.. one cannot ask for more considering how expensive london is.. its a 5 mnts walk from the Paddington station.. there is a direct train from Heathrow to Paddington so one can take that to avoid any hassles.. its a pretty small hotel.. once on the floor where ur room is.. one has to navigate thru a labyrinth which is fun :) rooms are typical london style.. last time i was in London
2,1146,May 8 2009 	Great location nice clean room but very cramped!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April 09. We were originally booked at the sister property Shaftesbury Premier on Westbourne Terrace. But at the check in desk
3,1146,Mar 15 2009 	Great stopover	This is a secret bargain
4,1146,Jan 30 2009 	Nice enough accommodation but bad service	This hotel is fairly well situated for central london and priced reasonably given its location.The public areas of the hotel are clean and modern. The rooms are small
1,1149,Cleanliness not up to scratch	Overall stay was fine - I don't expect too much from central London. Stayed one night based on previous reviews. Room was small (expected) and quiet but extremely dark. . Decor I would describe as dated but for one night I didn't mind. Cleanliness of the bathroom though was a disappointment. Lifted the toilet seat and quite clearly it hadn't been cleaned which then made me wonder whether anything else really had been cleaned. Perhaps this is why it was so incredibly dark!
2,1149,"Nov 8 2009 	Poor Service and Terrible Hotel DO NOT STAY HERE	We arrived at the above hotel to find after almost an hour waiting in reception that they had not allocated us a room. They transferred us to their sister hotel in Paddington (not the area of London we wanted to stay) however the room we were allocated was completely unsuitable. We booked for 2 adults and a child requiring a cot however the room was accessed via 8 steps inside the rooms front door (so it was almost impossible to get our pushchair in) then the room its self had a small double bed up against 3 walls and an (extremely dirty including a used plaster stuck to it) travel cot unmade up. We tried to make this cot up however the room was too small to fit the cot in even when we moved out all movable furniture into the shower room. We contacted the manager who said this was the only room available and we &quot;should be lucky to have this&quot; as she had to &quot;call around to get this&quot; for us. By this time it was 10pm and we had gone to check in at the original hotel at 7pm. My daughter is 2years old and very tired as it was 3 hours past her bedtime. The manager gave us access to the hotel computer to find alternative accommodation but would not tell us any local hotel names outside the chain which she told us again had no other rooms. My husband tried to contact lastminute.com who we booked the room with but the phone line was closed and at this very late time in the day we could not find an alternative so we had no choice but to stay in the room offered as an alternative to the room we booked. This room was NOT suitable for us and was in no way &quot;Deluxe&quot; as it is called or a suitable alternative for the &quot;just refurbished&quot; room we had in our booking. The shower room was clean however the sink did not drain properly and their was no cold water. As their was no room for a cot and the bed was very small our daughter had to sleep on the floor. The room was very noisy both from outside as their was not adequate sound proofing/double glazing and their was also a lot of noise from other rooms, we could hear the tv of our neighbours very clearly and were woken by other guests loud arguments, swearing and door slamming. I fully realise that other guests actions are not the fault of the hotel or yourselves however this made our stay even worse. The bed linen was stained, the fridge did not work, the light smoked and smelt of burning, their was a dead bug on the desk and an alive one crawling up the wall and I think their should have been a radiator cover but instead their was a broken and rough bit of wall and wood (not very safe for my daughter or us adults either) In summary the hotel we booked had not allocated us a room, we had a long wait for a room, the alternative hotel was not in the area we wanted to stay in and its room was unsuitable, unclean and unsafe. Please don't book this hotel chain"
3,1149,"Oct 13 2009 	Clean quiet and in good location	We stayed in this hotel for one night and had booked it on the internet. We arrived early and our room wasnt ready but the receptionist was happy to give the porter our bag to keep safe. On our return we were given our room which had been upgraded to a club-room without us asking! The room was exceptionally clean and had a fridge, microwave, t.v., hairdryer, iron, ironing board and tea and coffee. The room was hot but the air-conditioning cooled it after about half an hour.The hotel is about five minutes walk from Baywater tube station and in a quiet location. If you are eating out there are many places to chose from within a couple of minutes walk such as Bella Italia, Pizza Hut, Macdonalds, Burger King, a couple of pubs and an independent Italian restaurant which is where we dined and would recommend."
4,1149,"Oct 6 2009 	Good hotel - staff is superfriendly	In some earlier reviews guests complained about noise and non-working airco and elavator.We had no complaints at all!The hotel has just been renovated and the lobby and room were nicely furnished and superclean. We had a Club Room, which is problably a little bit bigger then the others. The room was fine, and the facilities also. We got clean towels and sheets everyday.The location was very good too. Notting Hill is a niece quiet neigbourhood with 2 subway-stations near the hotel. The staff was superfriendly. They were even prepared to pick up a shopping-bag that we lost at a nearby shopping mall. They picked it up and send it to us in Holland. Is better service possible?! (thx Rosy!)"
5,1149,"Sep 22 2009 	Nice small hotel in great location	After reading previous negative reviews, I was seriously thinking about cancelling and booking into another hotel. HOWEVER, I have to honestly say I am glad I didn't. I had booked a 4 night stay in the club room with my partner. The room and bathroom were kept spotlessly clean and we even had our room serviced after not leaving the room till 2pm one day which I wasn't expecting. Decor was modern throughout the hotel.Yes, the rooms could be bigger, but for the price and prime location in Notting Hill value it was exceptional value. ( Just under 40 per night p person! ) The staff were extremely helpful. We had a room on the 3rd floor with wonderful views over the park. I would happily go back but would request the same room probably. All in all , really enjoyed the hotel and visit to London."
6,1149,"Sep 18 2009 	The worst hotel i have ever stayed in	I don't know where to start with this nightmare hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 4.15pm and were told that they could not check us in due to a break down in the computer system and was asked to wait 10 minutes. An hour later and even though the computer system was still down they offered us a room. On entering the room we found that someone was already in the room watching telly which was so embarrasing for all concerned. I was pleased we didn't have that room as it was sooooo small. We went back to reception and 10 minutes later they offered us another room and was told they had checked the room. Once in the room, we realised someone was in it as the wardrobe was full of clothes and toiletries were in the bathroom. We went back to reception and said we would go and eat whilst they sorted it out which we really didn't want to do as it was raining and we were already wet through. We returned to the hotel where we were told they would be sending us to their sister hotel round the corner. The taxi they ordered took us to the wrong hotel so we then had to walk to the right one. It was now 8pm.Once we got there we were given a room that was so small, the bed could only be accessed from one side. the telly did not work and the tubes must run right underneath the hotel so it sounded like an earthquake in the room every 2 minutes. At this point we checked out and started the 110 mile journey home. The next day we realised they had charged our account the price of the room so we phoned up to get our refund and was told that we had to put our complaint in writing and would not refund our money. What a disgrace! I understand that computers sometimes breakdown but the way they treated us was awful.It took over 4 hours to check us in and the room although clean was like being in a hamster cage and was exactly the same as the room we'd seen earlier. I hope anyone reading takes note of this and doesn't visit this dreadful hotel"
7,1149,"Aug 30 2009 	small but clean	The rooms didn't quite match the photos in the internet. They were remarkably smaller than what you might think by checking the images. Nevertheless, the rooms were very clean and pretty and the staff was friendly. There's no internet access in the hotel room (unless you have a laptop), but you can use the internet in the club room next to the lobby. The temperature in the corridors was probably about 35 degrees but there are air conditioning facilities in the rooms."
8,1149,"Aug 22 2009 	I felt like 'Alice in Wonderland'.	I booked a two night stay, paid a little extra for a deluxe double; looking for somewhere to stay on a regular basis with regularly planned visits to the capital to visit my grandson working in London. The location was good, the view over the square nice, the staff first class, BUT I was given room 101!!!It is the smallest, compact room I have ever seen in any hotel or indeed house!There was only a legs width at the bottom of the bed to get to the other side. The shower was also very tight. Was this a deluxe double??On departing and commenting the above - as well as in a subsequent letter they say: '...it's a Victorian building and they're smaller rooms...' TWADDLE Victorian rooms aren't small. They also said, when I mentioned I was looking for a regular spot that I should have said before and I could have been moved to a larger or 'club' room. WHY!! I think it was because I was a middle-aged lady - without a partner (more likely to complain), who might never come back (or say anything)Remeber...The Shaftesbury Premier London, Notting Hill, Room 101 (and I don't know whether there are other rooms where you feel like ALICE IN WONDERLAND. chf"
9,1149,Aug 2 2009 	I do not believe this is a 4 star hotel!	I stayed here with my partner for 7 nights in July 2009 and when I booked the accommodation was described as 4*Deluxe Double Room. This description was very misleading unless you happened to be a midget! We changed rooms immediately as the first room offered was in the basement and was poorly lit since the only view from the window were 2 large air conditioning ducts and the toilet seat was loose. The second room did have a large balcony (about the size of the room) and although the room and bathroom were tastefully decorated everything was on a minute scale. The wardrobe was so small that the safe (not securely fitted) was standing on its end as to have had it standing in the correct position would have prevented the wardrobe door closing. In addition an iron board and iron were placed in the wardrobe rendering it marginally better than useless.The bed was up against 3 walls so my partner had to climb over me to get in and out of bed! The shower was so small that any person of average stature or above would not be able to get in and out without touching the shower doors. We would definitely not stop in this hotel again or indeed this area of London where 90% of hotels in my opinion are inferior to the description under which they are sold.
10,1149,"Jul 14 2009 	Tiny rooms great location	I paid 75 the day before my stay on laterooms.com for a single room without breakfast in July. In addition to the price, the free internet access and proximity to the tube were also factors that encouraged me to stay at the hotel.On arrival I was asked to take a seat as the receptionist had gone to the bathroom. I was tired, hot and hungry and when I arrived at my room in the basement I began to wonder whether I should have chosen more carefully.The room was absolutely tiny and being located in the basement added to its gloomy feel. Dropping my luggage i headed out to find something to eat and was struck by how nice the street was (it was a nice sunny evening) and when I arrived at Queensway a very short walk away, how well placed the hotel was for shops and other attractions. Returning later to my room, it hadn't got any bigger, but I did notice that the quality of furnishings was good and the internet connection was great. So overall, despite the cramped room I would probably stay here again if, like this time I just had 1 night for a business trip. The location, especially in summer, when proximity to the park is an added bonus, is uplifting and makes up for the room size!"
11,1149,"Jul 1 2009 	Excellent stay with helpful staff	My wife and I stayed at this hotel 3 nights in June 2009. The rooms were clean, adequate space and free internet connection with cable in the room. Particularly important for foreign visitors was that the staff at the desk were particularly helpful in every way. We original made a four-day reservation online with a hotel reservation service. The day before our arrival we had to cancel the fourth day. The hotel reservation service (perhaps eager to extract its commission) tried to make us pay for the fourth day, but the hotel desk staff let us pay only for the three days we stayed. Location is 5 minutes walk to the underground Bayswater station."
12,1149,"Jun 5 2009 	Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome To Hell!	What a place to stay! You get a cardboard box that's too small for an average New York rat and has no window to jump out through and end the torture. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it does have something that opens into the open air, but ,with all due respect and honesty, calling that bit of plastic that opens into some sort of a dirty catacomb that entirely occupied by a bizzare and exceptionally noisy contarption is pushing the definition too far. I was in the hotel back in February as I had a job interview in London. All I was looking for was a clean and peaceful hotel, so that I could get some quality sleep. Since the heating was on full power, there was absolutely no air to breath. That in itself would not have been a big issue if it hadn't been for the nasty contraption in front of the so called window. The noise level created by that bloody thing is substantial and is fully capable of preventing a slightly stressed person from falling asleep. Air conditioner? Yes, the room had one, but it was right over the bed, just above the pillow.... From what the hotel staff told me, not all of the rooms opened into this beasty contraption. However, when I asked if it was possible to change the room, given that getting quality sleep that night was of paramount importance, I was shown 3-4 more rooms in the basement. Yes, in the basement, you heard that correctly. All of the them had the already infamous beast behind the so called windows. Seeing how they were of little improvement over my cardboard box, I decided to stay with the original. (The staff members were very nice and polite, but couldn't actually help me)And I will repeat this again, my room, as well as the others I was shown, were unacceptably tiny, even than compared to other London hotels of a similar status. Also, there was no fridge or microwave, which I though were meant to be there.On the bright side, the hotel was clean and there were no problems with the shower cabin."
13,1149,"Apr 9 2009 	awful little hotel	I don't even know where to start. First off, I don't understand how this can be a 4-star hotel. The rooms are all very tiny and cramped - even the &quot;Club&quot; rooms. Honestly, I think the only difference between the regular rooms and the club rooms is the 32&quot; TV, a microwave and a very small fridge. Not worth the extra money you pay. The hotel's website is very misleading and misrepresents itself. Also, this hotel will try to charge you for every little extra they can think of. They actually measure outgoing phone calls in something they call &quot;units&quot; which are &quot;slightly less than a minute.&quot; I mean, what is that? We also got burned in how we paid for the room. We specifically told the guy at check-in that we wanted to pay in pounds so our credit card company could determine the exchange rate we got. Instead he charged us in US dollars (at a very generous exchange rate for the hotel.) Overall, this place is a complete and total ripoff... You can find much better value if you just look around."
14,1149,"Feb 19 2009 	A fantastic hotel!	I spent a long time trawling the internet and cross referencing hotels with other reviews. Thank goodness I persevered and stumbled across this hotel. The good reviews this hotel has got a well deserved. Where people have complained, they are being very picky as although the rooms are indeed small, I have never stayed in a large London hotel room and got exactly what I expected.Myself and my partner spent 2 nights here in Feb '09 and it was very close to Bayswater tube and local amenities. I would stay here again and found the staff and location made the trip. Just think, if you don't want to stay in a small(er) room, don't stay here. If you don't mind compromising a little space, but want luxury at the same time, then this is the hotel for you!"
15,1149,"Jan 12 2009 	Great location newly renovated small room.	I was a bit apprehensive about this hotel after seeing some of the negative reviews, however the price (through the hotel website), the location (close to Paddington station for the Heathrow Express) and the fact that it was newly renovated led me to book with some confidence. On these three counts the hotel was excellent, I really liked the location, close to Notting Hill (popular for North Americans who saw the film), shops of all price ranges and the fantastic and colorful Portabello market (check out the antiques). The Hotel itself is on a quiet street, its clearly been modernised in the not too distant past and the staff were very helpful. Breakfast was hearty. The only thing that really stopped it from receiving an excellent rating was the size of the room. For London and England this room was not really small but if you are used to the large rooms normally provided for the North American market you would be somewhat disappointed."
16,1149,"Jan 5 2009 	Awfully tiny cramped room	Booked an upper floor room 3 months prior to our stay. On arrival put in basement. Complained and were moved to the 4th floor. better.. However, TINY TINY room. a rabbit hutch is bigger and we had then been downgraded from club.Fed up complaining so as were only staying 3 nights put up with it, but at 53 do not enjoy climbing over each other to get out of bed, or draw the curtains. Had to get up one at a time. The pictures on the web site bear no resemblance what so ever to the actual hotel. VERY DISPLEASED. We will not be recommending this chain of hotels to our friends."
17,1149,"Nov 16 2008 	A nice hotel	I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews about this hotel, I loved the place.Location was fab. Close to Bayswater station and local high street.Our room was cosy and clean. In the room, there was a big bed, a flat screen tv, a desk, tea and coffee facilities, a mini fridge and a microwave.The bathroom was small, but very clean.Would stay here again."
18,1149,"Nov 8 2008 	Not bad for what it is	Pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Booked through their website. For a hotel in Central London at just over 100GBP including breakfast, this is not too bad. Yes the room is small but that is what you would expect from Central London. However, it is nicely decorated and clean. We got an upgrade to a club room and there were complementary fruit, slippers and bathrobe. The bathroom had a jacuzzi and was a pretty big size (it was up a flight of stairs in sort of an attic space). It is fairly close to Notting Hill Gate, Queensway and Bayswater tube station. If you need a place to stay for a weekend in London or shopping in Notting Hill area, this is not a bad choice."
19,1149,"Oct 31 2008	Smallest Hotel Rooms in Britan	We have just returned from a short trip to London. My wife made the booking for myself and our two sons on line, at the Shaftesbury Premier London, Notting Hill. It was advertised as a four star hotel, so we were looking forward to a relaxing, time where we could enjoy the four star facilities. We arrived at 10.30pm and asked the very friendly receptionist where the lounge was located. He told us that they had no licence and were unable to provide any alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages. He apologised and told us there may be a bar around the corner a couple of hundred yards away. He told us that we had a tea making facility in our rooms. He also told us that the four star rating referred to the accommodation. The rooms allocated to us were well appointed, but were the smallest hotel rooms I have ever seen. They were the size of an average cabin on a cross channel ferry. The comfortable double bed, took up the entire width of the room, so the person sleeping on the inside had to climb over the other occupant if they wished to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. There was only enough room for one chair, so enjoying a drink while watching TV was not really practical for two people.Our overall impression was that the furniture in the rooms was very nice, but the management were offering very small single rooms as double rooms and were unfortunately charging double room prices.A four star rating implies a total package. I'm afraid the Shaftesbury Premier falls a long way short."
20,1149,"Oct 13 2008 	Little Gem	This hotel was a really pleasent surprise.... Three of us stayed in what is known as a 'quad room' which is a double room with another double room adjoined by a small staircase. The decor in both the rooms was fantastic, and both rooms had plasma tv's. The shower room was also immaculately decorated and the complimentary soaps etc were unusually good (not the usual crap you see in a London hotel!)The hotel itself was also very well decorated, with a particularly funky reception area. My only real criticism was that the self serve English breakfast was slightly cold. The cost of the quad room was less than 180 which for London is very competitive if two couples share it.Overall, a very impressive, beautifully presented hotel stay. Recommended to all."
21,1149,"Sep 16 2008	Disappointingly small room	Excellent location, facing a charming small park-square, only 5-10 minutes walk to the tube stations and lovely Hyde Park. Also very good local shopping on Queensway. Like most hotels in London the prices are a real rip-off. We had what was a &quot;clubroom&quot;, so we expected something special. The room was indeed nice but very small, only just enough room to squeeze between the double bed and the walls, and other furniture. Insufficient storage cupboard space, We stayed 6 nights, so had quite a few changes of clothes; we could not unpack properly as we very soon ran out of space to store them.Half the shallow wardrobe was filled up with an totally unnecessary ironing board, which should have been available &quot;on request&quot; only."
22,1149,"Aug 27 2008 	Lovely hotel	Stayed here for one night as we were going to Notting Hill carnival. Hotels location was perfect, only a 5 minute walk to the carnival. There are shops and bars within a 2 minute walk away. Staff at the hotel were very friendly &amp; helpful. The room was fairly small but was nicely decorated &amp; had everything we needed. The bathroom was excellent, nice big shower &amp; lots of little toiletries. The room itself had kettle, tea, coffee, biscuits, hairdryer, iron with ironing board, fridge, microwave! We stayed on a Monday evening, breakfast was served between 8 - 10am. There wasnt a huge choice at breakfast but it was ok. We had breakfast included in our rate but if you havent, pre book it the night before as it works out slightly cheaper than paying after. Would stay here again."
23,1149,"Aug 10 2008 	Worst Shaftesbury Premier EVER!!	Arrived at 9pm, they couldnt find booking on system; glad I printed the reservation confirmation. Before booking the room I had used the Shaftesbury premier hotels before so I was joined to the members club. The club offers little extras that none members do get, such as flowers and fruit in room upon arrival, free room upgrade ect. Trust me its all a lie, none if its true there is nothing free, and when it came to upgrading the receptionist suggest that two people shared a single bed. The room its self was ok but the bathroom smelt very bad, the room allocated to me was 008. Problem with this room is that it was situated right next to the aircon extractor fan. So the whole night I stayed up hearing the loud fan rattle on. By 7am I had enough went to front desk and asked to change room, thats when the receptionist suggest that two people share a single bed as they had no more double rooms. When suggest could they upgrade the room it was totally dismissed as impossibility.Over all the hotel was ok, but if you want a good night sleep make sure its not room 008 or a different hotel"
24,1149,"Jul 22 2008 	Lovely hotel	We booked this hotel for my Nan's 70th birthday and was extremely pleased with the hotel. The new refurbishment was evident with all rooms having brand new bathroom suites and flat screen televisions. Complimentary fruit and mineral water alongside the usual tea and coffee was a nice addition, and bathrobes, slippers and extra bedding is available free of charge from reception. All hotel staff were pleasant, particularly those at reception and happy to help 24hours.The location is also rather good. It is about a 5 minute walk from Bayswater tube, and a couple of minutes further to get to Queensway depending on what line you want. The hotel is situated just back from Bayswater so you have the convienience of the shops (a tesco extra, subway, fruit and veg, pubs and many others) but the area itself is nice and quiet for a good nights sleep.Others have commented on the size of the rooms, and they are small but are of quality. Besides, we only used our rooms for sleeping. The only other minor gripe is with the breakfast. We got breakfast included within our rate, however, the 12.95 price for those who haven't is totally not worth it.All in all a great hotel, newly refurbished in a lovely location."
25,1149,"Jul 21 2008 	Fantastic Hotel Good Location	Stayed in the Shaftesbury Notting Hill for 2 nights on the May Bank Holiday weekend and I have a very pleasant stay.The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and tidy; although the single rooms are quite small!The location was great, the area was quiet and the english buffet breakfast was amazing!Would definitely stay here again when I next visit London!"
26,1149,"Jul 10 2008 	good for London	This is a very good hotel for by London standards. Normally for this price you get a lot older and shabbier hotel somewhere in Paddington or Bayswater area, with tired-looking decor and indifferent staff. London hotels in general have a very bad price/quality ratio, so the Shaftesbury Premier London Notting Hill was a very welcomed surprise. The whole hotel is new, having been opened in March 2008, so everything is trendy and fashionable (the reception area even to the border of being kitsch). The hotel is in Bayswater rather than in actual Notting Hill, and both the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations are only about 10 minutes walk away. Bayswater is full of restaurants and shops, and there is a large shopping centre, Whiteleys, only 5 mins walk from the hotel. This hotel cannot help the fact that it is in an old building, so the rooms are small. We got a free upgrade into a bigger club room, which was not huge either, but quite comfortable for two. Everything in the room worked well, even thouh the signal in the flat screen TV was a bit blurred at times (maybe caused by heavy rain). The rooms are decorated with brown, gold and olive green shades, and ours was actually quite stylish. The ensuite was reasonably sized, and it had a spacious shower cubicle. As in the room, everything was new and immaculately clean. As we had one of the club rooms (404), there were little extras in the room: a fruit platter, mineral water, iron and ironing board, dressing gown and slippers as well as the normal tea/coffee facilities and toiletries in the bathroom. Everything was nicely presented. We also got 2 newspapers in the mornings, pushed under the door without waking us up.The breakfast was of average hotel buffet quality, except the coffee that was from an automat and not really good at all. Also the breakfast staff was a bit indifferent and not as friendly as the rest of the staff. However, overall the experience was very good, and this hotel offers good value, especially if you are on holiday and paying for the hotel yourself."
27,1149,"Jun 9 2008 	Small but nice	Recently renovated ,infact they are still adding the finishing touches. Reception very modern, rooms more traditional. Very nice but rooms far too small. All the rooms are small, very small. No bar in the hotel but quite a few in the area and the one just across the road is very nice and serves good pub food. The breakfast in the hotel was very nice, however, again the dining room is tiny and the tables are squashed together. A lady came to the dining room with her pram..... no chance of her getting that in there.Staff polite. Shame about the size of all the rooms. I would stay again only if it was for 1 or 2 nights."
28,1149,"May 29 2008 	Small but good quality	I think the previous reviews most certainly refer to different owners as this hotel have just had a recent refurbishment and is of good quality now.The hotel staff were really friendly throughout my stay and the hotel was clean and contemporarily decorated. The only problem with my room was it's size. The double bed was only accesible from one side and was up against the window and a wall at both ends. The bathroom was also tiny, but very nicely decorated. My room overlooked the street and a lovely communal garden.The hotel is easy to locate and only a short walk from the tube in a nice area. I would recommend it as very good quality for the price and would definitely stay there again."
29,1149,"Apr 3 2008 	Much Improved - New Owners	All reviews prior to March 14, 2008 should be disregarded as they covered the previous owners which was a Comfort Inn.The property has been completely revamped. Of course the rooms are small, but that's what you will find in London and most of Europe. A room with any floor space is going to cost you high dollar in a hotel catering mostly to wealthy Americans who are used to wide open spaces.Clean, pleasant and quite nice. Neighborhood is quiet and easy to catch a bus or a pleasant walk to the Underground. Shopping Mall two blocks away with Internet Cafe and Starbucks.I expected some problems arriving on &quot;opening day&quot; but glitches were quickly worked out.I never made it down to breakfast. Hotel is supposed to have a bar and restaurant, but it had not been opened yet. Not really a problem, as a lovely pub is just across the street. I booked a single but was rewarded with a double. I paid less than I would've paid for a room in a bed and breakfast. Hi Speed Lan internet was included.Just don't plan to host any parties in your room and expected to feel a bit confined but once you crawl into the comfy bed with the clean linens and turn out the lights, it doesn't mattter how big the room is anyway. (more than one suitcase would've been a problem -- so pack VERY light)."

1,1150,Sep 2 2009 	Shakespeare Hostel- not a good experience	Arrived to stay in this hotel for one night. Greeted by guests drinking cans of alcohol in the lounge/games area. Filthy carpets leading to the room. Arguments and loud music in the rooms next to mine. Bathroom is a modular Portakabin type. I left immediately. Hotel refused to refund the charge. Need I say more?
2,1150,"Aug 25 2009 	A pleasant stay	Good beds, good shower. Breakfast scenario quite chaotic at times. Very close to Paddington Station. Only one computer, with a pay-by-the-hour scheme. Slow internet connection. But there's an internet caf nearby."
3,1150,"Aug 3 2009 	Try somewhere else first	I didn't book this hotel on purpose. The nearby hotel that I booked had to be shut down for fire exit renovations. They automatically booked me into the Shakespeare and I didn't follow up with any of my own research and just went with it. I stayed a total of 7 nights in two different rooms. First room's advantage was that it was on the first floor. I didn't mind the small accomodations or the noise from the underground. But there was some sort of sewage ventilation problem that caused sewer gases to back up into my toilet closet. I kept the door to it closed and just dealt with it that way. Another problem with this room was the windows did not lock. Bit of a safety/security concern. After traveling around the countryside and returning to London, I again stayed at the Shakespeare for 2 nights. This time my room was on the top floor which meant dragging a heavy suitcase up 5 flights of stairs. I'm a single gal and that was pretty unforgettable. I did it though. Taught me to not do so much shopping or else not travel around the countryside. The room was more bare bones than the first one. No remote for TV either.I never ate the breakfast really. I went downstairs once for it and their idea of fresh fruit was a big bowl of canned fruit cocktail. Yuck.The front desk folks were not very helpful. Their stated check in time is noon on their website. However, if you try to check in at noon they will inform you that it is by prior arrangement only and you have to leave and comeback at 2pm. That is pretty bold.It does seem like a big party place. Not recommended for families, couples, or solo travelers. Only recommended for a bunch of kids that want to party all night. The location is convenient as it is a very short walk from Paddington Station and Underground. That is the ONLY thing this place has going for it."
4,1150,"Jul 14 2009 	65% of Reviewers Aren't Wrong.	I totally agree with the 65% of reviewers who give this hotel??? the thumbs down. Having spent two of the worst nights I've ever spent in any hotel over the weekend, I'd say to people who regard a clean room as a necessity and fancy more than three hours sleep a night, not to go there. If you're booked in already but haven't gone yet, give some serious thought to switching to another hotel. This place is not a hotel, it's a hostel, pure and simple. The only difference is that instead of a dorm for sleeping, there are individual rooms, although with all the noise at night inside this so-called hotel you'd certainly think you were in the same room as everyone else. I have two bits of advice to anyone thinking about going to London for a break, 1. Stay away from the Shakespeare Hotel, and 2. Stay away from the Shakespeare Hotel."
5,1150,"Jun 1 2009 	Not as bad	If you want a 4 star hotel, do not stay here, yes it needs some work but for the price the room is not that bad and the location is excellent, the room is clean, the bathroom has a little mold in the tile, the hotel should know that this is something chlorine will clean right away....stay here if you only going to the room to sleep....Breakfast is good for a Continental breakfast."
6,1150,"Mar 31 2009 	Not as bad as the previous reviews made it seem like it would be	We were booked into the Shakespeare by a travel agent so didn't have any choice in the matter. Having read the previous reviews, the three of us were prepared to be less than impressed. While it wasn't fancy, we did have three decent beds (a double and a single) in a clean but not fancy room. There was an attached bathroom with shower, sink, and toilet. Things were a bit threadbare but nothing dangerous or unclean. We ate breakfast in the basement restaurant - a bit plain but it fed us. The staff at the desk were quite friendly to us. Location was great - within a block of Paddington station made it easy to go wherever we wanted in the city. Not the best place I've ever stayed but certainly not the worst by any means. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for reasonable budget accommodations. There were lots of young students staying in the hotel, they were a bit loud in the evening but tolerable."
7,1150,"Dec 14 2008 	Couldn't leave fast enough	The room we stayed in was small and the furniture was threadbare. The tiny shower room (7ft x3ft) was smelly, musty and mouldy. My family stayed here only because the hotel we originally booked &quot;had water damage&quot; and booked us across the street at the Shakespeare. The desk staff were helpful in giveng directions. Breakfast was just ok. Typically for the UK, the coffee was undrinkable."
8,1150,"Nov 15 2008 	Never again!	Only select this hotel if you like mould, noise, dirt everywhere and old, damaged furniture. The staff was extremely unfriendly - some did not even speak English. This is more a youth hostel than a hotel. The guests and the tube running just behind the hotel are extremely noisy, so do not expect silent nights.The bathroom was so tiny that you couldn't even close the door behind you when you were standing in front of the washbasin. The toilet and shower were also in a very poor state.In the kitchen they have a plate on the wall: &quot;Customer says: my money pays your wages!&quot; No further comment!I liked the situation though. Paddington is not a very nice quarter, but there are a lot of nice little shops and the tube station at only 3 minutes."
9,1150,"Jan 24 2008 	Should have read the reviews :(	This was my first visit to London, actually the first trip to the European continent itself. I had heard that London was extremely expensive and tried to find a modestly priced hotel in London. I would have liked to have stayed at a chain-type of hotel like the Sheraton, etc., but could not afford it.So I picked a hotel that I thought was priced fairly and near a tube station so that I could move about the city and see some sights. I was only staying one night as I was catching a plane in the morning to another country. I thought, &quot;how bad can it be, as I am only going to SLEEP there, right?&quot;I have to say that I was disappointed. I found that their internet site raved about how good the hotel was and showed a photograph of a very nice &quot;lobby?&quot;. I don't think the lobby in the photo is actually in this hotel as I never saw it. The outside of the hotel looked extremely nice and it is in a very quaint neighbourhood, close to amenities and just around the corner from Paddington Station, which was great. There are no elevators, so I had to carry two extremely heavy bags totaling about 50kg up three flights of stairs to our room. I didn't like the idea of a shared bathroom but I thought that this was the norm in London. The bathroom was on the second floor so I had to walk to it in the middle of the night. Very bland and scary bathroom. The room itself was very bare, just two beds and an armoire-type thing that had a television. Extremely tiny room with not much room to move around in.This hotel was so nasty that on my return trip through London I chose another hotel, thinking it would have to be a better experience. Oh well, that is another review.The continental breakfast was okay, a typical english breakfast, but the dining area seemed to be located in the sub-basement, a bit of a bad location. Stay away from this hotel, I felt I was &quot;taken&quot; by the advertising on their official webpage. Obviously that is was marketing and a keen web-designer is paid to do."
10,1150,"Jan 16 2008	Free Noise at the Shakespeare	It was certainly cheap and it was certainly nasty. Of course in this part of London you will find hundreds of this type of hotel and while you may say to yourself I am only sleeping there I am not living there - if you can -don't. The location is only around the corner from Paddington tube and national rail station to be sure and there are some great staff but at the end of the day you have the circle line benath you running 24/7 and the area itself is cheap and dodgy. It is some walk to anywhere of any consequence - Hyde Park is a good 15 mins through suburbia.The breakfast included in the tariff is enough to put you off your food for a week. The flat offered is at the bottom of the hotel and all the underground trains make for a background noise you can do without. There are cooking and washing facilities but neither work well and the &quot;selfcatering&quot;options are limited due to the lack of utensils, crockeryand cutlery, pots/pans and the fact that the stove top has an on again/off again relationship with the electric ignition switch. The grill works in a fashion but the oven is verschtikt.Save a bit more and stay somewhere in Kensington. You won't regret it."
11,1150,"Dec 24 2007 	Stay Away!	Okay, so I read the previous reviews about this hotel and thought &quot;how bad can it be&quot;. Believe me it is BAD. I had asked for a single room with bathroom. My room was behind the reception area. There was a shower cubicle in the room. The toilet was in another room with a lock on the door in case anyone else tried to use it! I traveled with a friend whose room was on the third floor. Her toilet was shared with others on the floor below! The London Underground is underneath and every time a train passed, my floor was shaking. I have stayed in 2 other budget hotels before in London so I am used to low quality hotels but this is the absolute worst. The only good thing was the staff. They were friendly and always smiling. We chose this hotel due to its location. But there are plenty of other hotels in the Bayswater/Paddington area to choose from. Never again Shakespeare Hotel."
12,1150,"Jul 3 2007 	Youth Hostel not a hotel!	Myself and a friend booked this for a long weekend with our mothers. We got a pretty good rate for a &quot;family&quot; (quad) room, so were prepared for it to be basic enough - but not this bad. There were three single beds and a set of bunk beds(!) with about a foot of space between them. The &quot;en suite&quot; was not fit for use by anyone above a size 8 and was mildewy and not very clean.The windows would not stay open, the curtains had cigarette burns all over them, as did the carpet. The room was cold all the time, even though it was sweltering outside. We were on the top floor - (4th i think, not sure) - and beside what was obviously a large dorm room with about 6 students in it, who partied hard every night in their room. Complaints about the noise were met with abuse by the culprits and indifference by the management.There were only 2 towels provided and when we asked on the third night of our stay for additional towels we were given 2 hand towels and told that was all they were allowed give us.When we expressed dissatisfaction at the standard of the hotel - we were told that &quot;it is only 2 star, what did you expect?&quot;This place is no more than a (bad) youth hostel and should not even have 2 stars!! Stay away is my advice, there are much nicer small hotels (and much better hostels!) in London who will treat you better."
13,1150,"Jun 9 2007 	Old and dingy dorm-like atmosphere	Just came back from a 3-night stay at the Shakespeare Hotel last week. It was probably the worst hotel experience I've had. Our room was old, dark, dingy, and smelled musty. Bathroom ceiling had mold growing on it, tiny shower stall was mildewed. Every few minutes, the room vibrated from trains passing by. Noise compounded by loud students upstairs. We paid $150/night; unsure if hotels at that rate are in similar condition but I highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel if you can help it."
14,1150,"Apr 28 2007 	Basic hotel good location	The hotel is in a great location, -just 2 minutes walk to paddington station and a few stops the leiscter square. The area is safe, but not much going on with regards to pubs, restaurants etc. The hotel is BASIC! tiny room, holes in the floor under the carpet....you get what you pay for, but really its not the worst. however i dont think id stay there again-we had friends staying around the corner at the alexandra hotel and it was definately nicer-cleaner and brighter."
15,1150,"Oct 14 2006 	Yuk!	My partner and I booked the Shakespeare through the internet, earlier in the year for 4 nights. We arrived exhausted from the journey from Australia to find a group of young international travellers outside the hotel sitting on the steps. 'OK' I thought can handle that. When we got inside there were more young International travellers young women and men being a bit noisy (this was 11.00 pm). The young man behind the reception didn't speak very good English and looked as though he was getting stressed with all the commotion of young people around. We were given our keys and he endeavoured to tell us where our room was. We did find our room after about 5 minutes which was what seemed like in the basement. The noise of the trains was so loud our room shook. The room was grubby plus the young travellers decided to carry on until 4.00 pm in the morning. We didn't get any sleep and were completely exhausted by breakfast. Breakfast was ok but the service wasn't great. The noise in the breakfast room was just as bad as the night before. At this point my partner and I had had enough. We had booked, what we thought to be a three star hotel but this seemed to be more like a Youth Hostel. The Shakespeare is in a lovely location and so near to Paddington which is about the only thing I think it has going for it at present. We did not stay for the full 4 nights and found an excellent hotel on the opposite side of the road for a few pounds more a night than the Shakespeare charged but the difference was amazing. To be fair we were offered another room by the lady on reception and I did ask if it would be quieter which she couldn't guarantee, so what was the point in staying. Before we checked out of the Shakespeare I did check the mattress we had slept on and it was disgusting, ripped and stained not even a mattress cover. This was definately not a 3 star hotel and would probably do better to advertise as a Youth Hostel."
16,1150,"Oct 6 2006 	Cosy Shakespeare?	We spent almost two weeks in this summer in this hotel. We had a low budget and were not suprised what we got. The bed sheets were replaced only once in our 11 nights visit, but new towels were brought every day, even though we hadn`t even used the old ones yet. The room wasnt vacuumed even once during our visit. Otherwise the little room was ok. There were some quite noisy german students and the sub went straight under the hotel, trains going every five to ten minutes. It didn`t disturb us though, being so tired after whole days marches trought London... Service is good and the stuff is friendly and helpful. Safetybox didnt cost a penny."
17,1150,"Feb 18 2006	Great location noisy hotel	Stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2006 in a family room which consisted of a double and a single bed.Room had a trouser press,fridge,table,2 chairs,television and en-suite facilities.Ensuite was clean with plenty of towels and toilet paper provided.Asked for more pillows which were provided.Bedspread covers were dirty.Walls are paper thin so you will hear lots of noise from other rooms and also all floorboards creak.Continental breakfast consisted of cereal, juice,coffee/tea,toast,boiled eggs.Internet facilities available in lobby along with pool table and coke machine.Hotel reception has a safe available at no cost for guest use.Hotel location is the best thing about this place as its near Paddington Station for tube and buses...bus 15 will bring you from here as far as Tower Bridge via Oxford St, Regent St, Trafalgar Sq, St Pauls Cathedral and also back to here.Good value restaurants and pubs locally and seems to be a safe place."
18,1150,"Dec 3 2005	The only good thing is the location...	Alas, that's about it for the Shakespeare. Like the previous reviewer from Denmark, I too had no rest the first 2 nights due to the rowdy students. The next 3 were spent in different rooms but the facilities remained the problem. The rooms were too bare--no shelves for personal items even around the sink and in the shower. The toilets were too cold I had to wear my winter coat. The carpets are in such bad condition. I must say that I did not see a single bug but that's probably because the rooms were too cold.Oh let me qualify about the location. The only thing good is the proximity to Paddington and the Heathrow Express. However, the hotel itself seems to sit right above all the Underground lines. Even up on the 4th floor, you can hear every train that goes by and if you're on the ground floor, you feel the vibration as well.The staff gets an A for trying to resolve my issues but with so little to offer, the Shakespeare just failed on all fronts. You may ask why I simply did not leave? I prepaid and it was too late to cancel. I suggest you spend your hard-earned travel money elsewhere."
19,1150,"Nov 22 2005	Would rather stay in a tent	This hotel was full of very noisy pupils from Germany. This meant no rest at all during nights. We did not ask for a youth hostel but we got one. We were a family of 5 and because of no sleep we were too tired to see all the attractions in London. The walls are paper thin. You can hear every detail from next door. The floors are creaking, sounds like elephants on top of you. There are fire doors every where and they are extremely heavy and you hear them banging 100 times during day and night. Only the last night the staff could help in getting our daughter and boyfriend moved away from the school children. Just because our daughter and boyfriend are very young it does not mean that the want to stay among drunken Germans and that at full price. The bedspred was extremely dirty and there was no hot water when you wanted it and no heating before 8 pm. Just pay a little bit more and you can get a nice hotel somewhere else."
20,1150,"Jun 12 2005	Pleasant hotel nice surroundings and location	I stayed at the hotel with my wife and 3 children. It was very a very pleasant stay. The room was spacious and clean. Maybe a bit old and still well maintained. The staff was polite and helpful. Breakfast was simple but all that we needed to start the day; eggs, beans, sausage, toast, cereal, fruits, tea/cofee and milk. Only 2 minutes walk to the Paddington Station. The surroundings was reasonably quiet and very safe. Quite good choice of shops, cafes and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Extremely good value for money."
21,1150,"Jul 16 2004	exchange students experience	I stayed there 2 yeras ago while on a side trip for the exchange program and its was good for what we used it for. Its small and dingy and really kind of a crap hole in the wall but if your looking for a place that gives you an experience, stay there. We had a blast and the people who ran I though were very nice. We had breakfast every morning and then we went out to see the city. Its not bad. Not HIGH CLASS but not bad."
22,1150,"Jun 4 2004	Dorm-like atmosphere clean if threadbare	I got this hotel through London Rooms. Told them where I wanted to be and what I wanted to pay. The location is just a few blocks from Tube and Paddington Station (for 15 minute Express train to Heathrow). Staff was helpful as can be. Since there are no elevators, this can be really important if you have a heavy bag or two. Breakfast is ample but don't expect gourmet. I ended up with a double room at no extra cost as I wanted non-smoking. Shared baths (one with shower, the other WC only) were clean at all times. The nice, big tiled shower was quite welcome. The carpets were threadbare and needed replacing, but the savings were worth it, especially considering how strong the pound is to the dollar."
23,1150,"Mar 22 2004	Stay anwhere but Shakespeare!!!!	Stayed here several years ago. If you're looking for a true 16th century experience, this just might be the place. Raw sewage was leaking down the walls outside of our window. Our room absolutely reeked. Most apalling excuse for a &quot;hotel&quot; ever. There are much better places in London for the same price or even less."
24,1150,"Oct 16 2003	Enjoyed ourselves	My daughter and I stayed at the Shakespeare Hotel two years ago and were very satisfied. Granted, the rooms are small, but we had full English breakfast every morning (included in our price), internet service in the lobby, and maid service was very well done every day. We were especially pleased when, upon storing our larger luggage as we toured other locations overnight, those bags were in our room and waiting for us when we returned. The staff was very nice and got to know us by name by the time we left two weeks later."
25,1150,"Sep 10 2003	Where's the Shakespeare?	I stayed in a single room for an entire week this past summer. The rates were decent enough, and the location was excellent. It's very close to Paddington Station and the neighborhood has some excellent restaurants, a laundry facility and an internet cafe. The maid service was a bit lacking-I ran out of soap the second day and it was not replaced. The sheets and towels weren't changed often and the room was rather small. It's not bad if you're like me and don't spend a whole lot of time in the room."
26,1150,"Aug 23 2003	low quality budget hotel	We stayed in this hotel in April 2001. We had a room without bathroom, and unfortunately the shared bathrooms with showers were dirty. The window would not close, so we had a lot of noise from outside during the night. The hotel was also extremely noisy inside, so you'd better take your ear plugs. Staff were friendly. The breakfast was OK, though not impressive. The location close to Paddington Station is good. Book this hotel only if you really have a low travel budget. I would not go there again."
27,1150,"Jun 25 2003	Was not impressed you get what you pay for.	I was at this hotel several years ago in 1999. The rooms are incredibly small and so are the bathrooms. The bathrooms barely held 2 people at once. For the price and location it is decent at best but absolutely would not stay here again.The walls are paper thin and you can here everything that is going on in the room next to you, and in the hallways. We had a few problems there. When we got to our room, we had to change rooms because of the hot water not working. The room we were switched too had maybe 3 channels working on the TV. Our bed sheets were changed maybe once the whole week-my friend purposely made a lipstick mark on the bedsheets and the mark was still there several days later so they did not change the sheets. The staff (some ramdy greek guys) was helpful but I would spend more $$ next time ot stay in a nicer hotel. If you are cheap and don't care about really small, barely basic rooms, it miht work out for the thrifty traveler."

1,1151,"Very good staff	Good hotel. A bit old fashioned for my tastes but it will please many. Great service from the check in onwards. The staff couldn't be faulted. Upgraded fro 50 to a suite as it was for one night and the room and bathroom were excellent. No problems and handy for the King's Road, Sloane Street and Knightsbridge.Upmarket and safe feeling area."
2,1151,"Great	I booked this hotel via Lastminute (my normal London hotels were full). It was great, a really good bedroom and bathroom - high quality bedding, towels etc.OK the common areas were a bit tired - but the staff were friendly and the room was great."
3,1151,"Nov 16 2009 	as a hotel owner never seen such a management..	? stayed 6 nights but wished to be there only 6 min. only. when arrived hotel they gave me room where you can feel like you are in technical departmant of the hotel..even you cant see outside from windows, cause all pipes ,ventilating and heating systems were surrounded front of windows. than very difficullity moved me another room but again very small room and bathroom where paying 240 pounds that cabin. you even dont have chance to have shower in bath tube....anyway, because of the exhibition in london no chance to find another hotel, everywhere was full.everybody were mostly east europe people whom doesnt speak fluently english except concierge guy in hotel...waiters were gossiping at breakfast instead of serving...there alot to say but one guy who thinks he is manager at hotel is really very special, i never seen in my life. he has to find other job instaedof hotel bussines. will never stay again."
4,1151,"Nov 11 2009 	Great location charm and service	I was in London for a 5 night stay with my Starwood points. I chose the Sheraton Belgravia because of its location, reviews and boutique description. It did not disappoint. The neighborhood was lovely, close to Knightsbridge, Sloane Street, Chelsea and Mayfair. Reception was very low-key where I sat with the manager and checked in. My room was spacious and bright, and had a sitting area. The bathroom was large and well-appointed. The air-conditioning was exceptional. The continental breakfast was just ok, but the omelettes were superior. The breakfast area was cozy and comfortable. The staff was very accommodating from start to finish. I wanted to send some items home as I was just at the beginning of my four week trip and the manager provided a box and even had it shipped (my expense but very convenient). He also made sure I had my British newspaper of choice delivered to my room every morning in place of the one they offered. I am sad that they will be closed for renovation when I return next summer. They also may not rejoin Starwood. That part is uncertain, the way I understand it. But when they do reopen, a new and improved hotel in a great area will once again grace the streets of Belgravia."
5,1151,"Oct 29 2009 	Nice place - Too bad it will close	The place was clean and well located, although you need to walk a little bit to get to the Tube, Harrods, the Tate Britain... Our Studio Suite on a high floor (there are 10 floors) had a nice view. We did not see much of the staff but we did not need them it was fine. The place will leave the Sheraton chain after 12/31/2009, but it was still well kept when we were there.Small issues: the toilet tank took for ever to fill up, as in all London high end hotels services were not cheap (Wi-Fi, breakfast), but at least they were efficient (fast Wi-Fi and good breakfast). Also, the builiding itself is an eyesore.Overall a very good place for London."
6,1151,"Oct 15 2009 	Nice hotel...good not great	I just returned from a four night stay at the Sheraton Belgravia with my niece. I agree with others that the lobby is lovely and the welcome was very nice. Unfortunately, we had a lot of issues with our reservation and getting the correct room. First, I had booked a room with two beds since I was travelling with my 24 years old niece. I love her, but not enough to spend four nights in the same bed...Second, the day before we arrived they sent me an email asking if I wanted to upgrade to an &quot;Executive&quot; room for an extra charge. Because we were there for four nights I decided to do the upgrade.However, when we checked in, we were given a room with a king bed. I called down to the front desk and was told that housekeeping could separate the beds. The problem was that the hotel's definition of &quot;separation&quot; and mine are two very different things. They were going to &quot;separate&quot; the beds by simply putting twin sheets on the mattresses. Because there was a wall on one side of the bed, and a desk on the other, there was no way to physically move the two beds apart. It took a good 20 minutes to get them to agree to put us in an actual &quot;executive&quot; room with two beds that were literally &quot;separate&quot;. The room we ended up with was perfect so problem solved.Next issue: while we were in the lounge checking in, we saw a menu that listed &quot;American Breakfast&quot; 15 pounds. So, after getting the room sorted out we went down to get breakfast. The problem??? If you order the American Breakfast in the restaurant (which is the only place it is served before 11 a.m.) the price becomes 21 pounds!! Six pounds more for the exact same meal. That kind of thing just really annoys me. Someone needs to help me understand how the same eggs, bacon and toast dramatically changes cost from one hour to the next. I don't get it. Fortunately, our issues ended there. For the rest of the stay the service was great, the rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. Yes, the place needs updating but it was perfectlly comfortable. So, I can't give a higher rating because check in really affected the feel of the place for us. It is a wonderful neighborhood and we both walked to the tube or hopped a cab. No worries there. Would I stay there again? I probably would."
7,1151,Oct 7 2009 	good value in a nice area	good place for a business trip. Liked the fac it was close to victoria station but not too close. woudl stay there again
8,1151,"Oct 7 2009 	Wonderful surprise of a hotel in a very Posh area	I stayed here recently using a free night so I can't give you an accurate picture of the value for the price paid but was quite happy with this place. The hotel is between 2 major Tube stations but it is a bit awkward getting there by foot with luggage so if that's an issue take a taxi or a bus. I had forgotten about the desk check-in so when I entered I breezed past it and was almost at the elevators before realizing that the 2 desks to the left were for check-in and concierge. As someone was actually checking out, the concierge was kind enough to help me out. When he had trouble finding my reservation, the AGM Andrei, came over to assist me and provided outstanding service.Since I don't want everyone going there to expect the same, I won't disclose all of the perks given to me but I will say that I was upgraded on my stay and got a fabulous room in addition to a couple of other perks. Great job with the welcoming attitude and service.Room was very comfortable and bathroom had a decent shower and amenities. I didn't dine there but had a drink at the bar and a nice chat with the bartender (friendly service again).The area is behind the posh shopping area of Kensington (Harrod's etc) and in a residential neighborhood, so this may not be the place for the typical tourist. However, just up the street there is a Waitrose grocer and small cafes (Starbucks too) if you want to grab a bite to eat. Otherwise, Chelsea and King's Road is a short walk south of the hotel with lots of restaurants and shops at Sloane Square as well as the Saatchi Gallery.Definitely enjoyed my stay and would consider coming here again."
9,1151,"Oct 4 2009 	What a great hotel with such charm and character excellent staff wonderful location.	We went to London to experience Europe's history and decided we did not want to stay in a sleek modern hotel, but one that had a history of it's own. We were not disappointed. I had read some other reviews from this site about the hotel and some complained about the &quot;desk&quot; used for check in, instead of a grand counter, the tiny elevators, small bathrooms etc. and we did find that all but it was all part of the charm of this place. It is beautiful inside, it has character and we loved our stay. The staff is amazing, so helpful and friendly, you could not ask for better. The hotel is kept so clean and tidy, both the rooms and common areas. The food was excellent, we really enjoyed the lounge area with its private little nooks to sit, have a drink and unwind after a long day exploring. The neighbourhood is fantastic, lovely buildings everywhere, close to two subway lines, lots of shopping including a grocery store within minutes. We were out at a concert in the area one evening and felt very comfortable walking late at night. If we ever go back to London we will stay here again."
10,1151,"Sep 24 2009 	Very good base for a London visit	My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. It's in a very good location for tourists like us, with some excellent dining options in the area (including a great breakfast cafe just around the corner and a modern Indian restaurant - Amaya - not to be missed), and Underground stops not too far away. For a chain hotel, we found the staff very friendly and helpful; we felt individually cared for, not as anonymous pawns. Our room was lovely, large and with a terrific window seat (so when you see the odd bulges on the exterior views remember they add real value inside). We would recommend this, and we would return"
11,1151,"Sep 21 2009 	Great location terrific staff but bring earplugs	I usually stay at the Park Lane, but decided to try the Belgravia for a two-day stay during a 3-week business trip. The staff are excellent. I had an Executive Room on the 4th floor, which was a little beaten up (walls needed to be touched up) but fine, on the whole. I'm a Starwood Platinum member, and travel about half the year -- always stay in Starwood properties.My only complaint -- and it's a fairly serious one -- is that the acoustics in this building are terrible. It seems to be an old, somewhat rickety structure, but I could hear the couple next door when they spoke in a normal tone of voice -- thank goodness they were quiet people! If I was sitting in my bed, and the maid closed the door in either of the adjacent rooms, the wall behind my back vibrated. There are 1-2&quot; spaces under the doors, so it's no wonder you can hear everything in the hallway and adjacent room, if there is one.I'm on the fence about whether I would stay here again -- I love everything else about the place, but the noise was really bothersome. I know that soundproofing is very expensive (my husband is an architect and has designed two hotels) especially on older structures, so it may require waiting until the hotel undergoes a major renovation."
