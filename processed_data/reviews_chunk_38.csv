66,832,"Dec 16 2008	Internet access should be included as standard	My girlfriend and I stayed here while she was receiving treatment in a nearby hospital. While the hotel itself was quite nice, it really should have included Internet access as a standard amenity. As it is, they charge  15/day, which is rather extortionate given that one can have access at home for  10/month. I presume they are targeting business people who can claim everything on expenses, but this day and age, everybody (and certainly I) wants Internet access, and without it one can be quite disconnected from the world. If you cannot communicate with other loved ones while in the unfortunate situation of a serious hospital treatment, you're in a really bad situation."
67,832,Dec 8 2008 	Great hotel great location	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Regents Park for 5 nights in Nov with our adult children. We arrived by tube and walked to the hotel. The area was safe as we walked to and from Oxford Street several times at night. I booked a room with a disabled bathroom as I am an amputee and need to sit in the shower. Our bathroom was massive with a special seat in the bath. Our room was large but our daughters room was quite small but adequate. Breakfast was included in our rate. There was a large choice. We ate at the restaurant one night. We had a 2 course set menu for 14.50 pounds per person. Another night we had snacks at the bar which were very good value. There was a supermarket one block away and other pubs and restaurants nearby. We would definitely stay at this hotel again for location alone.
68,832,"Nov 22 2008 	Good value	I booked this hotel through lastminute.com, which sells it as a 4 star establishment. While the hotel doesn't live to its 4 star rating, location and good value for money more than make up for it. Also noteworthy are the staff, who are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are not large and feel a bit cramped, and the bathroom is also on the small side. But the beds are confortable and for a short stay its perfectly adequate."
69,832,"Oct 19 2008 	Decent hotel for brief stay	I received a free night's stay at this hotel for booking an air itinerary with British Airways. I was concerned by some of the TA reviews of the hotel. It turned out to be OK, though quite a letdown after my stay at the Hilton Islington, which has higher standards of comfort, modern amenities and housekeeping.Check-in was a pleasant surprise - no wait at all, and friendly, helpful service. My request for an upper-floor room was readily accommodated. I was assigned a room on the top (6th) floor, with a north-facing view. It would have been a pleasant view, but for the major construction project across the street, which was extremely noisy. However, this wasn't the hotel's fault, and in any case, I spent very little time in the room, so the construction noise wasn't really a bother.The hallways were narrow and a bit shabby. The room itself, while spacious enough for one, was a bit shabby too. The carpet and armchair had old stains on them, but the white bedding seemed perfectly clean. The dark furniture was a bit somber and had seen better days; the old TV had few channels and bad reception. There was storage space for an iron and ironing board, but they were nowhere in sight. The bathroom seemed well-kept, but the fixtures and tile were old, so they appeared a bit dingy. Overall, I think the housekeeping staff did a good job cleaning the room, but they didn't have great material to work with. Still, the bed was pretty comfortable and I got a decent night's sleep. The A/C worked fine, but I also used the desk fan to generate white noise, so I didn't get any unwanted noise either from within the hotel or from the street below.My free night's stay came with a free English breakfast. The breakfast room was a pleasant surprise - bright and welcoming. It was bustling with activity, but I was seated right away. The buffet was plentifully stocked and food quality was decent, though fresh fruit would have been much appreciated.Overall, the Holiday Inn was a perfectly decent place to stay for one night. If I got another free hotel night with my airfare in future, I wouldn't mind staying at this Holiday Inn again."
70,832,"Oct 17 2008 	Modern clean friendly	Booked into this hotel by my company's hotel agency; knew it was nowhere near Regent's Park! Then read some very mixed reviews, esp the most recent.Dropped hotel an email saying I was concerned; quick and friendly reply from Reservations Mgr.Arrived in the smallish, modern reception area. Immediately greeted and smiled at by concierge. Two guests being seen by two obviously pleasant receptionists. Concierge came over at once and asked me to check in at the Priority Club desk which I hadn't noticed. VERY pleasant, friendly and efficient young woman (Agnes) welcomed me and give me the plastic keycard. I guessed there was a message on screen (good!) and Agnes told me I had a very nice &quot;Executive&quot; room.Room: yes, quite small and bathroom very small with 3/4 bath. VERY clean, modern, comfortable, had everything one needs. Usual expensive minibar plus free orange juice, bottled water and KitKat (Exec rooms only?). Dressing gown and slippers (Exec room?). Otherwise nothing to distinguish an already good room as Exec. Air/con VERY good and efficient whether warming or cooling.Breakfast: Clean and bright room; Food looked good; very pleasant and welcoming manager; hot coffee very quickly delivered; quality orange juice; choice of breads and toast yourself (which I like); reasonable choice of cold food; hot food looked good so I had bacon (dried out); sausages (cooked one side, not the other - is this compulsory at hotels?); hash browns (totally dried out and inedible). Disappointing as it looked to be good quality - too much put out too soon? Easy to correct - hope they do!Very efficient, friendly and swift checkout; no bill problems. WILL go back.Someone mentioned the area; yes, bit strange for strangers but very convenient and safe; THREE Tube stations all on different lines 5-10 mins away; buses nearby; 5 taxi ride from Euston or St Pancras; not THAT far from Regents Park and about 15 mins walk to Oxford St; because quite a lot of people live in the area, some very good quality and not expensive restaurants (it's just off the main tourist beats). I went to Efes2 (just across the street) and had an excellent and very reasonable Turkish meal in a very clean and quite upmarket environment. Waiters were very friendly. TIP - look out for London cabs parked outside food outlets - always the best recommendation. Taxi drivers were picking up (proper) kebabs etc."
71,832,"Oct 2 2008 	Don't Expect Too Much	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Regents Park for free as BA was having a promotion with the purchasing of airfare from the US. We got a standard double room during the end of September/ early October. Reception was a bit brisk - like the guy wanted to get us processed asap and be done with us. He also had a very thick french accent so when asked to repeat, he seemed bothered. I'm positive that I requested a non-smoking room but Mr. Personality at the front desk wanted to argue about it saying that I didn't. We got the non-smoking room but not without a fight.Although this is rated as a 4* in UK terms, it definitely is not in US terms. As far as ammenities, it has pretty much everything you need but thats about it. If you are familiar with the Holiday Inns in the US, I'd imagine this would be pretty much the same - It is was it is.Since we had the freebie room, perhaps they put us into a smaller, non updated room. Our 6th floor (top floor) room did not look like the one in the pictures but rather a much shabbier version of one. Our room was very small (even by london standards) and seemed to have too much furniture in it. A slightly moldy smell but I'll get to that later. There was barely enough room to get around the double bed but they managed to put in a desk, 2 nightstands, 1 side table and 2 chairs. We had to move a chair and the side table to a corner of the room just to maneuver into the bed. The room was the size that if you should take a shower, it would fog up the bedroom windows located furtherst from the bathroom. We had to keep the window open as it was so stuffy in the room (and I had to get that moldy smell out) and that was the only source of ventilation. Our room was facing the street so we got plenty of road noise most of the night. Since I live in a downtown location, this was not too much of a problem for me but for those who are light sleepers - you might want to ask for an interior room.I used my UK power conversion plug but found that when I plugged in my hairdryer, it got super hot super fast and practically had flames coming out of it within seconds. I unplugged it immediately and never used it there again for charging my phone or anything else. PS: I've used this hair dryer &amp; adaptor at other UK locations with success. Luckily they had a hairdryer in the desk drawer.The carpeting in the room was beyond threadbare and I was a bit grossed out walking on it in bare feet. The bathroom was very small and had a toilet that not only didn't work half the time, but it bubbled for some time after flushing. I went to use the bathroom downstairs on the ground floor once and also noticed that they had the same plumbing problems. There was mold in the shower/tub &amp; on the bottom of the shower curtain. Water pressure was okay and the one thing that I did like was that the shower knob had a dial sort of thing with numbers so once you got the temperature you like, there was no guess work or fiddling with the dial the next time.The bed was comfortable enough. Or maybe I was numb from the jet lag &amp; overconsumption of beer/cocktails at the pubs. Didn't take advantage of the pillow menu as the ones that they had on there were fine. As far as location, it was okay. Not far from 2 tube stations. The area was not one I was familiar with but seemed okay. Lots of students from the school nearby and some shops a few blocks away.The breakfast, although quite plentiful was pretty greasy. The fried eggs looked more like they were boiled in grease as they were served nearly floating in a greasy plate under some heat lamps. Same with the bacon and the sausage. As much as I love fried food &amp; english full breakfasts, this was pretty bad.All in all, unless you get an extremely good price on this hotel (or for free in my case) I would recommend staying elsewhere."
72,832,"Oct 1 2008 	Good Hotel	I have to say I was really impressed with my stay at this hotel. Was unsure of location at first but soon realised it is 2 minutes walk to the nearest tube station - Great Portland Street. I got a relaly good rate so I was bound to be happy but the lobby is very nicely done and the rooms were very clean. I left my blackberry charger in the room and when I rung them to enquire about it, it was being held in lost property - so nice honest cleaning staff."
73,832,"Sep 26 2008 	Last Minute Secret Hotel	I stayed at the Holiday Inn, Regents Park for one night, booked as a secret hotel through lastminute but the same price as if I had booked direct with hotel!The room (560) was very compact, there is a pillow menu to choose from but delivery of pillow was done with bad grace. The room had a 4' 6&quot; bed, I had expected a king size.The bathroom was functional.The bar had run out of Port, Rose Wine, Jameson Whisky and Coffee by 2200. Friends staying on the 4th floor advised refurbishment was ongoing.The hotel was a 30 minute stroll to the West End and 15 minutes to Marleybone High Street and it's eclectic mix of shops."
74,832,"Sep 25 2008 	Bland basic rooms but good service	Stayed there on business with my wife. The first room we were given had obviously just been partly painted as had a very strong smell of paint and the woodwork had been rubbed down ready for painting in the bathroom, but had not been done. It looked like they had stopped halfway through. Also we were meant to have an executive room. Which on asking actually means the same room but they put, as someone else said a couple of bathrobes and some kit kats in the room. We asked for a change of room as smell of paint was overpowering and were switched to another room, which was a wheelchair friendly room, so was larger but not good for my wife as she has a fused spine so struggled to brush her teeth and use the sink as it was too low, Could not be bothered to ask to change again. On saying this the service generally was very good, especially at breakfast and the rooms were both spotlessly clean. However for the price I felt the rooms were no better standard than a premier lodge. Also their was a very bland cheap feeling to all the furnishings I usually stay at the Novotel St Pancras which is cheaper and far better furnished. However the service was generally much better at the Holiday Inn."
75,832,"Sep 20 2008 	Quiet and comfortable on the inside	This hotel is quiet on the inside, which is a blessing in London. The rooms are small, but functional. The staff were polite. The location is not really &quot;Regents Park&quot; in my view, but is convenient to much of the West End, either a longish walk or short taxi ride away. I didn't try the restaurant. I would stay again, for a good price, and the convenience and quietness in central London."
76,832,"Sep 10 2008 	Staff Excellent	For a very busy, chain hotel in the centre of a capital city this hotel is well above average.The staff definitely have a &quot;can do&quot; attitude and nothing was too much trouble.I have a physical disability and was asked several times by all grades of staff if I needed any assistance. This was done with genuine concern and discreetly.My room was spotlessly clean though the bathroom was a little bit tired and jaded.I phoned down for some face cloths and they were delivered within ten minutes.Our evening meal was pre-booked (a party of 12). The choice was poor - 1 meat, 1 fish, 1 vegetarian main course. All courses came pre-plated, but were hot and well presented. Again, the service was discrete and very good.The hotel was well set up for conferences.I will definitely stay here again."
77,832,"Sep 1 2008 	I've Seen Better Doss Houses	This hotel is somehow listed as a 4 star it is nothing like one. The rooms were small,dirty the air conditioning kept turning itself off, one of the lifts was not working and breakfast was at best lukewarm. The carpets in the corridors were shabby dirty and worn, it was if the company was trying to ensure we would not stay there again. They have won that one. I was due to stay in their hotel in Manchester UK but will be cancelling when I find alternative accomadation"
78,832,"Aug 13 2008 	Central location with polite and attentive staff	I stayed for along weekend to visit the Motor Show and see the Red Bull Air Race.To pay for my room I used part air miles and part cash (175 for 3 nights and 720 air miles) which seemed to get me the best rate for my air miles.I calculated against the with breakfast price on the hotel WEB site and at the time of booking each air mile was worth 42p. Most offers can be worked out to an air mile value of 6p but to get this you need hotels offering a full price and earning air miles option to calculate back to 6p per air mile. Spreadsheets are marvellous things for working out value for money!The price included full english breakfast each morning, and the bacon was fantastic!The location is perfect for a morning/evening stroll in Regents Park and only a 10 minute walk to Oxford St. I recommend if going to Oxford Street turn right out of the hotel and walk down Great Portland Street (GPS). A well respected restaurant is just down GPS called Villandry.I was checked in very quickly and had a quiet room looking onto an inner courtyard. The room was as you would expect for a 4* hotel in the UK with the only minor problem the sink basin plug did not work so the tap had to remain running to keep water in the basin when washing. The free TV channel selection is very limited but you visit London to get out and about not spend time in your room. If using the mini-bar ask them to unlock it when you check in. Face cloths are available free so no need to have a damp face cloth in your wash bag.The service in the restaurant and bar was excellent and the food was adequate.They were having problems with the lifts which if you are on a top floor might cause you problems. Check with reception, if the lifts have been fixed? otherwise; ask for a room on a lower floor.Free newspapers are available all over the hotel for you to take and read.For room supplies a TESCO Express is turn right out of the hotel and right again up towards Regents Park at the junction of Bolsover St and Euston Rd.If using this hotel as a base for sight seeing, I recommend you also use walkit.co.uk to plan your routes around the sights. Print them off before leaving home as internet charges were not cheap.This hotel is very convenient for the London Palladium being only a 10 minute walk.I recommend this hotel and will be booking again using air miles to part pay the bill."
79,832,"Aug 4 2008	Great choice!	For the New Year 2007/2008 I have spent four nights at Holiday Inn Regent's Park, which was not my first stay at this hotel.Location of the hotel is great. The crossroad between Oford Street and Regent Street (one of the main shopping areas) is just 10  15 min. walk and it is 20 min. walk from the Madame Tussauds. But, if you don't want to walk Great Portland Street underground station is just 2 min. walk. Warren Street underground station, which hes better connections, is 5min. walk.The hotel is typical London 4* hotel. In rare cases you'll get better. Reception desk staff at the hotel is efficient and wellcoming. Concierge can help you a lot with planning your stay and sightseeing. There is the cash machine (1GBPcommision) and the charging point for mobile phones in the lobby.The rooms are of medium size, which means large by London standards. They are not brand new but comfortable and clean. Beds are heavenly comfortable and are true blessing after the long day of walking. For the winter stay at the hotel, it is good to know that the central heating is very good (unlike the Holiday Inn King's Cross).The breakfast room is beautifuly and modernly decorated. I always take full English breakfast which is very good with lots of choice. I didn't eat other meals in the hotel which is understandable with the choice of restaurants in London. There are couple of acceptable restaurants close to the hotel, in Titchfield Street.I always recomand this hotel to my friends."
80,832,"Jul 19 2008	Holiday Inn Park Regent was Awesome	This was our first trip aboard from the USA. We booked the hotel and flight package through Priceline a week before we arrived July 5-11, 2008. Most of the tourist hotels were full, we found the Holiday Inn Regent Park package. I was a little apprehensive because the hotel was off the tourist tract. The hotel and location were AWESOME. The hotel was clean. Nicely decorated. Great restaurant and service. EXCELLENT service by the concierge, front desk and maid service. Great location for two tube stations that get you around central London. Pubs near by to catch a pint or dinner. Two small grocery stores very near hotel to buy fresh food. Always felt safe even walking in the evening. We found a few items missing that traditional American hotel's have, but it didn't brother us in the least. There is no microwave in the room or lobby. They had a hot water tea maker in the room that I used every morning and evening . I didn't see any ice machine or bucket either, nor a phone book in the room. The front desk was happy to loan out a phone book to us. We had an excellent stay at this hotel. And Yes the bathroom is slightly smaller than American hotel bathrooms, but it was completely adequate and actually larger than I had been scared into beleiving --- before I got there. Very clean too. The bed was comfortable for two larger than average people too. Thanks Holiday Inn Regent Park."
81,832,Jul 18 2008 	Good location and excellent staff.	We booked this hotel with Yahoo last minute deals at a great price for five nights. The rooms were nice and clean. Room service was fast and reasonably priced. I would definitely stay again. I was able to walk to so many attractions and areas w/o notice as there was much to explore and see.
82,832,"Jul 10 2008 	Nice and clean but have had better for same price	Stayed here as a free add on from a BA flight package. Third time in London in the past 4 years and felt it was nice, well located within a block of the tube but nothing special really. Have stayed in a B&amp;B and a couple of other primary Brit hotels and they were really better, if you had to pay 200. per night. It was perfectly clean, neat, good TV, air temp control in each room, a clean bathroom and room for two to get about in easily. I would stay here again if the price was right but would look at a standard Brit hotel if it were not 25% less than those."
83,832,"Jul 5 2008 	Neat clean but ripped off by the ""Exec Room""	This hotel was nice for a budget chain hotel. The room was neat and clean and it has a nice (albeit pricey) bar area and restaurant.The biggest disappointment was that we upgraded to an Executive Room and didn't get one. It turned out to be exactly the same as a normal room but with 2 free KitKats, some horrible concentrate OJ, a couple of trashy magazines (don't expect Time or The Economist) and some cheap shampoo and body wash. The room was still incredibly small, as you would expect from a normal room at a chain hotel in London, and very basic with small-ish bed, small CRT TV etc. There is nothing &quot;executive&quot; about these rooms. Had they not have mis-sold this as something it wasn't I would have felt very happy with my stay there.The other annoyance was the internet in the room didn't work and we had to go down to the ground floor to use the wireless service.A lot of effort has obviously gone into making this hotel look quite smart on the inside and we were happy and comfortable with our stay. They just need to sell the rooms for what they are and not try to cheat people into paying for something they're not really getting. It left a bitter taste."
84,832,"Jun 22 2008	quite disgusting!!!	Stayed here weekend of 21st june 08, arrived approximately 2pm on the saturday and the room was ready for us, got to the room and could hardly get through the front door as the cupboard stuck out slightly, not allowing the door to open fully. we had booked a twin room and the 2 single beds were pushed together and there was no room to seperate the beds.we checked the bathroom and it smelt vile, there was white stains over the toilet seat &amp; it was cracked, the edge of the bath was covered in mould, and the sink was leaking.Our view from our window was kind of like a prison yard!The only plus side of our stay here was the breakfast in the morning.If you are looking at staying in london maybe dont stay here unless you have a strong stomach! I would highly reccommend the hilton@ paddington, it was everything you would expect + more"
85,832,"Jun 18 2008	A toss up - 3 or 4 stars?	To give this hotel 3 or 4 starshmmMust give it 4 stars for location alone. If youre a fan of Regents Park, then youll enjoy the convenience of staying here. Although not right on the edge of the park as the name might imply, its an easy walk. And fun too if you cut through the back way in order to check out Chester Terrace. If you miss breakfast at the hotel, walk over to the Honest Sausage in the park. Free tea with certain sandwiches on Mondays. As I first walked through the door of Holiday Inn Regents Park, it made me think of a clinic  very sterile. I went to check-in at the first counter I saw but soon realized that it was actually the concierge desk. The main desk is hidden behind a wall or bank of elevators or something, so not immediately identifiable. Was greeted cheerfully and quickly assigned a non-smoking room after handing in the voucher from a British Airways deal (one free night + one night at approx. $110). The lifts and hallways also felt quite sterile and in need of updating. Or just a good cleaning and regular maintenance would probably make the difference. During my entire stay, the hallways were crowded with maids trolleys and cleaning staff ran people over in the lift without apology. They seemed unhappy, always complaining in foreign languages. The first room was on the interior, facing a prison-like courtyard. It was rather spacious  at least compared to most places Ive stayed at in London. Two single beds were pushed together to form one queen bed. Upon opening the bathroom door, I was hit in the face by a strong smell of cigarette smoke. Pulling the shower curtain back revealed mold around the tub. When I called down to explain that there must have been a misunderstanding, I was told that the room IS non-smoking. Perhaps, but maybe smoke is coming through the vents? Anyway, I was able to exchange keys for another room on a different floor. This was during the hurricanes in the UK in March and was told they had many cancellations, hence extra rooms to exchange. What a difference the new room made! It was much cosier and had more storage/closet space. There were two single beds, a comfortable lounge chair and table. Most importantly, it was smoke-free. The double-glazed windows opened up to a side street with a view of Great Portland tube station one block up and white Nash terraces in the distance. I fear this view will soon be gone as there is a large construction site next door. With earplugs, I only noticed bulldozers early one morning but then it was time to get up anyway. The morning I slept-in, the fire alarm went off. I suppose this can be expected of any large chain hotel.  The bathroom was fine, but a bit cramped with the door. The tub was not the cleanest  there was a feather or something stuck to the bottom. Despite receiving tips, it appeared that the maid never did a full clean of the room, only a quick pickup.  The breakfast room was busy and the staff cheerful. Its basically a self-serve buffet, so only expect the staff to be cleaning up or replenishing the food. At first, it was hard to figure out what they did and what you were supposed to do. They seat you and thats pretty much it. The fried eggs under the heat lamp were somewhat of a turnoff, so opted for toast (which you make yourself). I was wishing I had brought down the chocolate muffins I had purchased at the nearby Tesco. Sorry to say, but the best part of breakfast was the view of the Telecom Tower. At checkout, I left my bags with the concierge. Upon returning, I waited quite a long time at the desk before someone finally came over to help. It was mid-afternoon, so maybe they were all taking a break?? As I exited, the lobby was full of young professionals, appearing to be on interviews in a conference room. Would I stay here again? Yes and no. For a short-term stay its fine, but for an entire weeks vacation, probably not. Recommended places in the area:- The Treatment Rooms (day spa)  only one block over- Villandry  gourmet take-away and restaurant- Handy bus routes one block over on Great Portland St.- Honest Sausage inside Regents Park- Walk straight down Titchfield St. to a cluster of restaurants near Langham Court Hotel. Theres a pub to the right."
86,832,"Jun 9 2008 	I wouldn't recommend	&lt;in my previousl 4 tripadvisor hotel reviews, I gave 3 times 5 stars and 1 time 4 stars&gt;My wife and I stayed in the Holiday Inn Regent Park hotel between the 4-8/6/2008.We have encountered numerous times when we were told false information by the staff:1. we asked for a double bed room via email and got confirmation. When we got there, no double bed room was available.2. The receptionist (named Jude) told us that this is only temporary and someone will move our belonging to another room with double bed, the next morning, while we are out travelling. This was not done.3. We asked for a wakeup call at 7:30 and received it 20 minutes later. We complain and were told that the wake up list says 7:50.4. the concierge told us that all events start at 11:00 on Sundays, which is simply not true.On the other side, John, the receptionist was really nice, professional and helpful.I'm describing this as this seems like a pattern, and not a random mistake. We saw another complain earlier in the reviews and wondered about the odds that this will happen to us. Well...it just did.Besides that the hotel location is great. Only 100m from the tube, tesco and pret a manger.In addition, if you go to this hotel, 50m north to the hotel, there is a construction site. We haven't stayed in a north room, so we're not sure about the noise coming from this site, but this should also take under consideration.In addition, the hotel is very clean (so say my wife) and provide all the needed facilities - safe in the room, minibar (cost money), TV (not LCD), playstation (cost money), ok bed and shower.All in all, I wouldn't recommend going to this hotel, just because the problems we had with 3 out of 4 staff members."
87,832,"May 31 2008 	OK for a short stay	Typical &quot;dorm style&quot; European hotel, with plenty of mold in the bathtub. The location is pretty good though, 1.5 blocks from the Great Portland tube station &amp; the breakfast was excellent."
88,832,"May 29 2008 	Okay until the Fire Alarm went off!	I stayed here for 3 nights thru hotwire. I was quite happy with the choice given the good reviews here, but unfortunately my stay was less than pleasant.PROS:Location - short walk to 2 tube stations (Portland St + Regents Park), and many bus stops (on Euston Rd and on Portland Street).Clean room, has in-room safe, tea/coffee making facilities. No smell of cigarette smoke.QuietCONS:Small room. I have stayed in many Priceline 4* hotels in London before and this is the smallest room I have ever gotten. There's barely space to put my 21&quot; carryon suitcase. The bed is tiny. I booked for 1 person on hotwire, but I believe the room is also sold as a double. The bed is the size of a full, definitely not queen. I'm glad it was just me staying there as the bed would have been very cramped with 2.Horrible water pressure from the shower (my room was on the 4th floor). It was basically a slow trickle of water.My stay got worse on my second night. The fire alarm went off at 7:30am (Sunday). Other guests &amp; I went down the fire escape and found ourselves outside of the bldg and it was pouring rain out. While we were waiting, another guest said this was the second fire alarm within 3 days! We were let back inside after about 15 minutes, and there was no one from the hotel staff explaining what caused the alarm to go off.When I returned to the room to get ready for the day, I found out there was no hot water! Called the front desk and they said they're investigating it. I had to take a cold shower after all the fire alarm drama."
89,832,"May 27 2008 	OK	Booked as part of a package deal via British Airways (2 nights free including breakfast, with purchase of a flight). BA website says it is a 4 star hotel, maybe the lobby and restaurant is. The bathroom was small and in disrepair, dirty grout and semi-functional shower, marginal toilet. Bed area small but clean, though fixtures were either mostly broken and taped together or looked flimsy. Very dark near the door and closet area of the room. Room temperature control appeared to not work very effectively other than turning it off and on. In-room internet was $15/day, pretty slow at times but worked. Hotel is very convenient to the Great Portland Street tube station."
90,832,"May 20 2008 	Good For Buisness Or Leisure	I have stayed in this Holiday Inn on a number of occasions recently on business, and in this respect the hotel meets my needs very well.It is well located, being within a few minutes walk of two tube stations  Great Portland Street on the Hammersmith &amp; City Line, Circle Line and Metropolitan Line and Regents Park on the Bakerloo Line. Warren Street tube station is about a 5 minute walk which is served by the Victoria and Northern Lines respectively. Excellent choice! It is also within a ten minute walk of Oxford Street for those of you with shopping on the agenda. The hotel is in a quiet location, and I sense the area is perfectly safe; Ive never felt uncomfortable even walking back late at night. The hotel itself is fairly standard Holiday Inn fare, which means no strong plusses, but no particular minuses either. You can go there in the complete confidence that you will have a clean room and a comfortable bed for the night. The rooms themselves are on the small side, not untypical of a large city  but perfectly adequate. Effective air conditioning is provided, with the added bonus of being able to open the window if you prefer. Apart from breakfast, I have not had a meal in this hotels restaurant, but generally I do not find Dinner to be one of Holiday Inns strong suits. I have had room service meals on several occasions, and found them to be of a reasonable standard, but by no means outstanding. Room meal service is good  always quicker than they quote when you order your meal. If you want to save a bit on your bar bill, there is a Tesco Express just beside the Gt Portland St tube station where you can pick up a bottle of wine or a few beers and enjoy them with your room service meal. Breakfasts are quite good; a good choice of both cooked and the healthy option. I found staff, both waiting and reception, to be attentive although the latter seem not to be aware of the benefits enjoyed by Priority Club members; they have to be prompted. This is a consistent failing. The concierge was helpful and efficient. One gripe is this hotels irritating habit of including an optional 10% service charge on drinks you order at the bar (you have to opt out of paying it). It is one thing to be waited upon at a table, where a tip to the waiter is the norm, but to go up to the bar and be served over the counter, and then to have a tip slapped on is a bit of a cheek, particularly when the bar prices themselves are on the steep side  almost 4.00 for a pint. A cheaper option is to go and explore one of the local pubs; there are plenty around within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Overall, I find this hotel to be perfectly fine for the purpose. My instincts tell me this should be rated with 3 blobs, but for some reason, this one feels as if it deserves the fourth blob, as I almost feel this one is a slight cut above some of the others I have stayed in; I almost look forward to staying here. I certainly wouldnt hesitate in recommending this hotel, whether for a business trip or leisure."
91,832,"May 11 2008 	wonderful suprise in central london	I was stunned when I saw my room - it was far larger than any I had previous stayed in over several trips to Europe - approaching US standards. Very clean, quiet, well managed property in Marlyebone, an interesting and upcoming area of London.Staff was courteous, although I was vexed when asking for places to dine nearby, all that the person who checked me in could suggest was the hotel's restaurant. There are many excellent places within walking distance.The consierge (who was busy when I asked my dining question) was above and beyond helpful in helping me check in for my home flight online on his computer, print out a boarding pass and in booking a car for the airport.Fairly convenient to Tube and main roads. This has now become my #1 economy place to stay in London."
92,832,"Apr 21 2008 	Above average hotel...	Luckily we were able to use Holiday Inn points for our 4 night stay here because all hotels in England are very expensive! The lobby of this hotel is modern and up to date. The rooms are quite cozy, however with a little moving of side tables/desk chairs, we had enough room to live out of our two large suitcases for the stay. The bathroom is small, but they all are in London. However, it was clean and the shower worked wonderfully (good water pressure and temp). They stocked the bathroom daily with shampoo, soaps, body wash, shower caps, sewing kits and lotion.The front desk staff was friendly, however when we checked in early (as we requested) they tried to charge us 25 pounds. When we said we werent told about this, he quickly waived it for us, however it would have been a shame to get charged if we didnt put up a fight. It is 2 blocks from a tube stop and very walkable to Marleybone!"
93,832,"Apr 13 2008	Struggling to live up to expectations	This hotel isn't particularly bad, nor is it good in any notable way. A big &quot;average&quot; rating, really.It's a bit scruffy - the bathroom in particular could use some refurbishment, the fittings have lost any sense of ever gleaming. The bathroom is also very cramped, as other comments have said, which is rather uncomfortable at times. Water pressure was also very poor, giving an unsatisfactory shower.I had a room on the fifth floor, which stank of smoke - clearly this used to be the smoking floor, and they haven't been able to shift the smell yet. Avoid that floor if you can.The room is fairly small, but that is to be expected for London - most visitors aren't likely to be spending much time in their rooms anyway! There's an old CRT TV if you want it. Pillows were dreadful, though. I had five pillows, all hard and flat. Making use of the Holiday Inn &quot;pillow menu&quot; didn't help much either.The lifts are small and old. Breakfast is ok at best, a very limited selection but sufficient for most purposes.Location is pretty good, though, easy to get to many central places. Service was reasonable, although a bit slow at times.All in all, could be a lot better. Definitely not value for money. I'm unlikely to return."
94,832,"Apr 4 2008 	Nice Holiday Inn Freindly Staff	Stayed here for one Saturday night for my birthday. Had an executive room which had some nice touches but probably not worth the difference in money (we stayed on points). Rooms are small. Bathroom can only fit 1 person in at a time. Bed was a standard double which is the minimum you would expect at a hotel as beds are usually bigger than your one at home! It was comfortable though. Hotel is nice and quiet and in a good location.Staff were excellent, very friendly and efficient which is not always easy to come by these days. Id stay here again."
95,832,"Mar 25 2008 	A nice 3 star Hotel	I read all the reviews on this hotel before I booked it. After staying there the reviews were correct. This is a nice hotel, not luxurious but a good place to stay in London. We booked on priceline and got it for a good rate. The room is smaller than U.S. Holiday Inns but roomy by London's standards. the bathroom was small but efficent and the bath/shower combo was roomy. The room was clean and the hotels staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is close to central London with 2 subway station close and easy to get cabs. Ask about hiring a cab instead of using the Black cabs. the Black cabs are metered and if the traffic is bad it cost more. The cabs you hired are a flat rate and can be called and they came very quickly. I would stay at this hotel again and I recommend it as a good 3 star hotel."
96,832,"Mar 14 2008	VERY small rooms average hotel	Stayed for 3 nights.Very Very small rooms. Old tv set. Small beds.Bathroom was so small, I had to turn myself around the door towards the bath first to close the door after me. Old towels.Hotel looked clean. Nice reception. Average breakfast, everyday the same. Internet in lobby, 9 minutes for 10 pound !!!!!Ah well, average is not bad...Worst of London is Heathrow Airport !! Thats airport needs an upgrade. They cannot handle the number of planes so always delays because of that..."
97,832,"Feb 19 2008 	Ok but nothing special.	We had stayed at this hotel before, in 1997 when it was owned by another comapny and it has gone downhill. We ordered a double room but were given a twin - though to be fair the staff did re-allocate another room quickly and the staff as a whole were helpful and friendly. The room was small (but that was not a problem for us) and not terribly warm on a freezing february night. The duvet was very thin. The bathroom was horrible. The shower was ancient and the tiles cracked and dirty. The stairwells were grubby and there were used cigarette butts on the stairs (one of my pet hates) suggesting cleaning was lax. Breakast OK but over priced. Whole place was a little shabby and grubby. Location was alright but not in a very exciting area. We booked as part of a theatre package so had no choice over hotel but we wouldn't stay here again. Nothing drastically wrong but there was nothing special and it could do with a clean and general spruce up."
98,832,Feb 17 2008 	Very Average	We arrived in February for a two night stay which we booked through lastminute.com secret hotel deals. Its fair to say that the man at reception was not particularly good at speaking English which caused some initial problems. We finally got our room keys and made our way to the room. The corridors were very dated and in need of decorating but so are many other London hotels. The room itself was small but pleasant enough for what we needed and most of the amenities were there. The bathroom was below average and the shower was extremely poor. Not only was the shower head held in position with yellow insulation tape but also delivered water at the rate of a dripping nose. The view from our room was fantastic if youre a concrete fan but if not then keep the curtains firmly closed.The hotels location was reasonable and great portland street station in only a 5 minute walk away. We found the concierge to be helpful when called upon and noticed there is also an electronic concierge in the foyer. Overall this hotel was very average and we would only return if the rate was reflective of its quality.
99,832,"Feb 9 2008 	disappointing	I stayed at this hotel in January for one night. I had booked the hotel through lastminute.coms top secret hotel deals so I hadnt actualy chosen the hotel. Last minute.com decribed the hotel as being in the &quot;west end&quot; which is pushing it a bit, but thats probably not the hotels fault. I had booked a room with a double bed but when I arrived they tried to give me a room with two single beds. I was travelling alone but I hate single beds and will never book a room with single beds so naturally I complained. They did find me a room with a double bed but this room had sliding wooden screens instead of curtains and the wooden screens were broken and extremely difficult to open and close.The rooms were quite small and I actually found the room to be quite cold (which is unusual because I am usually too hot.) There was a control panel to alter the temperature but i dont think it was working properly. There was only a thin duvet cover on the bed and no blankets so I spent a somewhat uncomfortable night with a t shirt on to stay warm enough.The bathroom was extremely small. There was a shower over a bath but the bath was only 3/4 of the size of a normal bath. There wasnt room to sit on the toilet properly, you had to sit at an angle . The shower attatchment didnt work and the general decor was looking quite tired.As I had booked the room through laterooms and only paid a figure some 50 less than the rate advertised as the cheapest publicly available on the holiday inns own website, the hotel represented reasonable value for money compared to what is available in London - however - if I had paid the advertised best rate I would have been extremely disappointed."
100,832,"Jan 31 2008 	Recommended!	This hotel was nice and the people were friendly. The only issue we had was that the phone in the room was broken and did not get fixed until our last night there. The manager actually came to our room to fix the issue and he removed the charges we incurred for the room service since I had to go down to the front desk to order. The hotel was very close to the Underground (Subway Station) only 2 blocks. The rooms were clean and the breakfast buffet was pretty good as well, offering Fried or Scrambled eggs, Bacon/Ham, Fruit and many other foods. They also had Juice, Tea, coffee, milk. The concierge was very nice and helpful. The main shopping district on Oxford St. was within walking distance and many restaurants were near by. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!"
101,832,"Jan 28 2008 	I liked this hotel	First of all, let me thank all those who make their contributions on tripadvisor because I booked a single room with the Holiday Inn Regent's Park based on the previously submitted reviews I read.I had to have a stop over in London due to jet lag and I did not want to fly all night long, so I was happy to make a reservation with Holiday Inn Regent's Park.Though the room I got was rather small, it was well equipped, absolutely clean and offered me all what I needed, especially a very comfortable bed you may wish to see from my photos.Provided for free by the hotel a welcoming bottle of sparkling water was awaiting for me on the working desk, tea and coffee making facilities were at my disposal, too.I spent the evening walking along Oxford street that could be reached by walk in 15-20 minutes.These days London experienced very heavy fog, I worried about my next flight from Heathrow;the hotel concierge kindly cleared all necessary details with British Airways customer service and gave me essential information on airline schedule and transport connections and even told me that the gate in Heathrow would be changed!Check-in and checkout were very effecient. The accommodation cost  116.50 without breakfast."
102,832,"Jan 1 2008 	No room at the (Holiday) Inn!	Having booked the Holiday Inn Regents Park, London through Otel.com in July 2007, we arrived for our 3 night stay on Saturday 29 December 2007, shortly after 3pm. Reception was quiet and my wife and I were attended to promptly. Unfortunately, the Receptionost advised that the &quot;system&quot; had crashed and they were therefore unable to allocate rooms. We would have to wait for a short time or be moved to a different hotel. In the meantime we were offered a complimentary drink in the Bar. Surprisingly, there seemed little panic in the Reception area and other computers seemed to be working OK! About 10 minutes later we were seen by the same Receptionist who apologised but said that we would have to move to another hotel for one night of our three night stay. I complained that this was unacceptable and would spoil our New Year break, having to relocate on two occasions. She agreed and said that we would move for the entire stay. We were told initially that we would be moving to their sister hotel, the Holiday Inn, Bloomsbury but this was changed to the Thistle, Euston.Although extremely unhappy I agreed - we had a theatre booking for 8pm that evening and any more delays would have jeopardised that booking.The Holiday Inn orgaised a taxi and we arrived at the Thistle Euston where Reception was busy. A gentleman next to me had been moved from The Russell Hotel (another &quot;system&quot; crash I wonder?). I asked for an upgrade to compensate for our move but this was rejected and to make matters worse, despite the assurances given by Holiday Inn, Regents Park we were told that our stay was for one night only. By this time I was exasperated with the situation and the Receptionist gave me a telephone number for the Holiday Inn.I spoke with the Holiday Inn Duty Manager, Nikki, who was very apologetic and confirmed that I would have to return to them after one night. She was very courteous and professional and recognised that our weekend break was in danger of becoming a disaster. She offered us an upgrade to an Executive Room on our return and an invitation to dine at their expense the following evening. I accepted and we returned early on Sunday 30th December and found that the Receptionist, Concierge and Restaurant Manager had been fully briefed on what we were to receive. This attitude and action rescued our stay and thereafter we found the hotel to be of good value, with a small but clean room (even smaller bathroom as indicated in other reviews). Both rooms were well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was good - although no more than what I would expect in this standard of hotel.The hotel is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street (10 minutes) and Regents Park (5 minutes). It has good Tube access, with Great Portland Street underground station only 200 metres away.We enjoyed our stay very much after a difficult start but felt that the Hotel redeemed itself by its actions.A final point, if you want to see the New Years Eve fireaworks and Big Ben, get there five or six hours before midnight or else you will be herded like cattle miles away from the action - we gave up at 11pm and went back to the Hotel!"
103,832,Dec 31 2007 	Excellent location	Thumbs up for this holiday inn. Fantastic location very close to Great Portland St Tube. Room was very clean and good choice of pillows! Staff were friendly. Would definately use again.
104,832,"Dec 30 2007	Great Christmas Break	Stayed at this hotel throughout Christmas holiday 2007.Nice quiet location - easy to get around (even by foot).Rooms were spotlessly clean, with everything we required, including air conditioning, windows that actually open, adequate tv channels, fridge, and 'dream' pillows, which they pride themselves on. There was even a line in the bathroom to dry things on. Hotel staff were very polite and friendly, couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. As part of the package deal we had full board on two of the days. We were served a full Christmas dinner - tables were decorated with hats, crackers and streamers, which immediately put us in the festive mood. The starter was well presented and delicious. Sadly the turkey was second rate and of poor quality, quite tasteless, both dark and white meat in layers - seemed such a pity scrimping on cheap meat!! The evening meals left us with little choice (unlike some other Holiday Inns we have stayed in) - in fact they were quite bland and did not look very appetising. The sweet courses were about the same. On the flip side of the coin - breakfast was SUPERB, with a great choice from cereal, fruit, full-cooked, toast, rolls, etc. a mighty fine banquet!!! The bar prices are a little high - 7 for a brandy!! Found a super pub around the corner (in fact there are lots around) - so with new-found hotel friends, we enjoyed being with the locals and would definitely return next year, but on a B &amp; B basis.Overall our stay was first class for the money we paid.............Welsh Lady"
105,832,"Dec 17 2007 	Clean and Neat	Stayed on business first week in December. 10 minute walk from Warren St tube, 2 mins from Gt Portland Street. Hotel is very clean but as others have said bathrooms are small. Very quiet location one block away from Euston Road. 10 minute walk down Gt Portland Street to Oxford Street - you come out near John Lewis. Breakfast was fine."
106,832,"Dec 10 2007 	Very Good Hotel in Regents Park	I'm from DC and know hotels can be expensive, but London is ridiculous. So called 3 star hotels are extremely expensive, have cramped quarters and you basically pay for the location. The Holiday Inn Regent's park is listed as a 3 star, but after seeing other &quot;3 stars&quot; should be a 3.5-4 star. It is perfectly placed - walkable to Oxford Circus, Euston, Warren St, and Regents Park Stations. The area is much less &quot;touristy&quot; than hotels by Picadilly or Westminster. The local pubs in that area are all &quot;proper pubs&quot; and there are 5-8 within 5 blocks (our favorite being the Carpenters Arms for dinner). The twin room we had was sizable for London, was pristine in cleanliness and had a sizable clean bath with deep bath tub. The included English Breakfast is enormous buffet style with eggs, sausage, black pudding, eggs, bacon, toast, etc. There may be a wait on Saturdays and Sundays but the line moves quickly. The staff were very helpful and allowed us to keep our bags for no fee with the concierge as we arrived early. They also reserved our room so that check in later at 6pm was painless. The hotel is expensive - we paid $248/night after taxes over a December weekend, however there are rat traps out there for only $50-$100 less/night. For what you get I would recommend this hotel to a friend and stay there again."
107,832,"Dec 9 2007 	Nice hotel good location	I stayed here for 3 nights in mid-August 2007. I got a half-decent deal from airmiles. This hotel is in a quiet area about a 4/5 minute walk from Great Portland Street tube station. The hotel itself is only 'okay'. The reception staff were a bit aloof and a quite unfriendly.We also had problems because the room smelt of smoke and the only other room they had available was the same. We overheard on the chap who came to show us the other room's radio, being told to 'just spray some air freshener around' - which is not really acceptable.Also, there was only one set of towels and toiletries so I rang reception and was told somebody would bring some towels up and that &quot;there is a soap dispenser attached to the bathroom wall&quot; (said in a very standoffish tone). However, the breakfast staff were great - very friendly and helpful.Parking is available, but you do have to pay (it's London afterall), but you can get a discounted hotel rate."
108,832,"Nov 5 2007 	Consistently Delivers The Goods	We've stayed here on countless occasions through our jobs over the years and it always comes up trumps. We were relieved to find that our recent stay was on a par with other stays.The location is outstanding. You are within walking distance of some of London's most famous attractions - Oxford Street, Regent's Park, China Town, etc (Cafe PT in Wardour Street is without doubt the best Chinese restaurant in the area - you MUST try the bubble tea!!).The hotel is close to most major tube lines. If you want to avoid the crush of Oxford Street, we would recommend walking to either Great Portland Street, Goodge Street or Warren Street stations (unless you really need a line that these stations don't cover of course!).Can't comment on the food at the hotel, but there are some excellent little restaurants and cafes down the side streets in the area (I love the &quot;Ultimate Bacon Roll&quot; from Kiko's Cafe in nearby Clipstone Street!).Very clean and highly recommended."
109,832,"Nov 4 2007	Good use of space!	We booked this hotel through a 'show and stay' deal. The package offered was a good price for the location of the hotel (10 mins walk to Oxford St) but despite booking months earlier we could not have the two twin rooms as requested, only one was available (though they did throw in a two free glasses of wine by means of an apology). The rooms were 'cosy' but clean and the bathroom must have been one of the smallest I have ever seen. 'Good use of space' is probably a fair comment. Breakfast was hectic as its a large hotel and tea from a girl walking round with a thermos jug rather than a teapot, when in England, is quite poor. Nevertheless there was a good choice of food and all of it more than edible. Room service menu is worded well but the quality is nothing like it when it arrives - overpriced too.I would stay there again and probably recommend it - but not to any posh friends!"
110,832,"Oct 27 2007 	Probably my 8th Stay - And a Good Stay as Usual	I've stayed at this hotel several times when I used to work as an expat in the UK and previously on short trips to London. I'm always happy when I get this hotel because I know that the service, cleanliness, and standards at this hotel are great.Here is the breakdown:Pros--------+ Within 5 minute walking distance of major tube lines+ Clean rooms and bathrooms and sheets+ Choice of various types of pillows+ pretty good customer service+ Have all the amenities one needsCons-------- Older and dated hotel- View from Windows not spectacular- Concierge desk doesn't really know anything (they just want to book your car service and get the associated kickback)- rooms not large by American standards, but also not overly small eitherAll in all, I definitely would recommend this hotel to a friend."
111,832,"Oct 10 2007	Great location good value	I echo previous reviews about the location. The closest tube station is Portland St, but you may want to walk to Warren St station for direct trains to Victoria Station (and Gatwick Express), Buckingham Palace, Chinatown, Soho, and the London Eye. Regent's Park Station is two stops away from Picadilly Circus (theatre district).There's a bus that takes you to Oxford Circus but it often get's tied up in traffic. It may be easier to get off a stop or two before and walk. Also, to check my e-mail for free I visited the Apple Store at Oxford Circus. If you plan to make two or more trips per day by tube/bus, a day pass is economical.There's a self service laundromat on the street adjacent to the hotel.There are two food markets across the Great Portland tube station. With the miserable US dollar, a hamburger, fries and drink might set you back $8-10. A steak dinner is easily $50-75. However, I found some places to eat for reasonable prices. Pret a Manger is a sandwich chain with good selections. For less than 5 pounds ($10), I ate at Mr Wu's Chinese Buffet, Irving Street, Leicester Square, close to theatres. Of course, there are McDonald's and Burger Kings dotted all over the city.Have fun."
112,832,"Oct 5 2007 	Will stay here again	I Stayed here for 3 nights and I must say the room they gave me was very tidy and exceptionally clean. It was an inward facing room and so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The hotel is well kept and the staff all seem very friendly and accommodating. The breakfasts are superb with the food prepared in front of you and lots of it! For a central London hotel this is good value at the corporate I paid for the stay. The only thing I can say that was a negative is there was no gym or exercise facilities, but I knew that before I booked. As it is about 100mtrs from Gt Portland St underground station it has superb transport links with the rest of London"
113,832,"Sep 20 2007 	Great Stay at holiday inn regents park	We stayed at holiday inn for 3 days and had a wonderful stay.....hotel was clean and in an excellent location.....was a nice quiet street.....but only 10 mins walk to oxford street and from there easy walking distance to chinatown, soho, piccadily circus carnaby street etc. Was also only 2 minute walk to the tube for venturing further afield. Is a little cafe called Meze right beside the tube which i would recommend for a late breakfast / lunch.....very reasonable, food was fresh and clean. Found Staff to be courteous and helpful at all times. With reference to a previous comment from someone about mini bar......i removed a couple of items (when trying to find somewhere to put a pint of milk) and phoned reception told them and they said no problem.....so if you do move items by accident just let them know and you wont be charged.All in all a lovely stay."
114,832,"Sep 16 2007 	Great hotel Great location	We have just returned from a 2 night weekend stay at the Holiday Inn Regents park and it was great. The staff are really friendly, it is in a great central location that is, amazingly, still very quiet. The room we had was actually a diabled room but it was clean to a high standard (and I am fussy when it comes to cleanliness) and it was fresh and well sized. We ate in the bar on the first night and that was good and the staff were really friendly - saying hello even if they weren't serving you. There are some great touches in this hotel that are probably Holiday Inn standard but that made our stay much better such as the pillow menu. If I was staying in London I would definitely stay here again!"
115,832,"Sep 13 2007 	basic and clean not customer friendly	Stayed for 3 months on a business tip. The location is good, a minute's walk from the tube, a lot of nice restaurants and Osford Street shopping within walking distance. The hotel is basic Holiday Inn bland style, well maintained and clean. However, the hotel still maintains the old, aggravating altitude of overpricing extras, especially the 15 pounds per day charge for internet connection. In many hotels this is, as it should be, included in the basic room price (Internet connection should be considered as basic as hot water or clean sheets), but in any case this is an extremely high charge. The hotel also puts those terrible see through mini-bars in the room, which when opened automatically put charges on your bill, and in which you cannot store any personal stuff, such as a bottle of water. This anti-visitor altitude lowers the marks for this otherwise OK, albeit boring, hotel."
116,832,"Sep 2 2007 	Excellent Hotel	Excellent Hotel, the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. Check in was very pleasant and quick. The rooms were spotless and to a high standard. Yes they are not the biggest I have been in but for the location and standard it was worth it. Breakfast was lovely, You had all cooked food, pasties etc, really nice. The tube is 2 seconds away and easy travel to all the London sites. It is a five minute walk to Oxford Street and we walked instead of the tube, its nice to see the buildings on the way. This is an excellent hotel and would stay again."
117,832,"Aug 14 2007 	Bathroom Bijou but Bar prices ... 	A good Hotel in a great central location in a quiet side street St off busy Great Portland Street but within easy walking distance of Greatt Portland Street Underground station. The Hotel can look a little drab from the outside (blank walls and bare concrete) but the frontage is attractive and inside it is bright and welcoming.The room was not large (especially by US standards) but very comfortably furnished in a modern style, including some slightly odd artwork on the wall - someone seemed to have framed up the contents of a packet of biscuits ! The air conditioning was responsive and excellent. The bathroom was indeed small but perfectly adequate - I'm a guy, how long DO you spend in there - and very clean and shining brightly. The room door is opened by an electronic key card and this actually worked correctly, every time, a first in my experience ! I was impressed by the Breakfast service which was a smooth and competent operation even though the restaurant was very busy and the buffet offered a good selection of both hot and cold items, the only downside was the coffee, which was poured by table staff from a large vacuum jug (you did not get a cafetiere) and there seemed to be no easy way of getting a refill ...The Bar is comfortable and pleasant, arranged in a slightly odd semi-circular manner around the lift lobby on the first floor. The service was excellent but I thought that the prices were a little high even for central London.Checkout was efficient and trouble-free. The Concierge was happy to keep our luggage for several hours after we had checked out, and to call us a Taxi when we returned to collect it.This is an attractive and well-run Hotel in a central location, the staff were all pleasant, helpful and competent and I would recommend this as somewhere to stay in Central London.."
118,832,"Aug 11 2007 	Great Location	We booked in a here on a special offer of 2 nights for the price of one so it was great value for the location. I am not sure if I would pay the ful price as we tend to travel on a budget.The Hotel is just around the corner from Great Portland Street tube station so if you are coming Circus is 10 mins walk away and everywere is easy to get to by Tube. The area the hotel is in is nice and relaxed with small restaurants all around. Also around the corner is a Tesco Metro and a launderette if you are staying for a few days and need to wash clothes. The hotel seems to be fairly new inside, the outside is awful looking but don't let that put you off. We got a room on the 5th floor looking at the BT tower, which looks great at night lit up and is also great as a beacon for finding the hotel as it is just 2 blocks away.The rooms are very small as expected in London, but have everything you need. They could do with sliding bathroom doors instead of ones that open inwards as anyone who is on the larger side must have problems getting in the bath/shower. Maybe it's just bad design but a bath was also a bad idea, a shower cubical would have been a better use of the tiny space. The rooms are lovely and clean and the only problem I can see people haing is the size of the room. Americans will be shocked but to Brits we expect it.I would stay at this hotel again if I got a good rate again but at the full rack rate I would feel ripped off. I would say don't pay more than 130 a night we paid that for 2 nights as the second was free."
119,832,"Aug 9 2007 	Mostly good	The bad points first - the rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The selection at breakfast was not as good as some Holiday Inns and they served the (very weak) tea from a flask rather than giving me a teapot. The rest was good. Courteous staff, very good air conditioning (on the hottest day of the year), good value (80 for bed and breakfast), quiet location though near to Great Portland Street and Regent's Park tubes, clean and comfortable. Fine if you can cope with the small rooms - recommended for short stays."

122,832,"Jul 16 2007 	Highly recommended	We chose this hotel because we wanted A/C and a quiet location, as well as good access to the Tube.We read the other reviews about the hotel and we definitely agree that the rooms are small (very small closets!)and not up to Holiday Inn rooms in other countries (for example, the U.S.) but we were told to expect this in all hotels in London.BUT this is definitely the ONLY down side. The staff was superb, the cleanliness of the hotel (rooms, public areas, dining) was without a fault and we feel that choosing this hotel really helped make our stay (8 nights - 9 days) in London a success.First of all, the hotel is located in short walking distance to 3 tube stations (5-6 tube lines), and is a 10-15 minute easy walk to Oxford Street and Soho. There are many reasonably priced little restaurants in the immediate area, as well as a small supermarket, coffee shops and pubs. The area is so quiet at night that you can hear a pin drop!We came with a B + B deal and the enormous breakfast kept us full until dinner. We even ate dinner at the restaurant (There was a 20% discount on that weekend) and the food was excellent and the prices comparable to an average restaurant.This is not a cheap hotel but we felt that we definitely got value for money."
123,832,"Jul 12 2007 	Not really value for money!	Location is excellent, quiet suburb only a very short walk from Great Portland Street station. From the outside the hotel looks like it needs a make over, but inside it is clean and modern.We got off to a bad start, check-in time was 14:00 and we arrived at 14:30. Shouldn't have been a problem, but the guy at the desk(who seemed to be the manager), told us the room wouldn't be available for another 30 minutes, even though he never looked at our reservation or asked for our names. Our temperatures continued to rise as we sat in the reception area and watched other guests arrive, check-in and go to their rooms, until we decided to make our move and went to a different receptionist who sorted things out for us. The room itself was clean and well decorated, though some renovation work was underway on our floor. The twin room was very small, and one of the beds had a chair and table propped against it as there was nowhere else to put them. The bathroom wasn't big enough to swing a mouse, and you had to get right up against the toilet in order to close the door, and we're not large people. Not quite the 4* luxury we'd been led to believe!Still, this was just a room for the night as we'd come to see Genesis in Twickenham. After the concert we got back to the hotel and headed for the bar (of course). It was 00:30, the barman was polite, helpful and apologetic when he told us he couldn't take cash after 23:00. No problem, we gave him our room number! Yes problem, we decided not to give the receptionist our credit card details when we checked in, so he couldn't charge it to our room. Third time lucky, we paid by debit card. This may be standard practise in many hotels, I don't know, but what a palaver just to get a couple of ridiculously over-priced drinks!The check-out time for this hotel is 12:00 and breakfast is served to 10:00, so we weren't amused when the cleaner tried to get into our room at 08:45. This could have been most embarrasing for both parties! On a positive note the breakfast was fantastic, and as much as you could eat, and I thought the coffee was much better than in most other hotels we've used. I'm glad it was included in the price, because there's no way I would've coffed up 15 quid for it though!We stayed at this hotel because it came as a package (concert ticket and 1 night's hotel), which we bought cheaply on ebay. I phoned the hotel to see if we could stay the night before as well, and they told me it would be 160 including breakfast. Sorry, but I would not entertain the thought of paying that, and to be honest, it wouldn't have been worth it.All in all, not a bad hotel, but well over-priced............or am I from another planet?"
124,832,"Jul 8 2007	Nice Location Standard Hotel!!!	I stayed here for seven nights in early June 2007. The hotel is located in a quite residential area. Great Portland Underground is 2 mins walk, Warren Street is approx 8 mins, so there is no problem tours London via the Underground. A TESCO Express is also nearbyCheck in was smooth, I was given the key cards and was in my rooms mins latter. It was small but well furnished; the bathroom was fine but smallish a standard in London. The furniture was pretty old and signs of wear off are visible throughout the room.We had breakfast included in our rate and was fine, service was good and was replenished regularly. But would never pay 15 GBP per head for it!!!Please beware not to take a room in the second floor in which you will be hearing some noise from both their meeting rooms and the kitchens under.Oxford Street is 15 mins walk, Madam Tussauds also is within walking distant.Quit a good &quot;smallish hotel&quot;."
125,832,"Jun 27 2007 	Ripped Off	On Monday 25th June 07, we were stuck in London as there were no trains running to Scotland due to the flooding. As we are priority club members of the Holiday Inn, we decided to look for one nearby. A cab driver took us to the Holiday Inn at Bloomsbury. They were fully booked, so I asked the receptionist to contact another nearby H.I. and he phoned the H.I. at Regents Park. I spoke to someone there and she quoted 249 per night (including breakfast) but not VAT. As it was getting late and we had no wish to traipse all over looking for better deals, we accepted this. The following morning when we paid the bill, it had gone up to 269 plus vat. I queried this and was asked - do you have this quote in writing, the sorry final total was 308.10. i was also told that if I wasn't happy - to write in complaining about the price.The hotel is undergoing refurbishment - a new modern bathroom in our room - but it is so small. Modern, clean hotel and central for all tourist attractions - but the price!!!!!"
126,832,"Jun 16 2007 	A/C That works!	If you're staying in London during the summer having an A/C in the room is a huge bonus. Having one that works well is even better!The upside is this hotel is close to the underground and walkable to some of the local attractions. The downside is the rooms are small. Don't be fooled by the outside view (it looks like an enclosed multi storey car park ), as the inside is nice and welcoming including the friendly and efficient staff. Having stayed in a lot of London hotels in this price range I would give this a thumbs up.I didn't bother with breakfast as they were asking nearly 15 pounds each for it ($30 US) which I thought was a bit steep even for London. There are plenty of neighborhood grocery stores where you can pick up breakfast for a fraction of the cost."
127,832,"Jun 14 2007 	Average	Average hotel that is centrally located. Near one of the great parks in the world that is great for walking/exercising. Service is okay but the rooms are small - especially the bathroom. Fortunately I was by myself on business. TV was only free to air stations. Had just spent a night in Singapore on the way, paid less in relative terms for the room in Singapore but it was like chalk and cheese - Singapore being a great experience."
128,832,"Jun 10 2007 	Good Value	This was a great value location...close enough that one could walk to the sites if you wanted, yet not insane in price. FANTASTIC breakfast buffet. Room was solid...clean, decent...just what you'd expect from a Holiday Inn."
129,832,"May 28 2007 	Great Location nice hotel	We got a fab rate for this hotel as part of a Lastminute.com secret hotel deal, it was room only for 55 per night! The hotel was comfortable and clean, the staff were friendly and facilities were good. Our room was an ok size, but our bathroom was small, but with the price we paid I didn't care.The restaurant/bar is expensive and there is a surcharge for room service. The place is a bit of a rabbit warren, everything looking the same etc. The location is great, walking distance to Oxford Street, plus also Great Portland Street and Warren Street tube stations. We walked to Camden one day as well :)I think it is a lower four star if you know what I mean, it has good facilities and functionality but not the luxury. It feels best suited to large groups and business, but as a couple we enjoyed our stay. Have a look around for deals on this hotel and I think you'll enjoy your stay."
130,832,"May 23 2007 	A nice place to stay	We only stayed 1 night in Holiday Inn Regent's Park. I was surprised at the check in when they required to see our passports and fill in our home address, but looks like it is common practice. The room was rather small, but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was not included (because of priceline rate) and expensive, but there are 2 stores just a block from the hotel selling sandwiches, yogurts etc. Great Portland St station is very close and much more convenient Regent's Park is well within walking distance. Unfortunately, it is closed till June. The neighbourhood is quite and looks safe."
131,832,"Apr 2 2007 	Functional business hotel but quite priceyfor tourists.	I have been using this hotel as a business user for a while. Much quieter hotel (due to good double glazing as well as location) than its sister hotel in Russell Square but not quite as nice an area.Rooms are ok, bit small especially the bathrooms, not ideal for the larger user like myself. Being a loyalty card holder makes no difference here for some reason. They seem to have a problem with newspapers being taken from outside rooms as well. Staff are helpful but, as with most hotels, little recognition of guests even when long staying.Food seems reasonable if not exciting but with a variety of restaurants and coffee shops, breakfast especially is significantly cheaper and tastier outside unless incorporated in the cost of the room. A couple of small supermarkets are close as well. Nice restaurants especially around Googe Street. Internet is available but at a silly price, there is an internet cafe near by but closes at 6pm.Safes are provided in the rooms and the iron I was supplied with was clean and in good condition. TV reception was fine, limited channels and SKY One can have problems but the hotel staff fixed it quickly when I was there. Transport is good with Great Portland Street and Warren Street near by and plenty of buses to Euston and King's Cross.Regents park is only a few minutes away, nice on a summer's day."
132,832,"Mar 10 2007 	A pleasant stay	A hotel in an excellent location just two mins from Great Portland Street station and about ten minutes by tube from the West end. We were given this hotel as part of a hotel/theatre deal, and whilst I would never pay the 270 a night, the price we did pay was very reasonable. The outside is a bit grim, however inside it is very nice. The rooms are a bit larger than a standard double and the beds are very comfy. Breakfast is also very good, just watch out for the mad toaster. The bathroom does get very steamy, however all in all a very pleasnt stay."
133,832,"Feb 26 2007 	Excellent Hotel 	Stayed here for the weekend of 23rd FEB 2007. Whilst the hotel is nothing special to look at from the outside, the rooms, food and location were fantastic. Just five mins from Great Portland Street tubestation.Would stay in this hotel again."
134,832,"Feb 16 2007 	Good for the business traveler	Had a 1 night stay on business during February. The hotel seems to be particularly aimed at the business traveler with a particular emphasis on thier conference fascilities.My room and its bathroom were much smaller than similar quality hotels in London, although it was clean, comfortable and everything worked. For 1 night it was fine, any more than 1 night would not be so comfortable. I was woken at about 5am by what sounded like bin waggons. I don't know if i just happened to have the wrong room (although i was on the 5th of 6 floors) or if this would be a problem in all the rooms.I didn't eat in the restaurant but the bar did a wide selection of meals and snacks at a reasonable price, although the drinks seemed a bit pricey.The staff i came accross were all cheerful and helpful and my checking in and out were both quick and problem free.While it is not far from a tube station there is not a lot in the way of pubs and restaurants in the immediate area, although a 5 minute walk in the right direction (south down Great Portland Street) will get you to a livelier area.All in all the hotel was good for a short business trip, but i would look for something more geared to kids if i was taking my family."
135,832,"Jan 29 2007 	Good clean hotel ideally located	Despite an unpromising booking experience, my partner and I enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn, Regents Park. The hotel is ideally located, being around 300m from Gt Portland St Tube and near to all the various attractions but set in a very quiet location. The hotel is clean and functional, although it has that blandness that many businesshotels have. Staff were efficient.There are a few restaurants nearby (I can recommend the Shikara indian restaurant, excellent service and food) and the odd shop but not much else. Now to the less good points. I wasn't happy, having paid in advance, to find that I had been charged more than double the quoted amount. However, this was very quickly resolved. Neither was I mpressed by being woken at 8.30am on the morning of check out by the cleaner, despite it being obvious that we were still in situ. She came back 3 times before 9.30am although we'd asked her to leave it for an hour or so. Eventually we started to feel guilty and left!Overall, an enjoyable stay in an anonymous hotel."
136,832,"Jan 9 2007 	Great Stay	My husband and I just returned from our England experience. Spent the first half of our trip with my husband's family in Leicester City and then checked into the Holiday Inn Regent's Park in London on New Year's Eve Day. Pleasantly surprised of the size of the room, especially after reading so much on the internet forewarning Americans of the smaller statue of rooms in Europe. And a Shower! Nice! The room was very clean and neat with all we needed. Not too many TV channels but who is in Europe to watch TV, right?!The staff were always very polite and helpful, from the front desk to the concierge, to the restaurant and bar staff. They were running on a limited menu due to the holiday season, but the food was good and the lounge was a great place to sit and unwind after a day of trekking around London and seeing the sites.The location was perfect! The Regent's Park is in a mostly residential area, so it was always quiet and I felt safe walking around at anytime of the day or night, Two tube stations are very close to walk to get anywhere in London within minutesWe already look forward to returning and will mostly likely stay at the Regent's Park again."
137,832,"Dec 28 2006	Better not stay there	The hotel is located in a rather quiet area of London but the city centre is really close. Actually, that was the main reason I chose it over other hotels and it'd be quite convenient if you're looking for both relaxation and excitement (Regarding location. Easy access to many shops, the underground, restaurants etc. but not overcrowded).However, I would say that the service is absolutely awful. The staff are extremely rude and unwilling to help, plus some of them don't even speak English. They're all immigrants I suppose so they will either need you to speak slower or they won't understand you at all. The worst part is, you can even get charged for services you never asked for and the price will be anything but reasonable.It's not even up to standard so if you choose to stay, make sure you don't forget anything (they'll charge you exorbitant amounts of money, only to borrow or use some things like battery recharger, razor, Internet connection etc.) and do not ask for services like wake-up calls (they'll probably forget to call you).Overall, my experience was rather bad and I surely do not recommend the hotel to anyone. Maybe if you only want to sleep there it will be fine. But if you want some other comforts too (laundry, room service etc.) the disappointment is almost certain."
138,832,"Dec 8 2006 	OK	The location was good with lots of small restaurants nearby. It was also a short walk to two tube stations. The staff were friendly and helpful but the cost, even with a convention discount, was astonishing. I realize that the UK is very expensive but the rate seemed to be out of line with the hotel. To be fair, the hotel was fine--sticker shock. If paying my own bill, however, I would choose something more reasonable."
139,832,"Dec 4 2006 	Cleanefficient and good location	The Holiday Inn provides good quality accomodation at a reasonable price.All areas are clean and well cared for.The rooms are usual hotel size,but have everything you need.Bathroom has bath and shower over.Tea,coffee making facilities available in the room with large mugs--excellent at the end of the day.The hotel is 5 minutes from Great Portland St Station,and we purchased day tickets for the underground and travelled everywhere!Breakfast is buffet style,hot and cold and is very good.Orange juice is even freshly squeezed.All staff are polite and well trained.Overall,a good base for a week-end stay."
140,832,"Nov 13 2006 	Nice hotel and nice location	Stayed here for one week in July 2004. The hotel was nice and the staff were pleasant. The location was close to the tube station (about 1-2 minute walk from the hotel lobby). The hotel was in a quiet location, but within walking distance to busier spots. I really liked this spot and got a great price through travelocity.com's last minute packages. When I went back to London in December 2004 I was going to reserve this hotel again, but I found a better price somewhere else. Overall I would say it's a nice basic hotel. Our room had its own private bathroom."
141,832,"Nov 11 2006 	Very Disappointing	On line pricing very deceptive, started off at 135, but by the time I added breakfast and then they added VAT at end - cost over 170. Because I was staying with someone else there, had to pick this hotel, so at price, was hoping for something nicer. Concierge very friendly and helpful, reception impressive. Room was cold, yet it was quite mild outside for October. Mould in bathroom, furniture patched up with different wood, general decor in room and corridors etc very shabby. Hated the tube of hair and body shampoo bolted to wall in bathroom (used my own so it wasn't problem but expected more). Ate in bar that night, service slow, food cold by time we got it and asked for steak (in sandwich) to be extremely well cooked - cremated in fact - couldn't eat it because it was pink. Next morning at breakfast, restaurant manager telling staff off in front of guests and tried to get one guest to move half way through her breakfast. Filled in survey, but nobody got back to me."
142,832,"Sep 12 2006 	Quite nice - for a Holiday Inn	Holiday Inn's have a bit of a reputation as being cheap and cheerful. The perfect place for your average Joe to stay at for a few nights relatively cheaply. Well my name is not Joe and I wanted more. Still the sales promotion of the hotel was offering more so I gave it a go.The hotel was relatively easy to find. It is down King's Cross road. It was a bit of a further walk from the King's Cross tube station that I was expecting, fortuantely I didn't have too much luggage with me. On Entering the hotel it seemed clean, welcoming and rather nice inside. The reception desk was right at the front entrance of the hotel. Booking in was trouble free. The reception desk was busy but it took no time at all to get to my turn in the queue due to diligent reception staff. All details of my booking were correct. I was given directions to the lifts and to my room. On entering my room I realised it was quite a large room (double bed, single occupancy). It was clean and tidy and well presented.On closer inspection of some of the furniture you could see it was a bit cheap and nasty. After a while of looking round the room I realised that I did not have my TV remote. I went down to reception to ask for a new remote. They were quick to get me a new remote delivered to my room. The food at the hotel was rather nice and served with a smile and to the way that I wanted it.The location is not so great. King's Cross is not the best location in London. I know it is not the worst place in Central London and that it is improving but it is still not the greatest of places to stay.The price of the room was very well priced (I know it is a Holiday Inn but the price was still good).Conclusionso - Staff helpfulo - Cheap but reasonably good qualityo - Large rooms - big bang for the bucko - Food pretty goodo - Location a bit shabbyo - Quite a walk from the nearest tube station but not too bad."
143,832,"Sep 11 2006 	Excellent Value and Location	We just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel. I booked through the British Airways Holidays website and got an excellent rate, including full breakfast. I decided to book, based on the generally good reviews here on TA.I was not disappointed at all. The hotel itself is very nice, with a modern and comfortable reception area/Lobby. The room was small, but perfectly fine. It had a chair with reading lamp, a desk and a dresser. The bathroom was very tiny, but perfectly fine to use. The shower was great, with lots of hot water and good pressure. The restaurant was very pleasant and the full English breakfast was quite good. There was a large variety of food, including eggs, sausages, kippers, bacon, cereal, pastries, juices, etc.The location of the hotel is excellent, on a quiet street, about 10 minutes' walk from Oxford St. and 1 minute walk to a Tube station. Also, if you are coming from Heathrow, it's only a short 6 GPB taxi ride from Paddington, if you use the Heathrow Express. On Cleveland St., one block over, is a group of wonderful restaurants of all kinds for dinner.We had a problem with the lights not working in our room when we arrived, but the front desk was very efficient and pleasant, and moved us quickly to a new room without any fuss. All the staff were extremely professional and courteous and helpful. The two reasons I didn't give it five stars were the tiny bathroom, and the fact that 2 of three elevators were not working during most of our stay, and we ended up taking the stairs to our third floor room when we didn't want to wait.Overall, this hotel seems to avoid most of the problems I've read here on TA with budget hotels in London. It's clean, modern, Air Conditioned and reasonably-priced. I will most likely book here again when I return to London."
144,832,"Aug 15 2006 	Great location in quiet neighbourhood	Stayed here during the July heatwave  warm in the corridors but air condition coped admirably in rooms. Very friendly receptionists, good breakfasts and decent service from the waiters/waitresses.Room could have been slightly larger, but was clean and tidy with good shower and plenty of hot water.I would recommend this hotel for its convenience to the city centre and also for relaxing in Regent's Park. Doesn't suffer from continual traffic noise even with the windows open due to the fact it situated down a side street near Fitzroy Square.Several decent restaurants nearby (turn left out of reception) and into Cleveland Street where there is a great Italian and a good fish and chip shop. Another few minutes takes you into Charlotte Street where there are several restaurants to suit all pockets.From there Oxford Street is only minutes away.One word of warning both Regent's Park and Great Portland Street Underground stations are closed at the moment so use Warren Street which is only 10 minutes away.This is the third or fourth time we've stayed here and never been disappointed."
145,832,"Jul 15 2006	Okay Not great. Expected more	Frankly, I expected more from this hotel based on the prior reviews. The location is relatively accessible, but be aware that it is not near any of the attractions. Even Madame Tussaud's is a long walk. It is located relatively close to two metro stations, but neither of these lines really goes close to the usual tourist sights, so you need to change at Piccadilly or Leicester. We ended up taking an on-off bus tour, but this was a bit difficult as traffic and road construction meant it took a very long time to get anywhere.The rooms were VERY small. I booked a triple for myself and two children ages 9 and 13. The room was a shoebox, barely big enough for the queen size bed and cot they added to the room. I expected a true triple room when I booked, as these are quite common in Europe (we got a triple in Paris, no problem). When I inquired about the availability of a larger room, I was told that all rooms are the same size. (This apparently is true, as my mother's room was a similarly sized shoe box). The bath was also very small. On a positive note, the rooms were very clean and the air conditioning and plumbing worked well. The concierge staff were very nice and helpful. There were many good restaurants in walking distance. Breakfasts were very fullsome, with the typical english eggs, sausage, fruit and toast. The internet service in the lobby worked well, although I was surprised that I had to pay for it. For my money, I'd stay in a better location, as the rooms couldnt' be any smaller than at this Holiday Inn. Overall, a very average hotel."
146,832,"Jun 28 2006	The Holiday Inn London - Regent's Park is great	I traveled from just outside Euston on a number 30 bus (number 18 goes the same way), using my of peak day travel card (these are a great idea as you can use them on train, underground and buses), to Great Portland Street (underground) station. If you have heavy cases, do not travel to Great Portland Street by train, as there are many stairs.The walk from Great Portland Street station is only a few minutes, though you can see the Holiday Inn from the station exit, to entre the hotel you need to walk along the side of it and round the corner, this is still not far. I arrived early, at approx 11am (Sunday 25th 2006), when check in is at 2pm. As I had an appointment, I asked if I could leave my bags with the concierge. The check in assistant was extreamly helpful , and offered me an early check in! Now, some people seem to think that the test of a good, or even great hotel, is for there to be no problems (which seems silly to me, as problems happen in the best run lives and businesses), however, to me, the test is how staff solve problems and how helpful and pleasent they are when doing so.Having checked in, I went to my room on the second floor, it face and inner courtyard, was a little tired looking and, the main trouble with it was that it smelt musty. So, I returned to check in and told the assistant, (his name is Nicholas) and he change the room straight away, with no problem. This new room was on the third floor, facing out on to a quiet residential street, and had obviously been refurbished (there was no musty smell either). Having been able to freshen up and leave my bags, I went down to reseption again to ask how to get to Highbury and Islington station. Nicholas pointed out the best route to Warren Street underground station (Victoria and Northern line) and called the concierge to make sure that the Victoria line was running. So I made my appointment with time to spare (dispite the fact that most of the underground was *suspended* due to enginering work....check before you travel, though the buses still run, so its not really a problem). If you are carrying a lot of shopping, or bags, go to and from Warren Street on the Victoria line, as there are escaltors, which there arent on the Northern line.The room was plenty big enough for me, and I would think big enough for two people, as you tend not to spend that much time in your room when in London. I dont see the point, at this Holiday Inn, in paying the extra for an Executive room, as its the same room, with extras like a robe, slippers, mineral water, juice and *luxuray* toiletries.In the room you will find, a laptop safe, tea/coffee making area (which is restoked daily, or you can call to have more dilivered), a TV, with Sky one, Sky News, a music channel etc. Desk with desk chair, high speed modem connection (approx.15 for 24 hours), easy chair and side table, and lots of lights. As in many hotels, and especially those that have been refurbished, or are new, the electrical sockets are placed too close to the desk surface, so that you have great difficaulty in plugging things in (the only place I could plug in my phone charger was where the kettle is usually plugged in). If I take my Laptop with me, I usually take a small two way extention lead with me, so I can easily plug in anywhere. Air con did work, but was a little confusing at first. The bathroom is a good size, with a full size bath (I'm 5' 6'' and I could lay out in the bath) and shower, with good presure. There is a container of combined showergel/shampoo on the wall in the shower/bath and another of liquid soap by the hand basin, fannels (face cloths in the US) and towels are provided and the barthroom was pleasantly warm.Breakfast was included in my rate (its worth looking for rates that do include breakfast, and VAT too, if you can find it) and it was really nice, nothing was dry or rubbery, the fried eggs were cooked on a plate infront of you. Various juices, and cerials were also avalible, and I asked for hot milk to go with my coffee, which was no trouble for them at all. Free newspapers are left on a table by the lift on each floor, and there are a selection avalible at breakfast (and by the conciege desk).Between the hotel and Great Portland street, there are two mini Supermarkets, a tesco express and a local store. Tesco is open till midnight and the other is 24hrs.I was booked to stay at another hotel in London, the following weekend. Having checked out the area around the other hotel (the hotel its self was really great and the staff helpful) I decided to see if I could stay at the Regent's Park again, at the same rate. Lis, who had helped me with other questions during my stay, was very helpful and found me the same rate (I always book via the hotels own web site, you get a much better deal that way). So, once home, I cancelled my booking at the other hote and booked at the Regents Park (thank you Vernon for helping when I phoned up after Lis had gone home), so I will be back there in two days for the weekend."
147,832,"Jun 3 2006	good hotel good location	I was looking for a hotel which was clean, close to Soho and not too noisy. The Regent's Park Holiday Inn absolutely met these expectations. The staff was kind and very helpful. In the evening I was a bit cold and phoned housekeeping for an extra blanket. They brought it to my room within 10 minutes. The room I stayed in was handicapped accessible, apparently it was the only room with a king sized bed left. But that was fine, for even if the sink was a litte low for me (I am not handicapped), the room was quite large and the bathroom even bigger.The closest tube station is Great Portland Street. There is a corner shop selling food and drink right next to it, aswell as a supermarket. The hotel is about three minutes walk from the tube and about 10-15 minutes walk from Oxford Street.I had booked two months earlier via the internet and got a rate of approx 150 Euro/night. Of course that's expensive, but considering it's in London, I would say it's OK for what you get at the Regent's Park Holiday Inn. Would definitely stay there again!"
148,832,"May 24 2006	Can't fault it	Was very impressed by this hotel, standards are higher than other Holiday Inns I have stayed in. Room was spacious, bathroom had a great shower! Shame about the view from the window but I suppose that can't be helped. Breakfast was just what the doctor ordered the morning after - fab! Would definitely stay here again."
149,832,"Apr 2 2006	better than expected!	Stayed at the hotel as i was attending an interview there. I found the hotel easy to find, (visible from the tube station) clean, welcoming and friendly. As a woman traveling alone for the first time, I felt completely comfortable and at ease. Reception and restaurant staff were all very helpful, the room was larger than I expected and obviously recently renovated- best night's sleep I'd had in weeks! Would definitely stay again."
150,832,Mar 29 2006	Practical convenient business orientated.	As many other reviewers have said this is a well situated easily accessible functional hotel with good public transport links that is ideal for the business traveller but perhaps a little souless and bland for those wanting a more romantic experience. The rooms are a trifle claustrophobic but are fully equipped and the housekeeping standards appear high. Reception/concierge staff are pleasant and knowledgeable. Breakfast is perfectly adequate but steer clear of the Hotel restaurant - there are several good Mediterranean/ Greek/ Indian eateries of good standard and reasonably priced within spitting distance. There is an attached Conference facility which makes for a busy lobby most of the time. Having stayed here a few times recently the room uptake rate seems high so you will be lucky to get a reduced cost deal.
151,832,"Mar 28 2006 	Well located but ""compact""	I stayed in the Holiday Inn Regents Park on a brief stopover in London.The hotel is well situated, convenient for shopping and nightlife, close to a tube station, but still quiet due to its location on a residential side street.The bedrooms were adequate: a little cramped, but well furnished, standard business hotel facilities - everything you need but somewhat unimaginative. Unfortunately the bathroom was definitely on the cramped side and was also a bit tired - could do with a refurbishment and better planning.The public areas were open and roomy and had obviously been recently (and tastefully) decorated. Buffet breakfast was included in my room rate (GBP 5.00 more than without breakfast) and was certainly worthwhile with a full range of english breakfast items on offer along with cold meats, cheese, various breads etc. Service here was fast and attentive, as was check-in/out.All in all, a decent and convenient hotel for a short stopover, but maybe not so suitable for a longer term stay."
152,832,"Mar 21 2006 	Small rooms are OK if in the right location	My wife and I spend one or two nights in London for business/leisure on average once or twice a month. The Holiday Inn Regents Park is one of our favourite hotels - why?It is certainly not for the architecture - 1970's brick (first two floors) and concrete panel (upper floor) box.It is not for the size of the rooms - which I think are small even by London standards.It may be because of its location - close to our London train terminal (Euston); the three underground stations mentioned by other reviewers; the good bus service to Oxford Circus (buses 88,453,C2 each with a better than 10 minute frequency up to midnight, and a 3 minute off peak journey time) Piccadilly Circus (buses 88&amp;453 - 7 minutes out of rush) Trafalgar Square [resonable for Theatres but also an easy change to routes along the Strand] (88 &amp; 453 - 10 minutes) Houses of Parliament (88 &amp; 453 - 20 minutes) as well as the routes along Euston Road which take you to Madam Taussauds and other areas; being a short walk from Regents Park or a longer walk to Oxford Street or the British Museum. As noted elsewhere, the hotel is in a quiet safe residential / hospital area with good local restaurants, cafes and food outlets.It may because of the facilities in the room - all the amenities we want are crammed in: room safe, internet access, mini bar, trouser press, hairdryer, bath and shower to name but a few. Because of the frequency of my visits (Priority Club - Platinum)we usually get upgraded to an executive standard room which are not any larger but which gives us complimentary fresh fruit, bottled water and orange juice, and a newspaper.It may be because of its good rates - I ruthlessly use the offers on the internet and often get a deal which includes breakfast at a rate close to the standard rate you would pay at a lodge type hotel well outside London without breakfast.It may also be because of the friendly welcoming staff. I have never had anyone who was less than helpful on Reception, in the Restaurant or acting as a concierge (which service it does provide, unlike a number of other chain hotels in London). Other points:The restaurant is fine for breakfast, which is an extensive buffet, if it is included in the rate. If not go elsewhere or do your own. We cannot report on other meals in the hotel as we much prefer the local, usually ethnic - Mediterrean, restaurants around the hotel, or if late back from the theatre bring a salad in from one of the late night foodstores.Car Parking is available at a cost in an NCP car park under the hotel. At weekends and evenings there is some on street meter parking nearby (free between 20:00 and 08:00 hrs) but watch for residents only areas and parking during the day (after 09:30 ?) is available in Regents Park. The hotel is just inside the Congestion Charging Zone - it is possible to leave your car outside the zone and walk in with wheeled cases if desired.Rooms were generally redecorated during 2003 and we have since found them clean and well maintained - although sometimes with the odd hitch. (This last time the TV system went down on the Saturday morning and we had limited fuzzy pictures on the analogue channels only, but it was being fixed when we checked out.) Rooms have heat / air conditioning units and seperate central heating radiators but also windows that open - my first requirement of any hotel. At the Holiday Inn the surrounding area is so quiet, it is a pleasure to have the window open - except on the occasion the builders renonnovating a nearby building decided to load a skip first thing in the morning! The only other source of noise we have noticed is other guests whose have not adopted the corridor ettiquette of trying to be as quiet as a mouse that we aspire to. But these were isolated incidents and are much less frequent than the irritations experienced at any other city hotel we have stayed in.There is no pool or gym.We hope you enjoy the hotel - but do leave room for us on our next visit."
153,832,"Feb 10 2006 	Clean and comfortable	Stayed here for two nights whilst on a training course. Hotel is in excellent location, short walk from Oxford St, and near a tube, but in a quiet, safe mostly residential area. Plenty of good restaurants nearby (I ate in Cleveland Kitchen and Terra). The hotel was spotless everywhere I looked, and very comfortable, the staff helpful. I didn't try any of the hotel's food or bar. Excellent for business trips, my only criticism is the hotel's a fairly soulless concrete box, if you're on holiday you might prefer something with a bit more character."
154,832,"Feb 8 2006	Great hotel in a great location	We got a great deal for this hotel on Expedia, and chose it mostly for its location: just a few blocks from Regent's Park for jogging, very quiet street, near 3 different subway stops that take you anywhere, and only one block from Villandry, a superb gourmet food store, bakery, and restaurant. We went there for breakfast every day (much cheaper than in hotel) and to get provisions for the plane ride home (pastries, breads, etc.) Anyway, the hotel is very new inside, the staff very helpful, and our room was very spacious for London. The bathroom was fine although the water pressure left something to be desired. Overall, I'd stay here again and again because of the reasonable price and the nice location. Do be aware that the nearest subway stop, Great Portland St., closes fairly early at night."
155,832,"Jan 8 2006	Great Location	Both husband and I are regular visitors to London, and we have stayed at this hotel on several occasions. The hotel is in a excellent location being only minutes away from a tube station. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly. This is a great place to stay for anyone who is looking to book a reasonably priced hotel."
156,832,"Jan 5 2006	Good hotel	We booked this hotel through a package on Priceline and were very pleased. We requested a renovated room, and while it was small (by American standards), it was very clean and comfortable. The location is excellent and is literally a 2 minute walk from 2 tube stops (Portland Street and Regent's Park), however, we rarely took the tube to those stops and opted for Oxford Circus instead (which is more central and is also only a 10 minute walk). Travelers should note that the area around this hotel is VERY sleepy. I.e. there is very little to no street or foot traffic when we would leave in the morning and return at night. However, the neighborhood is quite nice and is well situated and safe. The only downside that we experienced was the concierge was not so helpful or knowledgeable - 2 examples: 1) when asked where to go for breakfast he recommended Starbucks. When we said we wanted a place with hot breakfast he had no recommendations (incidentally, Villandry around the corner is very nice as is Cafe Meze next to the Great Portland Street tube stop); 2) when we booked the Original Tour Bus with the Concierge he gave us incorrect information as to where to pick up the bus. Still. overall a good hotel and we would stay here again."
157,832,"Jan 3 2006	Things Go Bump In the Night	I stayed here because everything else was filled up. The heat didn't work, and after fruitless discussions with the desk clerk I went out and bought a small electric heater, then demanded the hotel reduce my bill by the cost (about $30). There were noticeable clanking, banging, and thudding noises 24 hours a day: I guess because it's a '70's vintage concrete UK building and all the mechanical noises like elevators etc. resonate throughout. The hallways are really the worse for wear, and the rooms were pretty small. The whole thing felt claustrophobic to me. The rates were graciously jacked up to around $300 per night because of the tight availability--I wonder why all the other Holiday Inns were filled but this one still had availability? I usually stay the the Holiday Inn at King's Cross, which is much nicer. The only advantage to the Regent's Park is its proximity to lots of things, but I will never stay there again. The whole thing felt second-rate for first-rate prices."
158,832,"Jan 2 2006	We love our stay at this fine hotel!	When we booked this hotel, we expected it to be a decent hotel for a very good price. Wow...we were very happily surprised by how nice this hotel turned out to be. The rooms were modern, clean and a nice size for a London hotel room. The location was very close to the Underground and within walking distance to great shopping including Oxford Street. The staff was pleasant and our room was very quiet and very comfortable. I would stay there again in a second."
159,832,"Jan 1 2006	Beautiful and Cheap Hotel in London	Stayed Dec. 30 to Jan. 3, 2006. Celebrated New Year in London. Beautiful hotel and a very cheap one. The breakfast is excellent. I'm currently writing this review in my room. I did not expect to find a cheap hotel in central London considering all other hotels are at 200 pounds range, meaning 400 Us dollars a night. I got a rate of only 170 US a night. a bargain. London is very expensive so it would be a steal if you could find a decent place to stay, a warm and comfortable accommodation in winter.Stay here, you won't regret it. If you are particular with cost like water and internet fees, then don't think of going to London, I've been to several cities worldwide, by far, London is the most expensive. From the fare, water and tips. So it is important that your accommodation is cheap and at the same time staying in a branded hotel."
160,832,"Dec 22 2005	Lovely hotel	we stay in various Holiday Inns for leisure across the country and this is one of the better ones. The staff are friendly and helpful, the lounge/bar cosy and comfortable and very modern decor leather seats etc. like lots of Holiday Inns in the UK. Breakfast great like all Holiday Inns. One thing is the rooms - theyre spotless and clean all the three times weve stayed in here and have all the facilities you expect, comfy beds, duvet etc. the reason for why the previous reviewer said about some rooms being tired tho is that some floors were given a total makeover a couple of years ago I think and are very contemporary and stylish and look new and everything, I think theyre the 3rd and 5th, last time we stayed there, and some floors look contemporary and v.modern but are a bit more tired cos they were refurbished a couple years previous when it was a posthouse but theyre modern too, and then a couple of floors (like the photos on here) are a bit older. For all I know though they may refurb these rooms by the time you go and one thing in this hotel - is the high standards of cleanliness and maintence is good. The rooms are very comfortable."
161,832,"Dec 15 2005	Oknothing more	Stayed at the holiday-inn early December,hotel is OK at best.Rooms are small,dont book an executive room it is not worth the money,rooms are clean but look a little tired.Staff at reception OK nothing special,staff at breakfast excellent and friendly.Overall just like any other London 3 star hotel"
162,832,"Dec 7 2005	Good hotel.	I stayed there with my wife for eight nights. The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast buffet was extraordinary and the location is great, as most of London's attractions are within a walking distance (Regent's park, Bloomsbury, Oxford circus, Camden, etc...).My only complaint is that my wife asked for an smoking room, and even though our room suited our expectations, the floor in which it was located was not as clean as the rest of the hotel.If you wish to stay there, ask for a non somking room."
163,832,"Nov 27 2005 	Super quiet - esp on the inside	This is a pleasant hotel. For its central location, its great feature is that it is super quiet. The roads around it have very little traffic and if you want a really, really quiet room, demand one on the inside, overlooking the courtyard - that way you can open your windows and never hear even the whisper of a car. The bar is a little soul-less, but there are plenty of good local drinking establishments nearby."
164,832,"Nov 21 2005	Not bad but fairly small rooms	Stayed here on a weekend in London with my wife, catching up with friends. Hotel is reasonably well located; Regent St\Oxford St is not too far to walk but for other areas like Soho, Covent Gdn, Southbank, etc, you'll probably want to take the tube. There are 3 stations within 15 mins walk of the hotel (the closest is &lt; 5 mins) which together cover most lines. The hotel is a typical London chain hotel and a typical Holiday Inn, so you know what to expect. It is clean, tidy, service is pretty good and rooms are comfortable. However, the rooms are pretty small for a holiday inn, even an executive room was not much bigger than the double bed (no king here). Fine for single occupany but a little too small for two. Breakfast was good quality but the usual astronomical London hotel prices (approx 16).Check-in was fast (using Priority Club express check in) but check-out took ages because of a coach-party checking in (seems a frequent occurance). They do have an express check-out but the bill on the TV was wrong so I needed to query it."
165,832,"Nov 9 2005	who could ask for anything more????	First of all, this is NOT an American Holiday Inn. If you're looking for spacious rooms, this is not for you. However, if you've stayed in London before and experienced some of the other hotel offerings, this may be just the place for you.Location - ideal, minutes from Great Portland Street(Circle, District and Hammersmith Lines) and Warren Street(Northern Line) tube stops, within walking distance of Oxford Circus, Regent Street and Piccadilly (40 minutes), Leicester Square and all the theaters (30 minutes), Starbucks (1 minute) and a great street of ethnic restaurants (Cleveland Street) at reasonable prices.One caveat - this is a business area and as a result cabs are hard to come by on weekends. My rate did not include breakfast so I avoided the food scene at the hotel. I would definitely stay here again."
166,832,"Nov 9 2005	Excellent Location Great Value!	We just returned from a 5 day trip and we were very pleased with our accomodations in room 629 on the 6th (top floor) of the hotel. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent just a couple blocks south from the Great Portland Tube with 2 other tube stations within an easy walk. Area felt safe walking at night. Close to Oxford/Regent St. shopping area."
167,832,"Oct 12 2005	Great hotel	Nice and clean. The curtains are extra heavy, so they block out all the daylight! Be sure to put up the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign, otherwise they'll come around 4 or 5 times. The staff was very nice and helpful. The location is great...near the Tube and walking distance to Oxford Circus and Regents. Get the room through Priceline by naming your own price to get the best deal...I did it twice..and both times got this hotel accepted my low price. I was charged 3 times more when I booked directly through the hotel."
168,832,"Sep 9 2005	Great hotel great location	Just returned from a 4 nights stay at the Holiday Inn Regents Park. The hotel was recently refurbished so it was nice to walk into a hotel that wasn't falling apart. Our room was extremely clean with a queen size bed, desk, tv, coffee area, closet, and bathroom. I will say the room was a bit small for the 2 of us -- but we're used to small European hotels. The benefit of this hotel is definitely the location. It is literally a 2 minute walk (1 block) to the Great Portland Street Underground Station. There are also a host of buses within a short walk from the hotel. We definitely had no problem getting around. My only warning is if you do not have your breakfast included in your rate, do NOT eat at the hotel. The breakfast buffet is 15 pounds per person! Don't get me wrong, the food is good, just not really worth the price -- especially when it converts to about 30 US. There's a great cafe right by the Underground station (Cafe Meze) that serves a full English breakfast for 4.95. There is also a pub right nearby (can't remember the name) that serves a great lunch or dinner for a reasonable price. Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The rooms could be bigger, but we didn't spend all that much time in it anyway."
169,832,"Aug 26 2005	Great Hotel.	My family and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Holiday Inn, Regents Park. We had booked two interconnecting rooms and they were perfect. The rooms were more than adequate, and spacious. Room service was very good and the Reception staff were more than helpful, on more than one occasion. We stayed Friday to Tuesday, so we had the week-end and the week days, and there was no difference - we had thought that the week-ends might be busy / noisy but no problem whatsoever. The breakfast was a full buffet style service with plenty of food available. By night the Bar menu was ideal for us, adults and teenagers were catered for. On departure they looked after our luggage while we went out for the day.The hotel is within walking distance ( 5 minutes or so ) of 3 tube stations, several restaurants, 24 hour shops, and a few bars. Oxford Street is within walking distance (15 to 20 Minutes), but everything is accessable by tube or cab.I would strongly reccommend this hotel to any family thinking about staying in London."
170,832,Aug 20 2005	Better than recommended	My wife and me stayed 3 nights at this hotel and it was the first time that we were not at all disappointed about a london hotel. Great value for money. We got a special rate by 14 days advance booking.
171,832,"Aug 20 2005	Location Location Location	A group of us had 3 rooms at the Holiday Inn recently - the location was great. It's only a short walk to Regents Park where they often have open air entertainment (a champagne tent was there when we arrived...heaven!), and not far from Oxford Street, Chinatown, and lots of reasonable pubs.The hotel itself was ok - rooms were pretty small but clean. Our only complaint was that the walls seemed thin and we could hear the people in the next room - one of which was coughing all night long, which did spoil our sleep somewhat. Our friends were also woken very early in the morning by people talking loudly in the corridor - this hotel obviously isn't too great for soundproofing!However the location was the saving grace of this hotel."
172,832,"Aug 7 2005	nice i would reccomended	i stayed at holiday inn regents park for 4 nights in the middle of july 2005, the hotel is nice and clean, rooms are not very big but more than ok for a short stay. the hotel is very closed (2 minutes or less) from great portland tube station. the neighbourhood is quiet even during the night, you can walk from piccadilly circus or oxford circus without any trouble moreover close to the hotel you can find some grocery stores, pubs and restaurant. definitively, if requested, i woould reccomend this hotel in london!!"
173,832,"Aug 2 2005	Great Hotel Good Location - will definitely be back!!!!	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July and would highly recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a quiet place to spend a few nights.The room was compact but well decorated. It had everything you might need for a short stay. The hotel is situated in a quieter area of London and seemed to have a resedential area around it. Tried room service on one evening and it was very reasonable, food was also very good. Bar area was very quiet but the barman kept us entertained! Reception staff were very helpful and pointed us in the right direction more than once!Great Portland St Tube station is literally two minutes walk from the hotel and although it is not on one of the most frequent lines we found it to be a more than adequate service. There are also plenty of small cafes to grab breakfast in the morning."
174,832,"Jul 27 2005	recommended	On our honeymoon in London, we stayed here for a week. Clean, affordable, comfortable rooms. Quiet building. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Except for not actually being within walking distance of anything we wanted to visit, it was perfect. It would have actually been perfect had the Underground system been running at full capacity, as a major tube stop is located one block away. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would consider it for our next stay in London."
175,832,"May 31 2005	Clean comfortable very high quality	We stay here quite regularly for business in London and find it to be a very high quality, clean and comfortable hotel. The staff are all very helpful and attentive and the rooms are very well equipped.Breakfast here is excellent although expensive -a full English buffet with hot and cold food as well as pastries and cereals. There is a wonderful restaurant called Vilandry very nearby where you can get fabulous breakfast for half the price!The location of the hotel is excellent as it is a 5 minute walk from Oxford Circus - however the nearest tube is Great Portland Street and it is serviced by the most unreliable lines on the Underground! It is also not very conveniently connected to other lines - however it is on a direct route to Paddington which is useful for arrival and departure. During your stay it is much better to walk to Oxford Circus during the day and take a taxi at night.An excellent hotel of an extremely high standard, but not cheap."
176,832,"Mar 23 2005	A true holiday at Holiday Inn Regents Park	Holiday Inn Regents Park provided us with two adjoining rooms that were spacious (by London standards) quiet, clean very suitable for my husband, myself, daughter and granddaughter. The buffet breakfast, which was included, was perfect! Convient to three tube stops and located in a neighborhood with many ethenic restaurants, we'd stay there again!"
177,832,"Mar 5 2005 	I keep on coming back	I stay at this hotel regularly on business and choose this hotel over several others in this area of London. Firstly, the hotel is in a very safe neighbourhood and it is comfortable walking back to the hotel in the evening. There are several excellent restaurants nearby - I recommend Villandry which is just across the road on Bolsover Street. The hotel is also very close to two underground train (subway) stations and is also in an area well serviced by taxis so you can just flag one down in the street if you choose. The hotel itself is good. Unfortunately it is housed in a dull 1960s facade but inside the facilities are in good order. The rooms are a good size (for a London hotel - I know our American cousins are used to bigger) and are immaculately clean. The hotel also has very efficient air conditioning which is great in London as sometimes in the summer the air can be stuffy. Breakfasts at the hotel are good but if you prefer not to spend the 12 there are several small cafes / restauarants around the hotel that serve breakfast. The Villandry restauarant (on the road opposite) serves excellent pastries and coffee if you prefer not to have the full English heart attack breakfast! This is also one of the few London hotels that I enjoy room service at as the menu is reasonably priced and the food appetising."
178,832,"Feb 21 2005	Wonderful area!	I stayed at the holiday inn regents park for about ten days. This hotel is in a fabulous area and close to three tube stops (regents park, great portland, and warren street). Don't let the 60's exterior fool you, the interior is warm and inviting. The room was clean and quiet, and the bathroom had everything one would need. Just a very pleasant place and a great value for the price. There is also a starbucks just across the street which is helpful on those early mornings. If you are on a budget, you won't be disapointed."
179,832,"Nov 21 2004	Not a bad place to stay in London	I had first made reservations at the Strand Palace Hotel, but the reviews on Trip Advisor were consistently bad and truly frightened me, so canceled my reservation. So, I did more research and found that the reviews for the Holiday Inn Regent's Park Hotel were not too bad. I stayed one week in the Holiday Inn Regent's Park from November 11-18. Check-in was very quick; however, upon entering the room, I did notice a strong scent, which turned out to be the funky smell of cigarette smoke. I did reserve a non-smoking room, but I was given a smoking room, which was freezing cold because of a draft. A couple hours later, I determined that I could not stay in the room. I called the front desk, and the lady who checked me in said to go downstairs to the front desk at about 4:30 for a room change, as all the rooms would be cleaned and then I would be able to get the room I needed. While waiting for the next room, I call the front desk to complain about the draft, and the front desk agent summoned maintenance to my room. Within ten minutes, two polite gentlemen were there to release a screw to quickly close the outer sliding window. I did, indeed, go downstairs later, and I was immediately given another room; however, upon entry, I discovered a man who had checked into the room about 30 minutes earlier. This happened due to oversight of the front desk agent, who immediately apologized and gave me another room, which was perfect. There seemed to be maintenance work on the fourth floor. The room I got was small, but the bathroom was certainly larger than the first room. The bed was big and comfortable, and the walls were not so thin to hear any noises from adjacent rooms. The room also had a tv with built-in alarm and an easily operable safe. The heating system was easy to operate and worked properly. After the initial rooms mix-up, I never had any trouble with the staff nor the room. Other than for horribly smelling smoking room, I never noticed any bad scents. All staff were very helpful, and they all addressed my questions or requests right away. The rooms are very comfortable, and the hotel is located near the good locations of central London. Further, as I discovered during my last couple days, the Great Portland Station is just a two or three-minute walk around the corner and up the street from the hotel, so catching a train is easy and covenient. The area is very clean and quiet, and walking at any time of the day is safe and pleasurable. I ordered meals via room service several times, and each time the meal was delivered before the time they said it would be ready. The staff delivering the meals were very kind and polite, and the food actually was good in quality and portions, so I have no complaints. Good things I tried on the menu: Pizza, hamburgers, chicken club sandwich, and chicken and bacon burger, and a couple deserts. The Brit Vic 55 sparkling apple drink is great, too. The hotel is not 4-star, but it is very clean, modern, and quiet, and the staff is polite and attentive to the concerns of the guests. You can also change up to $100 US dollars daily at the front desk. However, do refrain from using the phone, as it is quite expensive-3 pounds per minute for international calls and 50 pence per minute for local calls! There is one computer terminal to right of the lobby at a cost of 3 pounds per 15-minute session-which you can pay for with a credit card. There was a fire alarm at 1:00 am during my first night, and the fire department (brigade) was called. The next day, the management delivered a letter apologizing for the alarm. I definitely would stay there again, but I would try to get a better rate than which I paid. I paid the regular rate because of time constraints and limitation of similar decent accommodations in London at that rate. The hotel is clean, quiet, safe, and in a good area, and the service is good."
180,832,"Nov 5 2004	One of the best holiday inns	The staff were friendly, the hotel was fabulous and the location was brilliant .there is a tube station a minute away from the hotel which brought you everywhere within minutes. one of the best holiday inns i've stayed in."
181,832,"Sep 28 2004	Great Value Hotel	We enjoyed this Holiday Inn very much. We found a very good rate on the Holiday Inn Web site for a double (Queen Bed) and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and style of this hotel. The room was spacious by London standards, and the bed very comfortable. Service was very good. We did not have breakfast at the hotel (too expensive) but there are many little cafes close by which make great low-cost breakfasts so this was not a problem. The Hotel is in a good area and there is easy access to public transport. This Hotel was probably the best &quot;bargain&quot; find of our entire stay in the UK - we would recommend it and would stay there again if the rates were similar."
182,832,"Sep 23 2004	OK in the end beginning was a struggle	My parents stayed at this hotel a few months ago. We don't know what we were expecting but...The bored looking receptionist (suited more to sell mobile phones) gave my father the worst room at the hotel. The hotel was going through renovation (which was needed!) and the room was at the back of it all: you had to walk endless corridors with bits hanging out from the ceiling, and yes - a smell of urine came across as well as we finally came to door number 436. The room was small, of 2/3 star standard. We had booked a non-smoking room which this clearly wasn't either.My parents decided to sleep through the night anyway but were kept awake by the fire alarm at the hotel which went off 3 times! Good thing obviously that it works in case there was a fire but was a bit of a nuisance towards the end.Next morning another surprise occurred on floor 4: you could not take the lift downstairs. My parents and a few other customers were directed downstairs through fire exit and the staff areas. Only then did my father complain, and they were upgraded to a floor above, which was a like a new world! We suppose floor 5 is something you would expect from this hotel - 4 star, and part of the Holiday Inn company. Bad luck was involved with this experience clearly but I think hotels should think twice before accommodating their guests in dodgy rooms like 436 in the middle of a construction site."
183,832,"Aug 30 2004	Very good for the rate	Been in almost all the Hiltons and the Intercontinentals in London (since I usually get there at least six times a year) and this hotel is remarkable because it is clean, not expensive and well located.Of course, is not like staying in a good Mayfair or Chelsea hotel; but If you're not on honeymoon and you do not expect too much, that is the right place to choose, if you get a good rate (as twice I had, in my two stays there, for a total of seven days, last one being on July 2004): after all it's a Holiday Inn, and not a five star resort.The room was nice and clean, with a fresh put minibar; the bathroom, though, is as big as a telephone booth and the shampoo is (very modern, very cheap, but definitely not chic) hanging in a dispenser from the wall of the tub, like in the motels in a remote state of the U.S.; which can be good for homesickness, if you're american.The four out of five is due, essentially, to the very good value rate, not to the service, to which I would give a beautiful (2), having been asked for a cash security in order to get an adaptor for the hairdryer: was it actually that necessary, since they had my room number and credit card deposited?"
184,832,"Aug 16 2004	What You Would Expect from a Holiday Inn	I spent the first week of August at the Holiday Inn London - Regent's Park. I got a fabulous rate on the hotels website and was very satisfied with my stay. The rooms are no smaller than you would expect from London but are in pristine condition. The staff were incredibly helpful, to the extent that one of the desk staff lent me her personal cellphone charger when no transformers were available for me to use my own. The location is in a lovely quiet area five minutes walk away from Regent's Park. Between the two tube stations that are around the corner from the hotel you can get on most of the main tube lines. There is a 24 hour store down the road for essentials, and it is a pleasant 20 minute stroll to Oxford Street. Overall, I'm not sure I would pay the rack rate for this hotel, but as there are many offers both on the hotel site and British Airways site or Expedia, you should never have to. For the price it met and exceeded my expectations."
185,832,"Aug 12 2004	Great place to stay in London	Stayed at this hotel for five nights in july. Got a nice rate at british airways holiday web page. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are a little bit small, but comfortable and clean. Being my first time in London I had some doubts about it's location, but it turned out to be a quiet area, and quite safe to walk at night. It's walking distance from Oxford St. and it's shops, and also there are two subway stations nearby. Our rate included full-breakfast, which was very good indeed, buffet style and with several options. A nice place to rest after a busy day in London."
186,832,"Jul 28 2004	Great for shops and theatre	Very well run and immaculately clean hotel, staff could not do enough to help us, great value for money"
187,832,"Jul 26 2004	Super place to stay	We stayed three nights at this hotel at the beginning of July. I got a good rate at the hotel's own website and was more than pleased with the room we were allocated. It was pristinely clean, had air-conditioning, plus it was quiet. We never ate at the hotel, but in the vicinity there were several restaurant options. On nearby Cleveland Street we ate breakfast each morning at the Bon Appetite cafe where the owners were delightful and the food delicious and reasonably-priced. Harts the Grocers, near Portland Street underground station was excellent for incidentals, and only a few yards from the hotel itself.If returning to London, I would gladly stay at this Holiday Inn again."
188,832,Jul 19 2004	Good hotel... shop around for a good price	Stayed here on two separate occassions in July'04. The rooms were nice and well kept. It's a solid 3 star or a weak 4 star hotel. It is very close to the tube station and fairly convienent. Saw a wide variation in the pricing so do some shopping.
189,832,"Jun 29 2004	Great Service	My family and I enjoyed our stay here. Even though the rooms were pricey, after 16 hours of travelling, we found it comfortable and enjoyable. There are 18 channels on the TV, I desk and a nice leather chair for you to sit in. Bathrooms came with a bath mat, a rail for you to hold onto if you are handicapped, and shampoo and lotion for your shower."
190,832,"Jun 29 2004	Great value and location	We just returned from five nights at this hotel and recommend it for location and cleanliness. We found it on Priceline, asking for a four-star in the Regent's Park area. Paid $110 incl. tax but not breakfast. Our room was small, but sufficient for opening two suitcases, quiet, never heard anything from outside or other rooms. Two very comfortable beds with choice of pillows, large windows with heavy drapes we could shut against the 10 p.m. daylight. Clean bath with deep tub, self-serve safe which was nice for passports and cash. We did not eat there as it was pricey, but bought snacks from corner store.Great location on quiet street, close to Tube and bus at corner. Several restaurants nearby. Easy walking to Tottenham, Oxford Street, Euston Station, British Library, Madam Tusseaud's, hop-on hop-off bus. We would stay there again.Our only problem was with concierge who was too busy to help much and desk clerks kept referring us to the concierge."

1,837,"Jul 16 2009 	not that bad	After reading the reviews I was kind of leary about this hotel. I am glad to say it was not that bad. My room was on the bottom floor by the dining room. Yes the rooms are small but I had an en-suite and it had a small fridge also so I could not complain. It is a little noisy but then anything close to the train station is going to be. The rooms were cheap and that is what most people want but with that price you cant expect it to be fancy.. The front desk was always friendly and helpful, and I found the hotel to be very close to most everything I wanted to see. I can not comment on the breakfast as I did not eat there--I was either already gone on a sightseeing tour or sleeping a little late. The train station is very close with a small groc there or many small restaurants around. I would stay there again if I come back to London"
2,837,"Jun 1 2009 	If you want a terrible sleep and bed bugs holly house is for you.	My sister and I stayed here for 2 nights in a twin room en suite. They put us into the annex building a few doors down from the main hotel.the positive: it's very close to victoria station, and walking distance to Buckingham palace (20 minutes). breakfast was included, and the staff serving breakfast was quite nice and helpful. there was a mini fridge in the room and a small TV. Now onto the negative: We arrived around 5:30pm in the rain and there was no one at reception to let us in the building, we rang the bell for 10-15 minutes before they finally answered. While we were being checked in, a man who looked like a homeless person came into the small reception area and was eyeing us. that should have been our cue to leave, but I thought it would be okay. the room was TINY. we could barely move around in it. you had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom, and the bathroom was a cupboard. It was like a toilet on a train. tiny. tiny. tiny. they gave us bath towels, but no hand towels. and everything in the bathroom gets wet when you shower because it's that small.the first night I slept fine, but the second night I didn't sleep very well at all, and didn't figure out until morning that it was because there were BED BUGS eating me up. I woke up with bites on my feet &amp; legs and waist, but the worst was my arms, shoulders and back. I still have discoloration from the bites. I would not ever ever ever recommend this hotel to anyone. DO NOT STAY HERE."
3,837,"May 24 2009 	NEVER AGAIN!!!	Ok so cheap budget room in London! Not expecting much here! But oh dear!!! The &quot;double&quot; bed was maybe 3 inches bigger than a standard single. It was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in! I would have slept on the floor, but there was not enough room to do so! I was also a bit wary of all the bugs crawling around the floor and shower.The bed was itchy and lumpy. The TV had very poor signal. The en-suite toilet! Well when you took a shower you were also washing the toilet pan! I am a 16st 6ft tall man and i was hitting my arms on the walls and head on ceiling. Was like taking a shower in a room the size of a toilet on a bus!The noise and heat in the room was fair enough! Its London after all! After a 12 hour bus journey all I wanted was a good nights sleep, but i would be lying if I said i had more than 1 hours sleep in broken 5 minute intervals!As for the comment on page 1 of the hotels website....&quot;Our warm, friendly hospitality is second to none, matching the stylish facilities and quality service to the perfect location.&quot;OMG!!! The staff did not smile, were not very friendly and really not overly helpful! I never saw any &quot;stylish faclities&quot; or &quot;quality service&quot;!The location is perfect for the tube, bus st and palace! There is always a gopod point.We were booked in for 2 nights (and charged for the 2 nights on arrival)After the first night we could not bear facing breakfast in that place! 1st thing we did that morning was to go round the corner to a bigger hotel. They gave us a big comfy room, with clean bathroom and facilities and free wi-fi.We paid a little more for this one, but worth every penny! They even let us check in at 9am so we could get out of the Holly House Hotel.The receptionist was NOT surprised to hear how unhappy we were with the Holly hotel (guess it must be a common occurence).I felt dirty after staying in this hotel. I will never be back. I have stayed in some bad places in my travels, but this was by far the worst I have ever been in.I guess they must have some nice rooms as a few people have made positive comments about the place! I would guarantee that if they were in our room from that night, they would have thought twice about a good review!"
4,837,"May 19 2009 	Very very basic	We were put in the Annexe part of the hotel on the top floor in a TINY standard room (only one person could walk round the bed at the same time). It was at the back of the hotel so the train noise from Victoria was VERY loud as you were overlooking the lines. It had a washbasin, TV, small fridge (which noisily came on and off all night) and tea/coffee making facilities. All generally clean although the carpet needed a good hoovering. Towels and sheets were clean and fresh. Shared shower and toilet area combined, outside on landing. It was the smallest area you could imagine (less than 5 feet by 2 feet) so when you had a shower all round the toilet flooded too! Breakfast was cornflakes or cocoa pops, orange juice, toast with various jams and tea or coffee.Having said all of that it was a reasonable price for such a central location, some people wouldn't like it but as we were going to be out sightseeing all day, all we wanted was a room with a bed for the night, which is just about what we got."
5,837,"Apr 13 2009	Very good for such price	Please, compare prices of London Hotels. More of them is very expensive. It's very small and cheap hotel. I think, it's excellent for budget trip. Do not expect for 3 or 4 stars!!!We (family of 3 people) stayed there in early March in Triple Ensuite Room. Bathroom is inside the room. It very-very small, but enough. Room is very-very small, but enough :) It's smallest room I have ever seen. But we were in London first time, we had only 4 days and we only slept in the room and use bathroom in mornings and evenings.They made our room every day, our linen and towels was always clean.Breakfasts include in price. It's corn-flakes with milk, toast with butter and jam, orange juice and tea or coffee. In room you can find towels, cattle, glasses, cups, spoons, tea, coffee and sugar, small fridge. You can have hair drier for deposit 5 pounds.Location is great! Bus station is very close(we use bus for airport transfer and for trip in Windsor) and underground is just in few blocks. I didn't like stuff on check-in desk and on breakfasts. We have no problems with them, but I think they can smile even sometimes..."
6,837,"Aug 24 2008 	just okay but you get what you pay for i guess...	well, i think that these guys get a worse rap than is warranted. it definitely is by no means a luxury hotel or even an at all nice one. this is VERY basic accomodation, with almost no amenities. but it is probably the cheapest place to stay in london, so if that is what you are looking for then that is what you are going to get. the people that run it are more cordial than the reviews would lead you to believe, though i would not say that they are nice or smiley or anything. the rooms seem to be a little dirty and the bathroom was mostly unfinished (this gave it a dirty look even though it probably wasn't). it is close to the train station, and we could hear the trains coming in, but it was not insanely loud and in fact my boyfriend rather enjoyed it. the location is the best part. it is very close to virginia station and walking distance to buckingham palace and st. james' park. the breakfast was indeed just cornflakes, toast, butter &amp; jam, with instant coffee or tea and juice, but what can you do? this is the european way."
7,837,"Jul 15 2008 	Very Good Basic Hotel	I called the Holly House and made my own reservation.The Holly House Hotel is a very basic hotel. If you are expecting a large, elegant rooms with service 24 hours a day, this is the wrong hotel for you. If you want a basic room, in a very convenient location, this might just be the place for you. My room was on the 3rd floor and had a small refrigerator. The toilet was about 6 steps up from my room and the shower on the floor below. This hotel does have en-suite rooms but I could only afford the basic. I was greeted nicely by the owner/manager and was always treated kindly. The breakfast was again basic but enough. The rooms were quiet and a wonderful breeze kept my room cool even during the several rather warm days. Each room has a colour TV and tea and coffee facilities. The hotel backs up to train tracks right at Victoria Station and I was afraid that the noise would bother me but I was never disturbed by any noise at all.I stayed at the Holly House over 3 weeks so I was there long enough to get to know the area. I will stay there again in the future as I visit London every year."
8,837,Mar 20 2008 	No No No	Unclean and the staff was definitely intimidating. I was traveling as a single woman and please do not go there if you are single woman traveling alone. I would go out every evening for dinner and the staff would be out smoking with friends or other staff members and they would be obviously saying lude things about me walking away from the hotel. I would actually sleep with the lights and tv on to make them think I was up in the middle of the night (even though the tv didn't go very loud) and this place gave me the heabie jeebies. It was unclean and I couldn't wait to get out of there. So much so that my flight didn't leave until the late afternoon the day I left and I checked out on that day at 9 am and because of luggage...went straight to the airport. No way was I storing my luggage while I went sightseeing for a few hours. Lock your luggage in the room. I just had a bad feeling like I was being watched!!!!
9,837,Feb 7 2008 	Okay okay	Same same is a simple bed and breakfast in london super location and close to tube station - the room was small but okay and clean i found the staff friendly and helpful
10,837,"Oct 14 2007 	Hotel behind subway station!!!	Roos are extremely small and most of them overlooking the train station. I asked for a quiet room and the receptionist who works in the evenings ( a very unfriendly guy) gave me a room in the Alexander Hotel (which is the same crap hotel belonging to the Holly House) with a view to the platform of the London underground!!. The room in question has the weird name of AA.I told him to give me another room, and although he pretended to find something better for me, it was obvious that he didn't care. So he ended up saying that either I should take it or leave it; Actually that was what I did next day (before being sure that I got back the rest of the cash I paid in advance the day before). Be careful because they ask for the whole amount in advance. So if you decide to reserve a room here, don't pay till you have seen the room. The toilets are so small that you wonder how you can get in (no joking)I have to admit that the receptionist in the morning-afternoon are friendly and helpful but the guy in the evenings tends to act against guest's desires"
11,837,"Feb 15 2007 	Dont trust this place.... Theft of Belongings!	We confirmed our week long stay at the Holly House Hotel 2 days before arriving in London. They asked us how much we had been quoted.... which i thought odd given that they had the booking sheet in front of them, but nonetheless, we confirmed the booking. When we arrived - went into the reception of the Holly House and were given keys to another hotel further down the street - the Cedar House Hotel. It appears that the owners run almost every hotel on the street! We did not mind too much about this - however it would have been nice to have been told that what room we booked online was NOT what we would be getting when we arrived. We had stated our time of arrival as being 10am and we arrived at 12pm. The room was NOT ready. The room stank of fresh and stale cigarette/cigar smells, there was rubbish everywhere and the bed was not made up. We sat outside and waited while the cleaner made the room up - and though she changed the sheets - she did not change the doona cover. Gross. Once we aired out the room - the smell of smoke dissipated slightly however we still had trouble breathing easily in the room for the duration of the stay. One day before we were due to check out - we returned to our room to find that all of our valuables had been stolen. Notebook Computers, MP3 Players, Digital SLR Camera (Over $8000 worth of goods) were all gone (we were migrating - not on holiday) including one entire bag of belongings. NOt only had the thief / thieves taken our things from three different bags - they had put all of our bags back exactly as they had been when we left them so we did not notice that our valuables were missing straight away. There was no forced entry and our room was locked when we left it. We advised manager on duty who advised that the Manage would come to see us. He never did. We called the police - who came to the hotel and attempted to enter the room without a key - (to see how easy it was) and could not do this successfuly ! He interviewed the manager and staff and asked manager to provide cctv footage from inside the hotel however this came up with nothing. Police advised us that they had been to this hotel 12 months previous for thefts and determined that a staff member had been stealing at that time. We went to the Manager (who still did not seek us out), and he basically told us it was our problem, and that we should not have left our valuables in the room (this said - we are not stupid and would not normally do so however as we had moved to the UK - we could not carry all of our things with us all of the time - and we were not provided with any alternative to keep our belongings safe). The fact that the room appeared to have been entered with a key, that the cleaners go into the room every day and leave the window open when they leave, that the thieves had apprently known where all of our valuables were (as there was a limited timeframe in which the theft occurred) and that the bags and cases had been put back carefully where they had been left did not seem to ring any alarmbells to him. It was still our problem.We started off being very calm and requested a refund for that night as we did not feel safe staying in a room that is is so insecure and unsafe, and afer arguing for a long ime - we eventually got the refund for that night - and we promptly left and found a great place at Earls Court Garden Hotel. This was a devastating experience for us that shook us up enormously and has severely impacted on our arrival in London. It is avery basic, not so clean, not so comfortable hotel which is not safe. I have travelled extensively through Asia and always stafe in budget hotels and hostels however it is worth it to spend a little bit more or get out of the city a bit and you will get much better value and security."
12,837,"Feb 13 2007	Cheap and horrible!!!!!!!!!	I had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of staying in this hotel for 5 nights! Yes, i did manage to survive! I booked the hotel from website and was never warned what i was about to experience! OK, it is really cheap and dead central but, dear God i would not never repeat that experience! The rooms are tiny (i booked a double room and 2 people cannot have their suitcases open at the same time!!!!), the curtain and carpet had not been washed for maybe a decade, the bed linen were not changed thoughtout my stay, we did however have clean towels every day. The WC and shower rooms are equally claustrophobic and dirty especially the shower room! Oh, did i mention the broken window in my room and the leaking ceiling (when the people in the upstairs room were taking a shower, it was leaking in my room !!!!) I will not of course mention the two arguments that i had with the reception clerk who was quite rude and sarcastic! Do yourselves a favour, if you plan on staying in London for more than 1 night, don't stay there, you deserve better than that !!!!"
13,837,"Jan 13 2007 	Value for Money	Don't know what people are complaining about! This a low-priced hotel located within walking distance of most of London's tourist traps along with Victoria Coach Station and Victoria Rail Station. It is not the Dorchestor, Hilton, or the Ritz, and anyone should know this by the cost, for the same price as an over-night stay one wouldn't get a meal at the Ritz. The rooms at HHH could be a little fresher, but lets' face it we're talking basically about a bed for the night, not a suite of rooms etc.The hotel was quiet at night which is extremely important. Ok trains running into Victoria can be a pain. At less than 40 for a room, the HHH is ok."
14,837,"Nov 28 2006 	Horrible Hotel	Let me begin by saying that I am an experienced budget traveler that has lived in Europe. So I am not expecting The Ritz when I check into a 70 pound room. What I do expect is the room to be clean. There was standing dirt on the carpet through out the entire room. To mask to dirt smell the management placed large purple air fresheners throughout the room. The combination was overpowering. The room was a triple with a double bed and a set of bunk beds. There was approximately 2 feet between the top and bottom bunks making it difficult for an adult to use the lower one. There was only an18 inch path between the two beds, and the bathroom door could only open half way because of the overcrowding of the room. For one person to get dressed the other two had to literally sit on their beds to allow room. I have stayed in some very basic accommodations but this was by far the worst hotel I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that does not just want a dirty basic place to crash for a night."
15,837,"Nov 17 2006	absolute nightmare	I was in London for a short stay and a self prescribed low budget trip.Booking a room near Victoria seemed like a sensible thing to do since it was close to my area of interest.I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much but even so I was amazed that such a place could exist in central london.The room was filthy and smelly and it hasn't been cleaned in years.For an additional 3 pounds I was promised an en suite batroom wich was nothing else than a airing cupboard tranformed into a loo with an incorporated rusty shower squeezed into the corner.The trains from Victoria rushed right past my head by the minute but the worst part was listening to the continuing announcements -opening the window seemed sheer madness at the time.By 7am I was wide awake and left the hotel without any breakfast because I was too annoyed to eat and not convinced by their hygenic standards.Overall impression?If you want to listen to moving trains, book a bench at Victoria Station.It's cheaper!!!!"
16,837,"Oct 4 2006 	Gool Location 	My overall experience was good. Close to public transportation, Friendly staff &amp; affordable price. Breakfast was good &amp; rooms are nice to stay. Only one thing is negative, Very close to Victoria station &amp; noise problem."
17,837,"Sep 26 2006 	Disgusting terrible the managers rude...	It was horrible, it was the only thing that made my travel to London to be a little bad... we had made the reservations via internet. We went from spain, and we had the copy of the reservation. But, when we arrived there, the &quot;manager&quot;, that... &quot;nice&quot; man, so pleasant, and so.... I don't know how to describe him... rude? told us that we had not made a reservation for a room with bathroom. then we told him we wanted bathrooms, and he wanted to put us all (six people) in a room which was no more than 8 square metres. Finally, we found three double rooms with bathroom (it was exactly a cupboard which had become a bathroom). My bedroom was inclined, so the floor was not 90 degrees to the wall, but more or less 110, so my feet slept higher than my head... It was a complete disaster... The boy who took us to our bedrooms only pointed to the fact that the rooms had TELEVISION.... yes, there was a teapot...but.. who could drink there?!!!And finally, the best of all... we could not pay by card. He wanted us to pay a part in cash and another part by card. This made us suspicious that he was getting undeclared income. so we told him he was a thief, and we were calling the police... he told us that he was the one who was going to call the police and we would go to jail hahaha... The best of all was when he threw us out...Yes, he threw us out of his hotel, shouting and insulting... And then he apologized and he told us he expected to see us there again..... hahahaha Isn't he mad?If a manager treats people in such a rude way, what can he expect but not to see his customers again?In short: the worst experience in my travels."
18,837,"Aug 16 2006 	Reservations are useless	I found a room in London for less than 30 pounds. I reserved well in advance before my travel. I knew I couldn't expect much, all I need was a place to sleep a nigth, before continuing my trip.Well... I arrived from the Americas afther a long trip and badly sleep. I had some troubles finding it, but it was ok. When I finally found the place, they told there was a problem with my reservation, something about my credit card they said. And unfortunatly they didn't had any room for me.They told not to worry and chose any of the nearby hotels, tell them I was their customer and they will give me a room, I asked at to places... they say they were full. I returned a got very angry, they took me to another hotel which had I think and emergency room. It wasn't so nice and they charged me about 5 pounds more then what I had reserved at the first hotel.It was an awful experience, they made me loose valuable time for touring the city, they spoiled my short visit at London.I understand you can expect much for a room under 30 pounds, but at least you expect it will be avaiable when you arrive.I strongly recomend not to reserve this hotel, maybe if you arrive without reservation and are lucky enough they'll have a cheap room. But you can't trust on your reservation."
19,837,Jun 1 2006	It is a budget hotel	It is a budget hotel. You are not paying more so you could not expect more. Over all my experience is not bad you can afford the prices. Very reasonable stay in Victoria. Location is very good except noise from the train running back of the hotel. But who expect more service and more laxurious there is Blair Victoria hotel a five star hotel five minutes from Holly house hotel.
20,837,"May 30 2006	planning to book here..? don't!	Bookings dont mean anything to the &quot;managers&quot; of this hotel. We had booked well in advance, had given bank details in order to &quot;guarantee&quot; the rooms and had received two confirmations of the bookings. There were no mistakes or misunderstandings on our part. On arrival we were informed that the rooms were not available.....period.Absolutely unethical behaviour...to say the least."
21,837,Feb 27 2006	Horrendous	Well if only I had read the reviews before. It is very cheap but clearly the worst B+B I have ever stayed in. Also don't be fooled by the explanation that they have had problems with flooding etc and need to relocate you as this seems the excuse they always use. We had booked a room with ensuite but had to have a double room with shared bathroom in another hotel which was so disgusting you would not want to walk on the floor without shoes!  Yes they do own all the B+Bs on that street.If it had not been for being tired and not knowing the area we would certainly have gone elsewhere!If that's not bad enough wait til breakfast the staff look dirty. It was so unorganised and I have never had such horrendous service before. The staff were so rude ordering people to sit on seperate tables and muttering in their own language whilst waving their arms around. It was so bad that we went without breakfast on both mornings.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!
22,837,"Dec 16 2005	Terrible But Cheap	We made the reservation via internet and when we got there,there was no room,although we called the previous evening. they offered a tiny single room for two people giving no explanation. We spent the first night in another b&amp;b(horrible too). The second day at eleven they offered a temporal twin room in one of the b&amp;b they manage, and the third day at the same time we moved to the final room. we missed a lot of time there.This is the cheapest b&amp;b in london but awful staff and bad organization, some smelly rooms. they rule alexander,anexe,ivy,holly house,cedar b&amp;b, all terrible."
23,837,"Nov 21 2005	Cheap	We booked this hotel because we only needed a one night stay before an early morning flight out of Gatwick. This room was very inexpensive, and the hotel was located very close to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Express.When we arrived, we were actually placed in the Cedar Guest house down the street. We had a double with shared bath. Our room faced the street and was very quiet. The bathroom faced the rear of the building and had a lot of train noice.The room was extremely small; by far the smallest room we had in all of our european travels. The room was not the cleanest, and I would not have wanted to stay there for more than one night."
24,837,"Oct 10 2005 	Be warned!	The person that owns this hotel owns all the hotels on the even-numbered side of Hugh Street (i.e 20, 22, 24 etc). Thus you will find the Cedar Guest House, Annexe Hotel and others also advertised but they are all of the same quality but slightly different price. I found out from the staff when I booked into the higher priced Cedar Guest House and was given a room in the lower priced Holly House (with no price refund - talk about thieves!) and when I was eventually moved to the Annexe Hotel, I realised what they said was true! All the (bad) reviews are true - not a good place to bring your family but almost bearable if you are travelling alone and trying to save money. I got woken up every morning at around 5.30 when the trains started going. Try and get a room at the front of the hotel. You may aswell book into the cheapest Holly House hotel because your booking is unlikely to have any bearing on where you finally stay!"
25,837,"Sep 10 2005	Dirty noisy awful service	When we were booking this hotel we looked at the map, but we failed to realize that the hotel seems to be suspiciously close to Victoria station. When we arrived, it appeared that the trains just go under your window. Victoria is a very busy station and the trains are there every couple of minutes day and night. The noise is unbearable. After one night we complained to the staff and they moved us into another room that was below the ground level so the noise was quiter, but only by a fraction.The rooms are old, dirty and very small. When you order the room that is proudly announced as &quot;triple&quot; you can get a room with a two-level bunk bed and another small bed crowded into an area size of a telephone booth. The bathroom en-suite means an area just large enough to fit a toilet - if you want to take a shower, you stand on the floor near the toilet and the water just goes over everything.They do &quot;clean&quot; the room every day, but it just means making your bed without changing the linen. They do not refresh the supplies like soap, shampoo, coffee, or even towels.The only nice thing about this hotel is location - it is about five minute walk to the Victoria undeground station. On the other hand, with excellent London public transportation system, it is not that important.Overall impression - never again! Also keep in mind that there are several hotels on Hugh street (Holly House Hotel, Alexander House Hotel, and more) that actually are the same hotel - they use the same reception. The quality seems to be the same."
26,837,"Jun 7 2005	What a shock about midnight!!!	We arrived in the Holly House &quot;Hotel&quot; about midnight attended 2 children.I had reserved two double rooms with own shower/toilet. The guys told me, that we can get this booked rooms tomorrow and showed us two other double rooms as a replacemenet for this night. What have we seen? Small, total dirty rooms under the roof, cleaned last time some month ago...Our first idea was to abscond and search for another hotel, but our children were very tired. So we asked for new bedclothes at least, got a special price for this night and searches for another hotel in the morning of the next day!"
27,837,"Apr 25 2005	Perfect spot/price	perfect spot since it's near the victoria station,restaurants and the major sights and spots! very nice staff."
28,837,"Nov 29 2004	very good	Given the prices for hotels in London, i think it is by far the cheapest you can find. Perfect location! 2 minutes from the subway, 15 min walk from Big Ben. The staff is very nice, just be nice to them as well. Its not an american 2 star hotel but for european standards and the amount of money you pay given London prices, the hotel is very good."
29,837,"Nov 6 2004	Holly Hole under Trains	I have booked two double rooms. It was confirmed two days before my arrival.When I have arrived with my family I was proposed 4 singles &quot;holes&quot; 1,40mx2mx1,90m under trains passing over your heads every 5 min.I have find a normal hotel not far from &quot;Holly Hole under Trains&quot;"
30,837,"Oct 11 2004	Cheap but terrible	I booked this hotel from website, however I was arranged to stay in cedar hotel. The room was very small and just next to railway, you could hear noise when train passed by. I would not recommend this hotel even though it's cheap and close to Victoria station."
31,837,"Sep 22 2004	Value for money	I was planning a day out in Central London, I did not read the reviews before I went to the Holly House Hotel, but I must say its a clean value for money B&amp;B, I'm surprised people are complaining about this hotel because I personally think it's not true, I mean what do you want for  40 GBP a night in the heart of London.The Rooms were a bit small but they were clean and kept tidy, so were the ensuites they were also clean, my suggestion is if anyone is looking for low budget rooms Holly House is the best place, they have got the location and they also have what a budget client needs"
32,837,"Sep 1 2004	It's totally horrid!	It was my 1st visit to London on the 31st of July 2004. My family had booked a tour with the Trafalgar agency in Victoria and had to be there at 6.30am the following mor. That's why we sourced for a family room for 4 with connecting toilet in Victoria itself. I think it was agreed that we're to pay 85 pounds for that one night. It's a bed and breakfast place.If you are thinking along the same line.. staying somewhere near the Trafalgar agency in Victoria. Trust me on this. Don't stay here!My sis had booked us a family room with the Ivy House Hotel for the agreed amount of 85 pounds. She chose this hotel as there weren't many reviews on this hotel but horrid ones for the nearby Annex House Hotel and Holly House Hotel. When we got there, we found out the Ivy House Hotel, Cedar House Hotel, Holly House Hotel and Annex House Hotel at Victoria are all under the same management. Wherever you book, either one of this 4, it's really up to the management to put you whereever they want.We've come across reviews from others that Annex House has the reputation for not giving you what you had booked earlier. You have to settle for something less that what you'd booked. For our case, the management gave us 2 rooms. One musky double room on the last level with a filmsy lock without toilet attached. The other was a double with an attached toilet. Ok, the 2nd room wasn't that bad cos of the toilet. Other then the toilet bit, the room was equally musky, with poor ventilation. The common toilets aren't exactly clean for the record. We weren't trilled with the 2 rooms. Especially when we wanted a family room. Sides, they weren't apologetic about not being able to give us what we had agreed on, and had the cheek to argue with us over the state of matters. One guy even challeneged us to look for alternative accomodation. After travelling for over 19 hours, and arriving at 9pm local time, that's the last thing we wanted. The conditions of the rooms were absolutely appalling and the attitude of the management really spoilt the mood of our much awaited family vacation. A word of advise for people joinning Trafalgar tour, stay somewhere near Earls Court. Preferably near Ibis Hotel. You can hitch a ride with fellow tour mates there early in the morning."
33,837,"Aug 6 2004	Terrible holly hotel	This hotel (holly house hotel) is infected with bugs in the bed.You register with Ivy but they give you this hotel.IVy ,holly,cedar etc.. are the same hotel on the street.Check the beds before check in. Terrible if you are allergic with the bug's bite."

1,838,Jul 27 2009 	Clubbie	Old fashioned club atmosphere with all the advantages and disadvantages that go with that. Some might call it stodgy or snobby but most would call it elegant. Everything is old but the rooms are well decked out. Food is fair and drinks expensive but the atmosphere and location are excellent. Lots of door in corridors a bit strange but you definately feel like you are in London!
2,838,"Apr 22 2009 	Wonderful historic house great place to stay	Home House is an absolute gem--the original central building, an important architectural masterpiece of Robert Adam from the 1770s, is lovingly restored &amp; maintained. It could be a top-quality museum house (like Syon or Osterley) &amp; instead it's available as a &quot;Home away from home.&quot; This alone is worth a visit--you really have to see it to believe it. Then it has been added on to, on either side, for more guest rooms, social spaces (the modern designer, Zaha Hadid, did the new bar) &amp; wonderful gym facilities. True luxury &amp; architecturally fascinating at the same time. We had a great week-long stay in March. The location was excellent--near 3 tube stations &amp; many restaurants, yet quiet (we stayed in a room facing the courtyard garden, but I think Portman Square would have been quiet enough &amp; the room might have been brighter). Our room was very big &amp; very comfortable (ditto the bed) &amp; we had everything we needed (&amp; then some--mini bar, complimentary whiskey &amp; gin (!), slippers, etc.). Breakfast in the lovely, bright restaurant was always elegant &amp; nice, and the one dinner we ate there was quite good (try the rice pudding dessert). The staff were always exceptionally friendly, helpful, &amp; enthusiastic--it was really lovely getting to know them while there. The club atmosphere just means the place is friendlier, more intimate (without being in any way intrusive). Not being members, we wondered if we'd feel uncomfortable or unwelcome haunting a private club, but we never did. There's a lot of social energy, but no palpable snobbishness. After regular hotels, this was a golden opportunity &amp; experience and made our London stay unforgettable. Especially if you appreciate aesthetic &amp; historic elegance, try this as an alternative to modern hotels."
3,838,"Apr 28 2007 	The potential is there	Home House is a private members' club mostly used for its dining, drinking and conference facilities. HH also has 17 guest rooms which are available to members, guests and people &quot;known&quot; by the staff or management of HH.We spent two nights at HH and all in all this is a fine place to stay in central London. The location is fantastic, about 100 yards away from the bustle of Oxford Street, yet in a refined and fairly quiet neighborhood. The building itself was converted from several very old buildings and is beautiful, but is a warren of hallways and byways. It took us about a day to get our bearings and not get lost. The lift looks like an ancient contraption but seems to be safe and efficient.All of the rooms don't have numbers but are named after famous people, i.e. we stayed in &quot;Sir Anthony Blunt's Room&quot;.The room itself overlooks the fairly quiet back courtyard and is of palatial dimensions with the largest bathroom we've ever seen in a hotel. The room had a mere two fireplaces.The mattress set is manufactured by Savoir beds (as in Savoy Hotel) and probably the most comfortable we've ever slept in. The room is furnished with antique (or antique style, we're no experts) furniture and thus has the usual ups and downs - great to look at, but not functionally ideal. We experienced things like wobbly night tables, missing closet door handles, uncomfortable seating etc.The shower was great with a dinner plate size shower head, high water pressure and really hot water. We didn't use the freestanding cast iron bathtub. I guess the the two separate water taps in each of two sinks is a matter of taste.The air conditioning is fairly quiet but not very effective. It was barely sufficient for April, I would doubt if you would be happy in mid summer. Of course you could open the ancient windows if they don't jam and if you are willing to put up with residual racket (sirens, alarms, deliveries etc.) floating over during the night from Marble Arch.The biggest issue was the service. The gentleman who checked us in (Farouk) was excellent. The chambermaid also was very good. Many of the other staff were a bit ineffective and preoccupied with other things. Small matters like wake up calls, getting taxis or drink orders were forgotten. The check out process (due to a new software being installed) took quite a long time.The members themselves tended to be loud business types who use the club for hard selling and hard drinking, so the bars and restaurants were not the quiet haven we had hoped for after a long day in London.Food and drink were reasonably priced for Central London and of excellent quality.In sum we were very happy with HH. It could use a bit of polishing and then would be a great alternative to the classic grand hotels."
4,838,"Nov 26 2006 	Old fashioned elegance combined with gracious manners.	My husband and I stayed here for one night only, as we were attending a dinner of old school friends in the city. This hotel was recommended by a colleague of my husbands, who is a member of the club. We had a delightful room on the fourth floor overlooking the park. The room itself was enourmous, with a giant bed that was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The ajoining bathroom was also a huge size, with a wonderfully large bath, and separate room with shower. All in marble with his and hers sinks. We had breakfast in one of the lounges, and I can honestly say that the staff here were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble and they all knew who we were and were most gracious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to be treat as an individual and enjoy the oldfashioned graciousness of a bygone era."
5,838,"Jun 22 2004	Really Palatial Hotel	We stayed at Home House (Sept 2002) during a mid-week 4-day getaway for some theatre in the West End, London. Since our flight arrived early and our hotel room was not ready for us, we were upgraded into a 3-room suite on the 2nd floor of the hotel overlooking the front entrance of the hotel and the park across the street. We had a living room with fireplace, enormous bedroom with fireplace and an enormous bathroom with marble and lion-footed bathtub and amenities galore. The staff were marvelous! Fresh fruits and flowers in our suite during the 3-days we stayed. The Concierge recommended 2 very different restaurants each evening - one of them being the adjoining hotel dining room. Food was fantastic, and they geared the time to serve the meal to the opening time of the curtain at the theatre we were going to that evening. Being a travel agent, I had one of the staff give me a tour of various rooms and can tell you if you rent one of the &quot;ordinary rooms&quot; you will feel like you are the owner of this palacial building. The inner courtyard gardens can be used for private functions and is large enough to include a tented structure for more formal large parties. When I have clients looking for a hotel in London - this is the first hotel I recommend. Depending on your budget, this hotel will make a lasting impression on you for many years to come. It is unequaled to any hotel I have ever stayed in over the 40 years of going to London."
1,841,Nov 23 2009 	Looked good but not very accommodating	I was due to stay at this hotel on business but the event was delayed by one week. Hotel refused to move date and charged full fee even though I guaranteed I would stay the next week. Staff not very helpful in this scenario. Business users beware.
2,841,"Nov 5 2009 	Convenient comfortable and good value	We stayed here in October for 4 nights before heading to other parts of England to visit family. We were delighted to find the Heathrow Connect service stops at Ealing Broadway which turned out to be less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel. That meant we were at the hotel within 30 - 40 minutes of leaving the airport. We arrived early in the morning so handed our luggage over for storage and went out sightseeing. When we returned we found our luggage had been transferred to our room. We had paid the supplement for a garden room which actually overlooked the roof of the breakfast room, but being at the rear of the building avoided any possibility of disturbance from traffic noise. Rooms here are small, but extremely well apointed and very comfortable. The website advertises &quot;king size beds&quot; - maybe England has a different definition of king size to Australia - it certainly wasn't, but was very comfortable anyway. The bathroom was tiny, but had the best shower ever, positioned over a full size bath squeezed into an alcove. Hot water, good power, large fluffy towels and nice toiletries.Our room - as well as the public areas - was spotlessly clean and well maintained. We even had our carpet cleaned one day!The included breakfast was very generous with a choice of cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit, toast, meats, cheeses, pastries &amp; croissants and kept us going all day. All the staff we encountered were very friendly without being intrusive, and made our stay very pleasant. We didn't eat in the restaurant at night, but did visit the small local Italian restaurant round the corner which served enormous meals at very good prices. We also noticed several other restaurants close to Ealing Broadway station, but didn't get back to them. Being so close to the tube was excellent and the staff at the station were friendly and helpful with ticket advice. We found it very easy and convenient to get around from here using an all day off peak ticket (cheaper after 9.30am).If you had a lot of luggage, or were planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel then this might not be the place for you, but for somewhere to put your head down in clean, comfortable surroundings after a day of sightseeing this hotel would be hard to beat for the price."
3,841,"Oct 27 2009 	Nice place for a city trip in London!	The hotel is about 20 minutes (by subway) away of the center of London but is easily accessible! The style of the hotel is nice, typical lounge atmosphere! Staff were very friendly and heplfull for finding restaurants and using the subway. The rooms are in the same style and very clean. In the hotel there is also a Japanese restaurant but we didn't have dinner over there. In the same restaurant you can have breakfast and it was good. Also because the room gives you a restfull feeling and you have a nice view on the beautiful garden. There is only one problem, don't book a room on the street side because this side is somewhat noisy due to a lot of traffic during the night and the 2 rooms on ground level have even more trouble with noise due to the reception that is just aside!"
4,841,"Oct 1 2009 	Stylishcleanfriendly and cozyfeels home!	I visit London very often in a year,this was my best stay ever! clean and beautiful! professional staff,very , very friendly would do anything to make your stay pleasant ! nice breakfast,great garden to enjoy,all facilities you need for business or leisure definitely the best hotel to stay in London!"
5,841,"Sep 28 2009 	Reasonable for a short stay	I've just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel 55. I travelled alone to attend a course / conference near the hotel. I stayed in a &quot;cosy room&quot;, the smallest room type. It cost 70/night B&amp;B, booked direct with the hotel. My room was ready when I arrived, located on the ground floor. It was very small - probably about 3 square metres, and almost all the floorspace was taken up by the very comfortable double bed. It is, after all, a &quot;cosy&quot; room. They make reasonable use of what room there is; a flatscreen TV is on the wall in front of the bed; there's a wardrobe with safe and fridge inside, and a small desk with kettle, tea/coffee etc. There's free still and sparkling water too. The bathroom is small but again makes good use of space; the water pressure is great (too good in fact - I got soaked when I turned on the tap to brush my teeth!). The shower cubicle is oversized (good) and there's Molten Brown shampoo, shower gel etc. I slept quite well though I did hear some noise from the room next door both nights (I'll spare the detail of what the noises were). There was certainly no traffic noise and no door slamming, footsteps upstairs etc to be heard. Breakfast was good both days, with cereal, meats / cheese, pastries, toast, fruit juice etc to choose from. The restaurant is very tastefully decorated. I ate there on the second evening and again it was good, albeit I was too tired to pay much attention. There's a patio area behind the bar / restaurant area but I didn't go into it. Reception were very helpful; an internet code was produced immediately on asking, and they booked taxis for me both mornings. They also delivered an iron to my room, and on the first morning it was delivered at precisely 7am, which they'd agreed to do the previous evening.In summary this was a good base for a short stay in the outskirts of London. The room was a bit too small for more than one person and would probably have become a bit claustrophobic had I been staying much longer, but for a weekend it was absolutely fine. The amenities, decor and breakfast were all satisfactory, and for this price in London it represents a very good deal. Recommended."
6,841,"Sep 16 2009 	Great out of city center location	Hotel is clean, perfect for a short stay outside London. nearest Tube station is 2 minutes walk, limited parking is available, not sure of the options if the parking is full."
7,841,"Aug 18 2009 	Great hotel and service and defenitly recomend it	It was one of the best hotels that i stayed in Europe. The staff is very freindly and helpful. They welcomed us and we were able to keep our luagage at the hotel until the chekc in-time. The room is small but it's very clean, it served the purpose of spending the night there. Breakfast was inlcuded in the price which amazed me b/c none of the other hotels in europe inlcuded breakfast. It was a small open buffet but very delicious. I rememer i wanted a croisant and there was no more left and right away within 15 min they made a whole bunch of fresh ones even though breakfast was almost over. The had a free internet and computer available.Location wise, it's couple of minutes away from one metro stationa and like 15 min away from another metro station. It's also 15 min away from a lively area, which has restaurants, pharmcies, stores and coffe shops.Overall it was a great experince and i wish all the other hotels do the same, it's a small hotel but very nice enviroment with very nice staff. They also have a patio if you want to have your breakfast out there."
8,841,"Aug 12 2009 	Nice und cozy - Liked the Service	Once your sitting on the tube it doesn`t matter, if it`s ealing or not.The next tube station is just a two minute walk away.The hotel itself is really welcoming.Really nice and open stuff, who are really pampering their guests.We arrived there pretty early, our room was ready within a couple of minutes.While we`re waiting, we enjoyed a cappucino in the nice lounge.I really liked that.The room itself was small (but ok!) but poshy enough for me.The beds are adorable.We had a really great weekend - not just because of the hotel, but it helped a lot :)"
9,841,Aug 8 2009 	Modern Cozy Place to Stay	The hotel feels like a U.S. bed and breakfast due to what appears to be a renovation of a couple adjoining houses. The rooms are small but very clean and nicely kept. The bathroom was small but in excellent shape and the shower is very powerful. There is a continential breakfast each morning with excellent wait staff.The hotel is about 1-1/2 blocks from the North Ealing tube station and there is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel.
10,841,"Aug 5 2009 	Convenient and attractive	Stayed here two nights and would definitely recommend it if you need to be in this area. Very convenient for Kew Gardens and for Heathrow by the nearby tube station. The room was tiny but stylish and clean. I got an upgrade (which seems to be common) to a garden-facing room for 80 pounds. Free wifi was great. The Italian and Indian restaurants around the corner were convenient and good. Both had big groups the nights I was there, so locals obviously like them."
11,841,"Jul 27 2009 	Convenient and a good value for the money	My wife and I recently visited the UK and this is the place where we stayed during the fifth night of our trip. Once we found the place, the biggest issue was finding parking. The hotel has no onsite parking but being London we expected parking to be an issue. Luckily the East Ealing tube station is pretty close to the hotel so we were able to park there for the duration of our stay without any problems. It was also very convenient to stay somewhere that is so close to a tube station.The hotels dcor is very modern and trendy which made it attractive. Check-in was easy and the desk clerk was very friendly and was kind enough to give me change for the parking meter. Walking to our room was quite difficult however because there where large stacks of bags of towels all thought the halls which had to be climbed over at times. I thought to myself at first that they were probably just doing their rounds cleaning the rooms, but the bags were there during our whole visit, so I guess that is just where they store them which we thought was kinda odd.The Room was VERY small and essentially had just enough room for the King sized bed in it so you had to climb over it to get to the bathroom and there was no room at all to put your luggage. Still, my wife and I agreed that it was good that they didnt sacrifice the quality and size of the bed for more walking space because the bed was the most amazingly comfortable bed that Ive ever slept in. It had both a feather down mattress and comforter. The bathroom was small too and the sink didnt work very well, but the shower was nice with great water pressure.The hotel includes breakfast which is nice and convenient. It wasnt too fancy but it was perfect for our needs. Checkout was quick and easy and the desk clerk in the morning was just as friendly as the one the day before.All in all a pretty good place to stay."
12,841,"Jul 16 2009 	Very Comfortable Excellent Value	Stayed here for one night early July to attend concert at Wembley. We chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed. After staying in London hotels previously, it was a nice change to find the hotel exactly like the pictures, very clean and modern, easily accessible by road or tube. Staff were friendly and helpful, Breakfast the usual continental, good choice of cereals, bread and pastries, juice, yoghurts, tea/coffee etc. Our room was small but adequate for the short stay. There was a fridge in the bedroom and a safe. Thoroughly recommended."
13,841,"Jul 6 2009 	This Hotel Rocked	We chose this hotel for a 2 night stay ,when we went to Hard Rock Calling at Hyde Park, based on trip advisor reviews and weren't disappointed. We paid 85.00 per night and had a well decorated garden facing room with bath and powerful shower over it. The bed was very comfortableEverything was spotless and the staff were friendly, efficient and helpfulThe continental breakfast was nothing special but adequate and we ate it in the lovely garden as the weather was so goodWe managed to get one of the 4/5 parking spaces outside the hotel, but there is very cheap parking at the Tube station which is literally just round the cornerWe tried the Italian restraunt by the Tube and the food &amp; service was very good.All in all a great find at a reasonable price and we will certainly stay there again(Hard Rock Calling was amazing - esp. Bruce Springsteen - what a great weekend!)"
14,841,Jun 28 2009 	Hotel 55 - reasons to be cheerful	Three friends stayed in Hotel 55 and were amazed at the service and quality of this boutique hotel. Nothing was too much of a challenge and the friendliness of the staff was wonderful.Thank you for a wonderful stay.
15,841,"Jun 8 2009 	Very nice indeed!	Just got back from a long weekend at Hotel 55 for my boyfriend's birthday and we were really impressed! Booked through their website and got 3 nights (Friday-Sunday) B&amp;B for 220 which was a bargain compared to similar options I'd looked at. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the garden and was spacious enough - although it did get very warm at night and we couldn't get the air con to go any cooler! Nicely decorated room, comfy bed and small bathroom with very powerful shower! I think I'd recommend getting a garden facing room on the first floor - these seem to be the more spacious, quieter and cooler rooms. The Wi-fi worked no problem.Breakfast is perfectly adequate and the service at the reception was excellent. They were very helpful and one member of staff even offered us his umbrella when we were going out to a restaurant one evening in the rain!It's really close to North Ealing station, and the trip to Oxford Circus (fairly central) takes about 45mins. We'd also recommend the little Italian restaurant round the corner (near the tube station) - massive portions and great service at a very reasonable price.All in all, a really good place to stay, we enjoyed being a little further out of London and will definitely be going back!"
16,841,"Jun 7 2009 	Small classy hotel very comfortable	We stayed overnight here on a trip to the theatre. Easy to find by road, very straighforward route, off the M1 at the bottom turn right, keep going for approx 2 miles and at Hanger Lane roundabout turn left and the hotel is about a mile or so down here on the left. It is approx 1 min walk to the tube station where you can park for about 2 for 24hrs. There are 4 spaces outside the hotel, we managed to park there! The picadilly line goes straight through to covent garden and takes about 30 mins. The hotel is small but quite classy with modern decor. Our room was quite small but very adequate , flat screen tv on the wall, hospitality tray, safe, very comfortable bed, and although the shower room was small the power shower was great! Very friendly staff, and a very adequate continental breakfast. The garden was lovely, and as the weather was great we could eat outside - very peaceful. We obtained a room rate of 85 and overlooked the garden. We left our sat nav behind and the staff posted this back to us and kept in touch by e mail to inform us of postal arrangements. Altogether a very pleasant stay, and we would definitely return again if visiting the city, no complaints."
17,841,"May 29 2009 	cosy good convenient hotel	Stopped here one night after I located a 90 deal on Laterooms. It did the job. Only 4/5 car parking spaces - there is an NCP at the North Ealing tube station (2.20/day). Picadilly line about 30 minutes to Picadilly Circus, but quite infrequent trains in the morning (could have walked 10 minutes to the central line though). Location for car was OK - right on the North Circular. If you're coming by car, you MUST approach from the north (A40, hangar lane gyratory) or you'll find it impossible to turn in. Room was v cosy indeed - not comfortable for anything other than sleeping - extremely minimal working space for business travellers. There was free wi-fi which was great since the Vodafone signal strength was zero. Overall rating - good, but not great for the business traveller."
18,841,"May 27 2009 	Great little place off the beaten track - worth it!	I loved this place - we stayed just one night for a romantic getaway even though I live in London. It was really nice to see a new area and compared to some the 'Top Secret Hotels' this place is much better.Rooms lovely (we were on the top floor so a little hot), some traffic noise from the main road but we slept through it and the restaurant was AMAZING.Great for 80 including breakfast and the staff were lovely too! Ver impressive overall, but not central London so watch out for the tube back if you want to go out (although the Central line does run right in so no changing needed)...my advice - book and enjoy!"
19,841,"May 23 2009 	Comfort luxury and style for a reasonable price- perfect for romance.	My partner and I stayed here for two nights for our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised. The rooms are modern, comfortable and decorated beautifully (the photos on the website are very accurate) with one of the comfiest beds we've stayed in. The bathroom had an excellent power shower, with enough cupboards, surfaces, drawers and wardrobe space for everything we brought.Cleanliness was to the highest standard throughout the hotel, with all fittings and decor looking brand new. We were impressed with extra touches like a small flat-screen tv, bottled water and a really powerful (and controllable) air-con system. The entire place had a very luxurious yet cozy feel, especially the Japanese restaurant downstairs and lounge which (although slightly pricey) has an enviably cool atmosphere. The garden was the perfect location for a romantic evening drink, despite the cold weather. We had booked a double street-facing room and were upgraded to a garden facing room for no cost, giving us a lovely view, with complete silence for the entire night.Some queries have been raised about the location, something that we had no problems with. It is a 2 minute walk to North Ealing Station (you can't miss it), and with only one change for places like Euston or Camden Town you can get to central London in 30 minutes or so. It's ideal for staying in London, without the hustle and bustle of the city when you're trying to sleep. There is a local pub, a takeaway, Indian Restaurant and newsagents all on the next road, with a mini-supermarket that stays open late if you need anything. We traveled to Camden on both days and found the trip to be pretty straightforward and better than other reviews had suggested. It's also very close to Wembley and Earls Court. We highly recommend the Italian restaurant that is a minutes walk away, it was intimate with excellent staff, very cheap and served the best Lasagne i've ever had.The only criticisms were trivial, such as no room service and a pretty lame hair-dryer, nothing that stopped us from having a brilliant time. I'm not sure if it's really ideal for families due to the sophisticated ambiance and the fact that at 20 we were the youngest guests. It is perfect for couples and ideal for friends or business if you want a treat.Overall, we found a modern hotel that for a reasonable price combines an air of luxury with a cozy atmosphere and personal touches. Not too far away to travel for night's out and sightseeing but far away enough for a secluded romantic getaway and to enjoy a quality London hotel without paying over 100 a night. We're booking for next year already!"
20,841,"Apr 15 2009 	Excellent small hotel good price for London	My wife and I stayed at Hotel 55 for 4 nights and then again for 2 nights (after taking a short trek to Wales). We wanted a more reasonably priced hotel with good proximity to a tube station and feel we got everything we wanted with Hotel 55. The rooms are very trendy and clean and very quiet (especially at the rear of the building). The free continental breakfast is quite good and filling enough. North Ealing tube station is just a quick 3 minute walk away; the only inconvenience is that it's not on the primary Piccadilly line from central London to Heathrow. This is only an issue when you're heading west - you have to wait for a train to Uxbridge (which tends to be a little less frequent). But for us, this was never a problem. The only caveat about this hotel is that some of the rooms are very small - primarily the four rooms that are furthest towards the back of the building. We had one of these on our first stay and there really wasn't much room to move around the bed. Our 2 large suitcases had to be stacked on top of the 'closet' unit to have some room (good thing I'm 6'4&quot; so I could lift them up there!). On our second stay, we had a bigger room that was much better (it was on the side of the building, not the back) and more comfortable. I'd easily stay here again, but I'd absolutely request the slightly bigger rooms if I'm not traveling alone.If you're driving here, like we did, there are 4 parking spaces out front, so that may or may not be a problem. A couple of pluses for the neighborhood: there's a couple of small markets and local restaurants within a 1 minute walk and even a launderette which was really convenient for us to do our laundry."
21,841,Mar 16 2009 	Good Hotel - Handy Location	My girlfriend and I went to Wembley Arena for a concert recently and as she is pregnant we decided against a long and late journey home and instead looked for a hotel fairly close by. I chose Hotel 55 based on tripadvisor reviews and was very glad I did. The hotel had limited parking so we decided to take the train. The hotel was located a stones throw from North Ealing tube station which meant a fairly comfortable journey to the Arena particularly as you find yourself travelling in the opposite direction to the majority to the thousands of others who also travelled via rail. The hotel was clean and well designed and the staff were helpful. The room was small but adequate for the 1 night stay. Breakfast was included and was of good quality. Overall i was pleased with the stay and if I was to attend another concert or sporting event at Wembley I would look to use this hotel again.
22,841,"Feb 25 2009 	Fantastic staff and handy location	I stayed here for a weekend having driven down from Manchester. Access to the hotel is perfect - easily accessible from the A40 and easy to find on Hanger Lane. Parking wasn't a problem even though there were no spaces left at the hotel. We parked in North Ealing tube station (1 for 24 hours!!) without a problem.The room was smallish but adequate and decor was lovely - the place was spotless. Bathroom was also really well thought out with a fantastic shower!! I was concerned that there would be road noise but I slept like a log with no noise whatsoever. Breakfast was continental with a good choice and really friendly, efficient staff. We didn't have dinner there or use the bar - Ealing is within walking distance with a wider selection of eateries and bars. A real find I think!!"
23,841,"Feb 3 2009 	New London favourite...	Don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect but it does have some very good points that easily outweigh the bad ie. :-It's free parking - which in London is nigh on impossible to find. The downside is that there is only space for 4 cars and the hotel has 25 rooms. Get there early!The location is spot on too. A two minute walk to North Ealing tube station in a smart-ish area (so no scary walk back after a night out on the town!) and there are a few shops, restaurants and a pub in walking distance.The room is modern and well equipped (fridge, safe, TV, phone, hairdryer, tea/coffee, aircon/heater, free WIFI). The dcor is smart and the bathroom and shower terrific.There is a nice garden area that would be a lovely place to have coffee in the morning (though it was snowing when went so we just had a quick stroll and then rushed back inside to get warm!)The reception staff are extremely pleasant and friendly.Ok, the negatives:The safe didn't work - I asked three times for it to be looked at but it remained inoperable.The breakfast service was slow and the food limited. On the second day, we waited 20 minutes for a table to be cleared  only to then be told to hurry as the breakfast period was about to finish! On the third day, there was no bread at breakfast - meaning the choice was limited to cold meats, cheese (both pointless without bread) and cereal.The room, although modern and pleasant, was on the small side and the bed 'sunk' into the middle.The WIFI signal was so weak as to be worthless - even sat right next to the router.Actually, thinking about it, the negatives are quite trivial and certainly didnt put me off.One thing that did bother me though was the pricing. When I looked at the usual places to book, the price was coming up at around 95 per night - but this was reduced to 85 when I emailed the hotel to ask for their best rate. Indeed, the reply I received assured me that this could not be lowered any further and I should confirm by email as the hotels own website booking facility was down. Out of interest, I checked their page and found that the booking facility seemed to have fixed itself  and was coming up at 75 a night!That aside, there is little to fault and I would certainly stay again when visiting London.Oh yes, nearly forgot, the bar is smart and modern but extortionately priced. There is a pub round the corner thats about half the cost for drinks. The pub itself is part of a chain doing 2 meals for 8 kind of deals. Lets just say the head chef and cellar manager wont be headhunted any time soon.As for proper food there is a Japanese restaurant in the hotel (Momos) but we didnt eat there  preferring the little Italian opposite the tube station. Lovely food, service and ambience and the starter (tonno e faggio) and the maincourse (calzone) could have fed the entire hotel!"
24,841,"Oct 4 2008 	Great hotel great location	My wife and I stayed there for a week while visiting London. The hotel was a 3 minute walk from the piccadilly line, with easy access to downtown and all of London's hot spots. The hotel staff was very friendly and they had a nice breakfast available every morning."
25,841,"Sep 29 2008 	Good value for the location	This was originally a large house, which has been successfully renovated into a nice comfortable hotel. They have made a real effort to keep some of the original features of the building, whilst installing a contemporary modern dcor. They have managed this very successfully. The bedroom and bathroom was of a small to moderate size, however it was very clean and the room had some nice touches. The bed was very comfortable and a good size. The employees were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast was of a good quality but small in choice. The bar is expensive even by London standards. If you want to stay in this particular part of London you will not find a better hotel for anywhere close to the same price. It knocks the spots of the national chains of hotel, which are priced similar. I would definitely go back."
26,841,"Aug 31 2008 	Fantastic hotel highly recommended!	What a fabulous little hotel! I cannot fault it in any way. - it is very nicely decorated throughout- lovely garden, with decking and tables/chairs- all the staff are really helpful, friendly and efficient- the rooms are nicely presented with some great extras like a mini-fridge and a hairdryer- the beds are really comfortable - we slept really well both nights we stayed there- excellent continental breakfast included in the price - great choice and eat as much as you like- close to North Ealing tube station (just round the corner)- great pub also round the corner (The Greystoke) with very reasonably priced food (2 meals for 8), plus a few other nearby restaurants including an Italian and an Indian- about 10 mins from the town centre with some nice shops- just over an hour's walk to Wembley StadiumWe spent two nights there and would definitely go back if we ever go to London. We loved it and would highly recommend it."
27,841,May 24 2008 	A deal at 89 pounds	A clean stylish hotel with a 24 hour bar and nice continental breakfast. It's less than 2 minutes walk to North Ealing Tube. Also convenient to Heathrow- its about 30 Minutes by tube on the Jubilee Line. We visited from California for the FA cup semi final and FA cup final. Both times we stayed at Hotel 55. We stayed up all night visiting with friends in the 24 hour bar. It's was a great base for events at Wembley as it is on the bus line direct from Wembley. I would definately stay here again!
28,841,"Apr 13 2008 	A very pleasant surprise	We stayed for 3 days in a double bedroom, the hotel is situated 3min from North Ealing station, 20 minutes from the city's center. The neighborhood seems a quite almost countryside place, there is a pub (&quot;the Greystoke&quot;) with great prices. The hotel has a garden and a lounge/bar (the guy at bar made us the best margharitas I ever had...). - the room was nice, clean, had its own shower and toilet in a separate room, plus a view of the hotel's garden. 3 nights booked at laterooms.com were at 270 pounds.- the staff was very friendly, we were even lent for free a UK to continent power adapter.-the price included a breakfast (choice of meat, cheese, fruit salad, orange juice etc.) One disadvantage was the poor acoustic insulation of the rooms, one could hear in the morning guests slamming doors, in the evening (faintly) someone's TV..."
29,841,"Mar 27 2008 	London's Best Kept Secret	We stayed at Hotel 55 for our honeymoon in London. Yes, it was a tube ride of about 25 minutes to the city center, but the tube station was only 2 minutes from the hotel (we really didnt feel the time). It was beautiful, especially breakfast in the conservatory. The staff was friendly and helpful. I considered this a very trendy hotel, in a peaceful neighbourhood. The bath products were Molton Brown, which were very chic and upscale. The bedding was soft and welcoming . Our bedroom was on the second floor and overlooked the garden, it was small but perfect. I am going to stay there again on my next trip to visit the Queen."
30,841,"Feb 28 2008 	Perfect base for a trip to London	Me and my Boyfriend stayed here for New Year. It very easy to get to but limited parking. We were greeted at reception by a friendly guy who showed us to our room. When we got to the room it was very small so we asked to be moved. The receptionist gladly moved us to a much better room without any hassle. The deco is very modern and fresh. The rooms were very clean (which I'm very particular about!). The tube station is literally round the corner and took about 15mins to get into London. This hotel is great value for money, especially for London.Would recommend family and friends to stay here and would return in the future."
31,841,Jan 25 2008	Very clean and right beside north ealing subway	was on a business trip so had a room to myself...the room was small but all i needed...very modern decor and the bathroom was really nice..breakfast was continental - but a very good selection..its location was ideal as i was workin in chiswick area near where the hotel was.. great access for LHR airport.
32,841,Dec 31 2007 	clean	rooms are small but nice and spotless. if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room but want a clean place this s a great hotel to stay in.
33,841,"Dec 9 2007 	Above Expectations	We stayed at the Hotel 55 for several nights in late November. Our room faced the garden so it was away from the road noise. Although the rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are first rate, the beds and bedding are very good; however, there is not much storage for clothing. The location is far from the center but there are three tube stations within a 10 minute walk and a bus stops directly in front of the hotel. Considering the price of hotels in central London, the Hotel 55 was a bargin. In the immediate area of the hotel is a nice Italian restaurant and a neighborhood pub. The breakfast is more northern European than British, cereal, bread, meat, cheese and juice, it is served buffet style so the quanity and variety make for a filling breakfast. The staff was fine and accomodating when called upon. During warmer months, there is a fine garden just off the breakfast room. Parking, five spaces, is available at the front of the hotel."
34,841,"Nov 29 2007 	Expensive for an hotel with so many cons!	We stayed at this hotel for four nights in October. Its far from the center but with an underground stop just 2 minutes away we are 30 minutes away from the main attractions. The neighbourhood is nice but the road in front of the hotel is quite noisy. Upon arrival we were given a smoking room that smelled terribly and had views to a wall just one meter away from the window. During the night we could hear a very disturbing noise every eight minutes yes, I timed it because the smell and the noisy didnt let me sleep! In the morning, I asked to be changed to another room which was more pleasant but extremely tiny - we could hardly pass between the bed and the wall. Also, wireless Internet didnt work in that room so I had to go to the hallway or to the restaurant to download emails and use the Internet. The design of the hotel is nice, although not spectacular as some of the reviews say, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We exchanged several emails before the stay and they were all answered quite promptly. Breakfast was fine but tables are very uncomfortable. It seems like we are having a picnic instead of a meal in a restaurant. So, the restaurant is nice if you dont plan to eat Nevertheless, the garden and beer garden are beautiful and quiet. I wish we could have enjoyed it more."
35,841,"Nov 1 2007 	Smoky hotel is not designed for comfort	I have to stay that I am very disappointed with the hotel, I expected so much from the reviews and it just did not deliver. When we checked in we were placed in room 3, which was tiny, stank of smoke, had the light fitting with live wires hanging off from the ceiling and 3 lights were out. The room had no natural daylight and overlooked a wall. When i informed reception the receptionist proceeded to try and fix it by placing his hand inside with the live wires. Eventually he gave up and moved us to the disabled room at the front of the hotel which was noisy from the traffic and reception but better then the box room. Again the room was missing the attention to detail, no conditioner or body lotion, no iron or ironing, only 1 pillow each no spares, the kettle did not work, no place to hang wet towels, the sink was to close to the toilet, no manual for the hotel. Breakfast was nice but would be better with the option of a cooked breakfast. This hotel has a lot of problem mainly the smell of cigarette smoke that a new hotel should not. it is pleasing to the idea but is not built for comfort."
36,841,"Oct 11 2007 	Wonderful stay	From Sydney AustraliaWe stayed at Hotel 55 for a total of 9 nights over a period of two and a half weeks. We had 3 different rooms and couldnt fault any of them. Our first room was at the front of the hotel on the busy main road and didnt find that a problem at all. Continental breakfast was excellent and ample, we certainly had our fill. The staff was helpful and friendly. Heard others say that the hotel was out of the way but we found that transport and anything else we wanted was practically on our doorstep. Sure you had to change trains to get to North Ealing Station but the hotel is only around the corner. Central London didnt take any time at all to get to. Buses run from outside the hotel to pretty well near everywhere. Ealing Broadway is only 5min ride with some pretty good shopping. We would certainly recommend the hotel and we would stay there again.Thanks to all for a wonderful stay."
37,841,"Sep 20 2007 	Beautiful but far away.	Hotel 55 is a charming little hotel that seems like its in the middle of nowhere. To get there, you need to take a 30-minute ride to North Ealing from central London, on a train that doesnt seem to come along very often. But if you want to be in west London or dont mind the travel, Hotel 55 is a great place to stay. Our room was spotless and very well-designed  with deep brown furnishings and a soft white bed  but a little smaller than we thought it would be. It had a good shower, and the Molton Brown products were a nice surprise. The hotel also has a nice conservatory and garden, along with free parking, free wifi and a 24 hour bar. Breakfast was excellent , a huge spread of breads, cold cuts, cheeses, juices and cereal - all neatly packaged and laid out in the conservatory. The staff was very helpful  the manager even let us use his personal laptop to access the internet. Hotel 55 is just like a boutique hotel, but slightly cheaper (we paid 80 pounds a night for a double room) and a little out of the way."
38,841,"Jul 31 2007 	Would stay again.	We picked this hotel as it is close to my daughters home and we were having a family party. The website pictures and the positive reviews on here helped to make our minds up and we were not disappointed. The hotel is in a strange location, straight off the very busy Hanger Lane Road which is very busy at all times but once inside you could forget the fact you are in noisy London. There are 2 tube stops nearby both get you into central London in about 20-30 minutes. The decor is very calming and the finish appears to be very good. The rooms are a bit small but the very comfortable mattress and pillows gave us 2 very good nights sleep. The air con was efficient and quiet. The bathroom was small but again the power shower and complimentary moulton brown toiletries were very welcome. The staff were helpful. Breakfast was better than I expected, good choice of fruit, yogurts, meat, cheese, cereals etc. The garden and outside seating area were very clean and well laid out and if the weather had been kinder we would have sat out. I would have no hesitation in staying again and would recommend this hotel if you need to be in this part of London."
39,841,"Jul 11 2007 	Good value and clean	Stayed for 6 days than 4 days in a double room on the top floor.The hotel website pictures accurately reflect the hotel decor. The bathroom was small but perfectly clean, with Molton Brown products.Room would have been small for 2 people for the length of time I stayed.The garden would have been nice for an evening drink if the sun had been out! (5.65 for a glass of nicely chilled rose wine).Wifi access is free but restricted to the ground floor bar and dining areas (well I couldn't detect it on the 2nd floor).Room for 4 cars on the hotel carpark, however, there is ample free overnight street parking around the corner. And the tube station is only 200 yards away. All in all perfectly acceptable, and I would stay again."
40,841,"Jun 23 2007 	Strange location but fab hotel	You don't expect to find a hotel gem on the North Circular in West Acton but Hotel 55 turned out to be a stunning surprise for us. We booked in for one night to go to the theatre - only 30 mins on the tube to the West End on the central line. Efficient and polite receptionist. Clean, but trendy, room with an extremely comfortable bed - lovely, pristine white sheets and pillows. In addition, the shower was powerful and roomy with gorgeous Molton Brown goodies. Breakfast was served in a minimalist, tranquil garden and rounded off a perfect stay. Highly recommended."
41,841,"Jun 18 2007 	Great Little Hotel	We stayed at Hotel 55 for one night on 16 June. On arrival we managed to bag one of the free parking spaces located at the front of the hotel, there are only 4 spaces available so we were very lucky.Check-in was very easy and straightforward and we were given room 204 on the top floor. The room was a good size with a comfortable double bed, wardrobe, easy chair, flat screen tv, safe, tea &amp; coffee facilities and airconditioning. We had a view of the large well-kept garden at the rear of the hotel. The ensuite was lovely, very contemporary with a large power shower. Molton Brown toiletries were a nice touch. The room was very quiet due to it being at the back of the building, away from the road.The hotel's main eating area is great, with a bar and separate lounge area. Breakfast is continental only (no full english) but it was very nice with a good selection of food, cereals, fruit etc.The train station is literally a 2 minute walk around the corner of the hotel, and there's a selection of little shops plus a pub which does food in the same vicinity.Our stay was to visit a concert at Wembley Stadium. The hotel is approx. 3.5 miles away. We had taxi to get us to the stadium which cost 13 (the hotel reception arranged this for us), and we walked back afterwards, which was quite a trek and took about an hour!We would definately stay at this hotel again for both visiting Wembley and visiting Central London (20 minutes away). A lovely hotel with very helpful staff."
42,841,"Apr 11 2007 	Rooms not ready on arrival too far off extremely noisy during nighttime!	We stayed at Hotel 55 for one weekend (two nights). We arrived at about 4 p.m. on our first day. The lady at the reception was quite friendly and handed us our keys. However, we were very surprised when we first got into our rooms. They were both not cleaned!! So we had to wait for about another 20 minutes for the rooms to be cleaned. Secondly it takes about 40 minutes to get from the city center to the hotel. That is why we expected it to be in a calm area. However, our two rooms were facing a very busy street so we could not sleep at all. Also the staff at the hotel-bar was unfriendly. All in all this hotel was too expensive keeping in mind the service, the noise and also the location. We would not stay there again!"
43,841,"Mar 22 2007	Great value for the money	This hotel was completely renovated 9 month ago so everything seems brand new. I'll try not to duplicate the posts before me because they were all accurate. Free internet access was important as I needed to book show tickets and such. Some hotels charge up to 14 quid per 24 hour period for this. There is a laundry with bundle service, two small grocery stores and a great pub(Greystoke?) less than a block away. The phones are VOIP and it only cost .15 per minute to call back to the US. That was cheaper than my mobile phone. Some rooms are larger than others so if room size is important then check the floor plan. We chose a garden facing room (less noise) but they are smaller."
44,841,"Mar 5 2007 	Lovely boutique hotel 	Stayed here for three nights, its a lovely hotel, clean and chic with comfortable beds and great shower, the staff are very friendly, we asked to change rooms because our shower was cold and we had a room on the busy main road and the traffic noise kept us awake, but they moved us to a room at the rear with no problem. Only a 2 minute walk from north ealing station and about 25 minutes into central London. There is a lovely italian restaurant near the station called Vila Toscana, the food is excellent."
45,841,"Dec 8 2006 	Very Nice Small Hotel	Stayed here for three nights for our wedding anniversary. Enjoyed our stay here very much. Our room overlooked the garden and was lovely, although quite small. Everywhere is very clean and well maintained. The decor is superb and very tasteful. The bed was fantastic, so comfortable with huge soft pillows and a magnificent duvet. Breakfast was continental and ample. The dining room and bar are very stylish, the only gripe i had about the place was the bar prices, i know its London but these were expensive.A special mention must go to the staff who were superb, nothing was to much trouble and because it was a small it seemed more personel. The tube station was 2 minutes walk round the corner and about half an hour to central london. Highly Recommended."
46,841,"Nov 29 2006 	Great Hotel!	What a place to stay, Really clean, wonderful friendly staff, and the rooms are out of this world.. Lacking slightly in TV Channel selection, but if you don't stay in, you won't notice. Just booking another stay, as its in a great location and has the right facilities I need (free car park &amp; free wifi!)"
47,841,"Nov 13 2006	Good value stylish and convenient	On Hangar Lane, just round the corner from North Ealing tube (Piccadilly line) so convenient for getting into central London. It's a fairly nondescript house on a very busy road, but once you get inside everything has been furnished with good- though just slightly OTT- tasted and is quiet, restful and clean. Staff were pleasant and helpful all through our stay.Our room on the first floor was small but well decorated: flat screen TV, great power shower, fridge, welcoming bottles of still and sparkling water.24 hour service meant we could have a beer after getting back from our Wembley concert (no. 83 bus takes you virtually door to door in about half an hour) and the continental breakfast was fresh and tasty the next morning. At 75 for the room and breakfast this was great value."
48,841,"Nov 9 2006 	Fantastic value and amazingly stylish	I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights on business. Great staff, excellent rooms, Philip Stark eat your heart out!!. The owners have done an excellent job at making the hotel staying experience more than just a cheap room. This is a 5 star experience for 3 star prices. Will come again."
49,841,"Nov 8 2006 	Excellent Getaway Hotel	My partner and I stayed in Oct based on it's location and reviews from Trip Advisor. We weren't disappointed at all. It is a very stylish, cosy hotel with great staff. We needed somewhere not far from London and close enough to Gatwick and we really wanted parking as I had a lot of stuff in the car that I was going to leave overnight. Parking is free which is also a bonus. Only a short walk to Ealing Broadway which has great restaurants and shops. The tube station is literally a minute's walk away not that you would know it. We went to the hotel website direct which had the cheapest rate of 75 pounds. With brekkie included this is a real bargain. The beds are comfortable but business kingsize literally means double or maybe queen. The rooms are small but everything has been cleverly decorated using space saving furniture. Our room overlooked the back garden which was beautiful. If we had stayed in summer it would've great to sit out on the decking...maybe next time"
50,841,"Oct 22 2006	beautiful hotel friendly staff	Me and my boyfriend went to London in Septembre 2006.  About Hotel 55:+: stylish lounge room, great breakfast in a beautiful room, comfortable bed, power shower, very friendly staff (they really do everything to help you), ...-: the trip to central London takes you about half an hour by underground, the hotel is situated very close to a station though.  If you go to London and you stay in Hotel 55, you won't be disappointed!"
51,841,"Oct 6 2006 	I entirely agree....	I entirely agree with the other TA member. Excellent value small hotel with the emphasis on comfort and style. Since it is situated on busy Hanger Lane it might be wise to ask for a room at the rear, but we slept well in our room at the front directly above the front door.The upside of the location is that it is a very short distance from the tube station on the Picadilly line and is very easy to find. Limited (free) parking at the front. A quiet, leafy and safe neighbourhood.Helpful and well-informed staff, good (continental) breakfast in a lovely room, beautiful and large garden, super-comfy beds, power shower. What more is there to say?"
52,841,"Aug 15 2006 	Good stylish clean hotel	We were visiting London for a concert at Wembley and found hotel 55 on lastminute---, as it is situated roughly between the West-end and Wembley. The train station (North Ealing) is just round the corner where the picadilly line takes you north towards Wembley or into central London. The hotel itself was 75 per night for my partner and me including continental breakfast (they don't do full english). The building is newly renovated to a high standard. It is a large Victorian (I think!) building with many original features still, such as stair case and stained glass windows. The large conservatory, bar and gardens are stunning and a pleasure to spend time in. The staff were freindly, approachable and polite and we would definately stay here again, especially for wembley."
53,841,Aug 2 2009 	Pulito moderno molto carino
54,841,Dec 19 2008 	Superbe htel dans coin tranquille juste un peu loin du centre
1,844,Aug 25 2009 	Great find	Decent budgethotel at a good price and an excellent location. Staff friendly except the girls in the breakfastroom who didn't care very much. Triple room was not very big but we had a nice bathroom with excellent shower. Would go back on a next citytrip to London.
2,844,"Aug 1 2009 	Welcome to the Hotel California	I thought htis hotel was an excellent find. close to Kings Cross St Pancras. we stayed in a room sleeping 6 adults (yes, not restricted to 2 adults 4 kids!) remarkable value for the 5 of us that stayed for 22 each!ROOM: in the basement. amazingly quiet when you consider the station is literally 200yds away. clean, recent refurbishment but still a little shabby if you looked close enough. small wardrobe, 4 drawers. BED/BEDDING: Clean and fresh. wooden, box built beds all of which were fairly comfortable. 1 towel per bed. HOTEL OVERALL: warm welcome at reception, shown to our room, offered for us to sit in lounge when we arrived back at 2am, but no bar so declined! (hehe). missed breakfast so can't comment, but smelled nice and the people in the room above said it was delicious!"
3,844,"Jul 26 2009 	terrible experience	we had a tiny room at the top of the hotel, no lift and narrow stairs, difficult getting case to room. mattress was ripped and dirty and extremely uncomfortable. complained this was removed. no soap in toilet. wardrobe doors could not be opened fully due to doors opening on to bed. will not be staying there again."
4,844,"Jun 7 2009 	Good Hotel for my budget.	I used the California Hotel on a short weekend break, only 2 Minutes walk to St Pancras.On our arrival we meet with a very friendly receptionist that direct us to a room on the second floor overlooking the street, the room had a proper bath, tea &amp; coffee facilities with ceramic cups, Free Wireless internet. full english breakfast served in the restaurant and a little terrace for the smokers.Overall very enjoyable i can certainly recommend for anyone looking for budget accommodation in the area"
5,844,"May 26 2009 	A JEWEL OF A FIND !	I have just returned from an overnight stay at the California - brill find for a budget hotel in central London: friendly,helpful staff, a reasonable residents lounge area with a little outside patio adjacent to the lounge - perfect for quiet moments in which to savour the sun - if you are lucky ! I booked a single room which was a very reasonable size (in fact it was a twin) I had a full bathroom with both bath and shower and plenty of CLEAN white towels. I also had a little tray with a kettle, tea, coffee etc in my room..a small portable TV was also in the room (though I never watched it - so unsure about quality of reception) The breakfast was well cooked and adequate: self service: bacon,sausage,beans, eggs, toast,cereal and juices together with hot drinks were available......Lets get real here DO NOT expect 5 * luxury this is a budget hotel but as I said an absolute gem of a find ...Footnote: Maybe not suitable for people with young children or anybody with mobility problems as there is no lift, so I had to struggle up four floors of steepish, narrow stairs with my luggage - but this did concern me at all and I would definately book again. I believe there are some not so nice rooms down in the basement but if you end up with one of these maybe it is your own fault..when I made my booking I requested a clean and quiet room and that is exactly what I got ...Fab !!"
6,844,"Apr 24 2009 	About the same stayed here previously.	Stayed for one night. Booked a twin room to be used as a single.The hotel was clean and check in was fast and easy.The room was a good size with the usual amenitites.The room I got was in the basement, and u can hear the underground trains until about 12.The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean.The heating worked and there was loads of coffee and tea.The toilet and bathroom was seperate, which is great if two of u were using the room.The bathroom had a powerful shower but it was a bit dark.The TV worked and reception was good. Breakfast was buffet style and full english. Tasted good and food was plentiful. I wish there was fruit however. But prompt service.This hotel has no WIFI.Overall I had a good night sleep not too noisy.But u can't beat the location, loads of eating places and the tube is a stone throw away.So I last stayed in this hotel 3 yrs ago, good to see that it hasn't deteriorated.But if I stay here again I would ask for a room thats not underground."
7,844,"Apr 10 2009 	Travelers be warned	No hot water six of the seven mornings. Room and bathroom were not very clean. They never had more than a surface cleaning. The wife was very uncomfortable. The management thought fixing the problem was to clean the shower head. I explained to the repairman, as a retired commercial building contractor, the problem was the guest ratio to water pressure and heating ability ratio was inadequate to keep heating water and pressure. They made excuses when I asked for some money off that the manager was not coming in that day, her normal work day. Our wives had to wait till 9Am to take showers, which was when the water heated up and the pressure came back, thus missing breakfast. Us guys will go unrepresentable but few ladies will. The way they represent themselves as a hidden treasure at Kings Cross is not quite accurate. I am president of Christin Fellowship Churches Inc. and we went there with the intention of finding a place to send ten ministry couples every six months for sabbaticals. I even told the manager this and what they gave us was the best they can do? I think the basic that should be expected isn't new but clean rooms, sheets, and hot showers. I know London is an expensive city and rooms are small but as a person that travels two weeks of the month for the corporation in this capacity I can say with some experience this is a one star hotel with a three star breakfast. This is the truth and I warn travelers. Yes you get what you pay for but this is not what we thought we were paying for or represented as. This is not a place for reconnection and intimacy between couples. I didn't expect an five, four or three star hotel but clean and hot water isn't too much to ask. I was just going to let it go but it wouldn't be right. I think the management should contact me and make some kind of amends for other travelers and restitution. This is not a Mom and Pop business. This is owned by the Moreno four star hotel just around the corner. These are professionals and we should be able to expect more from them. I don't mean to be harsh I just think there should be a change."
8,844,"Mar 9 2009 	Don't bother	Booked a long weekend here with my partner after having being well looked after on numerous occasions at the California's sister hotel, the Montana Excel.What a disappointment!The rooms were basic with an en-suite, as expected. However, our rooms were not cleaned at all during our stay other than the bed linen being subtly re-arranged and the shower head was appallingly filthy. Refreshment sundries were not replenished and the lack of a bath mat meant there were quite a few close calls getting out of the shower.The temperamental heating, poor TV reception, non-functioning clock radio and the staff's disbelief at us asking for an ironing board (which never materialised) only further added to our irritation. Breakfast fayre was standard but in three days we were only asked if we wanted drinks on one occasion- the rest of the time we had to attempt to find a member of staff, which was no mean feat.To top it off the staff were either rude or mute at best, we were charged an extra 15GBP on top of the price quoted at booking which they would not back down on and we didn't even get a thank you or goodbye at any point during our stay! So, to sum up: over-priced, scabby rooms in a tired hotel that's seen better days and where the staff do not appear to understand the concept of good customer service. The only good thing about the place is the proximity to the Tube stop. Stay at the Montana Excel around the corner or the Premier Inn a little further up from King's Cross station."
9,844,"Jan 27 2009 	exactly what I expected	I stayed at the California Hotel with my mother and teenage children, it was cheap, and much better value than a room at a Travelodge or similar as it included breakfast. The room was basic but clean and comfortable enough for a few nights. My mother is in her late sixties, and she found it comfortable enough."
10,844,Jan 5 2009 	You get what you pay for.	Stayed here last month as most people have said the location is ideal. On arriving it was pleasant enough then I was shown to my room which was down in the cellar where the cleaners kept things. Though the bedroom was ok double bed and a single bed tv and en suite bathroom which was freezing.The real downside was where the room was situated I hardly slept a wink through the noise and banging all night and come breakfast I thought that was included in the price was going to be charged 8 so declined.On the whole it is pretty cheap price for london but I doubt I'd stay there again
11,844,"Jan 1 2009 	Wouldn't have stayed here longer or on a family trip	We stayed here for one night for a works do that was arranged locally. Excellent location, right next to the Tube station.The rooms were very basic, the bathroom was very small and compact.I was staying with a close friend which was just as well, as you didn't really have much room to get ready.But hey - I was there for somewhere to crash after a heavy night of alcohol, and it was extremely acceptable for my purpose. However, if I was staying in London with family or needed to stay for any longer I would not have chosen this hotel.Breakfast was excellent though, and very welcome. Staff were also friendly. For the cost what do you expect?? It was clean and for one night I would happily stay here again if a similar party was organised."
12,844,Dec 2 2008 	would not stay here again	family from California We stayed for 2 days . The bathroom was cold and the carpet old and dirty . There were no mats on the bathroom floor. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.
13,844,"Nov 30 2008 	dont bother	I booked to stay at this hotel for my birthday in November....i booked April 14th 2008.On arrival at the hotel we made quite welcome &amp; given the keys to our room.On returning to ythe hotel at 10-45 we were told you are not staying here,they tried to tell us that we had been doubled booked,all our stuff was behind the reception waiting for us to collect.They said they had booked us into the the Jurys Inn on Pentonville rd,they gave us our money back &amp; made up the rest to pay for the new room.We were then sent into the night like homeless people roaming around to find the new hotel which was a good walk away.I booked for B&amp;B but the new room was room only so no breakfast for us unless we wanted to pay some ridiculous price,the actions of California hotel really spoilt my birthday &amp; i certainly wouldn't ever book to go back there."
14,844,"Aug 27 2008 	Cheap and Cheerful!	We arrived at the Hotel California and was greeted by a friendly woman on reception. She checked us in and had no problems. The hotel room was tiny, with a double bed and a desk. There was no coffee/tea making facilities in the room. The bathroom was clean but very basic. We were only staying one night for a quick weekend away together in London. We weren't after anything plush or luxurious, just somewhere to rest our head and in a good central location which is all it is.The hotel is situation basically across the road from King Cross Train station which was great for access to the Underground and getting home.All in all, this hotel is not the best, but if you are looking for a central place that is relatively cheap to rest your head after a days shopping or sight seeing then I would recommend here."
15,844,Jul 14 2008 	OK for a night	Liked the tiled-floor public areas and good buffet breakfast. Single room was tiny and cramped but was survivable for a one-night stay. Convenient location near Kings Cross.
16,844,"Jun 21 2008	Poor value for money	I stayed at this hotel for 2 separate nights on the way to and from Belgium on the Eurostar, the location was ideal as St Pancras international was a 2 minute walk away. From the outside the hotel looks inviting and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. I was accompanied by my 83 year old mother which made getting up 2 flights of narrow stairs difficult, TV reception was awful and whilst the bed linnen was clean and fresh looking I could not say the same for the carpets and the room smelled of stale smoke, beds very uncomfortable. Our second night was to be 3 days later and although dubious we did not have much choice about staying here because at 83 my mum didn't need dragging round London looking for an alternative, I asked at reception if we could have a ground floor room on our return and the guy on reception was very helpful and swapped us to the ground floor from the 3rd floor, on our return the same things applied smell of stale smoke, pokey room with bad TV reception.Breakfast was poor and we didn't even bother the second time, the staff in the breakfast room were surly and unfriendly.All in all I would not stay here again and would not recommend it to my friends."
17,844,"Jun 11 2008	Good and Bad	We checked in early, received a friendly welcome and were allowed to leave our luggage in the store room until check in time. Stairs were very difficult to manouver with anything but hand luggage or for anyone a bit out of shape. I had a small single room at the front facing the street. The room was hot and noisy. The window was broken off it's sash and had to be held open with a roll of toilet paper, definately a two man job. The mattress was hard and lumpy and I had the same towel for four days. On the good side there was a pleasant breakfast room, good breakfast, free wifi and friendly staff. There is a small terrace out back for smokers. The location couldn't have been better and the price was right. I would not stay there again nor recommend it to others. If the owners would invest in refurbishing, opening up the bar for evening cocktails and improve cleanliness this hotel would be a gem."
18,844,"Apr 24 2008 	Don't go!!!	Arriving and looking from the outside this hotel looked lovely once you got inside you soon see why most of the reviews are correct. It's small, dirty and smells foul. When they were cleaning our room while we were out they left the door wide open with all our belongings in it, so it was open for all to see and pinch whatever they liked!! They didnt make the beds or give us fresh towels so what were they doing in our room, as we locked it when we left. It's small inside with tidy rooms and corridors, with very creaky floors we were woken up most morning with doors being slammed. The bed mattresses were about 3 inches thick, very uncomfortable and very worn, the beds were tiny for single ones and the room smelt of smoke and body odour! The only good thing about the hotel was the nice reception staff. I wouldn't advise anyone to stay here!! We took photos to put up on here but unfortuntely they didnt come out properly - sorry!"
19,844,"Mar 19 2008 	Great location. Don't go if you are picky.	Good things first: the location is great! Tube station is basically 1 min away. Kings Cross is not the most glamorous area of London, but the connections to other parts of the city or other cities are excellent. I usually have troubles sleeping in London because of the traffic noise, but the streer was seriously quite. Major plus in London.I've booked a double bed in the single room, so the bed was good, so was the heating in the room, which you can control yourself. Very handy. Wireless worked perfectly! Very important if you are on business.Now the bad things: the hotel is a freaking maze! I honestly got lost the first time I went to my room. Avoid if you have heavy massive bags and no lifting power. There is obviously no lift and the stairs are super narrow and steep. The building itself and the rooms seriously need renovation. It is old and it shows. Decor in the rooms was all right, good colour choice, but OLD. I'm not gonna get into the broken power sockets and terrible shower head details. They are pretty common in the hotels of this rank. What surprised me the most is the breakfast. I love English breakfast and it was one of the reasons why I booked the hotel. It was the worst English breakfast I've ever had in my life! They have a really cute breakfast room and a terrace and you'd expect to spend a few pleasant moment there, but the food was absolutely horrible: everything from the paper sausages to the week old &quot;juice&quot;. Even the eggs were awlful. Such a shame.Staff is strange. I didn't really need any extra help, so wouldn't know how helpful they are, but they are certainly strange. I am seriously NOT a picky traveller, but this was one of those rare times when I said to myself: wow, I really don't want to spend any extra time in here, and I didn't."
20,844,"Dec 14 2007	would not stay here again	We arrived to a friendly greeting, however once we negotiated the very narrow stairs which were fairly grimy and went through the door to the corridor to our 2nd floor room we were initially met with a smell of stale cigarettes and body odour. Once in our room which was quite small, the carpets were threadbare and the bathroom so murky we actually just had washes as we could not face usuing the bath. The guests in the room above us were walking about until 2 am and kept us awake due to the load creaking of the floorboards. There were also some loud drunken guests on the same floor banging doors.The breakfast looked as if it had been out and kept warm for about 3 days the eggs were so hard you could have used them as pucks on an ice skating rink.We were so glad we had a full itinerary for our London trip so we spent as little time as possible in the hotel. On checking out the receptionist has us down as staying for 3 nights and not 2, if we had booked for 3 we would have left after the first night!We will not stay here again."
21,844,"Dec 5 2007 	good location bad beds	The hotel has very small rooms and very un comfortable beds. It was clean and close to Kings Cross. The shower head didnt work, but the rest of the bathroom was fine. Never received clean towels but had to ask for them. Staff was friendly and had an English breakfast (the same selection every day)."
22,844,"Dec 4 2007 	It all depends...	ConsI booked a single which was a mistake. For 10 more, a double with single occupancy would doubtless have been better.Dangerously narrow, steep stairs( large luggage out). Despite booking 2 months in advance for 4 nights and mentioning difficulty with stairs, I was on the 2nd floor.No phone in a tiny room like a cabin with a bed like a bunk (only 80cm wide). To get to the WC you need to go through the shower cubicle... Overhead, fixed shower: too bad if you don't have a cap!Only one towel for 3 days! No bath mat. Sheets changed every 3 days (is this a hotel or a hostel?). Very bad TV (only two working channels) perched high on a shelf guaranteed to give you a crick in the neck if watched for any length of time. Never fixed or changed despite repeated complaints.ProsGenerous amounts of tea and coffee in bedroom. A good, grilled, full English breakfast in buffet style (all you can eat). Pleasant dining room and bar. Busy, efficient staff. When the reading lamp bulb died it was replaced by a brand-new lamp. Everything looks spick and span. So as I said, it all depends on what you want from a hotel room for 50 in central London..."
23,844,Nov 24 2007 	Its good enough	I was pretty nervous after reading some of the bad reviews but we found this hotel okay for the price. it was 70 for our double room plus travel cot which is good for london. the room was small but clean. the man on reception was so friendly when we checked in and so were all the staff. Breakfast was good and checkout problem free.its not the ritz but noone has paid for the ritz. We chose it because it was close to St Pancras as we were going on the eurostar. Its a 2 minute walk there.my parents said their room was cold but ours was fine.I'd stay here again and I'm quite fussy!
24,844,Nov 22 2007 	loved it	just returned i feel i had to write a review after reading the others posted we stayed here for 2 nites the hotel is 2 mins from kings cross on a quiet road we stopped on the ground floor and had no problems with the noise in fact there wasent any as said in the last reviews the hotel was full we had a small room very clean bedding was crisp whiteroom cleaned evey day lovely hotel and staff all i can say if you want a good hotel at the right price book this one if money no problem then book the ritz ps the breckies self service ad good
25,844,"Nov 7 2007 	great : ]	I stayed here in January 2007 and thought it was excellent. The room for the money is great - it was clean and fairly comfortable and had a good bath room. The location is great ( 2 mins from Kings Cross Tube) and in a quiet street. We stayed there as we were going to a gig at the Scala and it is 5 minutes from this venue with a few nice pubs around to get food in.The hotel is a bit of a maze to get around...but we all felt this added to the fun of the place!I would definately reccomend this place to anyone wanting a clean, safe, friendly hotel on a budget."
26,844,"Oct 22 2007 	Most Hideous Hotel ever!!!	Booked into this hotel for a friends birthday treat, turned into a nightmare. It is the most rundown, awful, filthy place I have ever had the misfortune to step into! We said we didn't like the room and were offered several others which were all the same and the staircase leading to them was stained and threadbare carpets which looked like rats had been chewing on it. The rooms had polystyrene drinking cups and the beds sunk in the middle one, was just a sofabed rather than a single too and that was worst of all, it must have been years old. The windows didn't lock and we were not allowed to keep our keys, we had to hand them in, this is awful when you have personal belongings in your room. We told the receptionist we could not stay there and he would not give us our money back and was extremely rude. He then gave me my money back but proceeded to process my bank card without my permission to get the money back. I am going to do everything in my power to get my money back even if it means going to court. An absolutely horrendous place, the receptionist even admitted that they had exaggerated on websites etc about their hotel and said it was companies who we booked throughs fault for not checking that the details were correct. AVOID at all costs or be warned. After much searching we found a lovely hotel round the corner, called the Princess Hotel, what a difference and it was cheaper too!!"
27,844,"Oct 9 2007	Good clean bargain	When my passport came up missing on Saturday morning I was to leave UK, I had to stay over three days.This hotel offered me a good clean safe haven.My room was comfortabl, clean and cheerful. Staff friendly. Breakfast more than adequate. Bathroom exceptional.Enjoyed the marble lobby where guests gathered.Appreciated the location, convenient for both tube and bus.So the rooms are small? Even 4 star hotel rooms in London small.Yes, I would stay here again."
28,844,Sep 30 2007 	Good location/service but be aware of bed bugs!!	Stayed at California Hotel. Room was small but adequate for returning at night time whil we explored the town. Good location near Tube station. good breakfest and staff friendly. One neg note: we found a couple of bed bugs and my wife sustained several bites! Be aware thought that this is common in European hotels
29,844,"Aug 15 2007 	If You Like To Shower In A Closet	Thread bare carpets, dirty, grimey, generally not pleasant. We walkedinto our room which was tiny. The double bed took up most of the floor space!! The tiny TV was INSIDE the wardrobe &amp; the reception is so poor you barely get 1 channel!! At first we thought they hadn't given us an ensuite room until we realised what appears to be a builtin wardrobe is actually the shower &amp; toilet!!!! The door to the &quot;en-suite&quot; is a slatted wooden wardrobe door - not exactly private!! The mattress was thin, lumpy &amp; uncomfortable - we had a dreadful nights sleep. The breakfast was awful &amp; they gave us shot glasses for orangejuice!! I wish we had gone somewhere else. A complete rip off for the70 they charged us for one night - it will be Travel Lodge for us next time!!!"

31,844,"Aug 7 2007 	Cheap and cheerful	The California is an average B&amp;B, but in a great location for tube travel.Ok, the rooms are small, but they are clean and light. We booked a twin room, which consisted of 2 single beds, TV, a wash basin, wardrobes, a safe, and a separate bathroom with shower and toilet. There was also tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Bed linen was clean and towels also. Breakfast, if you are up early enough, (7am-9am!) is not bad, the usual bacon and eggs fry up with tea and juices.There was a small outdoor courtyard with benches towards the rear of the hotel for smoking or sunbathing.I found the staff to be friendly and helpful, and we were able to leave our bags in a locked storage on the day of our departure.We stayed for 2 nights over the weekend for a concert at the o2 arena and a days sightseeing and found this to be an excellent location for getting the tube all over london, and also only one stop from Euston for when we were going home. I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again."
32,844,"Jul 25 2007	Cheap Clean and OK - but small pokey rooms	I have stayed here a few times since i first wrote a review, and my views have changed. Maybe its because i have stayed in a few different rooms, and they all seem small, cramped and a just a little bit too tatty. For 50/night its OK, and not quite dirty, but doesnt feel like the good value i first thought - maybe its me just changing my views.Stayed in a Travel Inn as an alternative, much larger room, clean bright etc, but at 100+ per room per night its nearly 2x the price, and you dont get free internet in Travel Inns.Right now I need to book again for a couple of weeks time, cant decide wether to rebook the California or not? (mind you, its not really my money I am spending, so the cost is less of an issue than it might be.)"
33,844,"Jul 11 2007 	Basic good location ok for a base.	I'm just back from a 4 night stay at the California Hotel and it was ok.I had a single room and I was travelling with 3 friends, one of them had a single room and the other 2 had a double.Location - Excellent, it is directly across the road from Kings Cross tube station. There are cash machines, a post office, various shops and eateries round about the area. Staff - Were fairly friendly, I didn't interact with them all that much aside from checking in and out and handing in my key and gettingit back when we were going out for the day. They weren't chatty or anything, just done their jobs really.Foyer/Lobby area - Very clean and nice appearance. There is a computer terminal with internet access but it was out of order during our entire stay. It is possible to get coffee here and they also have a little back garden area. There is also a stand with lots of leaflets for London attractions, check them out because some have discounts on them which is handy.Getting to the room - this involved climbing up stairs in fairly narrow staircases. This was no problem to me but if stairs are a problem to you I'd see about asking for a room on the lower down floors.My room - My room was utterly tiny but it wasn't like I was planning on spending a great deal of time there so that was no big deal..The width of the room fit a single bed pushed against a wall with about a 2 foot space from the side of the bed to the other wall. The lengthof the room was from the top of the single bed to the bottom with about another 2 foot gap at the bottom. The 2 foot gap at the bottom had a built in wardrobe/dresser/mirror where there was space for a suitcase, clothes to hang, plenty of hangers, tea and coffee making facilities, a tv and a safe. There were no instructions for use of the safe but I went down to ask and they showed me how to do it. The side of the room that the bed was pushed against there was a radiator and a window which could be opened easily. Next to the bed there was a little shelf which held an alarm clock that had seen better days and a lamp.My room was located at the front of the hotel and whilst this is the side nearest to the main road I can't say the noise of traffic bothered me in the slightest.The bathroom - The bathroom was pretty small but adequate. It has a small bath with a shower, a toilet and a sink. There was extra toiletpaper, 2 little bars of soap and one towel. The towel was the size ofa hand towel so if you prefer a bigger towel either check if they canprovide this or bring your own. Water pressure for the shower was fine and the temperature was good unlike some hotels I've been in.Cleanliness - General cleanliness of the room seemed ok, the bathroomwas clean apart from the bottom door frame where it looked like coffee had splashed on there at some point. The room carpet looked like it could maybe do with a clean. The curtains smelled a bit foosty and the window was in dire need of a wash. Otherwise the sheets of the bed appeared to be clean and the surfaces were dust free.Friends single room - he was on the 4th floor above my room and he said his room was ok, his was a little bit larger than mine but his shower room wasn't so great. His shower consisted of walking into a small toilet cubicle with a shower head sticking out of the ceiling meaning everything in the toilet gets soaked. It was a pretty small cramped space too. Although we were aware that this could be the case from reading previous reviews on here.Friends double room - they say it was small, clean and basic. They were kept awake by some guests who were making noise out the back of the hotel in the early hours of the morning but that was the guests and isn't the hotels fault. In their bathroom the toilet handle fell off but they told the people in reception and it was fixed when we got back later that day and worked better than it had before.Breakfast - My friends went for breakfast but I didn't go near it as I don't like full english breakfasts but my two friends went and I was told it was very greasy but adequate. I'm told breakfast consisted of cereal, toast, sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatos, tea and coffee. Price - for a single room I was told 50 a night via email and that is how much it cost. However, it does say on the website that a room with a single bed is 45 and it's one with a double bed that is 50 so they've got a bit of a web discrepancy going on there. The pricesdisplayed in the hotel match with the 50 a night price though. The double room was 70 per night.What isn't included - shampoo, hairdryer (but you can borrow one from the desk), telephone, instructions for the safe (but you can go ask how to use it).What would make it better - the rooms are painted in a nice yellow colour but the curtains, bedspread and carpet are patterned and a bit dowdy looking. It was also terribly hot in my room even with the window open a little fan or some kind of air conditioning would be good. A breakfast with lots of fresh fruit.Overall impression - I think this hotel made a good base for exploring London and for the money you can't really go wrong. The location was very good, we didn't explore the area very much but it'sgreat for the tube. Yes the rooms were small but if all you need it for is a place to sleep and get washed then it's fine. It makes a good base and I would go back to the hotel."
34,844,"Jun 30 2007	Most basic hotel we've stayed in	This was one of the most basic hotels we have stayed in. We stayed in Room 302, which was extremely small. When we booked we rang to specifically ask for a room with a bath, but only got a shower. When we complained about this at reception, the response was &quot;well, you're not staying at the Ritz at 500 a night&quot;, and we were told that some rooms have a bath, others don't. We were given the impression that it was the luck of the draw to get a room with a bath, so we felt we had been mis-sold on this.There were no toiletries in the room, not even a bar of soap on the washbasin, and we only had one towel each. The shower needed a good clean, on the bottom of the shower cubicle door there was something brown and gross, and under the basin tap lever it looked pretty manky too. In the shower cubicle there was no shelf on which to put one's toiletries, luckily I found a plastic carrier bag and hung this on the shower control and used this to hold my shampoo and shower gel. The shower itself though was powerful and hot. There was no holder for the toilet roll on the wall, the loo roll had to sit on the floor.There was no hairdrier in the room - one had to ask for one at reception, and it turned out that there were only 3 in the whole place, so it had to be returned after use. If you are staying here be sure to bring your own toiletries and hairdrier!The general cleanliness of the room was not great - cleaning seemed to have been skimped upon, the carpet needed a good vacuuming.The two men on reception were helpful, but did fail to mention available facilities such as internet access in the lounge, and we were not given any instructions about how to use the safe, which was in the wardrobe. Breakfast was ok for those fond of full English, but limited in other choices. We were ignored by staff at breakfast, not shown to a table, and, as the basement dining area quickly got full, you needed to get down to breakfast early.Left luggage facilities seemed less than secure, with access to the luggage room being by a communal key.On the plus side the hotel's location is close to King's Cross/St Pancras/Euston railway stations, and there was a subway to the King's Cross/St Pancras Tube stations at the end of the street. There was a good Italian restaurant, Casa Mamma's, just down the street, in the shadow of King's Cross station.If you are only staying overnight in London and need to be near King's Cross/St Pancras stations, this hotel is adequate. However, if you are planning on staying longer, we would advise checking out one of the larger, chain-operated hotels in the area, where, for around 10 -20 more, you will get a more comfortable room with better facilities. In London, you get what you pay for."
35,844,"Jun 22 2007 	very basic and good value for money!!	Just got back from a wonderful four day break from London and i have to say i was a bit wary before we went after reading some of the earlier reviews about this hotel, my worries were unfounded as the staff at this hotel were very freindly, the room was very clean and basic, not the ritz i must add but if its only a base you need while your out everyday then this is the place to stay, with the underground just around the corner you cant go wrong, oh and the breakfast was very nice as well."
36,844,May 30 2007	Nice surprise	I spent five day on this hotel and considering the London standards and the relatively low rate they asked me I was very worried about it but it turned out to be a nice surprise. The room was very small and so was the ensuite facility but everything was clean and the room was serviced every day. Breakfast was in a nice room painted in pastel colours and there was plenty of food each morning. The staff was very polite and helpful. In addition the hotel is just a few steps away one of the King's Cross station entrances from which you can go everywhere you like in London. So if you are looking for a cheap but nice accommodation in a strategic location and you are not the Ritz type I definitively recommend this hotel.
37,844,"Apr 22 2007	worst hotel	I stayed at this hotel recently, the worst in my world travels, first - the room was not serviced, I mean the beds were not dressed, the towels were not changed or the bin emptied. There were no handtowels,or bath mat, no shampoo, soaps that had been used by others, and a safe that did not work, but worst of all no telephone, so I had to go all the way down the stairs to complain. There was no manager present. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I must say that the staff at breakfast were really nice and friendly, and the breakfast was adequate for me but no choice."
38,844,"Apr 19 2007 	Much better than I imagined!	I stayed here for 5 nights while on a course in London. The hotel was booked by my company and I wasn't expecting much as:1. They are a bit stingy2. The hotel is in Kings CrossThe hotel is about 200m from the train station, i'll let you decide if thats a good thing, but apparently KX is on the way up, and is nowhere near as bad as it used to be.I was pleasantly surprised to be honest, the outside of the hotel is well presented and the front desk staff were very helpful.I was in a twin with a double bed and a single bed, a decent sized bathroom with a bath and shower over. The room was cleaned every morning and the towels replaced. There was a safe in the room along with a wardrobe. There is free wifi which was a life saver!One thing to note is that other than soap there was no shampoo or shower gel etc (I travel prepared so was ok)From what I can work out the rooms are all being done up as there were some matresses and bed frames around. My room is one to still be done, it looked a bit tired, but was clean, which was the main thing!The lounge was nice, tastefully decorated, leading out to a well kept terrace area and there is a pc there for those without laptops.Breakfast is between 7-9 and is buffet style with mountains of toast, bacon, sausages as well as poached eggs, beans and tomatoes. There was some cerial as well and juice, tea and coffee. The room where breakfast is served is really nice and bright and with plenty of room.Overall I was pretty impressed with my stop here, it would have been nice to be in one of the newer rooms, but I imagine in a year or so once everything is finished it will be a really good hotel.The owner is really trying to make an effort with the hotel, and being in Kings Cross there is every type of food available close by."
39,844,"Mar 4 2007	Excellent Location	This hotel is very basic but if like me you had to pay for your own accomodation in London it makes you think twice. I usually stay in 100 per night hotels for work which are more luxurious but Hotel California has everything you actually need.The location is literally a 1 minute walk from Kings Cross / St Pancras tube and mainline station. This allowed me to check in and dump my bag and make it to my meeting 20 minutes later. It also meant after a night out I had a quick walk to the hotel from the tube so it was safe.I got a single room for 45, it was tiny but what more do you need than a bed, shower and kettle. The rooms have a tv and they leave you loads of tea, coffee etc more than most hotels. No hairdryer and the mattress had seen better days but the room, linen and towels were very clean.The bathroom - even tinier, small sink, toilet and a shower in the ceiling. It was difficult to shower in such a small space so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with mobility problems but again it was functional. It is a bit strange and obviously the floor won't dry quickly. Basic soap and loads of toilet roll left in your room. The only problem I had was the noise from outside but being near to Kings Cross you can't expect anything else. I didn't try breakfast but if it was ran to the same efficiency as reception then I probably missed out.Overall pros: Cost, location, refreshments, politeness and effeciency of staffCons: Size of rooms and bathroom"
40,844,"Feb 26 2007 	Great location and price	I stayed at this hotel last weekend and I would highly recommend it to anyone after a cheap but central stay in the city.Although the room I had was small, it was big enough for the 2 of us especially when all we wanted to do in the room was to change and sleep, (the beds were a little uncomfortable but i've slept in worse). The breakfast was great, you can help yourself to as much as you want and the staff are really friendly. The tube station is at the bottom of the street, only a couple of buildings away. I would definetly stay at this hotel again, and i'm already planning a second trip as we didn't get to all the sights in the city in a couple of days."
41,844,"Jan 19 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	we had stayed in London before at some very pricey hotels - this time we decided to try a B&amp;B in the Kings Cross area. What a pleasant surprise. At first we were leary because the rates seemed so reasonable, but decided that if we didn't like it when we got there , we could always spend a lot more and go elsewhere. We went to London by train and arrived at Kings Cross station -- Hotel California ( we discovered the owner is an Eagle's fan) is just across the street and 1 block down -- convenient to everything -- we had requested a quiet room and i must say - we were on the top floor ( a bit of a climb) but it was quiet, very clean, and big enough. The breakfasts were great ( buffet style) - the staff were friendly and very helpful--a great little lounge and back outdoor patio ( the weather was horrible while we were there, but i would imagine it would be nice to sit outside during the summer months). we would definitely stay there again -- it's not the Ritz or the Hilton -- but what a bargain.."
42,844,"Jan 7 2007 	Not generally friendly - Tiny quadruple	I booked a quadruple room at this hotel way in advance before december, and although I wanted a double bed, I agreed to take the one they could give me with four single beds (though it is not advertised on their website). When we got there we ended up with a tiny little room, the size of a double or triple (saw two of them) with a BUNK bed (and a foldaway one on top of that), for 4 of us adults ! On the hotel's website (obviously, would some say) their triple room doesn't look that small. When we told the receptionist we most of all didn't appreciate the bunk bed, we were told that it was what we'd booked... Eventually, we decided not to take it further and to squeeze in cause we knew the hotel was fully booked. But despite the small size of the room that you would generally find in &quot;budget&quot; hotels in London, I still think that a BUNK bed is something you should mention to your customers, when you don't belong to the youth hostels type !!!Besides, the room was overall clean, exept for the carpet which had burn marks and a few stains here and there. Also, they don't seem to have vacuum cleaners in this hotel... On the human side, only one of the four receptionists we saw was particularly friendly (but one of them turned out to be quite rude), and the staff at breakfast didn't look at you or answered your hello. One lady was even quite insistent. No need to say that in spite of the convenient location of the hotel, it came as a disappointment to me (even more as I had made the reservation for my friends) and thus I WOULDN'T recommend it."
43,844,"Nov 21 2006 	what a lovely place	We stayed here last week, we found the hotel to be excellent value at 60 per double room, the rooms were on the little side. The staff were very helpful and cooperative. The breakfast which was included in the price was perfectly adequate. Just a pity there wasn't any pink champagne on ice. Definitley go back, now we know its not down a dark desert highway."
44,844,"Jun 29 2006	Great budget hotel	Stayed here in late June for three nights. Because we extended at the last minute for the third night, we had to switch rooms. Both rooms were very nice (for a 60 GBP/night place). Rooms were clean and reasonable spacious. Beds were a little squeaky, towels a little rough, water pressure in the shower moderate in the first room, a little weak in the second. The rooms are not terribly soundproofed: you can definitely hear people walking about in the rooms above.For me, a big plus was free wireless internet access and an espresso bar (not great espresso, but good in a pinch). Never woke up in time for the English breakfast (7-9am),The staff at the front desk were very friendly, as well as the cleaning staff. I previously stayed at their sister hotel, the Montana, also in Argyle Square. While perfectly satisfactory, I did prefer the Hotel California (all things being equal, wireless internet alone would have decided, but I also generally liked the Hotel California better)."
45,844,"Jun 24 2006 	Nice Budget Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in May while on a business trip.I paid 40 per night and for that price, all I really expected and wanted, was a clean room with clean linen and an ensuite bathroom/toilet.I got all the above and more. The room was very clean and had a wardrobe with shelves and hangers, a coffee/tea making facility and a colour tv. The decor was acceptably nice.Furthermore, there was also a free full english cooked breakfast buffet every morning and free wireless internet was also available.Additionally, I found the staff to be polite, helpful and friendly.Negatives: 1. Too many stairs, no lifts and narrow corridors (especially awkward if you have heavy luggage and they shove you on the top floor).2. Staff smoking in the guest lounge area and behind the reception desk.3. Slow wireless connection, i.e. owned by the hotel but available to everyone in the neighbourhood as unsecured. Wireless is out of range above 2nd floor.4. No air conditioning or fans so rooms are hot in the summer!Overall, in cognisance to the price, my stay here was very good value and I would definitely recommend this hotel. I'm not actually staying here again for my next trip down to London though as I've plumped for a different hotel with air conditioned rooms. I'm paying twice as much for this luxury though. As they say, you get what you pay for, however, in this hotel you get a bit more for your bucks."
46,844,"Jun 12 2006 	Cheap and Cheerful	I stayed at the California Hotel for two nights recently when in London for research. Having read the reviews on this site, and knowing what 40 per night does not get you in London these days, I was a little apprehensive, but was pleasantly surprised by this hotel.Although I had booked a single for 40, I was actually given a twin for the same price, and this probably helped a lot, as the room, which would have been on the small side for two, was ample for one. It was clean and brightly decorated, with an ensuite with bath and shower. I did not have any problems with noise and was very comfortable there. I found the staff friendly and polite and the buffet breakfast perfectly passable. Not surprisingly, given the price and location, this place appeals to students and backpackers and that seemed to be the main clientele. The coffee bar was very nice, the internet access there overpriced, but very useful in an emergency (there are cheaper internet cafes nearby which can be used during the day). And free wi-fi throughout the hotel is an excellent idea, although the signal in my room, which was in the basement, was too weak to be effective.Kings Cross is not the nicest area of London, and this hotel will not win any prizes for scenic location, but if you want the convenience of somehwere to flop close to the main transport links, you could do a lot worse than this place."
47,844,"Mar 15 2006	I've worked for the rest but The California Hotel is the BEST!	I have worked for a lot of hotels -- Holiday Inns, Hilton Hotels, Sheratons, Marriotts, The Westbury in London -- and if you are looking for good value and a very reasonable rate, then STAY at The California Hotel in London. It is conveniently located across from St. Pancras Station, the rooms are clean with private baths, television and coffee &amp; tea self-service, the breakfast is hearty and good, and the staff are pleasant, friendly, helpful and informed. I stayed there for nine nights this month and was very pleased and satisfied. I know London very well and I walked everywhere from The California Hotel. If you are looking for luxuary, then go to a Hilton or Marriott and be prepared to pay PLENTY, but if you are practical and looking for a safe, clean, modest and very nice place to stay, go to The California Hotel. Deborah, the front desk manager, is a real professional -- welcoming and fun. I think it makes a lot of sense to the savvy traveller."
48,844,"Feb 28 2006	not bad	Stayed here for 2 nights in Febuary for 55 a night for a twin room we didn,t expect much. The room was basic,clean and tidy. Room 306, the bath was located under the stairs with shower attached which wasn't a problem for us but if you were taller than 5'4&quot; it maybe. Our biggest problem was the creaking floorboards above. Whoever was in the room above on our last night was pacing up and down from midnight till 2am as there were no telephones in the room we could not complain to reception without getting dressed and going downstairs which my 71 year old mother was going to do. I advised her not to as you couldn't be sure what sort of characters you might encounter at that time of the morning on the stairs. The stairways and corridoors were only wide enough for one person so you had to give way to people going in the opposite direction. In the end I resorted to banging on the ceiling with my umberella and they stopped, just wished I'd thought of it earlier.Breakfast was fine if you like a cooked breakfast only toast and cornflakes if you don't, served between 7am and 9am. Locker room handy for storing cases on day of departure as hotel is just over the road from Kings Cross."

1,859,Oct 11 2009 	Very small and basic	We made the mistake of reading reviews for Hyde Park Hotel not Hyde Park 'Court' Hotel:- Check in easy &amp; smooth- Staff pleasant enough- Room didn't smell very nice- Bathroom/ toilet tiny and smelt musty- Shower was very poor- Double bed was tiny in a very small room- Breakfast was basic but pleasant- Great location
2,859,"Sep 25 2009 	Not for the weak hearted	Myself and my husband stayed here for 4 nights this month and nearly died at the initial task of climbing 63 narrow stairs to the top floor with luggage. This climb is not for the 'weak hearted' and if you are not you could be after your visit. We were told we were upgraded to a family room....well when we walked in I wasnt too sure what a double would look like. It was very small for a family. Just an ok size room for a couple. The hotel itself smelt musty but was clean. Ensuite was a small box, dont expect to be able to move around in the shower or close the door whilst on the toilet. The mattresses on the bed were very thin and you could feel the springs as you slept, if I hadnt already paid for it we would have gone elsewhere. After 4 nights here I had severe back pain......Breakfast was adequate but on 2 occasions we couldnt be bothered waiting for the dining room to have a free table so ate outside.Location is good for travel around London on a short trip and also for access to Heathrow via the express or connect trains. As someone has previously written it is adequate enough but not comfortable and only for sleeping in, you wouldnt want to sepnd any time there other than sleep."
3,859,"Sep 23 2009 	Very Poor	I made the mistake of not reading the trip advisor reviews and everyone of the poor scores recevied is deserved.We were scheduled to stay here for one night before catching an early morning train to Heathrow from Paddington. It was a last minute booking having found the hotel on a blackberry search. Upon arrival we were allocated a room on the top floor and when you have no lift, plenty of luggage and a tight staircase it was not easy reaching the summit. The room and bathroom was dirty and smelt so we walked back down the stairs dropped off the key and headed to another hotel."
4,859,"Sep 8 2009 	We had a great experience!	Reservation was just as we requested - we got two quiet, connecting rooms. Rooms were clean and free Internet is a huge plus point. It is fast and very useful. Coffee making facilities, safety deposit box and iron in room are also plus points. The bathrooms are small but clean . Breakfast was great - lots of choice. One of the rooms had street view and although we had heard it could be noisy, it was actually very quiet and peaceful. We had a great experience!"
5,859,"May 22 2009 	The absolute pits	This is the worst London hotel I have ever stayed in - avoid, avoid, avoid. When we arrived, late at night, the receptionist had gone out and locked the door. We waited 20 minutes outside with a small child and baby and he was so rude when he returned. The public areas were tatty and dirty and the room was basic in the extreme. Our room, supposedly a family room, had two beds 'upstairs' and one at the bottom with a lethal, open tread spiral staircase in between - completely unsafe for small children. Staff were unhelpful and the room was overpriced. We didn't risk breakfast knowing it would be awful.There's an easyhotel a few metres away that would be a much, much better budget option."
6,859,"May 10 2009 	second time around not so good see previous review	second time of staying for us, not so good this time, different family room on front of hotel so a bit noisier at night but nice birdsong in the morning, beds and room about the same but toilet not so good, large hole behind wc and leaking from base of pan made it smell and look bit evil. Shower still great but no hot water until 18.00 which meant getting ready to go out was a bit of a rush, caravan type onsuite so still as cramped but seems to be standard for the rate, breakfast fine, just get down early otherwise you'll have to wait. Location obviously still great !!. TBH I spend as little time as poss in a hotel in LDN as I don't want to waste my valuable holiday time, as long as its basically clean and comfy thats fine, shame about the WC , otherwise it would have rated higher"
7,859,"May 1 2009 	Ever had a portaloo in your bedroom!!!	In brief, it no doubt once was a lovely Georgian House in a great area with massively high ceilings . It's now a bottom end hotel in a not so good area, with what feels like massive over occupancy.70 online for a twin room which really was a single. The beds were extra thin and even at that it only left a foot in-between them. The 'en-suite' was a plastic portaloo style cubicle constructed beside the door. Functional if you are a midget. Don't expect to sit on the loo with the door closed of have a shower in an un-contorted manner.The dinning room is actually in the basement and about the same size as the bedroom. Breakfast was simple, cereals, toast, 2 hour old boiled eggs and self service everything.The main public use bathroom is on the 1st floor. In my hour of need after checking out, I paid it a hasty visit. Upon completion of the task, to my peril, there was no toilet roll. After a bit of necessary water splashing I then found there was no soap. Nor was there a towel. So hands and backsides dripping, I proceeded down the stairs to let the management know of my predicament.In short, would I go back, probably, but only out of necessity. There is a sort of innocence about the place which makes it easy to forgive it's shortcomings."
8,859,"Mar 6 2009 	Don't Go there!!!	What a joke. This should be named the Steptoe Special. We arrived and immediately saw the wallpaper falling off the wall in the reception area, Then we saw the sign on first and second floor with the missing letters on the plaques. When we got into our room, we saw 1940 furniture. The &quot;En-suite&quot; was in the wardrobe approx 7ft x 3ft. When you opened the door you had to stand up onto a plastic tray which rocked and when you sat on the loo, your head was in the basin. The water was cold as was the shower. The radiator was not switched on and after an evening out in the west end to see a show,we returned soaking wet from the torrential rain and for the second time, we could not enter the hotel from the outside door. The 2 bells did not work and the man behind the reception took half an hour to hear the banging of our knocks on the outside door, as he was asleep. The beds had springs sticking out of the mattresses and the bedding was a sheet, blanket and a throw. Not a duvet. 3 star hotel my eye! 3rd rate yes, 1 star only. We would not even go there again, and never recommend it to anyone. It ought to be checked out by the tourist information board and trading standards. We just wanted to go home or find another hotel of better quality, but could not afford it. Foreigners must haved a total shock and think feel this is our best hotels. Its embarrassing."
9,859,"Jul 11 2008 	Very amusing - not in a good way!!!!	Hmmmmmmmmmm!Ok let me firstly state that my main criteria when booking thi hotel was its seriously close proximity to Hyde Park as i was attending the o2 Festival and didnt want to have to stumble too far.So, on paper it sounded great - Great prestigious Norfolk Sq location, recently refurbished and relatively cheap (75 bb)! Full credits because as described the hotel was in fact in Norfolk Sq however this hotel was far from refurbished - no wonder there are no pictures of the rooms on their website?! The room was tiny, and i mean tiny - so tiny that if this room was in a new build house the planning authority would not even give it status to be marketed as habitable room - by far it would be a small study. The room measure no more than 6ft x 6ft with a pod add on bathroom. Ok, no for the bathroom - imagine and easyjet toilet with a shower in it, im not joking! I have taken pics and will post when i get time! Hygiene was not great either and breakfast was extremely bland. linen was clean though and the tv kind of worked although the hairdryer wast not working!I know 75 doesn't go far in central Ldn but one expects certain standards when booking a 'Double' room - main one being large enough to fit 2 people in. If one of us was standing up the other had to stand or sit on the bed to fit!Crazy but true, don't like leading neg reviews but had no choice here really.Staff were ok, didn't see much of them but the booking procedure and check in/out went smoothy so thats a plus i suppose."
10,859,"Jul 7 2008 	Not Recommended !	Review of room 304:Pro's:- Clean bedding- Good location- Reasonable breakfast (croissants, cereal, juices, tea/coffee, water melon)Con's- Tiny room- 4&quot; wide &quot;Double Mattress&quot; on a single divan base- Minuscule, dirty shower room- Broken hairdryerWe paid 75 for 1 night so my expectations weren't too high, but I do expect a decent bed and a clean bathroom. I'm adamant you could do far better for your money."
11,859,"May 5 2008 	Awful Bathroom 	If like me you did not think that the other reviews here provided a balanced view of the Hyde Park Court Hotel in Norfolk Square Paddington - Beware They Do !The place is an absolute dump. We made the mistake of believing the [---] on their website and booked by phone direct and regretted it. When we discovered how bad it was we spent hours searching the local streets for vacancies without success and had to stay in the place - ARGH. Some of the local hoteliers were even more sorry for us when they realised that we were trying to escape from the Hyde Park Court - it appears that the hotel has a reputation! Whats wrong? Well here's a brief summary of the issues with our room (55 GBP / Night):The double bed was against the wall because no room available for access both sides;No bedside tables at all as no room for them;Bathroom is a plastic unit (like a caravan) built into the room - it is tiny (see picture);You cannot wipe your bum with the door closed, it has to be open;The wash hand basin is IN the shower cubicle;The tap set for the shower is at shoulder level on the side wall of the shower and scalds you if touched;The shower cubicle is approx 75mm wider than the average male's shoulders (you will be scalded at least once);The bed did not have a fitted bottom sheet just a single sheet that did not reach the sides so it could not be tucked in;Only two pillows the depth of ice cream wafers provided - request for extra pillows were met with offers of spare towels (no pillows);Bedding appears to have been purchased from other hotels that were refitted in the 70s / 80s, and quilt cover had evidence of rodent attack;Only 4 hand towels provided (no bath towels) after complaints eventually two bath towels were provided to supplement the pillows;The noise and vibration of every tube train kept you awake;Using the TV to hide the noise was of limited value as eventually you had to get up anyway because the TV had no remote control;The room was very hot despite temps outside below 10C;The ventilation fan provided only worked on slow and because only one power point could only be on when the TV was off;The hotel claims to be adjacent to Hyde Park - they are actually at least 15 minutes walk away with the closest point being Lancaster Gate - take everything said on their website with a pinch of salt.I would only book here if you can gaurantee alternative available accommodation if you are not satisfied AND you are not forced into paying in advance, otherwise DO NOT STAY HERE!"
12,859,"Feb 10 2008	Unbelievable - Still crying now.	Our Room was so small you could hardly move. The bedcovers were dreadful - Why we stayed the night I do not know - but we had little choice - The toilet smelt and as someone has so rightly said was barely bigger than a portaloo.Breakfast consisted of cereal and a roll so dry you couldn't eat it. Everyone was throwing them away.An experience I would never want to repeat. I am not a fussy person and believe that you get what you pay for, but how they get away with these conditions as far as environmental health are concerned I do not know."
13,859,"Oct 24 2007	rats in room	We booked this hotel for a 2 night stey - 3 adults, one 3yr old. The website was interactive and looked very impressive - this was completely deceitful!!! it was a shambles. We left after the first night and these are the reasons.....the entrance was disappointing - very shabby, dirty and disgusting. The reception desk was cracked and the staff were quite unhelpful when there was a problem. One lady in our party was 30 weeks pregnant and we had a 3yr old child with us and we were on the 4th floor - no-one offered help at all. The room was small and dirty, my nephew found the two mouldy maltesers underneath the cupboards. The bathroom was a dirty plastic shell in the corner of the room and offered limited hot water. The television did not work and the room STANK! We were disturbed by the train noise, which runs directly underneath the hotel and rattled windows and furniture alike. The room was cold - due to the inadequate heating and considering the fact that we had a three yr old child with us the metre wide sash window which fell directly onto the street and could not be locked meant we couldn't relax the whole time we were there.The breakfast was inadequate and the staff were arguing between themselves.This was not the only reason we left after our first night - we were woken at 5.40am by rats in our bedroom - that's right...RATS!! Brilliant, especially for a preggers lady and 3yr old!! We moved to the chrysos hotel opposite - couldn't be more helpful - they were wonderful!!if you do decide to stay at the Hyde park then good luck...you'll need it!"
14,859,"Aug 20 2007	definitely pleasant	This hotel is a quite nice place to stay, close to most of conviniences and parks, pleasant area, with lovely people at the reception desk , friendly staff and spacious bedroom... This is not my first trip to London and I expirienced many hotels... I did enjoyed this one, So I will warmly recommend the Hyde park Hotel to anyone looking for a peaceful place with friendly atmosphere."
15,859,"Aug 17 2007	Cheating!!!	The description that based on information provided by the hotel is misleading and dishonest. The rooms that are not appropriate for people - the toilet is less than 40 cm from the bed and there is not enough room for suitcase to be brought into the room. There is something written in arabic in reception - no translation. This place couldn't be called a &quot;hotel&quot; It was very awful experience, we left because it was impossible to stay (credit card was charged) and we had to look for another available hotel at late evening hours. There is strong feeling that this hotel makes its profit by charging &quot;no show charge&quot;?"
16,859,"Aug 8 2007 	Good place to stay	hotel location was superb every thing was on easy access. as i was traveling with children i was woried for safety but foud the hotel and area safe and child friendly. Hotel Staff was very friendly and cooperative as they changed our room from 3rd floor to 1st floor, which was very nice with 2 level and children being on upper level we had a bit of a privacy. Breakfast was the way we like it i.e. simple and light. We enjoyed our our 5 day stay there."
17,859,"Jul 1 2007 	Our Flea infested nightmare in Hell!	We booked into this hotel, the Hyde Park Court hotel, Norfolk Sq, for one night. On checking in they made us pay upfront. Then when we had paid our money they informed us that our room was a 5 minute drive away! We argued with the man behind reception that we didnt want to be moved anywhere. He assurred us that they were booked out and that we'd have to go to these rooms.The place they sent us was a hell hole. The name of the place was the Whiteleaf Hotel, Bayswater. It is a flea infested, disgusting hotel. Rentokil poison in the bedrooms, fleas all over the beds. We have never experienced such a dump. At 5am after arguing with the hotel and calling the police we eventually got moved.So be warned - If you book the Hyde Park Hotel, Norfolk Square you cold potentially be staying in any dump around London. A cardboard box would be cleaner!"
18,859,Jun 18 2007	Do not book here	We booked this hotel on the internet ( not a well known hotel booking site). When we arrived we paid in full and as soon as the money was handed over we were told we were staying in a sister hotel a five minute drive away.. Obviousy we argued until we realised the second hotel was closer to where we were going that evening. The hotel we were taken to looked ok in the beginning. At 3.30 am we woke to realise we were being attacked by bed bugs. There were cockroaches in the bathroom and mouse traps under the bed. It was a horrible experience. We had to leave the hotel at 4am as one of the group had been bitten quite badly.
19,859,"Jun 18 2007 	Avoid this hotel they moved us to an absolute hole	We were a party of 7 girls and had booked 2 rooms in the Hyde Park Court Hotel on the Internet. When we arrived at the Hyde Park Court Hotel after we paid our money they told us we would be driven to our rooms?? We were then brought to another hotel called the Whiteleaf hotel in Bayswater which is the most disgusting hotel in London - we woke up in the middle of the night with cockroaches and bugs in our beds. We moved hotels at 5am in the morning. We are upset because we didnt book into the Whiteleaf hotel we had booked into the Hyde Park Court Hotel. Please avoid booking here because we wouldn't like anyone else to experience what we did. Lisa Martin Dublin, Ireland"
20,859,"Jun 7 2007	wouldn't call it a ""hotel"" never again!	The location of this b&amp;b was ok as it was near bus stops,shops etc. The bathroom was like a portaloo - and smelled like one aswell! There was no lifts in this building and our room was on the 4th floor so you can imagine trying to drag a suitcase up 80 steps - yes we counted them, and trying to get your luggage down them again was quite dangerous. So if you have children with you or bad joints or getting on in years this place would not be suitable unless you were guaranteed a room on ground level. If we were going out sight seeing we tried to aviod going back to the hotel to avoid hard slogs up the stairs so we stayed out for as long as possible! The breakfast room was tiny - only 5 tables so if they were all being used you had to wait. Also the staff didn't speak good english. The food at breakfast was ok, not a lot of choice just cereal and a bun but i suppose for the money you pay it was ok. This place would be ok if you were just staying for one night but i would not recommend it for a full weekend stay. Truly awful place."
21,859,Dec 11 2006	awful..do not stay here at any cost!!!!!!!	A shocking waste of money and would not recommend it to anyone. double ensuite room was so small we couldn't even move around the bed and the ensuite was literally no bigger than a toilet you would find in a plane! there was no hot water and when i asked at the reception they told me to &quot;use the kettle&quot; As both me and my wife work in the hotel and catering trade we have stayed in some fantastic hotels but i would never concider staying at this hotel again. Read the reviews!!
22,859,"May 5 2006 	Stay Away	I stayed in this hotel in april and i am really kicking my self why i booked the hotel is so badly run that the moment i enter it i was thinking where i came, the gave me the room in the basement and you can hear when people are walking the room is smelly and the bathroom looks like just taken from the construction site, you have to pay on arrival with out seeing the room, and know i can understand why is that, the recpionist is so rude and don't know about anything, when asked, the manager isn't help ful either saying that cannot move me if i want to move i have to pay extra, the breakfast was horriable and unhygenic, thankfuly i checked out and find some decent place to stay. my advise to everyone stay away from this hotel."
23,859,May 3 2006	Would not recommend	We styaed in this hotel last September for two nights and was veru disappointed with standard of accommodation we recieved. We found the room not very clean and the bathroom as well. The bathroom was also very small and it would take about half an hour for the hot water to heat up. I'm serious! Breakfast was included in the rate but you're better off skipping what they serve you altogether. Stale cereal and bread with tea/coffee. Staff were nice enough though but I'm sure you could definitely find better accommodation in London for the same price.
24,859,"Jan 3 2006	Hmmm.... I guess its a Hotel....	What can I say, we should have checked this website before we booked. All the reviews we have read have been on the mark. The place is small, dirty, feels unsafe to stay at, smells like a frat house (some smoking surely going on there) the &quot;En-Suite&quot; looks like it has been taken from a demountable on a construction site. The area is nice and its convenient for the tube (which as another reviewer put it seems to run directly under the hotel).We booked online through wotif and have never missed with them before, I guess the Self Rated (by the hotel) 3 stars should have been a warning the spelling mistakes in the description... where exactly is piccidlly curcuse?Anyway, if you can avoid it then do so... I would not wish it on anyone... not even my worst enemy!"
25,859,"Nov 6 2005	Never again!	This is by far the worst accomodation I have ever stayed at. The room was filthy, with rips and stains, including blood, on the bedspreads. The bathroom smelled like an open sewer and even with the one window propped open over night and the fan going, we could not use the bathroom except for emergencies. The smell was even coming from the shower drain! The photos on line looked nothing like the reality. The price included breakfast, however we were afraid to eat here considering the lack of cleanliness in the room. Stay away! It is better to pay a bit more and feel comfortable and clean. I would not even recommend this property to a low budget traveler."
26,859,"Aug 3 2005	Only recommended when tight budget	Booked according to the webpage, which shows the rooms very different and not like they are in reality. Bed was quite old, same as all interiors include of the bathroom. Room and bathroom where very small and only 1 towel per person. Only small staircases, no lift, and no smoke detectors inside rooms. No hangers in whatsoever way. There was a waterboiler with coffee and teabags, but when opened the waterboiler there was old water inside together with lime inside swimming. Don't know how long it was inside. Rooms have to be paid in advance. If front rooms, nice view to small park. Quiet street, though only 2 min walk to shops/restaurants and 3 min walk to Paddington station. Breakfast was very simple. Staff was friendly, but not &quot;overfriendly&quot;. Can only recommend, if budget is very tight. Overall athmosphere was not nice."
27,859,"Jun 7 2005	Horrible hotel Never Go !!!!	This hotel is one of, if not, the worst I have ever experienced, you should never go there!Hotel dirty, small rooms without window, underground noise, mattress very old, dirty and very uncomfortable (we felt all the springs!), full payment required at check-in before showing rooms!!!! The website does not show the realty. The breakfast is poor. The prices are overestimated since we obtained a reduction of 35 % in 5 minutes!When we get back from dinner, we found the door of our room opened !! Fortunately, nothing was stolen..."
28,859,"Apr 8 2005	Horrible	I absolutely love London but would honestly rather not visit London again than stay in a Hotel like this. They have, infact, got a nerve passing this off as a hotel. When we checked in we were asked to pay up front and then shown to our rooms in the 'basement'. I then realised why they took payment up front, as this hotel is shocking. One of the 'basement' rooms we occupied had a window that did not close properly and the other had bars up at the window (a complete fire hazard!!!). There was rubbish and a dirty old mattress piled up outside of the room windows which looked so discusting that there was no choice but to keep the curtains closed. The rooms themselves were dirty and small, the furniture was old and wallpaper was peeling off the walls. To add to all of this you were disturbed until late at night, and again first thing in the mornings by the tubes which obvioulsy passed directly under the 'hotel' and shook it. We were also disturbed, in the middle of each night, by staff running about the basement laughing and joking. I actually had my suitcase against the room door at night as I certainly did not feel safe and secure in this hotel.Breakfast was pathetic and served in the hotel reception area. It was complete false advertising as there was certainly no coffee shop and their Resteraunt was actually accross the street somewhere (didn't see it so I would have to take their word for it). The hotel was so bad that we spent the entire first day of our vacation walking around London looking for alternative accommodation!!!This was a really nasty experience and I am posting this review as I would not wish it on anyone else. I would urge anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in London to avoid this one as, although it is reasonably priced, it really is of an appalling standard."
29,859,"Mar 5 2005	You get what you pay for	I totally agree with &quot;Cassie&quot;. My single room was closet size, the bed was very uncomfortable, and the underground beneath reverberated through the whole building, even though I was on the 3rd floor. My daughter and her boyfriend had a room in the basement, where the noise was worse. Fortunately I found the linen closet and helped myself to additional/clean towels.Staff was OK, the location is perfect, and it is vey inexpensive, but I'll never stay there again and cannor recommend it."
30,859,"Oct 23 2004	Just BAD	What a pit!! We were in Room BO1, the basement.&quot;En-suite&quot;? Toilet and tiny sink were in a SMALL closet under the stairs. There was no door knob on the inside of the &quot;en-suite&quot; because if you bent over to use the sink, your backside pushed the door open and would have been bruised. There was no towel bar/ring, no TP holder, no toilet brush, no shelf. no vent. The shower stall was out in the room, with only a bit of stick-on frosted plastic (contact paper) for privacy. We were given one towel each but there was no place to hang the towel--wet or dry. They could not replace a burnt out lightbulb for the reading light--had none. Multiple cobwebs all around the ceiling: the room finish and paint were peeling off over the &quot;phone box&quot; closet-- which was placed in front of a door that went to the inside building well-- no fire escape, no security on a window that was below street level, and water was dripping continuously somewhere out there. No smoke detector; the mattresses were soiled and had a hard lump in the middle; no radio; &quot;satellite TV&quot;?--only 5 channels on the TV. There does not exist a &quot;Bar/Coffee shop&quot;, nor is there a &quot;Lounge&quot;. What restaurant? The breakfast area has a flat screen TV, but does not have any chairs other than the wooden ones for the breakfast tables, and there is not enough seating for breakfast--wait in line. Breakfast consists of dry box cereal, day-old croissants and buns, juice from a box, a hot water pot with your choice of instant coffee or tea bags. The tables are so low that you cannot get your legs under the table without upsetting everything on it. I never saw an ice machine, but maybe it was upstairs somewhere.The list goes on, but enough. False advertising might be the case. Find somewhere else, we looked in Cardiff Hotel, much better."
31,859,Jul 8 2004	false advertising.	Arrived tired to find desk staff unhelpful.. had booked on internet. sent us to basement room with smelly rubbish piled up outside window and bathroom had broken tiles on shower floor. After much talking they finally found a 2nd floor room that was a bit better. Breakfast was ordinary not even able to put cloth on table! Might be cheap but doesnt have to be nasty.
32,859,"Jun 23 2004	Disappointing Stay	The name &quot;Hyde Park Court Hotel&quot; conjures up images of sprawling parks and appealing decor. I would not, however, recommend this hotel to anyone. While it's true that the hotel is within walking distance to Hyde Park and the location in Paddington is most convenient, my 5 days spent there were most unpleasant. The room was so small that there was literally no place to put down the suitcases, and the bathroom was in fact smaller than an airplane bathroom. I had to stand in the shower to get dressed. As for the room service, the maid simply folded the wet towel and placed it on the bed everyday; needless to say, the shower curtain and entire room smelled of mildew. Breakfast was nothing special. The staff was courteous but not friendly. Surely there are better values in London."
33,859,"Jun 16 2004	Disappointing .	It's a cheap hotel but that's it. Small rooms , not very clean and the breakfast wasn't really extensive. The staff was friendly but the rest was a disappointment if you go by their website ."
34,859,Jun 11 2004	never again	Mixed up the reservation. Tried to put us in a double when I had booked a twin. Beds very uncomfortable. Horrible smell in the bathroom. Stale bread at breakfast. 79 stairs to the room.
35,859,"May 19 2004	Clean Room Poor Service	I decided on the Hyde Park Court because I wanted an inexpensive single room near Paddington Station. Indeed, I booked a room via laterooms.com for 36, a very good price for London. When I arrived at 10:00 pm, the desk clerk claimed I had reserved 2 rooms. He insisted on showing me the screen of his PC, displaying all the rooms in the hotel with my name next to 2 of them. He implied strongly that this must be my fault. I offered to show him the written confirmation from laterooms.com confirming *one* room. After 5 minutes of indecision, he decided to check me in and only ask me to pay for one room. After going out to dinner, I returned and asked the same clerk to see the London telephone directory. His response was, &quot;Do you really need to see it?&quot; I replied that, yes, I did want to look up a telephone number and address. The clerk looked on the bookshelf above his desk and then replied, &quot;I'm sorry, we used to have one, but we don't anymore.&quot;At this point, I gave up on the service. The room itself was very small, but fair for the price. It was very clean as well. It smelled strongly of smoke, but I don't expect otherwise in small hotels in Europe. However, the bed was the 2nd most uncomfortable I've ever had. In fact, it felt like they had made the bed on a box spring rather than on a mattress. I felt many dozens of coil springs right under the sheet. I ended up laying on my side at the very side of the box spring, and not sleeping very well. No, I didn't complain, because by that point I didn't really want to interact with the desk clerk any more. I know I didn't pay much, but I still expect better than this!"
36,859,"Mar 3 2004	Student says it is better than a hostel!	I stayed at this hotel for 11 nights in September 2004. While it is not a Hilton, it does do the job. The staff were soooo kind, I really can not stress that enough. They were helpful and always had a smile on their face. The room was cleaned everyday. The cleaning staff did a good job and worked around all our excess luggage. We never worried about leaving anything in the room. The bathroom was interesting but aren't they all usually. The room was spacious by European standards. The breakfast was minimal but most are. It was good though, filling. I would definitely stay here again if I was on a budget in London."
37,859,Dec 25 2003	Abvisable hotel	23.12.2004The hotel is clear and quiet. The rooms are small but clear and the breakfast is simple.It is in a good position near the underground station and the bus stations.I think it is economic and advisable.
38,859,Aug 28 2009 	Topaia!!!!
39,859,Feb 15 2009	nicht weiterzuempfehlen
1,862,Jul 16 2008 	Depends what you're looking for	Some friends visited from the states but had a difficult time finding a room. This place had an opening so we booked it. For a cheap hotel in London it wasn't bad... but compared to what they were used to it did not fit their standards. The carpet was very worn as was the furniture in the room. Their room was in the basement and was very musty and dusty. It was also TINY! But the sheets and bathroom were clean and the loo worked just fine.
2,862,"Aug 27 2007 	Good location not the nicest place	I really wasn't expecting a lot before we got to our hotel, and I didn't get it. The rooms were tiny and cramped and definitely old, but it really wasn't that bad. All we did was sleep here and that was fine. It was clean and that was what I was most concerned with. We had hot water and the noise level wasn't bad at all. The Ritz, it isn't, but if you're looking for a hotel that is reasonably priced and in a good location I would recommend staying here."
3,862,May 4 2007	Don't Stay Here!	My friend and I stayed for a week while in London to see Guys and Dolls. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in! The sheets were not clean or changed even though we asked at least 7 times. When the people did come in to &quot; clean&quot; we were still in the room getting ready for the day! They didn't even knock before they came in!The fire alarm went off every night with no explanation. The noise level was horrible. I expected better out of Notting Hill ( though it is close to Bayswater). It's not even worth for people who only want a place to sleep and don't care about it's conditions. It is way overpriced for such a bad experience. I love London and go there often. But I will never stay at the Hyde Park West again.
4,862,"Jan 1 2007 	this place is horrible!!!!!!!!	after traveling for nine hours i got to this hotel, which was booked weeks in advance. when i finally found it after walking the streets for about 45 minutes they told me i have been moved to another hotel. the hotel i was moved to was even worse. no one spoke english and the room was just bad! i believe they overbooked the hotel and i was very upset. not a good start to a vacation!"
5,862,"Jan 1 2007 	Worst hotel in London and we were only there 5 minutes	So we finally find the hotel after being given the worst directions, and it looked like a nice area. After staying in London and Amsterdam for almost 2 weeks we were not expecting a whole lot. The steps were destroyed on the way in, and the guy behind the counter was highly unhelpful. Our room had been booked for a month and he told us he had to check us into another hotel. In a way I was happy as the carpet was filthy and the floor creaked badly. The couches in the lobby had tape around them like I was in a fraternity house. it was funny in a way. They got us a cab to our new hotel and he gave me some [----] attitude. Too tired to really care but wanted to give him a slap. My advice....don't ever go to this hotel the whole place smells like vomit and it's really disgusting. Seriously it sucks"
6,862,"Dec 8 2006 	Piece of rundown Russia in Notting Hill	Were meant to stay at the Majestic (do no recommend) but taken to this one in a dodgy, smoky cab because the Majestic had heating problems in its rooms.Well.. it was cold in this hotel in a basement room where the locks didn't seem to work, everything was dirty, door handles were falling off, paint had come off most walls and there was damp in the ceiling and liquid between the paint and the wall in a kind of bubble we thought would burst and result us getting soaked in our sleep. There was no sound insulation whatsoever so we were kept awake most of the night by people coming and going. Also, the toilet was tiny and didn't appear very clean. Flushing the loo was as loud as in an airplane so you could hear all your neighbours.This is by no means a two-star hotel. We skipped breakfast as food poisoning seemed likely. This is more like a dated motel, something I would've thought to find if I'd go on a roadtrip through the dark parts of Russia or on a bad roadtrip in Mexico. Don't let the exterior fool you and at least do not accept a basement room."
7,862,"Nov 6 2006	Don't mind coming back	Old, yes. Worn, yes. But you could sleep in the beds, the room was clean, the sheets were clean, and there were clean towels every day. But it was inexpensive, and in London there are lots of other things on which to spend your money."
8,862,"Oct 22 2006 	Not a nice place to stay!	I arrived at this hotel with low expectations. The location of the hotel is superb but the room I stayed in (no. 19) was shabby, dusty, dirty (walls covered with dead insects), a moulding carpet, a bed spring with holes, a mattress that resembled a board, and a shower that was the size of a matchbox. Management was not hospitable and on departure I had a dispute about a breakfast bill which was included in the room price. Avoid the breakfast unless you want old bread and croissants. Very disappointing but then again you don't come to London to spend a lot of time in your hotel room."
9,862,"Oct 16 2006 	should be cheaper!	Hyde Park West Hotel is a dump but with just cause as the cost of a room 40 for one night is very cheap for its location within London. I do not recommend this hotel to families as you will not find it accomdating to any of your needs. I booked this hotel at the last minute and regret doing so as there are much better hotels which follow the underground lines further out from the centre of London, for around the same cost. The very few hours we spent in the hotel was very uncomfortable due to the beds being infested with fleas. I would recommmend if you were staying in this hotel to get very drunk in and around the very nice Notting Hill pubs and upon returning to your room you will be under the impression it is Buckingham Palace!"
10,862,"Oct 5 2006 	Not bad :)	OK The first thing you'll notice is its not the Ritz .. but at the price you're paying in london in a great location its not that bad.Its not the cleanest place in the world (bit of mould in places ... carpets a bit worn in places ... wallpaper peeling a bit) but over all it suited its purpose it was a bed at night and we had our own toilet / shower and could leave our stuff during the day, also a small portable tv in the room, not great sellings points for a lot of people but for us it was grand. The double bed was against a wall so slightly inconvient the bed covers weren't the greatest either and the room was small enough. We were staying on the First floor I wouldn't really recommend it to a family with young children but if you're willing to rough it a little bit at a cheap enough price go for it. The continental breakfast was basic fare but eat as much as you want (saves you a good bit given that london isn't the cheapest of places). There was a kettle / instant coffee / tea in the room. The staff were generally friendly :). As to the Noise level well its not the quietest of places but it also wasn't that loud ... its in a relatively quiet upmarket area so traffic noise is at a minimum at night. I would say if you had noisey neighbours in the rooms next door to you you'd probably be able to hear a bit too much from them.To put my review in perspective ... I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels before and this isn't one of them ... it'd be a low end two star I would guess but overall I was quite happy with my stay and I'd give the place maybe a 6 / 10 for what it is :) Budget Accommodation close to the heart of london (lets face it london is quite expensive). You're about 3 minutes from a tube station by foot.Hopefully this review is a help to others as I've seen some recent reviews here slating the place and had actually become a bit worried before heading over to london and staying there."
11,862,Oct 4 2006 	DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT	what an absolute disaster. My husband and I booked a single night before a tour then 4 nights after the tour. The manager was rude- unhelpful and couldnt care less. Our room was the size of a match box and not as clean. The window wouldnt close. Thewater from the shower wouldnt drain away. We reported this and reception said. I dont care- flood the room. Breakfast was a joke. After really causing a stir they finally moved up to the sister Hotel-Dont even consider this place. Its the biggest dump in London.They lock you out at 10.00pm. Sleep in the street if the Hyde Park west is all thats available
12,862,"Sep 21 2006 	Gives new meaning to ""substandard""	I booked a five day stay through TravelStay.com. I paid 40.22 pounds directly to them and had to pay the entire 213.28 poundsupon arrival. I arrived around 12:30p.m. after flying in from San Diego and was told to come back at 2:00p.m. to check in. My room was just around the corner from the reception desk and it was noisey, doors slamming, loud talking, etc. Fortunately I'm used to wearing ear plugs so I was able to sleep. Oh, the bed, I thought they'd made a mistake and left box springs instead of a mattress and it listed to the starboard side which put you in prime viewing position of the TV which was now a foot from my nose. Microscopic describes the room, miniature bathroom and the shower was laughable. Luckily I didn't find any bugs in the bed and the room was given a quick onceover each day, the bathroom towel was replaced and occasionally a new bar of soap from a dollhouse was left. The general state of the hotel reminds me of the movie &quot;Whatever happened to Baby Jane&quot;.Hotel motto: You couldn't do worse!"
13,862,"Jul 11 2006	No no no! Don't go!	Hotels in London are expensive. So you think you can save a couple of Pounds...?! Think again.Stay alive instead, snljp!Do not stay here!"
14,862,"Jul 9 2006	What a dump!!!	This dump should be condemned. Everything is filthy and falling apart. The front steps are crumbling and the carpet and furniture are held together with duct tape. The sagging, rotten beds are full of holes. Our window was broken and held together with masking tape. The TV didn't work and we were promised a replacement which never came. The bathroom reeked of urine. I was led to believe that breakfast was included, but after having a glass of juice, cup of crappy coffee and a dried-up croissant I was given a bill for eight pounds! The staff was rude, belligerent, discourteous and barely spoke English. The building hasn't seen a paintbrush in years. This once grand structure deserves far better than the money -- that currently own and operate what is laughingly called a hotel."
15,862,"Jul 5 2006	Sleaze Park West	Me and my wife spent two (!) nights in this miserable rathole. Its really falling apart, pitholes on the floor are covered with worn-out rugs, our &quot;room&quot; was in the cellar, next to breakfast room - and it smells like a week-old meat in the sunshine with millions of flies on it. Room corners were covered with spidernets, window could not opened, shower was clocced (until I opened it). We though that we are in Candid Camera when the flegmatic clerck told us to go downstairs to a really maze and find our cell. Take our warning seriously: Dont go in to this place, a night on a park bench is better alternative. Finally, when we were checking out, the man behind desk got nerves to beg us pay our breakfasts, they do not include via internet booked room rate. 16 Sterling Pounds for four portions of rubber-like croissants (no toast) and poor coffee is a robbery! Markku and Leena"
16,862,"Jun 24 2006	Could this place be more foul?	My boyfriend and I wanted budget accommodation in London for one night, and as a hostel was going to be about the same price as a hotel we decided to go for the hotel option. WHile we knew we wouldn't be staying in the ritz this was just the PITS!!! The place is falling down, it stinks like mould and who knows what else.It is just revolting! So in summary my best advice is Don't go there!!!!"
17,862,"Jun 19 2006 	Worst. Hotel. Evar.	My wife and I are easy going. We don't complain about a lot of issues we encounter, we aren' the types that send food back when it's not perfect. But if we could, we'd send this hotel back to the pits of hell. I booked this hotel via Orbitz at the last second. I should have Googled around and found the other poor souls that gave money to this rent-a-slum. We checked in really late at night and the guy at the front desk was actually a very nice man. He must have been new and still had a soul. He mentioned something about us &quot;being disappointed in the end&quot; and I didn't get it. When a hotel front desk clerk basically tells you &quot;Welcome, it's all down hill from here&quot; that is a good indicator that something might be amiss. Ah, hindsight... The rooms, have no AC. After trying our best to walk quietly down the tiny hall with a full load of bags, we entered our cell. Out in the hall there was a tray of roomservice food that someone left over that was there for over 24 hours. The room was swealtering. After having the window open for 5 minutes, our room was full of bugs. So we had to close the window. We tried to sleep on what appeared to be a WWII-era bed. My pillow had what appeared to be dried blood on it. The bed had other people's hair all over it. At 2am our room was at 80 degrees so we had to open the window. However instead of the bugs, there were cats outside mating. Or maybe they were trying to tell us to leave. I don't know. We finally slept that night and promply woke up the next morning, went to an Internet cafe and booked another hotel. The &quot;free&quot; hotel Internet is really a 3rd-party Internet provider that the hotel pays. Well they didn't pay their bill and the Internet didn't work. We packed up all of our stuff and just left without checking out. We made it to the new hotel and called Orbitz to see if we could get a refund of our &quot;prepaid&quot; travel plans. At first Orbitz didn't see to cool with this. She called the Hyde Park hotel to cancel the remainded of the trip and had me on hold for about 5 minutes. She said that the hotel staff that she talked to were VERY rude and not helpful. She said that Orbitz would happily refund me the unused nights (4 less the 1 night in hell). She said that she can see why we left. So yay Orbitz. Boo Hyde Park."
18,862,"Apr 3 2006	What a crap hole!	I've been reading the reviews and laughing a lot. Everyone is true. However, we didn't freeze in the basement, we roasted in the attic. The shower drain was clogged and water stood up to your ankles when the shower was finished. The bathroom door hung from it's hinges so you had to pick it up to open or close it. The beds sucked! Because we didn't need our blankets (too hot up there), I folded mine and put it under my sheet for extra padding. I beg anyone who reads this... don't stay here! Thankfully we were only there at night, but those 8 hours were too many. (And by the way, I've stayed at many youth hostels and this place was worse than all of them)"
19,862,"Mar 21 2006	It rates just a step above a hovel	It rates just a step abeve a hovel: single rooms in a closet below the roof, three square metres, a 20cmx20cm basin. The only decrepit and scraped building in a nice area, with peeling paint and thorn out carpets. Very cheap, but it worth paying a some more to have a better hotel. Not so bad the kitchen with the Italian cook."
20,862,"Feb 20 2006	1.5 stars? Why the extra half star?	This hotel was outrageous. Absolutely the shabbiest, most tattered and worn edifice this side of the Thames. I recommend this hotel to no one. I will post my reasons in a list for quick viewing:1) Don't ask for a &quot;double bed&quot; - according to the HPW, that means 2 twins beds that you can shove together.2) the rug is so dusty my footfalls raise plumes.3) the shower is so small that I can barely fit through the doors, and I weigh 155 pounds.4) the walls are so thin that we just watched whatever the people next door were watching - kind of like surround sound, only less so.5) The &quot;teapot&quot; was full of calcium buildup, which means your tea will smell and taste like rotted eggs.Look, I could go on and on. The best part about this hotel is the fact that there is a private all boys boarding school across the square, which, if young white british boys in gray coats and red ties is your thing, you're in luck. If non-working phones, a definitive &quot;funk&quot; that pervades every crevice of the hotel, and about $100 US per night sound like your bag, c'est la vie. Hey, it could be worse - we could've gotten the bedbugs on the bottom floor..."
21,862,Jan 1 2006	Way over priced for a small little dump	I am a female traveling Europe alone and I was there for 3 miserable nights. I'm so disappointed that I didn't check the hotel on trip advisor. The young girl and the gentleman that worked the desk were nice but the rooms were not well kept. I was even scared to sleep in the sheets. My shower was broken and they have signs up in the rooms to not leave valuables in the rooms....which makes sense but I just didn't feel safe. I had a friend who wanted to stay over night since he worked close to the hotel and didn't want to go home. The Hotel does not allow guests in the rooms so he had to purchase his own small little room for the 4 hours he was there.....crazy.
22,862,"Dec 13 2005	Horrible Hotel	This was the worst hotel I ever stayed! And I traveled a lot in my life.First: it does not meet the basic hygiene standards. We got small insects in our bed, that traveled along back to my home (Belgium) and have disturbed my nightsleep for more then two months. See attached pictures for an example of these insects that only come out at night looking for blood. They are very difficult to exterminate and can disturb you for months/years.Second: the rooms are very old and not clean.Third: the staff is not at all interested in your comfort. On the contrary, they try to take advantage from tourists. They booked an illegal taxi in London for our trip to Madame Tussauds and of course .. this person tried to ask a lot of money."
23,862,Sep 22 2005	Don't stay here	Small room. Could feel the springs in the mattress. Pillows were thin as playing cards. Overall it was more like a youth hostel than a hotel. This hotel was selected only based on cost and I still feel like I overpaid.
24,862,"Aug 10 2005	Horrible hotel	My husband and I went to this hotel in June 2005. We booked the hotel on internet. When we first arrived, the appearance of the building gave us a very good impression. It's a tradition english style building and near Notting Hill. But, after we got inside, horrible experience began.The staff told us the room was leakage and the hotel was full. We had to go to the other hotel near Victoria Station. He told us the hotel was same. So, we moved to the other hotel and it was obviously totally different. The door lock of the room was broken before, potatoes chip were on the floor and towel was changed from white colour to grey colour. We requested to back to the Hype Park West again. But the staff told us we had to wait half an hour for another cab and it was 7:30 at night. In order to solve the problem as quickly as possible, we paid the cab by ourselves for getting back.We told the staff in Hyde Park West this was not acceptable. We booked this hotel was because of the location and the staff just kept saying that it was the same. It was different name of the hotel, different location and different finishes. Nothing is the same. Finally, we asked him to give our money back. He said he was not the person in charge and it was not his business. He asked us to come back next morning to talk to his manager. However, during that night, he was the only staff in the hotel. He also showed us a list that a number of his clients were moved to that hotel. We then asked him whether it was all because of the water leakage. He said &quot;NO&quot;.At last, we left that hotel and found another one by ourselves. We complained it to the website we booked the hotel. Luckily, the staff of the website was a &quot;responsible person&quot; and promised not to deduct any charges.WE WON&quot;T STAY THIS HOTEL AGAIN."
25,862,"Jul 18 2005	What a Dump	Many issues..hotel facade is crumbling before your eyes. courtyard could be so pleasant with some effort. The steps up to the hotel door are dangerous as the steps are crumbling..ready for an old person or an American to fall and sue..They need to do something. Lift was broken...No ice at all though this would cost so little to have installed. The staff were very rude and difficult when we tried to check in at 1230 looking for a double room. They told us to wait until 2PM after we had travelled so far..Finally we were offered our room on the second floor...did not want a basement room with bars on the windows..and it had twin beds after we requested a double. The wallpaper from WWII had water stains all over it. What a little paint could do. The carpet had not been cleaned since it was installed in the 70s. There was old gum in the carpet and the so-called satellite TV meant 6 channels instead of 4 and that was a chore as there was no remote and figuring out the TV controls required a degree in elec. engineering. Next night we got our double room on the end of the second floor and the bed was a little softer after a bad back from the night before. The sheets were at least clean, but that was all. Tiny bathroom, no air conditioning, noisy slamming doors I would only go here alone or with a friend...I would not take a female partner as it was embarrassingly bad. 2 stars? I don't think so...Noel, Dallas, Texas"
26,862,"Jul 12 2005	Hotel for busy people	My wife and I just recently got back from a trip to the UK. We stayed at the Hyde Park West on two seperate nights. The rooms are small so if you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in them the hotel works out fine. Unless they put you in what I called the dungeon which is the basement, the room we got down there was not as nice as the one on the first floor. The tube is only about a 5 to 1o minute walk away which makes it pretty convienent. The staff was very plesant except for one guy who I don't think wanted to be there. In are case my ended up finding out she was prgnant before we left so the fact that she was tired made this hotel not work out the best for us cause you are limited as far as facilities and tv channels. If you are going to spend most of your time sightseeing this hotel will save you money and you can live with its shortcomings."
27,862,"Jun 7 2005	Save your money sleep in the park-more comfortable	Bars on windows, bathroom the size of a coffin, showers that either freeze or scald, beds that look like they were picked up at the side of the road. Try to get an extra pillow or blanket, I dare you. Horrible evil, hotel staff. Telephone that won't even let you dial the freephone number to call your travel agent to get you out of there. Shoe box sized room.Hell without the heat."
28,862,"May 23 2005	Read Reviews Before You Book!	This hotel was absolutely horrible. It was extremely small, hot, had two twin beds instead of a double or queen. We did have regular cleaning service with towels daily. The shower was very small, but the hot water was in abundance. The lift was out of order, so we had to lug our heavy luggage up several flights of stairs. On our departure day, we saw the staff use the lift for cleaning supplies. I was not impressed at all with that crap hole. You get what you pay forand we paid a hell of a lot more than that was worth. I wish I had read the reviews of this hotel before I reserved a room. The only thing it had going for it was the short walk to the underground station."
29,862,"May 22 2005	The Greatest place on earth.	The Hyde Park West is a nice place to stay. Upon arrival, we went into a conference room and found there were bugs in the chandeliers. We had 4 people in a room with a full size and twin bed. the window got stuck open and it was reallly nice. The shower head fell off of the wall.. and there was bad water pressure. The walls were very thin and we heard people engaging in intercourse often. When we told the guy at the desk, he laughed and said he heard it all the time. We also found a rotten watermelon on the stairs. After seeing it there for 3 days.. we decided we were going to kick it... so we did and the mess was left there for another 3 days. All in All.. we had a lot of fun. I enjoyed London and it was in a nice location to where we could walk around til 4 in the morning and hang out... if cleanliness is not an issue and money is, Hyde Park is the place to be."
30,862,"Apr 26 2005	Wish I'd read these reviews before I booked the hotel!	This hotel is probably the worst place I've stayed. I was travelling with mydaughter who says most youth hostels are better than the Hyde Park West.The place is dirty, the front desk staff are rude and when we were there for 4 days the place was full of student tour groups that were mostly undisciplined. We ended up spending one night at another hotel owned/managed by the same group when our reaservation was &quot;bumped&quot; in favorof a school group and the Majestic was equally as bad. Do yourself a favor and stay away from these two places. A great location does not make upfor the other problems."
31,862,"Feb 11 2005	Awfull	My nightmare came true!!!! I've booked the hotel and found this site &quot;to late&quot; all those bad comments, but i thought maybe all this people are used to sleep in a hilton or something. When you book a &quot;budget&quot; hotel you don't expect to much (and I really had a lot of bad hotels in my life all over the world) but for 130 euro for 2 nights I just want a little more than what we've got. First night we slept in the basement my friend and one and of the room and I 5 meters on the other end of the room!?!?!?!, and it was freezing there and it was not that cold outside, so whe asked for an extra blanket, that was'nt possible because the whe're full, the pillow was 1 cm thick whe call that a pancake you don't sleep on that. That first night we did'nt sleep that much because everybody came home from there night out, we slept under the stairs so we heard every footstep on it, the next morning whe woke after 2 hours sleep from the ladies who worked at the hotel, they had a lot to discus at 7 in the mornig,we had breakfast what was'nt included for us????? strange but, whatever we were not supose to pay it. Then the shower it had really the size of a coffin and dangerous the hot water was at the wrong side??Then the second night we had an other room, that was even whorse than the first, no towels and a bed that had at least 1.000.000 sleep hours, the iron of the bed stood in my back the other moning.  So if somebody wants to sleep there just think 2 and spend a few euros extra. I also wat to say that some off the personel really need a kick in the --- really hard, esp. the lady at the desk in the morning. I don't think that I've said everything but all the reviews are reality and you will expierience them when you sleep there. I have enough off Hyde Park West."
32,862,"Feb 2 2005	Crap	Actually I wouldn't even give this hotel a &quot;one&quot; because it was so disgusting. The staff were horrible, the windows were falling out, the bed sheets were dirty the bathroom was minty, the walls were thin and all we could hear were people doing it all night. My girlfriend and I were transfered here from The Magestic hotel, (not so magestic either) so I don't recommend you stay there if you are on a budget. Maybe you should travel a bit further down the road to Paddington and stay at Westpoint Hotel 170-172 Sussex Gardens."
33,862,"Jan 2 2005	Nice but cold	Nice hotel.,but not in the wintertime. They say that England is the country with plain windows and double curtains. It dont match with this hotel. I've never frosen like this before (and i am from Sweden). We asked for extra blankets, but the only thing that happend was that they doubbled the ordenary blanket. (sic!) The cleaning of the room was almost O.K. but they forgot the bathroom, and finding old chips on the floor is not o.k. The staff was o.k. but the brekfeast (4) was not priceworth. Go up to the mainstreet and buy a warm chiabatta and juice for the same price.Use this hotel in the summertime but not in wintertime. There is no bar in this hotel or restaurant. (they maybe hide it very well. we didn't find it any way)The nearest PUB do not have real ale so go to the next. (this is not for the hotel, just information)"

This hotel was used by Newmarket coach holidays for a one night stay whilst we went to see Ben Hur, the food was gd at the hotel, but they were so disorganised, it was untrue, and no one spoke any English, you had to repeat orders constantly, its was so frustrating when we arrived back at the hotel, after a lovely evening, (Ben Hur) was fanastic, we had to wait about 25 mins to get a drink, they had'nt thought it out, that the coach would come back with hungry, thirsty clients, and there was only two staff on the bar, and they couldnt understand what we were saying, breakfast was also the same, with everyone unable to find cups, spoons etc, the food was fine... in fact I give them 8/10 for their food, which was lovely....we really need a few staff that can speak English, and more of them....

3,864,Sep 20 2009 	Poor service	Had booked in to Ibis Excel (booking made in February 2009).Arrived for stay on 18th September 2009 only to find our room had been double booked!!!! TAKES 7 MONTHS TO FIND THAT OUT AND ON DAY OF ARRIVAL.Staff not able to give satisfactory reason.We were transferred to Ibis Docklands and assured we would be charged same rate for B/B.Paid for two nights on our arrival (receipted).After a long day sightseeing on the second day we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant only to find that there was &quot;A problem in the kitchen&quot; but we could have a snack! So no meal unless we went out!On morning of departure receptionist tried to get extra money out of us stating we had been undercharged for our room and breakfast.We HAD paid exactly what we should have done for the cancelled hotel and had written evidence to prove it.Took several minutes and much glaring at computer screens before receptionist &quot;realised&quot; I was right.You can imagine our experience of Ibis hotels in London was not good!
4,864,"Sep 11 2009 	Awful!!	For the money you pay there are many far better hotels.The matress was about 1cm thick, the bathroom was like a portaloo attached to the room. I've stayed in cheaper places and had much better room &amp; service.If i could rate this hotel as a minus i would!!"
5,864,"Aug 21 2009 	Very disappointed	Extremely diappointed with the online service of this hotel, would strongly advise anyone do not book online with this company!!! Manager and staff really unhelpful and do not care once they have recieved payment, be very careful!!!!!"
6,864,"Aug 20 2009	Very basic hotel that needed more staff.	My brother and i stayed in this hotel for one night as we were attending a gig in the O2 Arena. The first thing we noticed when we got to our ground floor room was the damp patch in the ceiling corner. This plus the general feeling that the room had not been decorated in quite some time didn't bode well. For lunch we were treated to some over-priced and not very appetizing food but as we were on a tight schedule we really didn't have a choice in where to eat as the hotel is slightly isolated. After the gig we headed back to the hotel, as did quite a few of the other gig-goers. There was only one member of staff behind the reception/bar and he struggled to cope with the sudden influx of people. He was extremely helpful but he really needed help as he had to deal with check ins, bar service, food orders and room service orders all by himself. Once again the food we and other people ordered was very disappointing (and we only did so as there was nowhere else open at this time). I saw one person receive a &quot;meatball sandwich&quot; which consisted of reheated meatballs between two slices of soggy bread.The hotel is also located quite far from tube/dlr stations and right beside a building site. I know the hotel has no control over this but we were woken at 8:30am by intense building noise and the development is likely to be ongoing for a while.I was aware that this was a budget hotel but left feeling very disappointed. Especially after a very pleasant stay at the Manchester Ibis the night before."
7,864,"Aug 12 2009 	new manager dreadful service by the manager herself	we had been regulars for the past 4 years and always happy abouth the accommodation. Until this time! I was waitng to check in, and watched the receptionist making troubles to some french guests. I interfere, trying to help, and was kicked offby her, asking me stay out. I was rather disappointed and when I had to check in, thenshe was so impolite that I felt I might get a heart attack., If I had not known the hotel, I would have gone away. I asked to speak to the general manager, and she told me that she was the new appointed manager.I fortunately, knew some of the staff, and inquiring about the new manager, they confirmed that I was not the only guest to complain for dreadful service."
8,864,"Jun 6 2009	the best ever stay at Ibis Docklands--the best budget hotel	Stayed here over the bank holiday weekend. A very nice and clean hotel, which is in a very good location. It is close to the central london which is perfect even for night go out, and 5-minute walk to the canary wharf tube station which was very useful. We did have a problem when we arrived for twin room but then friendly receptionst especially the Manager who sort it out the problem by putting extra bed for us, though they don't do this normally.The breakfast was fantastic with so many different items, though they need to add some items in the hot buffet as there was more variety in cold buffet, which is really good value of money.The staff (Althea, Himani, Raj &amp; Narinder ) were very friendly and helped in everyway they could, especially Althea who even let me print my online borading passes using his own PC. We decided to do the tours and visits ourselves, and glad we did! Some of the brochure prices were too high - but the staff given us good information about the travelling and cheapest way to visit the best attractions of London for example London Pass and viewing from the boat as it passed, but did include lunch and probably a tour guide. There were other trips as well, which in my opinion can be done by yourself with a little help from the tourist information centres. You will save a lot of money if you put a little effort in ofcourse the hotel staff guided me for all this.We had a little hiccup at the end when checking out, where the system thought we owed them money even though I cleared the balance the night before - but I guess that was the computer system problem rather than a staff problem. In the end, it was all sorted. Apart from that, a great stay in a great budget hotel and I would definitely recommend to anyone. I am also become a memeber of A club."
9,864,"Jun 6 2009 	It was great!!! We had a good time there.	The staff was very friendly and helpfull, at arrival they offered us to provide a baby cot and at breakfast they brought a highchair to our baby. They gave us information about the city sightseeing as well. So they looked after us. The room was really clean and seemed new. The breakfast was fair, it was not expensive and we had buffet table choice. The location of the hotel was very good, the public transport was walking distance, it was great because we were with our baby."

Rooms are very basic but clean.The hotel is situated near to a very busy roundabout so our room was very very noisy with the window open.Breakfast once again is very basic and I had to ask many times for things as it seems they were struggling to keep up with restocking the food, cutlery, napkins etc.Parking is great though. Plenty of parking and costs just 5.00 for the day."
12,864,"May 4 2009 	Don't eat there!	Receptionist polite and friendly. I was tired after travelling, so elected to eat in the room. BIG mistake - the beef dish resembled dog food, and the frozen peas and carrots were still frozen in the middle. I should have gone to McDonalds across the road!Room was clean, though decor very tired and worn. Bathroom immaculately clean.Seemed to be lots of people complaining about various aspects of their stay (I counted 4 and I only stayed overnight!). I often use IBIS on overseas, and this is the worst one I've ever stayed in!"
13,864,"Mar 22 2009 	Good Buget hotel	Stayed when going to O2 for a concert, rooms clean &amp; tidy, staff friendly and helpful. Fine for an overnight but is a bit basic this is reflected in the rate which was very good for a London hotel"
14,864,"Mar 2 2009 	good value for a London hotel!	We stayed at the Docklands Ibis when we visited our son, who lived in Canary Wharf. We had previously stayed at the Brittania, a drab and depressing hotel which was twice the price. The Ibis cost us 58 for a clean, basic room with free parking. the bathroom was a pod but well planned and again very clean. I like staying just outside the city centre. The DLR is a few minutes away and travel into the centre is easy. The 'restaurant' is the foyer, but there are lots of good places to eat on the Wharf. We particularly like Carrlucio's, the Italian restaurant. There is a tunnel under the Thames, about a mile along the river path, which brings you up in Grenwich, a good place to walk for a late breakfast. The market at Grenwich has some good stalls for food as well. The champagne bar in the back of Waitrose makes shopping more fun too!We thought the Ibis was really good value for a London hotel; we have paid almost as much for parking when using the city centre!"
15,864,"Feb 23 2009 	Adequate but don't go for the food!	We visited London for the weekend and found the hotel basic but at a reasonable price. The rooms are of average size, but no views. (except of wasteland and very tall buildings) We have not visited London for a long time, but found getting to the hotel and around the city to be a painless experience. We both liked our food, but found eating in at the hotel to be very poor. There are some very good restaurants in Canary Wharf. Also we chose to have breakfast at McDonalds about 5min walk away. We wouldn't normally eat at McDonalds, but was a better choice than the one on offer at the hotel and cheaper too.All in all a cheap hotel 10 min walk from the LDR station ideal to connect to the underground system and the rest of London, providing you find somewhere else to dine."
16,864,"Jan 4 2009 	Clean and functional	Stayed here for a few nights as my husband was working in the area. Clean and functional, reasonable breakfast, helpful staff and within easy walking distance of Canary Wharf. We ate here in the evening once and the food was adequate, but the staff recommended a very nice pub up the road where we sat alongside the river overlooking the Dome and the food was lovely! As far as price and convenience are concerned this is a good hotel and with car parking too!"
17,864,"Sep 21 2008 	Cheap basic accomodations in the Docklands	We chose to stay at this hotel for 3 nights because we had family living close by. Although the price was good (50 pounds per night), we could definitely tell why it was so cheap!The room was very basic with a thin (but surprisingly comfy) mattress. The washroom resembled something I would find in a boat, complete with the unpleasant boat bathroom smell! It was like smelling a washroom holding tank everytime the toilet flushed or the water was running out of the tap. It was otherwise a clean room though and the staff was generally helpful and courteous. The location is decent, as the DLR stop is a few minutes walk away. It took about 30-40 minutes to get to Central London from there.I was not happy, however, when upon checking out, they tried to charge me 20 pounds for the use of a hair dryer as &quot;equipment rental&quot;. They did remove the charge when I challenged it, claiming it was a &quot;deposit&quot;. Also, I was told by the receptionist that it would cost 50pounds for a taxi to get to the airport, but when the taxi actually came, the driver told me that it would cost us 60pounds, because the hotel charged him 10pounds for the call. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you don't mind the distance from city and the small room and bathroom. Just be sure to check your bill and ask about any hidden costs!"
18,864,Aug 10 2008	Basic and efficent	This is a basic hotel and is fine if you just looking for a bed for a night at a reasonable cost. I had no complaints with staff or facilities and would stay there without hesitation but luxury it is not. It is out a bit from the centre of London but there is a tube station almost beside it. There seems to be nothing around it to see or do.
19,864,"Aug 6 2008 	Basic and noisy	Have stayed here a few times. A colleague has one of Ibis cards where he gets free rooms!Good things: Free car parking, clean, comfortable bedBad things: Noisy, basicNot the place for me, but can understand people using it."
20,864,"Jun 13 2008 	Good choice	We stayed here at the end of May as we were going to a concert at the o2. Check in was very quick, and the lady on the reception was very helpfull with advising us on the best way to get to the o2 as the Jubilee line was closed for maintenance work on the day we were there.The room was quite large, and the TV had some cable/freeview channels and some audio channels as well.The bathroom is great, it a sort of curved &quot;pod&quot; in the corner of the room, but it really is like the tardis, the shower was huge! You will need to take your own hairdryer though.The room/bathroom/sheets were all very clean and there are tea/coffee making facilities. The bed was a bit hard, but that really is a personal view as I like a softer mattress.We parked at the Hotel, and was charged only 3.50 for the overnight parking which was really cheap. I do not know why the previous &quot;poster&quot; was charged 12.00 for parking! We ate breakfast at the hotel the next morning, and this was 6.10 each. To be honest with you, it is not great value for money, but you do have to realise you are in central London. There is a choice of toast / croissants / bread rolls / sausages / a weird cheese and ham roll thingy / cereal / cheese portions / and fruit salad. Also the normal tea / coffee / apple and orange juice. You do eat in the reception area, the hotel does not have a seperate restaurant. It was no problem when we were there as it was so quiet, but i would not like to sit there eating if lots of people were checking in. If I stayed here again, I would walk over to Mcdonalds ( a 2 minute walk) and have breakfast there, as this would be better value.All in all, a good choice if you are going to Canary Wharf or Excel. Also really good for the o2. If you are going to the o2 from here, a good way to get there would be to get the DLR to canary wharf, walk down to the river ( 3-5min walk) and then get the Thames clipper boat from the Canary Wharf pier to the o2, it costs 1.50 on the DLR and 2.50 on the boat. You see a bit of London from the Thames. After the concert we got a taxi back to the hotel which cost 22.50.A good, budget place to stay, very clean."
21,864,"Jun 9 2008 	Great Value!!!	I really liked Ibis as it was great value for money, the bedrooms were clean, and it had a TV with all the channels. The location was great as well about 5 minutes walk away from the nearest DLR Station, it has a Mc Donalds opposite to it and all the chicken and chips shops (PFC's) near by. We had a view of Canary Wharf which was great, I believe other rooms have the view of the river Thames and also the o2 (dome) which is relatively nice.The check in staff were kind and welcoming and assisted us straight away there was no waiting around.All in all it was a pleasant place to stay probably not the most luxurious place but definitely has all the things you will need."
22,864,"May 3 2008 	Just Basic	Stayed here Friday 2nd May. room far too small, Breakfast a rip off @ 5 for a continental...no english breakfast available!then to add insult to injury you have to pay 12 for a 24 stay at the car park! Shower / toilet is like a step in street toilet resembling Dr Who's tardis. weird! Can only describe this hotel as Basic! nothing more and at the wrong end of London."
23,864,"Dec 22 2007 	I had it for free and would not stay there!	I had booked the hotel with a travel agency along with Bruce Springsteen tickets. To make a long story short we walked in and a very nice woman checked us in, we went to our room turned around and walked out. We went up the street and checked into the Raddison. The hotel is fine for a bunch of 18 year olds out drinking besides that type of group it is a total dump. It really is a place to be avoided."
24,864,"Nov 19 2007 	Good locatoin for Excel	Looking over the other mixed reviews it's clear that many people do not understand the concept of Ibis hotels. I did and as a result was quite surprised (pleasantly) with my stay.I chose this hotel purely to be close to Excel as it's just a few stops on the DLR and next to a station, the extra time this gave me was well worth the stay.The rooms are modern but trim and the bathroom is kind of like a capsule but it all works.Food was also OK but limited in terms of menu though the prices were good value for London.If you need a good clean room and a hot meal then this is a good choice."
25,864,"Oct 15 2007 	Your Basic Hotel	Was booked in at the IBIS hotel for three days for on a work related visit. We got to the hotel quite late as it happened around 12 at night. The reception area looked quite nice but there was only one person on the reception desk who was apparently also the only barman on duty. Eventually got a mix up regarding the payment sorted out and got to my room which was comfortable if somewhat basic. There was only a continental breakfast on offer in the mornings which wasn't exactly ideal but it was only a small complaint really. Overall i didn't spend too much time at the hotel but the time i was there i found it to be a nice enough hotel which was quiet comfortable also., i had been a bit worried after reading the previous reviews on the place but i was pleasantly surprised."
26,864,"Sep 29 2007 	Reception from hell.	Had a late evening arrival at hotel for overnight stay. Staffing of reception was poor with only one person to check in as well as manning the bar and telephones. Eventually it took me 20 mins in queue to be checked in. Reception not very polite including wrong information on paying for stay. Finally got to room which was basic, including the caravan wash area. Other colleagues with me complained about the smell &amp; cleanliness of their rooms and the noise in general. Great view from bedroom window of Canary Wharf which was only highlight. Breakfast area poor and preferred to go to MacDonalds than pay the overinflated price of what looked like a very average breakfast. Overall, not a pleasant experience and would not stay here again."
27,864,Sep 4 2007 	SHORT TUBE RIDE TO DOME	If you want to stay somewhere cheap and near to the 02(dome) This is a good choice.Small basic hotel but very clean and the most comfortable bed i have slept in .Shower room a bit like Dr Who's tardis .Clever room planning to give you a bit more space.Nice flat screen television.Free parking ...a big plus.It is a couple of stops on tube to 02 .We eat out at Canary wharf (WHICH YOU CAN WALK TO) and then went over to the dome.All really close. If you walk out of the hotel you can see the dome right in front of you on the other side of the river.good photo opportunityCan't fault the hotel at all.
28,864,"Aug 20 2007 	clean room but unhelpful staff and lack of amenities	i booked a double room in this hotel as it was billed as being very near to the O2 arena. when i checked in, i wasnt told that there were no double rooms available (Despite having paid for one) and was given my room key. i felt that i should have been told they were giving me a Twin Room instead of the double i had booked.The room was clean, well insulated from noise and had a powerful shower. however, no basics were provided e.g. toothpaste, hairdryer.The hotel was billed as being &quot;very near to the 02 arena&quot;. my taxi from the hotel to the arena cost 18 one-way so i feel this description is an exaggeration. However, i have to compliment the hotel on a tasty and plentiful buffet breakfast."
29,864,"Jun 12 2007 	Excellent Hotel	Ok first of all, I wasn't sure weather I should stay at this hotel, after I read some negative reviews on this site. However, being a stone throw away from Canary Wharf where I was on an assignment, I thought I'd give it a shot. There was complimentary car parking included, wifi fi access throughout the hotel, flat screen TV's in the rooms and a very friendly team of staff. I stayed at Ibis docklands for a week and I will return and recommend it to all my friends and family. East London is rough, but I did not see one instance of trouble during the week. All I saw was men and women in suits and some builders, who came in a for a beer after work.If you are going to be working in Canary Wharf, visiting O2 dome for a concert or visiting Excel for a conference, this is the right hotel without shelling out ridiculous prices charged by the likes of Hilton and Holiday Inn."
30,864,"Apr 10 2007 	Checked in ... checked out	Wrong room type reserevd, unhelpful staff and generally the most depressing building I've set foot in - need I say more? I didn't stayand checked into the Hilton down the road instead. If you can afford it I'd advise anyone to do the same."
31,864,Apr 8 2007 	This hotel is rough 	We arrived at this hotel after travelling on the DLR. We had to travel under two busy roads and through two underpasses. Our first comment would be dont go out at night as there are youths with hoodies verywhere. A few stood on a bridge and tried to spit on our heads as we walked underneath. The hotel is very smokey and there is not a separate restaurant. You eat and drink in a small area adjacent to the reception desk. There is no security and anyone from the street can walk into the hotel and access the rooms. We had an awful night as a bunch of youths had booked two rooms and spent all night slamming doors and running up and down the hall between the two rooms shouting &amp; some were half naked. A number of hooded youths were also seen entering the hotel and going into these rooms. We complained three times to the hotel before these youths were finally ejected at 4.15am. We did not sleep or feel safe in this hotel. We would not recommend this hotel. We have stayed in Ibis hotels in the past and found them a very good basic hotel but this one is the exception to the rule. We would also point out that the rooms are very small and the ensuite looks like a portable plastic bathroom from a caravan. There are no baths in this hotel only showers. We could not wait to leave.
32,864,"Jan 2 2007 	Wanted to leave Immediately	This Hotel is located beside a main road and some apartments, there is a local pub opposite the Hotel but that is it for local amenities unless you drive. As my taxi pulled up outside and I pulled my bag through the little gate to enter the Hotel my first impressions werent good and they proceeded to get worse. As I entered I was hit with a stink of cigarette smoke, I'm not used to it coming from Ireland but still it was too much to bear! There is no separate reception area or bar / lounge / restaurant its all one space! The reception desk is part of the food service area but just at the far end. The woman who checked me in had a stained T-shirt on with a hole in it she had obviously been working in the back kitchen and wasnt dressed for front of house. The lounge/seating area doubles up as the bar and sat at several tables were single men nursing pints and smoking. Very lonely looking sight and unnerving as a single female business traveller. The room was stark and almost bare with a small double bed low to the ground covered by a single blanket and bedspread and one pillow although there was an extra blanket and pillow available. The bathroom was small and basic but spotless and had a good shower unit. For the positives the place was clean and there were complimentary magazines in the lobby. This is a low price Hotel but honestly its not worth what they are charging."
33,864,Nov 21 2006 	Very Noisy	The hotel was what I expected basic but the room was a little bigger than I expected. The main problem was the location by a very large roundabout. So after being woken up at 6:30 with the traffic I had no chance of getting back to sleep. I was on the side of the main road of which there is two. Maybe facing the front will be less noisy.
34,864,"Aug 26 2006	Good for what it is	I needed a hotel for an overnight stay in the docklands for an early morning meeting.This hotel served the purpose admirably. It's clean, accessible, and near to public transport.A perfectly good hotel, but nothing special."
35,864,Jul 23 2006 	Not Good	Well just returned from one nights stay at this hotel and compared to the IBIS euston this is far inferior.ProsIs right off Dcklands Light Railway service so its about a 3 min walk.Bedroom clean and nice spacious bathroom which looks something outta Star Trek.ConsStaff not intrested in filling you in about hotel. ie lift is behind you breakfast is served at various times.Had difficulty trying to explain i wanted an iron and had to tell him where it was located.Receptionist on checking out was trying to deal with 3 people at once although it was not busy.No-one knows how to smile.was charged nearly double the price of weekend rate room because it was &quot;MOTOR WEEK&quot;.i would probably recommend the Euston Branch as for me ill be going back to the Mariott in Kensington much better place
36,864,"Mar 1 2005	Frequent guest here	This hotel is a great value for the money if you get the special internet rate of about USD70. We've stayed here four times. The location is out of the way, but the hotel is new, clean, staff treated us great, and you can check in as early aw 7:30 AM, which is great if you have flown all night from the states. Ask and you get the hairdryer, and the Tube is a short walk away. Nothing really around the hotel, but not a too long tube to the city. Very clean rooms and furnishings, nice bed and bright cheerful. You will not be disappointed at the rate - great value for the price!"
37,864,"Jan 11 2005	Oh Dear!!!!	This is the most miserable place I have ever had the misfortune to stay!!!!. Due to work committments I have stayed in this hotel several times, and I have to say considering the location and the room rate it is horrible. The staff are unfreindly the place is not particularly clean and it is overpriced for a budget hotel.Keep looking!!!!"
38,864,"Jul 17 2009 	""Muy mal hotel. Sucio alejado del centro y personal desagradable"""
1,868,Nov 7 2009 	disappointing	Have stayed in much better budget hotels. Changed my room twice in one night after strong smell of tobacco. Finally settled in the 3rd room. Windows did not close properly so was noisy and difficult to sleep. Room looked dark and miserable with towels large enough for a toddler. Toilet seat was broken but couldnt be bothered to have room changed or anymore hassle. No parking was problematic but understandable due to its location. Breakfast was not bad but was irritating to be asked every morning if I have signed the register whilst eating and having just signed it!
2,868,"Nov 2 2009 	Value? Yes. Quality? Not what I expect from Ibis	Generally, Ibis hotel rooms all seem to be much of a muchness. Its as if they all come off a conveyor belt in a giant hotel factory somewhere. But the rooms here fell short of the usual standard  the AC unit wasnt functioning on a warm, humid night and the window didnt close properly, resulting in noise coming in from the busy street outside. On the upside the hotel is reasonably priced and around 5 minutes walk from Stratford tube/DLR station. However there is no dedicated customer car park (the nearest alternative is the multi-storey at the local shopping centre at additional cost) and the noise from people, sirens and traffic outside resulted in a rather sleepless night."
3,868,"Aug 3 2009 	Very clean and very convenient	The location is very convenient. We chose the hotel because we were going to Excel for the Triathlon and found it also very practical to go to Central London (tube is direct). Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms are not very large but I was positively impressed by the cleanliness. Funny bathroom, like a cabin."
4,868,"Jul 10 2009 	Good hotel but they have a cockroach problem	My husband and I stayed at the Ibis and the staff were really nice, the room was clean and it was quiet in the hotel, although it was full. In the morning I came across a cockroach in the shower and another on on the bedside table next to the shower drainage. Thankfully not too many to freak out about, but it was a shock."
5,868,"May 11 2009 	Efficient clean and nice hotel.	I traveled with my husband and our 1 year old child. We did not have any problem. The hotel was clean, staff was helpful. The room was simple and nice. There is even a possibility to make tea or coffee in your room, the kettle (and instant coffee, tea bags, sugar, milk and cups) are in disposition. The hotel is not situated in the centre, but connection is very good, the underground is just few minutes by walk. I liked best: cleanness, kettle in the room, clean towels every day.I disliked: lift out of order, high chair for baby (during breakfast) was not very clean."
6,868,"May 10 2009 	Excellent value for money	Had stayed in this hotel for more than a month and never found it boring. Good location, with quick access to underground station. Excellent spacious room with all required aminities. Friendly staff always eager to help and make you feel comfortable. Room was nicely cleaned and all requirements were taken careof. The buffet beakfast was excellent with a good choice of continental food. Good location in the town centre but yet the rooms were very quiet without any disturbance.Would definitely recommend this one."
7,868,"Apr 30 2009 	No parking at this hotel	Clean and functional hotel with good sized rooms compared to some in the Ibis chain. Our only gripe was that there is no parking whatsoever and the receptionist was vague about where we could park. Either on street meter parking some way from the hotel or in the nearby shopping centre. It was a bit a a drag to have to drive round late at night to find somewhere to leave the car. For this reason, we wouldn't choose this Ibis again. The only other thing was the fire alarm going off at 3 in the morning. Not the best night's sleep! Bed comfortable and good breakfast though!"
8,868,"Jan 30 2009 	Nice hotel in Stratford	I had to stay for a couple of days near Excel for the World Tourism Fair, but unfortunatelly all the hotels near Excel were fully booked. My best option was getting a room in Ibis at Stratford which I got a reservation quite easy along with my friend Moha.Ibis has about the same quality all over the world, perfect and extensive breakfast, clean and useful rooms.Staff at the reception were quite nice and were quite fast bringing me another extra blanket.Some people don't like big chain hotels like Ibis, but, in my humble opinion, Ibis hotels are easy and clean, something I sometimes search."
9,868,"Aug 11 2008	Could not sleep at night room smells of smoke.	I was disappointed with the rooms which had bad smoke odour. I had to change rooms on the first night but the second room also had smoke odour. I used the air condition at night hoping the smell would go away but the system emmitted smoke resulting my partner and I choking and a bad nights sleep. The manager wasn't keen on compensating us for this discomfort. The hotel should take strict measures so that hotel clients do not break the law by smoking in rooms.Overall - great value, staff friendly but I didn't like the neighbourhood. I personally won't stay at this particular Ibis again but would consider other branches."
10,868,"Jun 25 2008 	Hated It!	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in! It's in a cool neighborhood, but the staff were rude and made mistakes along every step of the way in our stay. They are slow to do anything and fix their mistakes. Not one of them was pleasant and friendly and we got the impression that we should be grateful that they were allowing us to stay. Only positve personal was the cleaning lady! She smiled and said hello every morning. Also, we had a room in the back where all the deliveries for the restaurant and local supermarket were made. Nice to hear the trucks at 3 in the morning! It may be cheaper, but not worth the aggravation. Going to contact the company next."
11,868,"Aug 8 2007 	Clean and as expected	Not fancy but perfectly acceptable. Very clean and modern. Staff was helpful. This is definitely a budget hotel, but we were very pleased with this and every other Ibis we stayed at on our trip!"
12,868,"Nov 17 2006 	GREAT VALUE!!	I was surprised to stay in this hotel paying only 40 pounds per night! It's an excellent hotel with a large room, nice double bed. The design of toilet was interesting which is cylindrical! it's such a nice hotel should rank above 3 stars. However, the promotion was gone and now it costs 58 pounds per night. That's a bit expensive as breakfast is not included. If your budget is not tight, it's really a nice place to stay, especially for businessman. The environment outside is nice as well. And it's close to the tube station , just around 7 minutes walk. There is a shopping mall nearby as well. Good location and excellent accomodation. Recommended!"

1,881,"5 star staff	After travelling for 13 hours from a trip abroad i decided to stay in London for the night. I looked online for a hotel near Angel station and this one was the nicest one i could see in my price range. I arrived at the hotel at 10:15 am with the intention of just dropping off my case as i was well before check in time. After mentioning to the staff that i have just been on an 13 hour flight they found me a room and let me check in so i could get some rest and freshen up. I felt they went that bit extra which made my day. The room was lovely, very spacious and clean. It had everything i need and was very comfortable at a very reasonable price."
2,881,"Nov 24 2009 	Great location average hotel	I chose to stay at Jury's hotel in Islington because of the location. The hotel is very close to the tube station &amp; there are lots of great resturants/shops etc located nearby in Upper Street.This was the first time I have stayed in a Jury's hotel. I thought it was a little basic, similar to what you would expect in a travel lodge, however I would most definetly stay again. I paid 370 for 3 nights 2 people B&amp;B through travelrepublic.com.Reception staff were very good &amp; check in very swift. Our room was available on arrival at 10am - a big thumbs up! The room was clean, but the bathroom a little shabby. The shower, as mentioned in a previous review, isn't great, but does the job for a short term. Ladies beware - the hairdryer does not do the job at all - its next to useless! Make sure you bring your own. I did ask at reception if they had a handheld one, but unfortunately not! The bed was a little hard, but i think complaining about it is being a little pedantic!There was a good choice at breakfast time, however we found the food to be quite bland. There was a delay in food being replenished, which was a little bit of an iritant.I would definetly recommend this hotel, as long as the price is right &amp; your expectations aren't too high!!"
3,881,"Nov 17 2009 	Good for groups ideal for stag/hen or friends	Date of stay November 13th-15th 2009There were around 20 of us staying at the Jury's on this particular weekend. Certainly the hotel is ideally placed 200 yards from the Angel tube on the Northern Line just one station along from King's Cross.Check in on Friday around 5pm proved smooth, decent sized room, flat screen Samsung TV set, toiletries for use in the bathroom were of good quality (shower gel, conditioner) In our room, a double and a single, and in other friend's rooms this was repeated so Jury's are certainly geared up for the party booking trade.Relatively quiet environment too, as our room faced the back courtyard.Facilities on site seemed reasonably, had to laugh at the vending machine which dispensed essentials such as razors, playing cards, toothpaste, toothbrushes! Breakfast at the weekend is a leisurely affair, serving until 11am (certainly very much appreciated on a stag weekend!) as was the 12.00noon check out time, thumbs up to Jury's for this. The self service Breakfast room was slightly crowded around the peak time. Foods on offer were excellent, with a great selection of continental and traditional cooked foods, breads, cereals. However, some of the foodstuffs did run out and took a few minutes to be replenished by the staff during the very busy periods which resulted in a couple of queues. Plus be warned, the normal tea bags are already placed in the pots, so don't do what I did and hunt round where the selection of around 12 other flavoured teas were!Staff were generally friendly, certainly very efficient. For our booking, the room cost 190 for two nights, certainly very affordably if 3 are sharing.I would visit this hotel again."
4,881,"Nov 11 2009 	Disappointed	Having prevouisly stay at Jurys in Watford and Liverpool, I was looking forward to staying at the Islington hotel on business. However I couldn't have been more wrong, from the outside the hotel looked grand and welcoming along with the reception. Howver once i enter my room, i felt like i have entered a hotel room back in the 60's. The room certainly was not what i am use to with the Jurys brand. Firstly I was a young women travelling alone and they located me a room on the first floor, which is not the normal policy for the hotel. Secondly the beds had no sheets on them, the bathroom sink was dirty and had a cracked in and the bathroom was shabby and old. Finally the gap under the door was concerning. I could see peoples feet outside my door and could put my hands under the door on top of one another 4 times. Being a young lone women i found the gap under the door concerning. I was told at receptoion that there was no more rooms on either nights i was staying and haad to make do with the room i had. Also i was told that the bed was made up to hotel standards which i know was incorrect. The staff at the hotel was adverage until they found out while i was staying at the hotel they could not be more helpfull however i still had t make do with the room."
5,881,"Nov 9 2009 	Shabby but cheap in London terms	I stayed here for three nights last month. The room I got was small and shabby. Although I only paid 79GBP per night , I felt the overall standard of the room to be less than that of a travelinn, or even an Ibis. I had a mail from the manager saying they were planning a refurb, but I still thing the whole experience was a bit poor. I was awakened at 6am by the receptionist asking if I had ordered a taxi. I can only guess whether he phoned every room in the hotel asking the same question.I would be reluctant to stay there again, but would try the Hilton at Angel, or travelinn Euston instead."
6,881,Oct 26 2009 	Overall hotel was good but 'seriously' lacking in room security.	The location was good for sightseeing and shopping. The rooms were nicely sized and clean. The breakfast was generous with a wide variety of hot and cold choices to suit all tastes and very fresh. These are the best reasons to stay at this hotel but the main reason for not returning would be the 'serious' lack of room security that we experienced the day we checked out. This was sadly disappointing as it spoiled our stay at the hotel and our overall visit to London and would not encourage me to return in future.
7,881,"Oct 26 2009 	Excellent vaue for money	I was sceptical of this hotel at first as the reviews on this hotel made me think that the Jurys Inn Islington was an average hotel. However I was not disappointed. Lets get the minor negatives out of the way first: You dont get biscuits in your room You dont get an iron in your room as standard (you have to request one from reception) The Mira showers lacked any serious power The decor of the bathrooms and the corridors were very green &amp; basic but very cleanThe positives: The hotel was very close to Angel Tube station on the Northern line There were plenty of shops , restaurants &amp; bars including a Weatherspoon's in case you wanted to eat out The rooms themselves were of a very high standard in terms of size, decor &amp; cleanliness Each room had Samsung LCD TVs with all the freeview channels on The bar had Sky sports The food standards in the bar &amp; restaurant were excellent &amp; all respectably priced. Although my employers picked up the tab for my 5 day stay, no matter how hard I tried, I could not exceed 25 on my evening meal bill despite having a 3 course meal &amp; two drinks Breakfast was 8.50 per head buffet &amp; they did a good range of English hot &amp; cold food Hotel check-in and check-out is lightening fastIf I ever visit London again I would certainly consider bringing my family here as this hotel provides great value for money without feeling you have compromised."
8,881,"Oct 21 2009 	Very comfortable	Having stayed here briefly last month, I booked for four days through Lastminute. I have nothing but praise. As promised, we now get many Freeview channels and there is SkySports in the bar. There is a large comfortable lounge if you need more space. I slept as well as I ever do and the hotel was always clean and fully functioning. Good water pressure and a very acceptable breakfast buffet as part of the lastminute deal. I will definitely be booking in here for my next visits to London. If you like good thin-crust pizza, find Pizzeria Oregano down a lane off Upper Street."
9,881,"Sep 24 2009 	Meets the brief for a business trip	Welcome was friendly and a request for a quiet room granted (I got one at the back as opposed to the front which was over the road - although the double glazing would probably have coped.The room was standard business class, broadband available at a small fee, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom needed updating however. It took a wet towel and a lot of effort to turn the shower on (maybe a strong armed bloke may not have struggled as much as I did!). There was a strange doorstop (aka trip-hazard) in the middle of the floor but I managed to avoid it!The hotel has a restaurant and bar but no room service which is a pity as I would have used it. The breakfast buffet at 8.50 is reasonably priced for London and seemed to offer a comprehensive range of breakfast fare. All in all, the hotel is good value for money, particularly considering the central (ish) location not far from Kings Cross."
10,881,"Sep 22 2009 	Good for the money.	I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend on a siteseeing trip to london. I know the area of islington very well, and this was the cheapest hotel availible. It was 90pn B and B on laterooms.com. In terms of value for money, the room was very clean and tidy and the breakfast was a fantastic hot buffet affair. The Reception supervisor when we checked in was very helpful - we requested to pay for the room up front in cash because I didnt want to be walking around with all that money in my purse - this was not a problem. They also had a secure luggage room for us to put our bags in until we checked in.My only quip was when we were checking out and the Trainee Receptionist was dealing with us. I presented my receipt from check in and was told that we were on a 95pn deal and we owed another 10. Having only budgeted a certain amount for travelling home - I was horribly embaressed. I asked for my room key back and went upstairs to bin hoke for my confirmation letter which I had thrown out thinking that i didnt need it. After all the hassle, when I came back down to the lobby she told me everything was okay. I just think it was a situation that could have been avoided, it made her look incompetent and me look cheap. As a receptionist in a hotel myself, I know the importance of having staff on the desk who know what they are doing, personally I think check outs should be supervised.All in all though, fab hotel with Angel and Kings Cross tube station nearby. I would stay there again."
11,881,"Sep 20 2009 	Adequate for our needs	This hotel is nestled away in Islington not more than 5 minutes away from the Tube station Angel. Our visit was short and sweet with us staying 2 nights at this hotel. Our room was adequate for our needs, but it didn't blow us away. It was a rather dull room when the lights went on, not representative of the photos posted on Trip Advisor which are very bright.We stayed on the 2nd floor of this building - which in itself is of no consequence, but we did detect on every time we exited onto this floor the strong smell of TCP/ disinfectant. This smell didn't continue into our room, but we always wondered where this odour came from.Although the hotel says it comes with Satellite TV beware as this consists of less channels than you would get on a normal free-view box! - 5 terrestrial channels, Sky 1, BBC News and TMF (music channel) - not exactly what I was expecting.The bed was pretty good and the sheets nice and soft, unlike some hotels where they can be like cardboard.We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room had a large bathroom, which is rare for a centrally located London hotel. The rooms are also serviced with Wireless internet, but it's not free. ~5 per day to use these facilities - which isn't all that good when there are many hundreds of free wireless hotspots about the city.Breakfast was a bit of a joke for us, when we got downstairs on morning 1 we decided to go with the continental breakfast, rather than upgrade to the cooked breakfast for a further 2.50. There was plenty of cereal to be had, but the pastry counter was a bit bereft of any savoury goods. There were some mini croissants, but no danishs or other goodies to be had. Morning 2 we decided to go elsewhere for breakfast.All in all this hotel was perfectly functional for us to get to and for us to tour the city. Its convenience to the tube sold it to us when we booked this trip ages ago. Its only downfall in our eyes was the breakfast for us, but in itself it is not a deal breaker as there are plenty of eateries open very close to the Angel tube stop."
12,881,"Sep 19 2009 	Nice hotel great hotel no parking	Needed to go to London of a business trip. HQ booked us this hotel. It's not easy to find if you are driving and do avoid trying to get there around 5pm. We took 1 1/2 hrs to drive 6 miles. Hotel has no parking, so you have only 3 temporary spaces to drop off cases and then drive 1/2 mile to a pay car park which will cost me 18 a night. You then walk back to the hotel. If it was rainign and you had a nice suit..... The hotel however is fine. Large clean spacious rooms and quiet location. Air Con means you don't roast to death like some travel lodges as the windows only open 3 cms. Conveniently situated near Angel tube station if you want to go into the city for the evening. The breakfast was superb! Every food imaginable from fruit to fry up. Could have stayed all morning just to eat.... I would stay there again."
13,881,Sep 11 2009 	excellent all the way	what can i say to describe jurys only excellent ..rooms are grand and very clean ..i was actually amazed at the breakfast it was so fresh and convienent lovely bacon best i ever had ... wee lady in centre of breakfast dock not very chatty but mybe i got her on a bad day all other staff so friendly .... this is so handy for the o2 islington as my daughter went to see paramore ... we ate 2 nights in jurys bar food again faultless thank you staff ..my only little thing to say to manager /laundry ...and its not a very bad complaint is the towels let the lovely rooms down they are greyish and not hotel fluffy standard mybe a litttle softner /whitner can be advised to laundry .... all in all we will be back as it is so handy for the tube into london thank you all xxx
14,881,"Sep 2 2009 	Clean safe and friendly!	Stayed here with my young daughter and it's a new building, if not a little soulless, it's clean and the staff were (nearly) all very helpful. Adequate sized rooms with A/C. Buffet breakfast was very good. It turned out my FULL breakfast was only a &quot;Continental&quot; affair so be careful, although I was told it's only 2.50 to upgrade. Very handy for The Angel tube station and a safe area. Recommended."
15,881,"Sep 2 2009 	Excellent location for Sadlers Wells and night in town	The room was comfortable and of reasonable size. Bathroom was dated, but clean. The water didn't run away down the sink too well, but we reported this when leaving. Good choice at breakfast and waitress was happy to get the kitchen to make porridge for my husband. Excellent location for staying in London after going to Sadlers Wells Theatre."
16,881,"Sep 1 2009 	Sad insitutional and smelly	Outside appearance- modern city hotel. Once past reception, the decor is 1970's insitutional and the smell of disinfectant, permeating the corridors and and our room, reminds one of a Salvation Army hostel in Stepney. Stained carpets, dirty towels and noise of slamming doors for most of the night only add to this impression.Accepting that London hotesls are always expensive, this is still poor value even for our capital city."
17,881,"Aug 24 2009 	Tired and Dated	Spent one night here and was really disappointed with the room. Not up to other Jury Inn standards with faulty fixtures and fittings. Had to be moved to another room because the whb plug wouldn't budge from the closed position (reception opened it using brute force and suggesetd, as I was just staying for one night, we should just not close it).She did, however, agree to move us when I explained I considered that solution to be unacceptable.Car parking a good 5 minutes away and very costly - 30 overnight stay!Good location and close to trendy Islington but I would wait for the promised re-fit before using the hotel!"
18,881,"Aug 18 2009 	very good hotel 2nd visit	stayed here in feb for a theatre trip ,and again in august for 2 nights,great location good for travel on the underground and a nice clean hotel, lovely bathrooms soft white towels changed daily,shampoo and shower gels in good supply,tea and coffee supplied,ice making machines in corridors ,air conditioning kept the rooms lovely and cool. will be going back for 3rd visit .have stayed in hotels that charge more and are no where near as good as this one."
19,881,"Aug 15 2009 	Great location and service	The hotel is greatly located. Islington is a lively area of London. Lot's of restaurants, bars and nice shops. It is trendy and artsy, no snob feeling around the neighborhood.We took the subway from Heathrow all the way to the Angel Station (2 blocks from the hotel).The room was nicely decorated and very clean. The service excellent. The front desk staff gave us great tips about buses, restaurants and things to do (our two favorite places to eat: Origano Italian restaurant - great pizza and pastas - the real deal and Le Mercury a super affordable great French restaurant) There is a bus stop across the street from the hotel so it is very convenient if you want to hop on one of the many buses that go around the townThere is no cable tv in the room but who goes to London to watch tv?Breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good.We recommend if you are going with friends, partner and kids"
20,881,"Jul 31 2009 	Excellent location. VERY attentive service	We stayed here for the weekend and found the place perfect for our needs. The front staff is very helpful and the room suited us well. I had emailed ahead of time requesting a quiet room and got one overlooking the center parking/utility lot that was incredibly quiet. The room had a double and single bed which was spacious enough for the three of us. The place was spotless. Breakfast was a bit chaotic but included a good selection of food (cereal, yougurt, fresh fruit, cheese, bread, eggs, meats, beans, tomatoes, etc). Our rate included the full breakfast for the three of us for 90 pounds per night. Half of our party was arriving via Eurostar and we all went to Paris the same way at the end of the weekend so the location was great. The hotel is closer to the Angel stop, which does often require transfers to get where you may wish to go, but since it's only a few blocks away, in a very safe neighborhood, it was fine. The Kings Cross/Pancras stop is a longer walk but still convenient. (If you are arriving with luggage though, definitely transfer to get to Angel so you walk less with your baggage!)I would definitely stay there again on a future trip to London. This property offers a lot for the money."
21,881,"Jul 27 2009 	Good hotel - quite pleased!	Stayed here for 2 nights last weekend.Location was great for us - right near Angel Tube - lots of places to eat and drink near here too!We booked through Last Minute and got it as one of the mystery hotels - 138 for 2 nights. The room was good size. It was clean as was the bathroom but could possibly do with a bit of a revamp. Only complaint was not enough pillows and we had to ask for the kettle to be replaced, which the front desk organised for us.When we came to check in, it was very early (about 8.30am) - we just really wanted to leave our baggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in there and then which was fantastic for us! Front desk were brilliant.Can't complain at all really - I'd consider staying again!"
22,881,"Jul 23 2009 	Good basic and clean room in a fantastic location	I stayed at Jury's Inn Islington as part of a Trafalgar tour, one night at the beginning of our tour and a second night at the end of our tour, so we experienced two different rooms. The lobby is very nice; the rooms are typical for the UK, on the small side with rather stiff beds, but very clean. The walls are thin, as were all the walls of all the hotels we stayed in throughout the UK, and our window in the first room wouldn't close properly so we had street noise from the pub below into the early hours. The regular continental breakfast wasn't the best we had either. But other then these minor occurrences, we were satisfied with the hotel.The pub located in the hotel is very good, the food was reasonably priced. For all of you first timers to the UK, if you want food or drinks in a pub, you need to order at the bar. There is usually a number on your table and you'll want to let the bartender know this number so the food can be brought to your table.The best part of this hotel is the location. The Angel underground station is two blocks away, if you are leaving the hotel, turn left and go down two blocks to the light, you'll see Angel station on your left. There was an Assistance Desk with a clerk at the tube to assist us with buying tickets. The neighborhood of Islington has so much to offer, just a few blocks away you'll find every type of restaurant imaginable, Asian cuisines, vegetarian, Italian, Mexican, sandwiches, etc. There are several pubs within walking distance as well, all down Angel Street.One thing I would recommend to the manager, although the hotel has WiFi internet access available to those with their own laptops, there was no central computer that visitors could use. Most other hotels we stayed at had one and I found them very convenient.Overall, the hotel met our needs and we would definitely stay here again."
23,881,"Jul 20 2009 	Jury's Islington Good But...	Visited Jury's Islington June 2009, had two teens with us, they were kind enough to accomodate with a foldaway bed, quickly, effeciently and at no cost, good job. Location:-Good location very handy for St Pancras (Eurostar) and Euston and or Kings Cross all walking distance 15 minutes to Euston/Kings Cross, taxi from St Pancras 10 GBP. To get into Central London get a taxi or if you have time use the Tube from Angel (Northern Line) not much use, better yet go to Kings Cross Tube and access central London tubes.Hotel:-Clean, Newish, nice lobby, no parking at front only short stay loading. Reception were quick and effecient and helpful as needed.Room: Small , two double beds, good bathroom, plenty of towels when requested, TV in room is poor and they should by now have upgraded to a flat screen, furniture OK. Enough room for four 4 persons in room.Restaurant:Breakfast was good value, full English for 8.50 GBP, perhaps a little steep and I would recommend getting good value for that price (load up), numerous local pubs/cafes do full English for 6 GBP or less, shop around don't just stumble into the restaurant, which was kept clean throughout the staff do a good job keeping everything clean and tidying up after guests.Overall good stay, useful for business visitors, downside often stacked with Tour parties who overrun the restaurant for breakfast, though this didn't happen during our stay."
24,881,Jul 6 2009 	Good hotel	Stayed here for work - easy to find off the tube station - room large and clean - breakfast good - lots of choice - bar in hotel pleasant.
25,881,"Jul 6 2009 	50 th birthday trip	my husband and i stayed there 2 wks ago FOR 2 NIGHTS.i was very dissappointed on the size of the roomsmy husband had to step into the shower, to close the bathroom door, to get to the toilet which was situtated behind the door.we booked through expedia and we had no breakfast ,but i felt the room was a BOX.it wasnt a special offer."
26,881,"Jul 1 2009 	Bargain!	I was at this hotel for one night a few days ago. Got a deal of 90 including breakfast for 2 people) Could not believe that we could have got a bargain for such a central hotel. Rooms were spotless, although could do witha bit of a revamp. That said I will definately be back to this hotel in 6 weeks on my return home. Staff first class by the way!!!"
27,881,"Jun 25 2009 	Perfect location and friendly staff	We stayed in the Jurys Inn Islington hotel due to the marriage of a friend of mine. The location is perfect (at least for us). Its not far of the city centre, but more important: the area around the hotel is a very nice one. Restaurants and bars are located a few minutes walk from the hotel. The breakfast suits well for a busy day. We had the English breakfast and this hotel knows whats part of an english breakfast.Last but not least: the staff of this hotel was very friendly and helpful."
28,881,"Jun 12 2009 	Pretty Good!	The Jury's Inn was the first stay of our trip around Europe. Pretty good stay!It was a package deal that came along with some Arsenal Match day tickets. Very good location and close to Angel station. Only advice is some people say walk from Kings Cross Station, DONT! Particulary if you have just had a long flight! Much better to head to Angel.Rooms quite comfy, no problems here!From listening around most packages come with a Continental package instead of breakfast. Staff will not tell you how much it is to upgrade to buffet, you do need to ask them (because its cheap to do so) and very worth it! Nice Brekky!Only downer is that we wanted to stay all of our time in London at Jury's but the cost just got too much. But all-round pretty good!"
29,881,"Jun 11 2009 	Great stay!	Stayed at Jurys Inn last week and I must say that it exceeded our expectations in terms of what our perception of what 3 star budget hotels are about. although rooms are dated we found our one to be spacious, clean , well maintained and quiet - bearing in mind we were in a busy part of london. Plenty of restaurants and bars in the area so we ate out two nights and had dinner in the Hotel one night. Took buses from Angel Tube stop nearby that took us in to Picadilly and Oxford Street within about 25 minutes. Would definately stay here on our next visit!"
30,881,"Jun 10 2009 	Very good for what we needed and paid for	The two major things we were looking for were good location and comfortable and safe place to sleep and leave our belongings. The location was excellent, as it's very close to the Angel tube stop and about a 15 minute walk to Kings Cross. There was an internet cafe right down the street that we used frequently and a Sainsbury (large grocery store) and many restaurants/shops nearby. The room was fine, nothing spectacular, but clean and comfortable. Apparently all the rooms have a couch/day bed type thing, which was nice so we'd have somewhere to sit besides the bed while watching TV or reading or such. The furniture is a bit dated, but for what we paid, I was pleased. The room was pretty spacious (lots of room to put your belongings with shelving and such), though I don't know if 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 kids could share it comfortably, as the website advertises it. Overall the room was clean (bed, furniture, carpet, bathroom). The only thing that wasn't were the glasses and coffee cups provided, but we used the styrofoam cups provided next to the ice machine. The ice machine on our floor broke on the first day there, and we told the hotel staff about it but it wasn't fixed before we left (we stayed 6 nights), which was inconvenient. There are no in-room safes, but there are safes in the lobby for guest use (accessible 24 hours with your own key the hotel gives you). We never tried the restaurants, as we were only there to sleep and shower. The staff was friendly. Overall, I'd say it's about on par with a La Quinta or Ramada Inn. Again, for what we paid and what we wanted in a hotel, I was very pleased."
