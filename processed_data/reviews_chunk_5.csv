59,193,"Sep 18 2008 	Great place to stay!	After a few bad choice hotels in the downtown Chicago area - I finally found one I would return to!I stayed here on business Aug '08 for a Cubs game. We booked 3 rooms - 1 for myself - 1 for a co worker - 1 for a customer.Everyone was very pleased. It was super convenient to everything. Even the subway was right downstairs (which, normally, we take a cab to Wriglyville - however, it was 5pm on a tuesday and we knew it would take extra long in traffic - highly reccommended!) The restaurant/bar downstairs is very nice - everyone was very friendly. However, it does close fairly early. Breakfast was included for our HHonors and served at the same restaurant - a lot to choose from! The rooms were big, clean, and modernly decorated. A++++ Will be back!"
60,193,"Aug 31 2008 	Great place for the price	This hotel is in a great location, very close to lots of sights of interest to tourists. An easy walk to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, the Loop, etc. There is a Jewel supermarket directly across the street as well, so no need to spend a fortune on the morning buffet. A clean hotel with attentive staff.Downsides: parking is not cheap ($26 w/o in-out privileges per day, or $44 for daily valet with unlimited in-out); pool is quite small and gets crowded quickly; rooms are a little on the small side.Overall, a good place to stay to be near much of what Chicago has to offer."
61,193,"Aug 25 2008 	Some positives some negatives	Positives:-- really good AAA rate for downtown-- excellent location, right next to red line train and close to restaurants, bars, N. Michigan Ave.-- very friendly, helpful staff-- nice rooms with comfortable bedsNegatives;-- be careful with reservations, our rate did not have a guarantee on # beds or rooms. Desk said only king beds initially but fortunately was able to get 2 beds-- Some floors have both smoking and non-smoking rooms. Hallway smelled like smoke.-- Elevators were backed up at times-- Lobby, elevators and hallways were warm and humid-- Internet connections never worked"
62,193,"Aug 24 2008 	Great Location - Very Nice Hotel	Very nice location, staff was very helpful, rooms were very clean. Has a pool which is a big plus. Would definately stay again."
63,193,"Aug 20 2008 	Great location nice comfortable hotel	I spent 4 days in Chicago on my own after running a Conference with work in Austin, Texas. I've heard a lot of people say 'oh there's nothing to do in Chicago!' but it's a fantastic city to visit! I preferred it to New York. There's amazing architecture in all the high rise buildings, great shopping, parks, the Navy Pier, beaches, there's a great boat ride round the Lake ...what more could you ask for. Also as I travelled alone I found it pretty safe, the tourist bus is the best way to get about.I chose the Hilton as it was a pretty good hotel rate for downtown Chicago and very central. I wanted a nice, safe hotel as I was alone and had never been to Chicago before. The hotel was in a perfect location, lots of restaurants close by and cheap places to eat - McDonalds is down the street! It's only a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and the beach and Magnificient Mile is just a short 5 miniute walk away. Lincoln Park zoo is a approx 50 minute walk.The hotel rooms were fantastic, really big and comfortable luxury beds - just perfect. I never ate at the hotel so can't comment on that. The only downside is that the hotel staff were very rude, every time I asked them how to get somewhere they would snap back 'get a cab' which was not very helpful as a tourist! I didn't let it spoil my trip though!I would recommend this hotel and 4 days is long enough to spend in Chicago and enjoy the city.have fun!"
64,193,"Aug 18 2008 	nice hotelgreat location	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton this last weekend and it was great! The hotel staff was very helpful and they give you a validation code for your parking which saves you like $10 a day! The room was very nice and clean. We stayed on the 20th floor and had great views. The location was great-we were in walking distance from shopping, millenium park and the rriver. We did take the free trolley to Navy Pier, and the bus to Lincoln Park. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant (Weber Grill) but it was always busy. We would have probably eaten there if we had one more day, but did snag some cheesecake from there and took it up to our room one night! Overall a great experience. We would recommend to anyone, couples or families."
65,193,"Aug 11 2008 	Bargain with a great location	Stayed here about a month ago and was very impressed. It's hard to beat this place for the price and location. The room was spacious and very clean, plus you get free wireless. The location is excellent, just a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue with plenty of shopping and great restaraunts all around. Went to the Rock Bottom Brewery across the street and the food and overall atmosphere was very good (rooftop bar is great in the summertime). They don't have a breakfast at the hotel but the staff recommended an excellent place a few blocks away (Mary's Cafe) that was definitely affordable. If you want to go to Navy Pier, the hotel staff also recommended that you could take a free trolley 2 blocks away. You also get a discount if you park in the garage attached to the hotel ($16 if I remember right). Overall, I would definitely stay here again."
66,193,"Aug 10 2008 	Great stay and perfect location	This Hilton Garden Inn was the perfect location for our trip to Chicago. We did ride the free trolley to Navy Pier, but walked to area museums, Race Street and the Magnificent Mile.Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The hotel was spotless, had a real nice gym area and pool, with a very helpful staff.Their Internet is hard wired and seemed slow, but that's the only thing I could even think about that was less than excellent.The city view from our room was a real plus.Be sure and do the fireworks at Navy Pier and if you like some nightlife, check out Redheads piano bar a few blocks away.Avoid UNO pizza!"
67,193,"Aug 6 2008 	Great hotel at a great location	Very nice hotel and a perfect location. Free internet! The internet is through an ethernet cable, but who cares if you can't carry your laptop around your room. I didn't try the complimentary breakfast, but you are in Chicago. Get out of the hotel and try some of the best food in the world.Footsteps away from the CTA red line. When you walk out of the hotel the stairs to the red line train are directly to the right. If you are familiar with riding the train in Chicago, it is perfect. If you are there to see a Cubs game, you get on the northbound red line train, and get off at the Addison stop which drops you off at the stadium.The hotel's entrance has an unloading area on Grand that is convenient for pulling into for unloading your group and luggage. An attendant will ask if you will be valet parking. Valet is $40 per day with in and out privileges. Self-parking is $26 per day after you have the parking ticket validated at the front desk. The regular price on the sign in the garage is $35 per day. The self-parking garage is connected to the hotel with entrances on both Grand and Ohio. If you are planning on parking your car and leaving it during your stay, this is the way to go. If you do self-parking, ask for the front desk to validate your ticket before you leave. When it is time to depart, you'll then insert your card into an automatic payment machine just outside the lobby to the right that you can pay with a credit card or cash.When I go back to Chicago, I am definitely going to be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn - Downtown."
68,193,"Aug 4 2008 	enjoyed the stay	The rooms were spacious and clean (looked like new). The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room had a refrigerator, coffee pot, and free internet access. It is located just 2-3 blocks from Michigan Avenue and is near a lot of restaurants and shopping. Several theatres are within a short walk (5-6 blocks). The only negative was that housekeeping did not attempt to clean our room until after 5:00 pm when we were getting ready for dinner and a show. I would stay here again."
69,193,"Jul 29 2008 	Great Hotel!	Hilton Garden Inn is a wonderful place to stay in Chicago. We stayed the week of 7/20-7/26 and it was fantastic. Our room was clean and neat throughout our stay. We got to stay on the 22nd floor, which had fantastic views. Our children enjoyed the pool several times during our stay. The staff was wonderful.One item that not too many people mention is the convenience of having a refrigerator and a microwave in our hotel room. There is a grocery store right across the street, and we were able to stock up on sodas, waters, orange juice, fruit, etc., at very reasonable prices. We even purchased cold cuts for sandwiches and had lunch in our rooms, to help save money. Every bit helps!We had an excellent stay, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the hotel itself is in a perfect location. I would recommend it to anyone."
70,193,"Jul 26 2008 	Bad Experience	This hotel seemed like a good deal, and it's location is great for sure. The room was nice enough...However, the problems began as we checked in for our one night stay. Rude staff were the norm. For instance, we had a couple of little questions and needed directions, pretty standard stuff, but the staff ignored us and when we did get their attention, seemed very put-out. And we're Hilton Honors members!There were also lots of little inconveniences: - very little sound proofing, so we heard EVERYTHING that took place in the hallway all night long.- no WiFi, just plugged-in internet (so you have to keep your laptop on the desk in the corner when in the room)- the printing services that were advertised did not work (and again, no one was available to help us use them)- we ran out of toothpaste, and found there were no complimentary toiletries if you forgot something, purchase for $5 plus only.And, at the attached restaurant, absolutely the WORST breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel. We had to leave early, so it was one of the only places open at that hour. Big mistake. Even at 6:30am, the food was cold, stale and generally bad. The omelettes, made to order, were the only good option available. And this for something like $15. I'm sure it's good for other meals, but avoid the breakfast!I'm confident you can find something better in Chicago for this price."
71,193,"Jul 23 2008 	Solid hotel with good location	Location is great, right on north side of river.. good restaurant in lobby (weber), nice clean rooms.. the &quot;gotchas&quot; -&gt; loud A/C in the rooms&gt; the internet access is ok, but kinda slow&gt; the starbucks in the lobby isn't worth it - not a full BUX, take a walk to a real one"
72,193,"Jul 20 2008 	Great stay	Great location, very clean and the staff were very friendly. The room had everything we needed and was very comfortable."
73,193,"Jul 18 2008 	very pleasant stay (even though 'L' stop was closed)	We called ahead to alert the hotel of our late check-in due to flight troubles and we had no problems when we checked in around midnight; the room we had requested was ready for us.The room was clean, included a mini-fridge, microwave, computer desk, etc. The bathroom was stocked with Neutrogena toiletries.We heard minimal traffic from our 18th floor room. We enjoyed the pantry and Starbucks found in the lobby.The front desk staff were curtious and quick with a map when we asked for directions. There were no problems checking our luggage at the front desk for a few hours after we had checked out.We did not have time to eat at the Weber Grill restaurant found within the hotel but we heard it was great.One downfall outside of the hotel's control... We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to a red line 'L' stop, but found that stop closed upon arrival. The red line next stop was about 4-5 blocks walking distance. If you're choosing the hotel based on it's proximity to the 'L', call ahead to check the status of the stop - we were told the stop has been closed often on weekends for repair.Overall, a very pleasant stay."
74,193,"Jun 25 2008	Great Location	Just got back from Chicago and wanted to write my review while everything is fresh in my mind. We arrived in the early afternoon and our room wasn't ready. Check in was at 3pm, so that was fine. They held our bags and we did some sightseeing. Returned to the hotel and our room was ready. On first entering our room which was 1711 there was a slight odor. Not bad or anything. Then when I went into the bathroom, there was a mildewy smell. I really hate that smell. But it wasn't so bad to ask for a room change. There is no fan in the bathroom and with no air circulation, the mildewy smell is going to occur. So those are some things that bugged me. The staff at the front desks changes often. Most of the staff isn't really that helpful. We asked once for a restaurant recommendation and was given the answer &quot;there are a lot of restaurants, here is a list&quot;. That isn't really what I was looking for. Then we asked directions several times and they just weren't helpful and didn't seem to care. There is one perk. Warm cookies are offered around 6:30 to 7:30 and I think again a bit later in the evening. The red line train stops right in front of the hotel so that is another plus. The location is great. Close to everything. I don't think I would stay here again, without attempting to try another hotel first. It isn't that I had a bad stay, but I think I could have had a bit of a nicer room without the smells and staff that would love to help me more."
75,193,"Jun 10 2008 	Glad I was moved here	I was originally booked at The Silversmith for my trip to Chicago for NeoCon, however because I had booked through Orbitz my room was not guaranteed and The Silversmith was oversold. They moved me to the HGI, and I'm glad they did! It was closer to the Merch Mart so I could walk there instead of taking a cab, there are many restaurants nearby including the Weber Grill attached to the hotel, the service was great and the room very comfortable. Because I arrived around 11 am, I had the choice of waiting for a regular King room or taking a King Wheelchair room right away, and I took the Wheelchair room. I don't think the room size is much different, but the bathroon is big enough for a wheelchair to spin donuts in and has a wheel-in shower with a &quot;rain&quot; style showerhead. The beds are interesting, they are like a Sleep Number bed with controls on each side to change the comfort level. A refrigerator and microwave were much appreciated, and FREE wired internet access (the first free access I have come across in Chicago!). My only complaint is that the drapes do not cover the entire window. There is a 3-4 foot space above the A/C unit that the sheers cover, but not the drapes, and the morning sun shone right on my pillow. It's a good thing Ineeded to be up early! Also there was some sort of computer issue when I checked in, and when I returned to my room the afternoon of the 2nd day my keys didn't work. When I went to the desk, I was told that I had only been booked for one night, but when I showed them my receipt from the Silversmith stating it was a two-night trip they fixed the error quickly with no hassles. All in all I enjoyed my stay here and am glad I was moved!"
76,193,"Jun 9 2008 	Just what we wanted	We were in Chicago for 4 nights just to sightsee, and we wanted to stay somewhere centrally located but less than $200/night. This hotel was perfect. Two blocks north of the river, two blocks west of the Magnificent Mile, with a subway stop right at the corner.The room was very clean, plenty big, lots of towels. The mattresses are air-filled, with a control on each side - we played with them, but couldn't tell the difference in settings. They were comfortable - we really couldn't tell that they weren't regular mattresses.Even though we were on the 15th floor there was a lot of street noise - but we live in the country, so we probably notice it more than most.The front desk staff was efficient and friendly, the valets were very nice, and they have a small area next to the front desk where you can purchase snacks and such 24 hours/day.I would definitely stay there again."
77,193,"May 26 2008 	Nice but not quiet	The hotel has a lot to like - comfy beds, a nice (if small) pool area if you have a child in tow, free broadband (wired), and friendly staff. However, it's not quiet. There is a substantial gap at the bottom of each door, so hallway conversations and door slamming will be clearly audible. The windows have good sound insulation but the AC units do not, so traffic noise and sirens pour in at all hours.I liked it well enough, but the noise coming in was loud enough that it kept my three year old from getting to sleep. I understand it's a hotel in the middle of the city, but that's too loud."
78,193,"Apr 7 2008 	Great Location and positive experience	My boyfriend used some Hilton Rewards points to book two nights here. We had a lovely stay. I love the location (close to many restaurants, shopping, and night life). Our room was very comfortable and quiet. We may not have had immediate neighbors because we didn't hear any of the other guests. The bathroom and tolietries were nice and the bed was comfortable. We had coupons for the complimentary buffet (might have been because my boyfriend has a high status in Hilton Reward Points) and it was very filling. I would defininately stay here again and would recommend it to others."
79,193,"Mar 27 2008 	Good Value	I spent five nights at the Hilton Garden having read the reviews on tripadivsor. My room was clean, quiet, with a comfortable bed-- all at a really good rate. However, this is not a high service hotel which is just fine based on the rate and convenient location. My biggest complaint was the total absence of door help when I arrived from a very long 9 hour flights with 3 bags I had to navigate through two door with no help. There were 3 front desk people watching me, a 60 year old woman, struggling with this process, but no help came to my aid. However, my check-in clerk did thoughtfully put me in a higher floor room so it would be quiet. The room they were going to put me in was on the 1st floor where I could enjoy the roadwork being done right outside. Housekeeping was a little goofy. I never had the same towel count twice but it was just me so it was not a problem. The creamers they leave for your coffee were also often not left, but the front desk always sent up some when I called.My room was quiet as long as no one was in the hall making noise. There was a half inch space between the door and threshold to my room so hall noise came right in. A family group staying in multiple rooms around me were really loud but I could not hear them once they got into their rooms.I was most pleased with the comfortable bed and having a frig with microwave. Overall a good value for the rate. But if they raised the rate, I would choose a higher service hotel as a single travelers."
80,193,"Mar 19 2008 	Excellent!	For a reasonably priced hotel in downtown Chicago, this place is hard to beat. The rooms are smallish, but clean and recently updated. The bed in my room was extremely comfortable, there was a fridge and microwave, a great office chair, and a well designed bathroom. The staff were universally excellent, especially the valet parking guys, who deserve special praise for being friendly, quick and efficient.One quibble: no Wi-Fi in the rooms, just an Ethernet connection with a cable that doesn't very far past the desk. On the positive side, there's a 24-hour business centre that allows guests to print documents either on site or from their rooms. Also, the heater is pretty noisy, so if you tend to be cold at night and are also sensitive to white noise, this may not be the place for you.Breakfast at Weber's downstairs is an extortionate $15, and Mary's Diner down the street serves bland and greasy food. There's a Starbucks in the lobby that's open only in the morning, another around the corner that's open all day long, and a local chain called Cos a block east, which serves breakfast bagels, etc. Not a gourmet experience, but definitely edible. Otherwise the location is fantastic -- within walking distance of all the attractions of the Magnificent Mile, easy access to the El, etc.I'd definitely stay here again."
81,193,"Feb 29 2008 	almost perfect	Very nice location just a couple of blocks off North Michigan Ave. shopping area. Super comfortable beds and VERY CLEAN room. Included microwave &amp; frig. We really liked the hot tub and the pool was comfortable temperature for this time of year. (actually warm enough to swim in). Staff was friendly and helpful. The only things wrong were quite minor. Such as heater blower could have been a bit quieter and bathtub was a bit slow to drain. Would definately recommend it for anyone wanting a clean,comfortable, well located, and resonably priced hotel."
82,193,"Feb 29 2008 	Just one night!	I stayed in this hotel for one night and I would definitely recommend it. Not only were the rooms spacious and very comfortable but the location is excellent.The staff were fantastic, very helpful to a couple of weary travelers! My only quibbles were that I had an ajoining room where the folks through the connecting door were loud, very loud at 2am in the morning and you could hear everything between the doors. It also took me awhile to figure out how to use the bath and shower but I figured it out.I would recommend the hotel, if you're going there though check out Mary's for breakfast ~ head out the front door and go left 4 blocks and it's there."
83,193,Feb 20 2008 	Very clean and spacious excellent location	Booked this hotel through priceline for a quick business trip. Very clean and quiet; very well appointed and spacious rooms and excellent location. Business center and indoor pool were added bonuses. Would definitely stay here again.
84,193,"Feb 16 2008	Highly recommend it	I stayed at this hotel alone for one night and was not disappointed. I chose the hotel based on the good rate I found rather than location, which was not a factor for me. My room, 2119, was very clean and aesthetically pleasant. The bathroom was clean with Neutrogena products provided. There was a microwave and small fridge. The bed was wonderful, very fluffy pillows. I did not want to crawl out after a great night's sleep. I did take note of how quiet it was. I'm used to hearing people in the hallways or next door regardless of the type of hotel I stay in but this was not the case here.I would stay here again."
85,193,Jan 28 2008 	Great hotel - Great Location	My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in January 2008. The hotel was a in a great central location close to all of the local tranport. The hotel has recently been refurbished and the rooms are lovely and bright. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Chicago area.
86,193,"Jan 27 2008 	Couldn't have wished for better accomodation and location	We booked this hotel after reading other reviews on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. This hotel is definitely more than a three star in our eyes. Checking in was painless and we were able to check in early with no problem. The staff were friendly and helpful.The room was lovely, beds extremely comfortable. The room was very clean and tidy. The housekeeping did an exceptional job everyday we stayed there.The location was excellant also, very easy to walk to the Magnificent Mile and into the city. The hop on and off bus stop was not that far away either.Overall it was the best accomodation for value for money we have stayed in."
87,193,"Jan 12 2008 	Good base of operations	I'll preface by saying the hotel is being renovated and should be complete in March; we stayed on an &quot;old&quot; floor, so take some things in stride. We went for a weekend shopping trip and booked a room because of a decent price and good location. The check-in and all interactions with the staff was excellent. They were friendly, professional, informative, helpful and always pleasant.  The room seemed small at first because of the dark colors, but is really adequate with a small kitchenette &amp; nice work area. The work station had a nice-sized desk, comfortable office chair and was well lit. I don't hear well, so if I note it, it is definitely loud. The old heat/cooling unit was rather loud (and annoying). The sirens from below bothered my wife (we were on the 14th floor). It wasn't a busy weekend, but we both heard everything in the hallway. The bed was comfortable for me, too soft for my wife. The bathroom was clean, and the rest of the room seemed okay, but had some suspicious deficiencies, such as stains on the chair, drapery, wall and ceiling (don't ask me!). The TV hutch was very dusty on top (we were going to store some purchases out of the way there...we decided against it). The carpet probably could have used a good cleaning. I'm not sure how much they've been delaying maintenance because of the renovation, so some issues might be rectified by. (To be fair, I did not contact the management about the situation). Room service is from either the Weber Grill (on the ground floor) or from Buca de Beppo (on block east). We had ribs at the Weber Grill (they were good) but that's another story. Given the service, price and location, and assuming that the renovations reduce the noise and cleanliness issues, we would recommend this property as a good base for your time in downtown Chicago."
88,193,"Jan 10 2008 	Great Every Time!	Great hotel, very clean and smart, very friendly and helpful staff, good food, free internet, great location, not too big nor small...just great really! Stay here all the time when in Chicago!"
89,193,Jan 4 2008	Poor Customer Service from Maid to Manager	Not a place to stay for the customer service or the price. I hope this keeps at least one person or more from staying here. Maid service will knock on your door at 7:30 regardless of Do not distrub sign. I stay mostly at Hilton properties (Hilton Honors Gold Member) and this has been the worst. I called the front desk to have the maid comeback and she continued to try to get into the room until I opened the door and said go away. When I checked out they were no apologies or resolution. I was told that they were busy and wanted to have the room ready for the next guest. Checkout time was 11 and I was not able to check into the room until after 4pm when I arrived 3 days earlier. It was a total lack of respect that was undeserved. Hotel Management was no help and did not speak very good english. They would not return calls and I registered a complaint with the Honors line. Even the Hampton Inn has a policy of 100% satisfaction. This does not extend to the Hilton Garden. I work for a major Vendor and attend the RSNA every year. I will not stay there again and have instructed my travel agent who books room in June for this conference not to place anyone there if at all possible. Gold Hilton Honors Member.
90,193,"Jan 2 2008 	Great location and value	The Hilton Garden Inn Downtown/Magnificent Mile provides good accommodations, great location, and a reasonable price. Located at State/Grand, the hotel: is a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile shopping area, has a subway station (Grand, on Red Line) right at its door, and has numerous restaurants in walking distance. Rooms are not lavish or large, but are clean and decent, provide a mini-fridge, mini-microwave and coffee maker. Small business center has 3 computers with free Internet access (used by a couple of teenaged girls surfing MySpace when I was there). There is a small pool and tiny fitness room. Weber Grill restaurant is a decent chain-type bar/restaurant for steaks/ribs/burgers."
91,193,"Jan 1 2008	A great hotel	This hotel was great, especially for the price and location. I was expecting a dump becasue it was so cheap and I don't like to read many reviews before staying somewhere because I tend to remember other people's comments. We paid around $100/night for the weekend before X-mas, which was a great deal. The room was clean, the beds were very comfortable and I enjoyed the free wireless internet and in-room fridge. The rooms were on the medium side, but who goes to Chicago to sit in their room? The front desk staff were VERY nice and offered us a free shopping map that was very helpful. We parked in the hotel ramp and paid $22/night to park. This is CHEAP by Chicago standards!! I paid $40/night to park a block away last year. The location is GREAT and is very close to the Mag mile. There's also ESPN zone across the street, a close McDonalds and a new Subway practically kitty-korner to the hotel. We went at lunch and it was empty becasue they are new and it's kind of off the beaten path.  Weber Grill is in the lobby-area and you can smell grilled food in the hotels hallways, even 22 floors up, but the rooms DO NOT smell. We heard a lot of people in the halls, but no one in the next room. Also, Chicago is a loud city and you'll hear sirens all night, but this has happened at every hotel I've stayed in Chicago. The pool area is small, but if you just want to relax for a while, it'll work.  I would definatley stay in this hotel again. You can look, but you will not find another quality hotel this close to the Mag Mile for this price. I'm pretty picky about nice hotels and this one passed by standards."
92,193,"Dec 30 2007	very convenient great value	I would return here for a clean, safe, comfortable place in an ideal central location for touring, with great service at the front desk. We stayed at the Peninsula a few years ago and that is a knock-your-socks-off world class luxury hotel. This is not -- it's a nice business class Hilton family property. But I would actually prefer to return to this one, instead of the Peninsula, because it is more centrally located, and I don't need to pay for all that luxury when we are out touring all day. We like to walk, and we were able to walk to the boat tours, the old Marshall Field in the Loop, Berghoff, the Sears Tower, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and the Hancock building, all from the HGI. The Peninsula was a little bit further north, less convenient to the Loop, and so we found ourselves using many more cabs. We had a great lunch at Berghoff (weekday lunches on the main floor are as good as ever, including the homemade root beer) and we also had a lot of fun at dinner and great traditional food in a German neighborhood place to the north, the Chicago Brauhaus in Lincoln Square."
93,193,Dec 19 2007 	I can see clearly	I was in Chicago to have lasik surgery and the lasik center recommended this hotel because it was close and they give a discount for people going to the center. We got there before check in because of my appointment time and the front desk was great. The room was not ready but said that they would keep our bags and take them to the room when it was ready. The woman working at the desk and the gentleman that helped with the bags were so nice. They both ask how I was doing when I got back from the center and also told us about the restaraunts in the area. It was a great stay!!
94,193,"Dec 16 2007 	Disappointed......	This hotel has so many good reviews that we decided to book it for our two week stay in Chicago. 2 years ago, we stayed in the Palmer House Hilton so thought we'd try its little sister!We're now in the second week of our stay and I must say, I'm really disappointed in the hotel. Don't get me wrong, the hotel itself is ideally placed with the red line El (Grand) right outside the door and the Mag Mile within walking distance. Also, the staff are friendly and the room bigger than expected, clean and tidy.Our main issue is noise. From everywhere. We're on the 13th floor and can hear absolutely everything either of our neighbours does, especially when in the bathroom which is embarrassing for both parties! You can hear word for word everything your neighbour says if you're in the bathroom whilst they're talking in their own room. At nightime, you can hear the toilets flushing on either side and if someone decides to have a late night/early morning bath or shower then believe me, you'll know about it!Also, even with the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign positioned on your door, you'll be sure to hear the maids as they go about their daily duties, shouting out to each other from the other end of the corridor. We've also had other guests stand outside our door and have animated conversations on their mobiles, or with other guests in the middle of the night. The air conditioning unit is another story altogether and for the first few nights, ours was coming every ten minutes then going off again. We reported this and were advised an engineer would look at it but haven't heard anything since. We've came up with our own way of making sure the outburts are now shorter so our sleep isn't disturbed too much during the night.We considered asking for a room move but reckon all the rooms must be the same, we've came to the conclusion that the walls are made of tissue paper.All in all, the hotel is certainly a nice place, and has the bonus of having three pc's in the business centre which you can access free internet but please, if you're coming here for peace and quiet then I'd choose another hotel."
95,193,"Dec 9 2007 	We loved the Hilton Garden Inn	We booked our hotel in early November for a one night stay in early December. We used expedia and got a rate of $99 plus tax. The great thing is that parking is only $22 a night if you self park with no in/out privelages. The parking garage is attached to the hotel so it is convenient. We had a room with a king bed, microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer and more. The room felt exceptionally clean. The bed was a therapeutic. The comforter was white and soft and you could tell it is kept clean. It felt like home, not the tacky, old multi-colored comforters/bedspreads many hotels use. The view was good. The staff was nice and helpful. There is a pool and jacuzzi tub on the 12 floor along with a business center. The pool is a bit small but very clean and the jacuzzi was wonderful. The hotel is in a great location with easy walking to the magnificant mile on Michiagn Ave and much more. There is a mini-starbucks store right in the lobby. The restaurant P.F. Changs is attached to the hotel along with a grill with a nice bar. I would go back to this hotel again, even if I didn't get the same great rate. It is tough to get that low of a parking rate at most hotels."
96,193,"Nov 11 2007 	Very Good Stay	I attended a convention the week of Nov. 6th. Before I made my reservation, I tried to obtain a room at one of the more exclusive hotels, but they were sold out due to several conventions scheduled that week. The Hilton Garden Inn was a very pleasant surprise. My room offered a good view of the cityline, good size and comfortable linens. I am very picky about my sleeping quarters, and this was very suitable and very clean. The bathroom was adequate. The service and staff was great! This was my first trip to Chicago and I wanted to experience the luxury's that Chicago offers. The hotel is in a great location and the Weber Grill located in the hotel had good steaks. Also, on the corner, I dined at PF Changs, which is always very good. Make sure you visit the Hancock Observatory and dine on the upper level for lunch, make sure you visit the restroom for the view. Also, you can't miss the Navy Pier. My favorite, of course, was the shopping on the Magnificent Mile! What an experience. Needless to say, I came with luggage weighing 24lbs and left with 46lbs and two carry on shopping bags."
97,193,"Oct 14 2007 	No luxury hotel - but good value for money	I stayed in this hotel for leisure for five days and was overall quite satisfied with my experience. The big advantage of this hotel is its location - it is very conveniently located in the near north area just two blocks away from MagMile and a few more from the Loop. It is also one of the more inexpensive hotels in this area and offers spotlessly clean rooms, free high-speed Internet access and comfortable beds. The service we received was efficient and faultless. Additionally, I found the hotel much more quiet than I expected from reading some of the reviews on Tripadvisor. All in all, I found it was a good base for exploring Chicago.What are the downsides? The rooms as well as the lobby are a bit on the small side by US-standards. The lobby and the adjacent Weber Grill Restaurant can become pretty crowded at times, especially during breakfast and dinner &quot;rush hours&quot;. The Starbucks in the lobby has very limited opening hours (actually it was closed most of the time when I fancied a hot drink) which is not a big problem as there are various grocery stores and cafes around the hotel. All in all, it is not really a luxurious place to stay but rather a hotel that offers above-average standard at reasonable prices.Would I stay there again? On a similar occasion, yes."
98,193,"Oct 2 2007	very ordinary	The hotel is in a great location, however the rooms and amenities are below expectations. The night I stayed their website price was $405 a night - I pricelined for about $90. The latter price was more than enough. The rooms are small. The staff are way less than three star. Take it from a seasoned traveler.... ok, but don't pay a lot for this."
99,193,"Sep 27 2007 	Very good hotel	very good hotel, ideally situated. everything is within walking distance. very clean. friendly staff. it has a pool with a small jacuzzi, a business center and high speed internet in the room. the best thing about this hotel is that it's a very quiet hotel although it is located in downtown.Sita &amp; Gieta"
100,193,"Sep 14 2007 	Great location small pool	Stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago. Staff were all really friendly and helpful. Room was pleasant as you would expect. The hotel location is great (walking distance) for the Magnificent Mile (shopping) and The Loop. There are plenty of bars/restaurants in the area, including the Weber Grill attached to the hotel. There is a pool &amp; jacuzzi, however no sauna or steam room, and the pool is very small indeed! There is free internet access in the rooms, or in the business centre if you haven't brought your laptop!"
101,193,"Sep 14 2007 	Friendly staff lovely room fantastic location	I booked a room for myself and a friend through Hotwire and got a good deal on the room. At check-in the staff were friendly and helpful and the desk staff always had a friendly smile and greeting whenever we passed through reception regardless of what time of the day or night it was. The room had two queen-sized beds and we experienced no problems with house keeping, the bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean every day. We had breakfast in the Weber Grill attached to the hotel on the first day and it was the only low point of the stay. The breakfast was cold (this was at 10am and breakfast sevice ended at 10.30 am) and expensive but the waiting staff were very nice and on another visit (this time for lunch) the food was very good. Most of the other guests were also quite young and there seemed to be a few bachelorette parties staying but even so it didn't seem too noisy. Overall, a fantastic hotel with an unbeatable location."
102,193,"Aug 27 2007 	Fast response from House Keeping	We were stuck at Chicago O'Hare on lay over as the airport shut down due to weather. We were very happy to be able to snag a room for the night, our rate was about $210. Since we arrived without our bags, at check in I asked for a basic toiletry kit. They said they would call housekeeping. Nada. I call housekeeping, they quickly brought toothpaste and brush for one, we needed 2, plus do they have a bathrobe? Another quick response and we had what we requested. I expected the hotel could provide an actual kit, with shaver, deodorant, comb, toothpaste/brush etc.Food: Call room service, no response. Try again, busy signal. Again, no response. Call front desk, they tried, no response. &quot;must be busy, try again later&quot;. We keep trying and finally after about 15 minutes we are connected with room service. Room delivery was speedy and the pizza was good along with the Mrs. Parks house cabernet.Bathroom: The shower curtain needed changing as it smelled moldy. As I showered, even though I was careful to get the curtain all right, I still flooded the floor. There were only 3 towels for the room and I hated to waste the &quot;spare&quot; on the floor to mop up the water. Water pressure was okay, plenty of hot water and there is a supply of soaps and lotions and shampoo.Room/bed: Nice layout with desk sitting area and then the flat panel TV. Comfy bed with a pillow top. Down comforter and pillows, soft sheets. Cozy for the weary traveler.Breakfast: No complimentary breakfast. Food was good and service great.Check out: Simple. Grab an airport shuttle at the front door and back to O'Hare.It looked like a nice location, the area was very clean, a nice area of the city. Obviously we didn't spend much time there."
103,193,"Aug 26 2007 	Great experience	My family and I just spent 3 nights at the Hiton Garden Inn Chicago and had a great stay. Every staff member we had contact with from check-in to check-out was totally professional and went out of their way to be helpful. The location of this property is great for getting to shopping, dining, and the shows. Be sure to inquire about the breakfast package especially if you are traveling with children."
104,193,"Aug 15 2007 	Wish I had stayed longer	I only stayed here for one night in July but I wish it had been longer. The room was excellent with a king size bed and it was, without doubt, the comfiest bed I have ever slept in, even without using the possible adjustments. I did not want to get up in the morning! There was also the use of a fridge which is always a plus with me. It is nearby to shopping areas, including a very useful supermarket where I got an international phone card. The pool is small but at 10.30 pm I had it to myself. I went to the Weber Grill for breakfast where the staff were friendly and I got the most delicious pancakes, freshly made for me. I was sorry to leave so soon."
105,193,"Aug 13 2007 	Great location nice hotel.	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend girls' get-away for some shopping and clubbing. Overall, we really liked the hotel. It was clean, the rooms were nice (albeit rather small), the beds were VERY comfortable, and we had an amazing view from our corner room. The location can't be beat. We found the staff to be curteous and helpful. I would recommend this hotel for sure. And one other perk...a Starbucks in the lobbey. :)"
106,193,"Aug 13 2007 	Great Chicago location	We picked this hotel based on the good reviews and also it's close proximity to the Magnificent Mile, boat cruise and other attractions. We were able to walk with small children to many of our destinations. Also the hotel is a short distance from one of the free trolley stops.As for the hotel itself: Check-in went very fast. Our clean room had two comfy queen beds that had tons of great pillows. We stayed on the 21st floor, so traffic noise wasn't a problem. The bathroom was a nice size and our room had a mini fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and high speed Internet access. The swimming pool was small, but it served the purpose. The hot tub was clean and the whole swimming pool area was in nice shape with lots of clean towels. Two floors of the hotel had wireless Internet access. On one side of the lobby is a Starbucks that was open in the morning hours and on the opposite side is the Weber Grill. We didn't go to either one, but the Weber Grill was packed for dinner, so they must be doing something right. The hotel has valet and self parking. The parking structure is connected to the building and has easy access to the hotel. Parking was $22.00 a day which was reasonable considering other hotels charge much more. My only complaint is that the concierge didn't know a thing about the free trolley service, so he wasn't much help to us.I'd stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again for the convenient location. At less then $200.00 a night, I thought it was a good deal for being in the heart of Chicago."
107,193,"Aug 6 2007 	Perfect choice for Chicago-trip	After reading all the tripadvisor-reviews, we decided to go for this hotel. Good choice!We 've stayed here 3 nights and everything was really good.The hotel itself is clean, nicely decorated (nothing special, but just as you would expect from a Hilton/garden inn) and the location is really perfect! Downtown, close to the nicest stores, attractions, bus stops and restaurants; great!The staff is VERY friendly, the breakfast at the Weber Grill (which was free for us, as Hilton Honors members) is really nice and everything's freshly prepared to your order. The room we had was very spacious and clean. I would really recommend this hotel."
108,193,"Aug 4 2007 	Fine--not perfect	This hotel is in a great location just off the magnificant mile. It's a garden inn--not the ritz. The room was clean and adequate, but not large and luxurious. We had a few minor problems with housekeeping (but they were responsive and took care of it immediately) and the cooling unit--hard to maintain a steady temperature--but nothing serious (or we would have rated it lower). The staff was friendly. We would happily stay there again, but also would consider other places."
109,193,Jul 29 2007 	Noisy room	This hotel was in a great location but staff were very impersonal .While we were checking in the clerk kept answering the phone.The room was fairly spacious but the A/C was very noisy. We turned it off to discover we could hear other rooms aircon. All we wanted was a quiet room. I would not stay at this hotel again.
110,193,"Jul 17 2007 	Girls Weekend at the Hilton	I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn the weekend of July 15th. As other reviewers have noted, this hotel is in a great location. It seemed we were able to walk everywhere.As Hilton Honors members, we received free breakfast buffet coupons at the Weber Grill (connected to the hotel). Good buffet - nothing fancy - but a great way to start the day with made to order omelettes, pancakes, potatoes, french toast, bacon, sausage, pastries, etc.The hotel is definitely understaffed. There always seemed to be a line at the front desk regardless of the time of day. I needed to call on three separate occasions for a wake up call and was put on hold for over 5 minutes each time.The rooms are nothing fancy and seemed a bit small, but were clean and had comfortable beds.I have stayed at this hotel before and would stay again."
111,193,"Jun 28 2007 	Big Hotel well positioned small rooms	In Chicago for a conference. Stayed at the Hilton for its location which was great. Good facilities, good health suite/indoor pool. Food and service very good. Rooms clean, well maintained although rather small."
112,193,"Jun 18 2007	Great for Young Teenagers	Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn downtown in mid-May with a group of 17 (8th grade trip of 10 students + 7 parents). We had a great time! The location can't be beat, as it was easy walking distance to many restaurants, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, etc. We used plenty of public transportation (trolley, city bus, subway, &quot;el&quot;) which were very easy to access. The staff was extremely helpful with transportation questions. The kids loved the small pool (which is to be expected in downtown Chicago). We purchased breakfast foods/snacks at the Jewel Osco across the street and stocked the in-room refrigerators. Rooms were just the right size, and the elevators were quick.Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
113,193,"May 29 2007 	Great location and clean rooms	I recently stayed in this Hotel again, I again got a clean room that was not that noisy, because it was on the 20th floor. The bed was great to sleep in and they had free high spped internet.Thx to my HH status, I got invited to breakfast - which was served at the hotel restaurant, called Weber Grill. It was a good buffet with great bacon and lovely pancakes.The location of the hotel can not be beaten: it is a 3 minute walk from North Michigan Ave, right next to a CTA subway station and close to many bars and pubs.It is not a luxery hotel, but great for what you pay for!"
114,193,"May 28 2007 	Enjoyed the Hilton Garden Inn	I stayed in Late April Early May for a Seminar and this hotel was just fine. The room was sufficient and was less money then the Seminar sponsored hotels and it is only three blocks from Michigan Avenue and all the action. There is a subway/metro entrance directly in front of the property if you need public transport, but not to be confused with EL or the Elevated Train, which could be loud in the evening. Great Stay and Drama Free.."
115,193,"May 8 2007 	What you need to know	Getting to this hotel from O'Hare by public transport is very easy but may not be ideal if you have a lot of luggage or a few kids. Hop on the blue line, switch at Jackson to the red line, get off at Grand and the hotel is at the top of the stairs, cost $2!! The journey takes about an hour. The red line also takes you to Wicked, get off at Randolph and Washington. We always found a queue at reception, the staff continuously stopped dealing with customers to answer the phone, maybe a telephonist would solve the Q problem. The room was a little gloomy but clean, the air con was one of those huge old boxes and was very very loud, nothing subtle about it at all. The traffic noise was considerable but in a downtown hotel that is to be expected. However this faded into insignifcance when compared with the constant mysterious droaning noise, the sort of noise that hurts your whole body and not just your ears. We hoped it would go but it didn't, we tracked it down to pipes lurking behind a door on the opposite side of the corridor, I asked for a different room. The hotel was fully booked and it would be midnight before the staff knew of cancellations, the receptionist promised to call before she went off duty to let us know if we could move, she didn't call, she promised to get us earplugs, they didn't arrive, she promised to leave a message for the next shift, someone was to call us at 7.30am, she didn't appear to leave the message and they didn't call. Finally after explaing the whole story again the following morning we were moved, a lower room, worse traffic noise but that was ok.............until the dripping started. I awoke in the early hours to hear water dripping onto the ceiling above the bed, it was very annoying, I left a note and a generous tip for housekeeping and asked that they report this problem. I returned from my day out to find it had not been resolved, the guy on reception said he would deal with it immediatley, I returned after Wicked went to bed and woke in the early hours with drip drip drip....So 3 sleepless nights in the Hilton Garden Inn.On the plus side, breakfast in the Weber Grill was good, very attentive staff and eggs, pancakes and omlettes made to order. Cosmopolitans at the bar were great.Out and about, exit front door and turn right, walk along a few blocks and you will come across a good Irish Bar, Fado. On this same street you will find a Rain Forest Cafe, a Hard Rock Cafe and the anniversary McDonalds, the poshest Mickey D's you will ever see and the only one I have ever been in where the food in real life is as good as the photographs. You will also find a stop for the Hop On Hop Off tour which was very good value but it's the luck of the draw when it comes to guides. We had Baron &quot;the sexiest tour guide on the planet even if he did say so himself&quot; he was interesting and funny, the next guy wasn't so hot. Good stops are the Navy Pier, a little quiet during our visit, the art museum which had more Monets than you could shake a stick at, the aquarium, fab penguins and of course Sears Tower, well organised and no real queues.We saw Wicked which was good but not great, Elphaba has a tremendous voice but lacked a bit of stage presence, Glinda saved the show. I should add that we watched Mary Poppins on Broadway the previous week, it was totally fabulous and perhaps this jaded our view of Wicked just a little bit. As noted in the prvious reviews, the Mag Mile and Nordstroms are a few steps away. Chicago is a beautiful city, for folk in Ireland, Aer Lingus do direct flights from Dublin, pop over for a few days, you won't regret it.Would I stay here again? Yes, if they could guarantee a good nights sleep. The location is superb and its good value for money"
116,193,"May 8 2007 	Great Location Decent Property	The best feature of this property is the location. It is only a few blocks off Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. A rail rapid transit station entrance (Grand Street Station on the Red Line subway) is right outside the door, which is convenient, especially if you are going to a baseball game as this line serves both U.S. Cellular Field (White Sox) and Wrigley Field (Cubs). The property itself is fine, but nothing special. It is a standard Hilton Garden Inn, which microwaves and refrigerators in each room. The rooms are smaller than the usual Hilton Garden Inn and also not as well furnished as most Hilton Garden Inns, but are very clean, if not quite spotless. Includes a fairly nice business center and small fitness room, with a small, but nice pool. As a bonus, hotel guests have complimentary access to a large, full service gym one block away. Instead of the usual, non-descript restaurant that is normally included in Hilton Garden Inns, the Weber Grill restaurant is on the first floor. The food here is extremely good and it includes a lively bar. Breakfast includes a reasonably priced buffet with numerous choices including outstanding bacon and pancakes. The only complaint is that the hotel feels crowded, as if the designers never thought it would sell out. The lobby is small and there are not really enough elevators to properly handle a full house, which is what I encountered the weekend I was there. Most significantly, the front desk was inadequately staffed, resulting in long lines. The staff themselves were very helpful and efficient; there simply were not enough of them to handle the volume of guests. Of course, Hilton Garden Inn is not a full service hotel brand, so a portion of this problem may be attributed to that fact. BOTTOM LINE: A good choice if it is price competitive."
117,193,Apr 25 2007 	Perfect Location	I was in town for the Paddy's day celebrations and the hotel is great for visiting the countless pubs &amp; clubs of this great city. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were really nice and the Weber grill downstairs is great for food at any time of the day. All in all very good value for money !
118,193,"Apr 17 2007 	Great location!	I recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Chicago. This was my second stay there and I will continue to go back. The location can't be beat. The Red Line Grand el station sits on the property. It is one block from Michigan Ave located on the backside of Nordstroms. There are endless bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel. The Weber Grill bar is a great place to grab a drink and appetizer. Also, if you want a terrific breakfast, go to Snickers on the corner just a block north of restaurant/brewery across the street. Great little place....not fancy, great hashbrowns and eggs for a low price."
119,193,"Apr 15 2007	Great location	We stayed at the HGI on 4/6 and 4/7. It is very conveniently located to bus, train and trolley. The buses run one block over on Michigan Ave.There is a grocery store across the street. where you can buy a bus/train pass for $5.00 for 1 day. The hotel was very nice, clean. The beds were comfortable. The room had a microwave, mini fridge and internet connection. I called the hotel to make reservations because we wanted adjoining rooms. I didn't see any place on their website to make that request when booking two rooms. They said that they couldn't guarantee adjoining rooms. I called the morning of 4/6 and asked if they would be available. We were able to get two adjoining rooms with king size beds. We were happy! It helps to be flexible. I would recommend this hotel to everyone."
120,193,"Apr 13 2007 	Fine but not the best	Have stayed here on several occasions before, and I have to say that this time round I was a little disappointed - nothing particular, but on previous stays I'd been put in rooms on the higher floors of the hotel and I remember them as more spacious and comfortable than the room I was given this time, on the 16th floor. Terrible soundproofing (which wasn't a problem last time I stayed) meant that I could hear everything from both rooms next door - the TV, people in the bathroom, etc etc. Also the room was a bit more 'tired' and less spacious than I remember. However couldn't complain too much - the price was good, it was perfectly clean and staff are helpful and friendly - it's efficient and in a great location. I just think that there might be better deals out there if you look around - however would be happy to stay here again."
121,193,"Mar 29 2007 	Buyer Beware	On March 27th, I booked a 3 night stay in May at this property for$180.00 per night. I quickly realized that I had made a mistakeand the next day tried to add an additional day. On the internetat Hiltons website they allowed me to add an additional dayat $229.00 for each day of my stay. Most hotel companies willsay &quot;we're delighted that you've decided to stay an extra day with us,Hilton says &quot;this is our opportunity to rape you&quot;. I was upset enough that I canceled the entire reservation. Today, March 29thwe called this lovely property and were politely told there wasnothing they could do for us. Mind you, we have been HiltonHonor members since Julyt 1995.. I would be willing to take betson how many times you think I will stay at a Hilton property forthe rest of my life. There are too many hotel companies that really do care about their customers."
122,193,"Mar 27 2007 	great!	great hotel in the heart of the city, close to everything. excellent amenities (pool, jacuzzi, computer use etc) and good service. only drawback: the room decor is too 'flowery' (although beds are comfortable and bathroom well equipped)."
123,193,"Mar 24 2007 	very nice	We had two rooms for our family of six and while they were not connecting, we had no issues. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quite. The location was great with tons of things within walking distance. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
124,193,"Mar 16 2007 	NIce clean Hotel- great Location	Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn March 13-16, 2007. The hotel is in a great location, with Nordstroms 1 block over and Michigan Ave. 2 blocks. The Navy Pier is straight down Grand Ave. and a nice walk if the weather is nice- probably about 10 blocks. We got up and ran along Lake Michigan one morning. We were on the 21st floor at the Hotel. It was very quiet from street noise, however the doors slamming automatically in the halls are loud and annoying. The room has a small microwave, fridge, and are large. The beds are comfortable and firm. NOt the best I have slept on, but adequate. We used the small fitness room which had 2 really good ellipticals, and 3 lower quality treadmills. I also used the business center, which is free to surf the web and print out my airline boarding passes. We got a buy 2 nights get third night free special, which made the hotel very reasonable. The red line sub way is right outside the door and you can get to Lincoln Park area and Shopping on State very easy. A great seafood restaurant- Shaw's is down a block. Highly recommended! Buy your discount theater tickets on[----].overall, I would stay there again. The rooms were very clean and the staff was great! Did not eat at the Wevber Grill."
125,193,"Mar 12 2007 	Good Hotel	I stayed at HGI on 3/9 &amp; 3/10. Booked through Travelzoo for a great rate of $89.00 per night. It was very busy with basketball playoffs...not why I was there...so was glad I had booked far in advance. Great location, just a couple of blocks off Michigan Ave. Nice rooms, bathrooms etc. Would definately stay there again. Weber Grill restaurant that is attached is very nice. Try the artichoke dip appetizer and you will be very happy. Steaks are great too! Self park and get validated at the front deak when leaving saves you some money."
126,193,"Mar 6 2007 	Great location	This hotel has a great location as others have stated. We used public transportation- the red line was at the door, and the bus a short walk away. We received a corner room xx32 on a high floor. We had two windows and a great view. The fitness room is nice, the pool is tiny- but I had it to myself at 6:30 am."
127,193,"Feb 27 2007 	Worked for us	My husband and I booked this last minute and went with the HGI based on price and location. It couldn't have been better for us. There is a red line stop just outside the front door, so it was very convienent to everything from the loop to the water tower and beyond.My only complaint was that they wanted $2 for a granola bar in the gift shop. Insanity. There is a Jewel/Osco grocery around the corner and a Trader Joes nearby, so I stocked up the fridge in our room with juice and snacks (I'm pregnant and must eat constantly).I know there is a pool and workout room but we didn't use it. I think this would be a great hotel for a family."
128,193,"Feb 26 2007 	HGI rocks ! Excellent stay 	Excellent mid-level hotel at a very convenient location, and at a very good price for Chicago. Front desk service = Jessica and Diane, were superb! Super nice welcome and very helpful and efficient, handling all requests perfectly. Room was on 20th floor with nice view North of Hancock Tower, and was absolutely quiet, spotlessly clean, and comfortable. The nice amenities included complimentary high-speed in-room internet access, fridge, microwave (perfect for families), good-sized desk, lounge chair w/ottomon, Neutrogena bath products, as well as small pool &amp; hot tub and gym/exercise room. This hotel also offered a &quot;Business center&quot; with (3) computers, printers, and supplies of everything to do business, along with conference rooms on 12th floor...for all guests. The hotel is 2.5 short blocks from famous shopping at Michigan Avenue, and has the &quot;Weber Grill&quot; restaurant attached. We did not try the restaurant, but it seemed perfect for meat lovers... priced like a steakhouse too! Plenty of restaurants, clubs, bars in the area as well. Red Line subway station conveniently right outside front door.Only very minor minus: when the heat/AC unit turns on (like other HGI we've stayed at) seems noisy/loud at first, but got used to it. No problem sleeping.Yes, we'd stay here again .. without hesitation."
129,193,"Feb 20 2007 	Loved the HGI	Booked 3 rooms at the HGI this past weekend thru Travelzoo for 89$ back in November. It was a mom and kid's weekend and the hotel couldn't have been any nicer. We had requested an early check in which they accomodated and set us up in a corner of the 22nd floor all together.They rooms are fairly laarge with a microwave and fridge and Neutrogena products. Everyone at the desk was helpful for directions, transportation. The location was EXCELLENT. We walked everywhere and the Red line was right outside. The Navy Pier Trolley right up the street.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.Only drawbacks.....the hot tub was not filled the entire time we were theree and after a cold day would have been appreciated. Secondly, I would Not recommend the Webber Grill for breakfast...long lines at the buffet."
130,193,"Feb 3 2007 	Veru nice great location..	We found the Hilton Garden Inn to be very clean, fresh and updated, and the location cannot be beat. We got a great rate through the Hilton web site for $129 a night with our third night free. No breakfast is served but we did have a microwave and mini-frigerator. There is a restaurant located off the lobby, mainly barbque, but room service is offered, and numerous restaurants are within a block. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The indoor pool is nice but small. Nordstroms and Northbridge Shopping Mall are a very short block away, and Michigan Avenue, aka, the Magnificent Mile, is two very short blocks from the hotel door. Parking is availible, for a fee, of course, in a garage attached to the hotel and there is a heated circular driveway from which you may load and unload your car. Bell hops and valets are readily available, but in no way is their service pushed upon you. We would definately stay in this hotel again."
131,193,"Jan 15 2007 	Excellent Stay! Great hotel	Great location for a 3 day weekend in Chicago. Staff is friendly and helpful, rooms clean and comfortable. Located 2 easy blocks from Michigan, lots of great restaurants close by, 1/2 mile walk down State to Macy's (former Marshall Fields), the Red Line is steps from the front entrance, a Jewel grocery across the street, Trader Joe's also 2 blocks away....We really found the location and accomodations to be great! The front desk has a list of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. We arrived at midnight and the front desk gave us several options for places to grab a bite at that late hour. We opted for Mother Hubbards (State and Hubbard). This sports bar definitely was a 'locals' only kind of find. Simple but good bar type food. Don't miss Volare, a really nice Italian restaurant one block east of Michigan on Grand. My recommendation is to share an appetizer (the rolled eggplant was exceptional!), pasta and meat course to get the best value and especially since servings are ample but not too large."
132,193,"Jan 13 2007 	Loved the Location!!	We stayed in this hotel for Christmas, the hotel is great, great location, staff were so helpful. The Red train line is just outside the door and it is a $5 cab ride to the nearest blue line (which we used alot) which takes you to some great shopping malls. The breakfast was great as this was included in our room price, lovely buffet. I have to say I missed my proper meals of what I like my potatoes and veg and meat, which is very hard to get, was sick of fast food by the second day. We ate in the restaurant in the hotel a few times and it was ok. I ordered room service one nite, the chicken was cold and I ended up getting food poisoning, which kind of ruined the holiday. But over all I cannot complain about the hotel and I would recommend the store across the street Jewel for stocking up on food as there is a fridge and microwave in the room."
133,193,"Jan 7 2007 	Absolutely Perfect!	What a location! We arrived, parked our car, and walked everywhere. It was such a breeze checking in, the staff was incredible, and only $93/night! We will definitely be coming back in the future."
134,193,"Jan 5 2007 	Great experience	My husband and I had go to Chicago on somewhat short notice ( to take care of a relative's estate). Since it was going to be a stressful trip, I didn't want to have to worry about the quality of the hotel. I found a reasonable price on Travelocity and booked our stay, and we weren't disappointed. We ended up extending our stay and were able to get an even better rate from the front desk than on the Hilton website.We didn't rent a car, and were able to get around easily (the metro stop is literally outside the hotel, as mentioned in another review). Having a small fridge and a microwave in the room allowed us to keep our food costs down. There's a Jewel/Osco a block away, and a Trader Joe's about two or three blocks away. Plenty of good restaurants in the area, too. The housekeeping staff took good care of our room and were friendly when we wanted to sleep in."
135,193,"Jan 2 2007 	Weekdn getaway with the kids	Had a great stay with our two kids over the week of Christmas. Price was right ($93 through Hilton website), location was great (Nordstrom's for the wife and daughter, ESPNZone for my son and me just around the corner) and the staff was efficient and friendly. There are probably a dozen restaurants withina one block radius.The exercise room wasn't huge but had three treadmills and some other machines. The pool was very small and overly-chlorinated but the kids loved it just the same.I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good price on it!"
136,193,"Jan 2 2007	Perfect Location During A Perfect Weekend	I came home last night from a two night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. I found a very good price for the New Years Eve weekend at hotels.com. (later a better price of $89.00 per night became available on travelzoo, but I couldn't cancel by original reservation) The location was perfect. We parked in the attached self park garage - nobody at the front desk mentioned anything about parking validation, but I asked at check-out. It saved $11.00 per day. Make sure you ask!The room was very clean and spacious with a great view. There is a fridge and microwave which were very nice to have for our leftover meals that turned into a midnight snack. This may seem silly to some, but the I loved the toiletries they provide. Neutrogena products. I like knowing what I am using instead of mystery brands. The Weber Grill is on the first floor and made for a great lobby bar. We ate breakfast there one morning and were disappointed to see that it was a buffet for $12.00 each. We were hoping we could order steak and eggs. That's okay. The food was good - there was an omlete bar and you could order eggs cooked to your liking if the scrambled ones were not what you wanted. I appreciated the security at the hotel on New Years Eve. After 10pm you had to provide your room key and a picture ID before getting on the elevator. There were also strict rules regarding noise levels and multiple guests in rooms. We didn't have any issues, but it was nice to know that if it were a problem, something would be done. This was a perfect location for shopping, dining, drinking and fun. I'll be back!"
137,193,"Dec 27 2006	So Convenient to Everything!	We stayed here for a Bears game and general sightseeing. With the Red line right outside the door, we were able to go everywhere we wanted very easily. The hotel is also located right across from a very nice Jewel food store. Great for sodas or snacks.Check in was a breeze and the employees very friendly. We had requested a king nonsmoking and a king smoking and both were ready for us. A nice security feature is you must use your room key to use the elevator.Our room was fairly large, especially for city standards and was spotless with very nice furniture. It also had a microwave and refridgerator along with a coffee pot. We had a view of the Hancock Building and the windows opened slightly for fresh air.It had a good size bath that was also spotless and nice toiletries including lotion and mouthwash which is not often given. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water.The beds were comfy and made up with double sheets which is a nice touch. Pillows were okay but of the foam variety and a little hard. Free internet is a nice feature but charges for local phone calls a little cheap in my opinion.The Weber Grill is located in the hotel and serves a wonderful breakfast buffet with great service.Overall a great stay and would definitely stay there again. Wonderful location just off Michigan Avenue and a nice clean, friendly atmosphere. What more could you ask for."
138,193,"Dec 18 2006 	Too Good to be True	Another great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. This was our 3rd time staying here in two years. We had adjoining rooms with my Mother, Wife and three kids. We paid $89.00 a nite. This rate was through travelzoo. The hotel is in a excellent location. The staff are the friendliest people. I have to say that about everyone we had contact with. You will find that people in Chicago in general are friendly(must be a midwest thing). We also will be returning in March."
139,193,"Nov 28 2006 	ANOTHER GREAT STAY...	This is our third stay in two years at this hotel. Terrific location and nice sized rooms. Having a microwave and small frig in the room is a definite plus, particularly w/ a wonderful market right across the street for snacks. Not really a nice view from this hotel, but it's a good value and a short walk to Michigan Avenue. My only complaint is w/ the hallway doors. They SLAM shut , and I mean SLAM! You can hear everyone coming and going because they don't think to grab the door. Would definitely stay here again though -- and probably will next Thanksgiving when we go back up to Chicago."
140,193,"Nov 13 2006 	Outstanding in every way	Five college friends and I had a delightful stay. From the exceptional customer service (front desk, housekeeping, bellmen, etc.) to the large, clean, and comfortable rooms, we found the hotel to be outstanding in every way. From the 23rd floor, the view of the city was fantastic; street-side, the location on Grand and State was great -- just steps away from lively Michigan Ave. and all it has to offer. We were especially impressed at the hotel staff's willingness and abilitiy to honor our request for adjoining rooms -- one with two beds; the other a Murphy suite with a double bed, large sitting area with sofabed, plus a kitchenette. From our previous experience at other hotels we were not optimistic about the likelihood that we'd get what we requested when we made the reservation. But by calling the night before arrival, the front desk staff and housekeeping made sure we got what we asked for. We've stayed at the 5-star Omni on previous trips and found the 3-star Hilton Garden Inn to be superior in every way. We'll be back!"
141,193,"Oct 24 2006 	Such a relief!	My Mom and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn, downtown Chicago this past August on a girls trip. We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel was very clean, the service was awesome, staff was eager to help with any questions we had, quiet rooms and comfy beds. The breakfast is the best downstairs! The pool was a little small (especially when there is 10 kids in it).Mom and I were in Chicago for the King Tut exhibit at the Field Mueseum. As the hotel is a hop skip and a jump from the Magnificent Mile, transit was super easy. We were originally booked into another hotel, but after reading it's review on this site, we switched, and we are so relieved we did.One more thing, Mom and I asked for a corkscrew from concierge. It got to our room super fast however it broke off in our bottle. Moral of the story? Don't ask the hotel for a corkscrew. They are pretty cheap."
142,193,Oct 12 2006 	Very Good Hotel	Stayed for just three nights in September this year. The hotel is in a great location for just about everything. Good sized room with an OK view and everything was clean and well maintained. Staff across the board was very helpful. Weber Grill is great for breakfast ($12.95 for buffet) and also steaks. Highly recommended hotel.
143,193,"Oct 3 2006 	We loved the location!	We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago for 4 nights last fall. Average priced (for Chicago) parking was located on site. We parked our car and walked or took public transportation everywhere we needed to go.The check-in was quick, the lobby was attractive, and the room was a nice size, very clean, and suprisingly quiet. We had a very nice view out our window. We had an adequate sized refrigerator and microwave in the room, too.Directly across the street from the hotel (to the west) was a Jewel Supermarket where we bought breakfast foods and snack/sandwich foods to save some money on our trip.There is a Weber Grill restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel that has a fantastic buffet breakfast (we ate there on a Sunday morning...I don't know if it's an every-day thing or just weekends). Many, many, many other restaurants are located within walking distance. We walked to Gino's Pizza and Rainforest Cafe.If you want to take the subway, well, it's super-convenient, as the subway entrance is on the same corner as the hotel! We bought a multi-day pass and rode buses, subways, and El trains to all the tourist spots--John Hancock Building, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium, to name a few.Would also highly recommend &quot;Chicago Hauntings&quot; bus tour (can walk from hotel to tour embarkment) and Wendella's Lake and River tour (90 minutes)"
144,193,"Sep 12 2006 	Good Stay	We had a nice 4-night stay at this hotel for a mini vacation during the last week of August. The location was convenient and we walked to many things. The room was fairly spacious, clean, everything was in good shape and we had an ok view. It was fairly well equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron, internet service, etc. One thing I forgot to check for when booking was an in-room safe, which they did not have. They did have safe deposit boxes at the front desk and that worked fine for us. We requested a high floor and they followed through by putting us on the top floor. The staff was wonderful. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would return. Our Sun-Wed stay got us a free night, so it was a great deal for this class hotel."
145,193,"Sep 10 2006 	Paper Thin walls	This hotel has paper thin walls and you can hear evrything in the rooms next door and in the halls. I have stayed at 1 star motells that are more private. Also i called the hotel direct for reservations, and then they transfered me to the central call center. i knew where the hotel was because of the Weber Grill in the lobby. The reservation center said that they had several downtown lockations and could not be sure that the one that they were reserving for me was the one that I had asked for with out an adress."
146,193,"Sep 8 2006 	Worth every penny!	First I want to say that if it sounds a bit pricey to you, it definitely worths every penny. The location couldn't be more convenient, especially for a tourist in Chicago. In addition, we found the staff friendly and helpful, our room very nice, extremely clean and spacious. One of the best hotels I've ever stay, and will stay there again if I'm given the chance."
147,193,"Aug 30 2006 	Great Place to Stay Friendly Staff	I stayed 3 nights for a business trip. I was very surprised by how friendly all of the staff were, including the housekeepers and night shift! That was unusual. The room was comfortable, and there were lots of pluses (like complimentary internet access).I was not &quot;wowed&quot; by the bed and linens, but they were reasonably comfortable. It was a good value."
148,193,"Aug 23 2006 	Great location and great place	saw a 3 nights for the price of two promotion and booked. Saw another promotion on Travelzoo for $115 per night in August, could not beat that and booked. Arrived via the blue train and got lost. Tons of cabs and rode the cab four minutes to the hotel. It's noon and I wanted to check my bag because I scored a ticket to Wrigley on a Sunday. I'm standing in line for the desk when I spot two bellman walk onto the lobby. Tell the guy my situation and boom, claim ticket and down to the Red Line, off to see the Cubbies. Back to the hotel after 5pm and checkin not problem, in fact I think they pre assigned rooms, king non smoking. Same room design as my last stay, clean except for the drinking glasses. Microwave, mini fridge and comp pass to a real fitness gym one block away. Jewels grocery across the street. Rental car not needed as public transit is pretty fast. Did rent a car the last day to drive outside of downtown and returned by 5pm. Scored a parking meter one block away from the hotel, leaving by 7am, so free all night. Second stay in this city at this hotel. My third will be here too."
149,193,"Aug 17 2006 	What else can I say - Excellent!	Just returned from a five night stay at the Gardenn Inn and what can I say that hasen't already been said - this place it just excellent. We travel a lot and would highly recommend this hotel. The front desk are just awesome. They wear a &quot;No Problem&quot; badge and it isn't a gimmick, they will do just about anything for you! What a great location right by the red line. You won't be disappointed with this hotel. Also, as info since I have not seem this before, visit the Federal Reserve Bank, its free and where else can you get so close to one million bucks and leave with $364 for free! Also, check out the Blue Man group show for a great time and guess what, its right off the red line at Belmont and a quick ride back to the hote!"
150,193,"Aug 9 2006 	Great stay	Stayed with my wife for 6 nights from 31 July until 6 aug. US Airways managed to lose our baggage so on arrival check in staff provided us with toothbrush, toothpaste etc which was a nice touch. I had asked for a corner room as had been recommended and was given one.Hotel has all that is required including a 24 shop selling essentials, a starbucks, a smallish pool and hot tub. There is a business centre on the 12th floor with 3 terminals all providing free internet access and printers. On one occasion the printers weren't working so the front desk did the online flight check in for me.There is a Weber Grill attached to the hotel which does a great buffet breakfast for $12.95 and great food in the evening. There was a wait time of about an hour the evening we ate there, but I called down, mentioned I was staying in the hotel and got a table pretty quickly.Location is great. Metro stop outside and Navy Pier free trolley just round the corner. Rooms were cleaned very well and even clothes on the bed folded. All in all for a 3 star hotel, it was superb. Many people, including Americans we met en route were suprised that we'd take a vacation in Chicago, but it was fantastic. Go!"
151,193,"Aug 8 2006	Great.... but	My husband &amp; I just got back from a 4-night stay at the HIlton Garden Inn Chicago. Great location, convenient to all of the wonderful Mag Mile shopping and the red line train. The wonderful staff were able to answer any question you might have about how to get around the City, etc. Housekeeping was efficient, polite and thorough.My only complaint - the mattresses are horrible! I'm generally not a picky person, but sleeping on a board took it's toll after 4-nights. Until this hotel replaces its mattresses, I probably won't come back!"
152,193,"Aug 1 2006 	Hotel Staff is Five Star!	The hotel staff couldn't do enough for me! As part of our engagement evening, I had a couple special items to be delivered to our room at a specific time. They came through where other hotels have not. Why this hotel is not rated higher than 3 stars is beyond me!"
153,193,"Jul 3 2006	Excellent Stay	We enjoyed a four night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and could not have asked for more in a mid-range priced hotel. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and had the fresh look of a new or recently renovated space. The bathroom had very good water pressure in the shower, generous counter space and plenty of towels of adequate size. I loved the convenience of the mini fridge. A microwave was provided as well. The closet and drawer space was adequate. While the comfort level of the beds could not compare with my pillow top mattress at home, the mattresses and pillows provided a reasonable level of comfort for a hotel. They were firm without being too hard. While we had some traffic noise even on the 19th floor, the sound proofing within the hotel is excellent and we didn't hear any noise from the other rooms or even the hallway. The location is ideal for tourists with a Jewell grocery store across the street, across from the Red Line subway stop and near bus stops and you're within easy walking distance of some of Chicago's best restaurants and the shops on Michigan Ave.. We bought 3 day visitor's passes for unlimited travel on the transit system which was really easy to get around on. To get to the Art Institute or the Museum Campus walk to Upper Michigan and Illinois and take bus no. 146. To get to Lincoln Park Zoo walk to Grand and LaSalle and take bus no. 156. If you're interested in the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright visiting Oak Park makes for a fun day out. Take the Red Line to the Lake/Clark exit and transfer to the Green Line and get off at the Harlem stop. All the sights are within easy walking distance. To get to Second City take bus no. 36 from Grand and State. The Starbucks kiosk in the lobby sells pastries and coffee and Cosi is a chain about a block or two east on Grand that sells a good cheap breakfast. Also Mary's which is 2 or 3 blocks away. The front desk can give your directions. All in all a great place to stay."
154,193,Jun 18 2006	Loved the hotel !	An excellent night at the Hitlon Garden. Convenient and close to everything. Rooms are very nice and welcoming. Starbucks in the lobby is a plus. Service is great. No complaints at all. We recommend the hotel.. Try priceline for a good rate.
155,193,"Jun 16 2006 	Disappointing overpriced	I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights while traveling on business. The room rate of $359 per night was outrageous for an average to poor room with no amenities. The beds were not very comfortable, the pillows were flat, and the bedspreads were dirty. Yuck! It was a disappointing experience. Our room smelled like an overdose of air freshener and I had a sinus headache every morning."
156,193,"Jun 15 2006	My Kind of Place	We celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn. It was so much better than I expected. The room was wonderful, a corner view, Room 2170, and clean and bright. I would recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to chicago. I was really having a hard time deciding but price was finally the deciding factor. I was pleasantly surprised to have everything, including location, be so wonderful. the hotel delivered a bottle of champagne and complimentary breakfast passes because it was our anniversary. The staff was pleasant, friendly and very helpful with all of our questions."
157,193,"Jun 5 2006	A Perfect Place for a Birthday	We chose this hotel from the many available due to the comments made and the value offered. We were not disappointed in the least. From the check in to check out, everything was wonderful except for the last night when housekeeping missed us which we think was due to having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door till 10:00AM. One call asking for them to do the room at 5PM when we left for a baseball game was all we needed. We were very lucky to get the 2107, a beautiful corner room with a wonderful view. It was my 50th birthday and management sent up a bottle of champagne. What a lovely touch. This hotel has a great location. 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile, kiddy corner from Nordstrom's, 2 blocks from the river, right in front of the subway to the baseball park! Very safe. We felt safer in downtown Chicago then most places we have ever been. The people are great, the number of excetional resturants in walking distance is amazing. Do try Osteria via Stato, just around the corner on State Street. $39.95 prix fix menu that is incredible and thus why it was named to the Bon Appetit magazine top 50 restauirants in the USA. Great value.Back to the hotel, the bed is very comfortable and the window opened althought the noise even on the 21st floor could be a little loud but it is a big city. We thought the room size was just right for 2 and would definately stay here again for its value, service and location. The full breakfast at Weber's downstairs and that came with the room had everything we needed. Bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs or made to order, french toast or made to order panckaes and omlettes. Fruit and a selection of breads rounded out the selction completed with fresh coffee and fresh juices. Had a great birthday and hope to come back soon!"
158,193,"Apr 25 2006	Disappointing	The motto du jour of presumably the entire Garden Inn chain is &quot;100% problem free&quot;. If only that were true! We were initially assigned a fully accessible room, although neither of us requires nor requested such an accomodation. For those not in the know, full accessibility features a cavernous washroom with double-wide door, an extra-tall toilet, has a curtained-off alcove lined with rungs of handrails in lieue of a bathtub, and displays an inconveniently-placed showerhead (think YMCA). This was, in fact, a &quot;problem&quot; for my soak-craving partner, so we immediately called to request a new room. In exchanging the keys we were relieved of our two coupons for free bottles of water from the ill-stocked and un-manned pantry beside the front desk. Upon arrival one floor up we noted that, contrary to our registration profile, we were directly between the elevators and the ice machine, and that this new room was also accessible (although not to the degree that the previous one had been). Tired from our flight, we endured the almost constant traffic outside our door and within the wall at the head of our bed where the elevators whirred and hummed until the next morning. We also had to unplug the noisy (and empty) bar fridge, which commenced emitting a sour smell. A second call to the front desk generated assurances that the bellboy would be up momentarily with keys to a third room. After 15 minutes a third call prompted the receptionist to inform us she would be delivering them personally. As we waited in the hall outside our room with all our baggage for a further 10 minutes we had to let ourselves back in to answer a call telling us they were now actually really truly on their way. Meeting us by the elevators we were assured that we had been moved to a corner room on the second-to-highest floor, far from the elevators and stairwells. It was, in fact, not a corner room, and was also directly across the hall from a stairwell. It did, however, have a normal bathroom and a better view. Over our short stay I noted that housekeeping did not thouroughly clean the tub and toilet, nor did they fully replenish the amenities on more than one occasion. The bedside table contained not only the requisite bible, but also a discarded porn magazine! Most troubling, though, was that this hotel does not offer room service, opting instead to rely on the services of third-party restaurants in the neighbourhood that close early, open late and specialize only in steak and pasta. As such, we requested cutlery and plates from the front desk to eat our carry-out of Indian food, but they simply never arrived... I wish we hadn't either."
159,193,"Apr 21 2006	absolutely fantastic!	My wife and I stayed there on a &quot;fun&quot; trip from April 17-20,2006 and had a great time. The hotel room was clean and spacious with no unpleasant surprises. The staff was courteous and helpful at all times. We ate at the on-site Weber Grill upon arrival and had the best burger in our lives,complete with fries and cole slaw, all for $10.00 each. Most in hotel restaurants are priced out of our league but we were very satisfied and comfortable here. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;, 5 blocks from Navy Pier and five minutes from bus service to the Museums (Bus 146-remember that!)We had plans to go somewhere else over Memorial Day but have decided to return to Chicago and the Hilton instead.....our stay was that great..."
160,193,"Apr 10 2006 	One of the better value-for-money deal	I was in Chicago for 2 weeks and stayed at HGI from 27/3-31/3. I've also stayed at two other 'inn'-type of hotels in Chicago downtown area as HGI was full during the busy Apr convention/conferences/exhibition/spring break month. For $139 pernight, I got a single rm with microwave, mini-fridge and the plus:free Internet connection! (most other places charges abt $10perday). The room was clean and bathroom was well-stocked. The Netrugena line of products was a nice touch. The staff was very nice and friendly as well.The location was ideal: a trip from Ohare airport to hotel costs only USD2 and the subway station is just right outside the entrance! It was convenient to get groceries with Jewell Osco opposite the hotel and not to mention the numerous eating places nearby. I was definitely spoilt for choices! :)I've been to other hotels and this is defnitely one of the better one (under $150 bracket-type) in Chicago."
161,193,Apr 8 2006	hgi very satisfactory	stayed for 3 nights with last night in sofitel which i will review shortly.location is excellant with jewel shop and subway stop across road and mag mile around corner.room good size with fridge etc and clean.staff always helpful.weber grill attached to it lively-breakfast average.hgi not luxurious but very comfortable and well priced.fridge in room a bit noisy so we plugged it out overnight!in summary no hesitation in recomending hgi.
162,193,"Apr 6 2006	Great Stay -- A few hiccups though	My husband and I checked into the Hilton Garden Inn on 3/27/06 and stayed until 3/31/06 and we had a marvelous trip to the Chicago. We saw a taping of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; (bizarre and sureal), went to see the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Oriental Theater (highly recommended) and went to see the Black Hawks defeat the St. Louis Blues in overtime (!) at the United Center. We ate excellent meals at both Heaven on Seven and Redfish (see my seperate review for Redfish). We also ate at Mother Hubbards which seemed more like a drinking establishment and not a dinner place (I would not recommend the ostrich burger). The HGI was an excellent base for our stay and was within walking distance for virtually everything we did (although we did take an express bus to and from the hockey game which is highly recommended at $2.00 per person each way). The Sears Tower was quite a hike from the HGI but it was a lovely day so we did walk back AND forth (but hey it gave us license for eating a great dinner with no guilt)!After taking a cab from Union Station we checked into the HGI on Monday but our key card did not open the door properly and took many tries (typically 4) to get the door to open. This problem happened virtually each and every time we tried to get into our room. Frustrating yes, but we learned to laugh about it and took bets on how many times it would take! Once inside our room we instantly noticed there were no pillows -- bizarre but we phoned down to request some and we were told they were to be sent up. Later while unpacking we noticed there was not an iron, only an ironing board. When we went out to grocery/snack/wine shop at the Jewel-Osco store (how nice to have a full service grocery store so close by) across the street later that afternoon we asked the front desk to send us an iron and also mentioned the room was still without pillows. They apologized and assured us everything would be taken care of. When we returned 30 minutes later there was a knock on the door and an iron appeared but still NO pillows. It was only after a phone call from the front desk checking on the iron, that we reminded them that we still had no pillows. The pillows were then quickly dispatched. I hate to sound like a complainer as these were certainly minor issues but they seemed odd as a cleaning person would certainly notice the absence of pillows and probably notice the missing iron. By the way -- the rest of the week the cleaning service was excellent so this could have been just a strange occurrance.I would definately stay at the HGI again and the rate of $139 per night was VERY reasonable. We are not needy nor demanding people so the king bed non-smoking room we requested (and received) suited our needs just fine (really it was GREAT)! We also loved the business center where we could check our email, and I was able to get more info regarding the express bus to the United Center saving us tons of money on a cab. We also appreciated the mini-refrigerator but did not use the coffee maker nor the microwave. Unfortunately we were too lazy or too tired after some late nights -- that's our story and we are sticking too it -- to use the pool or the exercise center but they looked great. Also kudos for the blackout curtains at the HGI and they should be standard at every hotel as they overlap in the center so there is not a large ray of light streaming into the room each morning.All in all we had a FABULOUS trip to Chicago and the location and ammenities of the Hilton Garden Inn really allowed us to enjoy our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly attempt to use it again when we return!!"
163,193,"Mar 25 2006	Greta place to stay in Chicago Downtown!	I just returned from a stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. I booked this room based on the reviews posted on the trip advisor web site. I stayed 4 nights with my college-aged daughter and her friend. This hotel was exactly what I had hoped for. It was centrally located in downtown Chicago, directly across the street from the Grand Street EL station (red line-north). We purchased visitor passes and used the EL extensively. The desk staff was excellent! They gave us 2 bottled waters and a great room with a view. When we mentioned that we had reservations at PF Changs restaurant(at the end of the block), they gave us coupons for a free appetizer. Whenever we asked for directions to a certain loaction, the staff provided us a mapquest map to get to our destination. The price was excellent. All the rooms have a small fridge and microwave and there is access to a business center that has computer terminals and printers. I highly recommend this hotel as a GREAT place to stay in downtown Chicago."
164,193,"Mar 23 2006	Just Ok I think Homewood Suites is a better Hilton choice	Just returned. The rooms are clean, small, and just OK. Housekeeping is a weak link. The first day of our stay we returned to the room about 4:30 and no housekeeping. We went downstairs to wait in the lobby. About 5:15 I asked at the front desk where I was told &quot;there is no daily housekeeping unless you call&quot;. That seemed impossible to believe, but I complied by asking for housekeeping every day. (The desk clerk said, &quot;You really want housekeeping every day?&quot;) We are not difficult people, but even a Motel 6 has daily housekeeping for heaven's sake. They then put &quot;a rush&quot; on our room, and 45 minutes later we had clean towels but no clean sheets. We paid $139 and for that price I gave it three stars. Any more than that would be inappropriate. Valet parking is $36 a day, but we needed the &quot;unlimited&quot; aspects of that service. Unfortunately, we forgot to factor that in for a &quot;written in stone&quot; Sunday morning obligation, and were almost late when it took the better part of an hour to get our car. We had called ahead, and the valet boys were too busy counting their tips to go and fetch our vehicle. Finally, one of them asked if we needed help and we said we had called for our car before we left the room. At that point, one of the boys actually stuffed the folding money back into his pocket and went to get our car. Upon leaving, we waited several minutes for the valet boys to pocket their tips before moving a car that made it impossible for us to exit. Not cool.As Hilton Honors members we thought we would receive preference for our request of a &quot;high floor&quot;. Not so. We were originally placed on the 13th floor, and it was only because I asked about a corner room that we were placed on the 19th floor. And there are 23 floors, so that wasn't a &quot;view&quot; room. True, we are only &quot;gold&quot; level not platinum. Even so, 2 bottles of waters seemed like a minimal acknowledgement of our Hilton loyalty. While we were there we walked 50 steps to another Hilton property, the Homewood Suites. I talked to a staff member there who was really open about the property where Honors Gold members are automatically assigned to the 12th floor which we verified as being completely non-smoking and comprised of actual two-room suites which had all the amenities of Hilton Garden(free hot breakfast) plus free cocktails/dinner in the evening Mon.-Thurs.. A better choice if you have the extra $50 a night considering you also get a kitchen and guest laundry. All in all, having stayed at many downtown hotels, Homewood Suites is the best Hilton choice. Embassy Suites down the block has a crowded noisy lobby, minimal room furnishings, and is the most expensive. Hilton Garden Inn while clean and modest, has paper-thin walls and no real acknowledgement of Honors benefits."
165,193,"Mar 21 2006	Great Weekend	Just returned from a long weekend with my husband at the Hilton Garden Inn. We had a wondeful time - the room was very clean, location was great. The staff was very helpful in getting tickets for shows, and navigating the trains! Have stayed at the Westin and prefer this location better, close walk to the mile, and great restaurants. The red line and trolley to Navy Pier are just outside the front door. For the price, you can't beat the service or location! We can't wait to go back!"
166,193,"Mar 15 2006	Super!!!	Our family stayed for one night as a family weekend get away. The location was great. With a stroller and two young children the location of the hotel made it easy to get around. The free trolley service it right across the street and dropped us off right at the door to Navy Pier, and back again. We did use one of their free cribs, and being very picky thought it was good enough for my baby, although I did put my own sheet on it. We used the pool to entertain the kids, it did have a strange smell but was clean and fun. The bath tub actually could be filled to bath the kids after the pool.All of the staff was helpful and extremely nice. We are looking forward to staying here again."
167,193,"Mar 15 2006	Lovely helpful cheerful staff at the Garden	We spent two days mid-week here while visiting family. All the usual amenities were up to standard, but what we specially noticed was the cheerful and SO helpful staff, not so common downtown anywhere. The breakfasts were great too - continental was included in our stay, but for $1 each we could have `the works', including omeletttes and such cooked to order. This is the fifth Chicago hotel we've tried, and the first we've liked enough to want to come back to."
168,193,"Mar 4 2006	Great location. Great price. Great service.	I stayed on a Friday night for a short weekend visit. I paid $100, so didn't know what to expect. I was plesantly surprised. The staff was nice. The room was very nice with a good view of the city. The pool and hot tub were enjoyable. The only negative is the parking situation, but that is true at almost all hotels in downtown Chicago. The location was close to everything. I would definitely stay at this hotel again over many more expensive places."
169,193,"Feb 27 2006	Great!	Very good experience overall. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice--no complaints. The location is great. Check-out was very easy, didn't even have to stop by the front desk. I'd recommend it to anyone. Easy, no-hassle trip!"
170,193,"Feb 27 2006	Great value and location	Stayed in August for two nights with my girlfriend to see some baseball games. This was our second visit to Chicago and since this place had received favorable reviews we gave it a shot, turned out to be a great choice.Location - Great area north of the river about 3 blocks west of Michigan Ave and next to State St. One HUGE bonus is the subway station right outside the door, which came in handy for going to the baseball game. With the El, a 10 minute walk to Michigan Ave and plenty of retail estabishments nearby, a car is not needed. The area felt safe to walk in both day and night.Room - This is an older tower hotel, so the rooms are small as to be expected but adequate for 2 people. Air circulation was good and the bedding and furnishings were fine. Staff - Despite a late arrival, our King N/S Upper Floor was confirmed. The front desk staff guy was great, pointed out Bijon's American Bistro a couple of blocks away for a late night dinner. Also, when we needed a bandaid, instead of pointing us to a drugstore, they just gave us some from their own cabinet. Housekeeping was efficient and the room was clean.Amenities - A delicous breakfast was had at Weber's. We did not go there for dinner or use pool/gym. Lobby is rather small and except for a small nook with snacks/toiletries there is not much else in the way of services. Weber's is their only restaurant.Price - rate through Hilton Website was $170 nt for a midweek stay. I am sure that a weekend rate is less and probably would include breakfast. As a HHonors member we got free bottled water which was nice in the warm weather. As I always say, there is no reason NOT to use the Hilton website and sign up for HHonors, the price is the same and the chances are much better that you won't get bumped or put in a crummy room if the place is full.This is a great place to stay if you are looking for quality, value and a good location. If you want more of a full service hotel with more luxuries then you may want one of the larger places directly on Michigan Ave."
171,193,"Feb 22 2006	Average hotel	We picked the coldest weekend of this year to visit Chicago. Lucky us. My husband and I took our 7 year old to Chicago for some sightseeing and fun. His favorite part of the weekend was, of course, the pool. The pool was very small. Five families filled the pool and made it very crowded. The hot tub was very very hot. I enjoy hot tubs but this water was just too hot. I was scared for the small children who did go in it. Everyone you saw came out with very red skin. The location of this hotel is nice. Espn Zone is in it's backyard which is nice for 7 year old boys. We had a nice time but the Hilton didn't overly thrill us."
172,193,"Feb 20 2006	This will be our Chicago home from now on!	Feb. 17-18: I took a girls trip with two friends. I am a Chicago native that wanted to show my 'Frisco friends what a great city Chicago is. From start to finish, the Hilton was the BEST! First, after arriving at 10 am from Midway (EL Orange line txf to Red line at Roosevelt to Grand stop - FYI - the EL drops you off RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel), we thought we'd drop off our luggage and shop until we could check-in (3 pm). To our surprise and delight, the desk said that our room was ready THEN! As a Hilton Honors member, we were also given vouchers for 2 bottles of water (or one large) and $5 to use towards their pantry (snacks and stuff). Also included was breakfast for the 3 of us (Weber Grill is inside the hotel). It included a continental at the Weber, a Venti &amp; Pastry at the Starbucks (also in the Hotel), or, for $1 more, a Deluxe breakfast with made to order omelettes and pancakes. So off we went after a rest to see Chicago! At 10:30 that eve, we were looking for a restaurant for a late dinner, and the desk had an extensive list (with pricing) and even called ahead to check on seating and hours. We had a wonderful meal (GREAT STAFF AS WELL) at the recommended Volare (201 E. Grand). The rooms were clean, the staff was not just accomodating, they went above and beyond (too many times to mention here!). STAY HERE - you won't regret it! BTW: 137.33/night at the Hilton website."
173,193,"Feb 8 2006 	Great location; great staff; great price	Great price, consistently helpful, friendly staff, very clean and nice, small touches everwhere. I had a corner room w/ two windows, a microwave. refrigerator, easy chair and a very nice closet and bathroom for $130 night. Of course, it was February so I assume that price is seasonal. I would pay quite a bit more to stay there regardless. Near Nordstroms, a small grocery store &amp; other retail that comes in handy. Also free use of Crunch gym almost next door (as well as a nice hotel gym). The Weber Grill restaurant had a reasonably priced breakfast buffet with excellent service and nice &quot;to go&quot; options. A very well run hotel. I wish there were more like it. Will definitely stay there again."
174,193,"Jan 30 2006	Great hotel	I stayed here between Christmas and New Years and the hotel staff was amazing. My frequent flier account wasn't attached to my HHonors account and the rep at check in insisted she take care of it and then followed up with a call saying it was done. The room was immaculate, modern (bed not the most comfy)and the heating worked well. The fridge and microwave were very clean. Kudos to the business center, they have a color printer available for guest use and the remote printing feature from your room is great and secure! Location is great being next door to PF changs and a short walk to Nordstrom on Michigan Ave."
175,193,"Jan 27 2006 	Excellent hotel. Great value for money	Just wanted to follow up earlier reviews. This hotel has to be one of the best deals in town. I prepaid my stay through [--------] and for just $89 + tax got a great room. Like other reviewers with hhonors membership, I was given a voucher for a more than adequate continental breakfast, free vouchers for bottled water and other goods from the 24hour pantry. Service was excellent throughout. Location is pretty quiet for Chicago, a reasonable walk to just about everything but with a red line subway station right outside the door. For me at least, a much better choice than previous stays in and around the Loop. Overall, highly recommended."
176,193,Jan 21 2006	Very Nice Hotel at Reasonable Price	Great Location. The service is always great at check in and check out. For the cost a great downtown MI AVE hotel.
177,193,"Jan 11 2006 	Loved it	I found out about this hotel via Tripadvisor and I can tell you the reviews were right on the money. The place is excellent, very clean, and the the service is impeccable. I think this hotel is one best places to stay in Chicago without spending a fortune."
178,193,"Dec 28 2005	Great place to stay	I stayed here with my brother when we came over from the UK to see a Bears game. It's in a great location a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave) and within walking distance of The Loop. We even walked to Soldier Field and back but you might want to hop on a bus or the subway which has a stop almost right outside the door. The hotel was everything we hoped it would be - rooms were nice and clean and the staff were friendly. We had a great view of the John Hancock Center from our corner room (other rooms have the possibility of views of the top of Sears Tower). The attached Webber Grill offered a breakfast buffet every morning for a reasonable price, which was very convenient. I'd definitely stay here again."
179,193,"Dec 27 2005	Far above the crowd	I stayed at this hotel twice in December 2005. The front desk staff was very friendly and genuinely concerned with the quality of my hotel stay each time.(One clerk even said &quot;Welcome home!&quot;) Being a Hilton Gold member, I was given a top-floor room, vouchers for breakfast, Starbucks coupons, bottled water coupon, and a $5 coupon to the gift/snack shop. The room was nicely proportioned with a comfortable bed, mini-bar with a microwave, and a desk with complementary Internet service. The bathroom was moderate in size, very clean, and well-lit. Overall, the hotel floor was quiet and orderly. I found a parking spot on the street so I didn't have to pay for parking (after 6pm on Saturday, the parking was free at the meters I found right across from the hotel entrance).The breakfast vouchers were for continental breakfast at the Weber Grill, but one can upgrade to a full breakfast for a dollar (total $9.95 if paying without a voucher). I found the food and atmosphere to be appetizing and inviting. This is a steal in Chicago for an unlimited breakfast buffet. I must reiterate that the staff of this hotel make it stand far above its competitors. I have stayed at other hotels with more &quot;stars&quot;, but the HGI Chicago Downtown deserves more than 2.5 for the superior &quot;can do&quot; attitude of its staff and its vast array of guest services."
180,193,"Dec 19 2005 	Fantastic	Great Location, great views, very quiet - the only inconvenience was the high cost for parking, but it's worth it. There is a grocery store right around the corner which helps since you have a microwave and fridge in your room. Not one major complaint about my stay which is rare. This is, to use a phrase I saw earlier, a hidden gem in the city."
181,193,"Dec 6 2005	A hidden treasure	This hotel was wonderful and much more than I expected. It's new, modern, the furnishings in the room are new, coffee maker and fridge in the room. The front desk employees were ready to help with directions and any way they could. The icing on the cake is the location! It's close to everything. Right in the heart of shopping a couple blocks from North Michigan Avenue. A short walk to the stores on State and the theater district. Right around the corner from the hotel is a grocery store! Perfect!The lobby has a modern, minimal look. There is a high priced mini convienent store right off the front desk. A starbucks in the lobby, with very pleasant employees. I won this hotel on Priceline it's labeled as a 2.5 star. It's way better than that. Whether you win this hotel in a bid or purchase it, you can't loose. The only negative was room service for breakfast. It was overpriced and horrible. Skip the room service and go to Starbucks in the lobby.This is a hidden tresure in the city of Chicago."
182,193,"Nov 22 2005	Definitely stay again	Superb location, very nice room and friendly, helpful staff. Had booked thru Priceline ($50 per night). Arrived at 5am with the hope that I could leave my luggage and check-in later - no problem, my room was ready and also given free breakfast vouchers (HH Gold). Late check-out was no problem. I called as the free high speed internet would not connect in my room and within 10 minutes they rebooted the system and was working perfectly. Room was clean and decent size and bed was comfortable. Definitely stay again."
183,193,"Nov 9 2005	Very nice place to stay	The Hilton Garden Inn is a nice place to stay. Great location, with subway stop right in front of hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. One exception: the dust ruffle on the bed was torn all the way around. Why that would be I don't know. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. Room was a tad small but ok for us. The staff was exceptionally friendly. They moved us to a higher floor on check-in when they heard that our relatives were up there. Housecleaning crew didn't clean our room till after 4 pm on Friday. There is no breakfast buffet but there is a corner bakery down the street with great breakfast choices. One suggestion: you may want to choose another place to eat besides the hotel's weber grill restaurant. Chicago has so many great places to eat. We didn't eat there but my relatives said the Weber grill is expensive and the food just ok."
184,193,"Nov 2 2005	Nice hotel excellent location!	We (family of 4) stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Chicago for 3 nights. The desk staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean, and we really appreciated the fridge and microwave in the room, especially since there was a grocery/drug store right across State Street from the hotel! This saved us quite a bit of money, being able to eat breakfast and a light dinner/snack in the room.I loved the location, too. There's a subway stop right outside the doorway of the hotel. We parked our car at the hotel ($21/night, no in-out privleges), bought 2-day CTA visitor passes for $9 each and used combinations of subways, els, and buses to get around Chicago. Two nights we ate dinner at restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (there are LOTS of restaurants nearby!). We ate breakfast in our room 2 mornings, but on Saturday morning we ate downstairs at the Weber Grill. They had an excellent and very reasonably priced breakfast buffet. I don't know if this buffet is available every morning or just on weekends.I would definitely stay here again!"
185,193,"Oct 9 2005 	Love this hotel	This is the second time I have stayed here and I was again very impressed.The rooms are clean, comfortable and good sized. Beds are very comfortable and I love having a large work desk, fridge and microwave (although having some eating utensils would be even better).The Webber Grill downstairs and PF Changs supplying room service are also great as I was there on business alone, and food is excellent. The bar is very friendly and having Starbucks morning coffee available in the lobby is spot on.The pool is very small and workout area adequate, but you can go next door to the &quot;Crunch&quot; Gym if so inclined.The location of this hotel is second to none. Slap in the middle of town, a block from Mich. Ave with everything else in walking distance. Staff are very friendly and helpful, my only complaint is that the room service seemed very sparse on a Friday and my room still had not be cleaned by 3pm, however this was the only time.Would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are a single female in town...I felt very safe."
186,193,"Oct 5 2005	MY KIND OF TOWN MY KIND OF HOTEL	What a great hotel, I do declare. The Hilton Garden Inn is ideally located right near State Street and about a three minute walk to Michigan Avenue. You're steps from great shopping, beautiful architecture and everything you could possibly want. I went with my newly-appointed fiancee to celebrate our engagement. We took a cab to the hotel - it was about $50 on account of a lot of traffic. Next time, I would definitely take the EL (we took it going to O'hare upon departing Chicago and it was really easy). Check in to the hotel was quick and efficient. We had a corner room on the 22nd floor with a northern view out of one window, and an eastern view out of the other - both of them of the Chicago skyline. Room was clean and beds were comfortable (we opted for two queen beds because we are engaged, not married, so I can assure you there was no hanky panky - just kidding, we opted for the king and I can assure you the springs are broken). All in all, it was a pleasant stay and there were zero problems. Other points worth noting: The homeless in Chicago are very friendly. Rush Street has some great bars. For breakfast we walked along Rush heading north about 10 minutes to Einsetin Brothers Bagels (worth the walk). Spend an afternoon at Navy Pier. It's beautiful there. Take the EL going back to O'hare (or Midway) - the hotel will give you directions and everybody takes it so you won't be alone. Be careful of Chicago's famous deep-dish pizza. You'll get fat."
187,193,"Aug 29 2005	Definite Recommendation for Anyone	Whether for business or pleasure, I think this is a great hotel. I was staying there for a wedding a few weekends ago and had a blast.Location: It is very centrally located and the advantage it has from it's rival hotels located on the Mag. Mile is that it is not crazy busy when you step out of the front door. The Mag. Mile is less than a 2 min. walk away. Several times, when my wife and I went shopping, we were able to run back to the Hilton and drop off our bags. We also had a couple of nice morning runs down to the Navy Pier and got to see the Air Show practice one of the mornings. Staff: People were very helpful and willing to help. The young, tall African gentleman at the door was helpful with my bags when I arrived and equally as helpful when we left. We must've asked about 50 questions to the front desk on recommendations for late night bars/clubs/eats and they accomodated each one. Rooms: Room was very clean and we did enjoy having the mini-fridge in the room w/ microwave for all of the left over food we had after eating out!We stayed in 2205, second floor from the top and had a great view of the Chicago skyline, including the John Hancock Tower.I will post pics soon. I would definitely stay there again next time I go! I just have to let my arteries clear of the stuffed pizza courtesy of Giordano's!"
188,193,"Aug 28 2005	excellent hotel	We stayed three nights after booking a good deal on the Hilton website. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room. The room was clean and comfortable. Ours was on the 18th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape. For the money it is a great hotel. Clean, comfortable, friendly, affordable and in a good location. I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again.We also took a tour wich they recommend us was great . We are planning another trip to chicago and we ll stay for sure at the hiltons"
189,193,"Aug 10 2005	Nice stay at the Hilton Garden	We stayed three nights in early August after booking a good deal on the Hilton website. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave. and the Art Institute without any difficulties. (We found a shortcut through Nordstrom's to Michigan. The store is very close to the hotel, just walk through and you come right out on Michigan. It saves a little time and walking.)The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room. There are two restaurants onsite: Weber Grill and P.F. Changs. Both will provide room service for a small fee. There is also a Starbucks kiosk in the lobby in the morning.The room was clean and comfortable. Ours was on the 18th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape.My only &quot;complaint&quot;: The pool is nice, but very small. The elevators can also be very slow at times.Overall, for the money it is a great hotel. Clean, comfortable, friendly, affordable and in a good location. I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again."
190,193,"Jul 19 2005	Fantastic Staff	My friends and I recently went on a two week holiday in the states and visited New York, Vegas and finally Chicago where we stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn.I had a mixed experience with the hotels in New York and Vegas, however, found the Hilton Garden Inn to be fantastic. The staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out. We stayed for three days and I was overwhelmed by the friendliess we recieved. The Webber Grill is a great restaurant with good old American sized porrtions and a large selection to choose from. Also the hotel bar had informal and friendly staff who were up for a laugh and once again couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome.The Hotel is located beside the magnificent mile and is therefore great for this who love to shop etc etc. Also there are plenty of bars / restaurants nearby for socialising and late night drinking!! I use Trip Advisor to help me book hotels and have never before written a review. I must say that the staff here were by far the best I have ever experienced. Everything from booking restaurants to recommending good nightlife to arranging travel to and from baseball games was all part of the service provided the guys at the Hilton.Definitely recommend it if you want a centrally located, Clean, modern and friendly hotel experience in the heart of Chicago."
191,193,"Jul 11 2005	Nice hotel. Great Location	Hotel was clean and in good condition. Staff was extremely helpful and was very good at giving us different restaurant ideas. Having been to Chicago numerous times, it was nice to get different ideas and having them pan out. Rooms were clean and had everything you would need. Not spectacular rooms, but very nice."
192,193,"Jun 30 2005 	Great hotel great location	I was very pleased with this hotel from the moment I walked through the doors. Every hotel employee was very friendly and the service was very good. The room was large, very clean and well appointed. There was a refrigerator, microwave and free high-speed internet access. The blanket was sandwiched between two sets of sheet, which was a nice touch. Also, while the hotel was full I found that at most I had to wait a minute for one of the elevators, a fact I really appreciated. The location is excellent - within two blocks of the magnificent mile, half mile from navy pier, mile from the Art Institute, near public transportation and surrounded by restaurants. The area also felt very safe even late at night. The only area that could use minor improvements was house-keeping. The last afternoon I was there I was changing to go out aroud 4:30 and house-keeping walked in without knocking as they had left some cleaning supplies in the room. They were very apologetic and mentioned that they would be right back with clean towels. When I returned at 7:30 there were still no towels and it dawned on me that there had been no new towels the evening before, we had had extras in the room and used them. I called the front desk - they were very apologetic, said they had had a problems with the linen service and that they would be right up with them. A colleague also had the same problem and found it necessary to call the desk. On a minor note I had made coffee the first morning and it wasn't replaced until the 4th day, and the sugar and stirrers were not replaced. If not for these house-keeping issues I would have rated this hotel with five stars."
193,193,"Jun 13 2005	Great hotel downtown	Stayed there 5/31/05-6/03. Location is excellent and close to Mag. Mile and Museum, Art Institute, Aquarium, and Planetarium. All are within walking distanceThe staff was very accomodating and allowed us to check in early and leave our luggage on check out to do some shopping.The breakfast buffet was terrific, but could use more fresh fruits. The only mild downer was the in-room air conditioner which was occasionally noisy at night.Would definitely stay there again and I'd give it a solid 3-3 1/2 stars.Galoha"
194,193,"May 30 2005	Great Stay	Great hotel! The rooms are very clean and the bathroom is totally up-to-date. No problems with the plumbing, etc. No bugs, either. The staff is very nice, also. The Webber Grill is pretty pricey, but there are plenty of other places around there to eat at. I definitely would stay there again!"
195,193,"Apr 27 2005	Good central location	This hotel is great if you need a cheaper option that is centrally located. The beds are nothing to write home about, but the room is clean, and the front desk is extremely helpful. The location cannot be beat - it's close to everything. I have also stayed at the Talbot and I definitely would rather be here. The service and location is better. They accomodated my every request. It is not a romantic hotel in style, but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it."
196,193,Apr 17 2005	Great hotel. Loved it and would return	Great value and centrally located for restaurants. Stayed here 3 nights after Easter. Saved $20 per night with Honors Membership. You'll get a free pass to Crunch which is a very nice private fitness club. Lobby connects to Weber's Grill which has great food. Michigan Ave is only a few blocks away. Had more fun shopping at the smaller shops on the side streets.
197,193,"Apr 9 2005	What a great place to stay!	My husband, son (11), daughter (9) and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for three nights in March, 2005. What a great experience we had! The room was clean, the staff was extremely friendly and the location couldn't be beat. We got the internet rate of $109 which was a deal. It was great having a small refrigerator in the room for drinks (microwave too, although we didn't use it) . There's a great grocery store just across the street. The kids enjoyed swimming in the indoor pool--despite it's small size, it was perfect for them. We ate dinner at the Weber Grill and it was teriffic. Not one complaint about this hotel; I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
198,193,"Apr 6 2005	Wonderful stay!	We just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Chicago. It was fantastic. The staff was wonderful from the moment we checked in until we left...this included the valet at the door, the porter, the front desk staff and the maids. Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The room was average size and very clean. We were in room 2203 on the Hilton Honors floor (the hotel has 23 floors). Our room was far from the elevator and very quiet. We had a view of the Sears Tower...which our boys loved. Our 8 and 9 year old boys swam in the pool (indoors). The pool is a &quot;play&quot;pool and only 4 feet deep and not huge. It was never crowded and they had a great time. The spa held 5 people max. Although not used the workout room looked nice. We opted for self park since we knew we wouldn't be using our car- this is $21 per 24/hrs and does NOT offer in/out privlages. The valet parking has unlimited in/out privlages and is $35/day. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again."
199,193,"Mar 23 2005	Beautiful friendly secure...	I work at a Hilton Garden Inn in another city and was not disappointed by the quality of this hotel, by any means. The guest service and valet staff was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.Our guest room was incredibly clean, at a comfortable temperature and even had a decent view, for being surrounded by high rises. We bugged the front desk staff multiple times for directions, locations of attractions, recommendations, etc. Every time they were just as happy to help as if it were our first question.Our do not disturb sign was on from check in to check out and we were not disturbed once! In my experience with past stays at other hotels throughout the years, a do not disturb sign still means we can be bothered about towels and such. It was a pleasure to have the room all to ourselves.Our stay was the weekend before St. Patrick's day. The parade was happening as well as the green coloring of the river. The elevators were only accessible by key card. It was nice to have such security with a hard-partying crowd outside! The hotel is connected with a P.F. Chang's and another great restaurant; the name escapes me-they make grills, though. These restaurants will deliver to your room, if you like!! There's nothing like Chang's chicken lettuce wraps and mago iced tea in your pajamas!!If you get the chance, I highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Chicago."
200,193,"Mar 23 2005	Great Weekend At The Hilton Garden Inn	Just spent a super three- day weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn. Got a great rate of $109.00 from the Hilton web-site. Not super fancy but very clean, new appearance. Staff were all very helpful and pleasant. Did breakfast each morning at The Webber Grill. Great location. Lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Took the free trolley to Navy Pier. This DuPage County kid and friends are already planning our next get away to Chicago and will definitely stay here again."
201,193,"Mar 22 2005	Satisfactory stay	My wife and I stayed at the Hilton right before Thanksgiving in 2004. Average hotel but we weren't at the hotel very much at all. Good location and Weber Grill Restaurant in lobby is very good. Our rate was $139,"
202,193,Mar 16 2005	Great service great value	We stayed at the this hotel for three nights last week and were really impressed. For the money ($170 Hilton website) this hotel is a real value for its excellent location. The staff was consistently helpful and friendly. Excellent management.
203,193,"Mar 16 2005	Very pleasant hotel great value and great location	I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 4 days after Christmas. I got a fabulous deal (less than $90 night: tax included). It was clean, quiet, a good size and a fabulous location. While it is not the height of luxury, it is comfortable and the surroundings are very pleasant. I literally could find no fault with the hotel. I would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago."
204,193,"Mar 9 2005	regal hotel	The Hilton is a regal grand hotel. We stayed on the excutive floor. The room was a little small but a nice view of the park at a resonable price. Some freebee's are the beautiful Botanical Gardens, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Buckingham Fountain. Downtown offers an array of dinning. We ate at Fridays which was within walking distance to our hotel. Navy Pier is a must, but you'll want to find parking on the street. Second City is great for laughs at a reasonable price. The Shed Aquarium, although a little pricey is a Must see. For those romatics take a carriage ride around the city for about $30. There are lots of other great musems to visit too."
205,193,"Jan 24 2005	Very Enjoyable Stay	Have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and will definately be staying here again.The location was superb ; 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue and surrounded by a large range of restaurants and shops. The staff were extremely pleasant and friendly at all times and the whole hotel seems brand new and clean. The free internet access from all rooms is a huge bonus,as is the fridge in the room. The only small problem we had was that you had to run the hot tap for about 5 minutes until the hot water came for the shower.But I think this was more to do with the location of our room at the end of a long corridor with no adjoining rooms.I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a Chicago break: and I'm usually a very fussy hotel guest!"
206,193,"Jan 6 2005	Very comfortable	Though this place doesn't have the charm of some of the older hotels in Chicago, it is very clean and comfortable. The best part is the pool on the 12th floor. If there aren't a bunch of frat boys in the hot tub, you might actually get a chance to relax and gaze out the fully windowed walls for the great view. We paid $96 for the room (2 double beds), but I wouldn't go much more than that. Not that it's not nice, but you can get a room in the Knickerbocker for that much. This just feels like most other Holiday Inn type places."
207,193,"Nov 24 2004	If you get a good rate this hotel is hard to beat!	I stayed at this property Nov. 11-13. The hotel was very nice and very clean. The Weber grill downstairs has a great breakfast menu and a good atmosphere at night. The location is perfect. 1/2 a block from ESPNZONE, Hard Rock Cafe, Rain Forest Cafe, Michigan Ave. My room was on the 15th floor and had a great view if the Sears Tower. I booked the room through Hilton's website and received a rate of $115 per night. I will stay at this property next time I am in CHI-TOWN..."
208,193,"Nov 4 2004	Would definitely stay here again	We stayed here for 3 nights in july. The room was very clean, spacious and had an amazing view. The staff were friendly and very helpful, we were shown to our room by a member of staff to check that we thought there was enough room for the rollaway beds that we required. There was plenty of room for the rollaway beds and they were brought up straight away. There was free internet access, a small pool, hot pool and small gym all of which we made good use of. The hotel is in a great location right outside of the El. We would definitely stay here again."
209,193,"Oct 9 2004	Great Hotel Fabulous Staff	We enjoyed our four day stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The room was neat and provided a lot of extras including microwave, refrigerator,etc.- for a reasonable price compared to other hotels. A wonderful location located a block away from Michigan Avenue without the noise. The continental breakfast that we paid for extra was worth it and having Starbucks in the hotel was also nice. The staff was excellent and if you want to make reservations, have them do it- they will get you in! We will stay there again on our next visit."
210,193,"Sep 22 2004	Great Stay at the Hilton Garden	Very pleased with our three day stay at Hilton Garden. Staff extremely courteous, check-in took less than a minute. Both the room and bathroom were very clean. Room was not huge, just nice size with king bed, work table, sofa chair and ottoman. Room was quiet, only occasionally disturbed by noisy people in hallway and passing fire truck 20 floors down. Location is hard to beat; two blocks from Michigan Ave. Tons of good restaurants within a few blocks, not to mention the Weber Grill in the same building. Only minor complaint would be noisy fridge, but turning the fridge down from max to medium setting took care of the issue. Since I would not rate this hotel as &quot;luxury&quot;, I would have hard time paying the $290 flat rate per night. If you can get the room at a discount like I did, it's defintely the top choice. Valet parking a little pricey if you are staying more than two nights, you can save a few bucks with self park."
211,193,"Sep 16 2004 	great staff!	We stayed at this hotel with two small children while my husband was in town for a trade show. We've stayed at many downtown hotels and I have to say that I've never experienced such a wonderful staff! The valet guys, the bellmen, the front desk and even housekeeping were not only helpful in every way, but went out of their way to be friendly and available. They treated our children like honored guests! The hotel is clean, new and updated and has a good location - but the staff is what makes it an excellent choice."
212,193,"Sep 13 2004 	Excellent hotel	This place is what you should expect in a hotel. Great service, great rooms, great amenities, and great location. I stayed here for a trade show for two nights and was extremely pleased my entire trip. The location is walking distance or a $5 cab ride to anywhere downtown. Feel free to ask any employee anything about the city or the hotel because they all seemed competent as well as eager to help."
213,193,"Sep 7 2004	nice and clean	We stayed at the Chicago Hilton Garden Inn over the Labor Day weekend and were delighted. It is very clean, not tired and worn out, but seems bright and new. The one special thing I liked was a top sheet on top of the blanket. I very much appreciated not having to touch that blanket. It also had all of the amenities e.g. microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, computer connections, etc. The room was not especially large, but we spent relatively little time in the room - only to sleep. We would definitely stay here again."
214,193,Aug 27 2004 	Two Thumbs Up... WAY Up!	We cant wait to return to Chicago and this hotel. A nice hotel in a great location. Clean and comfortable. Starbucks coffee available in the lobby. Awesome shopping all around and a wonderful restaurant downstairs and numerous restaurants nearby. The hotel amenities are great and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. An overall GREAT value. We definitely recommend it!
215,193,"Aug 6 2004	My choice for Chicago	Some friends and I went to Chicago last month. We knew we wanted to be near Michigan Avenue, so we chose the Hilton Garden Inn. A bargain at $109 a night, whereas most of the other hotels we saw were much more expensive. It turned out to be great. The room is nothing fancy, but certainly nice and it was very clean (microwave in room is a nice extra). However, the drawing card is the location. It can't be beat. Within walking distance are many shops, restaurants, pubs, a blues bar, and a piano bar. We were all very pleased with our choice and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great place to stay without breaking the bank."
216,193,"Jul 16 2004	very nice hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 4 days in the first week of July. The hotel is very well located, 5 minutes and you are on the magnificent mile. The rooms are neat, clean, nicely furnished. The front desk staff is really nice and helpful. Hotel is surrounded by restaurants, malls.... There is a supermarket in front of the hotel and you can buy all you need. There is a fridge in the room and a microwave, always helpful. I tried their restaurant Webber Grill and it was really good food, their black and blue burger is awesome... Starbucks is open in the lobby... great for morning coffee on the go...I will definitely stay there next time I am in Chicago."
217,193,"Jun 27 2004	great place to stay in chicago	this hilton gardens was the place to stay. at 99.00 a night through hilton.com this was the best deal by far. excellent location to everything. michigan ave. was just a few blocks and the red line was just outside the door which made it very easy to get to wrigley field. resturants galore were so easy to get to. the staff was GREAT. starbucks in the lobby was nice but only open in the morning. never made it to &quot;Webers&quot; for any meals but it did smell wonderful. the biggest complant were the sheets, they were way to small for the bed and always had to tuck them back under the mattress during the night. valet was 34.00 with in and out privileges or you can park across the street for 21.00 but with NO privileges. if you come with your kids make sure you check out the &quot;Espn zone&quot; great things to keep a kid happy and yes, great food also."
218,193,"Jun 8 2004	Wonderful stay	My wife, 12 year old son, and I stayed here May 28through June 1. The valets/bellmen at the frontdoor greeted us pleasantly as we walked up.(took the subway from the airport). Receptionwas friendly and efficient. Room was spaciousand very clean. Microwave and fridge were veryhandy since there is a great supermarket acrossthe street that is open til midnight. Starbucks1/2 block away. Nice workout room w/ smallpool. Free high-speed internet worked great.Approx. a 3-block walk over to Michigan Ave.where all the high-end stores reside. Easybus and/or subway ride to everything. We caughtBlue Man Group after a short subway ride.Loved the fresh flowers in the lobby. Highlyrecommended, especially for the price."

1,194,"Nov 15 2009 	Terrific Stay	From start to finish the staff was very friendly and willing to offer assistance. Rooms very clean. It was just my husband and I so the suite was perfect. It may be small for a larger family. Did not use the pull out couch/bed so not sure how comfortable this would be. The bed and furnishings were very nice. Bar and restaurant was expensive, other good values in the area. Walking distance to all the fine shopping and located right next to the John Hancock Building and a couple of blocks to the Towers Shopping and American Girl Store. Located just 1 block off of Michigan Ave which was perfect and only a few blocks from the Lake. Great to walk either direction from the hotel."
2,194,"Nov 6 2009 	Anyone gives this place above an average rating is crazy	What a disappointment. The ONLY thing this place has going for it is location. Don't look for anything else &quot;special&quot; about this hotel. A real disappointment.Look at the negatives in the other reviews. And consider them strongly. Very strongly. The people who wrote the negatives about this place in other reviews know EXACTLY what they are talking about.We would not consider returning to this place, even if the rate was $28/night. That's how disappointing it is. There are too many other places in the neighborhood that offer the benefits of a great location, but offer accomodations and service that are just so far superior to this one.Oh, and by the way...the beds are extremely uncomfortable. The fold out couch is a definite joke, as others have said. But the beds themselves? Awful."
3,194,"Oct 30 2009 	Best Value Biggest Room Best experience	So we've been in and out of hotel rooms for the past month after being 'in between' apartments on my part and this is the best one thus far (1. hilton, 2. doubletree LAST 3. allegro). The room is absolutely huge. 2 double doors that lead to a giant bedroom with another tv, a living room with a flat panel, big bathroom, wet bar...not to mention the ridiculously cool indoor pool on the roof...Do you know how rare that is? Doubletree advertised a roof...that was closed for the winter. And the couch folds out into a bigger bed. And theres a microwave.And its right next to the Hancock building giving us a gorgeous view (the fact that they put us on the top floor didn't hurt either). We were planning on going out and enjoying the city but got such a kick out of our room that we went to Jewel like 2 teenagers and bought $30 worth of frozen buffalo wings to eat/watch tv with all night while snuggling on our folding couch.I can't believe this was the cheapest hotel we got because this was BY FAR the best I've ever stayed in. I wish I can get the same rate again but its just not showing up. :("
4,194,"Oct 9 2009 	Lovely Hotel Perfect location!	When visiting Chicago, we love to stay on or near the Magnificent Mile for shopping, restaurants etc, This hotel is lovely, newly renovated. The rooms are clean, spacious suites with internet service. We were well cared for by staff and enjoyed the little restaurant for a quick snack or drink. Walking distance to most things or a cab ride or bus ride to all else."
5,194,"Oct 8 2009 	great location nice hotel	This hotel was booked when we arrived and they told me that our room was a handicapped room. I'm not sure why they gave us that, but we went up to it and didn't like it very much, especially the shower. So, later that afternoon we asked to switch, and they did switch us but it was to a room with two queen beds instead of one king. The room was much nicer so I'm definitely glad they could switch us.The service was not so great the whole time. We tried to go to the concierge desk two separate times and both times no one was there. We waited 10 minutes one time and eventually the bellhop helped us a little bit. This was sorely disappointing.However, the hotel was in a very good location two blocks from Michigan Avenue and, overall, the hotel was nice."
6,194,"Aug 29 2009 	Good location but amenities are pretty basic	The location was very good, close to shopping, restaurants, and sight-seeing, which was convenient. We were able to walk or take short cab rides, wherever we wanted to go. The hotel was quiet, even though fully booked, and the room was clean enough, but when we arrived, it reeked of cigarette smoke, though it was supposedly a a non-smoking room. Fortunately the windows open, and we were able to air it out. Despite being a &quot;suite&quot; it was a tight fit for our family of 5. The beds in the bedroom were comfortable, though small for 2 people (full not queen), but the pull out couch was truly atrocious--broken springs and extremely thin/worn mattress. If you can make due without it you'll be much better off. The bathroom was small but updated, however, the closet was miniscule, and had only 5 hangers, so we each got to hang up just one thing. The one dresser matched the closet in size, so we each had one tiny drawer. Needless to say, storage was a big problem. Small microwave and refrigerator in the living area, both of which functioned without problems. We didn't try the restaurant, but the kids enjoyed the pool. Again, nothing fancy. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful, and the price was reasonable, but honestly I'd be willing to pay more next time for a little more space and comfort. Oh, and it seems that this hotel is where Lufthansa flight crews stay on their layovers so the lobby was constantly full of their uniformed personnel every time we passed through the lobby--no big deal but made getting elevators a problem a few times."
7,194,"Aug 22 2009 	Not Hilton level no safe in room ridiculus breakfast touristic hotel too expansive	Very very far from Hilton level, a touristic hotel with a very very poor breakfast (22$): omelettes, pastries, waffels available as extra (12$-14$).At the same price - leveled at minimum around 200$-250$ per night (in addition 50$ for parking, while others are 35-45) - you may find others much better same block. The room is very large, is a junior suite with a plasma (but the bedroom has just an old style tv), 33channels in total, internet not free, business center not free (3 computers in total, swipe your credit card also for turning on the pc !!!), no ipod console in room, minibar in room present but empty, NO SAFE IN ROOM, no fan in bathroom with 2 doors to access it (1 for bedroom 1 for living room), single sink... Much better 1 door to the bathroom and 2 silks, or not ?Good a sink in the living room and a microwave...It is understood that this hotel was a DoubleTree before and not originally a Hilton 100%...Look deeply before choosing this hotel, same block there or 1 block far you may find 10-15 superhotel (knickerbocker, marriot...). For same price you get a 500sqf suite at knickerboker with jacuzzi fully stocked minibar 2x40&quot; plasma Frette linen and bathrobe and slippers...Very very poor for a Hilton."
8,194,"Aug 17 2009 	Lovely stay. Can't wait to return.	My girlfriends and I stayed at the Hilton Suites Magnificent Mile for 3 nights in August 2009. I requested an upgrade at the front desk and was told that we had been given one, only to discover that the room was the exact one that we had paid for. Oh, well. It was worth a shot. We had an alcove room which was clean and modern. The flat screen tv that you could swivel at any angle was a very nice touch. There is a microwave, but no refrigerator (a little strange). Our room had two double beds and a small pull out sofa. The beds are double, not queen, which was a very tight fit for two friends sharing a bed. Any request that we made was immediately taken care of. The front desk staff, maintenance, and housekeeping were all very nice and helpful. Concierge never seemed to be at the desk. We tried repeatedly but never found anyone at this post. Very annoying, since all maps and brouchures were located behind the concierge's desk. Parking was very expensive ($50 per day, valet, but you can come and go as often as you like for that price). Hotel is very close to wonderful shopping and dining. Most attractions required a short cab ride (average was about $10 including tip). I would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return. Very nice stay. Be sure to get Second City tickets while in Chicago. The show was a hightlight of this trip. Non-stop laughs."
9,194,"Aug 14 2009 	Great location lots of room.	We travelled to chicago with our two teenaged boys. This hotel was great because of the space. We had a suite with a bedroom and living room. The space was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable although it would have been nice if they had been queen size rather than full/double. Of course in Chicago you have to pay for everything, including parking ($50/night) and wireless internet. Free wifi was available in the lobby, but you had to pay for it if you wanted it in your room. We got a decent price for our room ($135/night on Expedia). The hotel was within walking distance of the Navy Pier, river cruise and the red line (train/El). All in all I would say this was a good place to stay, especially if you're travelling with kids."
10,194,"Aug 12 2009 	Return Family Great Location Good facilities a little tired	I stayed at this property for 5 nights in April 2007 with my 3 children and had a good experience. So, when we were coming to Chicago this year, it was my first choice. The rooms are big for a family of 5 (traveling with lots of luggage). We stayed 7 nights this year. The kids are 9, 8 and 5.We were meeting various family members at this property and even more family members from Chicago. The concierge was very helpful in recommending some brunch and dinner locations for a party 13. Our wait times were minimal - Thank you!We arrived after a 9 hr flight from London. From the time we arrived, the entire hotel staff was very friendly. Check-in was smooth. For the 1st 2nights we had 2 joining rooms (K suite to double alcove). This gave us lots of space to help adjust to jet leg. The rooms were clean and in good repair. For the 3-7 nights, I asked to be moved to a double suited room (my husband left on a business trip so we didn't need the extra space). The 2nd room could have used a bit of maintenance work - the ceiling was coming down in the corner due to upstairs water damage. Maintenance had to come in and fix the sofa sleeper. All the rooms were clean, but the hotel could use a bit of a maintenance update.The first morning we arrived the family was wide awake at 3a and at the pool by 5:30a - it was fantastic to let the kids wiggle without disturbing the other guests. (note - the pool is definitely a child/family pool and the whole pool area needs to be renovated).We are Gold Honors guests, so we were given the option of free internet, $6.26 off breakfast buffet (or free continental breakfast) or points. We chose the breakfast coupons. The hotel breakfast was typical hotel food - the hot food looked a little old, but the cold stuff was fresher. We ate out at 2 local diners for breakfast (as my brothers family were not Gold guests) There are several good breakfast options within a 6 block walk - the concierge has a list of local restaurants. We went to Tempo Diner and Orginal Pancake House.I found the hotel bar to be expensive for single glasses of wine and chose to buy a bottle across the street at the mini-market and kept it in the room fridge.The property is located close to shopping and North Street beach! The children had a fantastic time. The girls especially loved the proximity to the American Girl Store.There is a great steakhouse around the corner - Rosebuds Steakhouse. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the 3 children. We went there the first night in town and the children all fell asleep on the booth. We returned several nights later with 5 children and had great service/food againAs a family we would return to this proprty again."
11,194,"Aug 10 2009 	great location with a pool	The hotel property was OK. The toilet ran, no bathroom fan and no clock when we first got into our room. The staff was very helpful. The location is great. Overall a good choice if you're traveling with kids who need a pool."
12,194,"Jul 30 2009 	Great family place	We visit Chicago frequently, but this was our first stay at the Hilton. The rooms were large and clean, and the location is terrific. There is a small fridge, a microwave, and coffeemaker. The beds were very comfortable, and having a separate bedroom was great. The bathroom was also large, clean and stocked with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products. The pool was also lovely, with warm water and a great view of the lake. The restaurant was very good, but a little pricey, even for Chicago. All of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. For the $50 parking fee, you get in and out privledges, but there is a lot closeby for $35/dayand another two blocks south on Delaware for $28/day."
13,194,Jul 26 2009 	Great Hotel and Wonderful Staff	I stayed only one night at this wonderful hotel. From the first moment of my arrival I felt welcomed by the doorman and reception desk. Room was large and immaculate loved it! The lady at the snack bar downstairs was wonderful and helpful and made me feel a stranger no more. Even my mini horse Traveller aka The Traveling Man would approve and give 4 hoofs up!
14,194,"Jul 23 2009 	Good location - horrible couch bed!!	The location of this hotel was great - one block from Water Tower Place - decent walk to Navy Pier, etc. I didn't think the front desk did a very good job - we were checking in to a room that a friend had reserved with reward points...since he wasn't getting in until later, he called ahead to clear us getting there first, and FAXed all the information they requested. We still had a problem checking in, and they never bothered to look for the FAX, The rooms are a decent size since you have a living area and a bedroom, but the sofa bed was disgusting and broken. Unfortunately, we didn't discover this until we pulled out the bed for the night and my son sat on the corner and fell right through! There were no springs on the left side, nothing was even attached to the frame. The extra blanket in the closet was also disgusting with black oil stains all over it. Never received room service the second day because they showed up at 5 PM when we were resting from a day out."
15,194,"Jul 14 2009 	Great location wonderful rooms	Had a great stay at the Hilton Suites. Wonderful large rooms. Had breakfast and dinner at the resturant which was excellent. The pool also looked nice, was filled with kids and families."
16,194,"Jul 7 2009 	A great experience!	A very pleasant stay for two nights, July 3rd and the 4th. We were able to close our bedroom door so I never heard the usual hall noise of every other hotel I have stayed at in my life. The check in person was very helpful!!! The rest of the staff were okay."
17,194,"Jul 3 2009 	There are better hotels for the same price	We drove right by it first time because they have a E. Delaware St. address, but the entrance is actually on another street around the corner. When we reserved, we were promised an early check-in, but when we arrived, we were told we'd have to wait till 3, the normal time. Front desk staff wasn't friendly at all. Suite was nice, but not exceptional. Desk chair was extremely uncomfortable and the high-speed internet (extra fee) didn't work much of the time. Room cleaning didn't arrive until late afternoon.The restaurant is probably operated independently, but dinner at Cafe Med was an ordeal requiring extreme patience. Dessert alone took over 1/2 hour because the &quot;manager&quot; who was waiting on us, spent his time talking to diners familiar to him and was offended when we requested slightly quicker service. We were ignored for long periods of time. Unless you're a regular, find another place for dinner.I would not stay here again. There are better places for the same money."
18,194,"Jun 26 2009 	Not worth it; Can find better Chicago hotels	This hotel is okay, but not worth the amount you pay (even for downtown Chicago). It appears old, run-down, and out-dated inside. The rooms also seem old and are *very* small (again, even for downtown Chicago). None of the staff are very friendly. We also listened to housekeeping staff being extremely loud, laughing and talking about personal matters every morning in our hallway. Very unprofessional. Most Chicago hotels are better than this one."
19,194,"Jun 26 2009 	Pretty Good	Nice hotel, good location, view from the 4th floor wasn't up to much but we were on a freebie so didn't complain. Room was large and clean and bed comfortable. Woman behind the desk wasn't that friendly or competent. It took a while to check in and i had to come back down as the key card didn't work first time."
20,194,"Jun 20 2009 	Awesome	I booked this hotel on priceline and paid only $88. We stayed on a Sunday night. Upon arrival you learn that there is no private parking, only valey and it is 50 dollars a night. THey were super friendly though. HOtel was gorgeous. had to wait an hour to check in, as we were there an hour early. SPent that hour at the pool which was ok, it was on the 30th floor so that was cool. there was a sauna...once we got in our rooms, my jaw dropped...so NICE! bed was super comfy! the location was great though, walked home from the bars on rush, shopping on michigan avenue i mean super great location. check out was nice and they even held our bags for us after we were checked out so we could walk around a little more to do some shopping. Overall awesome!"
21,194,"Jun 18 2009 	No doutb..first choice for me	Nice, clean, spacious, luxurious. Hope to move on one day to one of this rooms.I really loved to stay here and will stay every time i have a conference here.Good location to the shopping malls and great view across. The overall service was perfect and the price was great as we booked through the net. I will recommend you every person who is coming by...RegardsPaul"
22,194,Jun 7 2009 	Would stay here again in a minute	The staff was all very friendly (even with the small kids) and knowledgable about local attractions. Rooms were nice and requests (for a high floor) were honored. Definately would recommend to others as a fine place to stay in Chicago.
23,194,"May 29 2009 	Fun Hotel in the Middle of It All	My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Suites on the latter part of our Chicago honeymoon. We checked in on a Sunday after a mile walk from our previous hotel on the river. Walking in was impressive. I did not realize when I booked on Priceline how great the location was. The block that the hotel was on is in a little quieter neighborhood, but so close to Michigan Avenue and everything else.One thing I want to emphasize is USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET HERE. I have heard that parking is outrageously priced, and thankfully we had a limo drive us in, and we are taking the train to our car in the suburbs--much more economical.The lobby is beautiful. We were kindly greeted by the staff, who promptly and politely gave us our room keys, and up the elevators we went. The elevators are efficient and quick, and there seems to always have been an elevator waiting in the lobby. The pool and workout room on the 30th floor are a nice side attraction, especially if a guest were to have kids.When we came to our room at first, however, we found it to still be occupied at 2:00p!!! How embarrassing! Apparently, they had not checked out when they were supposed to, but still--I think there should have been better communication between the cleaning maids and the front desk on that one. The issue was quickly resolved, and we were given a new room.It kind of stinks that you have to pay for internet (which I refused, since there was a weak network I could connect to from elsewhere). Other than that, our room was kept clean, there were always friendly greeters at the front, and we had an overall comfortable stay in a beautiful city."
24,194,"May 19 2009 	A Great Location	This all suites hotel is on East Delaware Street just across from the John Hancock tower. You are close to great shopping on the 900 block of Michigan Avenue. The cheesecake factory, the museum of contemporary art &amp; the double decker trolley route are all close by. I was able to get it for $55/night on priceline! Parking was another $50 for in/out privelages. Cheaper lots across the way at the Hancock."
25,194,"Apr 19 2009 	Great location value and rooms	I would stay here again, this hotel was great. we booked the room for $76 on Priceline (3.5 stars)...blew away our expectations"
26,194,"Apr 14 2009 	Luvly Jubly!	Great stay! My wife and 2 teenage kids were heading back home from Cleveland to Milwaukee and decided to spend a couple days in Chicago for some sightseeing. This was a great location right at the North end of Michigan Ave with a great rate. All the hotels in the area have to charge alot for parking but we parked in a garage right around the corner for 35.00 for a 24 hour period - better than the 50.00 the hotel would've charged. Also be aware that many hotels with indoor pools like this one will charge for &quot;athletic club fees&quot; or something along these lines. This hotel's pool, sauna, whirlpool, and machines are included in the very affordable price. American Doll store is within 3 blocks and all the shops are right at your doorstep. Took a bus to Lincoln Park Zoo (free) and walked to the south end of michigan Ave and took a free shuttle bus to Navy Pier. In the evening, I walked 4 blocks to Rush St. for Live Jazz and drinks while the 3 girls watched a movie and went to bed. Can't beat it!"
27,194,"Mar 16 2009 	Great bang for your buck right in the heart of Magnificent Mile	Stayed 2 nights for business, the location is great, its right off Michigan behind the John Hancock Tower and Water Tower Shops. Big suite, flat screen TV (that wasn't as clear as it should be), sofa/bed in living room, nice sized bathroom (drain was rather slow to clear in the shower but otherwise fine). Overall given the low rate I got it was a tremendous value. Nice rooftop indoor pool/health center too. Would suggest going around the corner to The Saloon Steakhouse for dinner, its a gem! My biggest complaint with Hilton is they charge $12.95/day for in room internet access (yet their Hampton Inn brand gives it to you free), come on Hilton at least give your HHonors members a break!"
28,194,"Mar 12 2009 	$75 from Priceline but $50 for parking!!	Does this seem a little strange? Room was very nice and the $75 winning bid on Priceline was reasonable, but I have never paid $50 for parking and I stay at various hotels in downtown Chicago often."
29,194,"Feb 25 2009 	Great Rooms	the room we had was great--a separate living area and a separate bedroom. very comfortable bed. frigde and microwave included in &quot;suite&quot;. location was on the magnificant mile so close to shopping. nothing special about the attendants at the front desk--no welcomes or smiles, they just check you in quickly. internet is not free in the room but it is when you're in the lobby. the worst part about this place is the parking--it cost $50 per night to valet park, no self parking available. we did manage to park at a parking structure 5minutes away for $23 dollars (for a 12hour period, although the sign said $28 for 24hours). we got a really good deal for the hotel on priceline.com (&lt;$100 a night)."
30,194,"Feb 24 2009 	Great location beautiful views - highly recommend!	We stayed here for one night at the end of a week-long business trip to Central Illinois. The room rate was cheaper than near the airport, so we thought we'd have some fun our last night. And the Hilton Suites didn't disappoint!The staff was wonderful - starting with the valet attendants. (Yes, parking is $50, but it's that much everywhere in Chicago or most major cities.) The front desk staff was most helpful and freindly. The suite was on the 26th floor and had a nice view of Lake Michigan. There was an LCD TV in the living room area and an older TV in the bedroom. The rooms have been recently updated, as everything was nice and new.The pool and exercise room are on the top floor (30th) with a gorgeous view.The restaurant was great for breakfast. The continental breakfast for Diamond members was rather sparse, but we could apply the voucher towards a full breakfast, which was delicious.The location is great. We parked the car and didn't need it again. It's a one block walk to Michigan Avenue with lots of shops and restaurants right there.This is a great place to stay in the Magnificent Mile at a reasonable price."
31,194,"Jan 23 2009 	Absolutely loved it	First time staying at the Hilton - have stayed at several others in Chicago.From the moment we arrived and were met by a smile and welcome from the desk. The suites are more than adequate with microwave and fridge and coffee machine. The beds are really comfortable, and there is a normal TV in the bedroom with a large flat screen in the living area. Bathroom was larger than average with very hot water at any time of day and excellent pressure to the shower. An abundance of towels is always available.The swimming pool / hot tub and sauna are located on the 30th floor together with the fitness room with amazing views over the lake. There are always cabs outside waiting to take you wherever but the hotel is only one block from the shops and Michigan Avenue so ideally located for shopping etc and right behind the Hancock."
32,194,"Jan 19 2009 	Great surprise	Haven't stayed here since it was the Doubletree a couple years ago. It was a little shabby then, but I was very pleased with the room. Totally redone 2 room suite. Two plasma TV's microwave, small fridge. (Although I don't know why they put the microwave under the cabinet and way down low). Coffee maker with Lavazza coffee. Great workout room on the top floor with indoor pool, spa and great views. Very close to water Tower and Mag Mile."
33,194,"Nov 6 2008 	Good location and service	Stayed for 5 nights while attending a conference. The hotel is well located for the Magnificent Mile, just around the corner from the Millenium Knickerbocker, Westin and Drake hotels.The hotel is clean, the lobby is spacious with free WiFi. The pool is up on the higher floors with a view of the Lake.The room was good, though not amazing. The bedding and linen, though, was fantastic. The suites are spacious, and you can split the room into two, and use the sofa bed as an alternative bed i sharing with non-spouse (we were in a two doubles room). The bathroom is reasonable, with a good amount of towels. There is a small sink and coffee machine in the lounge area, which is helpful. WiFi and wired internet in the rooms costs money.Staff were excellent, and very helpful.Note that the Magnificent Mile is good for some things, but it's not quite the busy night bustle of downtown, so you might find that you trek down there every day. Food specifically was a concern, with mainly high-end restaurants near the hotel. It was a good walk to the nearest cheap food joint.Overall, happy with the stay."
34,194,"Sep 18 2008 	Fantastic Hotel! Amazing Experience!	I had a terrible flight before I got to the property so I was very grouchy! When I arrived there was a very nice gentleman there to open the door for me with a big smile. I feel smile's change everything. When I got to the front desk there was a bit of a line and I was already tired so it made me a little grumpy but that is just how it goes. When I got to the desk, the young lady was very very nice she welcomed me to the property with another smile. The suite was very nice for the price. It has a flat screen tv in the living room and and a regular television in the bedroom. The beds are very comfortable. So my day was going a little better, I have had some very bad hotel stay's so I was happy so far. When I opened my suitcase I realised I had forgotten my toiletries. I called down to the front desk and they had replacements sent up with in 10 minutes. During my stay everyone was very helpful and cheerful, really living up to the hilton standard. When checking out there where a few things on my bill that where incorrect but the gentleman at the desk had no problem taking care of them for me. He asked me how my stay was and was sure to welcome me back. I am going to recommend this hotel to all of my friends visiting Chicago."
35,194,"Aug 30 2008 	Great place to stay	Stayed here for 2 weeks and had a great time. Rooms are spacious, air-con kept rooms nice n'cool and beds were excellent. Great location and we found all the staff very helpful. Only minor gripe was housekeeping waking us up for something we didn't request. Note only rooms with single king are on lake side, we have 2 doubles which meant city side. We didn't have breakfast there and instead went to Tempo (UK tourist note food good but doesn't take cards so dollars go quickly), Corner bakery (Cedar and State) excellent food/value or LAppetitto (Hancock building). Given length of stay we found hotel to be excellent and would definitely stay again."
36,194,"Aug 27 2008 	Not The Best If You Expect Service	This hotel has nicely renovated suites but that's where the good news ends. We are Hilton Honor members but that means nothing to the management here. If you think you can check in at the stated check-in time at 3:00, don't get your hopes up. We couldn't check in until 4:30, but had to check out on- time the next day. I asked if they would compensate us for that somehow (maybe a free drink or breakfast), I was answered with an indifferent &quot;No, we don't do that!&quot;I requested extra towels but never got them. There wasn't any extra toilet paper in the room. We asked the concierge where was a good place to eat and she snapped, &quot;Everything is booked until 10:00.&quot; She eventually got us a reservation but it was grudging. Odd job for someone with this temperament. We travel frequently and this is the first time I have been motivated to write this kind of review. Luckily, most of our travel experiences have been positive."
37,194,"Jul 31 2008 	All show and no substance	The room is decent and reasonably comfortable. That is about all the complementary statements I can make. Expect no service, because you will get what you expect. When they say check in is at 3 pm, don't expect it a minute early. Don't store your bags with the bellman because you never know when you will see them again.Don't ask for turn down service because that won't happen and don't ask for any special compensation because that won't happen.If you need a room and nothing else this hotel is acceptable. Otherwise stay elsewhere."
38,194,"Jul 16 2008	Great location horrible service	We booked a weekend at the Hilton Suites for a girls' weekend getaway, and had many, many issues with poor service at this location. Our rooms were given away with little explanation or apology, and we were offered sub-standard rooms only. On Saturday, we were promised a move to our originally reserved rooms by 3 p.m., which did not happen. The entire time, the front desk staff was incredibly grouchy and did not apologize or attempt to make amends. We had other issues with our bill and key cards. The hotel itself is nice, as long as you don't interact with anyone who works there! I will never stay at this hotel again, as there are a plethora of other options nearby, namely a Residence Inn across the street."
39,194,"Jul 7 2008	Beware The Alcove	In January, I booked two rooms (one for us and one for relatives with two small children) at this hotel for the long July 4th weekend. In booking, the toll free number reservation clerk asked if I wanted the alcove suite. I asked what it was. She stated that the alcove suite was in the corner, configured differently (like an L so the bedroom was still separate) but the price was the same as for the regular suite. I said yes and booked two alcoves on different floors (both room numbers ended in 02). Then I arrived at one of the busiest weekends of the Chicago year where the room you booked was the room you got.Beware - contrary to the website - the alcove is not a suite. It does not have a separate bedroom - it is one big square room. It does not have two TVs. It does not have a mini-refrigerator for the soda, water and left-over cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. It does not have a microwave to heat up leftover Ginos pizza. It has one small coffee maker and thats it. The advertising from Hilton (on its website) on this type of room is totally misleading. I did not mind the lack of a separate bedroom as much as the fact that it didnt have a mini-frig or microwave. The fact that it doesnt have a separate bedroom, mini-frig, microwave, etc. should be accurately advertised by Hilton on its website because it matters to some people  especially those with children. I also dont see how or why Hilton charges the same per night for an alcove room as it does for a true suite.The room itself was comfortable, I had a sideways view of the lake and the two kids absolutely loved the pool but I am surprised at, and disappointed in, the Hilton, which is a quality company, to advertise the alcove as something it was not."
40,194,"Jun 21 2008 	Simply Delightful. Enough Said.	From top to bottom, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was attentive, efficient and friendly. Our room was absolutely lovely ... better than expected. We only had a short stay, and would have loved to have extended it, but unfortunately we did not pack accordingly.The room had a comfortable sitting area with a desk facing Oak Street Beach, a flat screen TV, and a convenient wet bar, microwave and mini refrigerator (all nicely concealed in beautiful cabinets.)The bathroom was quite spacious and tastefully decorated. It was accessible from both the sitting area and the master bedroom. Between the master bedroom and bathroom was a nice vanity area.The master bedroom was also tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed and a view of the lake. The bedding was top notch and what you would expect of nicer hotels. The hotel was very quiet, so you could really get a good nights sleep.We took advantage of the complimentary breakfest and was pleasantly surprised at the wide offerings, the helpful staff, and the views of city life bustling outside the window. They also had an outdoor cafe.All in all, if you're popping into the city for a short stay or long, I think you'll enjoy the staff, accommodations and locations of this gem. A great value for the money."
41,194,"Jun 8 2008 	A New Favorite Place to Stay	Our family travels to Chicago once or twice every year and we have stayed at various properties throughout the city and suburbs. Some have been so-so while others have been great. Our most recent stay over Memorial Day weekend was at the Hilton Suites MM. Our experience here was terrific and very family friendly. This hotel had an amazing location--an easy walk or catch a short cab ride to everything (the Watertower Shopping Mall is about a block away)! The suite was generous in size--the bathroom was one of the biggest I've seen in a standard room--and it was very clean. The beds were also quite comfortable. The first morning, we went to the restaurant in the hotel, Mrs. Parks Tavern, and were pleasantly surprised how good the food was. We returned for breakfast two day later! The staff was also very friendly and helpful. It was one of our best visits to Chicago and I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
42,194,"May 28 2008 	Good but...	I do agree with other reviews about the location of this hotel.. perfect for doing all the things Chicago requires. We visit Chicago often (every other month) and stay wherever the rooms are the least expensive. Needless to say, we have stay at a few! This Hilton is one that I would stay in again and again. However, all was not perfect. The hotel was hot! And I don't mean the Paris way!!! It was hot. The workout facilities were far too warm. Good equipment but hot! Even the room was hot. The HVAC is the one thing in our room that was not updated. Probably an expensive undertaking but still. This is a Hilton. I had the windows open all night to keep it cool and it did not really help. At least I had a beautiful view of the lake over the rooftops. Everything else was good. Try it. I liked it but NOT in the summer when heat is not what you want."
43,194,"Apr 4 2008 	Very nice	This hotel has a great location in Streeterville, right next to the John Hancock tower--if you want to see Chicago's main attractions without renting a car this is a good spot. We had a lake view suite and with our AAA rate it was a good buy, the suite really felt like a small apartment with a great bed, flat screen tv in the living room/den. The hotel restaurant was nice, the only complaint would be that the bar had no draft beer for the entire weekend we were there--they seemed to indicate that it would be fixed any time but it didn't seem to be much of a priority.Overall, very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
44,194,"Mar 7 2008	A Wicked time in Chicago	We had a great time at the Hilton Suites Chicago. When we arrived I was able to check in and get my room keys from the check-in machine in the lobby, which saved us a lot of time since there was a line at the Hilton Hhonors desk. We were in our room in a flash and ready to settle in.The first thing I noticed when we walked in the room was the nice living area of the suite. There was a wet bar in one corner, along with a desk, a couch and a flat screen TV. You could access the bathroom and the bedroom from the living area. There were three in our party: my sister in law, my seven year old daughter and myself. My daughter loved the flat screen TV, and it wasn't long before she found the Cartoon Network!The bedroom area of the suite was really small. There was just enough room to walk around the beds. There was also a door from the bedroom to the bathroom. Having the dual access to the bath was nice. We didn't have to plow through our mess in the bedroom to get there! There was also a TV in the bedroom.The bathroom was also tiny. With 2 1/2 women trying to get ready it got a little crowded. I ended up setting my compact mirror on the desk in the living area so my SIL could get in the bathroom to shower. A vanity separate from the bath would've been nice.Our service was, for the most part, stellar. All of the employees were friendly and cheerful. The concierge was helpful, but not exceptionally friendly, but all of the people we spoke to at the front desk were great. We didn't try the restaurant, but were able to redeem our free breakfast coupons in the little coffee shop in the hotel. You gotta love Krispy Kreme doughnuts!The only glitch we ran into was on our last night there. It was a Saturday night, and my daughter wanted to hit the pool. The pool was to close in 30 minutes, but I thought we could get in a quick dip. When we got in the elevator, it wouldn't go to the floor where the pool was. I called the front desk, and they assured me that my key card should work, and to just try again. We tried again, to no avail. I called the front desk again, only to be informed that the pool had closed for the night. I was a little peeved because it was supposed to be open another 30 minutes, but there wasn't much we could do about it.Overall we had a great stay. The bellmen were great and very helpful. The hotel was convenient to Michigan Avenue and there was a bus stop just down the street about a block. I would definitely stay here again."
45,194,"Feb 13 2008 	Great Hotel. Great Location. Great staff.	First of all, you cant beat the location. It's in the perfect spot on the Magnificent Mile and very close the lake. John Hancock tower is across the street and worth a visit. The hotel is on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle which made it feel more like a local boutique hotel rather than a busy and noisy mega-hotel. The front desk staff was overly helpful and when I told the clerk I was craving clam chowder he proceeded to call all the local restaurants until he found one serving clam chowder! I was impressed.The rooms are top notch and super clean. Maid service was superb and the common areas were all very clean and nicely appointed. I loved the top floor pool with the breathtaking view of the lake. One person complained about the trash can being in the wrong place and said they wouldn't recommend the hotel...well I think that says it all when all you can find wrong with this hotel is a mis located trash can. It's a great place to stay....period."
46,194,"Jan 26 2008 	Good place to stay	Nice hotel. Used to be doubletree suites. Just south of Drake hotel. Remodeled property... much better place than as a doubletree.&quot;01&quot; rooms on every floor are in quiet location and have partial view of lake.great pool on top of hotel, decent fitness rooms(could use more weight equipment).Only negative(as this was January) was there is a cold draft in that hotel. air comes in the window crevices (windows are floor to ceiling). Food in restuarnt only fair. Would stay again..."
47,194,"Jan 19 2008	I always love to come back!	I often stay at the Hilton suites.The only negative thing is that its Hilton suites, before the renovation it was a Doubletree hotel and now you get no more cookies!Location:Just 3 minutes away from Michigan Avenue. The Hancok Center ist just around the corner.Staff:The staff is always helpfull and friendly. Rooms:Newly renovated. The beds are very comfortable. There is a seperate Living room. There are 2 tv`s and one of them is a flat-screen. Everything is brand new. The bath is big and very nice decorated.Overall beautiful clean and comfortable rooms and what I love: The windows can be opened!There is a snack bar in the lobby where they brew Starbucks.The fitness room is small but the view from there is fantastic.Cant tell the price cause my company pays.A great place to stay for vacation or business!"
48,194,"Jan 15 2008 	Was better as a Doubletree	We stayed here when it was a Doubletree in 2005 and it was so much better. This time the round table and 4 chairs were missing! However, the living/dining area is the same size, so there is a quite large area that is just empty. There is a couch to sit on, as there was when it was a Doubletree, but if more than one person wants to eat or write or just sit at a table, forget about it. There is only a desk that seats one person. The metal waste basket in the bathroom made a perfectly HUGE bang in the middle of the night when you walked into it because there is no place under the vanity for this bin made out of a ridiculous material. There is no shaving or make up mirror of any kind with decent light. Tea, coffee and a percolator are provided, but if you want to add sugar and/or milk and stir it, you'll have to use your finger or something else since no stirrers or spoons are provided. The pull-out couch has a bar that perfectly pierces your back. All in all a pretty terrible experience. Next time I will check out the Marriott across the street."
49,194,"Jan 11 2008 	Excellent Option in the Magnificent Mile area	Stayed for one night at the Hilton Suites, located adjacent to the John Hancock building and just one block off the Magnificant Mile. Perfect location for doing business or entertaining in Chicago.The lobby is not grand but has a small coffee shop and bar / restaurant out front. Did not eat at either place but they looked decent. There is also a small convenience store right across the street if you are looking for some quick snacks. The entire hotel looks brand new and is extremely clean and polished. The staff seems to work hard to keep it up.The rooms are fabulous. Two room suites with a living room &amp; bedroom and large bathroom. Again, the rooms look brand new, were perfectly clean, the bed was comfortable (typical Hilton) and all the amenties you would need. There is an HD TV in the living room area but I could not find any HD channels. Maybe that is coming.Plenty of good restaurants in the area. We ate at Mike Ditka's restaurant (and he actually came in and ate a few tables from us) and the food &amp; atmosphere was great. We had drinks on the 96th floor of the John Hancock building - which on a clear night is spectacular. Overall, this is an excellent choice for the Magnificient Mile area of Chicago."
50,194,"Jan 9 2008	great place	Location was terrific, rooms were just fine and the staff was more than accomadating (especially during the crazy New Year's Eve). Really liked the fact that across the street is a mini-mart - able to stock the fridge and grab snacks easily, as well as the coffee bar downstairs in the lobby that served up great &quot;Starbucks quality&quot; lattes. This is a perfect place to &quot;hang your hat&quot; for the day as you spend the days visiting many of Chicago's wonderful sites."
51,194,"Dec 19 2007 	Great hotel	We booked this hotel for a girl's week-end get away and wanted something close to all the shops,food,sights. We arrived earlier than check-in time and found a room was ready. The staff was very polite. Our room was perfect. Plenty of room for 5 of us to sprawl our bags and stuff. The rooms have a mini fridge and microwave and wet bar as well as 2 tv's and a decent sized bathroom. No noise on our floor (14th). Actually we never saw anyone our short stay there. Close to John Hancock and Water Tower place. Cabs are ready waiting for you if you need one. Would definitely stay again. We didn't try the restaraunt but did have Starbucks coffee from the little shop in the lobby."
52,194,"Oct 28 2007 	Measure Those Beds and Fix the Air Conditioning!	My husband and I booked a room at the Hilton Suites based on the Tripadvsior reviews. Supposedly all the rooms have a king-size bed, but when we arrived, we could see immediately that the bed in our room was NOT a king by any stretch. We called the front desk to make sure that they had indeed booked us for a king size bed, and were told that yes, that ALL of their beds were king-size. We knew that this bed was not king sized, and we were not about to stay in the tiny little bed, so we asked for the manger on duty. The manger accompanied us to see another room, and when she returned to our room, she realized that the bed in our room was indeed smaller. She did move us to the other room, but it was a pain to repack and lug our belongings to the new floor. We wondered how many other rooms were being advertised as having a king size bed that instead had one like the one in our first room. The manger did give us breakfast coupons, which was very nice of her, but it does not change the fact that if you ask for a king size bed, you might get stuck instead with one of the small ones ( looked like a double) Be sure to ask about this if you call for a reservation. And, check it out once you get into the room. There were a few other problems as well--the air conditioner did not work, and the room was as hot as hades during the night. Bathroom bulb was burned out and not replaced during our stay even though we left a note for housekeeping. The pool is very nice- although a bit small. It was warm and enjoyable for swimming. Because of its small size though, the number of children in there with their parents made it difficult to manuever and stay out of the way. All in all, we found this place just OK. We've been to Chicago many times and we were looking for a new adventure. We'll not come back here again."
53,194,"Oct 6 2007	Great place to stay in Chicago!	Stayed here for a work conference. Beautiful suite with a king bed, roomy bathroom, separate make-up area and a living area with sofa bed, micro, fridge, etc. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as there was an error in my reservation. (Work's fault, not the hotel)Ordered room service and the cheese plate was great and the service was very friendly. Checked my bags after checkout, so I could sightsee a bit and bell staff were quick to retrieve my bag later and hail me cab. Great location next to the John Hancock building and close to Water Tower Place. (Eat at the Food Life food court there and get your nails done in the John Hancock building.)Would stay again!"
54,194,"Oct 3 2007 	clean room -- great location	You will find our family of 5 usually staying here for a few days every June. It is in a convenient location for both business and leisure travel as it sits a block from the Hancock Tower with easy access via a not-yet-crowded bus to the convention center. The indoor pool (which my kids love) on the top floor seems to be some sort of secret because hardly anybody is ever there. The room is not 5-star luxury but is very clean, spacious and comfortable. One minor downside, there is no executive lounge which is common in most Hilton hotels. All in all, we enjoy our stay every time we are in chicago."
55,194,"Sep 9 2007	Comfortable convenient	I really liked this hotel. Our room was nicely sized and comfortable, which is exactly what we needed since we were traveling with a small child. Plus we had a great view! The location was quite good though in the winter, that extra block you need to walk down from the Magnificent Mile is brutal! Still, it was definitely convenient. Overall, a great room for a very reasonable price."
56,194,"Sep 5 2007 	minor problems decent deal for a discount price	The Hilton Suites is in a great location, just a block off Michigan Ave and very close to popular tourist spots like Water Tower, the Hancock building and North Beach.The hotel was extremely busy and crowded when we arrived. It was Labor Day weekend, and I believe there was also a wedding going on at the hotel, so this didn't surprise me. I think, however, they could have done a better job preparing for the crowd. We arrived in a cab with a lot of luggage and were unable to get a bellhop or any hotel employee to help us with our bags or even hold the door open for us as we carried them in. We struggled to get all our luggage past the crowd of people on the sidewalk in front of the door and in the lobby and then had to wait almost 10 minutes in line at the front desk. Some other frustrated people tried to use the automated check-in instead of waiting in line, but it wasn't working properly. Not the best first impression.We finally got to the front of the line, and the staff member who checked us in was friendly and helpful. We were initially given a smoking room (not the hotel's mistake) and were quickly moved to a non-smoking room when we asked. Unfortunately, the room they put us in had no lights in the bathroom. Both light bulbs over the sink had burned out. When I called the front desk about this, I was told that they were out of stock of those light bulbs and wouldn't get any in until the following week. I was a little upset about this, especially since it seemed that the staff member was basically telling me there was nothing they could do about it. I asked if we could be moved to another room that had lights in the bathroom, and he said he would have a manager call me back.A manager never called, but they did send someone up to bring us one lightbulb, which was apparently taken from the bathroom of some other room. So at least we had some light in the bathroom...but it seemed a little ridiculous that they weren't prepared for something like that when they knew they would have a full house for Labor Day.We had no other problems during our stay. It was very quiet at night. The rooms were clean and reasonably spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was generally pleasant and helpful. As I said before, the location was great. The fact that all the rooms are suites is also a bonus if you need an extra bed. I also liked that the room had a separate vanity (which I had to use for getting ready in the morning since we had very dim bathroom lighting), a microwave and little refrigerator. There is also a coffee shop and a restaurant (open all day) in the lobby of the hotel, and the stay includes free use of their pool and fitness center. Having one burned-out light bulb in the bathroom for the duration of our stay seemed to be a minor issue, especially since I got an excellent rate on the hotel room for Labor Day weekend as part of a group rate for a wedding. If, however, I had had to pay the regular price for the hotel room, I think I would have felt a little ripped off. You don't expect something like that from a hotel like this.In sum, the service was ok, the place was clean, comfortable and in a great location, and it was just fine for a discounted price ($160/night). If this is one of the cheaper options you can find to fit your other needs (location, # of beds in a room, etc.), it is a decent deal."
57,194,"Aug 25 2007 	Simply the Best in Chicago!	I can't say enough great things about this hotel. I travel to Chicago about six times per year on business and stay at a number of different properties and the Hilton Suites is hands down my favorite. I had stayed at the hotel three years ago when it was still a Doubletree and was very impressed with every aspect of the hotel from the exceptional quality of the rooms, beautiful decor, outstanding service, ideal location and fantastic views. Most recently I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel in August and was equally as impressed with the hotel today as I was during my first visit three years ago. Although the room furnishings and interior decor have been modified tastefully the hotel retains all of its excellence. There is no shortage of great hotels in Chicago and Hilton Suites is at the top of my list. I highly recommend this property."
58,194,"Aug 24 2007 	Typically wonderful Hilton welcome	My husband and I spent a weekend in Chicago to celebrate our birthdays, which are less than a month apart. We planned to use public transport to get around, so this hotel's central location just behind Water Tower Place was great. It's only a few blocks from the nearest subway stop (worth the walk even in the near-zero temperatures we encountered), and buses run up and down the Mag Mile all the time. Hilton Suites are the best of both worlds - the facilities of a proper hotel and the amenities of the type of place that usually caters to business travelers. For instance, a Hilton Garden Inn will have a fridge and microwave, while a Hilton hotel won't, but Hilton Suites have not only a fridge, microwave, and little sink, they also have the sitting area completely separated from the bedroom. Even if you plan to spend a lot of time out sightseeing, it's always nice to come back and plop down on your sofa in front of your flat-screen TV and pull a cold soda or bottle of water out of the fridge and relax.Then there's the service. I have found that front desk people at Hiltons are frequently more friendly and helpful than at the other major chains I use. The guy who checked us in was an absolute sweetheart, more helpful with tourist hints than the concierge was, and really interested in the success of our stay. When we mentioned that that day was my husband's birthday, Front Desk Guy paid attention - we got back from Second City that night to find a happy-birthday note and delicious carrot cake waiting in our room.The room was spacious and clean, the neighborhood was interesting (shopping, museums) and safe, and the rate was decent for the middle of a major city. We'd go back in a heartbeat."
59,194,"Aug 24 2007	Great location good price	Great location, nice room layout, we do not want super luxury, but do want the basic services and these were excellent. Well thought out room and although the bathroom has only one sink, there is another small sink at the bar which suffices when the need arises. Since there are several large hotels in the immediate area there are plenty of cabs, and there are many bus routes on Michigan Avenue a block away."
60,194,"Aug 24 2007	Good quiet location in Downtown Chicago	I guess my problem is I'm always comparing the hotel I stay in with others I could have stayed in at the same price in the area. Hilton Suites on a quieter street by the Hancock Building, so you can walk across the street to it if you want; depends on why you're in Chicago, I guess. The woman who checked us in was very nice and ensured that we would have a connecting room with my parents arriving the next day. We were traveling with our kids 7, 8 and 10 and had a 2 double beds/suite for four nights. The hotel was very busy. The bell woman who helped us up with our luggage was the best, most informative we have had in a long time. She explained there is a convenient store across the street (huge and reasonably priced btw with large wine selection) and other info. Very easy to get a cab. Always one in front of the hotel. Walkable to most shops on Michigan Ave. Rooms were newly updated but had a really strong smell, possibly carpet glue. I was told all rooms smelled like that, but it gave me a really bad headache and I bought travel candles to light when we were in the room. Rooms not huge. Very similar size to Residence Inn &quot;suites&quot;. Liked that the bathrooom had an entrance both from the living area and the bedroom. Bedroom small, but very comfortable beds. No problem with cable tv reception others mentioned. We are Hilton Gold members so I thought we might get an upgrade, free internet, but no. Got two vouchers for $6.50 off breakfast and that was it. Had to use the business center to print boarding passes and the usage fee plus copy fee ran me $24. Thought that was stiff for a Hilton Suites. Breakfast was not super and service in the restaurant that gets good food reviews was rather rude at breakfast. Food was just ok, but a good kids' menu. Bar staff was very friendly at night. Overall, the small size for a suite room and the really strong room odor made me rate this lower. Really between a 3 and 4. Pull-out bed not comfortable for kids, but what pull-out bed is? I always leave a tip for housekeeping and still bathroom soaps/shampoos (La Source/Crabtree Evelyn products) were not replaced even though they were used and trash cans not emptied. Could have stayed at Hilton sister hotel, the Conrad for the same price and think I would next time if traveling with family. Guess it is about price paid and at almost $300/nt not exactly worth it. If we paid less.... There is a small coffee bar in the lobby that sells Starbucks coffee and Krispy Creme donuts and cereal if you want to skip the restaurant. The plans for a full-blown Starbucks on site, we were told had been canceled."
61,194,"Aug 16 2007	Great Hotel! Even Better Staff!	Overall great service but had a rocky start. Stayed the 10-13 AUG they had a very large group with a late 4pm check out and a sold out hotel for the same evening. This included 2 motor coaches which showed up on time @ 3:00 pm and the rooms werent ready, Its a small lobby and chaos ensued. It all got resolved around 6:00 pm. Nicolette and Abraham rose to the occasion and were grace under pressure, hats off to them. The rooms are nice and well appointed. Heads up there is not a safe in the room, they are scheduled for next year. Can't beat the location!"
62,194,"Aug 5 2007 	Loved it...again	I just returned from a business trip to Chicago, and an overnight stay at the Hilton Suites Chicago/Magnificent Mile. This was my second time at this hotel -- the first was exactly a year ago soon after it was converted from a Doubletree to a Hilton.This is a very good hotel for the business traveler. I loved the separate bedroom and work areas. The work space was ample, and a second table was on casters below the main desk, providing more work area as needed. My only negative -- and this seems to be a common one -- is that there was no safe in the room, or at least I couldn't find it.The main living space also had a small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee/tea maker. The bathroom was a good size, and could be entered from either the bedroom or living room. The king-sized bed was very comfortable, and I slept well. I was assigned a room directly across from the elevators (last two digits are 04) and was, therefore, concerned about noise, but once I closed the door that concern disappeared. I also had occasion to use the business center on the third floor, and the connections were fast and printers and other equipment worked well.I used room service for dinner, and it was remarkably quick. I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken, and it arrived within ten minutes, complete with warm dinner rolls.I would also recommend this hotel for families. The sofa in the living room was actually a sofabed, and the small refrigerator could hold enough items to cut down on costs. There is a convenience store directly across the street. The hotel itself is in an excellent location near the Hancock building.In fact, I am thinking of visiting Chicago and the Hilton Suites/Magnificent Mile again -- this time with family in tow."
63,194,"Jul 19 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	Overall I had a wonderful Stay at the Hilton. Right across the street from the John Hancock building...walk out the door to magnificent mile. The valet could be slow at times, but I was only charged for one night when I really had the car for two nights. Not sure if that was on purpose or not, but the manager did take notice at the time of the delay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The beds were extremely comfortable!!! As a Hilton Diamond member I was given free continental breakfast...sure it wasn't a buffet, but compared to the other hotels in the area it was great. They really only offer continental breakfast for up to two people and I had three so they through in extra tickets. Also, I paid for one night (two double beds) and had 4 free nights (one king bed) they allowed me to stay in the double room the whole time. Couldn't ask for a better stay. I will surely return to this location."
64,194,"May 30 2007 	For business or pleasure you cant ask for anything more	I have rated allot of hotels on this website and not many I choose as excellent, but Hilton Suites in Chicago earns it. Not because its opulent or amazing luxurious, although its luxuriously modern and functional. I think its outstanding because it has absolutely everything you could possibly need in a hotel on business or pleasure.The rooms are very updated, modern, well maintained and clean. The suite is perfect for those on business wanting a place to work in the living room while watching tv and on the internet. There is lots of room to spread out with a full size couch, plasma tv that you can adjust to any place you are sitting, a very functional desk and internet access. The bathroom is spacious and full size which is rare in a big city but always appreciated. The bedroom has a wonderful bed and while the bedroom is not huge, really all you are doing in there is sleeping so how much room do you need in there. The staff is wonderful and friendly. There is starbucks in the lobby and the hotel restaurant is really good, people from outside the hotel eat there.I rarely run across hotels that I am completely comfortable with enough room to work, sleep and bathe but this hotel has everything you could possibly need and you will feel very comfortable in the suite with plenty of room to spare. It doesnt have the luxury of the Drake or Weston but it has everything you need in a business or pleasure hotel to have a wonderful stay.Even if you dont work out you should check out the pool and fitness facility, they are on the top floor and have a great view. While the fitness center isnt huge it has modern well maintained equipment.Excellent stay at a great hotel with great rooms and services in the perfect location for walking around to eat or shop. If you are in town on business this should be at the top of your list."
65,194,"May 23 2007 	Appalling and Unethical Billing	I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago with a couple of my girlfriends from grad school. Loved the city, other than the wind. Absolutely disgusted with the Hilton Suites we stayed in. A couple of weeks after returning home, I happened to check my credit card balance to find a extra $100 charge from the hotel. Assuming it was some kind of mistake, I called to let the hotel know. They proceded to tell me that they did not know what the charge was at that time, but that they would call me back. I gave my phone number, email and name. They proceeded to call one of the other girls who stayed in the room and to tell her the charge was for &quot;trashing&quot; the room! I can assure you, we left the room in perfect condition with all of our &quot;trash&quot; by the door. We barely spent any time in the room as it is. The manager told me they had a report and pictures of the damage to the room, but when I requested they send copies to me with an explanation of the $100 charge, he insisted he was not allowed to do that. Can you imagine, it is their word against mine, and they don't have to provide any type of receipt or evidence, but can charge me this ridiculous charge! Something in this scenario does not add up. I'm disputing the charge through my credit card company, but feel this is completely unbelievable, not to mention unethical. I am over the $100, but not the principle. I will never stay in a Hilton, and am passing this information on to spare others this experience."
66,194,May 18 2007 	Great Location	We were able to get a rate of $160 a night through the hotel website which for Chicago seemed to be a good deal for a 2 night weekend stay. We found the newly renovated suites very nice - with a flat screen in the living area and a nice bar. The location was great - convenient to everything. The only complaint that we had was the slowness of the service at breakfast - we were given a voucher for continental breakfast - which they applied to a full breakfast. The cost of valet parking was typical Chicago - $43 a day.
67,194,"May 4 2007	Good hotel miss the doubletree cookies	We have stayed at this hotel many times (as the previous incarnation as a Doubletree and now as the Hilton Suites). Overall, it is a very nice hotel and a pretty good deal for the Magnificent Mile area of downtown. We have paid approximately $150/ night on weekend nights- straight off of the hotel website. The prices are actually usually a little bit cheaper if you book earlier in our experience (have ranged between $100-200 for Sat nights over the last few years).PROS:1. Rooms are very clean, bedding is very comfortable.2. Rooms are quiet now that construction is done3. Location- very near the John Hancock building4. Views- ask for a high room on the lakeside, gorgeous viewsCONS:1. Flat screen tv in the living room had horrible reception- seriously! We didn't watch much tv, but the one in the bedroom is the only one that is watchable (and I'm used to a 12 inch tv that is 20 years old).2. The concierge service is not that great. We tried to get breakfast suggestions and so far, have gotten nothing more creative than the Cheesecake factory around the corner.3. Miss the cookies that they had when it was a DoubletreeNEUTRAL1. Front desk staff has varying degrees of helpfulness. Some are somewhat rude. Some bend over backwards to be nice.We will continue staying here unless I read about a better place for the same price on tripadvisor!"

69,194,"Apr 26 2007 	great room no maid service	I booked online prepaid and got a 197/night rate. Room was ready when I arrived at 9pm sunday night. Room was half way up the tower with a glimpse of the lake between the buildings. It was near the elevator but very quiet. The room is a two room suite with a living room with desk, flat screen tv, wetbar, and sofa. The bedroom had a king bed.This room was excellently outfitted for the business traveller. It was the first room I stayed in where I could work on the laptop,eat room service, and channel surf through the TV, all at the sametime from one sitting location. The desk was large and had a pull out table for dinner. So no clearing off the desk for the dinner.Moreover, the TV was on a wall next to the desk so I could watchthe tube inbetween emails and bites of dinner. The bedroom was small, just big enough for the king bed and too small for a regular door. Mine had skinny french doors which wasodd, but they worked fine. The bathroom was spacious and everything worked well.My only complaint was that they forgot to make up my room while I wasgone all day at work. I came back at 9pm the next night to find the room as I left it in the morning. I called the operator and the maid service was sent immediately and they quickly replaced my towels etc.The rooms are recently renovated and they look really nice. Also the hotel has windows that open which means you can get fresh air. This is getting more unusual these days for high rise hotels and it was much appreciated by me, especially since the new furniture and carpetin the room still has an odor and thus the rooms can use a bit of airing out from the new materials.Another small issue was that I needed a credit card receipt because I paid in advance. Hilton did not email me any receipt and the hotel could not give me the information. So I had to call Hilton after my stay and ask for a receipt. They were able to email me the receipt within an hour of my phone call and I was able to submit withmy business expenses.Staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay there again on another trip."
70,194,"Apr 19 2007 	Hilton Suites - I'd go back again	My 11 y.o. son and I enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Suites, located one block east of Michigan Avenue along East Delaware Place. The John Hancock Building is directly across the street.For tourists this hotel is nicely located. Guests are close to Michigan Avenue but don't have to put up with the traffic noise on that very busy street. Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) busses to Museum Place (Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum), the Chicago Zoo and the Museum of Science and Technology all stop at the corner of Michigan &amp; Delaware (one block from hotel). Many bus lines run north/south along Michigan Avenue, so it is easy to hop on a bus after you get tired of walking along The Magnificent Mile. The nearest subway stop (Red Line) is the &quot;Chicago&quot; station, located about 5 blocks away if I recall correctly. We purchased CTA 5-day visitor passes ($18 each) which allow unlimited use of the bus and subway system. Much cheaper and more convenient than renting a car. Bus drivers and passengers were more than willing to answer questions about &quot;is this the right bus?&quot;. After a day or two we were getting around on CTA like native Chicagoans.By the way, If you are going to the Blue Man Group show (my son loved this show) you can easily get there by subway from downtown.We used the subway when we returned to O'Hare airport for our flight home. This worked out quite nicely as we avoided the cost of a shuttle or taxi, plus breezed by all of the traffic on the expressway. I wouldn't suggest trying this right at rush hour with your suitcase; we left downtown around 3 p.m. and had no problems getting on the subway with our 22 inch rolling suitcases.Our suite on the 24th floor of the Hilton Suites was as others here have already described. My son used the pull-out sofa bed which was perfect for him but an adult might find it uncomfortable.Hotel staff ranged from the disinterested (doormen who couldn't bother to greet returning guests) to the absent (never did see a concierge) to the helpful (front desk personnel).I would stay here again."
71,194,"Apr 19 2007 	Great room; great staff	During Easter break we stayed 2 week-nights at the Hilton Suites and found it very comfortable for 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 10 &amp; 13). Got a suite (as reserved) and it looked exactly like the pictures on the web site. All updated furnishings and loved the 2 TV's &amp; big bathroom. Bedding was great, clean, &amp; comfy. Extra bedding for sofa bed stored in zipped plastic bag (never seen that before)! Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Kids liked the pool (good temp) and we liked the view. Sauna control was broken but didn't really miss it. We did not hear any disruptive noise during our stay. As others wrote, be prepared for expensive parking at hotel (we traveled by train &amp; taxis).Restaurant at hotel (Mrs. Parks Tavern) was very spendy for breakfast ($3 for kids milk; $3.50 for apple juice); we only ate there because of a promotional coupon. Cheesecake Factory nearby is good, but very busy (70 min wait). Make reservation then wait back at hotel!I did a lot of research on-line before booking this room and made a good choice with the comfort and value; we were not disappointed."
72,194,"Apr 19 2007 	Easter Break In Chicago	Stayed at the Hilton Suites Chicago the week after Easter. My family originally booked the Chicago Hilton but switched to this hotel because of the proximity to attractions, shopping on the Magnificent Mile, and the many choices of family restaurants within walking distance. Check in was a breeze and the staff was very courteous and helpful with valet parking and bellhop assistance. The room was not a 2 room suite, but we had plenty of room for a family of five (2 adults, 3 children). Two double beds and a pull out sofa. Had a great view on the 26th floor of the John Hancock Building. Also microwaves and a mini refrigerator were complimentary which is a great plus with kids.Pool was OK and room service was fine. Overall the hotel is a solid choice for families, and the location is great. The week had some rough weather, but we still managed to have a fun vacation."
73,194,"Apr 4 2007	This place has many faults	I was in chicago to celebrate my mothers 69th birthday. I was given a pleasant room on the 26th Floor by a delightful manager Christine, Thank You. Upon arrival Friday 3/30 ,I nor my wife were assisted withour bags by doorman whoi were busy chatting. The cab fare from O'harewas $45 dollars and valet parking was $43 per day. On Saturday 3/31I we took cab from hotel to field Museum which cost $19 plus tip. Therese no street parking around downtown Chicago so by mid day I decided to rent a car. We had dinner at a Cheesecake factory restuarant upon our return across the street in the Hancock tower. On4/1we took a trip to a Harrahs Casino in Joliet which is about a 45 minute drive. The hotel has no in room safe so i stored several electronic devives in my hard side samsonite TSA approved luggage. Upon return I went to pack for departure th e next day the lock was broken on one side. I filed a report with hotel security and made a follow up call but have heard nothing. We went to an early lunch at The Signature Room on the 95 Floor of the Hancock Tower which has a lunch buffet for $18.99 M-S excluding drinks and dessert. Restaurant has spectacular views so skip the observatory. Overall Chicago is nice but as expensive as New York"
74,194,"Mar 12 2007	Hidden gem	This hotel is a great choice. My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay and we wanted a kitchenette so we ended up here. Even though It was not my first choice I am so glad we did. The room was quiet, with urban chic decor. Bathroom was large with adjoining dressing area off the bedroom. Down comforter encased in clean sheets ( no common bedspread) on the Heavenly bed and plenty of down pillows. Thermostat has fan controlls for Hi Low and Auto. Floor to ceiling windows with blackout draperys. Beautifull pool and workout area on the top floor with spectacular views of lake Michigan, make an effort to go up. Location is north end by the best boutique shopping and Rush street resuraunts, much nicer than by the river. Has a quiet bar and resturaunt so for night life go to the Westin or Drake bars. Coffeemaker is by individual cup but the lobby sells Starbucks."
75,194,Mar 4 2007	Hideous decor	With all the lovely hotels in Chicago there is no reason to stay here. My room was not a suite and there was no kitchenette. The lighting was outrageously bad and the decor is too ugly for words. The hotel attracts loud groups so beware.
76,194,"Mar 2 2007 	Great location and stay	Very nice suites with kitchen/bar (sink, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker), sofa, desk and plasma TV. Separate bedroom area with door and very comfortable bed. Staff very accommodating. Excellent location. Only drawback - the walls may be a bit thin if you are a light sleeper.."
77,194,"Feb 7 2007	Great Hotel!!	We visited Chicago on 13th January 2007 for 7 nights.We booked this hotel due to the proximity to all the tourist sights in chicago and we were not disappointed!The hotel was fantastic, all the staff were very polite and their service was second to none. All the services provided by the hotel were good, the restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was delicious. The bar also had no faults and was suitable for a quiet drink, with the bar staff being always attentive to your needs while making you feel very welcome.The pool (although we didn't use it) looked good and gave you a view over the lake which was impressive!But the best part of the hotel for both of us was the room, it was spacious but comfortable consisting of a living area with microwave, fridge, coffee machine, plasma tv, a well equiped bathroom, and a bedroom with the WORLDS MOST COMFORTABLE BED!! Let's put it this way I would never get up for work if this was my bed at home!!The hotel is in walking distant or a short taxi ride for shopping, restaurants, and all the major tourist sights. I would recommend to eat at the Cheesecake factory situated under the John Hancock building, the banana cream cheesecake for dessert is a must! Follow this up by a drink in the signature lounge (at the top of the John Hancock building) for the most breath taking night-time view of the city.I also recommend a visit to the Lincoln Park zoo its full of great animals and its free!!All in all an excellent hotel in an excellent city, we fully intend to return."
78,194,"Jan 2 2007	Great Near North Value	For a most comfortable hotel on the near north side of the city, you cannot beat this hotel. Clearly one of the most comfortable hotels we've stayed in and a great value to boot. Only a block from Water Tower shopping and Michigan Avenue with great ammenities...room layout is the best! Lobby restaurant was excellent and staff very helpful and courteous. Highly recommend it."
79,194,Nov 27 2006 	Excellent	No complaints at all. Nice location; friendly staff; nice gym &amp; pool. Will stay here again without hesitation.
80,194,"Oct 4 2006	Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during a recent business trip. The room was prepaid by my employer, so I have no idea how much it cost. However, I can say that the room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable. The location is in Magnificent Mile area, next to the Hancock tower (as far as I could tell the high end part of downtown Chicago). I felt very comfortable walking around and taking the metro (station is about 5 blocks away). Plenty of upscale shops and restaurants are nearby. I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel"
81,194,"Aug 20 2006 	What a nice surprise!	My son (23) and I go to Chicago at least once a summer. I booked 2 nights at the Hilton (it was still the Doubletree at that time) for free, using my Hilton Honors points, so I didn't have really high expectations. But free is good.We drove in from Michigan on a Friday afternoon, circled the block a few times before we decided the Doubletree was now the Hilton, and checked in. Warning -- valet parking at the hotel is hideously expensive, even considering it's Chicago -- $60/night! But again, the rooms were free so...Registration must have heeded other people's feedback -- not only was it friendly and efficient, but the young woman kept apologizing any time she made me wait more than a nanosecond. Second complaint -- there was no offer to help us with our bags to the room. We handled everything, but I normally expect the offer in a hotel that nice.Room was excellent -- large, clean, elegant, well-laid out. Flat screen tv in LR, enough coffee for me to make it till we went downstairs, refrigerator/microwave for the left-over Pizza Uno we brought back Friday pm. LR had comfortable seatage -- sleeper couch (although my son would dispute the sleeper comfort, it's no worse than any other), side chair, desk chair. Had a small view of the lake. Bed was very comfortable, with gobs of pillows, great linens and a comfortable woolen throw just right for afternoon napping. More than enough closet/drawer space, and a cunning little vanity for makeup and hair.Best part was the bathroom. I like the 2-doors -- one into my BR, one into the LR. Very private and personal. Curved shower curtain bar is a major plus --there is nothing nastier than shower curtain stickage. Good products and lots of towels, although, rather puzzling, no hair dryer.Restaurant downstairs is very good (Mrs. Parks) -- my late husband and I had actually dined there several years ago -- not fancy but tasty. Vastly overpriced for breakfast -- you're better off wandering 3 blocks to Bistro 110. Great location for shopping, sight-seeing, etc. -- we walked lots of places, but caught cabs to Wrigley and Second City. In the past, my son and I stayed at Lenox Suites or Homewood Suites. Hilton is far nicer in a comparable or better location, and has become my preference, as long as I can use points again."
82,194,"Aug 19 2006	Perfect for the Family!	We stayed at this lovely hotel in Aug 06, with our family of5 kids. We had 2 suites which were adjoining, and perfect for our family. They were newly renovated and in excellent condition. The bathrooms are new, the beds are fluffy and fresh, the staff was friendly and accomodating. We had excellent service, the Valet inparticular was so helpful with our car always going in and out in the city. The location is excellent in the City, right off ofMichigan Avenue. Could not have had a better area in the city. It was very residential, but accessible to all. THe pool was great for the kids, and room service was always good. We felt so fortunate to have found this great spot with our big family! We would def go back!"
83,194,"Jul 29 2006 	What a great surprise	First a caveate; we paid the Hilton employee rate of $39/ night although not actually employees. We spent 3 nights here then moved to the more &quot;upscale&quot; Conrad and were much more impressed with the Doubletree. The size of the room is amazing. The separate rooms, the wetbar, fridge and micro and coffee. Lovely lovely and comfortable.  The pool was a real treat. I expected a typical midwestern indoor pool, but the view was fantastic. Gorgeous views of the lake and the Handcock building- and the pool area with it's tiled walls and sky high windows ... well I just wish we got to spend more time. The second time we tried to go to the pool there were no towels so we left. That's my only complaint. The only negatives were poor organization at checkin and trying to check our bags until our room was ready was a bit of a challenge. There's no real bar at the hotel, always empty and closed by ten. The coffee shop is outrageous. $10.50 for a premade, cold wrapped sandwich. We live in San Diego which is expensive but even here, the Hilton coffee shop sandwiches are only $5.50 Over all, the location is perfect. Walked everywhere. If we couldn't walk we took the subway/ El. Great great great. Went to the Signature Lounge at the Handcock twice. Shopped on Michigan ave. Took in a Cubs game, just a quick ride up the red line. Architectural boat tour, Field Museum. Museum of Contemporary Art is right around the corner. Everything convenient to this location.Left a mostly full bottle of Absolute vodka in the fridge - oops. Hope the housekeeper enjoyed it - it was well earned."
84,194,"Jul 27 2006	Great location	Hotel was in a very convienient location to Navy Pier. In addition you had easy access to public transportation right off of Maryland. Cabs were readily available if you are not into buses or the train/subway. Hotel was exceptionally clean during my visit. They are changing to the Hilton name and were doing some painting, but it was very early in the morning and was not a bother at all.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The fact the rooms are suites is convenient for two adults and up to two children. The pull out couch isn't comfortable enough for adults to use for very long.Staff was pleasant. Didn't use room service, but heard good things about it from others who did."
85,194,"Jul 18 2006	Great stay at the Doubletree	Stayed at the Doubletree for a 3 night weekend at the end of June. Used Hilton Honors rewards but the room was listed at over $300 per night on the website. We had a one king suite on the 25th floor with an awesome view of Lake Michigan. Our room was very recently redone (as a matter of fact there was still the smell of paint in tha hall way) with the flat screen tv. Bed was very comfortable with nice linens and tons of pillows. Liked the separate make-up vanity so one could shower while one finished up outside of bathroom. Mini fridge great for holding those take out cheesecake slices from Cheesecake Factory. Location was perfect for us, we walked everywhere except Andy's Jazz Club we cabbed. Walked to Navy Pier, Ogden boat slip for river tour, Museum of Contemp. Art, up and down Michigan Ave, beach, tons of restaurants nearby. Ate at Bistro 110, Andy's, Saloon Steakhouse for dinner, top of the Hancock for lunch (highly recommend lunch here). Had breakfast one morning in hotel restaurant, good food, service and speedy. Other mornings got juice and muffins from the coffee stand in lobby. We used the exercise room twice, small but nice machines and amazing city view (it is on the top floor), also where the pool is. Hotel staff was very nice, concierge particularly helpful. We would stay here again!"
86,194,"Jun 19 2006	Pretty Good Stay	Stayed at the Doubletree June 13-16, 2006. With the exception of some problems at check-in, I enjoyed this hotel and would stay there again. Also, the air conditioner didn't work in our room and it took 2 phone calls to correct the problem. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a grocery store right across the street that made fabulous sandwiches. The beds were AWESOME as were the pillows. Note, the pull out sofa bed in our room was very uncomfortable and was not meant for one adult to sleep on, let alone two. Would probably be ok for a small child. The location was perfect. We got a good rate for our rooms and would stay there again in a heartbeat for the same rate."
87,194,"Jun 9 2006	The hotel made the trip!	Highly recommended hotel. Spacious, generously sized, recently renovated rooms with mini-fridge and microwave (but note no dishes are provided). Loved the LCD flat screen TV in the living room and entrances to the bathroom from both the living and bedrooms. Convenient coffee bar in lobby. Fantastic location across from John Hancock building and one block from Lake Michigan. My standard room even boasted a sliver view of the lake. Note there is rather noisy construction at a parking garage next to the John Hancock but I was not able to hear it from my room and I am very particular about noise. Michigan Avenue and all buses are one block away, subway line is about a ten minute walk to Chicago station. Staff was extremely friendly at check-in and out. Arriving in my room, I was absolutely overjoyed with the accomodations!"
88,194,"May 21 2006	Good but not great	Our family of four stayed at the Doubletree for six nights and were awakened each morning by construction noise in the suite across the hallway. When I complained to the front desk staff about the hammering that started at about 7:30, I was told that sometimes the workers start even earlier, implying, I guess, that I should be thankful! She offered to switch our room but informed me that the construction was going on all over the hotel and could not guarantee a more quiet suite. The suite itself was nice but small. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The jacuzzi near the pool, however, was dirty--and remained that way even though we showed an employee the mildew growing on the sides. The pool water was nice and warm and the view from that room was wonderful. This hotel's location and reasonable rates are its best assets."
89,194,"May 16 2006	Absolutely the best beds ever!	Our family of four stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Chicago for a long weekend/wedding. Our accommodations were at a group rate for $229 for a 2 room suite which included a very spacious living room with desk, plasma tv, fold out sofa (very comfortable according to my picky teenage daughter), chair, coffee table and sink/fridge/microwave station as well as a bedroom with another tv, 2 double beds, dresser, table and a large bathroom. The suite appeared to have been recently renovated as everything was in top condition. The best thing about our entire stay were THE BEDS!!! These were the most comfortable, luxurious beds I have ever slept in at any hotel. From the soft, plush down pillows and comforter to the cushiony, but firm mattress to the luxurious sheets...it was a pleasure to go to bed at night! All of the guests at the hotel from our group raved about their beds.Service at the hotel was what should be expected at any hotel; courteous, considerate and kind. We had a mistaken charge on our bill that was promptly removed. The bellmen were always gracious when storing our luggage before and after our stay for a few hours. I also appreciated the maid service for our room who, when we walked through the doorway as she was finishing up her cleaning, made sure to verify that our room key worked for the room before she departed. She was very kind and never made us feel uncomfortable. The location of this resort is ideal for those who want a short walk to the Magnificent Mile shops and the John Hancock building. The location, service, accommodations and price made us very happy with our stay and ready to return the next time we visit Chicago."
90,194,May 15 2006	Perfect for Families!	Just got back from a stay here at the Doubletree in Chicago. My husband and I took our 3 year old daughter with us this time! The room was perfect (a tad on the small side) but very clean and simple room. It was nice having two rooms- so after she went to sleep we could enjoy a little wine and tv without waking her up! The room had a nice size fridge which is very nice when traveling with a toddler. The hotel location is perfect for running around in the city- very central to everything and a bus stop for the major museums right at the corner. The pool upstairs was plus too! Nothing fancy but very clean and quiet with a pretty view! Overalll we were very pleased with the hotel great location and value!!
91,194,"May 3 2006	Good Place	Good place for a family to stay. Our suite was large enough for the 3 of us - parents and teenager. The suite had all we needed and included a nice view - we could see a bit of Lake Michigan. We liked the proximity to local sites, not a far walk to the subway and it was always easy to get a taxi when necessary. Overall it was a nice, clean place to stay if you want to be in downtown Chicago."
92,194,"Apr 14 2006	Great Stay Nice Location Great Hotel	Had a nice stay at this Doubletree. I was worried when I read of what people wrote. Rooms: Clean, large, comfortable beds and pillowsHotel: Nice, clean, staff were helpful and freindlyLocation: 1/2 Block over from Mag. Mile, near Lake, shopping, etc..I would stay again for the location and price."
93,194,"Apr 5 2006	Eh	For the cost of this hotel, you can find much better elsewhere in the city. I requested early check in and could not get into the room early. I ended up checking if *after* the check in time because the room was not ready. The woman at the check-in desk was rude.The towels in the room were very thin and torn. The pool was cold. No cookies."
94,194,"Nov 2 2005	Nice but not great	This is not the best Double Tree we have stayed at. The room was clean, the beds very comfy, and the location was great. BUT... the room was on the small side and a smidge stale smelling. My sister stayed in a room on the other side of the building. Her view was fantastic, ours was so so. We might go again, just for the location."
95,194,"Oct 31 2005	very average	My husband, 3 year-old daughter and I (former Chicago residents) have stayed in this hotel four times in the past 12 months. Our most recent was Oct 2005. Each time we stay we say we do not want to return but still keep coming back! The location, as has been mentioned, is perfect. I love it. The staff, overall are very friendly. The rooms are quite shabby and really need updating (for example, the couches are quite worn). I have never seen the pool too busy but it always too cold. During our last stay I asked twice to have the heat increased in the pool. The first person told me it could not be increased, the second was able to turn it up slightly. The view from the pool is beautiful. The equipment in the work out room is all fairly new and well kept/clean.Each time we plan a trip to Chicago I look and look and end up at the Doubletree because of the price. You can stay in hotels with the same level of rooms and pay _much_ more in similar locations (The Embassy Suites, for example). If you are willing to put up with a few issues (shabby room, cold pool, good but not great service) in exchange for a fabulous location and a low rate then the Doubletree is the place."
96,194,"Oct 21 2005	Nice stay at Doubletree	First of all: This hotel is in a great location. Right across you will find the John Hancock Center and Magnificent Mile is just one block away.The service was generally friendly and helpful, even though sometimes not very talkative.The rooms are just fine, my room was absolutely identical to the one advertised on the Expedia Website. I was given a room on the 8th floor which didn't have much of a view but was quiet and clean, so I didn't mind. It seems as if you should try to avoid rooms close to the elevators, because they are busy the whole night.Room service was perfect and I really enjoyed the Blenz Cafe in the Lobby which serves little treats - and you can enjoy free wireless broadband Internet access there if you bring your Notebook along - there are no PCs available. I enjoyed this feature a lot!Overall I would definitely stay at Doubletree Guest Suites again, as location and price are perfect and the service and rooms are above average."
97,194,"Aug 30 2005	Wonderful experience	My husband and I are frequent vistors of Chicago, we stayed at other hotels like the Intercontinel on Michigan Ave which was also very nice. Doubletree was in a great location, we walked to the Cheesecake Factory, Dick's Last Resort, Uno's etc. The room was very clean and spacious, the staff was also very helpful. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend others to come."
98,194,"Aug 16 2005	Excellent location only one block off the Magnificent Mile!	We stayed here for five nights. Four of us (2 adults, 2 children) were very comfortable in a two room suite. The rooms are clean &amp; quiet and the beds are very comfortable. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. Umbrellas were provided to guests on rainy days. The pool and spa are a big plus after a long day. Yes, it gets a bit crowded in the evening, but not so bad after 9 p.m. Easy walking distance to restaurants - try Cedar and Rush streets for something other than franchise food. I would highly recommend the Doubletree to anyone travelling with children."
99,194,"Jun 13 2005	Don't count on the pool	We live in the suburbs of Chicago, but stayed here for two nights over spring break in March. We thought it would be fun to enjoy the city and a pool. Well, forget about the pool. It is small and was extremely crowded. We tried to go three times. Finally, we went early in the morning. It was still crowded, but the kids were determined to swim. It was really loud and not too much fun. The hotel was ok otherwise, but don't go if you are counting on enjoying a pool."
100,194,May 18 2005	First Time To Chicago	My daughter lives there now and this was our first time to Chicago and the hotel was quite good. The price was reasonable and that is something I pay attention to because of the exchange rate Canadian to U.S adds at least 20% to your bill. On check in you do get the warm Chocalte Chip cookies which is a nice touch. The rooms are not huge but more than acceptable and the beds are soooooooooo comfortable. Location is fantastic and the food in the restaurant is o.k. Staff are very friendly and helpful yet low keyed which was fine. Over all we had a great stay and would go back with out hesitation. I should mention the pool and the hot tub and although the pool isn't huge I have seen smaller at other hotels. Hot tub was great. Exercise facilities were well equiped. Again well worth the price of admission.
101,194,"Mar 17 2005	Right in the action!	This was our first time visiting Chicago, so I just had to research hotels on the internet and take a shot. We knew we wanted to be near the Magnificent Mile, as well as Navy Pier. We have 2 kids and wanted to feel safe walking downtown. It turned out to be a great location.  We were treated to warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival and found our accomodations wonderful. The children slept in the sleeper sofa in the front room with their own TV and we had the privacy of the bedroom plus a separate dressing area.  The pool on the top floor had breathtaking views of the lake and surrounding city. The water was plenty warm and the jacuzzi was welcome. My husband worked out in the fitness facility with the same awesome views.  We had breakfast at the bakery on the main level that served Krispy Kremes! They also had fruit, yogurt, and other simple items. The best thing was being so close to everything! My 11 year old daughter and I trolled the shops at night and we were right across from the mall! There was an electric vibe with trendy eateries and shoppers galore.  We took the bus to the Museum of S and I, which was an experience in itself. The hotel staff was a bit lost on helping with transportation, but we got there! It took forever, and we had a few transfers, but it was fun to see the bustling Chicago work week in action. I've never seen so many high heeled boots and Burberry scarves!  We also walked to Navy Pier. It was a bit of a hike, especially in the 45 degree Oct. weather, but an easy route and very doable.  I'd definitely stay at the Doubletree Suites again. Great location, practical accomodations for my family, and reasonable price, especially for downtown!"
102,194,"Jan 9 2005	Would recommend!	Be advised the double beds are full size but SO COMFORTABLE, I would buy the mattress if I didn't already buy one that I haven't paid off yet. Also they have white down comforters that are so fluffy and cozy, beats those normal hideous bedspreads you usually see in hotels. They try to make you feel at home...The free cookies rock and it's the best location I have ever stayed in Chicago and I've been there countless times. Would recommend."
103,194,"Jan 2 2005	Good Location Big Room	My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree East Delaware on Dec. 27. For the record the week between Christmas and New Years is an awesome time to go to Chicago, because hotel rates are often below $100 for a nice room. That is at least a 40% savings over other weeks. The Doubletree rate for this day was $114 for a suite on the 21 st floor with a good view of Lake Mich. The room was in good, if not great shape. Seperate living area and bed area with seperate doors into the bathroom . Small sink and fridge in living room but no microwave. All in all the room was worth the price and I would not hesitate to go back with my kids- l.r. couch folded out into a huge bed. The location is great, one block to the Drake. Three to four blocks to all the food and fun of rush and division. Just a quick walk, unless the weather is cold, then I would taxi it... The check in and check out was really quick. The attitude of the workers was also good. One small problem- parking out front and waiting for an attendant could be a real pain in the drain as their are few spots in front of the hotel. We lucked out... but on a Sunday morning it could be a 20-30 minute wait for your car easily..."
104,194,"Jan 2 2005	Very Disappointing	This is a great location and the staff was generally friendly, but the service and state of our room (2309) was poor. Shabby furniture and a huge crack along the whole length of the bathroom sink.The maid did not leave towels, neither did the turn-down service. It took TWO calls to housekeeping to get towels. The toliet overflowed--it took an hour for someone to come fix it. Then that person did not mop up the half-inch of water. Two more calls and another hour later someone came to mop it up (Now after midnight). That person used half the towels mopping it up! No replacements.The ethernet connection did not work--that took two calls and eight hours to fix. They charge $9.95 for in-room internet connection--a fact NOT noted anywhere on the numerous ads for it or on the website. There is, however, free wireless in the lobby. I admit, hotels charging extra for internet is a pet peeve of mine, but my real complaint is the lack of communciation about the charge when one reserves--or at least in the room.Also, if noise and bustling is a problem for you, know in advance it is filled with families and kids. (Not a big deal for me, but it is for some folks.)Next time we'll stay elsewere."
105,194,"Oct 3 2004	Heavenly Served	I travel to Chicago three or four times a year and I always stay here. The location is ideal and the view is breath taking. The hotelrooms are modern and kept updated. Downstairs there is a restaurant and a starbucks that provide excellent service. The staff is professional, courteous and I thank them for each and every stay, without them the hotel would not be the same.The valet is a third party contract so don't hold it against the Doubletree, only the General Manager for hiring them. They lost my car, dont ask me how. After waiting an hour with no luck on their search I had to take a cab. Sure enough by the time I returned (5 hours later) they located my rental (it was okay, just misplaced)."
106,194,"Sep 14 2004 	A Place to return to	I have stayed at this hotel when in Chicago on business for a number of years. Location, Location, Location! Yes... the rooms could use some renovation but for the price the size and amenties are great. The indoor pool is a real plus and the staff are fine, not great but perfectly sufficient for this type and price class of hotel. Some rooms have views of nothing and some have great views. You get what you pay for. This is a great, quiet hotel for a business or shopping excursion."
107,194,"May 27 2004	Excellent Service	Before we travelled from Barbados, we read the reviews and were a little skeptical after we read some of the negative comments about the hotel. We couldn't change as my wife was going to a conference and this is the hotel that her company chose. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised - we got the cookies, even a set for our 10 month old!! - He even got another on check out! The staff from the bellmen to the front desk staff were extremely courteous and helpful. The suite was clean as expected, but as mentioned by another reviewer the minibar was filled with and left very little space for any personal items. This was a bit of a challenge as we needed to refridgerate some of our baby's food stuff. The suite did not have a microwave but we asked for one and got it on the third day after someone checked out. If you need one, make sure and request it when you book the room. Even then, someone from guest services took the baby food and microwaved it for us.On the first day, we were expecting a package and security couldn't find it. They then discovered that it had not yet been inventoried as having been received had not yet been placed in the proper area, so for the inconvenience, we were comped a movie.The restaurant food was nice but a bit expensive, but hey this is the Magnificent Mile!! We discovered on our 4th night that the front desk has menus from Diningin.com, that list over 20 restaurants that you can order from and have delivered to your door.All in all, I can say that this was a great stay at a great hotel. ALL of the staff were pleasant and in my opinion the service was above par. Will definitely stay there again and recommend it highly."
108,194,"May 6 2004	Not a bad stay	This hotel was good for the money we paid. I booked it a couple of months in advance of our March, 2004 stay. We paid $144/nt, for two adults and 3 kids (ages 10 to 4).Our primary goal this trip was make a pilgrimage to the Mecca of all doll stores, the American Girl Place. This hotel was very convenient to that store, as well as to other great stores on Michigan Ave and the lakeshore. In fact, after arriving, we walked down to the lake and along the lakefront. Check in was good -received the damn cookies - which, of course, made the kids even more wired than they already were after a 6-hour car ride! Got a room on the 28th floor. All rooms are suites, but I would classify them as small suites. The refrigerator was jammed with the mini-bar crap and hardly any room for the stuff we brought and wanted to refrigerate. TV in main area was small and too low - almost on the ground, tough to watch the NCAA Final Four! Beds, bathroom were fine.Fitness area was nice; pool on the 30th floor is neat, but it was pretty small. Whirlpool is nice sized. Nice men/women locker rooms for showering after swimming. Tried the hotel restaurant, not bad, interesting but limited menu, expensive.This hotel definitely has a feel of a renovated hotel where they spruced her up a bit, but didn't go the full 10 yards. However, for downtown Chicago, the location and price are attractive and we would stay there again."
109,194,"Apr 3 2004	Great staff nice pool BUT horrid hotel	I love trip advisor and use the reviews a lot when booking vacations but, boy, did it steer me wrong this time. Briefly, the staff was very helpful, the pool nice, but the hotel itself and the rooms are awful. People, you can do so much better at the Wyndham or the new Embassy Suites Lakefront for a cheaper price and breakfast included!! I choose the Doubletree because of the rave reviews it received and because of the great location, right across from John Hancock. I booked an executive suite so we would have a great view. Well, the veiw was as promised but the room was just dismal. Dirty carpets, torn and filthy upholstery, doors falling off the closet. The room was a smoking room, as well, although I had booked a non-smoking one. The manager (great guy, very helpful) told me that they were full and they had one room left which they were cleaning. I asked if it was perhaps better quality then the one we were staying in and he sadly shook his head no. He took me to see the room which was just as dismal and dingy as the one we were in. I didn't want my children even sitting on the furniture. He apparently agreed with me about the quality of the rooms and offered to do whatever would make me happy. I asked him to find other accomodations for us which he quickly did at the new lakefront Embassy Suites (loved it). He then called the Bell Captian to assist us and arranged for our car to be brought around. On the way to get our luggage the Bell Captain( also a very nice guy) told us that we would be much happier at the other hotel. That about says it all! By the way, there were no chocolate chip cookies to be found."
110,194,Mar 28 2004	A haven of peace. (Away from the lifts).	Aaaaah. I had an unexpected two night stop in Chicago. The first night I spent at the O'Hare Hilton. In order to recover I phoned a friend for some advice and ended up here. This is lovely. Big big rooms. Suites even. As standard! I am currently sitting in my lounge/kitchen and can see my bedroom tempting me to one side and the bathroom to the other. I have two tellys! This is the life! Location is cool - just off Michican Avenue (posh shops for those not in the know) and close to the various &quot;I did it first&quot; Chicago Pizza Pie restaurants. There is a swimming pool on the 30th floor that has views over Lake Michigan. There! You want to come here already! Minus one mark for noisy lifts. I'm such a perfectionist!
111,194,Mar 24 2004	Stay away!

115,194,Dec 16 2003	We'd stay here again - and plan to do so again soon
116,194,Nov 12 2003	Very impressed with the Doubletree would stay here again.

122,194,Mar 26 2007	muy buena situacion
1,199,"Nov 6 2009 	It was as I expected using Tripadvisor as my guideline.	The hotel was close to the Union Station. We were able to walk there and back. It is an older building but the room was clean and the staff friendly and helpful. We had a suite and for 3 sisters it worked out very well. It included a pull out couch that was better than average. It is not a great appearing hotel but it suited us. However, the restaurant was not the best. As other reviewers commented it is next to a noisy highway."
2,199,"Oct 13 2009 	Reasonable place - Close to Downtown	Stayed here for 2 nights. Pros: Close to Downtown. You can walk to major downtown destinations (if the weather permits). Subway station is just outside the hotel. Rooms are clean. Friendly staff. Cheaper than other comparable hotels in the area. Cons: The main lobby is very small. Looks congested when 3 or 4 guests arrive together. The building itself is pretty old. No central location for microwave, refrigerator etc. (None was available in my room so I was looking for a place where I could warm any frozen meals. Could not find any)Overall, a reasonable place for the price. Other hotels in the vicinity were much more pricier on the dates that I visited."
3,199,"Aug 10 2009 	Good clean hotel convenient location uninformed reservation employee	Great hotel for our first trip to Chicago. We came up for the Harry Potter exhibit at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry - we highly recommend that for any HP fans (take the Blue Line to Jackson and then hop the #10 bus all the way to the museum)! Easy to find (right off highway 250), 1/2 a block from the Blue Line subway - so convenient! 10-15 minute walk to the Sears (er - Willis) Tower, and a little further on to downtown. The restaurant (Aurelio's) was pretty good - definitely go for the breakfast buffet! Remember to stop at the front desk for vouchers if you want to take advantage of the Kids Eat Free thing. Nice clean room, standard bathroom (but clean) and wonderfully firm beds. Fair warning, though, even if the person taking your reservation says it's okay, if you book a 2-double room, a rollaway is not permitted - apparently it's a fire hazard. The front desk employee said I'd have to upgrade to a Junior Suite to have a rollaway - $50 more per night. Oh and parking was pretty steep (but standard for the city) - skip the valet service and park yourself in the well-lit lot behind the hotel. Valet was $30 a day, we paid $23 for the weekend (24 hour $18+ 12 hour $5)."
4,199,"Aug 3 2009 	Good job Holiday Inn!	This Holiday Inn was very clean, quiet, and friendly! It was within walking distance from Union Station in Chicago. The room was big and comfortable. It had a small bench/chair, a desk chair and a &quot;comfy&quot; chair. It was nice to be able to sit in a chair instead of always on a bed. The pool on the rooftop was an added bonus. The water was a little chilly, but this summer has been very chilly. We could see the Willis Tower from the pool/rooftop. The hotel sat next to the Eisenhower Expressway, but it was barely heard from our 4th floor room. We walked to Union Station every morning and caught city buses to the attractions we wanted to see. The conceirges were very helpful and friendly!!! We had a great time at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Chicago!"
5,199,"Jan 5 2009 	Great for the price!	The staff in the was really nice and helpful, the hotel was very clean and the rooms were really nice too!The only thing that was disturbing was that the heater was making loud noises sometimes but everything else was great!"
6,199,"Dec 7 2008 	Not sure what is so good about the hotel	The hotel is located right downtown of Chicago in an area devoid of any tourist attractions, shops, restaurants but next to a VERY noisy and busy highway (24/7). Noise in the rooms is terrible. Other than that is is a standard HI, with somewhat dark decor, all things functional but no special charm. Front desk staff a bit indifferent. The adjacent restaurant is really a pizza place, ok but far from being special. The biggest issue was that the hotel was booked during a big convention and the price was correspondingly high ($200/night). At that rate - absolutely not worth the money."
7,199,"Nov 24 2008 	Wonderful amenities and a great location	Stayed three nights at a grand total cost of $618 for two-persons with a king bed. Room included full bath, phone, TV with 39 cable channels, temperature control, and free wi-fi. Hotel has an exercise room, an outdoor pool (available Memorial Day to Labor Day), and a computer room with two free PC's with internet access and a printer. Hotel was clean, well-maintained, and surprisingly quiet for being next to a freeway. Staff was VERY friendly and willing to assist with our visit. Within the hotel building is a chain pizza place that featured a bar, a full hot breakfast buffet (not included in room price), a pizza and pasta lunch buffet on week-days, and dinners. A convenience store was five blocks away, and several restaurants were a little beyond that.I noted that onsite, outdoor parking would be $16 per day, and nearby covered parking is $9 per day. However, since a 72 hour pass for unlimited rides on the CTA is only $12 per person, it is clearly best to not use a car when visiting Chicago.Hotel is located just a couple blocks from both the Amtrak Station and the bus station. The neighborhood is sufficiently safe that even a late night arrival would not be a problem -- just be aware of exactly how to get to the hotel, as Chicago's grid system makes all streets look alike. The hotel is also just a block from the &quot;Clinton&quot; stop on the CTA Blue Subway Line, meaning you can go from O'Hare Airport direct to the hotel -- and Midway Airport would require one change of train.You can easily either walk or ride the subway to the Loop, and the McCormick Center is a couple miles away. For us, the location was perfect."
8,199,"Sep 2 2008 	No complaints	This was a nice, quality hotel. The beds were a little small but comfortable. The staff made it better. This was our first trip to Chicago and they were very helpful and gave great tips. The pool is outdoors on the roof! Very nice view of Sears Tower. I thought it was supposed to be heated, but it was cold (and the weather was REALLY hot that day). Although it says &quot;downtown&quot; it isn't really. We had about a 10 minute walk to Union Station. I was a little nervous walking back to our hotel when it was dark (not a lot of lighting) with my small children but everything was fine. The price for parking was cheaper then other hotels (we paid $30.00). You could leave your car at the hotel until 4:00 on the day of check-out, which was really nice. Actually, the valet guy let us leave our car parked out front, let us take our keys, and just said to come get it when we could! Overall, I'd stay here again. But, it might be worth it to stay downtown so you wouldn't have to walk so much (but really, the walking wasn't that bad... and I've never stayed downtown so those are just my thoughts) :)"
9,199,"Aug 17 2008 	Holiday Inn Canal 	I arrived late on Friday night, only to find that I had made my reservation for arrival on Saturday. Kisha at the front desk cheerfully assured me that they had rooms, and got me squared away promptly with a joke and a smile. Every time she saw me thereafter she greeted me by name. The customer service at this hotel is top rate. There are always at least two concierge/bellmen ready to provide directions, call a cab (very quickly too!), or carry a bag for you. One of them even gave me a quarter when I was rooting through my purse for change for the newspaper. The desk staff is pleasant and very helpful. They met all of my needs very well. The room was nice. Clean, basic amenities, quiet even though the hotel is located right off interstate 290. Holiday Inn has a pillow menu, and there are three pillows on the bed. Nice quality toiletries in the bath (shampoo, conditioner, body soap, face soap, and lotion) but I do not like the smell of mint - not their fault. Good pressure and hot water in the shower. The penthouse (top floor) contains a workout area, a business center, and a rooftop outdoor pool. The pool was indeed chilly at 8:30 a.m., but in the afternoon the sun warmed it considerably. Neat to swim outside on the roof during the air show - good views. The business center was a computer and a printer - both worked well and quickly. Fast internet. The workout room has several good quality machines (treadmills, stairmasters, ellipticals) and televisions to view while working out. Everyone I met that worked for the hotel greeted me with what came across as sincere pleasure to see me, and made eye contact when saying hello or asking how to help. Onsite pizza restaurant was good enough - the waitstaff there was very friendly and accomodating. Prices were good - pizza was okay, but the breadsticks were quite good. There is also a small chicken and fish place next door - independently owned. Parking is $30 valet, or $16 to self park. Do the self park, the lot is just next door the hotel. It's not necessarily guarded, there are the usual caveats about your stuff, but I overlooked that lot and it was well lit at night. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path, but I walked downtown in 20 minutes, easily. It is near enough by cab to the Museum Campus. Cabs were quickly hailed by the bellmen, and are plentiful everywhere. They are also required to take credit cards in Chicago. You need to be firm with some of them about this, but they are. I will stay here again in November. I enjoyed the two night stay and found it to be a good value for the money, and a pleasant weekend lodging."
10,199,"May 28 2008	Average hotel.. not a lot to do!	Went for this hotel as it was right near the Amtrak station, you can literally walk from the station to the hotel, although it is a little difficult to see and get to. Just ask if you are stuck, but don't waste money on a cab!The hotel itself was OK. The room was clean and tidy. For some reason we had a disabled suite, so the shower was always leaking onto the bathroom floor and we had to laydown towels on a regular basis to keep out feet dry. But the room was good. Not a lot of noise going on, so a good nights sleep had each night. No complaints about the room, although this place was a little expensive. There was also a rooftop pool, which was the coldest pool I have ever swam in! Literally freezing.. nice pool area though and if the water was warm would have been fantastic. Nice views from the roof of the surrounding buildings.The main issue was that there was nothing to do really immediately at the hotel. You can walk down St Canal St about 10 minutes and you hit some shops and supermarkets, ideal for some shopping or food. There is a bus stop at Union Station, so you can commute for 2 dollars to the main attractions that Chicago has to offer. I would recommend spending a day at Navy Pier, which is easy to get to by bus.Overall I would only recommend this hotel if you want convenient access to the Amtrak Union Station and are willing to get buses to see anything decent in Chicago."
11,199,"May 14 2008 	Clean	Stayed in a King Suite and the room was very large and Clean, close to &quot;the loop&quot;. Not a lot of things to do in this part of town but there is a bus stop close and many downtown buses stop there. So for $2 you can get anywhere downtown in about 15 minutes."
12,199,"Jan 27 2008 	Pleasant Amtrak Layover	I walked in without a reservation in Jan 2008, because this is the nearest hotel to the Amtrak station, and my connecting train was going to be a awhile. What a perfect pit-stop to freshen up after a cross-country train ride!The customer service was excellent! The ladies at the desk were very patient, courteous, and thorough. There is a lounge onsite where I got one beer to unwind after my trip. The wireless internet was smooth. The room was immaculate and well-stocked. Being a single female traveler, I was pleased that there was a security guard onsite.Holiday Inn Downtown served my needs efficiently. I didn't care how much it cost; I just needed to get away from that Amtrak station for a few hours."
13,199,"Oct 15 2007 	Holiday Inn Chicago	Great service, clean rooms, friendly staff. They helped us get around the city, made recommendations for restaurants, and overall were a great help."
14,199,Sep 14 2007	Great place to stay	Just returned from a 3 night stay . Good tidy rooms and great friendly staff always ready to help. Problem with air conditioning unit in room but sorted straight away to an upgraded room.Washing machine and tumble dryer very handy when on 2 week holiday. Swimming pool small but still used every day while sons used gym.Quite a walk to centre but on holiday so good to explore.Extra charge for breakfast but very good.
15,199,"Apr 19 2007 	Rather pleasant	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The staff were very kind and helpful. And the restaurant located within the hotel was wonderful, they make great pizza!Only downside was the location. As a young female travelling alone I did not feel safe walking around the area, and definitely not at night. There really isn't anything or anyone around. I was warned by my aiport transfer driver about this however so I organised a bus tour to get around which was excellent. Apparently the Mart Plaza Holiday Inn has the best location (according to this driver who seemed to know all there is to know about Chicago)"
16,199,"Apr 3 2007 	Better than Expected	After booking on Priceline and paying a low rate for this hotel we were happy with the 3 star accommodations. The Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites downtown Chicago was easy to get to off of 290. The staff were very friendly and answered all our questions. Room was clean and just as pictured on the hotels website but bathrooms are small. Also, Lobby area is small and can get crowded. We purchased CTA visitor passes and used the train/bus service which was convenient to the hotel. Clinton Stop (Blue LIne), is just accross the street. We visited American Girl, John Hancock, Field Museum and Shedds. Found the trasportation very easy to use but will find something closer to downtown next visit. The hotel parking is $30 a day. However, we chose to park in the parking lot next to the hotel and paid $20 a day with in/out privileges. Our room overlooked the parking lot and we could see our vehicle. Also, we were directed to buy our visitors passes at the customer service desk of the Dominicks grocery store that was just 3 blocks away on Roosevelt between Clinton and Canal streets. Parking is free at Dominicks and there is a Walgreens, Subway sandwich shop, and a Dominos Pizza in the same shopping center."
17,199,"Nov 19 2006 	Great Stay	We were extremely happy with this hotel after booking through hotwire and only paying 56 dollar per night! 56 dollar! The location might not be in the centre centre, but its damn close! Walk 10 minutes and you are at the magnificent mile or sears towers, it was a great stay and nevertheless a great location for this price.The staff was very nice and very helpfull. Especially when you think that it was 2 girls bringing 4 HUGE suitcases ALL excessive luggage of around.. 60 pouns EACH. Yes we tipped the man that helped us with loading our luggage hugely. Very helpful people.The restaurant next door is not so great, but a fair deal for a quick lunch. I recommend this hotel very much if you get a good deal on the price."
18,199,"Sep 7 2006 	OK but find something in a better location	Stayed here for two nights during Labour Day Weekend. Very friendly and helpful staff. Room was clean, carpet freshly steam cleaned (still damp), but the bathroom could have been cleaner. I would find a hotel in a better location the next time I go to Chicago. $10 US cab rides with tip to get downtown. Walking downtown during the day was OK (safe), about 15 to 20 minutes to Michigan Ave, but I would recommend taking a cab at night. There are no attractions or restaurants close by (pizza joint attached to hotel, but did not try it - go to Gino's instead). If you plan on spending most of your time in the downtown area it is worth it to find something in a better location."
19,199,"Aug 28 2006 	Never again	I booked this hotel because it said on the Holiday Inn site that it's only 1.5 miles from the United Center....more like 3 miles! Next to impossible to find food near here. Lobby was terribly small.ANTS IN MY ROOM!?! Yes, that's right...I had to fight ants to use the bathroom. Room was by the stairs that lead to the pool, and everytime the a/c came on the lovely smell of chlorine filled the room. Bed not comfortable. Website didn't mention that this hotel is under some renovation and work started at 8am every day. Ugh. Also, noise from the street is extremely loud!I felt like the room was dirty - I didn't want to touch the dingy floor with my bare feet. I paid almost $200 for the quality of a $60 room. Unacceptable."
20,199,"Jul 3 2006	Not bad for the price 	I made the reservation of this hotel blindly through a &quot;name your price&quot; site and they accepted my offer of $100/night. The top floor of the hotel (6th floor) featured an outdoor rooftop pool which seemed clean and well maintained, a workout room and a game room. The location - close to UIC on the very edge of the downton/Loop area was right off of Interstate 290. CTA train &amp; bus stops were nearby which made the location easily accessible. The king bed wasn't very comfortable, but I've slept on worse. My biggest complaint was that the lobby was very small. It was always jam packed each time I walked through. The room was spacious and the a/c worked well. I would stay there again if I could get the $100 rate. At $199, I believe it's a bit too pricey for the quality and location. Parking was valet only for $30. I would say this hotel would be best for families, as it's not far from the mag mile and the wonderful downtown area."
21,199,"Nov 14 2005	Nice Hotel but location is a worry	Myself and wife stayed one night at this hotel recently, the rooms are large, clean and comfortable and staff friendy and helpful but we were not comfortable with the area, we thought our phobias may be due to the fact that we live in a small town here in Australia but after reading other reviews realise we are not alone in thinking the location could have been better. Fortunately it has a restaurant which was too our liking as we would have gone hungry rather than venture out after dark in that neighbourhood. However it is close to the Sears Tower &amp; Union Station. In all the hotel is very nice it's just a shame they built it where they did."
22,199,"Sep 27 2005	Comfortable Hotel	I stayed here for one night while in Chicago and I thought it was a lovely hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the rooms were spacious and comfortable and spotlessly clean. The swimming pool on the roof is fabulous for the good weather and the gym seemed to be fairly good as well. It may be a bit of a distance from the mag mile and if you want to be more central then you should choose a hotel around there. The Clinton L train stop is just outside the hotel and this takes you uptown. I thought the neighbourhood was fine and unless you are planning to hang around on street corners for the duration of your trip then you have nothing to worry about. I would recommend this hotel if you get a good deal on it but if you can get a better deal on something closer to the mag mile, go with that.All round though a lovely hotel!"
23,199,"Aug 31 2005	Great family vacation home base	Just what you'd expect in a Holiday Inn. Nothing fancy but large, clean rooms with extra friendly staff (maybe it's that Midwestern hospitality). Plenty of amenities for the vacationing family like a laundry room, fitness room, rooftop pool (nice after a long day of sightseeing). Convenient restaurant, though prices and pizza were better elsewhere. The hotel is located in a downtown business area that pretty much rolls up the sidewalks evenings and weekends, but that didn't matter to us because we were hardly there. Convenient to public transportation-- Blue subway line is on the corner and Sears Tower, where you can pick up the free trolley to shopping and attractions, is a 3-block walk, plus we had no problem getting taxis to and from the hotel. The free high-speed wireless Internet access was great and for those who don't travel with laptop, there's a computer and printer in the lobby guests can use for free. Very handy for printing out boarding passes before heading to the airport."
24,199,"Jul 21 2005 	Decent hotel but location could be better	Pros: Large room size, comfortable bed, nice furniture, good housekeeping, newspaper delivered to door, vending in good location (near elevators), staff checked ID when paying with credit card, quality soap and shampoo, calming rooftop penthouse (outdoor pool and deck, arcade, exercise room).Cons: Deadbolt in room did not work; receipt put under door essentially looked like a blank piece of paper (must have been having printer problems); noxious smell from heater when I tried to warm up the room (perhaps it had not been used in a while -- it was July, after all); area felt a little secluded and unsafe (a big change from just a couple of blocks away); dripping faucet in bathroom; vending machine did not return my change; traffic noise (busy roads nearby); occasional slight vibration in a wall in room; service at restaurant was slow and haphazard."
25,199,Jul 14 2005 	Clean 	I stayed at Holiday Inn Downtown in June 2005. The location was terrible as it is located at a dangerous part of Chicago. Cabs did come to the hotel but I had some cab drivers who warned me not to wander around as it was reknowned to be 'not safe'.The room was very comfortable &amp; the housekeeping staff did an excellent job each and every time they cleaned my room. Great job!No shops close by. There is only a Dominicks &amp; Walgreens about 4 blocks away. Not a good idea to walk all the way bearing fruits/groceries. Especially when no cabs will stop for you there.
26,199,"Jun 8 2005	Clean and friendly	First time in the Windy City, I was a little bit worried but this was a nice hotel. Everything was clean and the staff were helpful. The little pizzeria/breakfast diner was good downstairs. We couldnt have wished for better for the price."
27,199,"Sep 12 2004	Chicago on a Budget	We took Amtrak to Chicago and this hotel was in walking distance from Union Station. We also chose this hotel because it was near the blue line stop on the &quot;L&quot; subway train. The Holiday Inn room was purchased for $117 on the Holiday Inn web site. This was a Friday and Saturday night stay in July. We felt safe at this hotel and the Clinton stop of the blue line train was at the corner of their parking lot. The room was nice and clean and we had no complaints. They have a roof top pool, but it was too cold that weekend to swim. We arived a couple of hours before check in and they held our bags in secure room. There is not much around this area, but we were hardly in the room for anything but sleep. Chicago is a fun city so there is not much reason to stay in the hotel for the entire week or weekend. Last time we were in Chicago, we stayed downtown but it always seamed like we were walking 5 blocks to get to the subway. With this hotel, the subway stop was right by the hotel.Most of the places we visited was on the red line, and you do have to do a free transfer and walk a block through a tunnel to get to the red line train.We would stay here again because of the convenience of the subway and its price.Also, buy a 3 or 4 day subway pass.Jeff"
28,199,"Jun 14 2004	Horrible Experience!	This is the most unenjoyable hotel experience I have ever had. After arriving at this hotel in late May and discovering it was &quot;on the wrong side of the tracks&quot;, we were a bit skeptical. I felt very out of place here, as the hotel is not nice and is in a very trashy part of town. However, we decided to give it a chance, since we had gotten a decent rate and it was pretty close to the Sears Tower. My husband left for his business meeting there and I decided to wait for our room to be ready, since we had arrived early. Before he left for the meeting, we were told we could indeed check in early and would only have to wait 30 minutes or so in the lobby. So, I told him to go on to his meeting and I would wait. How nice, I though, an early check in....7 hours later, I was STILL IN THE LOBBY! Their computer system crashed, then there was a &quot;problem&quot; with our reservation. The list of excuses went on and on. So, I had the pleasure of watching noisy school groups come and go and found out that our &quot;suite&quot; hotel plays host to traffic school! Dozens upon dozens of angry drivers filled the lobby waiting for their classes to start and stood around swapping horror stories in amongst guests trying to check in. I was not impressed! Finally, my husband and his associates finished their meeting, but we never made it to our room! We checked out without ever checking in and made our way to a nicer part of town! Don't let the pictures fool you. It isn't that close to the Sears Tower. My husband said they walked quite a while, through the bad neighborhood we were in to get there. The W Chicago City Center is a lot closer to the tower and a lot nicer. One last tip, stay on the opposite side of the canal/river that is behind the hotel. This seems to be the dividing line between the trashy/classy sides of Chicago. Enjoy your stay in the Windy City-Just enjoy it somewhere else!"
29,199,"Jun 4 2004	Very Nice	I was given one of the suites at this hotel and was pleasantly suprised with the cleaniness of the room. I, however, thought the pillows shouldn't have been so hard, yet the stay was nice. I would also suggest double sheeting the beds as one never knows who has been there prior."
30,199,"Aug 15 2003	Clean resonable price but a bit out of center	Clean rooms, reasonable price, reasonably quiet - providing you get a room that doesn't face onto the main highway behind the building. Liked the pool on the roof. Its a little way out of the center, but handy for the Sears tower. Well served by CTA metro ($1.5 from airport direct to hotel!) and by Chicago free trolleys. Not much choice of resturants nearby, but hotel cafe OK for breakfast."
31,199,Mar 24 2009 	Pessimo
1,200,Great hotel!	The staff was amazing.The breakfast and dinner was perfect. Saved us tons of money and was perfect for the kids.Great location!
2,200,Nov 17 2009 	Great Hotel right in the center of Chicago	Really made welcome from the moment I arrived. Lobby is on a higher floor so rooms have a good view. I was on the 16th Floor and the room was incredibly quiet for being in the center of a city. You can take breakfast to your room and everything is available to do that. If there was one little defect it would be the swimming pool which looked like it needed to be resurfaced- the paint is peeling from the sides. Every morning while we stayed we went to Swim and no-one else was there. Nice that it is indoor and right on top of the hotel. Staff were very friendly and they also have a great Business Center where you can print your boarding pass for free. Internet is also free in your room. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. It is right by the Hotel Garden Inn if you are comparing hotels.
3,200,"Nov 17 2009 	Superb location everything's included staff was awesome.	I met my girlfriends in Chicago for the weekend for a birthday celebration and stayed at Homewood Suites. I wasn't sure what to expect, but we loved it. The rooms are huge, with a full kitchen, a pullout sofa and a monster king sized bed. Bathrooms are large enough for 3 women to get ready to go out at night without stepping on each other. The staff was great. We dined at Table 52, Art Smith's (Oprah's former chef) restaurant and stopped at Le Colonial one night and walked there easily. The first night we were a bit tired, so simply walked across the street to PF Chang's - who also provides the room service at the hotel. The entrance to Nordstrom is just across the street from the hotel's front door and for discount shopping, walking to the loop to shop on State Street is an easy morning jaunt over the river. All in all, a good price for a nice hotel with a charming staff and a magnificent location. Internet and breakfast are included in the room rate. I'll definitely come back and bring the kids next time...loads of families were staying there that weekend."
4,200,"Nov 14 2009 	Boring but comfortable roomy and convenient	This hotel looks like it was originally another hotel where they joined two small rooms to make each suite. Half of the suite is a kitchen and sitting area and the other, the bath and bedroom. Two TVs, plenty of nearby restaurants, view of the Wrigley building. Breakfast and dinner are included weekdays, but I preferred buying fresh veggies at the grocery store a block away to the comfort food they served. My client got me a great deal on the room given its location and amenities; my &quot;value&quot; rating would have been significantly lower if I'd paid rack rate. Note to light sleepers: there must be a fire station near by, as I regularly heard sirens in my south-facing room."
5,200,"Nov 1 2009 	Felt so much like home...	I visited Chicago with my two teenage daughters. Homewood Suites is amazing. The complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety. The hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop. We got caught in a thunderstorm, and got soaking wet. I dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel! The Homewood Suites was so much like home. The suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. The hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Chicago is an amazing place and the Homewood Suites is the place to stay. I would definitely stay there again."
6,200,Oct 26 2009 	Great Hotel conveniently located	My husband and I stayed two nights and could not have been happier. We had a corner room with a wonderful view. The staff was polite and very helpful. The complimentary breakfast saved us time and money. Two blocks from MM and a short bus trip away from the theatre and art museum. We walked to the Navy Pier and road the free trolley back to the hotel. We would stay here again on our next trip to Chicago.
7,200,"Oct 26 2009 	Poor Service at Valet and at Check In	Dissatisfied with the service upon arrival at the hotel. In the pouring rain, 3-4 valet employees watched from 15 feet away in the front door as my colleague and I unloaded our vehicle of 6 bags, a laptop computer, rolling file box, etc. in the pouring rain. I complained at the hotel 'sfront desk clerk and requested to speak with the manager. Well, it's been nearly two hours since we checked in and no one has spoken to us about or addressed our complaint yet. Needless to say, we are hesitant about any future stays with Hilton and will probably not be uning them and this hotel for any future business or pleasure trips."
8,200,Oct 14 2009 	Great Location for Shopping and Chicago-land Fun	We stayed for 3 nights at the Homewood Suites in mid-August and had a great time. We love the all suites layout- since it provided a nice pull-out couch for our two boys and a king bed in a separate room for my hubby and I. The only poor experience we had while we were here was at check-in (on a Friday) when our room was not ready. There were people camped out all over the lobby waiting for rooms to be ready and the staff seemed frazzled. We did not appreciate waiting for 45 minutes or so for our room- but after that the stay went fine. There is a small indoor pool on an upper floor that our kids really enjoyed. We went there a couple of times and there were never more than 10 other people there (on a weekend)- so we enjoyed that fact. The location of this hotel is great- right across from the back door to Nordstroms and close to many great restaurants- all within walking distance for kids. Bucco di Beppo is right across the street and PF Changs is kitty corner- just for 2 examples. They also have a free breakfast buffet in the a.m. but it was a bit chaotic. They do let you take breakfast items up to your room in to-go containers... so that is what we did to avoid the chaos. There is a Trader Joes 3 or so blocks away in case you'd like to stock your kitchenette with healthy stuff. We will definitely stay here again.
9,200,"Oct 14 2009 	Excellent location amenities	I stayed at this hotel for four nights while visiting friends and site seeing. The location is perfect - very close to the El and within walking distance of all the downtown sites. The suite was comfortable and well appointed. The wifi didn't work in the room, but I was able to use it in the lobby. I appreciated the breakfast. A light dinner is offered Mon - Thursday, but I didn't take advantage of it. The staff were friendly and helpful. Best of all, I had the most wonderful views of the city skyline from my 19th floor room. All in all, a very good experience."
10,200,Oct 12 2009 	Great location. Great hotel. We will return.	Great location in the heart of downtown. Spacious rooms. Full kitchern. Wonderful breakfast and evening meals. Awesome staff. We will return here when we visit Chicago again.
11,200,Oct 9 2009 	In The Center Of It All	This hotel was very beautiful. I went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast. It was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation. The Continental breakfast was magnificent! I didn't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful.
12,200,"Oct 8 2009 	Excellent hotel for family in a terrific location! Great Value!!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel in July with our two small children for our summer vacation. I am a fan of Hilton hotels but had never stayed at a Homewood Suites, it is now our favorite chain. The large room gave us plenty of space but privacy at the same time. Having a kitchen was convenient but between the warm breakfast every morning and complimentary dinner we hardly used it. The hotel staff was great, there was a mix of guests, both those on business and families with children but the hotel was perfect for both groups. This hotel is in a great location and is just a few blocks away from the Double Decker tour bus stop. Next time we go back to Chicago we'll be sure to stay there!"
13,200,"Oct 8 2009 	Excellent stay	This was our second visit to Homewood stes. downtown Chicago. Clean and newish suites with all you can want plus! Very competent desk staff and friendly employees all around (bear in mind this is a very large city &amp; in some places &quot;friendly&quot; is a relative term).Good included breakfast. And LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION--living 90 miles north of Chicago, we try to get there 1 to 2 times a year for leisure for the past 15 years or so. I've stayed in many places there. For a family with teens there is no place better."
14,200,"Oct 8 2009 	Location Location	Nice facility that was perfectly centered for our various activities.Perfect for those who want to park their car and use their feet while visiting Chicago. The staff was very obliging and our only complaint was that they seemed to be overwhelmed by the weekend crowd at the complimentary breakfast,which was quite good by the way.All said, we enjoyed our stay very much"
15,200,Oct 6 2009 	Exceptional Service!	I am a corporate travel consultant and book this hotel often for my clients. My family and I stayed over Labor Day weekend and I now know why it is so popular with my clients!! The hotel is in a great location and the staff is OUTSTANDING. I was very impressed with everyone from the front desk to the server's at breakfast. Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to help. The complimentary breakfast is a great value when traveling with a family. My teenager's loved the freedom to go to breakfast or bring it back to the room.
16,200,"Oct 3 2009 	Great Value	Just back from a business trip. The Homewood is in a great location just off the Magnificent Mile, includes a great breakfast, heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $129. Without a doubt the best value in Chicago for a long, long time."
17,200,"Oct 1 2009 	Rough start but overall a nice stay	A little bit of confusion at first but things settled down and all in all a good place to hang your hat.Checked in at 4:00 PM, dont expect an earlier time. I requested an upper floor and was given the 10th of a 19 story building where you check in on the 6th? I just got comfortable in my room and a couple walked in on me. They complained Im in their room? I called the front desk and they had me checked out rather then in? Well the couple did eventually vacate, after all, I was completely unpacked while they were still wheeling their luggage around.I left for the House of Blues and got back late that same evening. The keys did not work to my room? Went to the front desk and they disabled my keys in the confusion of whether Ive checked in or out. I recommend using the swing latch on your door, because if it isnt for strangers surprising you or housekeeping letting themselves in 5 seconds after knocking you might be caught with your pants down.Now for the good stuff! Excellent free breakfast and light dinner. The location is great; you are only a block away from the EL Red Line that took me to Wrigley Field, museums, the bean and Chinatown without transferring. The rooms are spacious and the full kitchen (less oven) came in handy, as did the grocery store only a few blocks away.Service was friendly and attentive.My front end experience was an isolated case and should not reflect on the big picture so I give it good marks and would come back again."
18,200,"Sep 30 2009 	Perfect location not so clean	First I would say the location is just perfect. You are close to all major attractions, walking distance from everything.Breakfast is great, warm, plenty of it, I have only positive things to say about it.The rooms are huge, there are two tv's, kitchens, etc. The bathroom and vanity areas are so big as well.The bed sheets had holes in them, the carpet had not been properly vacuumed, the shower had a long, dark hair in it that was not mine. Decor: I loved the black and white Chicago photos on the walls, those were outstanding.The bedspread was this 70's, ugly, pinkish/salmon color and it did not look very fresh or clean.The curtains were in this awful striped color.The air conditioning worked great, there were enough towels and toiletries and a hair dryer. There was also an iron and ironing board which was good.The Staff was very friendly, the elevators took forever to arrive. You enter through the first floor and you check in on the 6th floor.The business center has a nice view, is very well-equipped and will print your boarding pass in color. I liked it! You also get free internet access.There is a gift shop open 24/7 that is stocked with food and drinks so that is good as well.The walls are super, super thin and you can hear all that is going on in the other rooms. The freezer part of the refrigerator is pretty noisy.All in all, I was looking for more luxurious accommodations so the hotel did not impress me. But if you are just looking for a place to put your suitcase down and then be out all day, then this is the place."
19,200,"Sep 27 2009 	Sweet Home Chicago!	My husband and I came to Chicago to reacquaint ourselves with this fabulous and vibrant city. We chose the Homewood Suites because of its location, my Hilton Honors membership, and the reviews here on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed! The staff was friendly. Jonah, John and Starr were tremendous, and I felt I knew them because of the reviews here. They did everything to make our stay comfortable. They valet parking staff was efficient and friendly, and I wish I could recall all their names.We had a wonderful suite with a great view. There was plenty of space. Having a full kitchen was a plus, and we stocked up twice on healthy foods at Trader's Joe's just two blocks away. We also enjoyed the complimentary dinner our first night, and breakfast every day. The breakfast is very filling and is just what you need for a long day of walking, shopping and sightseeing. The elevators were speedy. The hotel was clean. The maid service (the only name I recall is Norma, which was the name on the cart) was top notch! They even aired out the room for us.Everyone was friendly, including the other guests. There was a lot of friendly chatter in the elevators.Here's what makes this hotel such a gem: It is unpretentious and down-home, like Chicago itself, but still attractive with more than a dash of style. People feel comfortable here. And the people who stay here run the gamut of types: Business people, couples, families.The location is excellent: The area is full of shops and restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets. We shopped at Nordstroms, Water Tower Place, up and down North Michigan and loved the Apple store there.One more word about the location: It is relatively safe, and teems with life from early morning until after midnight. Chicago is a very friendly city, and everyone who works in a frontline job must have taken a guest relations course. Somebody is doing something right here!By the way, nothing wrong with the parking fee here. It was actually less than we expected. You're in a city, for heaven's sake.We will certainly return to the Hilton Homewood Suites on Grand Avenue. The sooner, the better!"
20,200,"Sep 25 2009 	Fantastic Stay!	My fiance and I stayed at the Homewood Suites for 6 nights this September. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience there. The location is superb! We walked practically everywhere: State street, the mile, Hancock tower, the bean and museums. The restaurants in the area are also great, and there is plenty of variety.I enjoyed having a kitchen and full refrigerator for heating up leftovers and cooking a few meals. The room was fairly spacious for a downtown Chicago hotel. I thought the valet parking was extremely overpriced ($43 a night), and most parking garages in the area are about the same price. Oh well, that's what you get for being in the city. We had a couple of friends stay with us one night and they had their car parked in the valet lot as well. They paid for their one day of parking, only to discover that they had been charged the entire hotel bill two days later. When I spoke with the front desk about this mix up they were not too friendly about my confrontation. I spent a half and hour with them trying to resolve the issue, which should have only taken a few minutes. Overall the experience was good, and I would plan to stay there again when I visit Chicago."
21,200,"Sep 25 2009 	Outstanding Service!	Homewood Suites is a great bargain by its nature. Big rooms, kitchens, bedrooms. A great deal for the price. One might expect that service would suffer to in proportion to the value. Absolutely not the case here. Star pre-registered us and she was funny, charming and very helpful. Upon actual check-in later in the day, Lorena made us feel right at home, she was sweet, knowledgeable and a real professional. Toni was especially helpful in getting us into a very busy restaurant near the hotel - they knew her there and treated us like VIP's. A real treat after a long day of sightseeing. Making sure the entire machine keeps running is Manager Jennifer Kerr. She is nice, funny, and very ,very hands-on in assuring tha ther guest are as happy and aswell taken care of as possible. We give it an A+ and will definitely be back."
22,200,"Sep 24 2009 	Great location extremely friendly service.	Perfect location in downtown Chicago. Walking distance to all major sites. Very friendly and helpful staff. Decent complementary breakfast. Clean, spacious rooms."
23,200,"Sep 21 2009 	Great Location	PROS - Great location, complimentary breakfast &amp; light dinner, free internetCONS - expensive parking, rooms are dated, not so fresh smellThe hotel staff is very helpful and plentiful. The location is very convenient to shopping, dining, and entertainment. The on-site fitness center is OK, but the CRUNCH fitness center is just downstairs and part of your hotel stay. Crunch fitness is full facility with classes, lots of cardio &amp; weight equipment.The first night was problematic because the toilet &amp; kitchen faucet keep running and the freezer did not make ice. I called the front desk about the running toilet and faucet and the maintenance person could not fix everything the first day. The next day after attending the conference I returned to my room to find all my things gone. At this point I was concerned and went to the front desk and was told all my belongings had been moved to another room, last night was comp'd, and please have a free beer from the Suite Store for my troubles.The breakfast rotates every other day but there is scrambled eggs every day accompanied by either bacon or sausage, hash browns and various cold cereals and fruit. The manager's reception is different everynight but familiar with deli meats, Italian cuisine, hot dogs, and substantial salads. There is also free beer &amp; wine served at the Manager's reception. Definitely more than chips &amp; pretzels.In summary, the things that were important to me (good breakfast, workout facilities,location, free internet) were available and done consistently well. I would stay here again."
24,200,Sep 20 2009 	Wonderful Anniversary Celebration	First time in Chicago to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary. Homewood Suites and the staff made it a perfect trip. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Thanks Jennifer and John for giving us a wonderful stay. The room was roomy and very nice. The breakfast was an added bonus. They had a lot of choices to please any palate. Good job Homewood.
25,200,"Sep 19 2009 	Another Great Stay	Another trip to the Windy City, this time in the late summer, proved to be wonderful again. I have stayed at Homewood Suites several times before and this time had friends/co-workers along for the trip. The hotel staff and services, as usual, were great. I've heard guests commenting on the slowness of the elevators, especially around check-out time, but that has never been that big of an issue with me. (Just wait for the next one!) The comp. breakfasts are filling and a great way to start you off on a day of sight-seeing or conferences. You cant beat the location!! The hotel is literally sandwiched between Nordstroms and Bloomingdales! The Weber Grill is a block away as well as many great restaurants on Rush. There is even a Trader Vic's Market 1.5 blocks away if you just want to fill up the kitchen in your room and eat in. I've always recommended this hotel to friend traveling to Chicago for the first time or for return trips. The employees are friendly and very helpful, they'll provide suggestions and even get you tickets for shows or clubs on a moments notice. I will be back again. Love the city, love Homewood Suites."
26,200,"Sep 17 2009 	Lifesaver!	My wife and I enjoyed our mini-moon stay at Homewood Suites. It helped tide us over until our honeymoon to Australia in November. Here are a couple things I'd like to highlight.Customer service - Everyone was friendly and helpful. The front desk gave us a map of the city and pointed out nearby attractions and the supermarket around the corner. On the day of our departure, I realized I had left my wedding band in the room. As we were heading to the airport on the train, we called the front desk to search for the ring. They found the ring and mailed the ring overnight to our address. I would have been dead without the great service. I'd also like to mention that the prompt service, whether providing additional towels or wine glasses and a bottle opener.Other things we liked about the hotel: free breakfast, full size fridge for storing leftovers, one block from the red line, comfortable king bed, and free wireless internet.The pool and fitness center were a bit small with lots of kids around, but at least it was on the top floor of the hotel.Overall, I thought it was a great deal at the price. We were able to spend less on the hotel and more on food.Tim"
27,200,"Sep 15 2009 	Great in house staff . . . But . . .	This review has two parts. . .I advise reading both. Chapter One: The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. The room was nice and clean as well. I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North. Very easy (one block) walk from the subway (Red line). The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. Not just muffins and coffee. You can have a complete breakfast here if you want. And, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. Chapter Two: The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival. The rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. When the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. I immediately called the hotel. They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. I did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .All done? NO. One week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. When I explained the error, I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told &quot;That's not my problem. I can't help you&quot;. . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount. Excuse ME? Now, I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. After a few left messages, I get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . One week later, still no credit. So, I call the general manager again. Oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, I am told. So, please give it another week. Another week passes, still no credit. So another call to the manager. I am told now that the credit HAS been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our &quot;agreement&quot; for the credit, just to appease me. Another week passes. Still, not seeing that credit that was &quot;definitely processed&quot; a week ago. Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago. I told him I will be arriving, and at this point, I want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there. Remember, we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved. I arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was NEVER available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. The only person I spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. He was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of &quot;you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'&quot;. . . WHAT???? Today, my trip is over, and I have flown back home. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT!!! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point. Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel."
28,200,"Sep 12 2009 	Nice Surprise in Perfect Location	My sons and I just sort of happened upon this great hotel. It was a wonderful experience. The suite was great because I am tall and need a king bed, no other kind of configuration works for me. All of the staff members were incredibly nice. I felt like I was among friends. The views from this hotel are just amazing (skyscraper views). The bigger-than-I-expected pool on the top floor is in a room that has even more amazing views of the city. Super, super, super downtown location - central to everything.We loved the included breakfast, and the staff were so helpful and a joy to talk to. If you're looking for high-glam and superstars, you probably won't find it here. However, everything was better than nice. This is a great, boutique hotel that won't break the bank like so many other downtown hotels - and, you get breakfast to boot. Yea !"
29,200,Sep 12 2009 	Great stay loved this hotel	Stayed for 5 nights on the 19th floor great view and spacious room with kitchen facilities.Free breakfast every day and dinner Monday to Thursday the great thing was they provided take away boxes so you could take the food back to your room. Location is very good. Staff are very polite and very helpful would definately stay again
30,200,"Sep 12 2009 	highly recommended	we stayed here in january when it was -20. but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back. chicago is a great town to visit and the homewood suites is the place to stay, period.now we stayed from the 9/5/2009 to 9/5/2009 and enjoyed every day. (p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel, it was fantastic, it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen, (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance, everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it , check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainerbook now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance"
31,200,"Sep 12 2009 	Chicago with a 13 month old	We had a one bedroom suite which was very nice with our toddler. I had requested a crib and had even called the day before our arrival to confirm the crib and ask if it was a portable or a full size so we could bring the approriate sheets. I was informed it was a full size crib. It was a pack n play. Its not that the pack n play was bad, it was clean and put together, but it was not the full size crib I was expecting. The living room was roomy for a hotel suite, however, the bedroom was too small for our pack n play so it went in the living room. Not a big deal but something for you to consider. The Homewood suites is in a great location. We went to the Navy Pier on day and walked there and took the free trolley back. The walk took about 15-20 min with our stroller in tow and the free trolley back was nice but be prepared to wait. The first trolley came and it was full before we got up to the door so we had to wait 20 min for the next one. We drove to Shedd and it was about a 20 min drive but make sure to ask directions. We tried to follow a map and since we didn't know for sure where we were going it was hard for us to get to the roads we needed due to construction and one way streets. Since it was only a blcok and half from michigan ave we walked up and down for shopping. All in all, I liked the location and the staff was friendly. We needed a few things brought to us and they brought them promptly. I was a little concerned when we were right across the hall from the elevators but I heard nothing so the rooms were quiet. My only two complaints were the pack n play and the shower needed to be wiped down again. It just looked like housekeeping was maybe in a hurry."
32,200,"Sep 11 2009 	Professional friendly attentive staff	The only thing I would add to the many benefits that recommend this hotel, is that we experienced an inconvenience on our first day that is likely beyond the control of the hotel. John at the front desk immediately moved us a different room where we were very satisfied. When you stay here, ask for John if you are not completely satisfied. He will make you happy."
33,200,"Sep 9 2009 	Fabulous hotel!	Our first stay at a Homewood Suites, we had no real idea what to expect. We were in Chicago for a few days for 'couple time'. This hotel fit our budget so we jumped in. We were so pleased with it! The lobby staff (luggage, parking attendants) we so friendly and helpful, yet professional at the same time. The Front Desk is on the 6th floor. Again...same great attitude. Our room was large, immaculate and more than we could have hoped for for the price paid. We had a kitchen area, living room area and seperate bedroom with vanity area and then the bathroom. Any thing we could have wanted was provided, any question answered completely. The location was in the heart of the city, which was perfect. I suppose the only con about the whole thing was parking was expensive. We valet parked for $45.00 a day. But then again, even though we checked out, they kept our car for the rest of the afternoon with out any additional charges! The managers buffet in the evening was enough for dinner as we used it one night. There was free beer and wine...and the wine wasn't that bad! Breakfast was well served, plentiful and delicious. Thanks to this hotel, our 'couple time' was great!"
34,200,"Sep 7 2009 	Good location OK rooms	My husband and I stayed here for a week in August/Sept 09.The good points: The location is excellent, close to the Magnificent Mile, the Grand Ave El, lots of restaurants and shops. The rooms are fairly spacious and we got an excellent room rate. The staff were friendly and helpful. The kitchen is fully equipped with a full sized fridge with ice maker.The bad points: The breakfast room had an awful smell about it. The food at breakfast was very average, and they ran out of some things every morning. There was always a massive queue to get a table at breakfast, and there were endless screaming kids about. The room was very dated, and needed to be revamped. The bathroom was small and a bit grubby, and the shower didn't have a lot of pressure. The sheets didn't fit the bed properly and every night they came off the sides of the bed so we ended up partially sleeping directly on the mattress. The bedding also felt very cheap, with what felt like nylon sheets. The lift was slow. The windows in our room were so dirty, you couldn't see out for the smears all over them.If you are looing for a cheap place to stay in the middle of things, this is the place. If you are looking for a sophisticated hotel, this is not the place to stay. There are plenty of other nicers places to stay."
35,200,"Sep 6 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Great Staff Location - All the comforts of home.	We recently stayed here on a family trip to Chicago. My husband and I were traveling with our 10 month-old son and 3 year-old son. From the moment of our arrival our experience was completely positive. The valets were very helpful with unloading the kids and luggage from the car. The staff at the front desk was fantastic. They had a crib delivered to our room within 20 minutes of our arrival. The complimentary dinner the first night was great. After traveling all afternoon, it was nice that we didn't have to try and make arrangments for dinner. The staff in &quot;the lodge&quot; where dinner and breakfast were served was very friendly and attentive, as well. It was nice that they had carry-out containers available to take dinner and breakfast back to the room if you don't want to eat in the dining room. Throughout our stay, all of the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was great. It was like having an apartment, and gave us plenty of room for the kids to spread out with their toys and play. It was nice to have the kitchen, especially for preparing bottles, and for having dinner in the room which was generally carry-out from area restaurants. The hotel has a room service arrangement with P.F. Chang's, and is within walking distance of a lot of nice restaurants. Great location for walking to area attractions - the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier. We are already planning to retun next summer, and will recommend the Homewood Suites to our family and friends."
36,200,"Aug 30 2009 	Homewood made son's Wedding weekend smooth and stress free	The staff at this Homewood Suites made a wedding weekend trip for my family stress free and smooth. We had 6 suites reserved at the prepay rate of $129.00 each for the weekend of August 28-30.  The front desk was happy to give wedding goodie and snack bags, which I made up at home, to each member of our group as they checked in. When we detected a faint cigarette smell in our room when we first arrived, the front desk was prompt in moving us to a different room. They even gave us the largest suite avaiable on our floor, so that we would have a larger gathering place for our entire party of 13 people. Then, Rose, at the front desk, asked if we would like to have our whole party on the same floor. This was great since some were elderly and there were children, also. Some of the many extras the staff helped us with: bringing extra chairs to our suite, fetching items for the wedding from our valet-parked cars, rounding up mini-van taxis for our large group twice, bringing us extra towels and ice within minutes of calling for them. The hotel was sold out for the weekend, so the breakfast room was crowded and they had an overflow room opened, but they never ran low on food. On Saturday, they had a broken water pipe in the kitchen, so there was no hot food, but they were sincerely apologetic.  There was a wait for an elevator at busy times, but we never waited more than a few minutes.  They could have given a little more thought to which families got which size rooms. A couple using a crib were given one of the smallest rooms on the floor, which made it very tight in the room, while our single, senior citizen great-grandma got a corner unit with windows on 2 sides and a very large, uncrowded living area.  We were close to everything we needed at this location."
37,200,"Aug 22 2009 	Good place in dowtown Chicago	The place is in a great location very close to Mag Mile. The rooms are decent, although the bathroom could use some updating. The suites are spacious and clean. The elevator is annoyingly slow but you have to take the good with the bad. The breakfast each morning had a good selection even though it gets pretty crowded. I would stay here again."
38,200,"Aug 21 2009 	Great except when you leave!	Recommend everything about , except when i got home, started get tons of sales calls on my CELL PHONe from Hilton Honors and they were annoying, pushy and non stop. For this reason, I would never stay at a hilton hotel again! Google...you will see thousands of similar complaints against them. SOOOOO frustrating"
39,200,"Aug 20 2009	Wonderful city to explore!	We spent 4 nights at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago during the second week of July and had a great time.The double decker bus tour of the city gives a thorough overview of the city and allows you to get off at any one of the 14 stops. It was a beautiful day and we sat on top outside.Be sure to take the 90 minute Architectural Boat Cruise which explains the history of the downtown buildings along the Chicago River.We were impressed with Giordano's deep dish Chicago pizza which was worth the one hour wait. The Melting Pot fondue restaurant was also a new experience trying 3 difference types of fondues. Bistro 101 downtown was excellent food for lunch.The Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium are gems worth seeing. Take a cab from downtown to avoid the traffic. We booked tickets from our hotel to see the evening performance of Shanghai Cirque at Navy Pier which was excellent. The Wednesday night fireworks at 9:30 pm are spectacular.The Magnificent Mile had great selection in stores for shopping especially Niketown.Overall, had a wonderful holiday. The downtown was very clean and people were friendly. Hope to visit Chicago again."
40,200,"Aug 18 2009 	Highly Recommend !!	Perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile) and restaurants. Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door."
41,200,"Aug 17 2009 	5 Star service at this Great Homewood Suites Downtown!	We stayed here for the fourth time from July 26 to Aug.3 and had a wonderful time (as ususual!). We did encounter a few problems but they were dealt with quickly and joyfully. This suite hotel is fab, but it's the people that work there that make this the BEST hotel in Chicago. Kudos to these wonderful people...John, the assist. General Manager, who took a personal interest in our stay,and the problems we encountered. John, went beyond the call of duty. When my room key wouldn't work for the 3rd time, he PERSONALLY escorted me to my room...NOW THAT'S SERVICE! Thanks for all that you did John, I will always remember your kindness and understanding:DJonah, one of the best bell men ever always had a smile and kind word, he really did make me feel like I was coming &quot;home&quot; after a long day of shoppping/sightseeing. We shared more than a few restaurant reviews...thanks!The wonderful ladies who manned the front desk...always friendly and helpful! No request was ever too big to be accomodated.Connie that worked in the lodge...a smile every morning! along with that free breakfast!. I had gotten a touch of food poisoning one night and told Connie about the experience...she offered to get me some ginger ale to settle my stomache! Connie was working here that last time we were at the Suites in '07...and she remembered us! Suggestion to all visitors: leave these hard working people a cash tip! Yes the breakfast and manager's reception is free, but the people that seat ya and clean up after you are in the service industry and deserve a tip for their service...I know that they even appreciate a dollar or 2! It's not a lot when you consider how much that meal for the family would cost in a restaurant....free wine &amp; beer...enough said!I just can't say enough good things about this place! They really do stand behind their 100% Satisfaction guarantee.Don't know when we'll be back in Chicago but do know that this is the ONLY hotel we would ever consider staying at. Great location. great facility, great food and drink and most of all, the best group of people you'd every want to meet! Thanks for another wonderful holiday..."
42,200,"Aug 15 2009 	Perfect location	The Homewood Suites were a perfect central spot for exploring all the Chicago highlights. We were close by to shopping, the theatre, and plenty of good restaurants. Trader Joe's was just around the corner so we picked up some bottled water, wine and fruit on the first day. The free trolley was a great option to get to attractions and tours near the Pier. The only thing I would not recommend around the hotel is the ESPN Zone bar/restaurant.The free daily breakfast was convenient and had plenty of options. The free wireless in rooms and business center were also nice. Our room was very large, but could have used some updating. We would not hesitate to stay here again on a future trip."
43,200,"Aug 14 2009 	Great place to stay convenient to many attractions	We arrived too early to check in, but staff secured our luggage and we started discovering Chicago and came back at 4pm and had no problem checking in. Room was lovely, complete with stove top,dishwasher, full sized refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave. Would be great for families to cut down on dining out expenses. The full breakfast everyday was wonderful and yes you had to wait for a table, but that cut down on the confusion of everyone wanting to find a table at one time. The lady that worked 2 of the 3 days we were there was very friendly. The breakfast had a huge selection and was very satisfying to get fueled up for a day of walking and site seeing. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful. Three ladies getting away for a girls weekend had trouble getting the cork out of our wine bottle and the valet attendant was oh so nice in getting the cork removed for us! Kind of embarrassing to admit that :). Anyway would definately stay again at this hotel. Everyone was very friendly and helpful with any and all questions asked."
44,200,"Aug 13 2009 	Great location average rooms poor staff 	Stayed for a week last month. Can't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile, Attractions, Tours, Great Restaurants &amp; Night Life. Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. Thought the room was ok, not great. Overpriced in my opinion.Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well.Breakfast was the same stuff day after day. As the week went on, they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery I guess). Also, the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant.Travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. This is roughing it for me...not a camper. Would come to Chicago again, but would not stay here. There are too many other options worth investigating."
45,200,"Aug 9 2009 	food odors!!	The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room(actually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up). The odors from the kitchen were disgusting, and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchen(I.e. hospital). The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable. I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were, that makes this hotel a good value. But i would not stay here again."
46,200,"Aug 8 2009 	Great Hotel. Would Stay Again!	Homewood Suites, Downtown, was great. Toni, checked us in, and she was great. She gave us a room on the 17th floor because my son want to see the skyline at night. They serve breakfast everyday, and it was delicious. Plus, its Free. The staff in the dining room were exceptionally pleasant and helpful. We never ate dinner at the hotel, but one night my husband brought me carrot cake and it was great. The hotel is within walking distance to Grant Park. We would definitely stay here again, and I hope we can go back soon."
47,200,"Jul 29 2009	Terrific Service 	Forty members of our family attended a four day/night 90th birthday week and party for our Mother (Grandmother, Great Grandmother, Sister, Aunt, etc.) and it couldn't have been better. All staff were more than helpful and courteous and friendly. In addition to full kitchens, a full hot breakfast and dinner each day we were able to keep expenses down for everyone. Our hotel contact, Alec Schraegle, worked with us over a year's planning and not only met but exceeded our expectations. Our family has stayed at this hotel for several years and have always been delighted with our choice. Highly Recommended."
48,200,"Jul 27 2009 	Good place to stay	Pretty much ditto with everything everyone else has said. I will add one comment that I think family's with small children need to be aware of. I was sitting on the floor with my 2yr old watching the scenery from our room and noticed that there are handles about 2 1/2 ft above the floor. I turned the handles and the window opened up from the top inward. My wife kinda freaked thinking how dangerous it was. There was actually a sign above it to warn guests. Of course my little girl wanted to open it again, and I told her not to and didn't have any more issues. We were on the 17th floor. Not a huge issue, but definitely something to be aware of if you stay here."
49,200,"Jul 26 2009 	great value for the location	You can be in the heart of downtown Chicago, with a suite and continental breakfast for a little over a hundred dollars. I was completely satisfied."
50,200,"Jul 23 2009 	Awesome! Great Location friendly service! Huge rooms	Been to Chicago about 5 times so far... &amp; by far the Homewood Suites was our favorite hotel we have stayed. It's only a block away from the subway/ L . The breakfast was great! Pretty busy. We didn't take advantage of the Happy hour, but I am sure it was great as well. We had a great view from our Room as well. This hotel has a perfect location. very close to Mag Mile &amp; centrally located in downtown Chicago. The rooms were very clean. full kitchen w / utensiles as well. we couldnt believe we had a full fridge too. Worked well w left over food (deep dish !) and for any drinks as well. Can't say enough about this hotel! We will stay here again. Highly recommended ! Free wi-fi was very nice. also had a (free) full access business center w printers."
51,200,"Jul 22 2009 	Another fantastic stay	Stayed, for the second time, the last week in June and till 4th July. We stayed here the same time last year and had such a great time we decided to return - which can sometimes be a disappointment, but we needn't have worried. It was great. The one bed suite (2 x doubles and a large sofa bed) was large, clean and comfortable (and brilliantly appointed). We found the hotel to be comfy, the staff (door, reception, housekeeping and dining room) are the nicest we've come across in a hotel, the place was quiet (husband a very fussy / light sleeper, and even he was happy). This was the first stop on our USA trip and the little coin laundry was a huge bonus (everything washed and dried, in 2 hours,for $3). Jewel Osco supermarket &amp; California Pizza Kitchen, both just round the corner, kept us going for conveniant, cost effective meals and snacks and the nearby Binny's Beer Depot kept my husband very happily in beer! Chicago is a wonderful, vibrant city and we will return - and when we do, we will definately stay at the Homewood Suites"
52,200,"Jul 21 2009 	Another great stay	This is my 4th time at this hotel, and once again it was a great stay. This time I brought some family members who had their own room. The staff is friendly and never seemed stressed even though the hotel was filled to capacity the night we were there. Breakfast is crowded on the weekends, but having to wait for the host to seat you is a nice touch - no one takes your table and it seems more like a restaurant. This time we had a huge room, but it was very oddly shaped. Get a corner room if you can, they are small, but have 2 windows in the living area. The location is perfect, right across the street from Nordstrom and Shops at Northbridge. The fitness room is small, but does the trick. The only downside is that there is a pool, but no hot tub. There are plenty of restaurants within a block or two. It's not the fanciest place in town, but it is certainly the best hotel for the price ($99 pre-paid). I'll be back again next time I'm in town."
53,200,"Jul 14 2009 	Hidden Gem	We had a great experience from the moment we pulled up in front of the hotel. The valet/bellhops are so friendly. Check-in was a breeze. We had a one bedroom suite with a pull-out sofa. The kitchen was well equipped. Breakfast was great - everything you could think of and they changed it up each day. The hotel was packed but they did a great job of getting people in and out. We never waited more than 5 minutes to get a table. The pool was clean and warm and our kids spent a lot of time in it. The hotel is in a great location - central to the miracle mile and navy pier. If you are going to be there for a few days, get the bus pass - it's worth it. We used the bus a lot. Everytime we had to go somewhere and didn't want to talk, we just went to the front desk and the girls would tell us exactly which buses to take. We will definately stay here again."
54,200,"Jul 13 2009 	Home away from home	My wife and I stayed here for over two weeks in January. I have never felt so cold outside and so warm inside. The staff went out of their way to assist us since we were staying so long. The rooms are good size and the complimentary breakfast and evening reception were an added bonus. Get there early because it fills up fast.The beds are not great, but I have slept on worse. Also, having a kitchen came in handy. The location is within walking distance of many good restaurants and the Magnificent Mile for shopping. We plan to go back next year."
55,200,"Jul 12 2009 	Central to everything!	The Homewood Suites Chicago was a new find for us on our annual siblings reunion weekend. The hotel was running a weekend rate special in May, and it looked nice in photos, so we took a chance. The hotel is in the River North section, and parking is expensive - $34-42 a day, depending on whether you choose garage or valet service. But, the location is worth it, it's a block from the Loop train (underground at State and Grand). And, you can walk everywhere in Chicago from this hotel, which is nice on a wonderful summer weekend.The suite is arranged with a kitcen, dining table for 2, a sleeper sofa and chair is one room, and a king size bed and the bath in the other room. The bathroom sink is separate from the toilet and shower, which is convenient. The kitchen has a dishwasher, serveware, coffee maker and toaster, plus a microwave and a 2 burner stove. And it has granite countertops, a nice touch. This hotel is thrilling all of the little ones, and fitness freaks. The 19th floor has a very nice pool,, 4 feet deep and long enough to do some laps. I have never seen so many well-behaved children under constant parental supervision in a hotel before, which I loved (thanks to parents who understand it's important to watch your kids at all times). There are lots of towels and tables and chairs for parents to relax, looking out over the city to the west. The fitness center has nice free weights, heavy balls and treadmills. If you prefer, there is a complimentaty pass to the health club Crunch next door.The full breakfast is a full breakfast - sausage and biscuits, corned beef, bacon, scrambled eggs, pastries, french toast, cereals, yogurt and cottage cheese, fresh fruit, toasted breads, coffee, tea, juices. They serve the breakfast in a dining hall that is crowded at peak times, so you can pack a box from the breakfast buffet and take it back to your room. No dinky cups, either...everything is full sized, and they keep replenishing the buffet until closing time. Outside the hotel, Nordstroms across the street has great sales, and you can walk inside through a mall to get to Michigan Avenue 2 blocks to the east - convenient on a rainy day. Restaurants in the area offer every kind of food. We tried Shaw's Crab House and Rockit and were very pleased. Be sure to try Ina's on W. Randolph for breakfast, too.Also not to miss in the area are Millennium Park - what a fun place for kids - and the beaches along Lake Michigan. We tried a street fair to the north and had a nice walk after having lunch there. Last but not least, the wireless access to the internet. It's free, and there's a router in each room above the kitchen cabinets. We had to reboot the router each time we signed on - unplug the power for a few seconds, then reconnect it. It worked each time we tried that."
56,200,"Jul 3 2009 	Great location!	This was the first of two hotels we stayed at during the week during NPE Week. Overall, the three day stay was very good. Room was large, very clean, bed very comfortable, free internet, clean kitchen and kids enjoyed the pool and breakfast was a huge convenience. Dinners are provided in the evening during the week even though we didn't take advantage of this. Staff response upon arrival and check in was luke warm, but so were we after an 8 hour drive. We tried to switch our room from a default king reservation to a double, but the front desk wasn't too responsive about our request. They offered a roll a way bed, but we used the sofa bed for the kids instead. I would have preferred they rectify the situation, but I let it slide. Workout room is very nice, but it was 80+ degrees. They also offer a free pass to Crunch Gym next door. Great location! 24 hour business center was a great feature too! I was able to use the facility to print discount tickets to an attraction. Loved this!"
57,200,"Jun 29 2009 	Will stay again!!!!!!!!!	Great staff, location, rooms and breakfast!!!!!We stayed w/ our 15 yr old daughter and our 7 yr old son and had plenty of room in our 1bedroom suite. We arrived 2 hours early and we were able to check in at no additional charge. Every staff member was so helpfull. The ladies at the front desk were always giving us great directions!We can't wait to go back to Chicago and this is the ONLY place we will stay.Martinez family (st louis)"
58,200,"Jun 22 2009 	Just another YES vote	Not much to add to what others have already stated - it's a terrific hotel. The rooms are immaculate and large, the location is outstanding, it has gorgeous views of nearby architectural marvels, it's walking distance from the Art Institute, which for my money is the best museum in the USA. It's also less than a block from the subway, right on top of worldclass shopping and dining, and a 10-minute walk from the fabulous House of Blues music venue.On top of it all, it's quiet as a churchyard so you sleep like a baby in the awesome padded mattresses, there's great water pressure, and no worries buying a snack - even in the middle of the night, as there's a vending area in the lobby. The ventilation is excellent - we were neither too hot nor too cold. The room darkening shades were 100% with no rips or other gaps for light to blaze through in the morning. (I'm a super light sleeper and quiet/dark/ventilation are all important issues for me - Homewood passed with flying colors.)Also! Free wi-fi, which is often the reason Hilton steals me away from my other loyalty program at Sheraton - who wants to be nickel and dimed?The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place five stars is I think $42 is too much for valet parking and the rooms themselves are expensive, at $189 for a king suite - this is before taxes. Also, one of the elevators was broken during our stay and even though we could use the service elevator, there was a 10-minute wait sometimes to get downstairs.Still, the service was excellent and combined with the other pluses of this property, we'll be back for 100% certain."
59,200,"Jun 16 2009 	Great hotel great location great staff!	I stayed in a king-bedded suite for 3 nights mid May and have nothing but praise for this place. The room was extremely clean and had all the comforts of home. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. I was concerned at first about getting a shabby room as has been my experience with a couple of other Homewoods, but they have completed their remodel, so there's probably not a bad room in the place. The location is safe and perfect for anything youd want to do in the downtown area. Ill definitely stay here on my next trip to Chicago."
60,200,Jun 13 2009 	Wonderful Hotel Right in the Thick of Things	We just got back from staying at this hotel and we had a great time. The suite was really nice and it was fun to look out the window and see all the high rises. It was a wonderful location - there was so much you could walk to! We walked to the river and took a cruise and we walked to Harry Caray's for dinner. There was also a red metro right by there and we went to a game at Wrigley Field. It only took about 20 minutes to reach Wrigley. I would stay here again next time I go to Chicago.
61,200,"Jun 11 2009 	outstanding	We stayed at the Homewood suites in Chicago for a quick family trip. I cannot praise it highly enough ! The room was clean with contemporary decor. We stayed in a King Suite, which had plenty of room. We arrived before check in time. However, they checked our bags and parked our car allowing us to explore the City until we could check in. When we did check in, they brought our bags to our room within minutes. Everyone was so nice and helpful..from the valets to the bellmen to the front desk. Breakfast was complimentary and was more than adequate for our family to start our day. Sure it was not the $20 a head buffet at the Hilton, but nobody walked away hungry. The pool had a spectacular view of the city at night. The hotel is conveniently located to everything the city has to offer. The Valets are quick to hail a cab for you or provide information to get you anywhere you need to go. The best part of the service was that when we accidentally left our car key at the valet station when we left ( I thought they gave it to my husband and he thought they gave it to me...my husband used his key to start the car) we called the hotel the next day when we discovered it and they promptly fed-Exed the key back to our house,,,it arrived home before we did !!! The Homewood Suites is going to be our choice in downtown chicago with that kind of service ! ALso the price was right,too. We paid $139.00 for a King Suite. Yes the valet parking at $42.00 is a bit steep, but this is downtown chicago. YOu could use one of the many self parks in the area and save about $10-$15 bucks and carry your luggage about 2-3 blocks to the hotel...but the convenience of the valet was well worth the extra money."
62,200,"May 28 2009 	I'll try to stay here every time.	For the same price as nearby hotels, I got a 2-room suite. Bedroom with king bed, bathroom with toilet and shower separated by a door from the sink and closet. Also a big kitchen/living room and desk. Free wireless didn't work in my room but did work in the lobby. Staff was VERY helpful and offered to have me move rooms but the wired internet worked so I stayed in my original room and it worked great. Kitchen had everything you would need for an extended stay. Great location by restaurants, shopping and bars. FULL breakfast is free in the morning, as well as FULL dinner every evening. I'm going to try to stay here every possible time I visit Chicago."
63,200,"May 24 2009 	Homewood Suites is affordable centrally located and offers great service.	When making my reservation, I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. The suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. Upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. The Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels."
64,200,"May 24 2009 	Reliable friendly comfortable and great location.	My son and I just returned from a 3 day visit to Chicago to visit colleges. We chose the Homewood Suites because of the reviews on this site and also because we had a previous very pleasant stay at the Homewood Suites in Princeton, NJ. The Chicago Homewood Suites is a great place. Most importantly, every employee we encountered was pleasant, helpful and knowledgeble in regards to any questions we had about transportation, restaurants, hotel amenities, etc. (Jonah, a doorman, was especially thoughtful). Our room was spotless and quiet with internet access, plenty of space. The breakfast is excellent and is included in the very reasonable prices. The location is perfect for walking to the big &quot;sights of the city&quot; and also for accessing public transportation. Overall, this quality hotel is a great value and we will definitely be checking out the Homewood Suites in other cities when we travel. GC from Palm Beach County, FL"
65,200,"May 24 2009 	Great location is what makes this hotel shine	Nice hotel. Friendly staff. Decent price for the room is you book early. The hotel's location is great, which I think is the major attraction here. Plenty of restaurants all around: Weber Grill Restaurant, OYSY (sushi), Joe's, Flemings (steak), a few blocks down on Rush is Giordano's. Nordstrom's is right across the street. Michigan avenue is a block or two east. The Red line for the El is just around the corner. The hotel itself isn't what I'd call 'incredible' (a few nicks and dings on the wall, some wallpaper starting to peel in the corner) but it's clean, the staff is friendly and accommodating, the &quot;Welcome Home&quot; is nice (M-F 5 pm - 7 pm), the free breakfast is great because it runs late enough for late sleepers and its a hot breakfast - not just cereal, fruit, and toast. Free WiFi in the rooms. Only negative here is the $42 valet parking. Plenty of parking garages around the hotel but they run roughly the same cost for overnight parking. I recommend this hotel, and if I visit Chicago again, I'm staying here."
66,200,"May 23 2009 	Great Time	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Homewood Suites Downtown. The breakfast is good. It has eggs , sausage, biscuits, cereal etc. Then the managers reception was wine or beer, but they also had food that if you are on a budget could double as a meal. The rooms were good sized. It had a livingroom, kitchenette, and nice sized bedroom. I had a corner room that had a window in the living room and another in the bedroom. The kitchenette had a full sized refrigerator, stove/oven, microwave and a diswasher. The weight room is located on the 19th floor and what a view of Chicago. The windows are ceiling to floor and are an awesome sight while excercising. The had treadmills (2), eliptical and a bike. Additionally they had a good variety of freeweights. Great restaurants are located withing two blocks or less (ESPN Zone, The Weber Grill, Rock Bottom to name a few). Additionally the Miracle Mile is only about two nblocks away as well.The thing that really endeared me to the hotel were the friendliness of the workers. It's apparent that a lot of people are returning customers because the workers were calling them by name and they'd see them again next week etc."
67,200,"May 20 2009 	Loved it	I stayed here while attending a conference at the Marriott across the street. This was cheaper and more comfortable. As other reviewers have noted, this is a gem of a hotel. It's a true suite, with living room, full kitchen, and bedroom. The living room has a sofabed, sitting chair, coffee table and 32&quot; LCD TV. There is a small dining table/desk next to the kitchen. The kitchen has microwave, two burner oven, dishwasher, coffee maker, fridge. Also plates, pots/pans and silverware. The room was clean and comfortable with no obvious signs of wear. The king size bed was also comfy, though not as high end as you would find in a nicer hotel. There is a regular tube TV in the bedroom. The free buffet breakfast had scrambled eggs, meats, cereal, make your own waffles, etc. There is also a dinner with a different menu Mon-Thurs but I did not have that. There is a gym inhouse, but you can use the Crunch gym next door (same building) that is much bigger and has everything. The entrance is not much to look at; just an elevator to the sixth floor where reception is. But the bellman was friendly and the reception desk was efficient and very friendly. It does cost a lot to park here (I think $42/night so don't bring a car). There is a small store next to reception, open 24/7. Free wired and wireless internet in the room. Only minor complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin so if the neighbor raises his voice I can hear it. Also, I can hear water running next door. But all in all I would definitely stay here again. It's much more comfortable and better value than the big hotels nearby."
68,200,"May 16 2009 	best feeling	Just a really nice place, great service, big rooms, excellent value, everyone seemed to be having a good time , loved the buffet meals,"
69,200,"May 15 2009 	Absoulte Gem!	What a great hotel! We stayed here for a week and had a wonderful time. The room was homely with an enormous bed, just the ticket after a days sight seeing. There was a buffet breakfast and dinner included in the price and with free access to a gym and pool, this hotel is incredible value. The staff were really friendly and only too willing to recommend good places to eat and drink. Homewoods was just a few minutes walk of the Mag Mile which makes this hotel a great base when visiting Chicago. I would definately stay here again in the future!"
70,200,"May 7 2009 	A Great Place To Stay	Our Amtrak train was very late and Amtrak put us up in the Homewood Suites for the nite. A very nice hotel and the staff were super nice. The suites had a dishwasher, fridge and a nice flat screen tv. A great view from our floor as well. An unexpected hotel stay but one that we will remember for a long time to come. And the free breakfast was super as well."
71,200,"Apr 24 2009 	Super location with great facilities	My husband and I stayed here to celebrate a wedding anniversary and found these suites a fantastic place to stay. The location couldn't be better - a stone's throw from the magnificent mile and loads of restaurants. The facilities in the hotel are great - there's plenty of variety available for breakfast and they make it easy for people to bring food back to their suites for later (handy if you want to go to the gym / pool first and might not be back in time for breakfast). We popped down for the complementary food / drink one of the evenings also and there was a lovely atmosphere in the dining area with some groups just enjoying a few drinks, others full dinners etc; we were very surprised it was free! The pool was grand though the changing room was small. The gym was small too but that shouldn't bother too many people as you've free access to Crunch Fitness anyway. We heading down each morning and had the pool and gym to ourselves. The pool gets very busy after breakfast though with lots of kids and parents enjoying themselves. There are lovely views over the city there too. The free wifi was handy too. The staff were very friendly and happy to help out when we needed anything. There are no real negatives apart from the fact that the decor was a bit dowdy looking on our floor but in fairness, they are in the process of doing up some of the rooms at the moment anyway."
72,200,"Apr 20 2009 	Great Family Hotel and Super Location!	My kids, ages 10 and 7, are still raving about the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful! We stayed Thursday-Sunday, and enjoyed complimentary breakfasts (which offered many selections, not just continental). We also had a complimentary dinner on Thursday, which included burgers, fries, coleslaw, soda, beer and wine. The location was great. A free trolley just outside the front door, took us to Navy Pier. I would highly recommend this hotel for families. We would absolutely stay here again!"
73,200,Apr 20 2009 	Homewood Suites Chicago is a great place to stay!	What a great hotel. I stayed with some friends and family in middle April for my bachelor party. The location of the hotel is great with multiple restaraunts nearby and only 1/2 a block to the red line train. The included breakfast in the morning is great and free wifi is also included! Everyone at the hotel is extremely friendly and you cannot beat the rates. I will definately stay at this hotel again in the future and would recommend it to anyone.
74,200,"Apr 17 2009 	Great place if you are taking the kids.	This is such a great hotel if you are taking a family vacation. We went on a Wed. - Sat. so we got to enjoy not only the breakfast buffet, but also the afternoon buffet. Our children are 8 and 6. They loved the ravioli and the hot dogs and the fountain drinks. My husband was ecstatic to find beer on tap. (Note that this is only offered Mon. - Thur.) The location is wonderful. We walked to the American Girl Doll store and also Garrets Popcorn which we highly recommend. Staff was always pleasant and helpful. The pool was great as it was only 4'6&quot; in the deep end so we were able to let the kids swim while we sat and watched. The rooms are clean and spacious but I would never call them romantic or extravent. We had a king bed and the kids slept on the sofa sleeper in the main room. Perfect. If returning on a couples weekend, I'd try for a different style hotel but this was an awesome family vacation. The kids had a blast. Directly across the street is a mall with a Legos store.( didn't find it until the last night or the kids would have dragged us there everyday.) Also near the ESPN Zone restaurant and game room. The boys went nuts. Again, would return Homewood Suites on next vacation with the children."
75,200,"Apr 7 2009	Great place for a family trip	My husband, mother, sister-in-law, and I visited this hotel for a weekend trip to Chicago. Checkin was easy. I don't use credit cards, and wanted to check in with my check card. I was able to pay the hotel stay in full at checkin, so I didn't have a hold placed on my ard for incindentals- NICE!The hotel is situated about two blocks away from the Magnificent Mile. We had a room on the top floor, with a great view of the city. When walking into the room, we noticed that the entire far wall of the hotel room consisted of windows, so the view was breathtaking. The kitchen was by the door, then a desk/workstation, and then the living room with a sleeper sofa and flat-screen tv. The bedroom was to the left, and had two double beds. High speed internet was free, and the business center (free) was nice too for printing out our flight boarding passes. Bathroom was in the actual bedroom, and the sink/vanity was outside the bathroom. The water pressure in the shower was great, and the neutrogena toiletries provided were nice. The only things I wish were different were the poor venthilation in the bathroom, and the pretty thin mattress on the pullout sofa. If you're planning to sleep on it, please bring a mattress pad. The pool area seemed nice- we never swam in the pool since children always seemed to be in there, even late in the evening. The exercise room was small but nice- again, one whole wall consisted of windows, so you have a great view while working out. Complimentary breakfast is great. Please get there early if you are here on the weekends. The wait will be about 5-10 minutes otherwise. Eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, cereals, bagels, yogurt, and fresh fruit are always served. One day we had french toast, another we had biscuits. The coffee and fruit juices are great. The staff is wonderful. We had one on the staff members give us tips on great places to eat in the area, and he actually pulled out a map and showed us where each restaurant was. He spoke with us for about 10 minutes about what to see and where to eat, I thought that was so nice. Overall, if you are planning a trip with family members and want a great place to stay, I strongly recommend you consider this hotel. If you are looking for a romantic place for just the two of you, you may want to stay elsewhere."
76,200,"Mar 27 2009 	Made our experience in Chicago wonderful!	The front desk staff, bellman and valet staff were wonderful! They totally made us feel welcome and at home. The rooms were better than expected! Our children enjoyed the pool and the view was astounding! We really enjoyed being in the &quot;middle of it!&quot; It was within walking distance of Rainforest Cafe, Ed Debevics, Hard Rock Cafe &amp; Water Tower Place. We were constantly asking staff questions and they always went above and beyond with their answers. The complimentary breakfast was delicious! This is probably the most welcome we have ever felt at a hotel and will definately be back!"
77,200,"Mar 23 2009 	Great choice with kids	We stayed here for 4 nights recently and had a fantastic trip. The hotel's location is the biggest plus--so close to so many amazing restaurants and lots of great shopping. The free breakfast and supper were a huge hit with our 3 kids, although it was quite busy, especially at breakfast time. However, there was always lots of food being replenished. The pool was a big hit with our kids, and they didn't complain at all about the temperature. Staff was helpful and friendly, the rooms were very clean and spacious. The kitchenette with full fridge, microwave, dishwasher etc. was great! Parking is expensive, but so are all the chicago hotels downtown.We will definitely go back here."
78,200,"Mar 1 2009 	Great Hotel Location and Value	Weekend trip to celebrate our anniversary. Location was great with a wide selection of restaurants nearby. Another plus is that Trader Joe's was within two blocks. With a full size fridge, it was easy to shop and keep items cold. Suite was very clean and well appointed. Fridge with icemaker, dishwasher, microwave, 2 burner stove, Only reason for the 4 rating was one elevator was temporarily our of service on Sunday.Great room rate of $99. - but $42/day for parking."
79,200,"Feb 24 2009 	A great hotel in a great location	We were so happy we followed the advice of other TripAdvisor reviewers and booked this hotel. The location is perfect, and everyone that worked there was so nice, so helpful, and seemed genuinely happy doing their jobs. The room was very nice, and extremely clean. My only complaint was that the walls were a bit thin-or the children across the hall from us were a bit loud. Maybe a combination of both? Also, the hotel website noted 2 flat screen TVs in each suite, which we didn't have, there were 2 TVs, but only 1 was flat screen. The breakfast was wonderful-can't say how much we liked that, and the location was near everything."
80,200,"Feb 16 2009 	Chicago's best kept secret	Hotel was in a great location. Suites were awsome, Staff very friendly and helpful, and Complimentary Breakfast hit the spot. Kev from Michigan"
81,200,"Jan 31 2009 	Awesome location. Very good value.	I stayed at this Hotel for 1 night. We just wanted to stay in downtown Chicago. This hotel is right next to John Hancock building. Walking distance to many shopping, restaurant, and everything else. From valet people to front desk people, they were all very friendly and helpful. The best thing about this hotel (other than the awesome location) is that all rooms are suites. You can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area. You get 2 TVs also. The roof top pool over looking Michigan lake was lovely also."
82,200,"Jan 28 2009 	It's all in the details...	I travel a lot for business and have stayed in every type of hotel from luxury boutiques to chains... and I have yet to ever find such a great mix of service and ammenities as I have consistently seen here at the Homewood. As everyone mentions, this place is in a fantastic location. Anything you could want to do or see is either within walking distance or by nearby public transportation. But what really sets this place apart is in the details. The people that work here do their jobs well- but with the added detail of actually enjoying it. Everyone was so helpful but most importantly - sincere. The suites are fantastic with the added details of soft linens (I have never in my life felt such a soft towel) and thoughtful ammenities. The free food at breakfast and cocktail hour is a great value add with the added detail of take away containers for those that want to eat in their rooms. Everything about this place is perfect. Also - it is great for families - my daughter adores swimming in the very nice indoor pool (with an awesome view of the city) and the food and location make it just perfect for fun family time. We ate at Rainforest Cafe and the Melting Pot which are both a few blocks away. We had a total blast. Can't wait for my next visit!"
83,200,"Jan 28 2009 	Great Deal	Homewood Suites is a grat hotel overall, and the location is perfect. Roomy rooms with full kitchen was perfect. Only complaint I have is that the housekeeping came to our room TWICE in the morning while we were still in the room. Didn't knock, AND we had the &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; sign on our door. I'm not sure what the problem was, but it was really annoying and rude. Overall, the hotel was nice and the breakfast was good. I would recommend it."
84,200,"Jan 27 2009 	Excellent hotel	Very nice hotel. Attentive service. Clean, attractive, comfortable. Beds very comfortable. The pool is a little small and pretty cold too. Would have loved a hot tub after being out exploring all day in December. Nice gym next door that you can use. Grocery across the street and also a mall across the street. Short walk to Magnificent Mile and public transportation. The entire stay was great. What I really loved was returning to the hotel at dinner time with our group of seven (four teenagers) and having a hot dinner buffet waiting. I wanted to throw my arms around the staff and thank them. It was healthy, hot, delicious, and oh so convenient. Would definitely stay again. A big thank you!"
85,200,"Jan 22 2009 	All We Wanted	Free breakfast buffet and free light dinner, great location, capable friendly staff, cheapest rates."
86,200,"Jan 11 2009 	A great hotel!	We recently stayed 3 nights at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago and wow, were we impressed! This is a great value for a downtown Chicago hotel. The location is wonderful. We walked everywhere from the Magnificent Mile, to the Navy Pier, to Millenium and Grant Park, to the Field Museum of Natural History (that was a pretty good hike though!) The downtown trolley stop is right around the corner, and we also got a cab easily one night. There are tons of restaurants nearby. The original deep dish pizza place, Pizzeria Uno, is on one corner , the ESPN Sports Zone restaurant is on another, and the Weber Grill restaurant around the block, to name a few. There was also a good brewery nearby for drinks. The suite was quite spacious with a full kitchen and a large bathroom. There was a TV in both the sitting area and the bedroom. We were on the 19th floor at the end of the hall and never heard anyone else, so it was quite restful. The building has one of the fastest elevators I've ever ridden on! There is a heated pool (no hot tub!) and small fitness room on the 19th floor, and guests can also use a fitness club that is next door. We went to the fitness club one of the days we were there and enjoyed the expanded equipment they had. Our room had complimentary wireless, and we had no problems with the internet connection. The complimentary breakfast was typical of the hot breakfast buffets with eggs, meat, waffles, fruit, etc., but I thought there were a few touches that made it above the standard. The fruit was all fresh, including fresh pineapple, and there were real dishes and silverware, not plastic. There were two attendants who kept everything stocked and cleared our tables. The dining area was large and comfortable. We were there for one night of the Manager's Special (weeknights, 5 - 7pm) and were shocked at how much food was served. It was really enough for a meal, not the light snacks we expected. We noticed several people doing carryouts to eat in their room, which was easy to do with the full kitchen and refrigerator. We had friendly and polite service from everyone we encountered the entire time, from the valets, to the front desk, to the dining area attendants, and cleaning staff. It seemed like there were just a lot of special touches, like bowls of snacks sitting out when we checked in (tired and hungry) and the complimentary daily newspaper. We got the suite for $119, which was an amazing value for downtown Chicago and the amenities it had. The only downside that others have commented on is the parking costs ($38). However, it was pretty comparable to the costs for parking at other downtown hotels, and it was nice to know that our car was safe in a covered lot. Overall, this was a great hotel experience and good value, and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially families who need more space and can cut food costs with the complimentary breakfast and Manager's Special."
87,200,"Jan 10 2009 	Good Value	I really enjoyed every interaction with the staff at the Homewood but unfortunately the room that we stayed in was in urgent need of an update. We arrived extremely early and were allowed to book in. Star from the front desk called us after we have arrived in the room and asked if everything was okay. At this point it was. Went to the dining room and 30mins prior to it closing, there was nothing to be found and the coffee had run out with people standing, sitting everywhere. Perhaps Homewood would consider extending their breakfast hours so the congestion would diminish. Asked the bellman if there was a place to eat breakfast and he recommended Mary's cafe. This is a quick 2 block walk and we enjoyed our breakfast. Later that evening, we noticed that the mirrored closet door was broken, there were stains on the ceiling from former leaks and the tv in the bedroom had such bad reception, we could only watch 2 channels. I'm sure if I had asked to be moved it would have been no problem but we were only staying for 2 nights so did not bother. The Homewood is located very close to Michigan Ave and is surrounded by wonderful restaurants. It is a great choice for a first time visitor to Chicago."
88,200,"Jan 8 2009 	All the comforts of home!	I just visited the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago with my family. I can't say enough good things about our stay! Our room was beautilful and we had an amazing view. The staff was so kind and helpful. The location could not be beat, we were close to everything and right across from Nordstrom! With two free meals during the week the hotel was an excellent value. The breakfast is served daily and offers many options. I have family in the area and I will stay at this hotel again and again!"
89,200,"Jan 8 2009 	Nice hotel - Great location	This hotel more than met our expectations. It is in a nice spot just a couple blocks east of Michigan Avenue. We have two young children (3 years and 4 months) and the hotel quickly sent up a pack and play for a crib. The room was set up as a suite with a nice sized living area. The living area has a couch that folds out to a bed which had clean sheets already there and bedding in the closet. The living are also had a small refrigerator and sink. There was a nice sized bathroom and and a smaller but nice separate bedroom.Checking the Tripadvisor.com review on this hotel we saw poor remarks about the staff. I had the opposite experience. The staff was helpful, friendly, and prompt. They went the extra mile for us even though I booked our room through priceline. This is what I would expect from a Hilton."
90,200,"Jan 2 2009	Only $99!	Had to find a hotel at the last minute due to a change of plan and found this for only $99 (plus tax) on the hotels website. Great location, loads of space in the suite and good free breakfast. Only downside was the breakfast area was very full and ended up perched on one of the stools along the wall. Could have taken the breakfast back to my room though.For the price it was a steal. Clean, friendly staff and great location."
91,200,"Jan 2 2009 	Good Stay for this Downtown Hotel	This hotel is located very nicely in the heart of Chicago downtown.Located one block east of Michigan Ave.There are actually 4 Hilton Properties within 3 blocks of this hotel(Conrad, Embassy Suites &amp; Hilton Garden Inn)Upon getting to the hotel we were met by the Bellman who assured once we got checked in that our bags would be brought to our room.We were able to check in early (10AM) On New Years Eve and were originally given a room on the 19th floor.However, upon getting to the 19th floor we tried getting into the room and the key wouldn't work.We went back to the front desk and found out that someone was in this room still. (Oops.)Then we were given a room on the 18th floor (Room 1811) Nice 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen (which would be useful when the family was here or if staying for long periods of time)Room was comfortable and all was in working order.Internet access was a little slow at times, but all in all very comfortable.The hotel is located one block from Michigan Ave, 5 blocks from the Navy Pier and across the street from Shops at Northbridge.If you want to see famous people and sports figures (I would suggest Joes Stone Crab. (Located right on the corner of the hotel)We saw the Coach of the Bulls, Rex Grossman, Brian Urlachers, Jonathan Toews &amp; Coach of the Bears there during our New Year's Dinner.Oprah and Barbara Striesand had been there two nights previous.The hotel is located one short block from the (Grand Red Line Subway)An enjoyable experience and would return again."
92,200,"Jan 1 2009 	Great Hotel	This is the first time we have visited Chicago but have stayed at Hampton Inns in Florida. The Hampton Inn in Chicage was fully booked so had to stay at Homewood Suites but we were glad that we did as it was a great location, lovely suite with all the amenities and room to stretch out. Breakfast was a plus, you needed to get there before 0830 or there was a queue although you didn't have to wait long. Rooms were clean, very comfortable &amp; staff were pleasant and helpful and there were lots of eating places close by to suit all tastes and pockets. All in all a reasonable priced hotel that I could thoroughly recommend."
93,200,"Dec 31 2008 	Hidden Gem in Downtown Chicago	Free breakfast buffet, free dinner (Mon-Thurs), indoor heated pool, huge suites with full kitchens and separate bedrooms, one block from Michigan Avenue, across the street from Nordstrom's and a block from Bloomingdales, helpful, friendly, can-do-anything-you-ask-for service...what more could a family of four from Louisville, KY want?? We loved it and will definitely return on our next trip to Chicago. Also loved that tripadvisor did all the work for me! No research required."
94,200,"Dec 31 2008 	Loved Homewood Suites	Excellent stay at Homewood Suites. The hotel is clean, room was a nice size, bed very comfortable, location is the best, walking distance to everything. Free breakfast every morning which was a nice plus. Definitely would stay there again."
95,200,"Dec 30 2008 	Homewood Suites Chicago - Affordable Comfortable Great Location	This hotel in downtown Chicago one block from Michigan Ave was perfect for our 2 night stay (King bed suite). The location was excellent for Navy Pier and surrounding attractions. We managed to get a 30% discount when booking so that helped with the $38/day charge for parking. The staff were all friendly. The complimentary breakfast (continental &amp; hot) was great and we really appreciated the to go boxes to take food back to the room instead of waiting for tables in the dining area. The K bed was comfortable in the main bedroom and our children slept well on the sofa in the lounge area (both with TVs). Also had a full kitchen, nice to have if you want to cook (incl. full fridge, microwave, dishwasher, cutlery and crockery). The bathroom was basic but clean. Would definitely recommend for families or anyone wanting a great location, clean rooms and services."
96,200,"Dec 29 2008 	Great value in downtown Chicago	Nice, clean hotel. Bed was comfortable. Nice flat screen TV in living room. 1 BR suite we reserved had a full kitchen. We didn't use it but it seemed to be just the thing for a longer stay. Right across the street is the Shops at Northbridge and Michigan Ave is one block to the east. This hotel is pretty close to everything including restaurants, shopping and night life. Valet parking was smooth. Hotel staff were friendly and accomodating. It was a very comfortable place to stay and I would recommed it to anyone, especially those on a budget who want to stay someplace nice."
97,200,"Dec 22 2008 	The best choice in Chicago	It was my first visit in Chicago for business purpose, I stayed at this wonderful place for about four mos. It's been the best stay in my life in this kind of hotel. All the people are courteous and very very approchable. I very nice room, good food and it's near in almost all of the nicest spots in Chicago.I will never forget my stay in Chicago, i've been in other countries but this is my unforgettable stay.Thank you Homewood."
98,200,Dec 17 2008 	Fabulous Service - the Breakfast Staff is supurb !	I used to stay at the Homewood Suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown. During December of 2007 and this year 2008 I did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if I never left.There is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before. A wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to Chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does!Its a great place to stay.
99,200,"Dec 15 2008 	Hidden treasure in Downtown Chicago	I had searched several websites for a downtown hotel as we wanted to do some shopping prior to attending the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;. I was a little apprehensive about choosing the Homewood, but had a friend tell me I would be pleasantly surpised. I booked two King Suite rooms, one for myself and daughter, the other for a friend and her son. The rooms were very comfortable. The concierge, desk clerk, housekeeping were more than accomodating and welcoming. They appear to make every effort for your stay to be as perfect as possible. The hotel was very quiet in the hallways, even though it was busy. The free buffet breakfast was delicious and was more than expected. If you are looking for a centrally located hotel near Michigan Ave. and would like the best deal for the price, this hotel is it. It does not have the magnificient views of motels directly on Michigan Ave. but it truly is a hidden gem. I will choose this hotel for future use when staying downtown."
100,200,"Dec 15 2008 	Not bad...	The location is excellent, next to Northbridge Mall and a block from Michigan Avenue. Room was a little cramped and there are only two elevators in the hotel so waiting is par for the course. Breakfast was pretty good in terms of selection. Only valet parking is available at the hotel. A half block north is self parking garage which is cheaper than valet. The hotel did not have the correct gift cards for our reservation but the manager appropriately resolved the issue to our satisfaction. Bathrooms showed a little wear. Overall, good choice for its location. Just don't expect the Ritz."
101,200,"Nov 30 2008 	Good Value for near Mich Ave	We stayed here Thanksgiving night since we were joining family at Lawry's two blocks away for Thanksgiving dinner. We booked using Hilton points and called ahead for early check in. Arrived about 1:30 and the room was ready; there was free pink lemonade and snack mix in the lobby along with hot drinks. The front staff was very friendly and efficient. The lemoade was gone in the evening but there was a small store behind reception where you could but drinks, snacks, and souvenirs.Our room was on the 15th floor facing south with a great view of the downtown buildings including the beautiful new 90 story Trump Tower and the back of the Wrigley Building. We're long time Chicago area dwellers so it was nice to see the new addition to the skyline, especialy at night.The living room of the suite had a small kitchenette with a table and two chairs, a sofa bed, and an easy chair. The kitchen was simply but adequately stocked for cooking/dining ; the sofa bed felt &quot;springy&quot; but our 20 year old son seemed to sleep fine. The living room had a flat panel TV; the bedroom an older CRT. The entire suite had interesting art of Chicago architecture.The bedroom was a little small (you had to close the dresser drawer to get around the end of the bed) but nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. There was a single sink across from the closet and the toilet/bath in a separate room. It would have been nice to be able to get to the bathroom directly from the living room but they did fit a lot into a small space.The breakfast buffet the next morning was crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table, but the food was good. The waffle maker had the longest line so that held up the meal. Everything else was being constantly refilled. Overall it was a step up from Hampton but not as good as Embassy Suites. Oddly enough we could smell the 6th floor buffet in the hall on the 15th floor.We picked this hotel because of its rating, and the proximity to Lawry's, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop. The location was perfect; we strolled N Mich Ave a for an hour after checking in, walked the two blocks to Lawry's (GREAT Thanksgiving meal), and the next morning walked to see the &lt;Macy's&gt; windows in the Loop (nothing like the old Marshall Field windows)."
102,200,"Nov 26 2008 	Perfect for toddlers lots of comps great location!	Great place for kids! First, this place was a great value. We booked the park n play package, which included parking ($38) for $139 so it was basically $100 a night for a one bedroom suite. Especially given the location (right in the middle of downtown with great access to all the attractions) we thought this was an amazing deal. The room isn't huge, but was large enough for our family of four (1 and 3 year old) and it's always nice to have a separate room to put the kids!The other great perk to the stay was the free breakfast and dinner on weekdays. We thought the meals would be simple snack type fare, but it turned out to be full meals! The convenience of rolling out of bed and getting a hot breakfast downstairs was great. I figure we saved about twice the cost of the hotel just in food.As others have mentioned, the location is perfect. We took the free trolley right outside the hotel to Navy Pier to visit the Children's Museum. We also had less than a five minute ride to the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium. We didn't make it to Millenium Park, but that was close by as well. The shopping was also great. The Nordstrom's/Mall is directly across the street and Michigan ave is less than one block away.One tip, there's a Jewel Osco less than a block away, great for stocking up on milk and other perishables for the full size fridge. All in all, highly recommended and we will absolutely be back!"
103,200,"Nov 25 2008 	Nice Hotel Hidden in the Heart of the City	Very nice hotel with suite rooms. The staff was very friendly - even on a very busy Saturday stay. My family and I stayed for the night of the Festival of Lights on Michigan Avenue. The Michigan Avenue area (a block away) was extremely crowded as expected for the holiday parade. However, the hotel never felt crowded. The pool was clean, heated, an average size for a city hotel. The breakfast was very good. The service was excellent. We would consider staying at the property again for a weekend escape."
104,200,"Nov 23 2008 	Homewood Suites Great Place to Stay	The Homewood Suites by Hilton was very clean, we stayed in a non-smoking King Suite which was roomy for my husband and me. The buffet served was good, service very helpful. We stayed a whole week and were very comfortable with the accommodations. We loved the free use of the gym Crunch right next door and took full advantage. The location of the hotel is also very good. All in all, it was a really pleasant trip for us both."
105,200,"Nov 9 2008	The best value hotel in Chicago and a great stay	This was a wonderful stay. The staff was extremely helpful , The rooms are especially large, and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy. The breakfast and supper were excellent. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance, they have take-away plates you can take up to your room. the business center, gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in Chicago."
106,200,"Nov 8 2008 	You cannot ask for more	I stayed her for three nights while at a conference at the McCormick Place and took taxi's back and forth. This is one great place to stay in downtown Chicago. A great full breakfast each morning and a nice dinner with wine and beer each night are included in your rate. My room was clean and well kept with a great LCD TV in the living area and another TV in the bedroom. Free WIFI in the room is what all hotels should be offering these days. The shower and bathroom were clean and new looking.Location is fabulous, right across the street from Nordstroms and many other shops. While I did not rent a car and took a shuttle bus from the airport I did notice that parking was over $30.00 a day so I would not recommend a car. There is little need for a car in downtown Chicago anyway.The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is travelling to downtown Chicago."
107,200,"Oct 24 2008 	Wonderful Stay at Homewood Suites	Stayed at Homewood Suites for a girl's weekend in downtown Chicago. The location is great--just a block or two from Michigan Avenue with lots of shopping and restaurants. The main entrance of the hotel faces Nordstrom which is located in North Bridge Mall. Lots of great shopping there and the Nordstrom even has a full-service spa. One of the ladies who was with us had a manicure there and was quite pleased with it.You enter the hotel at the Grand Avenue entrance (there is a valet there) and take the elevator to the 6th floor lobby to check in. The valet personnel and staff at the lobby desk were friendly and professional. Parking is a bit steep: $38/night, but you are in the heart of downtown Chicago.....There is a rooftop pool which we didn't have time to use because we were so busy doing other things, but if you have your heart on soaking in a hot tub, this will not be the place for you....Breakfast both mornings we were there was quite ample: scrambled eggs, sausage, french toast, bagels and muffins, juice, coffee, biscuits and gravy--lots of choices and all good. Also loved the hot water/coffee station in the lobby with decaf and regular coffee and lots of teas plus hot chocolate packets to make your own and carry to your room!Make sure you head down to Ghirardelli's Chocolate Store where you can get coffee/hot chocolate drinks, of course their signature chocolate candies and even ice cream sundaes and other dessert treats to die for. We also took a horse and carriage ride (35 minutes) around Lakeshore drive and the general downtown area. It was a bit chilly when we went, but we had our Ghirardelli hot beverages, plus the carriage had blankets to put on our laps. Filene's basement, home of great bargains, is next door to Ghirardelli's as is a Borders Book Store. Ate dinner one night at the Grand Lux Cafe. Very, very good. It's owned by the same company that does The Cheesecake Factory. I had a peach bellini to drink and chicken lettuce wraps which was a large portion and I couldn't even finish....desserts are amazing: try the chocolate molten cake or the warm rustic apple pie. Lots of dessert choices--go on their website and check it out. They don't take reservations, so if you go for dinner, try and get there about 4:30. We had a 15 minute wait on a Saturday night and were glad we got in. During our dinner, the lobby area swelled with people waiting for a table...If you get there later than 5:00 pm, expect to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour. Hotel rooms have a nice kitchen area/dining room table--a bit on the small side, but we were on the 11th floor and had a corner room with nice views of the downtown area. Living area had a sofa that turned into a bed. Two of us shared the king-sized bed, and then we ordered a roll-away for the extra person in our party. Nice flat screen tv in the livingroom.....room wasn't ready when our party arrived and check-in staff gave us a bottle of wine to compensate for the wait. Everything was clean and having a refrigerator and all of the usual kitchen utensils (especially wine glasses!) and stove/microwave came in handy when we wanted to heat something up or store it for the next day in the fridge.I would definitely stay here again--it was a bit pricey--aside from the parking, we paid about $280 for our room, but this was a girl's weekend and was a splurge for us. Next time, I will bring my husband and two teenagers here!"
108,200,"Sep 27 2008 	Nice Place to Stay with Kids	We stayed at this hotel using Hilton Honors points for four nights in a 15th floor non-smoking king suite. We always like the extra space of a suite when traveling with our two children, ages 8 and 6.Pros: The location of this hotel was great for our travel purposes - it was an easy walk to the Navy Pier, up Mag. Mile, to American Girl Place, to the Hancock building and to Gino's East pizza. There is a Nordstrom right across the street from the hotel. We did take a cab to the Field Museum and Art Institute. The suite was clean, beds comfortable, and the carpeting new. The decor was nice. We had a fantastic view of the Hancock building from our room. We appreciated the large fridge. The breakfast (included with the room) was very good - much better than others we've had at other Homewood Suites. The indoor pool was recently refurbished and sparkling clean. The pool is located on the 19th floor (top floor) of the hotel and the city views are amazing - a unique swimming experience! We had the pool all to ourselves, but it is small and could get crowded... Cons: Housekeeping! Our room was not made up until after 4:00 p.m. each day, and we had to call and ask for housekeeping each day. Very annoying! Our other con for this hotel is that there is just a small single sink/vanity area in the bathroom - we prefer the double sinks at Embassy Suites. It could get a little crowded each morning as we all tried to get ready for the day. Also, there is no hot tub in the pool area - that would have been nice to relax in after all of the walking around we did each day.No hotel is perfect, and despite the cons, we would consider this hotel again for a future Chicago stay."
109,200,"Sep 24 2008 	Its the wonderful staff	Great location,good rooms excellent breakfast(really good choice)pleasant lobby area(Free coffee,juice and fruit for guests)and free use of internet in executive suite)but it,s the staff that most impresses.The guys at the entrace,the dining room wait staff ,the cleaners to reception(Jennifer in particular)all made you feel at home with nothing too much trouble for them.If you want a home away from home then this is the place for you.This is customer care as it should be"
110,200,"Sep 19 2008 	A wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel	My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount. The valets were really friendly, you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street. The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. Our room was very clean. The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants, storing and reheating food. The complimentary breakfast was great! They have real food such as eggs, bacon, french toast, cereal, bagels, juice, milk, and yogurt. The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue. They also have free WiFi. Overall, I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others."
111,200,"Sep 18 2008 	Good location great city	Stayed here for 4 nights without any problems. Hotel seemed clean and was run efficiently. Check in is actually on the 6th floor, but the staff on the ground floor were very helpful and looked after the guests. There is a decent breakfast on offer each morning, although the room can get a little crowded, and there is a lot of walking back and forward to get your cereal, juice, coffee, etc. In the evenings the &quot;welcome home&quot; food and drink is a nice touch, although the beer is a little watery and the wine, well, no comment. The location is ideal, not far from the Magnificent Mile, the Loop, etc.Chicago is a lovely city, I'd definitely go back. But with so many tourists and conventions, it gets a little busy at times. Book your restaurants in advance!"
112,200,"Sep 9 2008 	Homewood Suites like home	We have stayed downtown at many wonderful hotels in Chicago. The Homewood Suites is one we will return to. The location and food are wonderful. It is the staff, however, that make you feel really at home. They couldn't have been more comfortable or easier to talk to."
113,200,"Sep 9 2008 	Perfect Plus	Our recent stay at the Homewood Suites was just about perfect. The suite was beautiful, quiet and nicely layed out. We were there for the weekend, for a wedding, so we did not use the kitchen but it was nice to have.The full breakfast was just wonderful and very ample. Plus coffee and goodies were available all day long.The location is superb, walk out and you're in the thick of things. Everyone was friendly, helpful and available. It's a hidden gem but not too hidden as it was voted #1 Homewood Suites in America. We loved it."
114,200,"Sep 4 2008 	Great Location	I read the review on trip advisor before booking at the Homewood suites. Was very pleased with location, and the room. Location was within walking distance to all attractions, and did not have to take a taxi. Able to walk to navy pier, magnificent mile, theatre district, and milenium park. Booking online saved money, as well as free breakfast and dinners during the week. Allowed more money for shopping!!"
115,200,"Sep 4 2008 	So many positives but need redecoration	We stayed midweek for 3 nights - 2 Adults &amp; 2 children. It was our second stay in 12 months.What's good - our children enjoyed the pool, large suites with a tv in the bedroom and also the living area which meant we didnt have to watch disney when taking time out. Buffet breakfast is included in the price - we only had to wait one morning for 5 mins for a table. Staff varied from very helpful to business-like with no bad experiences. The location was ideal for us and the free blueline trolley stops beside the hotel. There's two grocery stores located very close and also some great restaurants. What's bad - the rooms need to be redecorated esp replacing the carpets - my feet were dirty after being barefoot for a couple of hours in the suite, we found fingernail clippings when searching for children's toys before checking out and none of us cut our nails during our stay. Otherwise all other surfaces in the suite were perfectly clean. We will go back but only if we cant find an alternative to tick all the boxes in the pros listed above. 12 months ago I would have given Homewood a 4/5 rating but only a 3 this time solely because of the carpets."
116,200,"Sep 2 2008 	Ok Stay Customer Service needs work	We recently stayed one night (August 30th) at this hotel. Overall, the room was nice but the customer service needs some work. The hotel is not much more than a 3 star hotel for sure. It COULD be with a better staff. Nobody was extremely helpful and nobody smiled.The only good thing about the hotel is their complimentary breakfast in the morning and the location is pretty nice. There are several dining options right near the hotel. The redline service is right outside the hotel, but it was out of order under contruction. Be ready for a long wait at the elevators! I read reviews about this and they are absolutely true! The hotel is about 19 floors and there were only 2 elevators side by side. It was Labor Day weekend, so the hotel was very busy which I'm sure didn't help.It seemed like a good hotel for families with children because there were LOTS of them. :) We were not one of those, so we might have been happier staying some place a litte bit more expensive.But for one night in the city it was OK. I don't think I would be very excited to go back again though."
117,200,"Sep 2 2008 	Nice Stay over Memorial Weekend	Stayed over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites, 2 rooms. Great Hotel, we always love breakfast in morning,and drinks in even when applicable. Around the corner from magnificent Mile,and close to lots of restaurants. Staff was great, we even checked in early before noon,and other room available less than hour later. Fresh fruit was available to us,and bell guys are cool. Suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here, house cleaning kept our room clean,and we felt safe!"
118,200,Aug 30 2008 	Always love a homewood suite	I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights. The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating(but kids don't care) My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect
119,200,"Aug 29 2008 	Great location and price for a family!	We selected Homewood Suites after looking over all the hotels and searching for convenience, family friendly &amp; value.This hotel had all 3! Right near the bus &amp; rail stations (even though the rail was out of service due to construction). Loved the breakfast in the morning and wonderful price. Kids loved the pool and it was never too busy.We would definitely stay here again!"
120,200,"Aug 28 2008 	Loved Homewood Suites by Hilton	This was my first trip to Chicago &amp; I wanted it to be the best it could be. Since I was going to sightsee I didn't want to spend all the extra money on food so I figured homewood suites was the way to go. After reading all the wonderful reviews I was very excited to have the experience. As soon as we pulled up to homewood suites the valet service was there getting our bags and taking our car to the parking garage. The staff was VERY friendly and called up immediatly to see if our room was ready. Since it wasnt they held our bags so we could go see the city. When we got back to the hotel we were checked in quickly and our bags were brought to us. The room was amazing &amp; had an amazing view. The room was AMAZING but I would have to say that Homewood Suites main star quality is their staff. You will not find a better staff. They were so helpful in our planning and directions. Our last night there I wanted to take a carriage ride. We called down to the front desk and within 10 minutes they had a horse and carriage there to pick us up. This hotel has moved up from #4 to #3 since my stay there. In no time this hotel should be the #1 hotel in Chicago. Very afforadable, great location, great staff. I LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!!"
121,200,"Aug 27 2008 	Great Location	We just spent a week at the Homewood, with two children (3yrs and 4mos). The location is great, literally one block from Magnificent Mile. It is a short 3 block walk to the bridge and only about 15 minute bus ride to Lincoln Park. Since we had a stroller and the stairs up to Mag. Mile were tricky, I recommend going through the Nordstrom across the street or walking to Rush, north 1 block and over. It is very quick. If you are going anywhere on public transportation, note that the Redline is closed at night for construction, this made getting back from US Cellular a bit tricky. The property was great with helpful employees, although they didn't always know the 'best way' to get to some locations, just do your own homework. The rooms were clean, but the carpet and such are probably ready for replacement. The pool is not kid friendly as it does not have a shallow/step area and there is not a hot tub. The breakfast was nice, but did get very crowded around 8:30 and you will need to wait for a table."
122,200,"Aug 27 2008	Wonderful Chicao Hotel	This hotel has an excellent location for walking Chicago's downtown, pier, etc.Mon-Thurs. they offered a wonderful early evening free light dining.Our room had a separate bedroom, extremely clean and quiet.The breakfast was outstanding."
123,200,"Aug 23 2008 	Great Time Great Location would come back to Homewood Suites	I read all the reviews for this and other hotels and once i made my selection i was very pleased to see that all the reviewers were right on about tis hotel. We stayed 7 nights and we loved it. we have a 3 year old and it was such a nice place for kids. my son saw another boy at the pool and at breakfast {awesome spread} and dinner the 4 nights it was served. made it fun for him. We took the cab from the airport as someone suggested $41 with tip. You could take the blue line to Jackson, then transfer to the red-line and get off at grand $2. station is 1.5 blocks from the hotel and lots of people do it. Not scary to travel downtown at all. DO NOT rent a car if you are only going to be downtown and do the tourist stuff. Get a 3 or 5 day CTA card from the grocery store around the corner, get the city-pass well worth it also. There are free shuttles that run all over, the hotel has maps, but the trains and buses are so easy,and less crowded then the free trolley, they also run later. Get the card, i promise you will be glad you did. Grocery around the corner has everything you need if you want to cook in the room. Great great breakfast you can take to the room if you want, mon-thurs dinner is good. beer and wine are served and there is a soda machine so it saves lots of money. if you order UNO's call ahead 1 hour then go pick up the pizza, eat in the room not worth waiting for one of 12 tables. No complaints at all. I found all the travel advice on this site right on and helpful. I hope this helps you. We will go back there. You can't go wrong and the staff is SUPER!"
124,200,"Aug 19 2008 	Best kept secret in Chicago	This was our first trip to Chicago and we were a little hesitate about staying downtown. We parked in front of the hotel and the attendants valet parked our car and we went up to the 6th floor to check in. The check-in was quick, we went to our room on the 11th floor and was very pleased to see a really beautiful room with kitchen, table and chairs, a sofa and nice flat screen TV.The bedroom was a separate room with wonderful bedding and many pillows and another large TV. Breakfast was above and beyond for a free meal and then to our surprise they provided a free dinner which was buffet style and offered several choices.The location was very convenience, right out front was the trolley and bus stop but it was only a few blocks to the river, easy walk.For $189.00 this hotel exceeded our expectation's."
125,200,"Aug 17 2008 	Convenient location for exploring downtown Chicago	We recently enjoyed a 3 night stay (Thurs. thru Sat.) at this conveniently located property. Our 9th floor suite included a bedroom with king size bed, a sitting room with a sofa bed,and a kitchen. The room was cheerfully decorated and airy. The views outside the the two large windows was good. We were surrounded by skyscrapers-a pretty view at night. The bathroom was of average size; but lacked vanity space. Only one sink and mirror &amp; no extra shelves to put toiletries. This can be less than ideal if the bath will be shared. It would have also been nice to have a few extra washcloths &amp; hand towels-we kept running out. There are an abundance of interesting restaurants and shopping areas nearby (Nordstrom &amp; Bloomingdales), as well as a movie theater. We especially enjoyed the Melting Pot (fondue) &amp; Big Bowl (Asian)restaurants. We were able to walk to our sightseeing boat tour departure point at the Michigan avenue bridge. Also walked to Macy's. We took the free shuttle right outside the hotel to the Navy Pier as it looked like a bit of a walk.(the shuttle can get very crowded on weekends) On the morning of our departure we received very prompt &amp; pleasant service from the bellman who retrieved our luggage &amp; held a taxi for us."
126,200,"Aug 12 2008 	Great Experience	My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July, 08. We had (3) 1 bedroom suites. Great Location in downtown Chicago. Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. I recommend going early. The rooms were quiet and clean. I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying &gt;2-3 days. We would stay here again.Parking is expensive, about $28/day. It is valet. The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly.This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites (3 different cities). I have had a great experience each time."
127,200,"Aug 11 2008 	Great Stay! Ideal Location and Friendly Staff!	We stayed at the Homewood for two nights on a quick but lovely trip to Chicago. When we arrived, the staff were super friendly and very helpful. We arrived early and our room was not quite ready, but the staff offered to keep our bags for us while we went for lunch. Before we could even catch the elevator downstairs (the reception is on the 6th floor), they called us to tell us our room was ready. Great people and very easy check-in. The room was spotless and bigger than we expected! It was perfect and had everything you would need. The best part about the room was the BED! It was surprisingly the most comfortable bed we've slept in!Great location - very close to Magnificent Mile and not far from the Chicago Theatre. A nice walk to Navy Pier and just steps to the red subway line that takes you to Wrigley.We will definitely stay here again - highly recommended."
128,200,"Aug 4 2008 	Excellent value great experience	Just got back from an overnight at Homewood Suites. We live only 90 minutes away from Chicago so have stayed many many times at the hotels right on Michigan Avenue. This time I shopped around a little and found Homewood Suites and holy cow, what a great value and a great place to stay. It was at least $100 less than the hotels I've stayed at on Michigan Avenue plus we had a suite with a full kitchen and bedroom and this also included breakfast and not just a continental breakfast, a full breakfast of bacon and eggs, hash browns, french toast, fresh fruit, juice, rolls, etc. Really, for the price you cannot go wrong. My 25-year-old daughter and I stayed here over the weekend. She travels a lot for business into Chicago and she said she would highly recommend Homewood Suites to her collegues. Our room was very clean, the kitchen utensils were clean (I checked them all out and am very picky) and the bathroom was huge. The staff were very friendly. The hotel is one block off of Michigan Avenue and close to every place you would want to go for shopping, tourist activities, etc. I would suggest you take the trolley or taxi to Navy Pier as it is a pretty long walk. I will be heading into the city next month and will definitely be staying at Homewood Suites."
129,200,"Aug 2 2008 	Great hotel. Good location.	This is a nice hotel in an excellent location. Everywhere is easy to get to, Michigan Ave is about 5 mins walk. The Red Line, Grand station about the same.The hotel itself is clean, the rooms are pleasant. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and living area. Our son used the sofa bed in the living area, he said it was comfortable. There were two T.Vs, a kitchen area with fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher and two electric rings.The breakfast had a good choice of things, although the room was a little small when the hotel was busy at the weekend, we had to wait for a table. There were containers provided to take breakfast to your though. The breakfast staff are very friendly and polite.There is a dinner with drinks in the evenings, Mon-Thurs. We ate out mostly though, but it seemed popular with people with young children.Only one slight complaint, the lifts are painfully slow, there are only two and at busy times you seem to be waiting a long time. Overall I liked this hotel and I would stay there again."
130,200,"Jul 25 2008 	Good Stay Great Location Good Price	We spent 4 nights at the Homewood Suites in early July. We we very satisfied with the Hotel, and would recommend it to others who are looking for a good value, a great, centrally located hotel which is close to all attractions, a clean hotel, and friendly service.-Rooms - We had a 1 Bedroom suite (2 of us) - it was roomy and clean. We paid $145 per night, which we considered to be a very good value -Service - The staff was friendly and accomodating. We could not reserve a non-smoking room on-line (sold-out), but when I called 3 days before my trip, the desk manager had no problem blocking a specific room for us to ensure that we got what we wanted.-Food - Breakfast and dinner were included. Breakfast was your standard Homewood fare - eggs, french toast, sausage, bacon, cereal, bagels, etc. A good way to start the day. We did not eat dinner at the hotel (if you aren't on a strict budget, I cannot see eating at the hotel when Chicago has so many great restaurants), but it was full every night. We did help ourselves to beer and wine, which we brough back to our room for an early evening break.-Location - A fairly quiet street, only 1 block from Mag Mile, and right in between Rush and Wabash. We walked everywhere (even all the way up to Linoln Park). Restaurants, theater, stores, the lake are all very close and easy to get to. The Red-line El is 1 block away. Cabs are easy to get.-Restaurants nearby - Joe's Steakhouse, Weber Grill, Rock Bottom Brewery, PF Chang's, Gioprdano's Pizza, Unor's, Due, lots more - all within 2 blocks.All-in-all, a good place to stay. Not the lap of luxury, but a good hotel that I would recommend to anyone."
131,200,"Jul 23 2008 	Nice Place To Stay In A Hectic City	I found the hotel to be a nice positive surprise. Located only about two blocks from one part of Michigan Avenue, it is close to shopping and dining.Enter the front and go up six floors to registration. The room that I had on the 18th floor had a decent view for a city hotel. Of course one can always hear the sounds of the city, even on the 18th floor. Sirens are not uncommon during the day and early evening, and the sounds of traffic are there during &quot;rush hour&quot;.My room was clean and comfortable, and of course it was a suite. Good size flat screen TV in living area with &quot;regular&quot; TV in bedroom. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was equipped with a dish washer, microwave, fridge, coffee maker and a desk for working. Internet access is free, breakfast is free, cocktails and soft drinks are free in the early evening just as it is at Embassy Suites, but this hotel offers free dinner. However, one must choose the entree and complimentary side dishes chosen by the hotel and changed daily. Don't expect to get a burger and fries here, unless it is Burger &amp; Fry night. While I was there for two nights we were offered fish night and China buffet night. The food is what one would expect at a buffet style offering. I was there to attend a trade show at the McCormick Place Convention Center which is about a $10-$12 cab ride at this writing. I would stay at this hotel again if in the area again."
132,200,"Jul 21 2008 	Recommend This Hotel	We enjoyed this hotel for our recent vacation to Chicago. We chose this hotel because we had had a good experience in a Homewood Suites before (and we wanted a separate bedroom so that our baby could sleep without the rest of us having to sit quietly in the dark!) and we were not disappointed. Our room was very quiet considering the hotels downtown location. We had a great view of the city and some interesting architecture from our hotel room. The hotel was only about a block from the red line which made using public transportation convenient. The free summer trolley to navy pier stopped right outside the hotel. Unfortunately, we never got to use this, but it would have been fun if we had had more time. The exercise room and pool were pretty nice. The pool was heavily chlorinated and not great for small kids (pretty deep). The hotel also offers free guest passes to the gym next door, but we didnt get a chance to try that out, either. The breakfast was good, but very crowded. They had someone seating you, which made it seem nicer. The hotel staff members we interacted with were all very friendly. The hotel was a large chunk of our vacation cost, but we felt it was worth it. The hotel is also near some interesting restaurants like Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due and the Weber Grill restaurant (which we didnt get a chance to eat at, but looked interesting). We wanted to eat a Pizzeria Uno (only about a block away from our hotel), and it worked out well because the wait was 1-2 hours on Saturday night, so we just called to order and waited in our hotel room until the pizza was ready."
133,200,"Jul 14 2008 	Couldn't ask for better service!	Wow. We had such an excellent stay. The rooms were enormous and exceedingly clean. The front desk staff was incredibly accommodating, anticipating our needs. We were delighted to find that the hot breakfast was yummy and that dinner was provided (with free wine and beer). The location was just incredible. The bellman was helpful. I can't think of anything I would change to be honest. Next time I go to Chicago, I won't even consider another hotel! Oh, Texas de Brazil opened up in the same building as the hotel and the scrumptious odors permeated the elevator. Needless to say, we stayed hungry! LOL"
134,200,"Jul 13 2008 	Great hotel plenty of space nice breakfast	We stayed over the July 4th weekend. The room was spacious for a downtown property, including a kitchen with stove, full size fridge, sink and dishwasher! The rate included breakfast, which was very nice for an inclusive breakfast, several hot items, many pastries, cereals and fruits. The pool was located on the top floor, and although a bit small, kept the children happy. However, there was very limited seats - about 8 total! We were a healthy 15 minute walk to shopping, but the doormen were very attentive and we were able to get a taxi quickly. We did not use the valet parking, which at $38/night is a bit steep. We had a relative who let us use her parking pass down the street."
135,200,"Jul 8 2008 	Great Location!	We stayed here for a girls weekend for the 4th of July holiday. The Homewood Suites is wonderful! Loved the FREE breakfast buffet; a different daily selection of hot breakfast items including potatoes, sausage, pancakes, french toast, eggs, etc. and several cold items like yogurt, fresh and cut fruit, juices, etc. Staff was friendly and helpful. FREE trolley to the Navy Pier right outside of hotel. Room was clean, ran out of towels and needed mouthwash; someone came right away with the items. Valet parking and bellhop staff wonderful, very kind! Hotel is in great location within walking distance of many restaurants, magnificient mile, grocery stores, etc. Would stay here again!"
136,200,"Jul 7 2008 	Fantastic location!	Location....location....location! The Homewood is the best hotel to stay in Chicago. It is a suite style hotel so we had a kitchen, living room and bedroom. Perfect for the family. Very clean and comfortable rooms. Staff is excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Quiet rooms for Chicago! Excellent restaurants within walking distance not to mention the shopping. Navy Pier a quick trolley ride from the hotel. We even walked to Millenium and Grant Parks. Buses are very accessible also. Pizzeria Uno just a block away but order it to go and eat in your room. Very small restaurant and congested with long lines. Take out was very easy and convenient. We rented a movie in the room while eating the pizza. Kids loved it! Harry Caray's, Weber Grill, Joes Stone Crab, and several cafes are close by. Recommend the Water Tower Place for shopping. Taste of Chicago is excellent if you happen to be in town that week. We absolutely loved it! We have stayed at other hotels in Chicago, but this one wins! We will definitely stay here again!"
137,200,"Jul 5 2008 	Location Location Location	We spent 3 nights at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. When we arrived our room wasn't ready. They held our bags at the valet area and brought them up promptly when our room was ready..which only took about 30 minutes. Our room was very nice. The suites are great with kitchenette, living area, dining table, bedroom and separate sink area from the bathroom. Our room was very clean with the exception of mildew on the grout in the bathroom. With the products available now, there should be no mildew in bathrooms at hotels. It's just too easy to take care of these issues now. The hotel is right on the line for the free blue trolley to the Navy Pier. It's only about a 6 block walk so we didn't take advantage of the trolley...but we do tend to walk a lot. One block west of the hotel on E. Grand and N. State is the Grand Plaza Market. It's a small supermarket. We were able to get supplies for the room there. Prices were only about 5% higher than what we were used to at home, so not bad at all. They have a pharmacy, groceries, toiletries, etc. ESPN Zone is around the corner in the same building. Bloomingdales is around the corner as well. Easiest way to Michigan Avenue is to walk west on E. Grand, turn left on N. Rush then right on E. Ohio. Boom...Michigan Avenue in all it's glory.The location is just unbeatable!"
138,200,"Jun 28 2008 	Very good if suite's are your thing.	This is not a well-known hotel in Chicago, but it's really interesting.The location is ideal for just about any purpose: just off the magnificent mile, a blockfrom the red line subway and a few blocks from the El.The hotel is not super-noticeable from the street; the entrance ison street level but the hotel lobby is 6 floors up on theelevator.The rooms are not just suites, they're really large suites -- witha well-equipped kitchen, a living area with sofa and bath, and a bedroomwith full private bath. They have nice views of the city andare well-equipt (big screen tv in the living room, largetv in the bedroom).One thing that's a bit strange about the place in thisage of niche-marketing is thatit caters both to budget-conscious tourists with large familiesand to business travelers on long-term stays who are usingsomebody else's money.So on the one hand they have wifi and internet in the rooms,and an enthusiastic full-service business-savvy front desk; on the other hand, theyhave a mini-market that has basic cooking staples, and theyhave a *coin laundry* (try finding that in a Marriott Courtyard!).During my stay, they managed to cater to both groupsquite well.My only minor complaint was about breakfast --yeah it's complimentary, and they have a lot of staff on handto try to make it run smoothly. But it brought back bad memoriesof summer camp: mobs of people pushing into a tiny serving room to scoop out something from an industrial-scale vat ofscrambled eggs. They have a dining area, but it's much too small for a hotel this size, particularly given that the breakfastperiod is fairly brief."
139,200,"Jun 25 2008 	Two thumbs up to Homewood Suites	My wife and I returned home today from Chicago. We stayed at the Homewood Suites for five days. The service was amazing. We were a little early arriving so the door man stored our luggage until it was time for us to check in. The door men were very helpful. They informed us of great restaurants and the best way to get where we were going. The breakfast was good. We had some problems with one of the hostess on one morning. She was a little unfriendly. Other than that all was well. There was plenty of food to choose from and it was decent quality.Wasn't into the Manager reception. We always had plans so it was not an option for us. We walked by one night and there was several people taking advantage of the free meal. The room was nice. We had a great view looking South. We were on the 17th floor. From our room we could see the Sears Tower, United Center, and Trump Tower to name a few. I got to see a lot of construction going on over at the trump tower. The Trump Tower is one of the coolest buildings I have ever seen. Having a kithchenette was awesome. We had a pizza from Giordanno's delivered the first night. We ate half and put the rest in the fridge for the next day. So on the third day, we had a pizza from Gino's East delivered and did the same. By the way, we thought that Giordanno's was the better of the two. For the most part, everyone was friendly at the HWS. It really made our stay enjoyable."
140,200,"Jun 18 2008 	magnificent stay near Magnificent Mile	Homewood Suites has got it all: great location for restaurants, shopping and attractions,comfortable suites,free breakfasts and internet,friendly staff,etc. A super place to stay in Chicago."
141,200,"Jun 16 2008 	excellent downtown hotel	This is one of my favorite downtown Chicago hotels in its price range (~ $200/night on the weekend). PROS:* The rooms really are suites (with a door you can close to separate the bedroom from the living area).* The living area has an HDTV, with hookups for laptops if you're hosting a small business meeting in your room.* There's a nice kitchenette complete with stove, fridge &amp; sink (great if traveling with kids)* The free breakfast buffet was excellent. * All of the staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful.CONS:* The only negative thing I can say isn't really even a big deal at all, but I'll note it anyway... even though the room comes with an HDTV, there's no HDTV content. For example, instead of ESPN HD, you get standard-def ESPN stretched to fit the bigger screen."
142,200,"Jun 15 2008 	Excellent accommodations very friendly staff!	We stayed for 4 nights Tuesday through Friday and we loved absolutely everything about our time here. The hotel is in a superb location, less than a minutes walk to the subway and only a few minutes walk to the magnificent mile. The hotel offers free breakfast everyday and free dinner Monday through Thursday. The hotel staff is very friendly and polite and its nice to see a place where everyone is willing to help out. They had a security guard deliver extra towels to our room. The fact that security is willing to help out guests really says alot about this place. Overall I highly recommend this hotel to all who are traveling to Chicago. You wont be disappointed with your stay."
143,200,"Jun 12 2008 	Highly recommended	The location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to Navy Pier is just beside the hotel. The room was very spacious. Kind of too big for a solo traveler. The view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. The bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe.The kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. Some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty, probably because they had not been used for sometime. However, the microwave oven was very useful as I can heat up food to eat at night.You can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. Do check out Pizzeria Uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. For cheaper food, do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall.The hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from Mon to Thur. I did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent.I will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to Chicago."
144,200,"Jun 10 2008 	Great All Suite Hotel	We stayed at Homewood Suites for one week in May. It was a very nice all suite hotel with so many amenities. Weather was cool and rainy (2 half days only), but thats a given for the month of May. Ive attached pictures (not of hotel, as they are exactly as is on the website).We were very close to everything (red line CTA, shopping on Michigan Avenue, restaurants, convenience stores, bus stops, free shuttle to Navy Pier just a few steps away) etc. The best location we could have chosen.Room was relatively clean. Flat screen in living room was either damaged or had bad resolution, few other minor issues. Rooms were cleaned every day around 10-11am, everything was replenished. I agree with others on this forum that the rooms do look a lot larger on the website than in reality; which is small, but again, comfortable surroundings. Not much walking space in the bedroom and I banged into the wall in the middle of the night on my way to the washroom, so be careful lol. Our room was quite which we were grateful for. Every vacation weve been on, weve had noisy occupants, so this was a first.Breakfast buffet had a large variety of choices to suit everyone. We did not care for the liquid scrambled cheese eggs (too dry and rubbery) and bacon, but everything else was great. We had malt waffles every day! Biscuits are hot and tender. Fresh whole fruit or cut up fruit is a plus, as is skim milk and yogurt. I would personally suggest trying the great restaurants that Chicago has to offer rather than the free dinner buffet (Mon-Thursday), but if youre on a budget or have a large family to feed, etc. you might want to give it a try. There is free red/white wine and beer, and we saw many people come down for just that.Free internet access with color printer in the business center was a real plus for helping us research and print off maps for our itinerary. Printer wasnt working on the last two days we were there though. Gym and pool on 19th floor with a great night view. We never made use of it, but wish we had the time. Some highlights of our trip were the deep dish pizza which we could not get enough of, the Lincoln Zoo, shopping on Michigan Avenue and The Blue Man Group, which we saw at the last minute. I got pulled onstage by one of the Blue men and it was a thrill to be part of the show for about 15 minutes!! We love Chicago and will definitely return. We will definitely stay at Homewood Suites! Please message me if you require further info on anything at all. We had a fabulous time. Other than our AA flight which was cancelled and delayed by 12 hours, it was a nice vacation!"
145,200,"Jun 9 2008 	A pleasant surprise	My friends and I were celebrating a Bachelorette party downtown and all pitched in on a room at the Homewood Suites because of its great location and the price was reasonable as well. The suite was spacious. We had a nice sized kitchen (glasses, coffee mugs, silverware, plates, etc). Late at night, we called down to room service for extra blankets and pillows. They brought them to our room within 5 minutes...that really impressed me. Also, the king size bed was very comfortable.The overall pros:-plenty of space-comfortable bed with goose down pillows-huge flat screen tv in the &quot;living room&quot; area-well stocked kitchen area-very clean-room service was quickThe cons:-remote for the tv in the bedroom didn't work-electrical outlet next to vanity didn't work-pull-out couch was uncomfortable to sleep on-lcheck in is not on the first level of the hotel-parking is pricey!"
146,200,"Jun 1 2008 	Ideal for Chicago	This is an excellent option for downtown Chicago. Spacious suites, 2 TV's one a HD, huge double bed, decent kitchenette; All at a v reasonable price.Staff are v friendly and the location just off the Mag Mile is ideal. Red Line subway (Grand) outside the hotel is perfect for White Sox stadium....2 mins from a Jewel Osco supermarket and tons of bars and restaurants including the brilliant Pops for Champagne.Highly recommened."
147,200,"May 30 2008 	A Great Place to Stay!	We stayed at the Homewood Suites for 3 nights in November 2007. (My partner &amp; 10 month Son). This was a great place to stay with a family, the location was amazing and the service at the hotel was wonderful with some of the most friendly staff I have ever experienced. We were blown away with the breakfasts available and the fact that you can pack your own take-away box and take food back to your room! The hotel is directly opposite a chinese restaurant and an amazing pizza restaurant (great for the famous deep dish!) all which come in handy when dining out with young one's isn't your cup of tea!When visiting Chicago again I would definitely stay here!"
148,200,"May 25 2008 	A great experience	We just got home from our 4 day stay at the Homewood Suites. I have been to Chicago several times before, but this was my first time staying in the Homewood Suites. The homewood suites was nicer and more affordable than hotels I have stayed in previously.My family and I were really impressed with the Homewood Suites. We had a 1 bedroom King suite. As mentioned before there was a full sized fridge and freezer, with a really fast ice maker, a dishwasher, and dishes including pots and pans. I really liked that there was door to shut the bedroom off from the living room. The room was really clean, we were on the 18th floor which is a non-smoking floor, so there were not any musty, old smoky smells that you can sometimes get at hotels.The free breakfast was great, much better than any other free breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. Hot scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, corned beef hash, fresh fruit in addition to typical cold breakfast options like bagels, donuts, muffins, cereal and yogurt. I have to say being able to start our day with a hot breakfast each day was great.The staff was friendly, especially the doormen and valet parkers. We mentioned where we were going one day and they gave us directions to the closest place to get a CTA pass and then told us which bus we would need. Overall our experience was great and we are planning on staying here again."
149,200,"May 23 2008 	Good	It was just OK. Very clean. Polite staff. Quiet. Great Location. Rooms are smaller than they look on the hotel web-site Breakfast was a rip-off, take a short walk to the pancake house. Teeny tiny beds, something between a full and a twin, tight for 2 people to sleep in. We have 3 10 year-olds and needed a suite with room. The couch folds out - fine for kids. $10 per day for internet access... another rip-off. I would stay here again but look at other options first."
150,200,"May 17 2008 	At home at the Homewood Suites	My stay was 5 days and I was there for a convention. All the staff, from the bellmen to the front desk were friendly and helpful. The breakfast and managers dinner receptions had quite a variety and was always good. The hotel location was great-just one block off Michigan avenue with plenty of restaurants around to choose from, There were two groceries nearby-Jewel Osco and Trader Joes-that I bought wraps &amp; sandwiches to pack for lunch at the convention. (The food situation at McCormick Place Convention Center was awful-but that is another story!) There was plenty of shopping and I never felt unsafe walking alone. The room was nice but the carpet was frayed at the bathroom entrance and I did wonder if the carpets were ever vacuumed as I noticed a cookie crumb I had dropped stayed there almost the whole stay. But still basically a nice room with a nice view-especially at night. My price per night fluctuated from @189.00 to start, up to 312.00 by the end of my stay-of course I would have liked to have the cheaper price the whole stay. I would stay here again (if the price was right) and would recommend it."
151,200,"May 12 2008 	Friendly staff great location great value	My husband and I stayed for four nights at the Homewood Suites in Chicago and would highly recommend it. I'll try not to repeat other reviewers, but it must be said again that the location of the hotel is very desirable. It's one block off the red line for the subway and many sights are within walking distance of the hotel. As others have said the morning breakfast is a huge value and it's quite good. I liked that they put out to-go containers and were happy to allow people to take food back to their room. We could only take advantage of the evening snacks and drinks one night as they're only offered Monday - Thursday evenings. Our experience was the food was pretty bland, but it was great to have a few free glasses of wine. The pool on the top floor is great as you can look out the windows and see all the Downtown lights and buildings while you're in the pool. There's a small work out facility as well. The room itself was very comfortable and immaculate. I liked that you could easily get food delivered to your room from nearby restaurants or you could fix a meal yourself or store your leftovers in the fridge. There's a Trader Joes nearby where you can buy inexpensive wine and all kinds of groceries for a reasonable cost. The staff was exceptionally friendly and very accommodating. The only issue we had was with one of the doormen when we first arrived. When we arrived and grabbed a brochure on an architectural river tour the doorman told us, &quot;That one is sold out for tonight.&quot; He then tried to book us with a different company (I'm sure he gets a kickback or something). We ended up walking to the river and the tour with the original company was not sold out and he'd been lying to us. That was annoying, but I don't know if the doormen even work for the hotel. One suggestion I'd make if you stay here is to consider earplugs. We didn't hear noise from within the hotel, but from the street below. We were on the second to top floor and the sound of horns and cars did make it a little hard for me to fall asleep. That's probably not a hotel issue, just a city issue. My husband wasn't bothered by it, so maybe it's only an issue if you're sensitive to noise.A few tourist recommendations: check out Bobby's Bike Hike. We did the Chicago Neighborhood tour and it was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. You get to see things that are off the beaten path and the guide was a lot of fun and very informative. Definitely check out the fountains with the faces on them in Millenium Park. Lots of fun. Also, we went in both the Sears Tower and the Hancock Observatory and would recommend the Hancock. The views were of the water and the city and just prettier. The Sears Tower felt very sterile to me. It was hard to get a feel of how high up you are since it's completely closed off by windows that don't open. Having been in the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower there's something to be said for feeling the wind blowing on you and hearing the sounds below you. The Sears Tower doesn't give you that feeling. You can go up in the Hancock for free if you go to the Lounge and buy a drink. Two lousy mixed drinks were about $25 total so next time I'd just order a soda ($5.00) or pay to go to the actual observation deck. Don't miss the Field Museum. It's amazing. The Shedd Aquarium is also fun. If you've been to Sea World you won't be impressed by their live shows. Plus they seated everyone 1/2 hour before the show where you got to sit on a hard stone bench with someone's knees in your back and your knees in the back of the person in front of you. However, the exhibits were really well done. We saw a few things we've never seen before. Check out the City Pass as it saves you money if you'll be seeing a few of the major tourist attractions. Navy Pier was pretty disappointing to us. Several greasy chain restaurants and lots of ticky tacky tourist stuff. Maybe in the summer it's more fun with street performers and the like, but in late April it was a disappointment. Kids would enjoy it because of the ferris wheel, but don't go out of your way to see it. There's so many better things to see and do.Overall, great hotel, great city, just wished we could have stayed longer."
152,200,"May 10 2008 	The right choose	Amazing location, Very close from the Hampton inn and the Hilton Garden Inn (downtown), so dont lose time, like i did, comparing locations, they are all great. You can have a 1 minute walk to the delicious, pricey, Joe's Stone Crab or a Sushi place with outstanding food quality and a forgettable name; if you walk to the other side you'll find P.F. Chang's. If you can walk more than a minute you will have numerous options.If working out is a must for you, as a homewood guest you can acces the &quot;crunch&quot; gym right next door. It's a really big place with lots of fine equipment, a paradise for the ones who need a gym. If you like running, it takes only a 2 minute jog to the track beside the lake where you can rent bikes or skates or just run. We walked to the stores, restaurants, theater (Jersey boys! a must!), Opera, Navy Pier, etc. If needed a taxi would cost 5-7 dollars.The room is nice, according to the price, with some details on the wallpaper and a small leak when rained (in a corner far away from the bed and sitting area, so we didnt mind) the room is not big but roomy and the view was perfetc!.Breakfast included is very good: fruit, kryspy kremes, eggs, cereals, breads, yoghur, etc.The staff at front desk are extremely corteous and helpful, they always gave us the best directions, tips and assistance. I will never go back to the other expensive hotels, this my hotel at Chicago from now on."
153,200,"May 4 2008 	Our home in Chicago	We had a conference at the nearby Marriott and thankfully could not get a room there, since it would have been $3-400 a night there. We found Homewood Suites, which is literaly next door. From our room, we could look into the rooms at the Marriott.Boy are we glad we found this place. We paid $189 a night for 7 nights. If you stay 7 nights, it is considered &quot;extended stay&quot; and it is cheaper-probably cheaper total than if you stay 4-5 nights. Their pricing is a tad bit confusing because most room types have different rates on different nights, so just make sure you know what you average room rate is before thinking you got a great deal for all nights.Location: It is one block off Mag Mile, and across street from Nordstrom, PF Changs, Pizzeria Uno, Bloomingdales, ESPNzone etc. GREAT location within walking distance of anything on Michigan Ave. or the Loop. In the room they have menus from various eateries that will deliver. Rannallis is great for pretty basic italian fare and salads. They are fast and only charge $2.50 delivery. Public areas: The staff is very friendly. You take elevator to floor 6 for lobby, shop, and dining room.....Almost the best part is the breakfast, which is probably the best complimentary brekfasts I have had a hotel ever. Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, panckaes, french toast or fresh waffles, cereal, donuts, bread bagels fruit, yogurt, juice hot drinks. It got a little monotonous after 7 days, but the higher end-hotels don't even have this nice a breakfast for $$. NOR do the ritzey places have a buffett dinner. It is Mon-Thursday and is basic, but they have themes. Spagetti and meatballs, hamburger, pizza, Philly Cheese steak, chinese, etc. Usually some steamed veggies, small salad bar, hot entree and usually some kind of vegetarian option like mac/cheese, potatoes. Beer and Wine and soft drinks. Cake and pudding for dessert. Very passable, especially if you think that yo are saving $40 on dinner or more. We ate there 2 night out of 7. You can take the food to-go up to your room as well.Room: we had a corner room. All the &quot;_04&quot; rooms are on the southeast corner which affords a view from the Hancock Tower to the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building in the middle. We loved it. You walk in and it has an almost full kitchen (no oven) with fridge, 2-burner cooktop, microwave, sink, dishwasher and dishes for about 4 people. Then there is a living area with dining table/desk, two dining chairs, an easy chair, couch, coffee table and tv. The bedroom has a confy king bed with pelty of pillows and clean duvet cover, tv and standard bathroom. You can close the bedroom door and the couch folds out. You have to go thru the bedroom to get to the bathroom. The dcor is urban, with warm colors and some ncie bw photos of Chicago architecture.There is free wireless and ethernet cable internet in the room, which worked great. They also have a business center on floor 6 with printers, and conference table etc, so you can print out boarding pass etc. All the expensive hotel charge $10 a dayand that is if you can get it to work properly. Overall, we were REALLY pleased with the quality AND value. These days you are lucky to get one of thsoe in a hotel, but to get both-wow, that says a lot. It makes you wonder how Hilton is able to do it, and makes you wonder how much profit these swankier palces make on just a simple room and no extras at all and still charge twice as much.We will be back to this place and will look for more of these Homewood Suites elsewhere."
154,200,"Apr 7 2008	Good location and very nice	This hotel is very good in general.Good for families like us as rooms are spacious.Good value as breakfast and light dinner (Mon-Thurs) included.Location is great for the Magnificent mile.Main advise is not to trust the staff to help you with any transport. Staff at check-in (6th floor) are unware of information on getting around so refer you to the staff on the ground floor. I needed to get to another town, the staff booked me a terrible taxi with a man with a broken arm at an exhorbitant rate (I think he was related or something). The guy didn't know the route and didn't hang around for the return as previously agreed as he reckons he got an emergency call from the hospital who wanted to see him .... I didn't think hospitals were that responsive!!! I was told by the guy who sorted this out that limos would charge $300 each way. In the end I had to get a limo for the return which cost me $80 ... way cheaper than what the taxi driver charged me.This hotel is a great hotel but diminished by dodgy staff practices."
155,200,"Apr 4 2008	homewood suites great for the family	Upon the the recommendations of TripAdvisor reviews we chose Homewood Suites on Grand Ave. one block from the Michigan Avenue for a two night stay the week after Easter. It cost $179 per night plus parking. We checked in an hour early and were given upon request a corner room on the top floor. The indoor pool was on the same floor. My wife and two daughters, ages 8 &amp; 10 enjoyed the pool and the convenience of walking down the hall to go swimming. There is a free breakfast buffet and at 5:00 p.m., wine, beer and a light dinner during the week. The location was great and we had a 15 minute walk to the American Girl Store. The concierge/bellman, Rod, was very helpful and got as a discount for the river cruise which was also a short walk from the hotel. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. Check out the Homewood Suites web cite for room details and prices.."

157,200,"Apr 1 2008 	Had a nice getaway	The Mrs and I decided to get out of Texas for a few days. We picked the Homewood because of location (Near just about everything). Staff very nice, very helpful. Clean room (Some spots no big deal). Neighbors upstairs got loud, but the hotel took care of that quickly. Looking forward to staying at The Homewood again (Just next time in the summer)."
158,200,"Mar 31 2008 	A surprising finding	We were attracted by the rates offerd by the website of this hotel and our stay exceeeded all expectations. All rooms have a spacious sitting area with a small but very useful kitchen and an adequate sized bedroom. The latter would do with some more space, but this does not matter as most of the time is spent in the sitting room. The hotel also offers free wifi throughout.We found the hotel very convenient located for all shopping and main attractions of Chicago. The breakfast offered are adequate and there is a free evening buffet every night except weekends. The latter is not particularly exciting, but it is a nice touch and particularly convenient if you have kids. The hotel is close by to some very good restaurants and it even have a direct line to some of them to order carry out! There is a small swimming pool and excercise room at the top floor and both offer great views of the city.On the negative side was teh smell in our room, which although was in a non smoking floor it clearly smelt of smoke. The reception and general service are not particularly effective or attentive but this does not matter that much as you have very minimum contact with them - the reception is at the 8th floor of the building. We found the value of this place unbeatable especially for what it has to offer and we would happily recommend it."
159,200,"Mar 25 2008 	Very Nice!	We stayed here March 21st and had a great experience. The rooms are very nice and clean and had a great view from the 18th floor. There is a heated pool and a cardio room on the 19th floor and it is all windows so you get an even better view from there. The breakfast buffet was great(according to my fiance...I wasn't hungry).The front desk staff is extremely friendly and the valet was great as well. The hotel is located within walking distance of most of the major shopping and only 7 blocks from Navy Pier. The only complaint that I had was that the wireless internet would only work in one spot at the corner of the bed in our room. Overall, it was a great stay and I will definitely recommend it to anyone that asks."
160,200,"Mar 24 2008 	The BEST Hotel	Have no hesitation booking this hotel. To start, the rooms are ample in size, a bedroom,bathroom, living area and kitchenette. Theres a Tv in both the bedroom and living area. The rooms are nicely decorated and spotless clean. The staff at this hotel are extremely friendly and helpful from the reception to the doorman. The breakfast buffet and the evening meal which is included in the price of your stay is great too. Also there is complimentary tea cofee and hot choclate available all day from the reception area. I could go on and on about how good this hotel is...but I won't. All I'll say is if your going to Chicago BOOK IT. The location is great just beside Mischegan Avenue. The staff are the friendliest and most helpful I've come across and the hotel itself is lovely. When I booked this hotel it was number 14 on tripadvisors top Chicago hotels. Its 7 now and I won't be suprised if it creeps up to number 1. I've dowmloaded pictures I took during my stay. Oh and heres a tip if your going to Chicago, go to see the Jerry Sringer show just up the road from the hotel its hilairious. You'll get free tickets by emailing the show(addreess is on their website)."
161,200,"Mar 19 2008 	Wonderful Location Good Hotel!	The Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago is a fabulous place to stay -- a real deal given the rates the the superb location.The hotel is not fancy, but is perfectly adequate. Suites are quiet, nicely furnished and well equipped. Nice touches such as lots of soft, thirsty towels, flat screen TV, free internet elevate this hotel above much of the competition. Of course, each 'unit' is a suite! There is a full buffet breakfast served every morning -- nothing grand, but adequate (beware that it closes at 9:30 on weekdays); small pool and fitness area as well as access to a great Crunch gym next door. Staff were uniformly pleasant and accommodating -- a real bonus!!!Best of all is the location -- the Mag Mile is one block away, river north is full of wonderful restaurants for all budgets, you are within walking distance of the Loop attractions as well as subway station a few feet away! Good off-site parking is available next to the Hilton Garden Inn as well if you want to save a few dollars.For the price, with breakfast, room to spread out and fab location -- the Homewood Suites are wonderful! Enjoy!"
162,200,"Mar 16 2008 	wonderful hotel-great location.	We are checking out of Homewood Suites today. Great hotel! It is located where you can walk to everything. There are great restaurants all around the hotel. The breakfast buffet is awesomeand a full hot breakfast, There is a full kitchen and 2 separate rooms in the suite. The pool is indoor and heated on the 19th floor. The beds have great linens and there are plenty of thick towels provided. It is quiet and our room on the 17th floor has an incredible view. You can ask for a room with a view or high floor when you make your reservations. Very clean and spacious room. We will definitely stay here again!!! BTW-check out time of 12 noon is great for catching afternoon flights."
163,200,"Feb 29 2008 	The staff make this a really good place to stay.	This could easily have been another anonymous box to stay in, but the staff make it really special. The hotel is in downtown Chicago, 5 minutes walk from the Michigan Avenue 'Magnificent Mile'. All rooms are suites, with a cooker, hob, pans and crockery. Breakfast is free, and there is a free evening meal on weekdays if you are on a budget (we didn't try it, but it looked OK - there seemed to be draft beer and carafes of wine). There is a gym and a pool. It's very child-friendly and would make a great hotel for families. We paid $140 plus tax's per night for an 8 day stay - this is very good for central Chicago. But its the staff who really make this hotel - very friendly and helpful - quite special."
164,200,"Feb 19 2008 	First Chicago Trip	Homewood Suites Downtown is a good choice for the family traveler. The view of downtown buildings is great at night. The central location allows for walking to many stores and restaurants. At no time did we feel unsafe, although we were approached by many homeless folks, which can be said of many large cities. The rental car had GPS info, which was great for directions to the hotel, but was confused by all of the buildings when we went to leave (still found I-90 ok, had printed instructions just in case). Room service is available from PF Chang's, but there is a 20% surcharge imposed by the hotel and a delivery fee, neither of which are given to the delivery person. Breakfast each morning was excellent, with to go containers readily available to take back to the room. Staff was friendly. Pool was small, but exercise room was well equipped."
165,200,"Feb 18 2008 	Great budget hotel.....with a few extras!	My wife and I just returned from a wonderful weekend in Chicago and the Homewood Suites was much more than I expected. Since we were on a budget we wanted to get as close to Michigan Avenue as we could without giving up too many frills. This hotel was a great value. They offer a full breakfast buffet every morning which will save you a few bucks especially if you have the kids with you. I will warn you that the buffet is quite crowded on the weekends so you may want to grab a takeout box and eat in your room. My wife and I traveled alone, but we were in the minority. Lots of kids running around so don't book this one for a Honeymoon or anything like that. The hotel is located directly across the street from Nordstroms which is the quickest (and warmest) way to access Michigan Avenue. Grand Avenue actually goes UNDER Michigan Avenue so if you are not aware of your surroundings you will walk right past it (Remember, go through Nordstroms). The room was clean and spacious and if you are staying for a long time they will even do some grocery shopping for you. Again, great for the budget conscious. The doormen are hilarious and will help you find anything you need. All in all, I would recommend this to anyone that is bringing the family to Chicago and wants to save a few bucks along the way. Enjoy!"
166,200,"Feb 12 2008 	Great Service in Chicago!	This was our second stay at the Homewood Suites in Chicago. Since last year they have updated the rooms with a flat screen TV, new flooring, and some updated appliances in the kitchen. What stood out the most was the consistent excellent customer service diplayed by the entire staff. From the doormen and parking valet, to the front desk and even the maids, everyone went out of their way to make you feel at home.The free hot breakfast buffet is a nice touch and the rooms are nice in size with a sitting area and full kitchen. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located less than 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile. We booked directly throught the hotel website for only $135. It is an extra $35 to park your car for 24 hours, but you get in and out privileges at no charge. Based on the horific lack of street parking in Chicago, the $35 is actually not too bad of a deal. We had a great stay and it's wel worth the money for it's location."
167,200,"Feb 9 2008 	Good amenities spacious but Underwhelmed	I had a business trip to Chicago for 3 nights so I chose it for all the benefits it offers- free breakfast, free wireless, suite rooms. I paid $149/nite and while it was a good deal for the price I was not impressed with the rooms themselves. When I checked in around 10pm - the first room I got on the 8th floor which was supposed to be non-smoking was reeking of smoke. I didn't want to make a fuss but finally couldn't take it so called the front desk to either give me another room or have someone come with air freshener. The housekeeping came quickly with airfreshener and he agreed that the room smelled like someone smoked in it so they gave me a new room. The suites are a good size but a bit dark for my taste. Bathroom was stark and ceiling had water stains all over. Rug didn't look all that great /clean so felt like I had to have shoes on the whole time. I prefer hotels where I can kick off my shoes and just hang.. I'd stayed in a Homewood Suite before near Boston and thought it was fine but the Chicago one was a bit unimpressive. Overall I think if you were there with family - as it was for many guests it seems, it would be sufficient. Seemed like a great location, right next to PF Chang restaurant, Nordstrom, ESPN zone(?), overall pretty convenient. Again, the amenities are great - free full breakfast, free coffee/tea all day, free wireless access, etc. are all great. Bed is good, sofa is okay. Hardly used the kitchen but was pretty unhappy in the morning when I woke up to see they didn't restock my coffee... I have to say that I was underwhelmed - and didn't feel as comfy at Homewood as I did in Boston's Homewood. Personally, I wouldn't stay there again for personal or business reasons - not for me. I had plenty of hotel choices in Chicago for this biz trip and I kept kicking myself why I didn't choose the Embassy Suites nearby for $159/nite or stay closer to my office at the W - albeit for $209/nite... (albeit would have to pay for online access).. I've stayed in other Embassy Suites before and feel that their decor is usually more brighter/lighter and cleaner looking."
168,200,"Feb 6 2008 	We had a great stay at Homewood!	My husband and I went to Chicago with our two young daughters for a quick overnight getaway. We live in Michigan and the train ride was about 3 hrs. Check-in was not until 4pm and we showed up around 3:45 hoping to get right in. The front desk attendant let us know it would be about a 15 minute wait which was reasonable considering actual check-in wasn't until 4pm anyway. She was very nice and during our wait she even updated us several times. The issue however was that it took more like 25 minutes, which was inconvenient given our daughters are 8 and 6 and had been waiting for this trip forever!Anyway, besides that one thing, everything else was great. When we got to our room it was immaculate. There was a fridge, microwave, coffee pot, hair dryer, etc. The couch pulled out to a sleeper bed. There were two double beds in the bedroom area. Everything was tastefully decorated. The bathroom was normal, but still very nice with plenty of towels and when we called for toothpaste it was brought right up. We went to the top floor pool and it was great. No one else was there and we had the pool all to ourselves. I wish they had a hot tub but no biggie. The breakfast buffet was amazing. They had pretty much anything you wanted from eggs, hash, and french toast to fresh fruit, donuts and bagels. The drinks were juices, milks (chocolate or white and even skim), coffee, hot tea, hot chocolate or pop. And it was all free and all delicious. The kids thought this was paradise. Check-out was a breeze. I forgot to mention there were plenty of pillows on the beds and a super soft blanket. We slept great. Everything was quiet, there was plenty of hot water. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about the place. It was great for the four of us and for $140 two blocks from Michigan Ave, I would definitely stay there again."
169,200,"Feb 3 2008 	Definitely coming back!	This was my first time in the city, but my husband has traveled here before. I was expecting the normal city attitude....rush, rush, with not the cleanist atmosphere but acceptable for a big city.....however I was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel was amazing, for the rate we paid we werent expecting to be so satisfied. The staff was super welcoming and friendly, from the personalized welcome message left on our room machine after check in, to the fresh hot breakfast and super friendly staff. Always greeting you and willing to help with anything. Whether its just holding the door and wishing you a good evening as you venture out for dinner or giving you a run down of the &quot;must see&quot; locations during your visit. And if you need a cab, don't worry...The door men go out of thier way to hail a cab and provide some entertainment as you wait! I would have thought we paid much more. This hotel does not take any short cuts. Rooms were spatious, clean, and provided a warm atmosphere with an outstanding view! I will deffinetly book a room at this hotel for my next visit to the windy city!"

The hotel is in great location...right next to Michigan Ave and less than two blocks from a Red line stop which made it easy for me to get around Chicago. Upon arrival, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the amenities that they offered. I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Chicago."

172,200,"Jan 10 2008 	Best Hotel I've stayed in by far	I am just back from staying in the Homewood Suites Chicago. Myself and 3 others stayed there for a week over the New Year. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. From its location to it facilities we could not have asked for more. It is located only a 3/4 min walk form Mag Mile (where all the shops are), there is a Nordstrom right across the road, plus there are loads of bars and restaurants all within 5 min walking distance of the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was ideal to set you up for the day with all tastes being catered for, all the &quot;light meal&quot; they provide on mon-thurs (also complimentary) is just enough when you want to unwind after a long days shopping/sightseeing. The hotel also has free internet access which was a real help when we wanted to look something in particaular up.The rooms were fantastic, the most comfortable beds i've slept in in ages, the seperated living room and bedroom were ideal when there was a dispute over the telly or one person wanted to sleep.The staff at the hotel were brilliant, especially the lads at the conceigerge, they couldn't have been more helpful, no matter how trivial your question.All in all we had a fantastic time in chicago, and we will definitely being staying in Homewood suites the next time we go. I have friends already planning on staying there when they visit during the year."

This is an all-suite hotel, and each suite has a full kitchen (including garbage disposal, range top, and dishwasher!). The bedroom is a separate room, so it was great to be able to put the kids down for the night and enjoy watching movies with my husband until we were ready to go to bed. A suite with two double beds (which is what we had) sleeps six very comfortably...especially since both rooms have a TV, which meant that I wasn't stuck watching Cartoon Network 24/7. :-)The breakfast was just wonderful! It had all the usual complimentary continental breakfast fare, plus fresh fruit, granola, and yogurt to make your own parfaits...plus a great variety of hot items! This is a great, hot breakfast, which we particularly enjoyed since the weather was so horrifyingly cold while we were in Chicago.We didn't avail ourselves of the complimentary evening meal, so I can't speak with any authority on it...but based on everything else we saw, I'm sure it was very good also.Since we had kids with us, though, I CAN speak with absolute authority on the pool, which is located on the top floor of the hotel and which has the most beautiful view of the city in three directions! It was particularly stunning after dark! Even if you don't plan to swim, it's worth the elevator ride to check out the view.Finally, the location was absolutely ideal! The Homewood Suites is less than two blocks from Michigan Avenue (and its easy bus access) and less than two blocks from a red line subway station. And there is a Jewel/Osco just two blocks away...perfect for picking up CTA passes, snacks, and groceries.The Homewood Suites isn't a fancy-schmancy hotel like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula, but there is a good reason why TripAdvisor members have ranked it the best hotel in Chicago for families: it is the PERFECT hotel in the downtown area for families with kids!"
174,200,"Dec 31 2007 	Excellent deal. Perfect choice for visiting Chicago.	My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown and I can tell you that we were absolutely satisfied with the Hotel:- The room was huge, with a complete kitchen, a living room with a great flat TV and a separate dormitory with another big flat TV. We also had good views from the street.- The dinner service was a great deal. Breakfast and dinner were included in the price of the room. And both were all you can eat buffets with a good food quality!! You can even take food to your room with a Tupperware (that you find in the buffet)!!!.- The staff was really nice and always ready to help you.- The location is perfect, in the city center within a four minutes walking to the magnificent mile, and next to the famous Uno's legendary Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza!What else can we ask for? Homewood Suites Chicago is a perfect choice!"
