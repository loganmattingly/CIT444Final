50,1622,"Feb 23 2008 	Nice hotel but good distance south of centre	We stayed here on the first night of kuoni taj tour. Arrived early morning (7am) and they managed to get us in a room for half eight, which we weren't expecting. First room hadn't been serviced, but a quick call to reception got us another room. After a few hours sleep we went a wander to the local shops to go to an ATM. Its obviously an expected part of india to encounter fairly stark poverty, but it was still an eye opener. But we felt perfectly safe.There are a couple of ATMs within 5 Mins of hotel, quite handy as you can't get rupees before you go and the exchange desk at airport didn't take debit cards, only credit. Hotel will obviously change currency for you. Staff were very friendly and hotel was very modern and clean. we were obviously a bit wary of the dreaded &quot;delhi belly&quot; so we played safe and ate in the hotels indian restaurant &quot;se7en&quot;, which was excellent, lovely indian food and fairly reasonable from a western perspective. We also had a couple of drinks in the atrium bar which was lovely, if fairly quiet. A few of our fellow travellers ate at a local chinese called &quot;lotus&quot; ( i think) without any ill effects. As mentioned, you are a fair distance from india gate and connaught square, certainly not walkable, not a problem for us as we were on a escorted tour but worth bearing in mind. Overall, a good choice for delhi, would stay here again."
51,1622,"Feb 8 2008	haven of rest in crazy city	We stayed here twice during a recent tour of India. Both times it was a welcome place to stay in a hectic city.Spacious lobby, spacious room,extremely clean and well kept.Staff was helpful, breakfast was good.I wish all the other places we stayed had been as nice and comfortable!"
52,1622,Jan 6 2008	Very Helpful	Stayed at Crowne Plaza with group of 5 girls for whom this was part of India 'experience'. Asked for and got all the help I needed in providing girls a once in a lifetime experience. They arranged day trip to Taj Mahal with meals and guides. Could not have been better. Gave us free late check out. Girls loved the gift shop in the ground floor level. Finally surprised me with complementary transport to airport on our departure. Cannnot fault the attitude of the staff in all areas. Would unreservedly recommend this hotel to any group like ours.
53,1622,"Nov 28 2007 	Good Hotel for Delhi	I have stayed in this hotel 3 times over the past 4 years, travelling on business; the last time was December 2006. I stay because of it's proximity to my businessThe rooms are clean and spacious and really what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel. I laughed when I read a recent review about the lobby smelling of Damp - it does!The smelly lobby aside the hotel restaurants on the upper and ground floors are excellent and for a simple buffet the Cafe is fineIt's a good base for travellers to Dehli, however be warned December - January is wedding season in Delhi (and probably India) and it's very busy with private functions"
54,1622,"Oct 29 2007 	The Crowne Plaza Surya Sucks	On entering the grand marble lobby I was immediately struck by a very damp and unpleasant smell. This remained the case for the entire week I stayed at this hotel. I found the service in the hotel to be below average and at times was totally ignored by staff at the hotel's reception. The breakfast was very average indeed. The hotel lacks atmosphere and beware the rooms on the 1st floor, often the very rooms offered by some travel websites. These rooms are damp and the one I was offered had the carpet lifting from the damp. I asked to be moved to a room higher up in the hotel, at an additional $75 per night this was done. Definitely not worth the extra in fact a total rip off. I have been to Delhi a number of times and this was by far the worst hotel. No atmosphere and definitely not recommended."
55,1622,"Oct 21 2007 	Excellent hotel no complaints	I spent 1 night at the Crowne Plaza Delhi and found the hotel in excellent condition. The double bedroom was large enough to move without problems, big bed with excellent mattress, clean sheets, room equipped with desk+chair, sideboard, armchair with table, flat-screen tv. Bathroom was, like the bedroom, spotlessly clean, no mold anywhere, great Ayurveda toiletries. Breakfast buffet offered breakfast for Asian and Western tastes (currries etc. but also bread, butter, marmelade...) Really no complaints (which you might expect from a 5-star hotel). When in Delhi I would come back to the Crowne Plaza any time."
56,1622,"Sep 18 2007 	Overall a bit pricey and not the best experience.	Was clean, with an impressive lobby but the room was smallish, had old decor, and had a shakey door that needed to be repaired. There were renovations going on so the pool was out, which i was not informed about, although the gym was well equipped and modern. Management were rude to my friend when she checked in, and the post cards that i gave to the bell desk (with money) never arrived in Australia. Would not return to this hotel."
57,1622,"Jun 27 2007 	Under renovation but still enjoyed stay	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 6 weeks while on a business trip. Hotel was clean and staff friendly. Overall an excellent hotel and will be even better once renovation works are all completed, unfortunately this did mean loud noise/banging sometimes but staff always helpful and apologetic and did move me to a quieter room when possible. Nice pool area and choice of restaurants but the 24hr cafe did get a little boring as it was the only place open after work due to working to fit in with UK time."
58,1622,"May 4 2007 	An Excellent Stay at the Surya	We were in Delhi twice in December, and the first time we stayed at the Taj Palace, you can see my review on its hotel page, and the second time we stayed at the Surya, the reason being, one of our local friends recommended it. While the hotel itself isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace, the service is still pretty good. We had a regular room booked, but since we had a lot of luggage we mentioned that we needed a bit more space so we were upgraded to a suite for free, which was great! The suite had more than enough room, and some great features, for example, we were able to turn the shower on from the phone next to the bed, so it was nice and hot when we got in there. The location of this hotel is also excellent (much better than the Taj Palace) it is within walking distance of some great resturants, both Indian and Non-Indian, Ego Thai which is nearby was great and some of the best thai food I have had from around the world. The hotel also has a club, which wasn't that happening, but played some good music. Overall, this hotel isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace in Delhi in terms of service, food, and comfort, but its still pretty excellent, I found them slightly more accomdating, and our suite was bigger than the one we had at the Taj Palace. More importantly, the location is fabulous, you can't go wrong with either hotel."
59,1622,"May 2 2007 	Very mediocre but expensive hotel	Everything at the Crowne Plaza is mediocre. From the food to the rather tacky room decor to the service. The rates are rather expensive and you could stay at a much better property for the same price. I was upgraded to the Premiere Club floor but was unable to partake of the amenities and perks. I was told that I was not able to use the Club as I was upgraded. I checked and it is indeed the policy of the hotel that upgrades to the Club Floors are not welcome or able to use the Club floor facilities. I complained and explained that it is like being upgraded to a First Class seat on a flight, but not being able to have the food, service or amenities of it; being welcome to use the seat only. They gave in and told me that I could use the Club floor facilities but I felt very unwelcome and like a charity case. I booked a very expensive auyervedic massage in the spa. The spa is nothing fancy but does have a large &amp; interesting menu of auyervedic massages. My 1 hour massage was a nightmare due to the construction going on 1 floor above. I listened to pounding and jackhammers the entire time. I obviously was unable to relax and enjoy the massage and ended up more tense than before the massage. I complained and was given an apology about the construction. They did not offer to give me another massage gratis or even give me a discount. You can get much better service, decor, food and quality for the same price at many other Delhi hotels."
60,1622,"Apr 13 2007 	Good hotel	Stayed there for a week, everything is nice and clean. The hotel has a nice outdoors pool and a big plus, if to avoid shopping in the center, it hosts a lot of shops selling stuff at the same prize like outside, it only needs some negotiations (like everywhere in India). The hotel has its own travelling counter, which is way too expensive, but the reception can be very helpful to book anything from outside. Don't be surprised, some of the receptionists speak/understand hardly any English, others do. The hotel is not closed to the center, but you can hire a 3 wheeled car, a tuc tuc, for 100 rupeehs per hour (don't pay more!). Transfer by local taxi to the International airport is 350 rupeehs and takes about 45min. I really recommend the location.Ana, Switzerland"
61,1622,Apr 5 2007 	Super stay	I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. The hotel was in my opinion excellent. The restaurants were good and breakfast was excellent. The hotel entrance was wonderful and the rooms as one would expect from a four star hotel. Enjoy your stay
62,1622,"Apr 2 2007	Clean 	Some of the rooms are a bit dated decor-wise but I believe the hotel is in the process of under going a make over. At present I would rate it as a 4* property. The bed was really comfortable &amp; we had no problems getting a good nights sleep. The lobby/reception area is most welcoming &amp; the restaurants serve a wide variety of food. The hotel is located on the outskirts of the centre of Delhi, but as it is such a vast metropolis I would not make location an issue."
63,1622,"Feb 28 2007 	Rubbish	Grubby hotel, may look like a 5 star from the photos- but when you get there, the place is grubby and in need of renovation.We booked for 7 nights but could only handle 3- we managed to get in to the Hyatt hotel - new and clean - much better and near the middle of Delhi - the Crown Plaza is miles away for anythingBook the Hyatt or the Grand, I wish we did from the start.Good Luck"
64,1622,"Feb 6 2007	OK...but...	Booked online with hotel website for 2 rooms under 1 name. When we arrived, they said they had 1 room for 2 people, and were sold out. After a few minutes of haggling, they had made a mistake in their hotel reservation system, and accomodated us. The hotel was OK, but quite far from the airport if you're just staying overnite as we were."
65,1622,"Jan 15 2007	A great and comfortable place to stay.	The Crowne Plaza was in the heart of New Delhi, with all the hustle and bustle going on around you. However, once you were inside, it was like being in a different world.The reception was huge and dazzling.There were plenty of lifts available.The dining was exceptional with 3 or maybe 4 places to eat withing the hotel itself. The breakfast was buffet style and very good. They catered easily for my Gluten Free diet.The staff were courteous and friendly."
66,1622,Oct 15 2006 	Awesome Staff! Nice very clean hotel.	The staff at this hotel is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. I was forced into the higher price and didnt know until check out. My husband was furious. We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted. One of the managers came to the hospital to personally speak with us and clear up the issue. I was so impressed we went back after I left the hospital. So glad! Our room was lovely. We used the travel desk and booked the nicest driver and guide for 3 days. He even took us to his home for tea! We loved this hotel. The only draw back was the main restaurant. Service was slow and food not to our liking. The Japanese restaurant was awesome! Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in New Delhi.
67,1622,"Sep 28 2006 	Get the feel of Crowne Plaza Delhi	Hi,This time I traveled with a group of friends and found this hotel in Delhi as an upmarket property to stay with. We all were booked for two nights and our stay at this hotel was an experience worth sharing about. Our Check in was done with soft drinks and warm welcome by the Reception lady, room was on the renovated floor with paintings in the corridor reflecting Indian art(impressive).Room was upto the international standards with cozy Bed and latest furnishing. Our Breakfast at Coffee shop was served by smiling and professional staff. Yes one must try the Health club which they have recently introduced with good equipments for health concious travellers.It was truly a 5 star experience in all the respect. There should be more hotels like this in every city of India.ThanksJames"
68,1622,"Sep 8 2006 	Excellent Product supported by Good personnel	Hi, my name is Wilson Garry stayed between 3rd Sep 06 and 07th Sep 06. well this was my first ever vist to India I was highly worried about my trip to New Delhi. As soon I reached the hotel I was impressed by the warm and grand Lobby of the hotel,check in was prompt and welcoming, was given a room on the 2nd floor which was fresh and contemporary. Room had features like LCD screen TV, Cubicle bath ,bedside console etc.Staff was highly helpful and warm in their approach. Had my Breakfast at Le Cafe which was lavish in choice and taste.On my last night I had my Dinner at Sampan the chinese restaurant and my experience with food was ok but staff was extremly professional and knowledgeble (specially the Captain).Only thing with little sluggishness was their Travel Desk which I used for my way back to Airport and it took some 10 minutes to get the Car at the porch.Overall a good experience to be with Crowne Plaza Delhi.Thanks"
69,1622,"Aug 4 2006 	Bailed out after one night - Avoid!	I booked a reservation at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi through the Holiday Inn Priority Club. I stayed at a Holiday Inn in Australia, and joined, thinking that I would accumulate points. What a mistake. The Crowne Plaza in New Delhi was probably a great hotel ten years ago, but it is showing its age. Apparently, parts of it are under renovation, and supposedly, some floors are completed. I did not see those floors. The lobby needs help. My room needed help. The room had excellent Wi Fi, and a large plasma TV, but the electrical outlets were iffy, the fixtures were cracked and fading, and the marble surfaces were showing a lot of wear. For $142 a night, I expected better. Particularly from an ostensibly five star hotel. This was just the beginning. I need to have a working electrical outlet next to the bed for some medical equipment that I use when I sleep, so it is a non-starter when the outlets do not work. The front desk sent up power adapters which blew the fuse in the outlet, (along with a young man who tried to blame my equipment, then asked me why did I not call housekeeping), then they sent up a very nice handyman who fiddled around in the ceiling with a horrifyingly antique-looking fuse box, and after some trial and error he was able to get the outlet working, but the lights in the room no longer responded to the light switches, and so they would not go out. No problem. I unscrewed all the lightbulbs so I could get some rest. Then I jumped onto the internet and booked a room at the Metropolitan Hotel Nikko. The first floor lounge restaurant offered somewhat surly help (waiter was fine, the night manager was tired, perhaps), and a very weird version of spaghetti a la carbonara. The banana shake was good, though. Oh, yeah. One other thing. The hotel neglected to send a car to meet me at the airport. I requested this when I made my reservation. I had to hire a car at DEL, which was....an adventure. I only wish that the Mandarin Hotel Group had a property in New Delhi. Trying the Hotel Nikko tomorrow. I am punching out of the Crowne Plaza, never to return. Strongly advise giving this joint a pass."
70,1622,"Jun 17 2006	one night review	What a pleasant surprise! After reading many of the reviews on tis site I was a little anxious about staying at this hotel but I stayed here for on night with my partner using Priority Club reward points for one night (22nd May 2006). We arrived early on the morning after an overnight flight and were very pleased to be given a room at 7.30am and given an upgrade to an executive floor room on the top floor.The room was newly refurbushed with flat screen TV and well equipped. The design felt a litle unusual/old fashioned but the room was newly refurbished and clean.The executive lounge facilities were basic but ofered free internet access, a very limited breakfast and limited evening canapes and evening drinks. there is however an excelent indian restaurant in the hotel and for those seeking more western options a Mcdonalds and Dominoes Pizza round the corner.The location is not central and away from Connaught Place but we were touring and had a car and driver so this did not seem to matter.The pool was nice and my partner took advantage of of a pedicure in the hotel which was excellent value for money. The hotel was very quiet during our stay but the service was excellent and I would recommend."
71,1622,"Mar 7 2006	A very enjoyable stay	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 2 nights, had an excellent room on the 7th floor. It had been recently refurbished with modern amenities including a large plasma TV. The Chinese Restaurant was excellent (but not cheap), we used the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks and the food was very good. All the staff we met were very pleasant and helpful. Spent an hour sat around the outside pool area, listening the noisy Delhi traffic. We did not venture far outside of the hotel on foot as there did not seem to be much to see, apart from some American fast food restaurants."
72,1622,"Jan 29 2006 	Better than the rest?	Just spent two nights in Delhi at the Crowne Plaza. On first impressions this is a good hotel, but delve beneath the surface and you'll find a few things that definitely lower the * ranking. Most of the rooms need refurbishing and the bar area has got to be the most inhospitable place in India! Forget any intimate surroundings, this bar is in the atrium with 30 m high ceilings. The breakfast is OK, but the restaurant is far too small to cope with a full house (which is nearly always in India). The location is also well removed from downtown. I'm sure there are better places to stay in Delhi."

1,1623,Everything awesome about it and its at a very low price	Now this is what is called a great hotel at a great location with the best price. I stayed in this hotel for two days and had booked a &quot;standard room' meant for two people due to non availability of a single occupancy during booking time (i know its a waste of resource ;) ). The rooms are awesome! Very much clean. The corridors and the waiting lounge was very comfortable as well. The bathroom was good too but with no bathtub :( (It does matter to some !). It seems that the commode was meant for those people with a height &gt;6.5 feet as when you have to use it your feet cannot touch the floor. (What the heck?) The hotel has a restaurant named Comesum which is a chain of restaurants tied up with IRCTC which serves amazing food which being tasty was hygienic at the same time. The best part was its location. Its located right next to the New Delhi railway station(NDLS). So if you are coming by train you could even walk to the hotel. For local travel the metro station is again at a walking distance in fact closer than NDLS.As far as my stay was concerned I faced no problems except for they don't allow to take your car near the portico and you have to take your luggage and walk for some distance (not much). It could be bothersome when one has a lot of luggage but shouldn't be a deciding factor according to me given the security issues which the country faces.All in all my stay was good and I don't see any reason why I should give anything less than five in ratings. The negatives i mentioned shouldnt be a deciding factor as far as I believe. thanks for reading....
2,1623,"Best Effort by Ratan Tata for the middle class	I found it extremely comfortable, very near to New Delhi Rly station travelling to the hotel by a cycle rickshow only. There is a metro entry just out side the hotel. A very good restaurant with a very reasonable price.If compared Room rent vs Cleanlilness , it will rank-1 in India. Normally the middle class cannot efford a lot of money in hotel, but desire cleanliness , a good restaurant etc, which is very well available in Zinger. It is also located extremely well convenient place. For Train Traveller, even better. Now onwards I even prefer to spend some money for this hotel to stay rather than choosing to free stay in our guest house in Noida.Thnak You Tata.Pankaj Kr Baruah"
3,1623,"best value for price	Very warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Best value for money"
4,1623,"Great quality for the price !! For train travelers it's PERFECTION!	The quality for price cannot be beat in Delhi - for $40 you get clean rooms with satelite TV, AC, wireless (must pay but only $5 for 24 hours) and clean bathrooms - perfectly comfortable rooms. We stayed at a few other hotels for the same price range in Delhi and India and found them all to be MUCH worse. We also stayed at a few 5 star hotels which were (as expected) better but then again cost us $300 ... found Ginger to be the best bargain around.Also - we traveled around quite a bit by train using delhi as a our main hub and for this the LOCATION CANNOT BE BEAT! you are literally across the street from the train station (VERY helpful since some tickets can only be bought 2 hourse before the train leaves - if the train leaves at 5am you'll be grateful you only have to cross the street to get your 3am tickets!). Its also pretty close to Connaught Place (central Delhi) - around 2 km or INR 50 by tuck tuck (1 dollar).Good luck! mp"
5,1623,"Nov 26 2009 	A Clean Hotel in Dirty Delhi	We had three one-night stays here as we used Delhi as a transit point for various excursions during our month-long holiday.The hotel's location, just yards from the unimaginable filth and detritus and all-round excremental disgrace that is the New Delhi Sewerage Station, I mean - New Delhi Railway Station, is undoubtedly very convenient.The large hotel is easy to see even at night time and even with luggage you can just walk across the car park that lies between the station and the hotel.With all the building work going on for the Commonwealth Games (Surely flattening the city would be a better option? After all, its been rebuilt several times already over the centuries!) it might look daunting to get to but walking is far quicker and cheaper than any tuk-tuk or taxi - as we found to our cost the first time we tried to get to it.We had three different rooms during our three stays and, despite reports from other contributors, we found each room clean in all respects with all the facilities you'd expect in a business hotel (albeit a budget hotel) including copious hot water.The 24-hour coffee shop / restaurant was fine - lots of well-dressed locals were even coming in for takeaways.Staff were pleasant and helpful but they won't store luggage so you'll have to use the Left Luggage Office at the station. Lock your bags and padlock them to the bays - thieves had a damn good go at attempting to break into my friend's suitcase.The hotel's location is also it's biggest problem. The AC can inevitably bring in the smells of the station but this isn't the hotel's fault, nor is the damn awful noise from the trains coming through the station whose horns even the deaf can hear! What is it with Indians and noise, anyway? Perhaps ask the hotel if it has rooms facing away from the station. Otherwise take ear (and possibly, nose) plugs.Anyway - the plus points are of the hotel's making and the minus points (apart from not storing luggage for late leavers) isn't.I would happily try other Ginger hotels. The only reason I wouldn't go back to their Delhi hotel is because it would mean my going back to Delhi. A more hellish scenario I cannot imagine."
6,1623,"Nov 26 2009 	Terrible place - Avoid it!!!	We booked Ginger Delhi for 2 days and left hotel with-in 2 hours of checking-in.My expectations were not great. I was looking for &quot;clean&quot; with no frills accommodation. But the room was far from being clean. There were bunch of long hairs on the floor. The hotel staff did not even check if the room was clean before handing over the room. When called housekeeping - they cleaned the room and only cleaned what we showed. After a second glance there were more bunch of hairs on the other side of the bed that the cleaner royally ignored.The walls had shoe prints. May be that previous guests wanted to make their footprints before they left. But at least I expected housekeeping to clean those marks from the wall. The quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over. When called the housekeeping to change the covers - they came with two quilt covers - one was dirty and the other was less dirty. We asked him to change the less dirty one.The hotel staff cared not to clean anything as they have enough guests who keep coming on the name of Ginger - The Taj Group.The bathroom was clean - but there was no hot water. You can fall sick if you would take cold shower in winters. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom. We had to call thrice to get the toilet paper.There was a very small window in the room and the room was damn compact. I would have appreciated if they could at least make a bigger window. That would have given the room a bigger look. Stay there only when you have no option (or may be when you just have to spend few hours) and keep your expectations level for a usual Pahargunj hotel for which you would pay not more than Rs 1000.We moved the same day to Quality Inn, Gurgaon and paid hefty amount for that hotel as it was the last minute booking but at least our stay was damn comfortable there.When complained to Ginger customer service - we only got the regret letter for the inconvenience caused and there was no refund.I would strongly advise to avoid this hotel. This is not the place where you can spend two days."
7,1623,"Nov 23 2009 	Centrally Located	Our journey to the Ginger Hotel didn't start too well. We booked a vehicle at the airport taxi counter. Once out of the airport our driver claimed he didn't know where the Ginger Hotel was located. We gave him a map but this didn't seem to help him. Fortunately, he could take us to the 'tourist office' who could phone Ginger for directions. The very 'helpful' man from the tourist office 'phoned' Ginger Hotel and was advised that they'd over-booked, but we could stay at their sister hotel for free! When we didn't believe this they passed the phone to us where the 'manager' apologised profusely and explained how the sister hotel was so much better. We still weren't convinced and realised it was a scam, and after we demanded that the taxi driver take us to the Ginger Hotel manager, we were given a ride to New Delhi railway station where we made our way on foot to the hotel. Of course we were immediately able to book in! When we were at the so-called 'tourist office' we saw other taxis pull up outside. The moral is that if you book a taxi from the airport then don't believe anything the driver, or anyone whose help he enlists, tells you about your hotel.The Ginger Hotel itself is quite bland but has clean rooms with comfortable beds and a TV for those who can't live without the box. They even have Wi-Fi (at a price) and there is a gym. Security is first class. There is a self-service cafeteria on site which provides exceptable food. The major downside was the booking process. We'd originally enquired about a room in August but it wasn't until 3 months later, 4 days before we were due to arrive, that the hotel was able to accept bookings. The only other problems were we were promised IT assistance when we experienced difficulties with the Wi-Fi connection, but this never arrived despite our phone calls, and there is no luggage storage facility at the hotel."
8,1623,"Nov 22 2009 	Best Place To Stay In Delhi	Ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India, mainly set up for business travellers, however if you are sick and tired of staying in terrible accomodation while travelling around India I would recommend paying a little extra and stay at a Ginger hotel. The Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city. The rooms are very clean, flat screen tv, air con, clean sheets, clean showers, nice staff and tea/coffee in room. Rooms have a tiny frindge which does not get very cold but otherwise well worth paying a few extra poung to stay at. I would recommend booking ahead on their web site if possible to get the best price."
9,1623,"Nov 16 2009 	value for money	was clean, and appeared safe. there was ample of room with clean bedding and hot water. additionally there is a good restaurant, business station and travel desk within the lodge. railway station is 5 min walk away."
10,1623,"Nov 16 2009 	What a place..	I say, friends, all those of u who want cleanliness, ginger new delhi can't be ur second choice... it was so calm, peaceful and so clean that at time i felt to leave the place never. So cheap and nearby to the station it was an amazing place to live in"
11,1623,"Nov 8 2009 	Great place for a solo traveler	This was a great place for a business trip. A spotlessly clean room, comfortable bed, bathroom and desk - plus wireless for an extra fee. I could also grab good, inexpensive food downstairs in the restaurant downstairs. Very key when I was pressed for time or needed to get something late at night and didn't feel safe heading out on my own after dark. This hotel has small rooms for 1 person which cost about half of a standard room, so perfect when traveling solo. Not great in terms of character but great if you just need a clean and safe place to sleep. If getting there by taxi, be sure to tell the driver it's by the Ajmeri Gate of the train station or they'll have a hard time finding it - and be sure to book at least a few weeks ahead of time. It books up, mostly by locals."
12,1623,Nov 6 2009 	Well worth the money	A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The restaurant is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system.
13,1623,"Oct 21 2009 	An excellent choice	This is an excellent choice and great value for the price. The room and bathroom were clean, A/C was great, flat screen TV with cable, hot water (though much better in morning than night), very cheap phone calls, internet in the lobby and very helpful staff. Restaurant is ok. If you check their website, it will show it fully booked for months to come. In reality, it seems to only take reservations in the short term. Excellent location right next to the New Delhi Station. although everyone will have a tough time finding it. Tell them to go to the New Delhi Station and then ask for the Rail Yatri Niwas. If you are walking, you have to walk through a dark, crowded industrial area to get to the hotel and solo women may not feel comfortable. Otherwise, highly recommended."
14,1623,"Oct 21 2009 	excellent value for Delhi	Stayed one night at the beginning and one night at the end of our two week holiday. Support majority of positive comments already made about value, cleanliness and convenience. At the end of a long train journey the convenience of being able to walk to the Ginger Hotel was a great asset. The restaurant was nothing great but it's only one stop by Metro (entrance very close to the hotel) to Connaught Circus where there are plenty eating places. Would definitely stay there."
15,1623,"Oct 19 2009 	Good value for the money	I was quite satisfied with my stay here. I stayed here my very first 2 nights in Delhi and on the trip. The hotel is basic but clean enough. Room has complimentary water (2 bottles a day), hot water pot, TV. Right now I can't even picture the bathroom but I was fine with the room and bathroom. There are 2 computers available in the lobby for Rs 110 for 1 hr. The staff was friendly and means to be helpful. One just has to give them time. I agree with the other reviews here in terms of the value for the money.The location was great for going to Old Delhi and Connaught Circle. Also, because it is next to the railroad station, the pre-paid taxi driver from airport knew how to get to it. There is a large sign up high so once at the station you can see it. There is construction around the station and you actually need to go to the back of the station to reach the hotel.A short walk from the hotels gets you to a pre-paid stand where you can hire auto-rickshaws. There is a booking agent (of sorts) in the hotel so I used them to book a car to the airport for the next leg of my trip. I said I would take non-AC for Rs800 and I got a car with AC.One negative was trying to book a room online. I did use direct email to the Delhi Ginger hotel but they don't book much in advance and they also get full quickly.Hope this helps."
16,1623,"Oct 7 2009 	Everything we wanted and nothing more!	What can one get in New Delhi for 1000 rupees?The price, the location and the Tata brand were my main consideration when I booked Ginger for our 3 night stay in New Delhi. The location is amazing - bang next to the railway station. Yet so peaceful, as if away from the city.Once I got into the hotel, I didn't see a porter running towards me to pick up my baggage. Instead there were some super convenient trolleys - self-service is the mantra here.The room is not of a five-star quality but just of the right size and has everything one needs. In the common area, there is facility to iron your clothes. Amazingly designed to save costs and yet not compromise on the comfort of the stay.There is no room service, but you could pack your food from the restaurant and carry it yourself."
17,1623,"Oct 3 2009 	Perfect place for family	An excellent hotel strategically located with very good Customer Service. The cost of the food in the Restaurant is little higher which TATA need to relook at, as they have opened this Hotel in the Railway Station Complex and not inside/ near Airport."
18,1623,"Sep 30 2009 	Can't ask for more - Real value for money	Hats off to TATA for gifting us Ginger , Delhi. I booked this place after reading several reviews , but when I stayed there it exceeded my expectation. Positives : 1. Spacious and spick and span rooms for just Rs.999/night2. LCD TV3. Very neat toilet/shower4. Complementary mineral water ( 4 small bottles on daily basis)5. Centrally located - Connaught Place outer circle is hardly 1 km. CP is the best place to dine.6. 24hrs restaurant7. Water dispenser on every floor8. Very courteous staff including room service staff.These were just to name a few.Negatives :1. No auto stand in front of the hotel ( got to walk abt 50 mts)2. Restaurant not that great. They are not capable of handling more than 4 customers at a time. I had to wait for 1 hr to grab my breakfast. I suggest that you have food here only if unavoidable.3. The travel desk has very few Indica A/Cs. It has more bigger cars ,which are more expensive. Indica A/C Rs.850 / 8hrs-80kms ,but Esteem - Rs.600 more.Otherwise no complaints. I think Ginger should open similar hotels in Mumbai also.Wish you a very happy stay.Rgds,Venkatesh"
19,1623,"Sep 28 2009 	Value For Money	Real Value For Money hotel . An ac room at rs 999 . neat room well maintained . Has coffee / Tea maker , complimentary water bottle . Rs 999 is an steal ."
20,1623,"Sep 10 2009 	Descent hotel at excellent price	I was travelling to Delhi from Mumbai and this hotel came as a surprise choice after me completing the train ticket on irctc.co.inI was directed to www.railtourismindia.com and booking of this hotel was easy. Thought what services would I find for 1K room.Went to the hotel and voila, its an excellent located hotel (Central Delhi). Rooms are well maintained, lobby is good.They don't serve food in the rooms, but Comsum restaurent at the lobby provides yet another surprise. Good hygenic food at very good price.Overall very good experience."
21,1623,"Aug 31 2009 	LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH......	We were on the way to Kerala and stayed here in a twin room. This was really a great beginning of Honeymoon. Clean and comfortable rooms with a multi-cuisine restaurant made our trip wonderful. We strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families. One of the best thing is the easy access of railway station. You can even see your train standing at platform no. 10, 11 and 12 while having west side window opening rooms."
22,1623,"Aug 21 2009 	good value for money	This hotel is just steps from the New Delhi train station. It has clean rooms, comfortable beds and decent bathrooms at very reasonable prices. The area around the station does look a bit intimidating but I never felt in danger, even late at night. The restaurant offers good and safe food at very competitive prices."
23,1623,"Aug 18 2009 	My most preferred hotel economical	Ginger (Yatri Nivas) New Delhi, I recommend this hotel because its clean, the staffs are very polite, No disturbance, Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of 3 star hotel. The rooms are very clean, the toilets are also clean. Clean bedsheets, towels, wifi, A/C. Really a comfortable place to stay and at the heart of New Delhi. The metro is just a 50 meter walk from the hotel. Isn't it Great !!!"
24,1623,"Aug 15 2009 	THE best Value in Delhi for your money - period --	Great hotel with everything you need - mini fridge, flat panel TV , 4 beds in family room , free water bottles , separate shower,toilet,washbasin ( saves time when you have a family getting ready in morning ).Nice restaurent downstairs, WIFI for approx $8/24 hrs , pharmacy , book store next door etc .Just keep this quite guys - already too tough to get a room @ this place - seriously when I travel in India I am going to look for a Ginger hotel everywhere I go ."
25,1623,Aug 4 2009 	Noce Place But Not too Good	I visited this place on my Recent visit to New Delhi. This hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard. I know this is a budget hotel but the quality is not soo good. I have also visited the Bangalore Ginger hotel but this one in Delhi is not so good. Though rooms are neat and clean but the area where this is located is not good at all. Also there is not any room service at all. So this is also a problem.
26,1623,"Jun 29 2009 	The Best Hotel In Delhi	After so much hassle in Raunak hotel,it was a relief to come to Ginger Hotel.I always searched for 3-4stars hotel.But after seeing the 3-star Raunak Hotel,i didn't want to anymore.Even though Ginger hotel is a budget hotel,it is the best value for money.The service was good,the food was splendid,the room was spacious and clean,the staff were very helpful and understanding.I really enjoyed my stay there. ..I really look forward to another enjoyable stay there!!!"
27,1623,"Jun 24 2009 	Fabulous hotel great location for the railway station and VFM	Stayed here on 2 separate occasions during March and rate the hotel very highly. Its location is walking distance from New Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at 6 in the morning. The area around the hotel does not win any awards, in fact some parts look well dodgy, especially late at night. The hotel however has a security check point and they do actually check people coming into the hotel so no problems there. The rooms are very clean, modern looking, have a good air conditioning system, flat screen TV's, good hot showers and comfortable beds. Best of all the rooms are very inexspensive. There is a cafeteria down in the lobby area that serves various meals and drinks, the food is reasonable and good value."
28,1623,"Jun 21 2009	Best place in Delhi to stay	The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. What I say that &quot;Best place in Delhi to stay&quot;"
29,1623,Jun 21 2009 	Best hotel near New Delhi railway station	I had to take a train at 3:40 AM. So I was looking for a hotel which should be at a walking distance from NDLS station. The hotels at paharganj looked shabby. But Ginger hotel (The erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas) is very nice hotel. The interiors are very good. The hotel uses latest technologies loke self check in etc. The room rates are also resonabel at around 1200 Rs. I would certainly recommed this hotel if you are looking for stay near new delhi railway station.
30,1623,"Jun 19 2009 	Budget hotel in India	I'm a Brazilian living in Bangalore, and May this year my family came to visit me and my wife. I planned the visit to New Delhi and Agra, so I booked on-line two double rooms. Two weeks before I called to check if the reservations were really made, luckily it was! :) Finding this hotel is complicated, and if you're a foreigner, no taxi driver will believe you know where it is (even you have a map in your hands). Tell the driver that its next to Pinto Road, and that he has to go through the rail station car/rickshaws parking area to get to the hotel.The location is pretty good to visit the sites in New Delhi.This is a budget hotel, so dont expect any frills. Youll find a bed, AC (little noisy), LCD TV, a desk with a small fridge and a standard western bathroom. Our towels were a little dirty and the bed sheets where smaller than the bed, even thou cleaner than some 4 star hotels Ive stayed in Pune, Chennai and Mumbai.Theres a 24 hours restaurant in the ground floor, if you like Indian food youre going to enjoy yourself. If you dont you can get an auto-rickshaw for 5-10 minutes and go to Connaught Place to eat something. The hotel does have omelette and toast.The hotel does deliver what it promises, a safe and clean place to sleep. If youre looking for some glamour try other hotels, but if you dont want to spend money, this should prove good enough."
31,1623,"Jun 18 2009 	yes yes yes!	Even if it is not easy to get there (you can see it from the railway station but the road is not direct) we've found it very very worthy. Room is basic but clean, Wi-fi everywhere for 113 rupies per hour, the restaurant always open, not expensive and average quality food, just outside the door a pharmacy and a corner shop. Also a tourist desk is there, and their car rental with driver service is good and not expensive at all, compared to the others we checked. We will sure look for a Ginger hotel everywhere we'll go in India!"
32,1623,"Jun 13 2009 	A good base in Delhi	The Ginger is cheap, clean and comfortable.The air conditioning was welcome after the May heat of the city. We tried a 4 bed family room and the 2 bed twins, both fine, the twins have better bathrooms.The 24 hour cafe downstairs was useful, not the best food ever but adequate with a fair amount of choice.Tell cab drivers you need New Delhi station, Ajmeri Gate as others have noted they often don't know where the hotel is with just the name. The surroundings aren't wonderful but it is very convenient, the metro is just outside.Would definitely base myself here again. Good for families."
33,1623,"Jun 13 2009 	Budget at its best	Hotel Ginger is a quality accomodation and a steal for the low prices that it offers. The fact that the building belongs to the Railways and was a Rail Yatri Niwas may have a major role to play in its pricing.But the makeover is unbelievable. Simple changes have made the hotel a great buy-in for business travellers who visit the hotel only for a good night's sleep.The rooms are very tiny but well done up. The corridors are a maze but blame it on the old building and construction.Currently accessibility from the city is a big problem because of the construction of Metro, but once that ends this hotel will be a hot favourite for people travelling by the Railways.Ginger provides option of ordering food from any local restaurant nearby and also makes available their menu cards, which is a great option if you want to choose from a variety of cuisine.All in all a value for money!"
34,1623,"Jun 12 2009 	excellent value for the money	Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I booked four nights at the Ginger Hotel in May and was not disappointed. The hotel provides excellent value for the money. I paid more than double for the same setup at another hotel when I returned to Delhi in June. The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. Service is snappy and professional. While all this doesn't sound that exciting, trust me when I say that you'll be really thankful for such efficient service when you arrive at 4AM after being given the runaround by your taxi driver. The hotel is sort of hard to find. It's on the back side and across the tracks from New Delhi Station. Adjacent to the hotel is some sort of operations which involves lots of bales and carts and looks like recycling activity but is probably rail related freight operations. It's not pretty to look at, but the constant activity makes the area relatively safe, and once inside the hotel, all is nice and calm. You get courtesy bottles of water every day. There's internet access, albeit with a slow connection and expensive at 113 rupees an hour. And the restaurant isn't too bad. There's a metro very near by. If Delhi weren't so beastly hot, the hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place and Old Delhi. The place always seems to be booked, so book early."
35,1623,"Jun 10 2009 	romantic rooms	The hotel is magnificent . It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go anywhere. It;s ambience is so peaceful, no disturbance at all from anyone .  In delhi, with such a atmosphere you can not find hotel at such a reasonable rates. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel in the price range of Rs 1000/- per day. It is in the heart of delhi hence transportation is no problem at all. ONly negative point is its' entrance through New delhi Rly station which is little crowdy, but one you in it all peaceful, neat and clean rooms with very good aesthatics"
36,1623,"Jun 6 2009 	Nice cute place	We were scheduled to travel to Agra and planned to stop by at Delhi for a couple of business meetings. My brother was trying for hotel accomodation through the internet. He had a fancy for Ginger hotels and kept trying for a room from 1 month before our visit. He did not get one initially. But on repeated attempts, there appears to have been a cancellation and he was able to book a room.The hotel is just a stone's throw from the railway station. We flew down and took a taxi to the Station. We just walked over the platform into the hotel. We got an unbelievable price and when we walked into the hotel, the warm reception at the desk and the manners of the staff in the reception reminded us that this was a Tata hotel. Absolutely friendly, courteous and professional!When we went into the room, we saw a beautiful room with a spacious bathroom. It was an unbelievable facility for the price at this location. A tea kettle with coffee and tea packs was provided in the room.In case you get hungry, there is a restaurant in the groundfloor that offered food and beverage round the clock and we had arrived late at night without food and helped ourselves to a good tasty dinner there.A nice hotel at a very convenient place. But if you are planning to stay there, please make sure that you book a room well in advance."
37,1623,"Jun 3 2009 	for young independent travellers	Very clean place to sleep and have a spot in the city. Do not expect a lot. Rooms are small, claustrophobic, with single window fully covered by AC machine. Older, old-fashioned ppl are really confused when they have to deal with card locks and all those modern tools. The area around the hotel isn't too safe, quiet or clean. It is just near the New Delhi station so u can imagine all that mess around and how is it at night. But one good thing is that u have a metro station just at the corner and 24hr Comsume in it. Food isn't great but safe."
38,1623,Jun 3 2009 	Complete VFM	Nothing but the best Value for Money.Easily the best option for all kind of travellers.Id give it 5/5
39,1623,"Jun 3 2009 	Best Hotel at the Best Rate	We used to visit Delhi quite often and it use to be a very difficult task to find a decent hotel at a decent price. Then the last time I was planning my trip to Delhi, I learnt that Ginger had opened in New Delhi and that to it is right next to the NEw Delhi Railway Station and so I booked Ginger. The hotel is very neat and clean and for the price I think one cannot get a better deal. They also have a restaurant, laundry service, LCD TVs in each room, etc. I think this hotel is a steal in Delhi for the price they are offering."
40,1623,"Jun 2 2009 	Good value for money	Good value for money. The family room contains 4 beds. With AC, pretty spacious room with LCD TV for 1000 is too good. Also proximity the New Delhi railway station is BIG plus. Now don't have to go for the infamous Pahadganj hotels.Only issue was with respect to booking. I had done day visit booking with checkin and checkout dates as same. I had some trouble (had to wait for almost 1 hour) to get the room. And the reception staff and the manager were not polite to say the least."
41,1623,"Jun 1 2009 	Convenient Location	A good value, conveniently located hotel next to the Metro and New Delhi Railway Station.It is located on the North East side of the Railway Station, taxi drivers might find difficulty in locating it!I had already checked it out on Google Earth and so we directed the taxi driver!The staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate. Hey, it is a budget hotel.We stayed four nights and the room was well cleaned every day.Yes, I would certainly return here, particularly if I was travelling by rail.Oh, there is also a pharmacy next to the hotel."
42,1623,"May 31 2009 	if you can only find this hotel...	This was one of my worst experiences!!! I finished a whole days work in delhi &amp; had to return to this hotel in the night. The arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai. I tired calling the hotel serveral times during the day to inform them that i have arrived &amp; will be checking in only later that day, only in vain as no one answered the phone all throght the day.When i left to head to the hotel we reched the new delhi railway station, but NO ONE seemed to know where this hotel was located. I tried calling them up one again. As there was no answer &amp; since it was 12:30am i began to panick &amp; called a colleague in mumbai for some assistance. He gave me the same nos to dial but again all was in vain as no one answered.After almost 1.5hrs I finally managed to ask around &amp; we got to the hotel. I was furious. As i walked in i realised that there was absoluteley no one at the front desk, the phone too was ringing after looking around the front desk executive came &amp; asked : can i help you&quot; I gave him a piece of my mind &amp; asked him what kind of a hotel do you run. This was a chain affiliated with the TATA group.i the went to my room apart frm my bad experience, this a budget hotel costing apprx 1000rs. a night. There is no room service or house keeping. You have to dine a self service restaurant. The food is similar to your meals alavailable at a food court in any mall in mumbai. The food is average for the price.If you have a low budget then this is the place for you, if you can find it!!"
43,1623,"May 22 2009 	Great hotel with excellent value	We enjoyed staying at the Ginger, New Delhi. The rooms are compact, very clean and every small detail is taken care of (including complimentary bottles of water every day, wifi in each room, internet cafe etc) and the facilities are managed well.Food is available at the 24-hr coffee shop at the ground level. The service here is very slow though the food is nice. Pre-paid auto-rickshaws are available at the New Delhi railway station which is a 3 minute walk away and the metro station is 3 minutes away as well. The only issue is that auto will drop you off a 3-5min walk away on the return since the metro work has made the entire road difficult to enter."
44,1623,May 20 2009 	Value for money hotel	Good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two. The facilities are minimal but adequate.
45,1623,"May 20 2009	Great Value For Money	We traveled BOM-DEL by Rajdhani Express. The hotel is just oppositte the New Delhi Railway station within the station premises. Its a fine 7 storeyed building with no frills and no excellent views from hotel room. BUT it offers great value for your money.We took a family room for just INR 1000. The room had 2 window AC's, 4 single beds. The entire room was very neat and tidy. Toilets were clean. Everything worked to perfection. Any other property in New Delhi offering what this hotel offers would easily cough up 2000-3000 bucks from your pocket.Seamless check-in and check-out procedure. Nice room service. 4 bottles of mineral water and tea and coffee kits provided on a daily basis. A nice 17 inch LCD TV to take care of your entertainment needs. The quality of the beds, mattresses is very nice.The restaurant offers a very limited menu. It is something which can be improved upon."
46,1623,May 18 2009 	Best business class hotel in Mumbai	Ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for a frequent business traveler like me.They best advantage with Ginger Delhi is its location advantage.The facilities provided by the hotel are above average.I specially like the Ginger concept and now I am a fan of it.I will definitely stay with Ginger next time I am in India's capital soon.
47,1623,May 11 2009 	love the staff commitments towards service..............	it was a gud exp.. been serviced by the ginger mgt....at the cost tat i iccured i can't even imagine a service like the one i got ..................its true to say tata as the most trustable brand of world................
48,1623,May 9 2009 	Decent place - low cost	Decent place- reasonably clean and located next to the railway station.. Remember it is a budget hotel so a few things one should keep in minda) Carry your toiletries!b) Food is available but is in a cafeteria like place Had a few issues with them messing up over the bedsheets but was otherwise ok
49,1623,"May 9 2009 	A Good Basic Transit Hotel	A Basic Service Hotel, right next to New Delhi Railway Station , we took a 4 Bedded Family Room as were travelling with 2 Kids and wanted a Hotel Near Railway station as we were transitting next day to Goa by Flight.As we had seen Ginger in Haridwar and Goa and were impressed with the cleanliness chose this hotel.Very Nice Hotel, Location was bit bad due to Metro work on in the near vicinity , The Railway station Parcel office etc making it very noisy and dusty. But once inside it was nice.Rooms needed a little bit more care (by guests as well as by staff). On checkin found that Soap dispenser was empty and was taken away bu housekeping who forgot to replace it. The Toilet seat is installed too High making it uncomfortable. The size of the Toilet was too small. They should have selected better wc to fit the size.Linen was good, amenities Ok, size perfect, Restaurant at the Lobby level was good, economical and good.Best part is that you can go anywhere from here due to its central Location."
50,1623,"May 8 2009 	best budget hotel in new delhi	in new delhi, in area near to railway station, ginger is not only best budget hotel but with most professional management.compare to other hotels in same area with same price tag, it is the best one, all facilities like taxi, food, shopping is available nearby."
51,1623,May 2 2009 	loved the ambience	the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities.and that too economical. jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained..
52,1623,"Apr 29 2009 	Basic - but does exactly what you need for 1 night	We initially booked this as we were going to be catching a train from Corbett National Park into New Delhi station (2 minute walk away). However we ended up catching a taxi from Corbett instead and our driver had all sorts of problems trying to get to the front door and ended up parking in a nearby car park! It's not in the nicest of areas, I definitely wouldn't advise walking around on your own at night.It is a standard stopover hotel, like a Travelodge or a Premier Inn in the UK. It's a pretty basic room, but has most that you need with air con, flat screen tv, tea, coffee and water. It's clean, the check in and out were simple and there's a restaurant/cafe downstairs. It's unbelievably cheap at about 14 for a night and with the money we saved here we went for drinks and dinner at The Imperial Hotel."
53,1623,"Apr 23 2009 	good price	what I like about this hotel is the central location, and the attractive price for room it provides.It is basic, yet, it has what you need, and it is clean enough, although they do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat"
54,1623,Apr 23 2009 	Well worth the Money	A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The resteraunt is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system.
55,1623,Apr 19 2009 	Decent	The hotel is decent &amp; as per Ginger standards. The rooms are good&amp; clean. Its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station or arives these late at night. On the negative side its in the congested &amp; poluted area of station &amp; u cant step out for a snack or stroll if u desire.
56,1623,"Apr 18 2009 	Inexpensive but know what you're getting into	My friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money. It came highly recommended by my friend's coworkers in Bombay. However, we ended up not staying there. On the drive there, our driver muttered in Hindi that 'cheaters go there'. Then, as we waited to check in, the fellow customers, all men, started casually inching closer to my friends and me. We were a group of 3 20-something women, and two of us are white. While we may very well have been perfectly fine, it would have been nice to know about the area and clientele before we booked the room. Later in the week, my friend reconnected with a friend from Delhi who told us it's located in the Red Light district. That reaffirmed our choice to return to Claridges.Couples, men, families - I'm sure it's a great deal. Women traveling without male companions... it might be prudent to stay elsewhere."
57,1623,Apr 17 2009 	Good Place	Good place for a 2-3 days leisure time. The room service was quick and the food was satisfactory. The rooms were neat &amp; clean.I would recommend to the viewers to stay at this place.
58,1623,"Apr 16 2009 	Purely Smart Basics !!	Loved my stay here. Hotel is clean &amp; proper. Has a good restaurant as well.Rooms are self sufficient, though small if you are looking at spending more than 3 days here.Staff is extremely helpful.Located right in the Delhi Railway Station premise, so good for Train travellers. At the same time, it's away from the hustle-bustle of the train travellers at the station.However, the entrance is a little dificult to locate the 1st time around. Entrance way is crowded as well, if coming via car.Also, if you are a very light sleeper, then the Honking of the night train can disturb you. But less likely. I slept like a LOG !!General store cum Medical store in Hotel complex is fully equipped, and is priced at MRP.Overall good experience for a one-2 nite stay for work."
59,1623,"Mar 31 2009 	Great value and excellent location	Ginger was just what we needed for the final 3 nights of our 3 1/2 week stay in India.It was basically an Indian travelodge, so don't bother staying if you want an authentic heritage experience, but the room was immaculate (by western standards rather than Indian) and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities, TV, comfy bed, AC, etc.The location just outside New Delhi station was perfect for arriving/departing via the station, within walking distance of Paharganj and Connaught place, and a short metro ride to Old Delhi's main attractions (Red Fort, mosque, etc.) The 24 hour restaurant came in handy for our day trip to Agra and early morning flight back to London - staff at reception were also happy to ring for a metered cab to the airport when the travel desk in the foyer tried to charge us 1200Rs to get to the airport!At 990Rs a night, this was slightly expensive than other hotels we stayed in in India but worth every penny."
60,1623,"Mar 16 2009 	Excellent value but a bit of a nightmare outside	It's an Indian TravelLodge. So excellent value for money, good clean room with a/c and good clean bathroom but basic decor and a bit echoey in the corridors. The restaurant / snack bar is good (try the plain dosa). It is a short trundle across the car park and through a little gateway from New Delhi railway station. You can't leave your luggage before / after check-in but there's a rather forbidding left luggage place in the station. The hotel has a perimeter fence and a security guard. Immediately outside, you're in a horrendous noisy tide of hand carts, jeeps, motorbikes etc - or you can hit lucky and find it pretty quiet. Getting in is OK if the taxi knows the circuitous route to the entrance. Otherwise, they'll drop you right by the building and it is quite a challenge to find the way in. Expensive internet."
61,1623,"Mar 15 2009 	Very nice and clean hotel but the restaurant	Very nice clean hotel with good room facilities, good location just at Ajmeri gate 100m from NDRS and metro, nice stuff - willing to fully refund one mine canceled night, but also sometimes act too bureaucratically. Hotel restaurant is a different story. It works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu. Same with fruit salad."
62,1623,"Mar 11 2009 	Exceptional value in a big city!	We stayed for two nights early March and then again a week later. Both times the rooms were immaculate, we stayed in a double room costing just 999 rupees per night, the rooms are equipped with Satellite TV, kettle, tea and coffee, fridge, celan bathroom with shower curtain, these are a rarity in India! We had a problem with our toliet on the second visit but maintenance were at the door almost as soon as we had put the phone down from calling reception, and the problem was rectified.The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from New Delhi station which makes it perfect for early morning train journeys. We too had a problem with a taxi driver not knowing where the hotel was, but we also had a tuk-tuk driver who didn't know where Connaught Place was?!?!? The staff in the hotel are really helpful and work really hard to keep everyone happy, they even called Domino's pizza for us as we were having trouble with their pay phone."
63,1623,"Feb 28 2009 	Value hotel in a good location	Good value hotel, Clean rooms very close to the train station. good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney."
64,1623,"Feb 21 2009 	Absolute value for money no frills located right next to Railway station	A Compact small room with wooden flooring, clean bathroom, with a telephone, air-conditioner and a cupboard with hangers was all for Rs 999. A standard room means a Queen side double bed, whereas a twin bed room are two separate beds. There is also a category with four beds at the same price if there are more people! The rooms are small, and one could compare this with Ibis in Europe, only that dust in India makes it harder to keep the property as clean. But no complaints.There is a restaurant at the ground floor (Comesum) which serves decent food options. The location is excellent, next to the Railway station and to Connaught place, N Delhi. When we stayed, there was lots of metro rail construction happening around the hotel which made access slightly round-about. However, we could walk to the railway station early morning strolling our bags on our own (there are baggage strolleys available in the hotel restricted till the main entrance of the hotel) in about 7 minutes.The laundry service was reasonable and prompt - deposit in the morning and receipt by evening 8 pm.We booked online and check was easy too. There is a helpful reception desk. The hotel is quite busy due to the price and location, and one needs to bear with that.Overall, a comfortable and convenient stay."
65,1623,"Feb 11 2009 	good value for Rs 1200	I stayed here once alone and once with my wife in January 2009 for Rs 1200. Overall a good hotel but there is a problem in getting taxi drivers to find it. Most dont recognize the address whether spoken or written down. But I eventually go there on every ride, with perhaps a ten minute delay. It is a forty-five minute car ride to and from the airports, dont use a rickshaw. Rooms were Spartan but spotless on both visits. The lobby was slightly less clean yet more than adequate for a quick stop over in Delhi. The restaurant had reasonable food and prices (Rs 60-100/entre), but the menu was limited during any given meal."
66,1623,"Feb 7 2009 	Ginger Hotel	Our stay at the Ginger Hotel was great. Forget expensive bed and breakfast hotels, the Ginger Hotel is a no frills, and a great hotel. Our family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms as the family room (1000INR) was totally booked. We stayed in a double and 2 singles rooms (1000INR each) for 3 days. We arrived at the hotel which is located next to the NDLS railway station. It was chaotic outside. We approached the hotel gates, security didn't let the car through (security check), we got off, and headed towards the lobby. Check in was a bit of pain as Indians don't understand getting in line to get attention. We were soon given our room keys and went upstairs. We but our bags in the trolly. THe rooms were clean, and had the basic necessities. 4 water bottles inside the room. Heater and AC were part of the room w/ remote control. TV was LCD. Internet was expensive but we didn't care as we were at the hotel to only catch night sleep. THe floor consisted of an iron table in the hallway. THe hotel at the lobby is superb. Order watever you want as they are open 24 hrs, indian/chineses/western and is clean. We ate dinner here every night as we were sure not to get sick. THe hotel also has a gym and meeting room. Newspaper free at lobby. No outside noise was noticibly. Pick this hotel if you want a inexpensive 3.5 star service. It's centrally located to all monuments, and shopping areas are a taxi drive away. Since it's located near the train statin catching a taxi/or a 3 wheeler was a breeze. Walk outside the gate and towards the train station, there you will find an office for the 3 wheelers. Tell them where you want to go and you will prepay your trip. No negotiating. For taxi, the black taxis are outside too but here you have to talk to the drivers. We took a taxi to the airport for 400INR but all intercity trip to visitor monuments/shopping were done in tuktuk (3 wheelers). Would I stay here? In a heartbeat. Save the money and use that on shopping. You are on vacation and will use the bed for only night 8 hrs of sleep anyway. I spent 3500INR for a bed and breakfast hotel on the last stay which was pathetic (house of lords), spend the money at Ginger. Make sure you prebook online if you want the Family room (4 ppl for 1000INR) as it's in HOT demand. We couldn't get the deal so we took the regular rooms for 2 at 1000INR each which is still great. Staff is super friendly, will go out of the way to help. They've even got a ground transportation group at the lobby but I thought they were expensive. A medical store exists in the lobby as well. Request a room in the higher floors for a greater view. See pics of the location. This is a gem in the city no doubt. Coming into a foreign country from the US is a headache but staying at Ginger will calm the situation a LOT."
67,1623,"Feb 6 2009 	Great value for Money	Stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in January 2009 with friends. There were 3 of us, so we got the Family room which has 4 beds for Rs.1000/nightThe stay was comfortable and just what it advertised itself as - a no frills hotel. Though service at the hotel was good, there were areas for improvement. 1. The hotel provides only 2 towels in a room meant for 4 persons and you need to ask them for extra towels. The towels could be of better quality - they shed threads which stuck all over!2. Wifi/Internet access is expensive at Rs.130/hour compared to internet rates elsewhere3. The room key card repeatedly stopped working and meant a trip to the lobby each time to fix it!On the positive side,The staff was very polite and helpful. The 24 hour cafe is convenient, especially when you need to leave at odd hours of the night. The food wasn't bad either :)Having a metro station at your doorstep is really usefulThe beds were very comfortable or maybe I was just really tired. The location of the hotel near the New Delhi Railway Station and Metro station is convenient BUT it also means that road access to the hotel can be confusing, as it is in an area surrounded by a parking lot and a railway parcel area.Overall, if you aren't going to spend a lot of time in your hotel room and just need a comfortable, safe and clean place to spend the night Ginger is the place for you, but don't expect a full service hotel. There are still a few kinks they need to iron out but the helpful staff fixes any problems quickly.I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Delhi."
68,1623,Feb 5 2009 	Good Hotel	Hotel was good and neat and clean. As I presume they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well. I guess they can modify those a bit. The toilets and the bath does not have any buckets or mugs. If you have a kid you are in for some trouble with that. No room service or bell boys are there. Not a bad choice for a stay next to NDLS station
69,1623,"Jan 16 2009 	Great value for a family of 4	We stayed in 12/2008 twice for 2 nights each in a family room which sleeps 4. The first time the room was not very clan - but the second time it was. Great location - great price (INR 1000 per night). If you check in later or check out earlier they automatically give you a reimbursement. The surrounding area is not recommended to go for a walk.Due to heavy construction work and proximity to the railway station it does get loud if you wish to keep the window open. There are however 2 A/Cs in the family room and 2 fans.The 24 hour restaurant in the basement is OK - its clean and has a wide variety of dishes: southindian, north indian, even blackforest cherry cake ;-)The car rental service in the hotel is however a rip-off. Book your transport elsewhere. Staff is friendly and helpful. You can also get your clothes washed there. Internet access works most of the time."
70,1623,"Jan 12 2009 	Nice enough close to New Delhi railway station	We pre-booked a room in Ginger hotel for our first night in Delhi. The taxi driver had serious problems to get to the hotel as the hotel is next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station. However, he got us there and we were greeted by the friendly staff. Our room on the 5th floor wasn't that spacious but nice. Clean sheets, flatscreen TV and complimentary bottles of water as well as teabags and coffee. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest we have ever seen but good enough. As we were leaving for Rajasthan, we decided to spend one more night a week later. We asked the front desk staff upon checkout about making a reservation for that night. They said that there were rooms available. However, they could not make the reservation - we had to do it through the Ginger website... To use their internet access, we would have to pay more than a 100 rs for a wireless card. (1 hour costs about 35-40 rs at any internet caf in town)The next time we came to Delhi, we found out that the metro is extremely close to the hotel, about 25 metres from the hotel gate. There is however no metro sign so you have to ask the guard to show you the direction. Ginger hotel is also very close to the railway station which is convenient for early morning departures but also causes noice at night. The hotel isn't five-star but for the price, it's definitely recommended!"
71,1623,"Jan 10 2009 	RESERVATION NOT HONORED- left stranded	My friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didn't honor her reservation. They had record of the reservation but there were no rooms available. It's the middle of the night, her first trip to India and I'm here in the US desperately trying to google some kind of alternative. So...BE CAREFUL. Double check that they are ready for you. Otherwise it's a great place to stay."
72,1623,"Jan 9 2009	Great value for money with few kinks	As an NRI family from USA, including 2 teenagers , and traveling in India for the first time, we were a little apprehensive about our Indian travel agent's recommendation re this hotel. However, overall experience for our 2 rooms over 5 nights turned out to be excellent . We checked in at 3AM on 12/19 and checked out on 12/24 without any problems. They gave us partial credit for the 1st night, which was a pleasant surprise. Access to the hotel is cumbersome, but since we had hired a private car with a driver, this was not a problem for us.Best things were front desk svc, 24hr restaurant (cheap, lots of variety, mild food, good svc), laundry svc, cleanliness, uninterrupted hot and cold running water, free water bottles, free tea &amp; coffee, and access to a safe. We did not miss not having room service. Although the family room does have 4 beds, it is very small and quickly got congested with all our baggage. So our decision to book 2 rooms, and have access 2 bathrooms and extra space turned out be a good one. The biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc; e.g. some days we got only 1-2 towels or no TP for 4 people; one day no svc at all. They always fixed the problem promptly upon complaining, but it did not have to be this way. The only other issue was night time noise at the Rlwy Stn, which we drowned out by running the A/c fan without the A/c. Also, WiFi broke the 2nd day and never got fixed, even though they said it would be fixed within a couple of hours - a problem not unique to Ginger, but commonly encountered in India.If you want a 5 star hotel, Ginger is not for you. But I would definitely recommend this hotel to any family that wants basic modern value for money."
73,1623,"Jan 8 2009 	Good value for money and good location	Stayed at the Ginger New Delhi, mainly because of the location - it was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it.Overall, it was really good value for money, clean hotel and friendly staff.ROOM - room was an adequate size, wooden flooring and clean. The bathroom was a wet room but I found the toilet was a little high - such that when you were sat on the loo, your legs wouldn't touch the floor :-)The complimentary water provided in the room was really good and a nice touch.SERVICE - there was a restaurant bolted next door to the hotel with access from the hotel which served food which was great as it meant we didn't have to start hunting around for breakfast.LOCATION - it was very conveniently positioned which was handy as we were catching the 0615 train to Agra so we just had to hop out of bed, and walk to the train. The location meant that you could hear the station announcements and was noisy at times, but we were in a city after all, so noise was expected. Ear plugs are something I now carry with me at all times!OTHER - there was a little room which had complimentary water, iron and ironing board, and newspapers which was nice to have.COST - very good value for money - can't fault this hotel on this!Overall, I would definitely stay again, great little hotel, clean, good value for money - what more to do need! By no means was it the Ritz but it was functional - just what we needed!"
74,1623,"Jan 5 2009 	A good value hotel in Delhi	I choose this hotel after extensive research of hotels in Delhi.The thing that finally swung it for me, was that is was cheap.The selection of hotels in Delhi swings from the cheap to the ridiclious.The Ginger seemed to be a hotel that served the purpose of being a safe,clean bed for a couple of nights.We flew in from Goa, for a couple of days of sightseeing, a day trip to Agra and then onward to Jaipur.This hotel was adequate for that purpose.The good points were, clean rooms, serviced daily, on site 24hrs cafe, close to the new delhi railway station, great for catching the shatbadi express at 06.15 to AgraThe bad points, the construction work of the metro makes the area chaos, a taxi ride from anywhere else, you over look an interesting area!, expensive wi-fiConclusion: If you want a good value, clean hotel in Delhi, the Ginger hotel is a good option"
75,1623,"Dec 3 2008 	Value for Money	Surprisingly Rooms at Ginger Hotel was available for the dates that I was traveling to New Delhi. it was an hazel to reach the hotel, with all the construction work going on around it, and its location near the station gave jitters. All these was only till we reached to the hotel. The people at the reception were friendly and the room, pretty clean and tidy. Could not say it was big, but was sufficient for 2 persons. The only point of concern was the food at comesum restaurant housed inside, the food was just edible! though the live music at the restaurant was pretty good.Overall the hotel is complete value for money"
76,1623,"Nov 22 2008 	Excellent Value	This is the best value hotel I've ever been to. Its thoroughly modern, with all the basic facilities (including payed Wi-Fi at rooms). The location is good too, with Metro station right outside, and one metro stop away from Connaught Place (i.e., 5 minutes). Also, its easily booked online. The downsides - the shower area is a bit small, and the beds are very light (which can be a bad thing if you want them to stay put). Its also quite busy just outside, due to the railway station (Indian Railways, not the metro). There is no room service, though the affordable 24 hour restaurant Comesum is decent."
77,1623,Nov 10 2008 	best thing about the hotel is self service .. loved the ambience	i have recently gone through a very fantastic service in the hotel industry in india..the service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi..the system of help yourself is catching up fast in india and much to my delight the price of the hotel is fair enough to shell my wallet.
78,1623,Nov 8 2008 	Leisure at very low cost	I usually go on my bussiness trip to New Delhi. I prefer to stay in in Ginger Hotel. It has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have . Moreover easy to check In. Good Bed and superb guest service
79,1623,"Nov 4 2008 	Excellent Value for money	Excellent value for money.. Neat and clean. Within the New Delhi Station, hence a great choice for people travelling to or from there. There is a 24 hour medical shop and a vending machine for those late night hunger pangs. All of this for less than a thousand bucks !!"
80,1623,"Oct 30 2008 	Superb! Best choice at New Delhi Train Station	We have been there in Sept 2008.It is directly located at New Delhi Train Station.Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around 1000Rs. Reservation by internet or phone. TV, a/C, 24h warm water, clean linen."
81,1623,Oct 23 2008 	Excellent Deal..	No one could imagine such an excellent stay at the heart of New Delhi.I stayed for 4 Nights. The room was perfectly Clean. I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi againThe Price was the great attraction. It cost just 1000 rupees. But It gave the facilities &amp; comfort of 4000 Rs room. Superb.. Real Value for Money
82,1623,"Sep 15 2008 	More than Value for Money.	This is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger and Tata Group also owns the Taj 5* Hotels in India &amp; Abroad.An existing 7 Floors Rail Yatri Niwas which was managed by Indian Railways has been handed over to Ginger Hotels to run the Buget Hotels and it has been refurbished completely and opened in August 2008. With the Hotel Pricing at 1000-1200 for AC Room with LCD TV, Mini Regrigerator with small but neat and clean rooms you cant ask anything more. The biggest surprise was even a 4 Bedded Family Room also was priced at Rs. 1000 with Two AC's. They have WIFI Zone, Mini Gym, 24hrs Restaurant, Vending Machine and also a 24hr Pharmacy Center within the complex. I had seen around 15-20 International Tourists staying at this place. The Rooms are with Dark Shades with basic interiors and Hot &amp; Cold Water. No Room Service is provided and they manage with few staff and thats where they are able to cut down the costs. However compared to other Ginger Hotels this one is priced at much lower rate I guess it could be because of the agreement with Indian Railways because they have provided the Land &amp; Building."

I came to New Delhi to do a professional exam at Ramnath House Yousuf Sarai Community Center. All staff was very helpful and cooperative  especially the receptionist. I would like to thank Mr. Prithive (receptionist) for his help and advises. Many thanks. Hasan M. Abu NarrAbu Dhabi , UAE"
2,1625,"Aug 11 2009 	Excellent Staff. Very Courteous. Accommodative. Careless Owner.	I am very pleased with the staff. Staff is very courteous. The owner/management is lucky to have such a wonderful staff. It is not enough to have good staff. The owner/management should have good outlook and try to improve the condtions. Air Conditioning is not adequate, Staff maintains the rooms and bath rooms to their ability. But the owner/management should care to update the fixtures. Any bath tub or commode will go bad inspite of regular maintenance. It has to be replaced at one point. Similarly the Air Conditioning. If the owner/management can wake up and replace the old fixtures with new once at least oncer a year, this hotel can get more than 4 stars. But for now this is a 3 star or less.I give 200% credit to the staff. The restaurant is good. The staff in the restaurant is excellent. This hotel was arranged for us by GetsHolidays.Breakfast is included. We had to leave the hotel early morning by 6:00 AM to go to places twice during our stay. Since we went from US, we were only trusting the food at the hotel and were affraid to buy any thing on our way (in Dhaba etc). We requested the kitchen staff to pack some breakfast for us. They did an excellent job by packing toast, jam, muffin and fruit. I really appreciate the efforts taken by the staff to pack the breakfast in such a neat manner for us. Even though the hotel is away from the central Delhi, it is in a quite neighbourhood. Close to Delhi IIT and AIIMS.Since we were there in July the weather was un bearable. It was very hot and once we go out we sweat. Even though we travel in an air conditioned car, once you step out you sweat. We had vacate the room by noon. But requested the staff to allow us to take shower once we came back to pick up our luggage that we left in their cloak room. They were kind enough to allow us to take shower before we left for the Air Port.Overall this is a nice hotel and I would not hesitate to go back again. I would highly recommend the hotel to others."
3,1625,"Jun 6 2009 	Very Good	I stayed here for almost a week while attending a conference in the same hotel.Found the place quite good in terms of the rooms, amenities, facilities like the restaurant and conference setup. Large rooms and a great buffet in the restaurants were definite plus points.One negative factor is that the place was a little bit far from for example the city centre. Otherwise it was good."

5,1625,"Dec 29 2008 	Dirty and overpriced	We stayed at this hotel for one night, out 1st night in Delhi, it was a horrible experience.It is close to a main road, but not within walking distance to anywhere, very noisy all night!Bugs in the room.The breakfast was terrible and overpriced.We were booked at this hotel for another night after our tour and our last night in India, we did not stay here as we couldn't bring ourselves to enter this hotel again."
1,1627,"Expensive for what it is	I am not sure if it is worth to stay into this hotel. I think it is too expensive for what it is.PROSLocationCONSThey ripped us off with the taxi cost coming from the airport, use the prepaid taxi when you arrive at the airport.Not really cleanNoisyForget about the restaurant"
2,1627,"Whole area - Under construction	I don't know if it is the looming commonwealth games but the whole area around this hotel is 'under construction', which made getting to it (and even finding it) quite difficult, it also didn't feel very safe at night. Hotel staff were helpful, rooms were dodgy (run down and dusty) well overpriced, basically your paying for the city location."
3,1627,Sep 25 2009 	Economical no frills hotel right on Connaught Place.	It was a clean and economically priced hotel right on Connaught Place. Surprisingly quiet seeing as how we had a room next to the circle. Nothing fancy but great as a centrally located place as we came back through Delhi for one night on our way home.
4,1627,Aug 31 2009 	It's somewhere to get your head down...	Hotel 55 is an adequate hotel with a 70's styled interior which is quite in need of an update. It is centrally located in Connaught Place and thus convenient for exploring. Our double room was cool and for a pleasant change there was no requirement for AC of the fan on during the night. Bedding was musty but clean and the decor is average. Shower was hot and towels provided. Staff were friendly and helpful.This is not a luxurious hotel and should not be regarded as anything other than a convenient centrally located overpriced hostel. It is absolutely a 1* (at best) and guests should not expect something modern or luxurious.
5,1627,"Jul 25 2009 	Adequate and comfortable good service	Hotel 55 is an excellent option to stay when exploring Delhi.Rooms are clean, staff are friendly, good airport pick up.Be aware of unscrupulous travel agents that roam around and in the hotel."
6,1627,"Mar 1 2009 	Ticks most of the boxes for budget accommodation in Delhi	I have been staying at the &quot;55&quot; for nearly twenty years, on a fairly regular basis, and do not recognise some of the negative reviews which have been posted regarding it. No, it's not a luxury hotel (it doesn't claim to be), nor does it have a sumptuous dining room or gorgeous bathrooms. What it does have is friendly and unfailingly helpful management and staff, comfortable and clean rooms, and in the very heart of New Delhi (superbly located for the railway station by the way). The tariff is not bargain basement (but then what is cheap in Delhi nowadays?), but given its plus points I wouldn't stay anywhere else (although I would avoid the front rooms, which tend to be a little noisy!)"
7,1627,"Dec 7 2008 	one star only	Stayed about three nights; safety and courtesy was not an issue for us (we were an all female entourage); staff was nice and helpful; my emails were always promptly replied to. This is a one-star hotel, described as mid-range by Lonely Planet and in some other sources as a three star--but its not. Hotels in Delhi are expensive, which may explain the cost of this place. But for a thousand more rupees ($20), you can get nicer rooms that are a welcome respite from the craziness that travel in India can be. Rooms are small, bathrooms are purely functional but grotty and inconsistent, of our three rooms, only one shower actually worked; only one provided hot water. To be fair, we did not complain but only because we did not expect the problem to be solved within the time we had. There was no internet access from what I could see.For backpackers looking for a great deal, this is not it. For travelers who want just a touch more amenities or if you are staying more than a night, I'd look elsewhere."
8,1627,Oct 28 2008	hi ther im nshat from iraq	thes hotel it is Very good and Comfortable and Good service and The most important thing in Central City I stayed three days in it
9,1627,"Oct 22 2008 	Hotel 55 inexpensive and safe.	I had a nice stay at Hotel 55. Before one books here, they need to set their expectations. This is a one star hotel with 15 rooms. I stayed here for three weeks. I have never been waited on hand and foot like I was at Hotel 55. You have to take advantage of their hospitality. The breakfast menu was a bit limited, but the food was very good. I commonly would tell the manager I wanted some food not on the menu and it would appear about twenty minutes later. They will send someone to one of the local restaurants to get what ever you desired.The rooms and bathrooms are clean. They are simple and the fixtures are about 30 years old, but considering how horrid an Indian public bathroom can smell, there was nothing wrong with Hotel 55's bathrooms. They did not smell at all. They always had hot water. I would not recommend drinking the hotel's tap water, but they provide bottled mineral water.I never saw any bugs in my room, however on the terrace there were some small leafhoppers. These seem to be every where in Delhi. I really enjoyed the terrace, however I wish they had turned the lights off at night, so the leafhoppers were not as bad. The terrace is pretty, with potted plants and stucco walls. Its kind of amusing, the furniture on the terrace is plastic. My friends and I spent many nights enjoying that terrace.The staff was very trustworthy. That is important in a city that likes to hustle the tourists. I accidentally left my door open a few times and no one ever entered. The manager is Mohan, he was helpful arranging my travel to Jaipur and finding drivers for travel in Delhi. If you ask nicely, they might let you use their office computer for internet, otherwise, there is no wireless or ethernet.There are some things that I think were funny, but some would find a bit odd. Remember, this is India, if you are traveling here you should immerse yourself in their culture. There were two staff members who sometimes slept in the hall at night. They were very nice, gentle hearted men, and I was told that they were there to serve the clients who may be arriving very late at night. On busy nights, they did not have enough room to accommodate all of their staff members. I got used to it. If you need something, just tell them and it will be in your hand within 30 seconds. There are some rooms without windows, which seem to be quieter, the Delhi traffic is loud. I think the first floor is a bit quieter.You have to get used to having people do everything for you. You will never carry a bag, and the chi tea flows like water. I met many interesting European travelers here. Many females stayed at the hotel while I was here and they said they felt very safe.The hotel is in Connaught place. If it your first time to Delhi, you may want to avoid walking around Connaught at first, until you become more saavy at dealing with the people of the street. The hotel provided us with a car right as we walked out of the door, and took us to some nice peaceful places in Delhi."
10,1627,Sep 14 2008 	Worst hotel in Delhi!!!	This is probably the worst hotel that I've resided in New Delhi. I still remember opening the wardrobe and a flurry of mosquitoes burst out; It was horrifying. I requested the hotel staff to atleast spray some insect repellant but it fell on deaf years. The rooms were terrible and moldy. Avoid like the plague!
11,1627,"Apr 29 2008	Worst hotel ever	This hotel has GOT to be the most squalid and disgusting place i've ever seen (and i've stayed in some dives). Words cannot describe how repulsive this place really is. We stayed in Delhi for 2 nights and heard about hotel 55 from the lonely planet. The hotel website is incredibly misleading and claims to be 3 star, when I would question how it was ever classified as a 1 star. In line with other reviews, the driver never arrived at the airport although the manager was adament that he was still waiting for us once we had arrived at the hotel. They gave us a filthy, small and stinking room at the front of the hotel overlooking the road. After complaining about the noise, they moved us to the 2nd floor at the rear of the hotel. This room was also filthy and looked like a prison cell. The bathroom was full of mould, grime and limscale and the bedding was filthy. The hotel staff were lounging around drinking. Cutlery and soiled linen was strewn in the corridors and remained there the 2 nights we were there. The roof terrace (if you can call it that) is big enough for 3 plastic chairs, which were also covered in black grime and mould. Thankfully, the 1 full day we spent at the hotel was taken on a day trip to Agra. On our return (which we were dreading), the room had not even been touched since we left at 5am. I felt really unsafe, especially since there appeared to be only one entrance (the hotel is situated up 2 flights of stairs above a shop) and no fire exits. The manager was very quick to mention that the lonely planet had the star rating wrong ( they accurately classify it as a 1 star, whereas the website says its a 3 star). He told us he always recommends his website as the information in the lonely planet is wrong. Frankly, it ruined our experience of Delhi and I wish I had photos to add to my review to show how disgusting and squalid the place really is."
12,1627,"Mar 26 2008	okay	If you are expecting any kind of luxury you will be disappointed (hotel website in this case is perhaps a bit misleading), but if you want reasonably priced (in terms of its excellent location) basic accomodation than you can't go wrong. Staff were fairly helpful. All in all I was quite satisfied with what I got for my money. Could have paid less and stayed further out from the centre, but enjoyed waking up and having everything on my doorstep, seeing as it was a short stay. Though with the advent of the Metro this location advantage may become less pronounced as it takes 10-15 minutes to travel in from cheaper location."
13,1627,"Jan 8 2008	Wildly overpriced	After we were stood up at the airport by Hotel Blue (just as well they didn't turn up by the look of it from the outside) we had to wander round Connaught Place in the dark looking for a hotel. Hotel 55 was the cheapest we could find but 3000rp (about $80) for this dump was a complete rip off. We only stayed there because it was too late to be lugging our backpacks around. OK sized room, dirty bathroom, fantastically noisy both from outside and in. Anywhere else in India you'd pay about 500rp for this standard."
14,1627,"Oct 23 2007 	the absolute worst	If you enjoy staying in a windowless, grotty and filthy room smelling of gasoline, with the noise of about 10 indian guys yelling their head off until the early hours in front of your door (next to the reception), go on and book this hotel. And the guy at the reception works together with some other locals that hang around in the 'lobby' who try to scam you every way possible (they did the whole phoning-the-airline-to-reconfirm-a-flight-and-discovering-there-is-no-reservation charade, selling ridiculously expensive 'tours' that are crap, and every other scam they think you might fall for...). This is absolutely the worst place i have stayed in while in India!"
15,1627,"Apr 3 2007 	utter dump	our hearts sank when we walked into our bedroom. it was a complete dump with a rubbish bed and whilst technically it did have an ensuiteshower, i wouldn't have washed a dog in it. bearing in mind it was costing about 40 (~$80) a night it was atrocious. another aspect was that at night time there were permanently men sleeping in the corridor right outside our room - i don't know if they were meant to be security, but one was a really skinny old man with a big long beard, don't think he would have been much use in a fight - and you hear them talking when you used the toilet or even when you were lying in bedalso when we checked out the owner tried to charge me for 2 nights despite the fact i'd paid online for the first night. at the time i thought it was an innocent mistake but having read some of the other reviews i'm now wondering about that.would never go near this dump again and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
16,1627,"Mar 21 2007	hotel [--] [--]	Arrived late at night on train and didn't really have any other options at that time the room was already booked when we arrived we found that the room charge they had up on the board was 1,000 Rups more than the Indiatourism pamphlet indicated, got into room and it was terrible, small grotty and generally crap. Were quite concerned that we would have visitors with more than two legs during the night. Left first thing in morning, just couldn't be bothered arguing.Best advise stay as far away from here as you can, avoid it like the plague, try something around main bazaar much cheaper and alot nicer. Connaught place is not the location it is cracked up to be."
17,1627,"Nov 21 2006	Beware Hotel 55	I booked their driver to pick me up from airport and he didn't turn up. When I came to check out: they overcharged me for the room and I mistakenly paid without checking amount first. When I noticed, they admitted 'cheating' me out of money but refused to refund it. They said they would call the police if I didn't leave immediately without refund and would tell them that I had physically attacked the manager. All staff started nodding vigorously and I realised I was outnumbered and left having lost 2,500 rupees. On recounting this story to my tailor later that morning, he nodded and indicated that this was not the first time this had happened."
1,1629,"Jun 15 2009 	Service was atrocious; creepy place for women to stay	My friend and I stayed here as part of a Gecko's tour. Our room was cleaner than the Hotel Perfect (see my other review) but what really was astonishingly bad was the service. The staff were intent on a) getting tips from us and b) entering our room for various &quot;reasons&quot;. At one point one of the staff knocked on our door to tell us they had beer for sale (!). Each time we opened the door they tried to get into the room and I had to stand directly at the door to prevent this. When we arrived we offered the porter the standard tip for each bag that he carried to the room but he tried to tell us that it wasn't enough and even went so far as to take a 10 rupee note out of my hand without my permission! They scowled at any tip we offered for service and when we were in the cab just about to leave for the airport out of the blue they raised the cost of the taxi by 50 rupees! Stay in a nicer place, you deserve it!"
2,1629,"May 22 2009 	Best hotel in the area	Stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean and the staff was the best. They also had amazing food from room service. Quiet at night as well and close to the markets.Do check out punjab sweets as well. Good hotel, would recommend to anyone. The staff was exceptional. Oh and they also had Wi-Fi."
3,1629,"Jan 21 2009 	Basic but good value	We stayed here for 5 nights in total (spread over three separate visits). It was organized for us as a part of a car and driver trip. It is what I would call a basic 3 star hotel. The room was clean and well serviced. While it didnt have a window (looked onto an airshaft) it was quiet. Breakfast was included in our package, was served in the room and was OK. Could have upgraded it at an extra cost. Staff were friendly and helpful. The bed only had a bottom sheet and blanket but staff were happy to provide a top sheet.Location is OK. Relatively quiet street with markets at one end of street. A number of reasonable restaurants in the street and internet cafes nearby. Felt quite safe walking around in the evening. Is a 10 minute autorickshaw ride from Connaught Place. Autorickshaw drivers have trouble finding it so make sure you take a hotel business card with you."
4,1629,"Nov 27 2008	DISGUSTING DUMP	This was the worst hotel experience in my life and I have been to about 60 countries during my travelling time. There was supposed to be an airport pickup in the deal - that did not happen and neither did I get a refund on my taxi fare to the hotel. Breakfast was supposed to be included and that did not happen either. The room had NO windows, the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just a blanket - no top sheet. I was supposed to stay 2 nights but I took a taxi into town and got a flight out of India for the next day. I was charged double the fee back to the airport than the amount I paid for a taxi to the hotel as well and it was driven by someone connected to the hotel. This hotel was listed on an International Hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns about this place and note that they are no longer on that site and for the sake of other unfortunate travellers like myself I am glad at least for that."
5,1629,"Oct 28 2008 	A good middle range business/tourist hotel	This was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company. There was nothing wrong with this hotel, the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and honest, and the location was quiet at night.I left all of my valuables, which amounted to a few thousand dollars US, in the care of the front desk. I was a bit worried when they didn't give me any receipt but shoved it in a locked draw. No problems when I got it back as everything was still there.It was only about 50m away from the main shopping street and if you need a landmark then &quot;Punjabi Sweets&quot;, a very busy street side eatery, is in the same lane."
1,1631,Nov 17 2009 	Hazzle Free stay	Telephone booking is always confirmed whenever I have stayed here. Check-in is smooth. Sevice is good. Breakfast is always complimentary which is a plus.
2,1631,"Sep 14 2009 	Dont stay here cheap but definitely not cheerful.....	We chose this hotel after hours of searching on the internet and reading in books as there is so much choice in Delhi, and we definitely made the wrong choice in many ways. We were only in Delhi for the night as we were flying out to Kathmandu the following morning, and this hotel served its purpose but thats as far as it went.Good - The location is pretty good for the centre of Delhi but is way too far away from the airport - The bedroom was a good size and contained 1 double bed and 1 single, along with a table and TVBad - The hotel offered a free pick-up from the airport but we couldnt manage to get through to them to arrange one. They refused to pay for our taxi when we arrived, and also refused to take us back to the airport the following morning to compensate - The room was very dingy even for night time - The room was very dirty and there were flies and even a cockroach in the bathroom - The area immeiately around the hotel was not very nice and you wouldnt want to venture out the hotel at nightOverallIt may be very hard to rate a hotel when you have been there less than 12 hours but this place is simply awful. It may be cheap compared to a lot of choices in Delhi, but there's a reason for that. Pay a little more and get a better place."
3,1631,"Aug 5 2009 	Hotel ok but...	The hotel is ok as backpacker hotel. The staff is very nice and helpful. BUT be careful not to accept any extra service from this hotel. The hotel offered us to get a taxi for the airport and charged us RS 900 which is what you normally pay for renting the car for a whole day. A prepaid taxi will cost RS 250, Later we learned that the hotel had asked the driver to pay them the tip we had given him, and they told him that we had not payed for the trip in advance. That made us very angry and we shall never recommend this hotel to anyone."
4,1631,"May 21 2009 	QUICK SWITCH TO A FLEAPIT HOTEL	This hotel did not honour our booking through Hotels.com on 17  20 April 2009. We were travelling with two children, one 3.5 and the other 18 months. We arrived in Delhi at 2 am in the morning of 18 April (the booking was for the night of 17 April). We caught a Delhi Traffic Police controlled prepaid taxi from the airport to the address provided with the booking receipt. The taxi driver could not find the address and took us at 3:30 am to a tourist office/ travel agent. The travel agent rang the hotel and my husband spoke to the hotel reception, who claimed that the hotel was full, and that we should make our way to the sister hotel  Hotel Ivory Palace in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. At this hour of the morning and with two children, we had no choice. The Hotel Ivory Palace can best be described as a flea pit. We subsequently found out through a travel agent that the room that we were provided was worth $29 AUD or about 1000 INR. We had paid for a super deluxe room (their premium room) with separate bed and a cot for the children at $67.00 AUD a night (2345 INR). We were provided with a room that had: One bed for all four of us and when we complained an extra mattress was thrown on the floor Unclean bedding A hot water system that did not work and after repeated complaints it was fixed on the last day Strong kerosene odour for the entire duration of our stay No premium bedding and pillows No clock radio No coffee and tea making facilities No complimentary newspapers No housekeeping for all the days we were there No in-room safe No refrigerator No rollaway bedsThe Hotel Ivory Palace was not close to Connaught Place or the railway station, which the Hotel Balaji purports to be. This was the reason I had chosen to book it. We tried phoning the Hotel Balaji Deluxe in the following days, but we could not get through on the number provided on the booking sheet. After unsuccessful attempts to get through to the hotel, we decided that it was a short stay and we should devote our energy to seeing Delhi and getting organised for the next part of our holiday. There was obviously a connection between the two hotels as the Hotel Ivory Palace was happy to take our booking sheet as proof of payment. Our feeling is that if the Hotel Balaji could not accommodate us, they should be obliged to provide an equivalent or superior standard of accommodation, as opposed to the significantly inferior option we were given. The only recompense we received after several complaints was that our room service breakfasts were covered by the hotel (Approx 450 INR). We feel extremely ripped off by the experience. I was trusting that Hotels.com is a reputable booking service and maybe we should have paid more attention to the review DEN OF THIEVES  RUN FOR YOUR LIFE on Trip Advisor, as they document the sort of contempt that the Hotel Balaji has for guests booking and prepaying over the internet."
5,1631,Apr 18 2009 	Budget Hotel	This hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi.It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you.
6,1631,"Mar 28 2009 	It is worthy to go	Good place, only several minutes from New Delhi railway station. Marble floor, the staff is nice, asked me for water several times, but finally charge me 50Rs, it's OK. The room is clean, and the hotel price is reasonable cheap!"
7,1631,"Dec 30 2008 	Den of theives! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!	We booked a suite thru expedia, selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised. We arrived at midnight, no one was there. We called and eventually we were met by their employee who got us a cab. Certainally we could have walked thru the doors &amp; got a fixed cab ourselves. The driver got lost. Eventually we arrived, gave our itinerary # and we given a small room. We said ours was a suite (2 adults, 1 kid) the clerk waved expedia papers he possed in our faces and said that was our room. No problem, we would get is sussed out in the morning, I was too tired to argue. We showed our papers in the am, the manager said the clerk had bad eyesite. We we upgraded to a slightly larger room. I overlooked the construction, painting in the lobby the luke warm hot water, the roach, filthy blankets I dare not use, all to check out....where the clerk insisted on paying for the lift from the airport. (2x the amount we would have paid if we got the taxi ourselves) I said it was included, and I paid for a suite for 2 nites &amp; only got one, lets call it even. No, he said. Expedia charged us too little, we should not have gotten what we paid for.After 1/2 hour and 2 failed called to expedia (disconnected) I paid as not to miss my connection. So I paid twice the amount for a room and 2x the amount for the taxi. ....and had a lousey stay. Back in Delhi staying at a much much better hotel for hte same cost. Avoid the Balaji unless you want to get riped off deluxe."
1,1632,Aug 12 2009 	Hardly luxury but not that bad	We stayed at the Broadway on two separate occasions as part of a recent tour to India. We had two different rooms - one at the back looking towards the mosque and another on Asif Ali road side. This is a reasonably budget hotel located on the edge of Old Delhi. The rooms we stayed in were of an acceptable standard -not exactly luxurious but you get what you pay for. The air-con worked (which in July was essential). The bathroom was clean. We had a friend who stayed in a single room which did not have a window - which would have been a bit depressing. So watch out for that.I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is noisy. If you're at the back you get the call to prayer from 2 mosques. At the front there is the incessant beeping of Delhi traffic. The best thing about the hotel was the restaurant - which has won awards for kashmiri food recently. The bar upstairs was pretty grim though - no window and therefore smelled stale.
2,1632,"Jun 19 2009	good place	It was anice place to stay. You could enjoy a nice place to live as well as a nice location to wander about. So, i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends.We had a great time out there."
3,1632,"Jun 8 2009 	Veeeeeeery noisy...	I would never go back to sleep, I would go back for dinner, the restaurant is very nice, the staff is helpful, however the hotel is very old, and being wakep up by the mosque every morning at 6 am is not my cup of tea."
4,1632,Mar 11 2009 	quite surprising	It's not a particularly quiet hotel to be honest. We seemed to be lucky in that we got one of the rooms in the back with a view of the Mosque which was entertaining. It's a beautifully furnished hotel and has a certain old world charm to it.The service we received was quite good. We had to leave at 7:30 to continue onto Agra and the staff very kindly gave us some breakfast (we were a bit too early for the buffet breakfast).Thugs Bar is also quite fun :) We wanted to try the restaurant in the hotel as well but didn't get there (going by all accounts its meant to be fantastic!)
5,1632,"Sep 21 2008	Two weeks at the Broadway	I stayed at the Broadway for the last two weeks of July 2008 with a large group. My room was on the top floor, at the back overlooking the Jama Masjid. My sense is that the quality of the rooms varies a bit. The folks in front complained of traffic noise, particularly those on the lower floors. There are also rooms in the middle of the hotel that have no exterior windows, just opaque glass facing the corridor. You must get used to it, because no one seemed to complain about this. My room was lovely. It was very light, small but clean and bright. The bathroom had ample water pressure and hot water, though the shower usually took a minute to warm up. The air conditioning was quite powerful, maybe a touch too cold. It is true that the hallways have no AC vents, but enough cold air vents from the rooms to keep the halls relatively comfortable.The staff were prompt in providing room service, and kept the rooms clean over the two weeks. They did not pester us at all, but that may be because there was no point in pestering a group or because the hotel was full, so they were making money any way. Laundry was cheap, and returned same day, but be careful with delicate fabrics, as most drying in India is done by Iron (and sometimes the laundry did come back a bit damp). The mosque behind the hotel does call the neighborhood to prayer in the early morning, but I found this charming. Sometimes I woke up and listened drowsily before rolling over and going back to sleep, and sometimes I didn't wake up at all. On weekends all of the children of the neighborhood get out on the roof tops and fly kites. From our room we could literally see hundreds of them. Also on the weekends on the street in front of the hotel there is a used book fair. My sense is that if you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive and not in Paharganj, the Broadway is a good bet. The attached photos show our room. There are also pictures that earlier posters added of a room decorated by a French designer who stayed at the hotel. Fear not, almost all of the rooms in the hotel share our decor and not the loud multicolor decor of that room.As for food, we ate breakfast in Chor Bizarre every morning. The breakfast buffet was was more than adequate, though the restaurant was a bit dim for a morning meal. Every morning featured hard boiled eggs as well as either omlettes or fried eggs. Also at least one curry, cereal, toast, juice, tea or coffee, and on some days fried veggie cutlets or samosas. There was fruit juice and they will bring bananas on request. It is true that there was no other fresh fruit, but this is India. We were also fed lunch in a conference room, which gave us a sample of what the kitchen can do. Suffice it to say that lunch was generally excellent, and I'm sure that those eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner would agree. As for the bar, Thugs, yes, it is a bit of a dive. Who wants to go to India to drink?As for location, a tuktuk to CP or New Delhi station/paharganj cost 60 Rs. The Muslim neighborhoods behind the hotel are interesting to walk in, but better to go in a group. I saw no obvious dangers, but one of our more intrepid members did come down with a nasty virus.The Broadway is not the lap of luxury. But it is a solid mid range hotel in the heart of Delhi that exceeded my expectations and is definitely better than most of the reviews here would indicate."
6,1632,"Sep 9 2008 	Disgusted with Broadway hotel Delhi	I stayed here in a mixture of rooms for approx 4 nights - 2 nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty, noisy and old so upgraded to most expensive rooms at front which had been refurbished for far greater price only to find out that they too were noisy (as all rooms are adjoining with thin wooden internal door so you can hear everything from other rooms), no hot water for days, sheets covered in human hair. A complete arogance by staff and careless attitude of management when we complained. The bar is seedy as they come, food overpriced and general hotel over-rated. Were going to stay 2 weeks but left after 4 nights. I was sick of being harrassed daily by staff to buy a service from them either a taxi, a tour, a driver etc - even being told it was dangerous to go out alone, rubbish! Wouldnt return here ever, save your money and go elsewhere where they want your business and treat you like a guest rather than an inconvenience."
7,1632,"Aug 31 2008 	jack hammer broadway	I read all the reviews and tried to keep an open mind. I have stayed in some hell holes. So I was ready for anything. I was even ready for the bully attempt to make you buy expensive tour packages or when leaving finding added charges you did not make. So we arrived at the airport and please try to remember to go over to the front entrance of the airport ,thats where the taxi they send will pick you up. When we arrived in the lobby everything went smoothly I was so surprise. They took us up to our room where the hall was cluttered with carts I got worried until we entered the room. spacious beautiful bathroom. comfortable large bed.tv. loved it. overlooked the mosque enjoyed call to prayer. The only thing that was not so great was the work that was going on in the mornings the sounds of jack hammers. but after a while you tend to ignore it. the area is rather disappointing but cabs are plentiful. the resteraunt chor Bizarre was very busy and the food seemed more for tourist but there are really good vegetarian places only a few blocks away. I totally would go back ,really enjoyed my stay."
8,1632,"Jul 6 2008 	Hotel Broadway	We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Broadway. The room was OK (the view was nice, but the room was quite noisy), the breakfast was great and the staff were very friendly. We ate at the restaurant (Chor Bizarre) several times and really loved everything we ordered, in particular the gulab jamun."
9,1632,"Mar 5 2008 	Common areas look great ......	This hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra. It lived up to most of the reviews - an average sort of place. The common areas were quite clean and attractive, including the breakfast room. The room itself was fairly large, with twin beds, and nicely appointed. It looks like the furniture and fixtures were recevently updated, although the walls were stained. The bathroom shower sprayed a fine mist, but the vent vents into the hallway, so not only is your privacy compromised, but you'll also hear everyone / everything in the hallway. The room was not well insulated, so we could hear honking horns all day and all night as well as the barking and howling dogs. For those in need of English language television, there are about 80 cable stations of India and English language programming. The airconditioner worked, but the heater seemed a bit lacking, so ask for extra blankets if you're cold.The breakfast was pretty skimpy - toast, thin oatmeal, hardboiled eggs, bread, potatoes, artificial juice, tea and coffee. On the second day, fried eggs were also available, as well as cold cereals. The cleanliness was a bit suspect as we saw the staff wipe the used plates and cutlery and replace them on the table ...... using the same cloth that just wiped off the table ! However, perhaps because it was the start of our trip, this lack of cleanliness did not have an immediate effect on our digestive system (that would come later in the trip).We didn't get a chance to eat dinner there, although the guides and drivers remarked that the food was supposed to be quite good.The front desk staff was accommodating in making change for us and made us feel welcome."
10,1632,"Feb 16 2008 	Inexpensive and just OK	My son and I had dinner at the hotel's much praised restaurant, Chor Bizarre, in 2004. It was outstanding, a Mughal feast. For that reason I decided to stay at the Broadway on my solo October 2007 visit. I thought I might take all my meals at the Chor.The restaurant was a diappointment. Breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs -- scrambled one day, hard boiled the next -- and few other dishes. The entrees I ordered at lunch and dinner were good, not great.My single room had one window: it looked out onto a corridor. Actually, my two rooms. Without explanation the staff moved me after two nights -- to the room next door.My first room was designed to appeal to a six-year-old. Its curtains were decorated with cartoon characters, as was its bedspread and other items and parts of the room. Since the bed was a single, I wondered if many young children checked in alone.Aside from a bed, the room also had a chair and table (the latter attached to a wall), a small closet, a full-length mirror (decorated with cartoon characters), and a safe.The bathroom was quite modern -- and also very cramped.The Broadway's location is a bit distant from Connaught Circle -- about half-way between Connaught Circle and Old Delhi -- but since Delhi is so spread out, that's not really a disadvantage.A clear advantage is price: having paid between US$200 and US$300 on my previous trip, the Broadway's US$80 rate was quite welcome."
11,1632,"Feb 10 2008	Great location	I've just spent a couple of days at the Broadway. It's on Asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate and is ideally located for exploring Old Delhi,Jama Masjid and the Red Fort. All the drivers seem to know it so you'll have no trouble with directions.I had room 14 - a single room which was windowless. It was, however, clean and the bathroom was well equipped with regular clean towels. It's a bit basic, I suppose, and you couldn't call it luxurious but the downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike. Staff were likeable enough and more than happy to arrange pick-ups and suchlike.Would I stay there again? - mmmmm, dunno. At that price range I dare say it's fair value for Delhi but it was a wee bit characterless."
12,1632,"Feb 4 2008 	It smells bad!!!	We were 9 persons staying at this hotel for some days.I booked there because I had read about it in a Lonley Planet Guide, but we did not like it because:- The single room had no window!- Outside our room there was a mosque (very noisy very, very early in the morning!!)- The staff was not very friendly or helpfull.- Yes, the rooms had A/C but the corridor and the lift were hot!- But most of all: Everywhere there was a very bad smell....But when all this is said I have to add that the location was good. We walked in the small streets behind the hotel and it was near several places - we could go by rickshaw or Tuk-Tuk in a few minutes.I will not recommend this hotel - it must be easy to find a better one!"
13,1632,"Jan 17 2008 	value for money	this hotel was good value, not luxurious but good size room, good shower room, nice and clean, clean sheets and towels, attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice!"
14,1632,"Nov 27 2007 	Cheap but not again	I got a good price, and didn't have that high expectations. If I had been staying for longer I would have asked for another room. I got a a windowless room, which is the dirtiest hotel room I've ever received. With a cockroach, previous guests hair, dust, and so on. The bed was very hard. And the door had a huge gap under neath so all sounds in the corridor could be heard. There was also a call too prayer at sun rise. I slept very poorly the 2 nights in the hotel. But I've also heard from the other guests that there is a big difference in the rooms. So be sure to check what you get. That said they were very helpful. They organized breakfast before opening hours for me and a tour group. I was slightly worried about eating in the Chor Bizzare restaurant, given the cleaning level in my room. But it was excellent, with very nice staff, and good food. Try the saffron, semolina desert. This was in the hight of turist season with a Indian Pakistan cricket match, and a lot of fairs in Delhi so all the hotels where rather full."
15,1632,"Nov 24 2007 	Quirky clean and comfortable	When we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room 26. This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. Other than that it was pretty shabby. When we had slept and got up to go out of the hotel, the receptionist advised that our 'superior room' was now ready. We were shown to a very smart room, spotlessly clean (room 22) at the front. It felt like we were in a different hotel. It's worth checking to see what room you are in. The road outside however, at the front, was really noisy. Vehicles going all night. On balance it was a great place to stay. I can't comment on the value for money as it was part of an inclusive deal. The restaurant was good, always busy, you need to book yourself a table. Breakfast included a choice of hot food and the usual toast, cereal etc. The staff were a little stiff (in that slightly brusque Indian kind of way) but after a couple of days they were really friendly. Prices for the phone and room service were cheap, i'd expect to be paying over the top in Delhi."
16,1632,"Sep 30 2007 	Not a good experience	I booked this hotel after reading the one good review on tripadvisor and reading in various guidebooks that this hotel was a good value. I disagree. Although the hotel succeeded in providing us with a reliable pickup at the airport (we then used that driver for our tour of the Golden Triangle) for what we paid we did not get a good value. The hotel placed us in a room that was next door to a room that was being gutted. This meant we were woken up at 8:00 am every morning while we were on holiday by hammering, men talking, and sounds of drywall and plaster coming down three feet from us. After looking into the room next door, it was apparent that we were sleeping next to potentially unhygenic conditions, there was a pile of trash, drywall, plaster, and cement blocks in the room.Breakfast was less than desirable, the restaurant was dark and gloomy with a buffet that was questionably fresh. Suprising coming from such a highly rated restaurant, Chor Bizarre. Needless to say we did not eat dinner there. The area is convenient for sightseeing around Old Delhi but honestly it doesn't matter as you should hire a driver while in New Delhi to alleviate yourself from the frustration of traffic and getting ripped off by taxis and rickshaws.Overall we would not return to this hotel. The hotel room was clean, but given the conditions of the room next door (two feet from our beds) I would not pay US$100 for this room. It was worth perhaps US$30 at the most."
17,1632,"Apr 12 2007 	Great little hotel	Stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi, after reading good reports about it in the Lonely Planet guide. Its very close to the Red Fort, and Chandni Chowk ( a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life.) The rooms in the hotel are clean , with air-con, and very good bathrooms. Times of India delivered to your door every morning. The front desk changes money at a reasonable rate. The famous &quot;Chore Bizarre&quot; restaurant lives up to it's name, excellent food, wine and service!! There's even an antique car on which breakfast is served from! The &quot;Thugs&quot; bar serves just about anything you can think of. It wasn't the Ritz, but a very good value 3 star hotel. I paid about 20 for the room and a decent breakfast. All in all, a great little hotel."

I think the best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys, the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels. Location is not too bad either everything u need is reachable which a short walk its just round the cornor from a train station where u can catch trains too places all round india a good place too go from here thats not too far away is agra where u can see the Taj Mahal"
2,1633,"Jun 30 2009 	Hell on earth	The hotel is filthy, the staff are all dishonest. The Manager is even worse than the staff, I am used to travelling in India, but this hotel and any in its group are to be avoided.Room service tried to charge 200 INR for 2 bottles of coke (menu price less than 40 INR)Sandwich 600 rupee, menu price 65 rupee.We needed a room on our return to Delhi, the manager promised to upgrade us for the one night, the room in in the nearby Yuvraj was just has filthy (someone's period stains were on &quot;clean sheets&quot;) The upgraded room is listed as 1200 rupees on their website, the manager tried to charge 2800 rupees. there is not a hotel on that street that charges over 1500 rupees per night.Avoid this group like the plague."
3,1633,"Mar 1 2009 	Do Not Stay Here!	Do not let the reception fool you, we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there. The room was dirty and smelly. We got ripped off due to taking the services offered by the hotel and the one time we got food from the hotel we couldnt eat it as it wasnt cooked right! On a more positive note there was security in the hotel and once youve stayed here anywere else will seem lovely."
4,1633,"May 24 2008 	This so-called hotel is awful	I had to stay at Chand Palace in April 2008 for 5 days before I left India after a 3 month stay in New Delhi. You will see a lot of dirtness all over Delhi but you should expect that at a place where you pay that much money. The room itself - with a window which was too small to see the wall on the otherside of the &quot;street&quot; - was some how clean but the bathroom was a disaster. The basin was broken, the water was so strange that you couldn't use it for brushing your teeth - it's the only place I have seen where you can't even use the tube water for that purpose - the only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it, you will have just one winter blanket, which is useless for temperatures like 20 to 30 degrees during the night. Beside that, you should take some earplugs with you otherwise you are not able to sleep because of all that noise.The food was like the street food 20 Rps. which you can get everywhere in Delhi but here you will be at least 100 Rps. Furthermore, we you check in the hotel and ask for the price of the stay, then do that in a written form. I asked the desk manager before my check in and at the end it was nearly the double of the price. If you really want to enjoy that beautiful country and city than choose some of the other, less expensive and pleasent and really nice hotels - I mean one of the houses that is worth calling it a hotel - in New Delhi."
5,1633,"Feb 4 2008	Terrible in every aspect	We stayed there for 3 nights in January.It was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays...:-No daylight-VERY loud-Dirty -Very cold (no real windows).-Slum-like neighborhood-No hot water (we actually paid for hot water)-VERY unfriendly staff-Very expensive in comparisonAt the checkout they cheated with the account.So, just stay away from this [--] hole and look in Lonely Planetfor decent rooms...Regards,Christoph"

7,1633,"Jun 12 2007 	Terrible slum	Dark dingy room with leaking toilet, wierd unfriendly service, yellow dirty cold and smelling &quot;shower&quot;/pipe water. Stayed only one night thankfully, was worst night of 4month trip, even the hotel's own driver rips you off (400rps to conaught place via an unwelcome stop at his friend's restaurant!). Place accross the 'street' is a falling down firework factory...take care! If you are used to any sort of basic comfort then stay somewhere in southern New Delhi, not Paranganj! Positive reviews must be from hotel owner or staff, this place is not remotely acceptable even to a backpacker, certainly not at GBP20/night in India! We stayed in many other places in India, and hence I know how poor quality this places is compared to others around the country. Don't be fooled by the front desk, these places seems to spend their whole budget on the lobby alone!"

12,1633,"May 8 2006	One night no problems	I stayed for one night here and found it fine. Nice staff, good location, my ride to the airport came quickly and was resonably priced, the phone worked, as did everything else in the room. There were a few creepy crawlies in the bathroom but they didn't bother me! I would stay here again but next time I go to India I will be on a tighter budget and this will be a little over."
13,1633,"Apr 28 2006	RUN from this place!	Terrible location. Very dirty. Broken toilet, broken and filthy fridge, and broken air conditioner. Rooms smelled like dead fish. Don't even think of a good nights rest here."

There was no hot water, the room was dirty (but not crawling!), and many fittings were broken. There were a lot of (friendly)staff who never a seemed to do anything unless you actually gave them the bin to empty.It was just about OK for me, but I could not recommend it unless you are desperate to save your last dollar"
16,1633,"Oct 22 2005	dirty building site	This is not a nice hotel. It is basic but not at all clean. It is currently undergoing building work and together with hotel being built next door means there is constant drilling, welding and hammering from early am til late at night. The room was damp and the carpet crawling, literally. The food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but if you need some sleep, forget it. Also, room had no windows and broken AC unit."
17,1633,Jun 29 2005	Friendly Hotel	I stayed in Hotel Chand Palace 2 nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests and i will recommend this hotel to my friends.Gerard Luzi

2,1634,"Jul 29 2009 	Lovely hotel great service though not centrally located	I stayed here for 4 nights with my family. The rooms are big and clean. The service is absolutely fantastic. One morning we left very early to travel to Agra and the staff made sure there was breakfast available (even though the kitchen was meant to be open yet). We ordered room service one evening and the food was with us after 10 minutes and was delicious!The buffet breakfast was included. It was pretty good - selection of hot and cold dishes, Indian and Western. Also, they russle up a great masala omlette!I didn't use it but there is a decent looking outdoor swimming pool.On the down-side: not much of a business centre (1 computer and a fax/printer!) and not centrally located."
3,1634,"Apr 4 2009 	Pretty Good	Stayed here for the final 4 nights of my Delhi trip. The Modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the Metro link nearby is good. The rooms were very nice. No problem with the mentioned pigeons, room on 7th floor overlooking the park. The Cafe 24 restaurant was quite good and I found the breakfast very satisfactory. The Bar was quiet and nice for a quiet drink in the evening. There was not a lot to dislike bar the overpriced Internet Access which was also very unreliable. The area around the Hotel is not great with some very poor dwellings situated close by. Saying this there was no feeling of danger while walking the area."
4,1634,"Nov 13 2008 	Never Again	In the middle of nowhere. 45mins into delhi town, just feels like a lifetime with the taxi drivers.American breakfast!!!!!!! Have I got it wrong, do Americans now have curry and ommlette for breakfast.?As I was there on business I required internet access, this was unavailable for 2 days and when it was available I learnt that the whole of the hotel has only purchased around 9 hours for a 15 day period! I was aware that internet was chargable so was surprised to learn that the maximum logon was 43mins.Swimming pool was unavailable.Restaurants consist of 1 with 2 menus, food was not greatBar area was so dimly lit it was like sitting in a mine with no atmosphere.Staff not very helpfull.Expensive in comparison to many others in better positions.Left a day early, I would not recommend this hotel and if my PA was not my wife I would sack her"
5,1634,"Oct 31 2008 	Great Place To Stay	The place is lovely, the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive.The only other issue was the expensive internet connection"
6,1634,"Oct 9 2008 	Peaceful haven in Delhi!	City Park is a modern 7-storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi. To get the negative out the way first, it is a bit isolated, but it is easy to order a tuctuc or taxi. However, as the name suggests, there is a park opposite, so views from many rooms are quite relaxing, which counts for a lot in somewhere as manic as Delhi, and of course that also reduces the street noise. And it is easily accessible by the main routes in and around Delhi. This hotel is easily up to 4* European standards, close to 5*. Rooms are very large, the beds soft, the aircon quiet, the bathrooms well equipped and clean. Welcome cake, water and fruit a nice touch, particularly after a long flight or drive. The Chilli restaurant food was really very good, plentiful and reasonably priced at about 3-4 for a main dish, but the beer very pricey, 3/bottle, 50% more than most restaurant prices, and the service we received was a bit slow and staff seemed completely thrown because we changed the number of people on our reservation. There's a pool in summer, which is welcome. The extensive banquetting facilities also give an indication of the hotole's quality. Great for a stopover or a few days."
7,1634,"Jul 20 2008 	Poor Location But Clean	Clean rooms, seemed far from the city, decent breakfast and good gym (for India). Basic business hotel. We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks and each time the Internet was down which was pretty annoying."
8,1634,"May 1 2008	Sleepless night	We stayed for one night at this hotel on the first leg of the Golden Triangle tour, therefore this hotel was booked for us by our tour operator.Much to our disappointment, the hotel was a good 1.5 to 2 hours drive from the centre of Delhi. Some members of our Group had previously arranged to eat out in Delhi, but this would not have been possible. There was nothing much to do in the vicinity of the hotel.We ate in the hotel restaurant. The food was very nice, though terribly expensive even by London standards.The biggest problem we had was that of sleep (or lack of). After travelling for around 36 hours and with only a few hours sleep on the plane, we were hoping for a good night's sleep here.During the night, my wife and I thought someone was on the balcony trying to break in, until we discovered that around 10 to 15 pigeons were sitting on the balcony banging against the bedroom window.A bigger nuisance, however, was that a wedding was taking place at the hotel that night and at around 11pm they congregated in the car park below our balcony. They played drums and trumpets loudly until 2.30am. At midnight I called reception asking to change room, but my request was denied (only to find out in the morning that other guests had moved rooms during the night).The following morning we complained to the staff at reception who were totally disinterested in what I had to say. They offered to change our room.....even though we were in the process of checking out!Breakfast might have been good, but I was in such a grumpy mood that I couldn't possibly comment on it objectively! The butter was rock solid and was unspreadable- that's about as much as I remember.I would not stay there again."
9,1634,"Apr 29 2008 	pleasant hotel in dubious area	We stayed in this hotel twice, one night at the start of our tour, and then again just before we were due to fly out of Delhi. On our first visit we were put into rooms on a lower floor, and the pigeon problem others have mentioned wasn't too obvious. However on our final night we were roomed on the 7th floor and they were a thorough nuisance - flying into the windows, and constantly moving around during the night. The area around the hotel is not one that you would feel safe exploring, though lots of people seemed to be socialising quite happily in the park across the road. The hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing. We got a map from reception and realised that we were almost off the map of central Delhi. Like us, most of the guests seemed to be on tours and they only stay here briefly. A previous poster has mentioned dirty carpets - I think we must have stayed in the room after them as our carpets had obviously just been washed and were still a little damp. However - there are lots of pluses for this hotel. We found the staff pleasant and trying hard to be helpful. They did get overwhelmed at checkout time, as all guests are being picked up together. The staff in the bar were really nice, though we found the drinks pricey on Indian standards. The coffee shop downstairs was a pleasant place for breakfast, plenty of choice, though we didn't discover that eggs would be cooked to order on our first visit - just ask and the chef will appear. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel - as long as you are using it as a brief base you will find it quite adequate for you needs."
10,1634,"Apr 19 2008	Depressing setting	This was part of the Golden Triangle Trip (so Hotels booked for us)&amp; we had stayed at The Oberoi Maidens, Delhi for 3 nights at the beginning (which was excellent) so this Hotel was depressing, by comparison-even though the food was fine.There was nowhere to walk to -the Cinema &quot;complex&quot;next door was bleak &amp; semi derelict. There is a slum just next to it (with, we were told, Bangladesh refugees) with sludge/sewage/junk on the pavement - so it seems a bit spoilt of us to complain about the Hotel-neverthelessthe carpet in the bedroom was covered in stains. It also felt a bit malevolant outside-as men were being sleazy (to me-a female even tho walking with my husband in daylight) &amp; it was very noisy at night with shouting/car alarms &amp; pigeons/dogs (as others have said)..A highlight was an Extreme Sport chipmunk which sky-dived down from the roof of the Hotel Tower block &amp; swam across the swimming pool!"
11,1634,"Jan 22 2008	Rude Unfriendly Staff Bad Breakfast Annoying Pigeons on Balcony	The tour company (Hi-Tours) put us in this hotel for two nights. We had stayed at another budget hotel in Delhi on our own where we had a good experience (Silver Ferns). The City Park is totally remote, far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for a cookie store and an optical shop. We did not feel safe when we walked in the neighborhood. Our room overlooked a rubble filled parking lot behind the mall, and the balcony was full of loud pigeons cooing and pooping everywhere. Dogs barked tor hours in the night. The staff was rude and inefficient. I waited in line for 15 minutes to pay my bill on leaving because the person in front of me had questions about her bill. Six employees devoted all of their time to her and totally ignored me except to tell me to &quot;have a seat.&quot; The breakfast was tourist oriented and the service was slow. The room was adequate but I can't recommend this place for anyone."
12,1634,"Dec 28 2007 	Great for a brief stopover	This hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didn't have any choice in where we stayed, but we weren't disappointed. We arrived in the evening, having spent most of the day travelling up from Goa, and the day had been a bit fraught due to delayed flights and the possibility of missing our connection (which we didn't, thanks to tremendous efficiency by Kingfisher Airlines staff). The hotel was clean, comfortable and had the best bed out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our 2 week trip.Because we arrived quite late, we didn't bother to go out but just had a few drinks and a snack in the hotel bar. Food and drinks were okay.On the down side, there were pigeons on the railings outside our window and we were woken up at 4 am by what sounded like tap dancing - it was the pigeons being restless. The swimming pool looked nice although the water was a bit cloudy. Some people might also be put off by the fact that the pigeons were also sitting along the edge, having a bath in the water!Breakfast was good, although for a country known for its tea, I wasn't impressed - far too weak and wishy washy!The one problem we encountered was a small visitor in our room. I saw something scuttling along the floor and thought it was an insect. My husband saw it and realised it was a small mouse - on the 7th floor! The hotel staff were amazed when we reported this but hopefully, they dealt with it as soon as we checked out."
13,1634,"Dec 10 2007	Lovely Hoetl	We stayed at City park as part of a tour around india. I have no idea how much it costs but it terms of decor and space it was brilliant. The rooms were big with all modern ammenities. It is quite far from the very centre of delhi but you get taxi's everywhere anyway. The manager was very friendly and made sure we had a good time. Just be aware that everyone wants a tip, just say thank you and close the door. Nice hotel."
14,1634,"Dec 6 2007	Nice hotel to stay in and to get a great exp.	A 4 star hotel having all the 5star facilities and amenities at a great price,will love to stay here again on my next visit to delhi, staff was very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gud,and food was excellent specially yellow chilli......an indian restaurant......"
15,1634,"Jan 24 2007 	I recommend City Park	I was booked at the Jaypee Siddarth; however, despite having a confirmed reservation, I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel. I am glad. While it is not the most centrally located, the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional. I will definitely stay here again and the prices are reasonable - a rarety in India where hotel prices are unreal."
16,1634,"Jan 11 2007 	Lovely to look but beware.....	We found ourselves at the City Park for one night in between internal flights in India. Hotel space in Delhi is at a premium so we were glad to get a central(ish) room in a supposedly good four star hotel. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming, spacious and well laid out. The staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly. Our departure next morning was early and we had to be at the airport for around 6.00 a.m. so the car was coming to pick us up at 5.00.We had our young daughter with us and didn't want her to travel on an empty stomach so we made arrangements for a small breakfast before we left. We were assured it would be there. Their full breakfast, which we had paid for doesn't start till after 6.30. When we arrived downstairs the following morning the cafe was shut and the manager wanted to charge us for providing a sandwich from room service to take with us. All they would provide was a cup of tea or coffee and toast and bits of fruit There was no flight information which a lot of hotels (4 star and upwards have). In short no one cared.So I would say looks can be deceptive and if you don't want to be done - avoid this hotel. This is a 4 star hotel with 0 star customer care standards."
17,1634,"Oct 20 2006 	pleasant oasis in the suberbs	A little way out of the city centre and set amid tumble down houses and shops, this hotel is an adequate stop over. It has two restaraunts and a spa. (the aruvedic massages are cheaper then in Kerala with a one hour massage for 600 inr plus tax). The hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite which provides a pleasant area to walk without the hassle of New Delhi streets. Unfortunately open public urinals line the side of the street and the smell can be over powering on a hot day. Rooms are well appointed and the beds are comfortable."
18,1634,"Apr 13 2006	Great Hotel - Far Away	This is an excellent hotel. The front desk staff were very good, the food was good (breakfast was fair, but the dinners were excellent), and the room was clean. Laundry service was prompt and very good as well. It is just not in a very good location. It is very far from the main part of the city - it took me 1-1/2 hours from the airport, 1-1/2 hours to meet a friend at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, and 1-1/2 hours to the Baha'i Temple. I spent a lot of time in a car on the crazy roads of Delhi. There is wireless Internet access in the rooms, but its is very slow, and I had to sit near the door to get a signal."
19,1634,"Mar 18 2006	Too Far from the Main Delhi Attractions Expensive	If you are looking to do some sight seeing in Delhi, do not stay here, its in one end of Delhi (extreme North) far from the main attractions and you will get far better services and grandness with hotels in South/Central part of Delhi at lesser or comparable price. Its lobby and public areas are far smaller than most other 5 stars in Delhi and is located on a relatively smaller street in front. The distance of Delhi's main attractions like Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Bahai Temple, Old Fort is atleast 20Kms from here and you can end up spending a 1-2 hours to travel in peak hours (one way). The only place which is closeby (relatively only) is some of the Old Delhi attractions about 12-15Kms from this place but then its the same from the hotels in Central/South Delhi as well. There is absolutely no attraction around this hotel.This hotel also has mind boggling banquet business where marriages/family functions are organized making it a nuisance for the residents because of the noise and people which frequent in 100s all on a single day. It has atleast 3-4 banquets halls.This hotel is located in a North Delhi residential area while most of Delhi's other good hotels are located in posh south delhi localities."
20,1634,"Jan 3 2006	city park	we stayed here as the 1st night of our golden triangle tour. it wasthe best of the 3 hotels we stayed at - very clean, good rooms, and good service. the breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected.it was overall excellentand i will definitely sty here again on my next visit to delhi"
21,1634,"Dec 28 2005	A sound hotel with an excellent restaurant	We stayed in 5 hotels whilst in India and this was one of the best. It is very much a hotel catering for the business traveller, however, if you want to get into the centre of Delhi it will take around an hour due to the shear volume of traffic.The rooms are clean, are well decorated and a good size. The restaurant was excellent and probably one of the best we ate at in India!!There is also the usual facilities at the hotel, Gym, swimming pool, 24hr room service etc.A previous review of the hotel commented on &quot;tipping&quot; and staff holding out their cupped hands. We didnt experience this at this hotel, however, it is a very common trait in India.No real complaints about the hotel."
22,1634,"Oct 22 2005	Do not pay to sufffer - Never Again	We were on a World trip in April through to June 2006. We saw this Hotel rated as a 5 star and recommended by all major airlines. Whilst in the Hotel, we were advised NOT to drink the water, let water when showering enter your mouth, eat washed fruit or any salads. Strange for a 5 star which should have had water purification.All staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages, not tips. Other people we met in the Hotel had the same experience. All staff were underpaid yet room rates were from US$200 per night. One would bring 1 towel, get a tip and return with a helper and another towel and want more money for his return PLUS his mate. Then flowers, then soap, then more bottled water at US$4 per bottle. We met several others with the same experience and they paid more than us.Tthe owners ate in the restaurant and when they did, all staff left us and other guests and served he owners who did not care. I saw the owner's wife order six drinks in succession as she just changed her mind, sent the untouched drinks away and was so rude to the staff I could not but interupt and tell her off. She said we could leave the Hotel if we did not like it. How rude! as she was just so disgusting and I have not seen animalss treated the way she treated her staff.Everything organised from the Hotel was upwards of 5 times the price of anywhere else. they were renovating with jackhammers from 6am up to 10pm every night and regardless of complaints, ignored us and other guests who were lined up to complain.I felt sorry for the staff who tried so hard, but the management despised their guests, and their staff.I wrote to this Hotel and the Airlines who recommended it because I want to make sure others do not pay to suffer. Not even a reply.Never again!Marcus"
23,1634,Sep 28 2006 	Ottimo e bellissimo
1,1635,good value for money	i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai. First i was very hazy about where she is staying. after reaching there we have found that safe and nice pl;ace. in the main city off course nosiy like Delhi. Under one roof all the services available for the travelers. From Pick Up to Drop.I would recommend to every one
2,1635,"Nov 22 2009 	Adequate rooms friendly staff but beware of being ripped off!	The rooms in this hotel were adequate though super super deluxe far nicer and more spacious than lesser rooms. Not great value for money and very noisy due to construction work and the busy road outside. Staff on reception were nice and friendly, with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis and double charged us (service charge) for booking train tickets to Amritsar. We were also told that Delhi was closed on a Friday in order to sell us a trip out of Delhi, when in reality it wasn't! This gave us a bad impression of the hotel as a whole."
3,1635,"Nov 22 2009 	Don't stay at this hotel.	Rooms were ok, but everything else was terrible about this place. The staff changed their pricing on us many times (and of course, they over charged us). They don't have a restuarant although they say they do. Instead if you order something, they will just find it on the street and bring it to your room. Every person you see in the hotel expects a high tip for doing nothing. They say they have internet, but it is the computer they use at the front desk. Overall, this was the worst place I have stay at in India and the price was one of the highest."
4,1635,Nov 21 2009 	safe place	We booked 10 rooms for the marriage purpose for three nights stay. Hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement. This was very near to our house and the marriage location. all aur family members came form different parts enjoyed and cherish the stay over there.
5,1635,Nov 20 2009 	Average hotel but lots of hidden costs	We stayed at Clark Heights for 5 days in November. Original my boyfriend and I were given the wrong room - we had paod for a super deluxe but they put us in a delux - after arguing our case they graciously put us in a much better room. Some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for organising taxis with the hotel (including a car to Agra) and service charge on train tickets were high. Recommend to get Rickshaws than use their taxis. Overall a noisey but average hotel.
6,1635,"Nov 18 2009	Poor value for money	This hotel was nothing special. Firstly, it is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site. The rooms were basic. The reception staff were helpful, except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar - she ripped us off and then told us we were untrustworthy when we refused to pay charges that she hadn't told us about. This was after she had told us that the whole of Delhi would be closed on one of our days there, which we found out later wasn't true. There was always someone available to drive us places, though at an expensive cost. All in all, we weren't very impressed with this hotel and if you do stay here, don't book any trips without negotiating the price first."
7,1635,Nov 15 2009 	Seepage in the Room	Paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling. We do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers.
8,1635,Oct 29 2009 	No Limit for cheating.	I book room from internet. No pick up and no refund. 80 Kms. small taxi for 15 Rs. 1 km. cheating travelers coming for 1st time to india. High price hotel/ guest house.
9,1635,"Oct 28 2009 	Good value and nice location	We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel has a nice location - yes, there is noise from the streets - but nothing you couldn`t live with.Friendly staff an ok restaurant with cheap food."
10,1635,"Oct 23 2009	Love the hotel location	I was there in months of september with my father. I would like to share my views abouth clark heights. I personally feel this hotel is good for those people who visit first time in india bcoz here, I found very helpful and caring people and they helped me in my further tour as well and very well organized by the hotel staff. The rooms are very nice and specious I love to give **** star for this hotel. Only problem with our taxi driver that is he was to fast.I like this hotel bcoz of the location of the hotel in on the main road and they have there own parking facilities plus market is also very near to this place. Here, Reception staff is extremely helpful and well behave..."
11,1635,Oct 21 2009 	i m loving it	as i wnt to d hotel i was really impresd by the intrir.................the staff was really good and coperative..............i enjoyed hotel.........the food i had there was delisious.......
12,1635,"Oct 11 2009 	Noisy	The hotel was clean, room mid size.No pick up at the airport. Very noisy all night.Staff was nice location was ok; we prepaid 250 IR for a car taxi from airport"
13,1635,Oct 10 2009 	Truly home away from home.	The experience at clark was better than any five star hotel I v stayed in and I v stayed in many as I m a flight attendant . The rooms are way bigger n nicer than most. The staff was incredibly attentive and caring .(especially to my kids who did nt want step out of the hotel as they were so at home there.) The food was divine. and they took every care to cater to my kids' special 'out of menu' orders. All my out of town tours to Amritsar n Agra were very well arranged.The only thing I think They could improve upon is the toilet ameneties and external facade.
14,1635,"Oct 10 2009 	Constantly mislead me	I arrived in Nov in Delhi with my family. We booked hotel clarck online because it was easy. As expected we were picked up at the airport. The rooms were not as nice as the photos online, at all. We arrived late so had little choice. the y cheat us badly........."
15,1635,"Oct 6 2009 	Wrong Presentation	I booked this hotel on a friends recommendation and after looking the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is not clean 25 % of what it is displayed as. The staff is just eager to sell you tour to Agra and Jaipur. There ware small insects in the room, the bathroom has a foul smell. The hotel is on a busy road so we had no sleep the whole night. Charge is quit high compared to the services. We do not recommend it to any traveler from USA or Europe."
16,1635,"Sep 24 2009 	It's completely of the type i would prefer......	I enjoyed a great 2-days stay over there with my colleagues. The interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment 2 the hotel staff too because they managed it very well. The service is really upto the mark and moreover, what I liked the most is its location. I mean its too easy to get to other places from here which was our prime requirement during that trip. And, getting all this at so reasonable price is none less than a pleasant surprise. Infact, I am looking forward to more stays in CLARK HEIGHTS during my future trips to Delhi. I would definitely refer this hotels to all my friends....:))"
17,1635,"Sep 14 2009 	Excellent service pleasant and helpful staff Warm ambience	Hi ,I visted india in month of aug, with few freinds fro a wedding, Since we wanted to stay closer to central delhi and were on abudget , we chose this hotel.Good value for money.The staff was courteous , freindly and very helpful. The rooms were nicely done and clean. The late night coffe shop was a blessing for us due to late night at wedding function.The staff even helped us in getting few things that we had missed to carry along.,They even got our gifts packed in a very elegant way.I would recommend thsi hotel to all my friends from US. and would definately go back and stay ther.e everytime i visit Delhi."
18,1635,"Jul 31 2009 	Awesome simply Awesome	I had been to hotel Clark Height in the month of JUNE. I stayed their for 2 nights and 3 days. I must say its the best place have never been i mean the staff was excellent. specially ma fav place there the roof top restaurant such a pleasant place , 24hrs coffee shop, service were at the best and delicious food too. Rooms were quite clean and Comfortable and a king size bed to relax urself. Infrastructure is beautifully designed, internet facilities provided by the hotel was the best the speed was good and i can do my work without any interruption where else at other place i have to pay around 100 Rs. for the same really a helpful atmoshpere. In short will say its a Awesome place and next whenever i m gonna come Delhi my stay will be definetly der at Hotel Clark Height"
19,1635,Jun 21 2009 	Run Away	Many time you think for the best but you get nothing and you get bad experience yes I had a bad experience as the room given to me was very dirty and towel was smelling.I booked this hotel from internet as the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good. Big ManMushtaq
20,1635,"Jun 13 2009 	AWSOME HOTEL	I went to india last month for a business trip and stayed at Hotel Clark Heights.It was a wonderful experience.Room was immaculately clean, the bedding and pillows were heavenly , the bathroom and dressing area was very nice, and a separate space for an office desk and chair.. A lovely hotel. All staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant.Enjoyed my visit. I would definitely go back."
21,1635,"Apr 12 2009 	Excellent hospitality and food	We just returned from a 6 nights stay at Clark Heights hotel at New Delhi. Being from India, I am much familiar to the issues which some hotels in India have and I must say, both my wife and I were thoroughly pleased with the service and the room that this hotel provided us. It is in a crowded road, but accessible to the mero which is about a km away in walking. The best part of this hotel was that it was very clean and the bathrooms were sparkling and fresh. The double delux room is a bit small, but we found it quiet, as it was the corner room for us. The room service and special requests were immediately taken care of. The other thing which we thoroughly enjoyed here was the food. Since we had a six year old son with us who we have not trained to eat spicy food, we asked the cook(chef) to make sure that there is no spice. That was always complied with. The menu is mostly North Indian food with some Chinese and Continental options also. They even packed sandwiches for us in the early hours(4am) of the morning when we were to go to Agra. The food was so tasty, that at times while sight-seeing in Delhi, we used to head back for lunch to the hotel just to have the food. (There is a famous four-start hotel in Connaught place whose restaurant refused to make food with no spice, so we had to walk out). The basement retsaurant is used for lunch and the roof is now made into a roof-top restaurant and the open-air was very pleasant. We can see the metro line and the moving trains from the roof-restaurant, something my son enjoyed. My only wishlist is that the hotel must tie up with a more reliable cab-service, we had some concerns with the car on one of the days(got an inexperienced driver once - a bit dangerous for Delhi traffic, so we stopped the car after couple of minutes and got another reliable driver whom we stuck to), but otherwise pickups from airport and drops went on plan. Overall, a good experience and if we visit Delhi again, for this price, it is a good stay."
22,1635,"Feb 24 2009 	Decent Hotel Great Staff	This is decent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar, but it is on a very busy intersection, so be carefull to while booking room. Do not book room by metra side, or you will not be able to sleep. Hotel staff was very good. I had an issue with my rental car and I had to call 1000 KM away and my cell phone gave up because it was changing network. Receptioninst lady gave me her own cell phone to use as it was early in the morning. Accept one minor incident of overcharging by room service(This was corrected by front desk right away and they apologized so I will believe it was just a mistake.). Rooms are clean, bathroom is great with international standard and property is very clean."
23,1635,Jan 20 2009 	cleancomfortable and friendly.	First time in India and after a poor night in Mumbai I was pleasantly surprised by the Clark Heights hotel. Convenient to the Delhi Metro I found no difficulty getting around.The hotel room was clean and well appointed with a flat panel TV.
1,1636,"Nov 26 2009 	just a small lodge not a 3 star hotel	The rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered mostof the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowingtoilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; thehotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentifieddripping in each room during the whole night); and the breakfastcutlery was not clean."
2,1636,"Nov 23 2009 	In Delhi you often get less than what you pay for and at this hotel .... much less	I had a 26 hour layover in Delhi, ugh, and I wanted a hotel that was clean, with Wi/Fi where I could crash for the night. This hotel has wi/fi but it is not what the photos portray. The photos that the hotel uses for promotion totally fail to capture what you get at this hotel. Go to Tripadvisor for photos of those who actually stayed here. This hotel is very old and run down. In the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb. There are stains on the sheets which show that cleanliness is not part of this manager's mentality. The fuzzy TV works but the remote doesn't .... I hope you are getting the picture. The words that come to mind are: grimy, tacky and overpriced for what you get. Finally, outside, where the hotel is located, is blighted, noisy and remote.  Conclusion... there has to be better property's for just a night than this."
3,1636,"Nov 21 2009 	Really enjoyed	i been to this hotel in this month only, and find it worth it for money, check-in take just 3-4min to get our rooms, housekeeping manager is really helpful, all the staff members are really nice n helping . even there travel desk is very helpful for us.Awesome nad enjoyable trip!!!! gr8t memories"
4,1636,"Nov 21 2009 	Average	The hotel is located in a very busy, noisy and rowdy area. For those who love shopping, it is ideal. However, the staff are curteous and always at one's service. The rooms are neat, the food is satisfactory. The Tour company Abyss Tours lived up to expectation. On my next trip, God willing, even if i don't stay in the hotel, i will still employ the services of Abyss Tours."
5,1636,"Nov 21 2009 	Very Clean Comfortable and Firendly	The hotel is well positioned, the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us.Rafiq Khan who operates through the hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged for us to have a driver for the say to enable us to see all the sights in the safe knowledge of having a car waiting for us.Lovely friendly people and I owuld recommend both the hotel and people higlhly to all."
6,1636,Nov 19 2009 	not recommended	The air con make so much noise that you cant even get a nap for 5minutes not recommended. Room is ok but all fixtures are old.
7,1636,Nov 16 2009 	DO NOT COME HERE OVERPRICED FOR ITS QUALITY	A normal hotel which is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight. They took $70 from me which is overpriced for the service andthe kind of room which was given to me. Why I am saying this becausewhen I went to a nearby hotel(this area is full of hotels). I got amuch better quality and service at 40$ had they given me good andclean towel (they took 30 minutes give me dirty towels) probably Iwould have not checked out and came to know the difference.
8,1636,"Nov 12 2009 	Excellent budget hotel in Delhi	The hotel arranged to meet &amp; collect us from New Delhi Railway station at 6.30am, and we were transferred efficiently to the hotel. Check in was friendly &amp; efficient &amp; we got a free upgrade. The room was spacious enough, everything worked fine &amp; the included breakfast was very good. I would highly recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi."
9,1636,"Nov 10 2009 	Not Worth It	This hotel is in a very busy are. There are many hotels nearly. Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good. We checked out ofthe hotel next morning and the reception took 30 minutes to check usout. The bill was not ready and excuse was that there is someconfusion. If I had a flight to catch, I would have missed it."
10,1636,"Nov 9 2009 	Open lobby...	This hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator (who walks about the hotel giving the impression he is a hotel employee) who attempts to sell you a golden triangle tour for a very high price. Of greater concern is the fact this man somehow manged to find what room we where in, and infact made an internal telephone call to our room to attempt to arrange to meet us to sell his tour services. I wonder if the hotel is taking a commission for this? He was present in the hotel lobby bothering the tourists on all 3 days we where there. His office is around the corner from the hotel, and he will attempt to take you there to do a hard sell. Despite this negative first impression, the food was great as was its price, service could be better. Hotel pick up was relaible. Front of house staff attentive, but aloof at times. Air conditioning was not working in our room and it took over 2 hrs to relocate us. The drains are very smelly and the room had a musty smell to it . Generally clean and well presented. No window in either room so no natural light."
11,1636,"Nov 9 2009 	Decent Hotel Good Location	This hotel was just fine. Its a little pricey but then so are all hotels in Delhi. We arrived having booked in advance and check in was very smooth. In the first room given the toilet leaked so we asked to move. This was not a problem as other rooms were available. The second room was just fine. Rooms are on the dark side but they are clean and comfortable with satelite TV, Air Con and a Fan. Also we had a fridge which is always nice in such hot tempretures. Hot water only worked in the morning. I like the neighborhood of Karol Bagh. Its in a local Indian Market for Sarees mostly so its interesting to walk around and you dont get hassled too much (comparatively). I always felt safe here. The metro is a 10 minute walk if you want to get around independantly. Also there is always a AutoRickshaw Driver to hand to haggle with. You are close enough to all the attractions by these transports. I would recommend this hotel."
12,1636,"Nov 3 2009 	A lotus in a market and traffic pond	As i am aregular visiter to delhi due to metro project, this time i made the booking through web and finaly landed to clark which is located in a busy street, But was realy surperised once we enter, it was really cutting you from outer busy environment to clean atmosphere where you can easily relax in clean rooms, staff was realy helpful, free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really a big advantage, will visit again in november, thanks to there hospitality."
13,1636,"Oct 30 2009 	liasoning with wrong people	Me my wife stayed here for a good 3 days good. Rooms were not that bad but not that good too. Breakfast was average. High price for hotel like this, they have arrangement with bad travel agents and they took almost more than double price for a tour to agra, jaipur. We know from our friends who did same tour in quiet fewer prices, car and hotel were same. Rippled off."
14,1636,"Oct 19 2009 	More than you Expect	Our travel agent booked this hotel for 1 night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book 1 more night directly at the front desk who were very polite,gentle and helpfull always...Next day mor ning after our breakfast we were planning to get around the city but had no idea what to do in an unfamilliar place at the same time Mr.Chokerborthy introduced us with a man in the lobby named Mr.Zargar who arranged some part of our trip around Rajasthan for 10 days &amp; got to see alot more in such a short time.The service is ok &amp; most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes.Breakfast in the morning could be better with some other choices but no complaint at all we got what we asked for.I recommend this hotel for any travler bcoz they do care for others no matter how old you are."
15,1636,Oct 12 2009 	Friendly clean and safe	Airport pick was very helpful. Little expansive but Delhi's hotels are expansive compare to other cities. Use travel sites to get good deal.
16,1636,"Sep 24 2009 	Excellent Oasis in the heart of the New Delhi'	We had previously experienced a great rooftop meal here- and decided that we would stay here on this trip to Delhi. We weren't disappointed! We got a very good deal/rate through Expedia to spend a week at this great hotel. The rooms were small but well presented and exceptionally clean- complete with comfortable bed, wifi and complimentary toiletries. The rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts (recommended the on-demand omelettes and coffee) and no fuss late evening meals/refreshments were delicious.All staff were attentive and helpful- any small niggles were dealt with efficiently with a smile.The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Karol Bagh district of New Delhi- a fantastic place to get a feel for real street life. With a large local market at the end of the street and the superb Suruchis (thali) restaurant only two streets way we were never stuck for places to discover by foot.Highly recommended. We will be back."
17,1636,"Sep 23 2009 	Wonderful Stay	I booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay, which included an airport pickup. First i was bit worried about the airport pickup but was glad to see a car to pick me up at the airport, however had to pay the driver extra to turn on the AC. The room was clean (though small in size) including the linen. The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater. Will definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay.And yes the bed is amazing!"
18,1636,"Sep 10 2009 	good and clean	i stay 3 nights and person of the hotel was very nice , and the rooms are very clean , food good too... The travel desk of the hotel very helpful &amp; friendly Mr. Rafiq &amp; Mr. Haroon."
19,1636,Aug 29 2009 	Really helpful staff and central location	The staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to. The room while not large was still well kept. I was also pleasantly surprised by the open rooftop breakfast area/restaurant. I got to Delhi by myself and the hotel provided a free pickup at the airport and I felt pretty comfortable in and around the area as a single female traveller and was only later joined by my friend.
20,1636,"Aug 27 2009 	The smells noise and heat of Delhi with the bliss and escapism of the hotel.	Fab hotel - possibly a bit pricier than some in Delhi - 30 a night, but a lap of luxury when off the plane, and trying to find your feet. Very comfortable, great food, but mostly, excellent service and friendly!"
21,1636,"Aug 27 2009 	Nice Hotel; Grotty area	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in August 2009 and were pretty pleased overall. The hotel is lovely inside, the room was spacious, the A/C worked, the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were more than helpful. The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India.The only thing that lets the hotel down is its location. Karol Bagh isn't a clean, Westernised area like the areas that house some of the 5 star hotels; it's dirty and congested and there's a good chance of stepping in something unpleasant as you leave the hotel.The nearest Metro station is only 5 minutes walk away though and it's only a couple of stops to Connaught Place"
22,1636,"Aug 14 2009 	Great value hotel lovely rooms - peace in the mayhem of Delhi!	This is great little hotel which has great value. Breakfast is included in the price and is very good. We had food in the restaurant one evening and despite being the only ones there, the food was very good! The rooms were really comfortable and clean.We booked to stay there again at the very end of our trip and we got the most gorgeous room with a bath and fabulous shower. Loved this hotel - location is not the best but would definitely stay here again."
23,1636,"Jul 23 2009 	Top value in a good location	We are sat in the foyer as I write this review. We are only staying for two nights and booked on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. It represents excellent value at around 20 pounds per night. The room isn't quite as spacious as the photos suggest and are well used. The room is clean and the aircon works (a must in Delhi in July). If you are used to 3 star European hotels you may be a little disappointed with the first impression, but things are different in India!The staff are numerous and very helpful. The restaurant is very good. As the previous reviewer points out, the breakfast is a little strange but they make a good omelette. For dinner we had an excellent mixed tandoori for two, which with lashings of (very strong) beer came to around 6 pounds each. The best curry sauce I've ever had!The district is lively, with miles of streets with small shops and street vendors. It's noisy all day as all drivers seem to beep constantly. Be prepared to have to haggle for just about everything! It's assumed (I think) that tourists are very wealthy and will pay anything!In summary - this hotel provides an excellent base for exploring Delhi."
24,1636,"Jul 22 2009 	Would recommend for the price	Stayed at the hotel with wife and 3 year old and got a king size bed as asked for. Room was a decent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary. Had breakfast at the hotel and the choice was a bit of a let down, had spicy noodles and pasta amongst eggs and toast! But for the price we paid you couldnt complain. The area around the hotel is very noisy and if your a light sleeper like me then that will be a problem, my wife though was fine. The upside of this is that there is a good market at night in the area for some shopping. For food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the area as when we asked for directions he said its 5 miles away and a 100 ruppee ride. We happily declined. In short you could pay a lot more in Delhi for not much more."
25,1636,"Jun 27 2009 	not great but good	We booked our stay at Hotel Clark International before we left home which turned out to be smart because we met other guests who said that they booked by going to the hotel once in Delhi and they were charged double what we paid. Overall, my b-f and I had a good stay here. We got free pick-up from the airport and the hotel was in a good location, but the drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the a.m., they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didn't drink, and phone calls were pricey. One of the major pitfalls against this place was that the staff wasn't all that helpful. When we asked if they had a map of the area we could have, we were told to follow a man in the lobby who would get us one. We were then taken to a travel agency who tried to talk us into booking tours to Agra and sight seeing around Delhi. They also charged way more for a lift to the airport than a taxi actually cost. Our room was spacious and clean (although the washroom was a little dingy and the TV was broken). The bed was comfortable and the AC worked. The breakfast that was included was ok."
26,1636,"May 12 2009 	Excellent Choice	We were a bit concerned over the mixed reviews, especially of those who booked their rooms via Expedia and subsequent problems they encountered. The Expedia rate is almost 1/2 the price of the published rack rates, so it was hard to resist!We booked (and prepaid) via Expedia a premium room. Our international flight was due to arrive at 12:30AM but was over an hour late. I had reconfirmed our flight arrival details with the hotel along with our room reservations about a week before we were due to arrived.We were very pleased (and grateful!) that the hotel &quot;boy&quot; was smiling and waiting for us at the airport and whisked us away to the hotel. Check-in was a snap, with only a quick stop at the front desk so they could photocopy our passport info then off to the room.We could not be have been more pleasantly surprised. The bed was awesomely comfortable, the room, (on the 3rd floor) was clean, neat and modern. Plenty of hot water. The tiny window provided no view, but hey, who comes to Delhi for the view?Breakfast was included in the rate) and was satisfactory. We also ate dinner there the first night and it was very good. Watch out for the high alcholic content of the Kingfisher beer however! It is a real kick in the pants:) It's not in the polished area in Delhi, but an interesting neighborhood with a colorful market. It's only a couple blocks from the metro. The autorickshaw drivers in the area were a bit annoying but that's Delhi.You will need earplugs. I think earplugs were invented specifically for India. Between the barking dogs and honking of horns, it's a wonder anyone gets any sleep!If you look for an good value hotel in Delhi, and don't want to spend over $100.00 a night, this is an excellent choice. The staff was polite and helpful, but not effusive. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return here."
27,1636,"May 9 2009 	Value for money	I booked the Hotel for a stopover before my international flight. I was coming from Goa and got the Hotel details here in this site. After deciding to go for it , I got a reservation through hotels.co.in for a Premium Room+Airport Pickup+Internet for US$36. That was pretty good I think . I although my flight from Goa was delay the boy from the Hotel was there waiting me and took me safely to the city. The place is busy, but the hotel seemed nice at first. After I checked in, the boy took me to my room and as soon as he opened the door I noticed it was a standard room. Immediatly upon calling the reception and explaining that my booking was for a premium room the moved me. The room was nice and clean, but the bathroom although clean was a bit run down. The food at the restaurant was ok and the breakfast, although simple, was ok too. They charged me INR$600 to take me to the airport the next day.Anyway, it was all right ... and the price was ok, so I think I can recommend the Hotel."
28,1636,May 7 2009 	Centrally located	Gud option if you are travelling on a tight budget
29,1636,"May 6 2009 	A welcome sight after travelling!	We booked our stay her for the first few nights in Delhi and then wandered around looking at some of the other hotels in the loney planet but nothing was a patch on this one so we ended up returning two more times! The staff were always welcoming and there was a real sense of safety. We booked through Expedia and then directly through the hotel for the other two stays. Expedia was half the price of the published price but the hotel happily gave us the same rate for our other stays. The rooms were clean with LCD TV and really comfortably pillows! (The rooms on the 3rd floow seemed a little more modern than those on the 2nd) There were no windows in the cheaper rooms. Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant and is included in the price. The hotel is situated in a busy shopping area with coffee shops, Pizza Hut and McDonalds nearby (just in case u get a case of Delhi Belly as we did!) There are also loads of other local choices. When booking travel use the agent across the road from the hotel, he really looked after us and was nearly half the price of the guy hanging around the hotel lobby! There's an internet cafe nearby so everything you need! Easy to catch a rickshaw a travel around. Would definitely recommend!"
30,1636,"Apr 21 2009 	So-So	I had a few occasions to stay at the hotel once in sept 2008 and once more in nov 2008. There are a few things that i liked about the hotel and few that probably, in my opinion was a little bit of a let down. The things i really liked : room ambience, room cleanliness, hospitable staff, top floor open air restaurant, proximity to market place and metro station, food(taste). the let downs: room service - sometimes took ages, food was little spicy,lack of variety in food choices, AC- almost non functional, room size, tv(still CRT) in some rooms. I noticed the lack of variety in food since i was staying for a longer period of time being on a business trip..for ppl staying overnight or just for a day or two, it might not be bad at all. I could see lot of foreign tourists stayin there...If someone is looking for a decent acco in karolbagh area , would recommend to try this one."
31,1636,"Apr 3 2009 	Great modern and low cost with exceptional service	My sister and I staye dat this hotel for a business purpose. The staff were amazingly friendly and very personable. They assisted us in all aspects of our business helping us with leads, the hotel stay and anything we needed. We were two single women in Delih so they were very helpful and assisted us in travel.In addition they have free WiFi and a conference room where we were abl eto use it all day for interviewing stayy. They never questioned the time in the conf room and were very helpful.the rooms were clean, very modern, on the small side, but perfect. Being british travellers, we are always cautious in travelling to India and yet this was a good cost hotel with great cleanliness and quality.The restaurant has a great breakfast incl, but closes early at night. Theed in a great spot right close to the Coroba market. We had also forgot one of our suitecases at the hotel and they immediately sent a driver with it to the airport - we did not have to worry about loss or theft! A hard find in India!"
32,1636,"Apr 3 2009 	A Home away from Home-Will Stay Again.	During my recent trip to India, I &amp; my husband stayed at Hotel Clark International at the at the beginning, middle and end of our trip at New Delhi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel especially because of the very friendly, accomodating &amp; warm behaviour of the Hotel Staff. I had choosen this Hotel based on all the online reviews, good, bad &amp; ugly, and had decided to find out more on my own, and I can say I am very happy that I selected this Hotel. I was especially happy because of the in -room Safe, the mini bar &amp; the Complimentry Tea/Coffee, Breakfast, &amp; airport pick ups &amp; drop of. The Room &amp; the Bath were very good and modern The Hotel restaurant on the fifth floor - roof top is excellent. The food is particularly good.I was specially surprized &amp; touched to find out that on my Birthday, the cake which my husband ordered was delivered complimentry from the Hotel &amp; the food that the restaurant catered was loved, appreciated &amp; savored very much by my gathered friends &amp; family. I should also mention that -there is also a Travel service available at the Hotel Lobby, &amp; also help with Money Changers.I extend my thanks to Mr. Rajesh Patyal, &amp; Mr. Chakraverty at the front desk, Mr. Thakur, &amp; Mr. Ram Singh, Mr. Prem, and the rest of the staff for taking such good care of us. I also like to mention Mr. Haroon of the Travel Agency &amp; his associate Mr. Rafiq Khanwho have been very helpful in setting up our comfortable site seeing trip from Delhi to Puri and back. I and my Husband really enjoyed our stay in this Hotel. I and my husband are going to be the guest again at Hotel Clark International for sure and I whole heartedly recommend to anybody &amp; everybody who wants to stay at Budget Hotel with all the aminities of a Pricy Hotel surrounded by friendly Staff to come and stay here, they will not regret it. I particularly loved it ...It was my home away from home during this visit, looking forth to coming soon...Mrs. Bhattacharyyaapr1_63@hotmail.comNew York"
33,1636,"Feb 27 2009	Good location ok hotel	My wife and I spent three nights im the Clark International in February 2009. The hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at 6.15 AM, but claimed that the hotel boy had been there and that we just hadent spotted him. Might well be, but our theory is that he was there to late as we were out of the airport allready 20 minutes after the plane arrived.No problems though with a pre-paid taxi from the airport to the hotel, were we arrived arround 7:30. The reception fixed a room to us and we could sleep for a couple of hours before starting off for the city. The room was on the 3rd floor and held a lower standard than what we had expected. Later in the day - after complaining - we got another room (on the 2nd floor) which was more spacy and modern. Both rooms were clean and free of any kind of bugs.The Clark International is located in the Karol Bagh area which is quite convinient as it is close to the new and rather impressing metro. The metro will be increasingly important in Delhi. Karol Bagh also hosts a street market which is quite charming. The market starts just a block or two away from the hotel entrance.Karol Bagh is a busy area with a lot of small shops, some hotels and the streets are crammed with cars, rickshaws, cows and street vendors. Quite as it should be in a Delhi neighbourhood. The hotel was definately the most expensive we stayed in during our 16-day India tour. Delhi has a lot of very expensive 5 star hotels, and its not easy to find good options in the 3 star segment. Clark International turned out to be a good one. The only negative thing we can come up with is that there is some noise from the streets and the surroundings. (This by the way occurs to all the hotels we stayed in in India). When we were there demolition works were going on in a building near by and that created a lot of noise starting quite early in the morning."
34,1636,"Feb 17 2009 	Put us into a	I booked the Hotel Clark International directly via their website.. The hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation. When we arrived in Delhi from the airport at 1:30 am we were told the hotel did not have a room for us, the hotel was fully booked. They never mentioned this to us when we called from the airport for our transfer.They said they would put us up into a &quot;sister &quot;hotel down the road. The Hotel Surya was awful... We were so tired from the flight and it was in the middle of the night we just slept in the room in our sleep sacks.Thankfully I had the insight to buy them. The next morning as we were flying to Varanasi my wrist started itching and I noticed I had small red marks, bed bug bites. I booked the Hotel Clark International so our first night of our 21 day trip to India would have a smooth start. it was anything but that..I was charged the same quoted rate even though we stayed in an inferior hotel, something I would never had booked. I could not recommend them due to this poor customer service. I felt I had been ripped off with their bait and switch.."
35,1636,"Jan 25 2009 	Satisfactory Hotel if a little over priced	We spent 5 nights in total over 2 different periods at the hotel. We stayed in an Executive room though we were upgraded free of charge to a Premium room for one night.We paid 86 per night for the Executive room. This includes airport pick up, breakfast and complimentary wi-fi. I think this is slightly expensive though hotels in Delhi do appear to be expensive.The room was of reasonable size and very clean. It had a TV, a mini-bar (the contents of which were expensive) and tea and coffee making facilities.The bathroom was clean. My only criticism of it would be that in the Premium Room the shower wasn't in a separate cubicle which meant the bathroom floor got very wet everytime we had a shower.Breakfast was buffet style. It included cooked food of different types each day, cereal, toast, juice and tea and coffee. We also tried the restaurant one night and one afternoon. There was a good selection of food on the menu and it was very reasonably priced. Indeed the food itself was very nice. Mind you the waiter isn't very friendly unlike the other staff in the hotel!!The Hotel is situated in the Karol Bagh area and indeed is less than a 10 minute walk to the Karol Bagh metro station which is convenient for getting around the city. When walking to the metro station you pass through a very colourful market which is present on certain days.Unfortunately there was a lot of street noise at night whether it be vehicles or dogs barking. The noise was particularly noticeable in the executive room which was on the first floor (the premium room was on the 4th floor and was a bit quieter). However I would imagine street noise would be a problem in many hotels in the city.The area around the hotel is slightly rough. One thing which I didn't like was the hassle we got from touts the minute we stepped out of the hotel. However this was a problem no matter where we went in the city as was begging.The hotel appear to work with a nieghbouring travel / tour company. The staff from this company appear to sit in the reception area and wait for guests. On my first morning in the hotel the minute I got out of the lift I was approached by such a person who gave me the whole selling routine. This person was very persistent to the extent he was travelling up and down in the lift clearly looking for us. In saying that we did book a guide for Agra through the company as well as a pick up and drop off to the train station. The guide was very good indeed and we were glad we did go ahead with the booking.Overall we were pleased with the hotel. It is lovely inside though slightly expensive."
36,1636,"Jan 23 2009 	One star status budget Accomodation	It was their third offer of a room before we decided it would get no better. First room had creatures crawling around the shower floor. Second room offered had blood on the towel.The so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve wine(we had to locate/bring our own) and the roof of same is lined with bamboo, above which numerous pigeons reside, dropping feathers etc into one food while dining. Only one of our party(of three) was sick over a five day period, but we spoke to another resident whose friend was confined to their room for a couple of days with food related problems.Tried to charge for a non appearance as one of our party coming from Thailand to meet us in India had to alter booking(due to Bangkoks a/port being closed) only refunded us after several days of verbal discussions/culminating in our having to remind manager of our post holiday review intentions.Most definately would strongly advise against booking this establishment."
37,1636,"Jan 23 2009 	Tiny overpriced 	Our room was very small with a heater and A/C unit that looked like they were made 50 years ago. The TV was also dated.The staff were not friendly but capable enough. They organised a free pick up from the airport, but this was a dusty 15 year old tiny car. Luggage would not fit in the boot and had to go on the front seat. They organised a lift to the domestic airport for the 450 Rupees in a slightly better small car (but not much). The plus points are a nice restaurant up on the roof, with a very nice breakfast."
38,1636,"Jan 21 2009 	Not that bad at all but greatly overpriced	For CAD215 (USD 180) a night, greatly overpriced, like all hotels in India. The good: conveniently located in the quiet street of Karol Bagh, 5 minutes walk from metro. Nice rooftop restaurant. The bad: heater in the room didn't work properly. Electricity outlets were so outdated that small plugs (cell or photo charger) required support to stay plugged. Hot water was in fact just warm, so shower in the morning was challenging."
39,1636,Jan 9 2009 	Great Hotel	I stayed at this hotel on the 19th Dec for 2 nights and we had booked 2 rooms. We got complimentary airport pick up which was great. Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised we had got an upgrade on both the rooms which was nice to hear.The location is great for all the tourist sights. 1 thing i would say is dont book taxis from the hotel reception as it is a little bit more expensive than a normal taxi.Considering this hotel is a 3 star budget hotel i would say it was very good. I stayed at a 4 star in Mumbai and it was awful!Good value for money and if i was to go back to Delhi i would stay here again.
40,1636,"Nov 21 2008	Very Nice Hotel	This hotel is really nice, situated in one the best areas in Delhi, which is Karol Bagh. You just come out of hotel, then right and when you hit the main market street, turn right again and at the end of that street you have metro station Karol Bagh which it will take you to the main attractions or close enough to spend a fair amount on a auto rickshaw from there.Hotel staff is very helpful, and polite. We never used the pick up service from the airport because we always reached this hotel from the train stations. We raised this concern with hotel receptionist and he provided us with a courtesy drop off service to the airport instead. The food from the roof top restaurant is pretty decent and poison free. We never had meat as in the rest of India but saw lots of people eating meat and nobody complained or looked sick the days afterwards. This hotel is on the same area of others which look more economic like the Royal Holidays and the Hotel Classic but compare to these other doggy places this is far above in all aspects. You spend more but you receive quality in all senses, while on these other places, we stayed our first night in the Royal Holidays, we never could sleep as there works in progress in front of the Hotel and since we arrived they were trying to push us to make deals to visit using their touts what you can visit on your own. They just think that people are stupid and have not read enough before going to India.Here is all the opposite, taxi prices if you request one are reasonable, help is as much as they can, advices, internet free compare to others that try to charge you with 100 rupees for a crap connection, there shops in the vicinity and there is the great market on the street heading to the metro station.Definitely If I get back to Delhi one of these days I will stay here again and can recommend it to any one."
41,1636,"Nov 16 2008 	Decent enough hotel for a short stay	Hotel is a bit dated, and shows it in places. The hotel room we had was ok'ish. Mostly clean. The one big negative point was the aircon unit just above our heads over the bed and I mean literally just above, see picture. It was excessively noisy during the night and at one point spewed out a whole lot of built-up black grime from the street.The rooftop terrace would be nice if it weren't for the heavy smog of Delhi. Otherwise the food and drinks are decent and reasonably priced.Stayed there for a night, just before flying back out of India, so didn't get a chance to explore the area. It did look quite lively with street stalls at night."
42,1636,"Nov 13 2008 	""we love being care""	It was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel, the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night The hotel was good and clean, Hope fully i get what i payAs i fall ill was taken care of the staff with medicene food and service etc which touced my heart, may god bless them all, will recommend this hotel to everyone."
43,1636,"Nov 12 2008 	good hotel in crazy delhi	excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi.... karol bagh is a hustling area, but nice to have a quiet hotel... very friendly and helpful staff!!"
44,1636,"Nov 12 2008 	worst hotel ever stayed in	I would like to explain firstly that indian hotels are not of the quality you find elsewhere. That is a common theme i found throughout my stay in india and all travelers must bear this in mind before they travel there. However I was very shocked as to the state of the room especially baring in mind the positive reviews on trip advisor.The room was of a relatively nice size. However the room I stayed in would have gotten a 1 star anywhere else. There were very big cracks in the walls, the room was dirty. The airconditioning unit was very grimy, the bathroom was very shabby, the bath was cracked. All in all i am sure I could have found a hotel for the price I payed in am much nicer room. But i loved being in delhi such an incredible stay and it barely dampened our stay."
45,1636,"Oct 21 2008 	Haven in New Delhi	My husband and I stayed at the Clark Hotel in New Delhi both at the beginning and end of our trip to India. Overall our stay on both occasions was excellent. The hotel is well priced, conveniently located near the Metro line (Karol Bag stop), provides airport pickup and drop off, rooms are modern, clean and spacious (large comfortable beds, in- room safe for valuables, nice bathrooms), front desk staff are helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty, a travel service is available in the lobby which can arrange a driver and tours of the city. The overall atmosphere is very friendly and staff are competent and readily provide assistance. New Delhi can be a daunting experience with so much traffic, noise and confusion and so having a place to stay such as this makes the visit so much better. We found Pankaj, Rajesh and Ekta to be especially helpful and hospitable and would readily return on another visit. Staff do their best to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel for visitors to New Delhi."
46,1636,"Oct 13 2008 	Great!	We regularly stay at this hotel. On a budget this hotel is great value. The rooms are clean and modern. The staff is very accomodating, in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk. One of its main attractions is the location, right at the heart of the maddness. Love it. Mrs Shah UK"
47,1636,"Sep 29 2008 	Hotel Clark treated us awfully	My partner and I have just returned from a holiday in India where, as part of our itinerary, we had pre-booked our first two nights at the Hotel Clark International in Delhi through Expedia, for which we were charged 40.70 per night - a lot for India, but we wanted to ensure our first nights were comfortable.As part of our booking, we had requested the free airport pickup to the hotel, advertised on the website. We received our confirmation and were looking forward to our stay at the hotel.However, on arrival at Delhi International Airport, there was no one from the hotel to pick us up. As a result, after lots of trailing around the airport in the middle of the night, we managed to find a driver who was prepared to take us to the hotel in the city (at an extortionate rate).On approaching the city, I phoned the hotel to get their exact location. I was first told by the receptionist that we only had a reservation and not a booking. I informed him that we had prepaid in full and that I had a full confirmation voucher from Expedia.He then told me that, yes, we had had a booking, but they were no longer able to give us a room, and had decided to put us up in another hotel nearby instead. We were utterly dismayed given that we'd spent a lot of money on the first nights of our holiday to avoid this sort of hassle!Given it was so late at night, we asked for directions to the alternative hotel - Hotel Blue Sapphire. Although we were told this hotel was of the same quality as the Hotel Clark International, it turned out to be pretty awful . It certainly was not near the quality we'd be led to expect from the Hotel Clark International.Until now. our experiences booking through Expedia to date have been an entirely positive experience - but this was a nightmare. At best, Hotel Clark International messed up - at worst, they scammed us into taking a cheaper hotel, and didn't honour a prepaid contract."
48,1636,"Sep 26 2008 	Well priced all that you need	In Delhi you get what you pay for. When I'm here on business I pay around 200 per night compared to Hotel Clark's 35 per night. It isn't the most luxurious hotel in town, but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town. Well worth the money. Dinner and beer in the rooftop restaurant good and reasonably priced too. Breakfast is pretty boring though! Hotel will normally include a pickup from the airport. I saw some negative comments elsewhere about Abyss Travel. They are the hotel's &quot;travel agent&quot; for car hire etc.. If you don't want to use them, don't. You're not under any pressure to!"
49,1636,"Sep 12 2008 	Excellent Hotel in Crazy Delhi.	Look, its simple, unless you want to pay 200+ per night, then you will struggle to find a quality hotel in any big city in India. So reviews about this hotel saying mediocre, decieved or overpriced, ignore!! these guys did not do there homework before getting here. The Hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of things,clustered with back street markets and is extremely lively. Yes, the area is not the cleanest, but 75% of Delhi is like this. We based ourselves here for 5 nights, the rooms are clean and well maintained. The food in the roof top resurant is excellent and the staff really friendly.If you want to see, feel and smell Delhi and thats probably why your are visisting this city! then stay here."
50,1636,"Aug 27 2008 	Very good experience	The rooms on the fourth floor are very nice. We had a so-so room on the first night , and then we heard that the rooms on the fourth floor were better and so we moved up for the following night. It was great. Spotless, crispy white sheets, a clean modern bathroom. Breakfast is good, the view outside is great. The hotel collaborates with a travel agent named Haroon, who is excellent. He made various bookings for us and we found him friendly and reliable."
51,1636,"Jul 20 2008 	Over-priced Mediocre ...	Well, it would be unfair on my part to discard this property altogether but at the same time I am unable to find justifications for having it at No 14 on TripAdvisors popularity index. Lets start from 0:0 to the last whistle i.e., the moment we checked out. Check-in was anything but smooth. Despite having an explicit pre-paid reservation for two adults and two kids (6, 4) front-desk was insistent to have 600 INR/night for extra bed. Breakfast was not at all impressive  yeah even taking room rates in account. Bathroom standard should have been better. TV was not working, there is only 2-3 channels tuned in  we never tried to tune in more nor did we complaint, to be fair. Room service was prompt and efficient. Wi-fi was complementary and of acceptable speed. To conclude, I would say that you dont really get value for money at this hotel. I am not satisfied, let alone impressed."
52,1636,"Jun 21 2008 	What a shock but a good one in the end	I have been to Delhi 4 times in the past two years due to my hubby working out there. This time we were on holiday, I booked the Clark International via there web site which was so easy.We arrived in Delhi late at night, the hotel car picked us up from the airport, when we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel where I had stayed previously. We appeared to have arrived in downtown Beirut but once inside the Clark International I was presently surprised. We were taken up to our room, which was lovely, the bed was very comfotable with crisp clean sheets, air con cooled the room very fast and a great hot shower.The next day we got went up to the top floor for breakfast which had everything you could want to eat with a great view. We then went for a walk and headed down to Connaught Place to do some shopping, when we arrived back to the hotel later that afternoon we realised we were positioned slap bang in the middle of the market district of downtown Delhi, it was great, it had street markets, lovely people, great places to eat and shop and a great carnival atmosphere until late into the evening. I couldnt believe that my hubby had been to Delhi so many times and never found this area. I loved the hotel and loved the area, next time I go to Delhi I will stay at the Clark International.TIP: Take a card from reception when you travel about as we found a lot of taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was as tucked down a side street, the card has a map on the back with address and phone number."
53,1636,"May 16 2008 	excellent value	this was our first time in Delhi - we wanted a not too expensive but well kept hotel - and the Clark International conformed to our expectations. Clean, smallish but well-kept room (with noisy a/c) friendly and helpful staff.The area is noisy and colorful, which we rather enjoyed. no bad surprises. recommended."
54,1636,"Apr 9 2008 	A winning combination	My brother and I were returning to India after many many years to discover the origins of our parents. Our mother (Tess) was Indian and our father a British soldier. I was born in Devlali and left as a baby.It was therefore important that we had good accommodation in Mumbai and Delhi. And certainly the Clark gave us this.The staff at the hotel were very helpful; the rooms were great and the breakfast second to none. Several times we also had lunch which was very nourishing. If we needed any help with minor things that can usually go wrong on holiday the staff acted quickly and efficiently. We found that they had a winning partnership with Abyss Tours which many other car operators must envy in Old Delhi. The pick up and drop off at the airport went smoothly and we negotiated very competitive rates from their able and competent manager ,Arif, for a sightseeing tour and a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Altogether a very satisfying stay. Congratulations to both teams at the Hotel and the Abyss.Raymond RaineUniversity Senior Lecturer UK"
55,1636,"Apr 6 2008	Don't ever use Abyss Travel	Bed ok, bathroom passable, meals passable general staff attitude ok. The major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel...they are a joke, so see through makes you laugh. All the old tricks...obvious plants lies, lies lies. It's a shame that a &quot;could be good hotel&quot; has to associate its self with, and promote, Abyss Travel. Please don't take us for fools."
56,1636,"Apr 3 2008 	Great value in the heart of things!	This little gem is right in the &quot;horn honking&quot; center of things. My room was small but clean and comfortable. The staff were all very kind. There was a bit of an internet snafu when I first arrived, but the manager stayed with the problem until he got it fixed and I could get online. I could walk to all sorts of shopping and the hotel has easy access to taxis, etc.There were several tour groups staying in the hotel while I was there...so book early, the secret is out about this one."
57,1636,"Mar 12 2008 	good value	the hotel is in the heart of new delhi in a non-touristy area.be prepared for a different culture, but do not be afraid of the neighborhood. free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food. the bed was comfy and the room was clean. you may need to use ear plugs at night because of dogs barking and autos honking. if you do not use the free ride from the airport, you can use the free ride to the airport. the hotel price was okay; not too pricey and not too cheap."
58,1636,"Mar 6 2008 	4* quality at 3* price	A really recommendable, clean, friendly hotel with all mod cons (inc wi fi) in a busy - though not exactly central - part of town. By Indian standards it's very fairly priced too, so book well in advance to be sure of getting a room."
59,1636,"Feb 22 2008 	A great find and good value for your money!	After reading several reviews on-line, we booked the Clark International for 2 nights. We were very pleased with this hotel and believed we got very good value for our money. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and were very happy to assist in arranging drivers, tours or train travel at competitive prices.They have a cute roof top restaurant. Good Indian, Western and Chinese food, and a &quot;business centre&quot; where you can check your internet. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and we highly recommend it to others.Any inconveniences of this hotel were very minor:1) Like many of the places that we booked on line, it said that our room included free airport pick up and we requested this through Expedia, but it did not happen. So, if you would like airport pick up, double check that a driver will actually be there to pick you up.2) Hotel is located in a busy market area. I was happy to not have to walk alone outside of the hotel at night. The street noise could definitely be heard in the hotel rooms (as is the case throughout Delhi) so bring earplugs!3) Totally my own fault, but I left my sandals in the hotel after I checked out and went back the next day to get them but was told that they had been &quot;thrown out&quot;. So triple check your room when you leave!"
60,1636,"Feb 22 2008 	very good value hotel	Efficient, good value hotel. Reception staff not particularly helpful or friendly but efficient. Included breakfast was good, and Nepali &quot;head&quot; waiter very friendly. Evening meal good value and good. Room was clean, quiet and secure. Had coffee/tea making facilities which is unusual. Also minibar with reasonably priced drinks, including water, which is useful if you have just arrived from the airport. Efficient pick-up from airport even though plane was delayed. Handy for Metro."
61,1636,"Feb 1 2008 	Little Gem	Stayed on two occasions in Jan. One night at first then 3 nights after a 6 day train journey.We were met by friendly courteous staff, they helped us to locate an ATM on the first stay as it was a little daunting in this very bustling city. The rooms were clean,the bathrooms had bath, shower, all very clean, mini-bar &amp; air con,TV and free internet connection. There was some traffic noise but unavoidable in such a busy city and no fault of the hotel. The breakfast was very satisfying,cereals,hot foods, eggs etc. Lunch and snack &amp; dinner menus varied &amp; were very nice and the waiters very nice,helpful. We would recommend this hotel, it was quite a &quot;little gem&quot; considering the price of some hotels in New Delhi, we would stay there again should we return someday. As we didn't take advantage of their free hotel pick-up on our arrival in New Delhi, they kindly gave us a free drop off to the airport for our departure."
62,1636,"Jan 31 2008 	Highly recommend the Clark International New Delhi	Have just returned from a week based at the Clark International New Delhi. Our rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day, bed linen was changed daily, hot water was plentiful (though the wet room style bathroom was a little inconvenient), staff were extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. Restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good. Room service excellent. The only downside was that the location was a little rough, as a party of four women travellers, we did not feel particularly safe stepping out alone and we were glad that we had booked the services of a driver for our stay. Would highly recommend the Clark International hotel as being very good value for money."

My husband is Indian, but not from Delhi, and we really didn't know much about hotels in the city except that there seemed to be very few moderately priced hotels. After a great deal of research on the Internet, we selected the Clark Hotel. It was very clean, with good airconditioning (except during the daily power cuts). This was important as we were there at the height of summer. The staff was very helpful, but not all spoke good English. They tried their best, and we managed. This is not a five star hotel, obviously, but it was clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast buffet was good, with toast available for picky eaters (like my children). Indian food, as well as some &quot;international&quot; dishes like chinese food, etc, was also available for all meals, and was not hideously spicy. Even the Indian food was not too spicy. They are trying to cater to American/European palates, I think. However, I think that they are bringing in the food from another location as the &quot;restaurant&quot; appears to be a room with no kitchen attached. This can cause rather long wait times for food (think 30-45 minutes after ordering). This can be a problem after a long, hot day, especially with small children. There is a neaby McDonalds. The area is really, really busy with cars, people, beggars, etc., all the usual India issues and at night there is a market which might be fun to explore if you don't mind the mosquitos. We didn't do this as the kids were exhausted at night. The area might be a bit of a shock if you have never been to India before. Overall, it was a good place to stay for a few nights, especially if you don't want to spend spend hundreds of dollars a night for a 5 star property, but you want a clean hotel with western toilets (very important) and A/C. The pick up from the airport was included, but the drive back was not. One other note for female travelers, is try to get some Indian clothes, like a salwar kameez. Even during the hottest of days, it is very comfortable as they can be made of very light cotton. I saw several women wearing tank tops and shorts, and they are usually being followed by groups of strange men. Not pleasant. In India, if you wear shorts and sleeveless tops, you may as well be walking around in your underwear."
64,1636,"Jan 26 2008 	Great Hotel for the price	Yes, we had agreat time at the Clark after staying at a couple of similar hotels which were 'nasty' Don't have any doubts about staying there the place is very clean and the food brilliant,staff could'nt be more helpful. You can arrange for a driver to take you around Delhi for a fixed price so no worries there. I recommend you pack ear plugs even at the top 5* hotels you can hear the road noise from your hotel room.We had no problems with the water, hot water all the time. Electric went out from time to time but that happened every where in Delhi.We stayed there for 2 weeks and if I can remember it went out twice to come back on in 5mins or less. The outside of the hotel was dirty and would not liked to have walked outside on my own but that is the case all over Delhi."
65,1636,"Jan 10 2008 	Do not be deceived!!	Thanks to Photoshop, they've managed to delete all the electrical wires hovering over their shaded windows, their neighboring buildings and whatever else that looks nasty in their surrounding. So when you look it up online, you would think that the hotel is in a nice, quiet area. We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by, horns beeping, people's voices, et al. Not very comfortable when all you need is a good night's sleep. We had a portable heater in our room and it wasn't working, so we phoned the reception to replace it. They did...with another non-working unit. Great. The room and bathroom is OK and the bed was clean. But we didn't really get value for our money. We think the hotel is overpriced especially with the location."
66,1636,"Jan 1 2008 	OK Hotel Great Breakfast	Pros: Good hotel in Delhi, offered free airport pickup. Great breakfast included in room price. Room had a modern feel."
67,1636,"Dec 29 2007	Good mid range hotel in Delhi	My friend and I stayed here in September, the only fault was they we're revamping the reception which was transformed in the space of 24hrs - no mucking about! And it really didn't affect us just added to the adventures of India.We were picked up as promised from the airport which I highly recommend, the room was excellent (we chose to stay in one of the suites).The travel guide in the hotel sorted us out for our private car trips around Delhi, Taj Mahal and then onto Japiur.Food here is excellent so we ate here on both evenings!"
68,1636,"Dec 15 2007 	Would avoid	I did not have a great stay here. Initially when I booked, they told me a taxi from the airport was part of the package. When I arrived, they charged me 500rp for this. Then when I left, they tried to charge me another 100rp because the car was airconditioned. Also when I arrived, my room smelt like a sewer, so much so that someone had to come in and spray air freshener. The next day I changed rooms, and this was OK, so try NOT to stay on the bottom floor. The restaurant is OK with nice views. The hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir. However the internet was free. The service was very mixed. Some people were helpful, others were downright rude, especially the man who asked me to pay extra for the taxi. I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers."
69,1636,"Dec 14 2007 	An amazing hotel in the middle of the chaos that is Dehli.	Having booked through Hostelbookers.com and read all the reviews, my boyfriend and I were worried about the hotels condition. I called the hotel 2 days before departure to book the airport transfer, the man was waiting ready for me. We arrived at the hotel at 6am way before check in time, but they allowed us a room at 1/3 of the normal rate. The room was amazing, all European amenities, a huge double bed and a 32&quot; flat screen TV all you could ask for in a room. we booked deluxe. We were pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay there again. Please do not be put off by the surrounding area, as you are in India you need to keep an open mind. Also the food in the restaurant on the roof is amazing, we had a tandoori platter for rs350, enough for two people. If you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed."
70,1636,Nov 25 2007 	Best Night Manager and very fine rooms	I am a teacher who went with a colleague and 6 students on a Trip to India.We spend our very first night in the Clark and this was the best introduction to India. Although the hotel seems to be in the middle of mayhem it is a quiet spot and very western in all its amenities. The rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience... we had everything down to the bathroom slippers. The Night Duty manager &quot;Chakraworty&quot;) could not have been nicer and fullfilled every wish of us spoiled Westerners. Of course we had wireless free internet which was another plus because I wanted to let the student's parents know that we arrived safely.Breakfast was also super and served on the roof top. One amazing experience.
71,1636,"Nov 24 2007 	Great Market area in Karol Bagh	Great Hotel, the staff were fantastic and helpful always. I was here with my wife, 1st time to India and we started on a tour in Delhi first. After you get over the initial shock of the driving, poverty and the streets you will grow to love this little gem of a hotel. The hotel is literally a 30 second walk from Karol Bagh market which is great fun, especially as we were there for Divali so the streets were lit and fireworks everywhere. You will get beggars in this area but you will find that throughout India which is a shame as there are so many homeless children. Change is a serious problem so try and get as much as possible as you wil get harrased. Travel agent name Arif is fantastic and i swear he works 24 hour days as he is always there. He arranged tours, transports etc and we had no problems. The Hotel Dining area is brilliant, situated on the roof and very open but with covering, food is of a high standard and service excellent. Dont believe everyone who says that Delhi is expensive compared to say Agra or Jaipur, that is only on certain items. My final comment is once you get over the shock of the streets leading to the hotel you will enjoy your stay, when the driver said we are here i nearly fell out of the car, but after my trip to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur &amp; Mumbai i enjoyed the experience of Delhi the most."
72,1636,"Nov 19 2007 	Oasis of calm	We were in Delhi for the VIV India Exhibition at the Pragati Maidan, cost was a consideration when I chose the Clark International but we felt we had excellent value for money. The location is rather challenging, the noise and general grubbyness can be off putting but once you are inside the hotel everything changes. We reserved a suite, (this was still a good price compared to the 4 and 5 star hotel prices) and it was great. A large canopied bed with beautiful clean linen and a bathroom with a marble floor.The rooftop restaurant is very good, the food is excellent and although the hotel does not have a bar you can get a beer with your meal. Breakfast is decidedly Indian with not very much concession to European taste but we always found something suitable.The staff are very helpful, especially the travel agent, after the show we had set aside time to visit Rajasthan and it was organised for us very efficiently by Abysss tours.Overall I can recommend this hotel as being good value for money."
73,1636,"Nov 15 2007	Nice clean room	Pleasantly surprised about this hotel that we booked for the last night of our stay in India. Very clean and functional room (401), helpful staff. They agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didn't need by an airport drop-off early morning."
74,1636,"Nov 15 2007 	A Cozy Hotel in Delhi	I stayed there November 6-13. The hotel staff is very attent?ve, the decor is tasteful and the rooms are comfortable. Breakfast on the rooftop is very pleasant -- ask for Chai (that's delicious Indian spiced tea), not the teabag option! The hotel is located in Asia's biggest shopping area, Karol Bagh. The ultra-modern Delhi Metro station is 5 minutes from the hotel. From there, you can get to Delhi's commercial and business center, Connaught Place, in just a few minutes more."
75,1636,"Nov 10 2007 	Ok hotel but not great we expected better	stayed in this hotel 3 nights Oct 07. transfer from airport good as we were 90 mins late the driver waited for us..our room was dissapointing ,room 407. no view blacked out widow ( a concrete wall behind) I guess it was quiet apart form hearing the lift go up and down all night.No hot water at all during our stay. Roof top restaurant average lacked a few green plants lots of bird poo on the edges of the terrace, but delhi is delhi. food nothing special. wouldnt serve us beer but others seemed to have it.( whether they took it to the table themselves)We booked with late rooms and when we came to pay extra tax (luxury tax ) was added on the bill this was a laugh as this hotel was clean but def not luxury. not at all like the website pictures we looked at before booking, staff ok but not as friendly as other hotels we stayed in."
76,1636,"Oct 24 2007 	Bed smelt of wee no hot water.	We hit the Clark International Hotel after 3 weeks in Bangalore and a couple of days in Udaipur. It was the worst hotel in our trip.My wife and I are from Australia, I was in India for work and my wife joined me after 3 weeks for a bit of an explore. We booked through Otel.com, and paid online for an Executive room, one up from the normal room type. However, when we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room, which had been painted that morning (paint still wet to touch) and found that the booking had somehow come through to Clark from Otel.com as &quot;standard double&quot;. We were there 3 days and did see other nice rooms but were told that these were not available.No hot water, we had to call the lobby each time and request. Then a man would come up to our room and put his hand under the shower for 10 minutes while the boiler or something fired up, and my wife stood around in a towel. Ah, the romance of India. The bed smelt of urine, and we did eventually get it replaced on day 1 which was good. Lots of renovation going on, but they did give us some free meals at the hotel restaurant which was some compensation. To go shopping we booked a van and driver at an exhorbitant price from the hotel travel desk. The driver got sulky when we wouldn't get out at the &quot;commission&quot; place that he recommended, and dropped us in the middle of nowhere, which was quite scary. Avoid...try somewhere else..."
77,1636,"Oct 15 2007 	Not bad for Delhi	Hotel was ok, was being decorated so constant smell of turps. No window which I found a bit weird. Breakfast was good on top floor restaurant, staff generally helpful."
78,1636,"Oct 2 2007	Bad Don't Stay Here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Booked via Expedia 3 weeks prior to stay. Included in room price ($100 AUD) was airport pick-up. On arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up (they were not bothered). We pulled up to hotel and parked - an auto (tuk tuk) accidently scratched the drivers old rusty car, the driver got out and smashed the auto guy across the head...meanwhile we were stuck in the car. Nice welcome!Check in, typical India...cold, fill out forms etc. Taken to room way way down back of hotel near generator. Room tiny, and in disrepair but neat (on surface). We thought O.K...it is Delhi (overpriced and poor quality).Within the hour...&quot;bang, bang&quot;, the sounds of drilling/sawing and metal banging. After 2 hours we called reception and asked when will the sound stop...&quot;oh 5 minutes&quot;. So after about 40 mins we thought lets go and see reception desk. Upon leaving our room the door was open adjacent. We walked into room where 2 guys were painting, the room was luxurious compared to ours and large. So we thought as we booked a superior delux we can change room. We walk up a level to see what the banging was and found all floors under maintanence, people everywhere painting, just crap everywhere.So we went down stairs and asked to see another room. &quot;No rooms&quot; we were told. We asked to see the manager...&quot;You wait&quot;. So we sat in foyer....after 30 mins of waiting we went up to the room, expecting the manager to call us when he was able. No call. About 45 mins later we decided to pack backpack and go into central Delhi for better hotel even though the Expedia / hotel took our money upon booking and credit card had already beeen charged.At reception the manager appeared. He was not bothered by our request nor concerned that we left. We did mention we would be complaining. We think they preferred not having guests at this time, cause we did not see 1 single guest during our 4 hours here.We complained to Expedia the next day, and they contacted the hotel and a refund was in the process (1 week). We would recommend not to stay here. No restaurant, no alcohol in mini-bar.We travelled for 6 weeks in India/Pakistan and by far this hotel was the worst we encountered."
79,1636,"Oct 1 2007	Decent Value	We opted for the most expensive room on the property, which was around US$125 per night. We were favorably impressed, the room was clean and very comfortable and the bed very nice. The hotel is located in a noisy and busy area, and to be honest when we arrived at the hotel we were not terribly impressed with the exterior of the building. However, the staff were very friendly and the other hotel guests we chatted with in the lobby loved the place, so we gave it a shot. The food is rather good and the rooftop restaurant is charming. Overall good value for the money but probably won't stay there again simply because the neighborhood is incredibly busy and very congested. If that doesn't bother you, try it out. Otherwise a good hotel."
80,1636,"Aug 23 2007 	a no go.	I booked on expedia.com, choosing by price ($110), thinking there are a slew of hotels in the $30 range and a slew in the $300 range, and this would fit right in the middle. It did not. It is not near a 4 Star hotel, but what in India would be called a 3 star. Rooms are noisy, &quot;India Clean&quot; (sort of scruffy) and not worth more than $40. It seems the hotel is advertising on places like Expedia looking for people shopping by price -and trusting that you get what you pay for. While this is true generally, in India it is generally less true. Also, they overbooked us and moved us on the 2nd day of our stay: to a &quot;3 Star&quot; that was less than half the price (although they attempted to keep the rate the same) but was actually nicer."
81,1636,"Aug 17 2007 	Comfort in Unknown Territory	Being a woman, alone and an inexperienced traveler, you bet I was nervous when I arrived in Delhi at 3:00 a.m. My flight was 4 hours late and I had no idea what to expect. A huge wave of relief washed over me when I found my name being held up by a friendly face at the front of the overwhelming crowd. The hotel was definitely dedicated to taking care of their guests.I was further comforted to be met with a strong display of professionalism at the reception, especially at 3:30 a.m. The other hotel staff were patient with my conflicting sleep schedule and did their best to help me obtain whatever I needed during those first hours.The hotels choice of tour agency to help me plan the rest of my journey to Rajasthan, Kashmir and Daramshala was outstanding. The employees of Abyss Tours were friendly and personable. I completely forgot the fact that I was alone in a strange land very far away from home. All recommendations of hotels throughout the tour were superb.I will always recommend all my family and friends who wish to travel to India in the future to stay at Clarks and use Abyss Tours to ensure that they will find the whole Indian experience as delightful as I did."
82,1636,"Aug 14 2007 	Enjoyed our stay at Clark International!	We stayed at this hotel for two days and here's why I liked it.1. The staff is very courteous and helpful.2. The rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets, they are provided promptly.3. The food is very good and their breakfast buffet is impressive.4. the hotel is centrally located and one can easily access major tourist attractions."
83,1636,"Aug 5 2007	Good Midrange Hotel	After having considerable difficulty locating a midrange ($50-$100) hotel in Delhi for a personal visit, we settled on the Clark Intl. based on reviews on TripAdvisor. We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. 1) They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. They come in an Indica (small car) so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance.2) Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean. Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what $50-60 per night can get you in Delhi. The area around the hotel is not great (in the middle of Karol Bagh) - that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp. the courteous staff.3) The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional.4) We had made our own taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing and there was no pressure put on us by hotel staff to use their services. They did organize airport dropoff for us when requested.Overall very happy with the hotel - would definitely stay there again if going thru' Delhi on personal visit."
84,1636,"Aug 1 2007	Not a bad deal for the location and facilities	The hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station . The facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well .The complementary breakfast is good . The negatives - the surrounding areas are not too good , but you cannot have a central location like Karol bagh and peace together. They provided complimentary pick up from airport (because it was free the driver did not run AC and we did not particularly insist although it was hot) . The reception staff was also helpful in arranging early morning taxi drop off to Nizammudin Rly station.Overall a good value for money proposition and above average clean facilities in a central location."
85,1636,"Jul 3 2007 	Better than expected	For our arrival in Delhi my partner and I were looking for a clean but basic hotel at which to spend our first night. After reading reviews for other hotel in the sprawling city we decided upon the Clark International.As promised the hotel duly provided the complimentary pick up from IGA as promised. Although we were informed by email before we arrived that as we were to arrive at 0800 we would not be able to check-in until 1200, this was not the case. The hotel was able to accommodate us immediately, which after a long journey was greatly appreciated.The room was basic but spotlessly clean with a working air cooler (rather that air conditioning) which was noisy but apply drowned out the street noise below.As anticipated we were offered trips, booked through the hotels' travel agency, but when we declined their offer there was no 'hard sell', unlike a lot of India.The hotel is not centrally located but is a short five minute walk from the efficient New Delhi Metro."
86,1636,"Jun 17 2007 	Great buy off season	I picked the Clark based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Got a good deal through hotels.com and then hoped that I had made the right choice. It was. My pal and I had a terrific room in a not-so-full hotel, for an off-season price that made my friends' jaws drop (people always tell me Delhi doesn't have mid-range hotels -- apparently, we found the only one). Our two-bed room was very clean, we had air conditioning, a fridge, ceiling fan, cable TV, nice bathroom, and a very nice staff happy to help. It was as quiet as can be expected (for *Delhi*). The staff recommended a travel company nearby to rent a car &amp; driver for a day, and the driver took us to a fantastic shop for clothes, then to a beauty parlor near the hotel to get a very reasonably-priced manicure and pedicure. The second day, when we told the staff where we wanted to go, they recommended we take the metro, which isn't too far away by walking, and is a terrific way to get around. There is some shopping not too far away from the hotel -- shoe stores are good, but the clothing stores weren't so great. There aren't really restaurants around, so you will have to rent a car/driver for that (room service is decent at the hotel). I found the hotel a great respite at the end of each day. Will definitely stay again."
87,1636,"May 26 2007	Comparatively Impressive	In general, Delhi is a shaddy place, full of touts and scammers. The Clark is relatively safe, clean, and a good deal for a budget hotel. Our room did not have any windows, but the sheets were incredibly soft and clean; the beds were comfortable, and the airconditioning a blessing. The hotel is also near a local night market and only five minutes from the Karol Bagh metro. Do not trust the hotel tour guide! He brought us to his office and pretended to call the train station for tickets. He lied about the seat availabilty, luring us to his expensive car rides. Rather, check with ABC (?) travels, which is on the corner of the hotel block. In all, the hotel was a decent stay, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
88,1636,"May 9 2007	Beware of being bumped!	We booked three rooms in advance for the Clark International - but despite having our bookings confirmed (and our credit cards charged!), on arrival we discovered that the hotel had over-booked itself and were abruptly ushered round the corner to a much lower standard hotel.Although our booking was with the Clark, we can only review it on the basis of the accomodaiton they supplied us with: the rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowing toilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; the hotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentified dripping in each room during the whole night); and the breakfast cutlery was not clean.When we confronted the manager of the Clark International about being moved to inferior accomodation, he claimed that it was due to a business conference, and as a result the cost of our evening meal was waived - but we still left feeling shortchanged and somewhat disappointed with the experience.The communal areas (including the restaurant) in the Clark seemed of an acceptable standard - the roof terrace is worth a look for the sight of a heaving city.However, even if we had a cast-iron guarantee of a room at the Clark, we would probably not book there again as the hotel does look rather tired."
89,1636,May 8 2007 	excellent hotel. you get very good service delicious food for a very reasonnab	Francoise Wang-Toutain. french nationality the location of the hotel is very convenient. Delhi metro station is a 5 minutes (may be 3) walk and the metro goes directly to Connaught place. The staff is very welcoming and help for finding places where you want to go. the restaurant on the fifth floor gives a view of this part of Delhi witha large and very clean terrasse The food is very clean and delicious (I mean for a foreigner like me) the room are comfortable (though I had not the most comfortable one). The cleaning is done correctly everyday. the internet is free access. Also on the road to the metro station you have a nice market selling indian clothes and also daily life things. It is opened until 9 o'clock in the evening. It's a niceplace to spend some time. I stayed for ten days in this hotel for I was working In New Delhi. It was nice to come back every evening in a clean and friendly place. I would recommend the hotel for those who do not like the snobbish atmosphere of the great palaces of Delhi but still want good qualities rooms and services.
90,1636,"Apr 18 2007	Acceptable two star hotel	I stayed at that place twice, with quick and friendly check in. Rooms on both occations were small but rather clean with surprisingly good bed linen. Bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets. Good towels provided and they even had toiletries. Neighborhood is an extremly busy and loud bazaar area with traffic that drives you crazy. Since no taxi driver knows this hotel, suggest you print our the location map from the hotels web side. Personally, I prefered to eat at McDonalds just around the corner, or a Pizza Hut 300 meters away, not really finding the hotel restaurant appealing enough. For cheap internet access and even printers, there is a place right next to the hotel."
91,1636,"Apr 16 2007 	You get what you pay for (in pounds dollars 	As several other visitors have noted, there are very few mid-range priced hotels in India. I am an American and have lived in Bangalore almost two years and find it's low end or Taj properties, all over $150/night with not much choice in between. The Hotel Clark International itself was nice, but was on a narrow side street in an older part of town. I appreciated the pick up service from the airport, even though the plane was over an hour late. The driver tried to hustle me to a travel agency almost immediately, but we needed time to rest because my traveling companion was not feeling well from the flight. After an hour, he took me one minute's walk to Indian Tribal Tours (see my review in Delhi info). The dining room is on the top-5th- floor, but the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor, so it's not handicap-friendly. Check in and out was efficient. The buffet breakfast was fine; omelettes could be cooked to order. There is both inside and outside seating. I asked for a quiet room and we were given a small room with no windows. Actually, the A/C unit was in the window. The hotel was a bit pricey for India and what we got, but I'm not going to complain about it."
92,1636,"Apr 15 2007 	New Delhi	Great hotel - very basic but great service. The hotel was a bit noisy between 7am- 7pm because of the market, but you felt like you were in India and not a sterile 5* hotel.My two children loved it and we had a great short stay in Delhi."
93,1636,"Apr 15 2007 	Good service. Nice Place. Great Value.	Clark International is a fine hotel. Our rooms were clean. The room service was quick and food very good. All of the staff were very pleasant.We took advantage of the pickup from airport as well as a trip to Agra and a tour of Delhi. The tours were good and the pickup is handy. The hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements from the moment we landed to our departure. This is an extra cost, on top of the room, but well worth it. It made things very easy and enjoyable for us. We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Delhi for a few days. There is a bit of street noise at night, as the other reviewers have said, but it is tolerable."
94,1636,"Apr 15 2007 	Safe Clean and Trying hard	Clark International DelhiTrying to maintain a decent standard of budget hotel in a chaotic city. This is clean, safe (at least for us), with services, fittings and staff that work, if all look rather tired, and decent if not exciting food. Use a locker for your valuables. There is no free mineral water, but its only about 15r from the minibar, and there are supermarkets through narrow doors and sometimes in the basements in the major shopping street, one short block from the hotel (where sundries will cost next to nothing).If you arrive on the early UK flight your room isn't likely to be ready until the guests check out and it's serviced, so you'll need to hang around in the restaurant, with an accumulating number of guests until it is. Pay for breakfast ~300r whilst you wait, other breakfasts and transfers are normally included, all explained on their website which seems accurate in text, though the pictures are overly flattering, and taken with an estate agents eye! We could not discern any advantage of our 'presidential-suite', apart from being marginally higher up from the traffic, so I'd suggest booking based on ensuite/no-ensuite and being done with it.Be prepared for standard scary Indian driving practises on the pickup, but the management will come to both the airport and the train station with a board whilst the driver waits (including meeting you from your carriage in the later case) which is very helpful if you take the all air-con out-early-late-back express (thoroughly recommended) to Agra for the day. There will probably be a couple of mini power outages or fluctuations during a day as well, which will trip the TV and air-conditioning, but normally last &lt;30s.The hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops, be prepared for noise, dust, disorganised telephone lines, stray dogs and dilapidated store fronts. It can be a bit of a shock if this is your first stop in India, the rest of the city is much the same, but there is a huge jump up in cost to the better hotels which have gardens and gates to sheild you from this.There are two metro station within a short walk, Karol Bagh is the one to head for, the other requires negotiating a difficult junction. The hotel has a useful if slightly haphazardly scaled and street named map. Its well worth collecting this along with a business card in order to get back to the hotel via an Auto through the myriad streets. We couldn't find a prepaid auto stop nearby the hotel, but there are plenty in the city centre to help you get back.The restaurant is on a roof terrace which gives a good view of the urban roof top landscape, for better and for worse - geckos on the whitewash, palm squirrels scampering on parapets, kites circling in the smog, continual honking of horns, inexplicable sirens, horns or drums (depending on the date) and endless dust. It's done out in Bamboo, with nightlights and waiter service and tries it's best. The Indian style food is better than the western, the breakfast is an odd mix of the two."

They provided good service beyond my thoughts. The hotel clark is three star amenities but they have some five star facilities. I got pick-up on time as they promised. Food was really good,bit spicy but i like. Staff was very friendly. And one of the best interesting thing is free wi-fi. Room was neat &amp; clean &amp; specially beds &amp; linen. Finally we enjoyed lot. My suggestion for travellers: Avoid any type of reviews &amp; use your exprience &amp; mind.Peter Goh"
96,1636,"Apr 10 2007	Clean safe and well staffed. Pity about the noise...	Although I'd concur with other reviewers comments regarding this being a clean, well maintained and well-staffed hotel, I can't really go any further without mentioning the street noise, which a light sleeper would really struggle with. Hard to blame the hotel for this but worth pointing out.The pick-up service was good and appreciated given our delayed arrival at Delhi Airport but I found the hard-sell tactics from our pick-up regarding procuring guides and further travel tickets a little tiresome when you've just arrived off a long flight. The hotel staff were however, efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transport/tourist issues.Also worth pointing out for the uninitiated, that Karol Bagh (the area in which the hotel is located) is a long way from the tourist sights of Old and New Delhi, although the hotel is just a five minute walk from Delhi's crowded but otherwise excellent new Metro system (Karol Bagh stop). So the airport pick-up makes even more sense in that you can get a grip on the geography of the place before you venture out.All in all, just about worth the money but be careful if you are a light sleeper!"
97,1636,"Apr 10 2007 	The Objective Truth	First of all in order to provide readers with unbiased review, it will be best to start with the general context. First-timers in India, especially travellers from Europe and the US should know that India is very different place from home, not saying good, bad, beautiful, or ugly, the word different incorporates all those adjectives. My word for India would be spicy. When I arrived at the airport, I felt a little disturbed, it cannot be compared to the Munich airport that I left. The facilities looked much older, it was dirty and the place was crowded with colorful people. OK, I needed a coffee urgently, first surpise was that there was no schwarz coffee available, don't you even think of a good espresso, so I had to go for a nescafe. On the way out of the customs, a driver holding a sign with my name was waiting (I requested from the hotel my complimentary pick-up). The trip to the hotel was an adventure itself, people cooking in cauldrons on the street, small cars and motorbikes everywhere. The traffic is very busy, all cars scratched and those people horn vigorously, in fact, due to the fact I guess that they drive on the right side, on the buses you see the signs &quot;Keep distance&quot; and &quot;Please horn&quot;. This habit of pressing the horn vigorously, I did not like, because in the Clark hotel, I could easily hear those, because of the ill-fitted windows. Well, the first night it bothered me a lot, from the second night on, I got used to it. A few words for the hotel - it is situated near Khan Road (Ghaffar market) and honestly it is very busy area, dirt, small shops, street vendors, ugly buildings. The hotel itself is OK, reasonably clean and the staff was friendly, but I would expect more for 60-70 EUR a night. There was hot water during the first day, then disappeared, then came back. Breakfast was...OK.... I had an omlett, some toasts and butter....the rest I did not eat. I had troubles finding good quality food. My Indian hosts, however, brought me to a distant beutiful residential area, to a restaurant called Chopsticks - excellent place (I remember it was located in Asiad Village)The hotel has a computer room with ppl who reply to e-mails, 3-4 of those young ppl I saw. Here I must mentioned that before picking up Clark international, I had hard times finding a hotel in India, and my travel agent could not help me much. Later speaking with my Indian hosts, one of my suspicion was confirmed - mid-range hotel in India is not what the European traveller expects. OK, Clark Internation is really a mid-range hotel for India, some of the other hotels in the area, those with fallen letters from their signs, really scared me. So, in New Delhi there are some very shitty hotels, some that are OK, like Clark International, and good hotels, which I later saw. The good hotels are located around Counnaught place.......beatiful gardens and luxury, but available for a bit above $ 300 a night. Some names of those are: 1. Hotel Imperial2. Hotel Le Meridian3.The Park4. Shangri La5. Ashoka Palace5. Taj MansinghIt is your choice, some people like to walk in the dirt, in those charming markets and bargain, however I got sick from the food and water (no ice, only bottled water), I had a three-day diarreah when I came back home, but this is because I was not cautious enough. I saw beautiful palces (Humayun Tomb, Qutub Mnar, Sagrafang Tomb, Museum of Handicrafts, India Gate.....), lovely gardens and everything is cheap."

Airport transfer is included.Location - centrally located. good for shopping. metro station is close by.Suggestion - Keep tissue boxes in the rooms.Downside - not suitable if you are arriving by own car, since there is no parking facility.Overall rating - very suitable for travellers who are used to international quality hotels."
99,1636,Jan 16 2007 	Excellent Service - good value	We stayed at Clark for 4 days. Bookings were arranged directly with the hotel - we were picked up (even though our plane was delayed and we were over an hour late) and presented with roses (a bit OTT but still a nice surprise!). Staff very helpful and check in/out was very smooth.Rooms were fine - probably worth going for one up from the standard so you are higher up and away from the street noise. There is also a local market one road down that starts 5-ish until late (except Mondays) - very useful for picking up nick naks and getting quick deep fried snacks from. The hotel is about 20 minutes tuk-tuk ride to Connaught Place and about 35 minutes in a taxi from the airport.They organised a car and driver to take us on an Agra tour - much cheaper than the tour operators in the area.I have a suspicion that the food is brought in from a kitchen out side the hotel - but room service was always prompt and good value for money. The rooftop restaurant lacks ambience but worth a visit so you can watch the eagles swoop for their dinner - you can also get very close up to them as they land on the roof.The hotel doesn't have any alcohol listed on it's menus - but can still be ordered off the bill!

2,1638,"Nov 24 2009 	""A Home in Karol BaghDelhi away from your Home""	Hi! I am a business person from Bangalore and i am happy to share my experience of my stay in Hotel C Pak Inn . Past 1 year i am visiting Delhi atleast 4 days in a month for my business. I had searched for a decent hotel in karol Bagh and finally I got this C Park Inn throu my friend. Almost a year now this C park Inn became a Home for me in delhi away from my Home. After each days business meets i am so relaxed and i feels that I am at home in this hotel. The Manager Mr.Udham Singh is very kind to help the guests and i was amazed to see the way he conducts him to the foreign tourists. I must tell their Staffs Ashok,Praveen and Ravi , all are pleasing guys and will assit you without any hesitation.Staying here is a peaceful and pleasant experience for me, it is simply a luxurious at a reasonably economical price.I wish all the best and keep going C Park Inn!"
3,1638,"Nov 22 2009 	Good Midrange Hotel In New Delhi	Despite of several inconveniences during my stay here (no toilet paper in my room, no hot water in the evening unless you ask for it beforehand, air condition in room 206 is noisy, I had no bedsheets) I still recommend other people to stay here. I stayed here for 4 days. It is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the management/staff are good. They advise you in a very firm tone with travel advices etc - you don't feel that they are giving you that particular advice in order to make some rupees (which is something I have often felt when talking to the hotel staff in India)."
4,1638,"Nov 19 2009 	A great hotel	I stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The rooms were really clean. The staff was real friendly and knowledgeable, and helped arrange various tours and day trips throughout my stay. I would definitely stay here again, no question."
5,1638,Nov 1 2009 	will be back in the future	A good budget hotel.Very nice manager en staff.Are very helpfull.Shops are close and also the metro station.You can book your trips in the hotel.The manager can give you good advise.
6,1638,"Sep 21 2009 	Great Hotel!	There are many hotels in Karol Bagh, Delhi, India. The C Park Inn is one of the best! The rooms are clean &amp; comfortable. The staff is very frienbdly &amp; helpful. And you can't beat the price. This is my SECOND stay here and I plan to stay here again when I return to India. I give the C Park Inn my very best recommendagtion!"
7,1638,"Jan 29 2009 	Very comfortable and convenient stay	This hotel is clean and comfortable, with good facilities and helpful staff.

9,1638,Sep 27 2009	opinioni sull'hotel cpark inn
1,1641,Oct 28 2009 	Not a bit like the website	We were disappointed with this hotel.We should have researched it better.The pictures on the website are misleading.My tip would be to make sure you read reviews carefully before you do your booking and maybe only book 1 night at a time until you see a place.The airport pickup was a plus.
2,1641,"Oct 25 2009 	A++ Warm friendly 	We booked this hotel from the airport through lastminute.com and we reluctant to leave the taxi upon arrival (basically a very busy commercial street!). Once out of the taxi we were greeted by friendly doorman who took us to reception and from there on the experience was great.Staff were very friendy, going out of there way to help us to ATMs at night (safely) and to get to and from India including help in booking a great taxi service to the Taj Mahal competetive with train fares.The shower water pressure isn't the greatest - but that is possibly a consequence of being in India. Rooms were cleaned - food service was efficient and tasty.Is a bit further from Connaught Place than we thought - but is reasonably accessible by taxi at 60 Rs each way."
3,1641,"Oct 6 2009 	Sweet Home	I Booked through the website- made the most of the offers they have on it- stayed for 3 nights got one night free and also a agra trip free. paid $45 per night though..The hotel is very comfortable compared to the hotels in that locality, seriously. This was my 3rd time in delhi and stayed in express 66 for the first time..excellent i must say..the rooms were clean, the staff very friendly and helpful and in overall a very homely atmosphere they have maintained. the food in the hotel was also good.The other hotels in the same locality are very very shady...i recommend everyone to say who are looking for excellent accommodation in a budget price.p.s also beautiful rooms!!! thumbs up guys.."
4,1641,"Sep 24 2009 	bad express	We were so unhappy with this hotel, When we saw mouse in our room we all are scared and all jerk staff start smiling. Slept there one night because we had no choice. Coughed most of the night because of the smoke-embedded room. Eyes were on fire for a full 24 hours after checking out. Even the guy at the front desk thought it was horrible. Id call that false advertising of nce and clean rooms."
5,1641,"Sep 7 2009 	superb staygreat services..................!!!	We had serched for the hotel through internet.We contacted the hotel people on telephone,and booked one executive room, we reached Delhi by Rajdhani express in the evening from a hectic tour in calcutta. As said there was a hotel guy on the station waiting for us with a car. we were then taken to the hotel which was hardly 5 minutes drive from the station.At the lobby we were offered welcome drink (Coke).After completing the formality we were taken to our room.The ambiance of the room was very good as shown in the picture on their web site.The services were good and the staff was very humble and polite and always ready to help.The hotel people arrenged for a cab for local sight seeing and a trip to Agra at a very cheaper rate.and the Taxi driver too was very friendly and polite. we stayed in the hotel for 7 days. In all we enjoyed the trip to Delhi.I would always recomend the hotel to all my friends that whenever they visit Delhi they should stay in Hotel Express 66."
6,1641,"Sep 2 2009 	Great stay	we reached delhi at about 10.30 pm.we were exausted as we came out of te Airport the pickup cab was waiting for us as promised by the Hotel.It took 35 min.to reach the Hotel from the Airport.As we reached the hotel lobby a guy was standing there to welcome us with a glass of refreshing drink.Then we asked the front office manager to show the room.we were offered the executive room which was in every way very comfotable AT VERY LOW PRICE according to my budget.As we were late we asked if they could serve us the dinner,and they said yes they can ,so we ordered for Indian food and it came in approx. 25 min. the food served was hot and delicious.We stayed in the hotel for three days and we never felt that we are away from home as the staff was very soft and polite and was always ready to help..............................In short we had a GREAT STAY and enjoyed a lot."
7,1641,Jun 13 2009 	average one	I travelled to delhi for business purpose and was looking for some hotel near to pahar ganj &amp; found Express 66. Hotel is quite ok with all the required infrastructure &amp; other facilities. wi fi also good.only thing is the location. situated on narrow road with full of traffic &amp; bit difficult to find. staying there in small budget is a really worth!!
8,1641,"May 15 2009 	not bad	stayed here for 2 nights.. good service friendly staff at front office, rooms were clean and was informed that these were recently renovated .. looked better than the ones on the website quite surprising. use of jazzy wallpaper's and wooden paneling not bad...."
9,1641,Mar 28 2009 	not great	i booked this after finding it in a search engine.and reading some favourable reviews. our 3 night stay was our final leg of a month travelling around india. it was very disappointing from the outside and i went to inspect the rooms before we unloaded the luggage as i thought it couldnt possibly be the same place. it is located on a very busy main road home to the timber and aluminuim industry which is in use 24 hours so if you are a light sleeper like me then not ideal. the room and bathroom were clean (apart from the room floor as our feet soon got dirty walking around barefoot after our shower) bathroom is modern and has a shower curtain which is always a plus in india as all bathrooms tend to be wetrooms so everywhere gets wet! there is no restaurant and you have to order breakfast (which was included in our package) and any other food via room service which is then brought to your room. (a service charge of 10% is automatically added to this bill which we didnt know until checking out). as we were out all day sightseeing etc we decided to eat at the hotel in the evening too (also becuase there didnt seem to be any decent eating places around the area) and opted for plain food -macaroni cheese with mushrooms. even this was spicy and made with tomato sauce and cheese just melted on top. 2nd night we had chips and cheese toasties which werent too bad. 3rd night my husband and friend had the macaroni and mushrooms but they both ended up leaving it as it didnt taste right - they have been ill since. i had the vegetable noodles which werent that great either. my friend's husband stuck to eating curries and he was fine. we had to leave at 4.00am for the airport and transfers were included. i had asked for a large car but we were given two small cars so had to travel separately. the male receptionist had to be woken up so we could settle the bill and seemed to fall asleep whilst talking to us! there was some confusion over the complimentary breakfast on our last morning. my husband had asked for plain omelette which turned up with spices and onions. they charged us for one of the juices as we should only have had one glass as complimentary (i think this was the gist of it). i asked to check our food orders for the previous days and pointed out that we hadnt been charged for any breakfasts on the other mornings as it was included in the price so they waived it. nothing is walking distance - connaught place and karol bagh are accessible by a 3 wheeler (dont pay more than 40 rupees for this). on exploring the are we found that there are lots of little shops in all the side streets off the main road. i wouldnt use it again
10,1641,"Dec 4 2008 	Shocking vicinity but folks try to do their best	Arrival was a shock: smog, smoke, dust, metal traiders, wires... Hotel starts from 2d floor. No trees around. Nobody knows the street and the hotel. Exterior looks totally different. But the room was clean, normally equipped. Personnel tries to do their best, but it is not a normal hotel for normal people. It suites for local to stay between railway travel - New Delhi Railway Station is in 500 meters.I've spent 2200IR per night, it costs such a price, but for 5000IR they ask now its better to find a hotel in another quarter. You cant open windows both because of dust, smog and noise. WiFi doesn't work. I was transferred to another room without my will, but nothing was stolen.Finally we even ate there, no stomach problems."
11,1641,Jun 20 2008 	Good value in Delhi	We stayed at Express66 for 3 nights. The hotel was clean and represented excellent value for money in Delhi. The external appearance of the hotel differed from photos that we had seen but rooms are as they appear on the website. The hotel isn't on the best street in Delhi but at least it's not in the heart of busy/noisy Paharganj. Our deal included breakfast but there is no restaurant so this had to be taken in the room which isn't ideal. Overall we would recommend this hotel.
12,1641,"May 27 2008 	A Small Paradise	This hotel is a wonder in it self &amp; one of the most beautifully designed hotel from inside. The locaion is a bit crowded but being in the city center one could expect that much of crowd.The hotel rooms are spacious &amp; elegantly designed. The best part is that everything in the room was in perfecty working condition which we didn't find in any other hotel in India. We spent three nights there without any complaints &amp; all the staff members are very friendly.One of the cleanest hotels I have ever seen.Total value for moneyExcellent Service High hygiene standardsFrom the airport pickup till the departure from the hotel, It was a wonderful experience altogether.&quot;DEFINITELY A COME BACK HOTEL&quot;"
13,1641,"May 26 2008	EXPRESS 66 one more 6 to hell	I stayed one night in Delhi and I did the choice for Express66 believing in what other reviews said about it. When we arrived the zone seemed devasted by war. the smell around was terrible and everything was filthy and ugly. The hotel entry looked like an ugly storage buiding with nothing nice. once inside the hotel wasnt that bad looking but when we entered the room many details were wrong firstly we tried to swich on the TV it didnt work (no conectors). When i told to the staff they send one guy whom after looking the conector he went away and never came back with solution. The room we booked it was a double twin beds and they said on arrival they only had one bed double. When I tried to turn on the light on the bed table the light wasnt connected either. there we was surrounded by dust everywhere. then the morning came and I had to go to airport early so i went reception and i asked for place to have breaksfast wich was included in the room deal. they said &quot;dont worry, well take it to your room&quot; so I went to my room and we waited. after one hour the breakfast never arrived and we had only 5 minutes to left to the airport so I went reception and they were there looking at me from a very lazy position showing too much a lack of care.we got so upset that we didnt want to take the drop off with them and we left without breakfast by rikshaw to the airport for less than half price of the car. we came back to Delhi a few days later and we stayed in Ajanta Hotel about two streets behind where Express66 is located and believe me i got double quality for half of the price. clean nice and very professional staff. who did the votes high rates to Express66? themselves?Fran"
14,1641,"May 9 2008 	Do not be cheated!	This hotel is run by frauds! We had selected this hotel based on its high review on TripAdvisor and its relatively low price.The hotel is in a very shabby part of the town. There are some abstract paintings on the walls, but that's about it. The room had a damp smell. The hand shower in the toilet did not work. Complaining to the manager did not work. We rented a taxi for half a day to roam around the city. When we got back, within the half day period, the travel desk said the minimum charge for the taxi is a full day. This was clearly not what the manager had said, who was not there later.We asked for advice on how to go to our next destination - Jaipur. The travel desk just wouldn't give any advice other than taking their taxi at a high price. When I enquired about bus routes, he gave me a myriad of logic not to take a bus. At first he said there were no AC buses to Jaipur, then he said there are no buses except at night, then he said it takes 12 hours to reach Jaipur, then he said it costs Rs. 800 for each person. Each of these were a lie.One reason for selecting this hotel was their free wifi. But it was a hoax, it did not work for more than 5 minutes.One guy slept on a sofa in front of our room, and we could hear him cough the whole night.At check out time, came the biggest shock. When we had taken the taxi, the manager said the charge would be Rs. 800 per day. But they billed us Rs. 1200 for a day! The room charge was Rs. 2999. When we said we wanted to pay in USD, they used a conversion rate of 37 Rupees instead of the bank rate of 40. It's not the few hundreds we paid extra, but the attitude of ripping off customers, that we disliked."
15,1641,"Apr 21 2008 	Very good	The hotel location is not very good, but the rooms are news, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have a great time in Express 66."
16,1641,"Mar 27 2008 	A Spotless Hotel in New Delhi	My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Express 66. We reached Delhi very late at night on March 19th, and the hotel pickup service was at the airport on time, awaiting our arrival. Honestly, Express 66 is not in the best part of town, but upon our entry into the hotel lobby, we completely forgot the streets outside. Our check-in was quick and efficient, and we found the staff very willing to cater to our needs. In fact , I had been in touch with hotel's MD several days prior to our arrival, and he was extremely friendly and accommodating of our requests. The rooms were very reasonably priced (something difficult to come by in Delhi) clean, and well kept. The MD has taken obvious care in maintaining the establishment thus far. A very creative and contemporary collection of art is also tastefully displayed throughout the hotel. My family and I also enjoyed several meals from the hotel's kitchen, and we agreed that the food was well prepared, and tasty. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who requires a clean and reasonably priced place to stay in New Delhi. You will certainly get more that what your money pays for."
17,1641,"Feb 28 2008 	Express66 is worth each penny	I am from Canada . I stayed in Express66 not once but twiceand have reservation for the third time. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean.

18,1641,"Feb 17 2008 	new and clean hotel	The hotel is new and it is quite small (there are only three floors with a few rooms per floor). The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are new. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are very eager to assist customers in any ways possible. Our experience dealing with the staff was very pleasant and they made our stay quite comfortable. It can get a bit noisy at night if you have a room with a window towards the street (which happens very often in hotels in Delhi, unless you are in the more quite areas such as the Diplomatic Enclave)."
1,1647,"Oct 14 2007	There has to be a better place....	We had a choice of this hotel or Yorks Hotel. Sorry to say our group was booked in this place. Upon check we only needed 5 rooms, the hotel was not confirmed with a credit card and the front desk had a fit and we had to take the 6th room. After a grueling 1 hour they agreed to give the single rate for the person in the room. The staff took up most of our groups baggage and very clearly stated they wanted a bigger tip then what the individuals gave. We had 4 rooms with inoperable showers/tubs. The water backed up the drain under the sink and flooded the bathrooms. There was only 1 room that they would change and changed again and again and still flooded. The hotel was not very helpful with problems. The beds were comfortable and clean.There is not lift/elevator so be prepared to walk up 4 flights of steps to the second floor.There was a roof lounge and we did use it well into the night.The hotel wanted payment the same day we checked in. They then insisted we pool our money for all the rooms and pay at one time since they had no change to give us they said.We tried to change money at the front desk and they refused.Even the bank next door refused to change money. Thank heaven for Thomas Cook across the street.The worst part was their so called security guard. We were kept getting a bad feeling about him. One of the single room (lady) returned to her room to freshen up and he followed her into her corner room. She stopped him dead in his tracks and went face to face with him asking what the bleep he wanted. Complaining to the front desk was worthless. They just said he is security.I would not stay here again since there were many choices in the area. The area was nice for shopping. The hotel did have internet for 60INR (30 minutes). The straw that broke the camels back was at breakfast. The ladies ate early for 150INR however when the gentleman came down to eat (the same breakfast exactly) their bill was 91INR.We noted this to the front desk and they said he ordered less items. Not true. Thank goodness it was only 1 night. We would have relocated if it was more."
2,1647,"Sep 29 2007 	Don't stay here!!	OK, it looked nicer on the pics I've seen on the hotel website. And yes, I admit that this hotel is the best locationwise as it's in the center of Connaught place. However, when I first stepped in the hotel, the smell instantly made me sick. When I got there, my room was not ready, but they let me have a look at the room anyway. Whoever stayed before me, that person is absolutely disgusting. Cigarette butts were all over the floor, and the bed sheets were stained... and the bathroom!?? OMG, I don't even want to talk about it. (refer to the pics I posted.)They made me wait outside until they finish cleaning, and guess what!? It took less than 5 minutes to clean that messy room. They didn't change the sheets.. ahhh...Be aware of the travel agency they'd introduce to you. They charged me Rs.2,200 for the bus trip to Agra, but it turns out everyone else on the bus paid Rs.550 or less. They said it would be a new, large, and air-conditioned bus and most tourinsts would be from European countries. Oh, well.. I was the only non-Indian on the bus, and it surely sucked. Do not stay at this hotel. You don't want to waste ~$70/night for this crap. I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand before this hotel. You can get good deals from Asianrooms.com , so try. This hotel is not the best Intercontinental.. but since it's really hard to find decent hotels in Delhi, i think this hotel is really nice."
3,1647,"Apr 3 2007 	decent hotel in connaught place	a few points:1) this is NOT 'Jukaso Inn', it is 'Hotel Jukaso Inn' - these are 2 different hotels - yes it is confusing!!2) i gave this hotel 4/5 (&quot;above average&quot;) as for delhi it is above average. i would probably give it 3.5/5 if i couldok, basically delhi is really hard to get a decent hotel that isn't ridiculously expensive. well this is an exception. it is a decent hotel in a very handy place, connaught place. it isn't beautiful but it is decent and clean with a good size room, bed, tv and shower/bathroom. the A/C was so-so as you couldn't choose a personal setting, it was basically a grill in the wall with cool air coming in. but the room was nice and cool so i didn't mind. there was a fan that could be controlled too.the breakfast was pretty good i thought though my girlfriend didn't like her eggs (no problem, i ate hers too!). it had 1 computer for internet use and at 68Rs (why 68?!!) per hour wasn't very cheap. other than that this hotel was grand. they were helpful with storing our bags all day as we had a late flight. and they helped organise a taxi for us.so in short, booking hotels in delhi is a nightmare cos all the reviews seem to be so bad, or else they are ridiculously expensive. well if i was ever staying in delhi again i'd stay here, and i would recommend it to a friend."
1,1651,Find another place	The hotel is not very clean. Staff is ok. Near airport. Dining room ok. But I would suggest finding a 3 star hotel. An Indian friend made the reservation for our departure next am. Wished he would have gone for a better place.
2,1651,"Sep 1 2009 	Good if you have an early morning flight	This hotel is very practically situated near the airports, so if you have an early flight (domestic or international), you won't have too much trouble. In fact, they will organize a taxi to the airport for you. The rooms are quite spacious and fairly well equipped. One negative point is that it can be quite noisy at night due to the traffic on the highway just outside the hotel."
3,1651,"May 4 2009 	Great service	I booked this hotel through Makemytrip. It was a nice hotel, and specially recommended for people who are travelling through airlines, because it is close to both airports(Domestic &amp; International). It is also value for money and staff was cooperative and helpful. Condition of room was excellent(neat, clean &amp; tidy)."
4,1651,"Apr 22 2009 	Horrible hotel DO NOT STAY here	I read the reviews before I booked this hotel. There were a total of 4 reviews, 2 of them mentioned filthy sheets/stains. I was not sure and I took my chances since it was so close to the Dehli airport, and it was the true reason why I chose it. The bed sheets were in fact filthy and disgusting. We checked in the hotel around 11pm that night, and left very early the next morning to catch a flight from Dehli airport, so thankfully we only had to stay in this hotel for a few hours. Regardless, I couldn't get any sleep thinking how filthy the bed was. We asked for a change of sheets, and what they brought was as filthy as what was there before. When we started taking out the old sheet to put over the new ione, the amount of disgusting stains on the matress and bed padding was simply disgusting. I do not recommend you stay here if you want a clean place. I tend not to be very picky, but this was too much. The have made an effort to put a reception desk as if it is a really fancy hotel, don't be fooled by it, the rooms are not good, and they smell. You are better off in any other hotel"
5,1651,"Mar 7 2009 	This hotel is terrible	There were blood and other unknown stains on the sheets, bugs on the floor, and neither the hot water nor the heater worked--this was an issue because it was very cold at night and the window was ajar due to the window cooling unit. After a complaint to the front desk the hot water in the bathroom sink began to work, but not in the shower so we had to use the dipping bucked to transfer water to the shower to take a ladle shower. This is a terrible hotel--you would be better off at some hostels."
6,1651,"Jan 27 2009 	Nearby the airport	If you want a base near the airport and dont mind sleeping in filthy sheets this hotel maybe will be a good choice. The hotel is pretty good located if you have an early morning flight. Its only a few minutes with taxi to the International and National Airport. The rooms are well-sized, the beds ok, but staying their in the winter is extremely cold and draughty (no heater). Indeed it is a budget, 3-star hotel but still you expect it to be clean and tidy. The hotel is simply not well-managed!The good thing was that the staff was very friendly and helpful."
7,1651,"Jun 5 2008 	Good value. Great airport location. Wonderful staff.	I felt the Lohias represented a good value. Adequate air conditioning, clean, hot water shower, accommodating and pleasant staff that went out of its way to help me.It's a budget hotel, so I wasn't expecting luxury, and was not disappointed.Decent restaurant, but don't expect meat w/ your breakfast!! (Same for other nearby restaurants.)The hotel is on a highway that runs along the airport, but is about an 8-minute ride from/to the terminal. Lohias is located amongst a strip of mostly budget hotels along a major road, with an intriguing neighborhood behind it through which I enjoyed strolling.Admittedly, there were problems with the hotel. The first room didn't have the hot water it was supposed to have, but staff promptly upgraded me from a Deluxe to a Suite, for no extra charge.The suite was quite spacious. I experienced a hot-water problem, but staff quickly fixed it. Great A/C and overhead fan actually made the room COLD until I adjusted it.Yes, I would absolutely stay there again if I were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near the airport."
8,1651,"Mar 22 2008 	Reasonably priced and convenient for the airport.	The Lohias has seen better days, but in a city full of grubby and overpriced flea-pits it is a pretty good choice for an overnight if you are arriving or departing from the airport at an inconvenient hour. The room was quite big, clean by Indian standards, and there was hot water in the shower, although the &quot;inclusive breakfast&quot; was so pathetic it was barely worth eating. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming even in the middle of the night when we arrived, but beware of their pre-paid taxi fares - a taxi to Central New Delhi should only cost about 200 rupees from here. You can make a credit card reservation for it on www.travelguru.com."
1,1652,"Nov 14 2009 	Use as a last resort---	Some pros and some cons. No hot water. Beds and room okay, but bathroom not so clean. Three agressive bell boys insisted on helping with our two bags upon jet-lagged arrival and all wanting tips. Had trouble with AC. Breakfast adequate. Desk staff helpful. Don't stay here unless you have to. Not a good experience."
2,1652,"Aug 14 2009 	Excellent triporganizer!	Me and my husband stayed here by a coincidence for two nights in august 2009. The hotel is situated on a good location, not far from anything if you have a driver (we had one through the hotel) or if you use the three wheelers. The staff was very helpful and friendly! We also got to know the hotel owner; mr. Naresh (Pintoo) when we wanted to book train tickets for Agra. The whole thing ended with him advising and organize a 13 day trip through Rajasthan with car, driver, hotels ,and guides in some of the cities. We got to see much more of India then we would have expected to see, which we are very grateful for. Our driver Kashmira was an excellent driver and a good and helpful friend through our journey. We would absolutely recommend this hotel and triporganizer to everyone who wants to see more of India!"
3,1652,Jun 26 2009	Trip was great!	The hotel Madonna as well a the other tours and services offered were fantastic. I travelled with my mother who is a very nervous and picky travellor and even she liked it. The hotel is clean the staff is somewhat efficiant and they all want to make your stay as happy as possible. It is highly recommended for a comfortable and easy stay in New Dehli!
4,1652,"Jun 15 2009 	Perfect week good service and very friendly	picp-up from the airport by an excellent driver directly to the hotel. Very good welcome in a nice hotel. Direct communication with the owner wich can tell you a lot about india. If wanted he can arrange for fixed prices day trips and you'll be treated like his guest all the way. For people that do not like to arrange to much from home you can trust this hotel to arrange reliable transport (best driver DEEPAK!), hotel stayings and sightseeing. Me and one other friend that really did not have any expectations in advance are very happy to have booked this hotel almost randomly. It turned out to be one of the best choices we could have made. We have visited india for just one short week and we have seen so much, Delhi, Jaipur and Agra really are incredible!"
5,1652,"Jun 11 2009 	Modest rooms great staff!	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Madonna on three separate occasions while traveling between other cities in India. We really liked the night manager, Tripathi and our taxi driver, Kashmira. They were fantastic and generous and made our stay a very nice one. I must say that the hotel is a modest one and we chose it because I thought it was close to the airport, but it is at least 30 minutes away. They do offer a free pick up from the airport and free breakfast which is made to order and delivered to the room! The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff could not be nicer. They became our friends."
6,1652,"Jun 10 2009 	Excellent stay with affordable rates	Found staff and owner, Mr Naresh, to be very helpful and really enjoyed the tour organised by the hotel to Agra and Jaipur. Will definitely recommend."
7,1652,Apr 27 2009 	good hotel for the money	stayed for 2 nights whilst we did the taj and delhi sightseeingthe hotel arranged for our pick up at airport everything went very smoothlywe did tours thro the hotel and they were worth every penny driver was excellentonly problem not many places to eat around the hotel but we found a little veg restaurant up the road and had a superb thali for 1 hotel restaurant ........... well its not arestaurant really they fetch food in at least we can now say we have had the ultimate indian takeaway lol it seemed odd while sat waiting for your meal to see a man run in with a carrier bag food was good but a long wait whilst they fetch it from wherever all the staff were helpful especially the managerwe upgraded to a luxury room it was large and clean but not luxurious but it did the hob ti was supposed to
8,1652,"Apr 25 2009 	Affordable honest and friendly	We had a wonderful time here thanks to Mr. Naresh who provided us excellent services, being very professional and a nice human being making us feel like at home.George &amp; Helene Lazar"
9,1652,Feb 28 2009 	Cheap Clean and central hotel	This hotel was a good clean hotel right in good location to the main attractions of Dehli. The staff were brilliant and very helpful and polite. The price was very reasonable. I would stay here again on my return to Dehli.
10,1652,"Jan 19 2009	Naresh (owner) gets rave review	The hotel car and driver (complimentary) was waiting for us at the airport complete with sign. Naresh also arranged the same car and driver for our tours of Delhi, and Agra over the next two days. Puri, the driver, is probably the best driver in all of India, plus he also was very knowlegeable, and professional. Puri (on his own time) at the end of a long day chauffeured us to a great restaurant.We also appreciated Naresh's friendship in offering his office and computer to us at anytime so we could try to find our missing luggage as well as track our cruise ship which could no longer come into Mumbai because of the attacks.We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful. The beds are king size, and the room was clean. We always had hot water and air conditioning.Thanks again Naresh and Puri.Teddy and Ed from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"
11,1652,"Jan 5 2009 	It had its ups and downs	Well our stay was decent. When we arrived at the hotel they told us to go here so we got cab and arrived at the hotel. When we arrived they said were out of triples sp we will upgrade you to a suite, so we thought great,we got a suite. It turns out the room was so-so, with a refrigerator, hot showers. At night there was a lot of street noise and one mourning outside our hotel there was a parade at 6 a.m. All these things we tolerated but when we went down to ask for towels they said &quot;we'll bring them to you&quot; so they could get a tip and one guy just sat outside our door until he got one. The location is so-so and it's really near anything. They did have wi-fi (not in room), cable tv, and by the way the restraunt sucks, when we ordered they ran out and got from a different restraunt! Overall you can find a better place, us this as a last resort"
12,1652,"Jan 4 2009 	Smashed it :-)	Had a brilliant stay the hotel was comfortable and clean and provided everything we needed including a brilliant sightseeing tour of Dehli and then the key highlights of Rajasthan. The staff were the best and had a warm personnality.Again this was awesome so much so we stayed there once we returned from our Rajasthan tour. The location is spot on in the right part of town close to the sights and the conveinence of the ATM's, Banks, Shops ... thoroughly recommend this hotel when staying in Delhi."
13,1652,"Dec 2 2008 	Great Place to Stay	We where referred to the hotel by the tourist desk on arrival in Delhi Airport. At the hotel we warmly welcomed by the staff and interacted directly with the owners. This personal touch led us to plan trips to the mountains in the North and the desert area South. We obviously use the hotel as our base stay for all the travelling done and really enjoyed coming &quot;home&quot; after the long trips away. The hotel is rmarkable in its hospitality and caring attitude of all staff and management, especially that we do not speak or understand any local languages. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Being fussy about ablution facilities we felt very at home in the neat and superb facilties. The hotel is ideally situated to travel in and around Delhi as well as a good departure point that does not get too involved in the hustle and bustle of the traffic congestions. I would definitely refer this hotel to travellers in Delhi and as a planning point for all tours. The hotel also operates a tour company with well mannered drivers who know the routes adn advise about places to visit and purchase gifts etc. I would definitely use this hotel in the future, it is also competitively priced."
14,1652,"Nov 20 2008 	Highly Recommended	My wife and I just returned from a trip to India which started and ended at Hotel Madonna. The hotel, especially our rooms, were clean and fairly quiet, but what we liked the most about the place was the staff, who were not only helpful but genuinely friendly. The owner, Mr. Naresh Bhattia, was also able to provide advice and services for travel in his part of the country, which for us meant Agra, Jaipur and Pushkar. He set us up with a superb and resourceful driver who also turned out to be a great traveling companion and a kind of bridge to the India we otherwise might never have seen, and the hotels he booked were at least on a par with Madonna, and in the case of Pushkar, a real gem. All the foregoing at reasonable rates. So we don't hesitate to recommend Hotel Madonna and its wonderful cast of characters, starting with Mr. Bhattia, through Mr. Singh at the night desk and Protap Singh, our driver and friend. Mr. Bhattia also booked our flight from Delhi to Kerala which turned out cheaper than booking it directly from the US."
15,1652,"Nov 13 2008	Loved it	The Hotel was nice and clean. The services were excellent. People were very helpful, when you need something the were always there.The only thing need to be upgraded is the shower. Otherwise we were very happy to stay at this Hotel. The train is nearby the hotel and very nice to ride in. The Hotel had tour trip if you want to see other part of New Delhi. The Hotel provided us the tour pkg. which included the car and the driver to Jaipur and Agra to Taj Mahal. The Hotel on the way was excellent. We had no problem at all, everything were arranged very well. The own of the Hotel was very helpful. We didn't have to do anything even when were were in the city he gave us the car to tour the city. Tourist from Canada Nov/2008"
16,1652,"Nov 10 2008 	Hotel Madonna a good choice	The Hotel Madonna for a mid-range Delhi hotel is in my experience a good choice, with very helpful and friendly staff.This is the second time I have stayed here. I was again picked up from the airport free of charge at 03:00 in the morning - very efficient.My previous complaint about having no wireless internet is no more, as this is now also a free-of-charge feature of the hotel. The manager even has a spare GSM card for emergency guest use, should the connection fail (which it did not do during my six day stay).Importantly the hotel is just 10 minutes walk from the metro and 5 stops from the station Rajiv Chowk/Connaught Place, which means that one can get around easily.Frank"
17,1652,"Nov 7 2008	Avoid	We booked our stay at Hotel Madonna through Expedia, prior to consulting a print travel guide on India. The lobby is just as pictured, but the room we were given was nothing like those on the websites. The room was adequate, but definitely NOT worth the price. The surrounding area is far removed from many tourist sites, and not really an area you want to explore on foot. We asked about the complimentary internet access, but the hotel staff were unable to get their computer running Windows 95 to work--they just kept checking the cables and turning it off and on. There are much better places to stay in Delhi. Avoid the Hotel Madonna as it is overpriced and not in a desirable location."
18,1652,"Oct 30 2008	Lucky to know	I am a customer since last three years for the hotel madonna, the first time I visted india I was not familiar with india. I was along with my wife and were in India for her treatment purpose. i was worry how the hotel will be and how it could treat us?Realy the hotel owner Mr. Narish was a very open mind and nice person. Apart from the hotel was clean and all the people were working were so polite the owner was alwayse asking if we need his help in travel inside India and was arranging the trip outside Delhi on very comportable price.After we visited Delhi for four time, and it became for us like our own house, or house for our friend."
19,1652,"Oct 25 2008 	Great hospitality!	We stayed in Hotel Madonna for the major part of our stay in India. In between, we made a trip to Jaipur and Agra organised by the hotel. It was a great trip, very friendly driver and very good guides!The hotel looks very good, nice clean rooms and good facilities. Breakfast at any time, and close to the metro and central places in Delhi.The owner is very friendly and really made us feel at home here, arranging whatever we wanted in no time. Thank you for the great time we had in India!"
20,1652,"Oct 20 2008 	Loved the maddona	We were warmly greeted at the airport,by hotel driver no charge.,Taken directly to hotel. Greeted by Mr.Singht at the hotel manager, asked if I wanted dinner and after a 24 hr. flight those were the words I wanted to hear. After dinner was escorted by the bellman [Sanjay] to my room which was immaculate and very clean with all western amenities including A.C. Staff was very accomodating any requests I had were fufilled,even when I left hotel I was offered a hotel business card, Staff was always concerned and wanted to make sure I always knew the way back.I had the pleasure to meet the owner Mr.Pinto who was truly a gentlemen and even sat down with me to to show the city center and directions to the popular places in town. Many Thanks to the staff at Hotel Maddona"
21,1652,"Sep 24 2008 	Dont Book Here!!!	We had contacted the hotel a few days before, that we would need to be picked up from the trainstation at 10.30pm. We had done this as we wanted to be safe and the hotel ensured us this would not be a problem!! Once we arrived and 45 minutes of waiting and on the phone the hotel told us to get any taxi and they would cover the cost. Once we finally arrived at the hotel, the manager who was very rude proceeded to argue with the taxi driver and try to get us to pay. He tried to do the same the following morning when wanting to check out. By now all we wanted to do was go to bed. When we finally got to the room it was horrible!!! Large ants all over the floor, dirty bathroom, no towels and rubbish in all the corridors. Couldnt wait to get out of there!!!"
22,1652,"Aug 20 2008 	Excellent inexpensive clean and friendly	I was coming to India on a business trip (it was my first time in India). Before the trip I started to look for the accommodation in New Delhi and discovered that the choice was basically between very expensive five star hotels and one star hostels/hotels. Nothing in between. I could not find anything that would match European 3-4 star standard and price range. Additionally, I planned to take couple of days off in India and see the country. So I needed a private tourist programme arranged by the hotel. I almost gave up on finding something for reasonable money when a colleague recommended me Hotel Madonna. I staid in Hotel Madonna and was very happy with the choice. I also sent there couple of my colleagues from Brussels who were equaly happy with the price, quality, service. We all had a very good experience with Hotel Madonna. The hotel arranged the accommodation, airport transfer (I was arriving in the middle of the night to New Delhi from Europe and the flight had a 3-hour delay, nevertheless someone was still waiting for me at the airport to bring to the hotel), the hotel also arranged my tour programme with the personal driver and a tour guide. I had most of my meals in the hotel. The accommodation was of good European 3-4 star standard. All the above was provided for very reasonable money. I would certainly recommend Hotel Madonna and will be back there again!"
23,1652,Aug 15 2008 	not clean	Just kept seeing cockroaches.
24,1652,"Jun 8 2008 	Unpleasant stay	Rooms were dirty, staff was unfriendly. I know I shouldn't expect much but it didn't fulfill the lowest standards."
25,1652,"Apr 7 2008 	Hmmmm	We booked this hotel not knowing much about Delhi. It turned out to be quite expensive for what we got although the location was pretty good, very noisy street, but where isn't in India. The rooms have carpet which is filthy and quite frankly carpet anywhere in India is a bad idea. Staff were friendly enough, the breakfast staff had very limited english and the breakfast was very average......I don't think I would stay here again"
26,1652,Feb 18 2008	loved the complimentary cookies	was picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel...delightful!!Check-in was quick and easy. The owner was in thelobby..a nice gentleman. He made arrangements fora car to take us to Agra..the charge for the hire wasnot bad. The driver was very nice and helpful. Enjoyedthe complimentary cookies every evening!Would certainly visit again.
27,1652,"Feb 17 2008 	Great hotel in ideal location.	Hotel Madonna in Delhi was very convenient to all Delhi landmarks. The hotel staff were great, literally waited on us hand and foot and arranged all our trips, which included Agra and Delhi sights. We made a comment about the great biscuits we found in our room each evening after returning and the evening prior to our departure the owner send us two boxes of biscuits each, that was six boxes for three people, i was impressed!"
28,1652,"Jan 9 2008 	What a DUMP!	Arrived in middle of night by taxi, very expensive rider, operator did not have reservation, put us up in room, dirtY, smelly, slept on top of bed as someone had already slept on sheets. Had help with luggage, but would not leave until tipped and tipped well!Bathroom was very small, you could, sh_t, shave, shower all in one position as you could not do anything else! Supplies were limited to a little toilet paper, no soap, one wet towel.Checked out early, they do not take credit cards...what we were told, only cash...I paid $60 and friend paid $100 only bills we had on hand.In very bad area.....STAY AWAY!"
29,1652,"Jan 3 2008 	Great friends there!	The staying was nice; it was a clean place. But especially, Naresh, the owner, is a greatly wonderfull friend that made our days in Delhi a safe, really nice trip."
30,1652,"Jan 1 2008 	Not a place to recommend	The Madonna hotel was reserved for us by a travel agent, reputedly a 3* hotel. We arrived late at night (2am) and there were thankfully people awake. Two guys brought our bags up, and stayed in the room until they were tipped. I had only INR 100, but as the porter said, &quot;that is a small tip, 500 is a large tip&quot;.. Well, indeed, 100 is the most i ever tipped in India, and definitely way to much.The rooms were a bit grungy, the bathroom definitely a mess, although the shower was allright (warm water wise). The beds very very hard, and the rooms incredibly noisy. I must say i feel bad for those people trying to sleep when we arrived. Breakfast was included, but they first tried to get us to pay for the breakfast, when i pointed to the fact that it was included, they withdrew the bill. The breakfast we got was not that well, plain toast, en egg, with a lot of water it seemed.Definitely not something i would every recommend to anyone arriving in Delhi.Especially bad marks for the rude, and very tip minded staf. We had left our passports at the reception to copy, the next morning at 7:00 i was woken by the reception on the phone, that they needed our passports (we had arrived at 3 am)..... After reminder that they already had the passports, nothing more was heard."
31,1652,"Dec 19 2007 	no way! overpriced. trip advisor no help with Delhi	no no no. boo.true: this hotel is adequate, kind of...but at 100$ a night, you're paying 3-4x what you would for similar quality in Paharganj. (!)staying here means you burn cash for a decent hotel in a pretty rotten neighborhood.Delhi is tricky -- i've stayed in 8 hotels here at the budget level, and TripAdvisor (which was invaluable in Kyoto and saved my life in Beijing) was useless. LonelyPlanet came a lot closer to helping.You can get a decent room, with some work for 30$ a night in Paharganj, which is more central than the madonna. The madonna staff wasn't particularly friendly -- and when they gave travel advice, you couldn't help feeling like they were scamming you (a pretty constant feeling in delhi, where everything is barter -- it gets old). (The madonna staff was always trying to discourage you from talking to others about your travel needs)Delhi on a budget is tricky -- but it can be done -- and location is pretty important (you won't be spending much time in your hotel room, anyway...) Noise and smell are the two things to be wary of in a delhi hotel room -- the madonna had both. a sweage smell (not as bad as some others i've stayed in) - and the constant din from the street. i've stayed in worse (though for a fifth of the cost! 20$ a night) -- and i've stayed in places where the doors are thin and you can hear the staff talking all night (oddly common experience in Delhi)But buyer beware -- just because TripAd has no reasonable options for delhi (isn't india supposed to be cheap?) doesn't mean they don't exist. Look elsewhere for the deal and the inside info. LonelyPlanet's a good bet."
32,1652,"Dec 19 2007 	Clean 	Stayed at the Hotel Madonna, ideal location to see the real Delhi. It is a clean and safe hotel by Delhi standards and the food was acceptable. The hotel is located near the the metro which is a great service, and at a very low cost, about 10 mins walk from the hotel. Regarding the hotel clean sheets and towels provided every day. Try the marsala omelette which is very tasty also the beer is chilled and very welcome after a day saying no to helpful people!!! who approach you in connaught place . Helpful staff but please have small change when you first arrive as my friend and | both got caught out , a tip of less than 100 rupees is probably more than enough for carrying your bags to the room.Noise is a major factor please bring ear plugs or you will get no sleep. Certainly not a tourist hotel."
33,1652,Nov 20 2007	A decent Delhi hotel	A decent Delhi hotel at a reasonable price. Clean and comfortable. Near the Metro (5-10 minute walk) so accessible to much of Delhi. In a lively neighborhood with shopping opportunities all around. Just two doors down from a fast and inexpensive internet cafe. The staff was helpful but not friendly. Also not particularly attentive: they took my passport when I arrived but failed to return it when I checked out costing me an hour (could have been worse if I hadnt remembered). Breakfasts were good and the one dinner I had was very good.
34,1652,"Aug 18 2007 	New Delhi Experience	Found this hotel through contact at Delhi airport and what a wonderful experience it turned out to be. The rooms were very comfortable and service excellent. We were also able to avail ourselves of the excellent service of Naresh Bhatia in organising a driver toshow us the sights of Delhi and a tour of Agra and Rajasthan for 12 days where his knowledge is second to none through his experience of booking everything including private taxi, knowledgable driver Ramesh and city guides who ensured that we ha athoroughly wonderful time. We then travelled back to Delhi and stayed at Hotel Madonna before going on to Amritsar where yet again the service provided was excellent through organisation of flights and trains including pickups to hotels etc... After this marvellous experience we returned to Madonna to conclude our stay before returning to Goa. We would definitely recommend this hotel and the services of Naresh wishing to have an excellent visit to Delhi and further afield."
35,1652,"Jul 4 2007 	Our Great base in Delhi	At the end of June my partner and I returned from a once in a lifetime trip to India. Our first and final 2 nights were spent in Delhi were we stayed at the Hotel Madonna. As we had been warned it would be difficult to find good hotels in Delhi (not including the luxury ones), we struggled to find an option of hotels in Delhi which we felt comfortable with and within our price range. We finally settled for the Hotel Madonna, which looked okay on the web. Upon arrival, at about 2am in the morning we were warmly welcomed by the night manager and 2 people assisted with our bags. Although we booked a 'Luxury Deluxe' room and were really a bit worried about what to expect , however we were very happy with our room. It was a good size, bright, and most importantly clean. We also had airconditning, fridge and International TV channels. Also in it's favour, we found it convenient travel to all the sites we wanted to see. Staff were always friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. And after we spent 10 days travelling to other parts of India we returned and it was nice to come back to the Madonna for our last 2 days!"
36,1652,"May 26 2007 	Nothing to write home about	We recently stayed at this hotel for 4 seperate nights having made the reservations in advance.The hotel room itself seemed clean and bug free, although the sheets were very stained. The bathroom smelt rather musty, although again itdid look quite clean. Both toilet paper and towels were both in shortsupply, with just one handtowel supplied (on one occassion this clearly hadn't been changed as it was dirty and wet!),On the upside, the owner or manager (I didn't quite catch which) was very helpful and provided us with a map of Delhi, ran through some ofthe key attractions and directed us to the nearby subway. Other staffwere also attentive, ringing to ask if you needed any drinks bringingetc. On the downside, the constant attempts to overcharge room service etcwas very wearing and the cost of taxis booked through the hotel was extortionate (at about 5 times the cost of getting one directlly off the street without any bartering!). If you do stay here check your bills very carefully and use either the nearby subway or taxi rank at the end of the road (out of the hotel and turn left and walk straight to the end of the street) for transport."
37,1652,"May 25 2007 	Didn't like it	We went in expecting the &quot;unexpected&quot; given the mixed reviews, so we brought our own sheets and towels, which came in very handy, as their sheets were dirty and our towels were much better.The hotel in general is clean, the restaurant underground does have an odor and the helpers are very nice. The location is not too bad, 4 blocks away from subway/metro station. Keep in mind that the metro/subway itself doesn't cover much of Delhi.Our experience:Upon arrival, after a 13 hour flight, the front desk guy was very welcoming, already concerned with our next-day plan's.We saw a couple of people walking in with a bottle of mineral water, and we figured we leave everything in the room and go get some of our own. On the way out, again, the receptionist asked about our plans for the next day. We walked just down the street (to the right), which has a beat up sidewalk, which is taken by some vendors anyway, and found a little tour store, which we used for just about everything. Read on for why:The next morning, again same thing, but we were firm and just said we wanted to explore by foot, which is okay, but you can't really get to many monuments by subway/metro (I don't recommend bus). At night, we decided to take a driver from the ever so concerned receptionist to go to dinner, at the Intercontinental, he charged us 400 rupees, to be paid when we checked out.Two problems there, first they way overcharged us, so we used the office listed above, and during check out they tried VERY hard to up that charge even more. So, between spending $65 per night here and $85-$90 at other places close to Connaught Place, don't bother trying to save the extra few bucks.Pictures to come..."
38,1652,"Apr 7 2007 	A very god place to stay in Delhi	A very good hotel in Delhi, with clean rooms,excellent service, friendly and helpful staff. The hotel manager, Mr. Bathia was so friendly top arrange for usn a wo9nderful trip to Agra Pushkar and Jaipur, offering us for the best price hoytels of good standards and also helping us with the transport along all my stay. i can only recomand this hotel to all who will need a stay in Delhi."
39,1652,"Apr 6 2007	Cool decorations but loud with pesky staff	We found this place via their website, which makes it look like a fairly hip, jazzy location. While the exterior decor is in fact cool, Hotel Madonna disappointed on many levels. Overstaffing in India is common (to provide jobs), but every time we came and went, a different guy grabbed each bag - meaning four separate tips. On one instance, I didn't have anything small to tip one of the porters (who was also in charge of delivering toilet paper), so I told him I'd tip him later; guess who ran out of TP?The location is out of the way and the neighborhood is truly India - loud all the time, with plenty of honking to keep you awake at night. Compared to the place we stayed in Bombay (thicker walls), this was like sleeping in a rock concert. The bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom was fairly grungy. They do have an internet connection, but speeds are at 1992 levels. They threw in free breakfast (mediocre) and set up some a driver for the day who repeatedly lied to us and took us to &quot;the only open restaurants&quot; in Delhi until we made him take us to one out of the guidebook that was magically open as well.Bear in mind, we stayed here after three weeks in India, so we were getting pretty sick of the tourist exploitation that goes on there. Still, you can do a lot better than the Hotel Madonna - we did everywhere else we stayed in India."
40,1652,"Mar 30 2007 	My first contact with India.	I was in Delhi last year, my first time in India. I was a little bit afraid going alone but when I arrived at the aerport a guy from the hotel was waiting for me and brought me to the hotel, at that hour and in a strange city very pleasant. The owner, Mr. Pintoo helped me the first days, learned me more about India and what to do and NOT to do. Leaving Delhi, he helped me to reach every place I wanted to visit. The hotel is located near the metro, so very usefull to see the city. I'm going back in a few months, can't wait!Bernard"
41,1652,"Mar 27 2007 	A wonderful place to stay in Delhi	One year ago I was taled about the hotel, last year I came to Delhi and stayed in this hotle. The hotel hostility was really wonderful and I decided to come back with my wife. So this time I came with my wife and Mr. Pitoo arrange a womderful trip to Jaipur and Agra and really my wife and I enjoyed our stay. The hotle is locted colesed to the market place and suitable to go for site seeing. The evey important thing about this hotle is that it's very clean and the staff are so kind to the guests.Thank you so much for evey thing, India will be our second home after Ethiopia."
42,1652,"Mar 4 2007 	Not bad	Delhi is a pretty hard place to get accomodations under $100 that are reasonable. Considering this, Hotel Madonna is not so bad, at $81 including taxes and breakfast. They were honest with us, and the manager (Naresh) was very good at making reasonably-priced car and travel arrangements for us. The area is also nice, as there aren't many tourists around to attract touts &amp; beggars, and there are plenty of ATMs and shops (bottled water, cell phone SIM cards, etc...). They picked us up from the airport as arranged, even though our flight was delayed by 6 hours and arrived at 4 AM.The downsides? Not the cleanest hotel we ever stayed in. Street noise can be very loud (Indian street noise is a whole different level than the west...). We had to call reception every day for towels and more toilet paper. Restaurant is best avoided."
43,1652,"Feb 28 2007 	Do not stay here!	Everything started out OK - phoned the hotel ahead of time, got a rate in USD ($92) and arranged a hotel pick-up, which was there when I arrived. The people were nice enough, but I got the sense that they would try to deceive me. Sure enough, at check-out time, they attempted to overcharge me. Once I pointed out the mistake, they quickly rectified it.The breakfast is included, but nothing special. The dining room is subterranean and smelly. The room was clean, but very basic, and my bathroom had a direct opening to the outside and during the night when I got up to use the bathroom, there was a *bird* inside my bathroom - nearly scared the life out of me!There is a dearth of good midrange hotel rooms in Delhi. Try the India Habitat Centre if you can find someone with a membership.This hotel is not up to western standards, and should be avoided if at all possible."
44,1652,"Feb 20 2007	Good value modern hotel	Having read a number of reviews of Delhi hotels all had some negative aspect, be it dated rooms, moody staff, poor location or poor value. The tripadvisor reviews for this hotel seemed okay so we booked this for 4 nights via internet.Other than being an autorickshaw ride away from the centre (3-4km) and with no real restaurant alternative in the imediate vicinity we were very pleased with the hotel, the rooms were clean and well equiped with modern matching furniture, everything worked including the tv reception which was a first for India in several weeks of traveling. The hotel has a small restaurant and the food is okay and reasonably priced. Also the hotel was 500R+ cheaper than poorer sounding alternatives in Connaught Place.Overall we were happy with the hotel, the money saved more than covered the costs of autorickshaws into town. Also Karol Bagh market area, wih indian and western restaurants, is only 10 minutes walk, as is the metro station that provides a pleasant alternative to bargaining fares with rickshaw drivers and gives direct access to Red Fort, New Delhi Station and Connaught Place."
45,1652,Feb 20 2007	cheap budget hotel	The hotel was good but the restaurant was of poor standard every time you entered it smelt really bad; hygine was not of top of the list. However tour organiser was good and we enjoyed the tour. our room was clean but basic. If you do visit delhi be aware of profit making scandles your guide and taxi driver are usually in to make some money.We came across this when our guide would not let us go where we wanted to go and kept taking us places he wanted and forcing us to buy things that we did not want buy.
46,1652,"Feb 7 2007	Very good mid-range option	Service was excellent and the owner, Naresh, was very helpful. Very good in this rare mid-range category in Delhi. The location is by Karol Bagh station, which is convenient to get to various places (Old Delhi, Connaught Pl., etc.). Room was very clean, but if you can you should try and get a room in the back as there is noise on the rooms facing the street (also I was on the first floor)."
47,1652,"Jan 15 2007 	decent mid range option	There is a lack of mid-range hotels in India, there seems to be only $20-$25 hotels and $200-$250 hotels. The Madonna is a fair attempt at a mid range option. Pleasant enough rooms, free (but slooow) Internet, complementary breakfast and the possibility of walking to a metro station are all positives. The hotel is under the same ownership as one 100m away which has a Sheraton type name (but is not part of the Intl group). The staff were friendly and helpful when I was unable to print out my Expedia voucher as I had made an error entering my email address. You get the same rather hard bed that I found elsewhere around Delhi. I was there in a cold spell in early January and the room was cold, the lack of a heater, the draught from the windows and intermittent hot water in the shower meant something of a cold welcome. However heat rather than cold would be the issue for most of the year."

1,1653,"Nov 26 2009 	Not Good	Stayed here for a total of three nights and didn't really have much say on where I stayed as it was booked as part of a package. I couldn't agree more with the second to last reviewer especially with regard to the moth ballsThe bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a bit of a safety hazard. The toilet had one of those &quot;sanitized for you convenience&quot; labels on it which was a joke as it was not clean. The shower curtain was filthy. The rest of the room was adequate but I didn't feel it was all that clean.Breakfast was OK.With regards to the new wing mentioned by the previous reviewer, I don't think this is being marketed as part of the Mehar as it looks from the photos in a completely different league.I would chose not to stay here in the future."
2,1653,"Nov 18 2009 	Thumbs up	I was fortunate to be the very first customer of a new hotel wing associated with the Mehar Castle Hotel (same owner and overlapping management), just starting to operate as the JP Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel in mid-Nov 09 (web page yet to come). The location is just adjacent to the Mehar Castle, on a side street near Ghaffar Market of Amjal Khan Road, in Karol Bagh. I can only recommend this hotel, which is all new, with relatively generous, classy, ensuite rooms, tiled flooring and modern style furniture with latest appliances (a/c, TV, ceiling fan, fridge, safety lockers, etc), neat bathrooms etc. It also features a small dining room for customer use and is a very quiet hotel away from street noise. I would rate the room comfort as 3.5-4 stars, with reasonable cost (Rs2,500-3,500 range inc. pick-up and breakfast). The down sides? No power point by the desk (eg. for computer), no outside windows (the price of a quiet room) and small lobby space. Room decoration was also yet to come. The new hotel staff have been very helpful and efficient, being proud of inaugurating their small new 5 room hotel wing - the food: so far, so very good. So thumbs up from me !"
3,1653,"Nov 3 2009 	sets the bar low	I'm not one to complain much, but as my first hotel in India, this really set the bar low, even though I wasn't expecting a lot. From the green slime covering the shower head, to the rot in the corners of the bathtub, to the mothballs scattered throughout the room, to the infernally noisy air conditioner...i don't know where to start. I'll start with the dead bugs i was picking out of my bed before i went to bed. And the noise that woke me up at 6am...it was daily street noise that felt like it was just on the other side of thin walls. Or maybe I'll start with the bed that felt like a plank of wood covered with a thin blanket? The cold shower is not something i would complain about since I didn't get it at 8 of the 9 hotels I stayed at. The area around the hotel is in the main shopping area of Karol Bagh. It's not the safest area to start out in, but you can get good bargains, and it's close to the metro. They offer free internet but it's really slow. The phone in the room is on a rotary dial system. On the bright side, the room was large, the hard bed turned out to be relatively comfortable, and room service was attentive, if not on the annoying side."
4,1653,"Oct 22 2009 	an excellent location for stay..	Hotel provides good hospitality..we were provided with a family room which had two double beds..which was perfect for my wife and my two children. Good service,good food.."
5,1653,"Jan 24 2008 	A fairly decent hotel	My wife and I stayed in Room # 208 (Double Deluxe Room at INR 1690/night, as advertised on their web site).Location: within about 5 minutes' walk to Karol Bagh metro station. Plenty of street shops and vendors in the daytime.Quite a spacious room with sitting area, marble floors. Not spotlessly clean maybe, but quite decent. Hard mattresses, aircon working but wouldn't set to heating, though staff provided additional blankets on request. Still, as the draught was coming through the window we had to move our bed to the middle of the room every night and back every morning. Noise protection next to non-existent, so all door bangs and loud conversations in the corridor are heard very clearly, and so is the work in the street.No reading lights.Bathroom has definitely seen better days. There was hot water in the shower, though the pressure was barely adequate.Good staff. Excellent food  probably the best vegetable fried rice we had during our two-week trip."
1,1657,Nov 15 2009 	My Stay in Delhi	Booked via Makemytrip. Hotel is average. Location is midst of Karol bagh the populated area of Old Delhi. Close to many places though. We stayed here as we needed to visit US Consulate for an Interview. Room was very good though no balcony. AC was good. Had a problem with the bathroom lock. Got locked out from inside. Bathroom has new jacuuzi but it was not that effective and was malfunctioning. Room service was very good. Got value for money to some extent. TV was good. Was an LCD. Would recommend.
2,1657,"Apr 30 2008 	oh ma gosh ...plz never stay here	i went to Delhi for a tour with my family consisting of 3 members.we had actually booked rooms in an other hotel but we reached late at nite coz of the big traffic block in delhi .the other hotel people said that the room was not available at nite and that they have arranged room in a nearby hotel i.e; omni .we agreed and when we reached there the chechk in counters we gud but the room were just horrible ...it was very small and very conjusted ..we could hardly move around ...the bed spread , linens etc were so untidy and had a foul smell ..now to talk bout the bathrooms i better dont say anything .it was so untidy and i think it hadn't been cleaned for an year . the rooms were so dark and we couldnt differentiate between nite and day . it was such a horrible experience . the services were ok . next day we were shifted to the hotel which we had booked(not omni) . thank god i was shifted . the other hotel was gud .but i wud say to everybody that never go and stay in this hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,1657,Feb 5 2008 	Omni hotel did not honor reservation	I reserved a superior room for one night through the Venere travel agency.(They had all my credit card information) When I arrived at the hotel at 2:00A.M.after the 20 hour trip from New York City I was told the hotel was filled and could not stay there.I was offered a room at another hotel which I declined. My voucher for the room for the night was deemed meaningless. An Iranian Tour operator was also having a problem with arrangements that had been made months before. A reservation at the hotel might be honored if no one else takes your room before you arrive.I would warn you against staying at a hotel run by such shabby people.
4,1657,"Jan 14 2008 	Not a hotel but a hole	I'm working in India for a couple of weeks and decided to visit Delhi. BCDTravel from India booked the hotel. The place is just terrible. The area in where it is is awful, you feel like you're going to get killed the moment you put a feet outside the hotel (I know in general the zones in India don't look good, but really this is one of the worst areas there). The rooms are very dirty, smells, i even found 10 empty bottles of beer in front of my room when i arrived (no one worried to at least throw them at that moment) and also when o left the next day. Don't follow the tramp of the pictures, they must be edited because it's not like the pictures at all. The rate for a hotel like this should be less than US$10, not more."
5,1657,Sep 13 2007 	value for money	i booked my hotel from the website and i made the payment from ther and i wa scared that the hotel is good enough or not but when i reached the airport i was welcomed like a person of my family has came to recive me and it was of a different class and when i reached the hotel it was like i have paid nothing for the hotel ppl say that that it is value for money but i will say it was more than value for money one difficulty i experienced that was i was that tv cabel was not working for 2 hour or so but later it was corrected so i will recamend each and everybody to visit this hotel and the hotel website is [--]
6,1657,"Aug 19 2007 	No I don't want to go to Agra.	I am used to staying at inexpensive Indian hotels as well as Western style hotels in India. Usually, the Indian hotels above a certain price range (like more than US$15/night) are fine with some shabbiness in the facilities. Other than the bathroom, my room was clean and comfortable, and even the bathroom was okay if not spotless. They provided a kettle and some instant coffee/tea too (although the mug was dirty with dried coffee inside.) The hotel has free (!) wireless Internet, a real convenience. But I would never stay here again because it's pretty clear it's a scam for the travel agency that owns/is partnered with it.I should have known when I arrived this place was into fleecing people. I tipped the guy who carried my bags. Later, he hunted me down because the bill was 'ripped'. I know that India has this wierd thing about bills not being legal tender if they are ripped, but there's apparently some exchange process where you take the old bill to a bank and they'll replace it, and this bill was ancient, but intact--not actually ripped. I'm 90% sure this guy brought the bill back because he thought he deserved a bigger tip, and of course since I didn't have any other small bills of the same denomination, I did give him a bigger tip. I wouldn't do that now.Can I just say, I am sooooo sick of the following sequence of questions:1. Sir, where are you from? What is your good name? 2. How long are you in staying in Delhi? (answer, 2 days)3. Have you ever been to India? (yes, 5 times)4. What are you doing today? (ummm, some work, maybe going to visit some friends)5. Would you like a package tour to the Taj Mahal in Agra? (or the more forceful 'you *would* like a package tour to the Taj Mahal.') And usually a refusal to take no for an answer.I was asked _seven_ times to go to the Taj by the hotel staff--desk clerks, bellhop, including one extended conversation in which they claimed there was some problem with my hotels.com reservation, then took me to a travel agency a block away to have them 'check my reservation' and 'give feedback to the management' and three guys took turns trying to sell me tours. The next day I get an unscheduled wakeup call. I'm dead asleep, a call to the room wakes me up, and he asks about my 'hotel voucher,' &quot;I gave you the reservation sheet yesterday&quot;, &quot;What are you doing today?&quot;, &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;, &quot;You should go to Agra today&quot;, I slam down the phone. Even just leaving the hotel, the desk clerk stops me, asks my room number, then interrogates me about my plans again (same guy as that morning on the phone? I don't know). I'm used to touts. But the hotel staff honestly seem to think I owe them a booking on some overpriced tour. It's like one of those condo timeshare sales pitches that lasts your entire stay in the hotel. Never again will I stay here!Checking out was more of the same. Again with the upselling. So first they get all huffy, and they're like &quot;you have to pay at check out!&quot; Um, yes, I normally expect that at a hotel. But again they are frustrated because my 'voucher' is not a voucher, but a reservation through hotels.com (not prepaid, in this case.) Okay, so I try to pay. Despite the lovely lucite stand sitting on the check in desk saying &quot;We accept visa/master/american express&quot; they refuse to take my card. &quot;Well we don't take cards for such a small amount.&quot; Yeah, like $80 is too small an amount to charge--in India, where I've seen merchants set minimum charge amounts near $2. And it's not like it's some old decal stuck in a place where it can't be removed, or some sponsored sign that has other information on it. It's a brand new sign sitting on the desk that says only that they take the credit cards. Okay, I'll pay cash. Then they refuse to give me a receipt. And the reason? Because they say my internet reservation is my receipt! I just hand this guy a wad of cash, and he's telling me the same piece of paper I had before I paid is now proof of payment. I pushed the issue and got upset, and refused to leave until I had a receipt (fearing that they would then charge my credit card used in the reservation as well and claim they'd never received the cash.) Again with the trip to the travel agency around the corner to speak to the 'management'. He says 'we'll have to charge you more if you get a receipt. We have to include luxury tax then.' and I say 'and you would have cheated the government of the tax otherwise?' The guy says again and again, &quot;we are very honest, how would we stay in business otherwise?&quot; Right after admitting to me he's stealing from the public coffers. And again with the upselling. &quot;Where are you going now? You should just hire a car for the day, only 1100 rupees.&quot; In the end the ride to the airport cost me 500, even though my Indian friend had taken the same ride, also booked through the hotel, the previous day for 350. As I'm getting into the car, the hotel guy says 'well it's 500 for the ride, but 600 if you want A/C'. Well fine then, I don't want A/C. I spend half the ride arguing. Driver tries to sell me on how great the A/C is, then he tries to pull the &quot;I am but a humble servant, and it's so hot, won't you please pay for A/C? Please sir! Please!&quot; I know full well he's getting 150% of the real fare, and I'm not gonna pay him one paisa more on the bait and switch. I tell him if he wants the A/C so badly he should pay the 100 rupees (and he'd still be making more than normal off me!). At this point it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing with the hidden charges etc. I've had to yell at three people from the hotel just to get them to leave me alone. And in approximately 5 months of traveling in India over a period of several years, I've had to resort to yelling when someone just wouldn't take no for an answer only twice before this hotel--once with a beggar who tried to stop me from walking down the sidewalk by blocking my path for about 10 minutes straight, and once with a dishonest internet cafe host.Please, please don't even bother trying this hotel. Karol Bagh is full of comparable hotels at generally lower prices that don't come with a fulltime harrassment program."
7,1657,"Dec 26 2006 	Hotel Omni is not a hotel	I got hotel booked from my indian partners &amp; this is the worst hotel I've every stayed in! I happened to stay here last month &amp; everything from the service to the rooms were just terrible. The first thing you'll notice would be the smell of damp linen... everything from the bed sheets to pillows stunk with the smell. Check In system was horrible . I left the next morning since it was late in the night and staying in a neighbouring much cheaper, but much cleaner and nicer hotel! I didn't get enough time in India to be able to get the hotel closed, but if I ever do this is the first thing I would do!"
8,1657,Dec 9 2006	Feel like 5 star hotel. Excellent place to live!	Stayed there for a week. Great service. Awesome staff! Rooms are 5 star standard. Definitely you will get value for money to stay here. I will strongly recommend.
1,1658,Good but noisy	We stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception. All the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard in our room all night. Also there were some cat fights under the window providing more noise. Try to get a room far away from the reception and/or wear earplugs.Eevrything else worked OK.
2,1658,"Nov 20 2009 	Good Place to Stay	This hotel is fairly small but well sited in the middle of Delhi in Connaught Place. Rooms are variable in size but well appointed for us.Staff areexcellent and very helpful, whilst the attached restaurant has excellent food and service.Connaught Place itself is undergoing extensive restoration, so there is quite a bit of mess in the area.Only trouble with the hotel is that is no lounge area for friends to meet, but you can use the restaurant for this purpose without difficulty."
3,1658,"Nov 19 2009 	Centrally located clean and with a good restaurant	As with other reviews the driver was unsure exactly where this hotel was on Connaught Circus. I recognised it as It looked exactly like the pictures on tripadvisor. Greeting was pleasant, room was small but clean and well appointed. Restaurant was excellent. Location was so central for that part of Delhi with plenty of shops, clubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk.There was some noise, perhaps from the cinema, but it wasn't unbearable. I'd definitely stay here again.By the way don't think about visiting the (fairly nearby) Indian Coffee House - what a dump!"
4,1658,"Nov 15 2009 	Clean rooms great service good location and value	The staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean. It was also quiet which was great as it was daylight when we finally got to sleep, due to jet lag, yet we didn't hear any of the usual daytime traffic noise. The hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week while we visited some cities in Rajastan. Overall, a very enjoyable stay at a great price - Don't be put off by the exterior, it's great inside."
5,1658,"Nov 13 2009 	Took our money and left us stranded on the streets of delhi at night!	My husband and I have traveled widely around India, yet nothing prepared us for the predicament we faced when we booked in to this hotel! Having consulted TripAdvisor and seen the high rating of Hotel Palace Heights we clicked on the booking which led us to hotels.com (expedia.in) through which we booked this hotel for 2 nights. Our booking confirmation from hotels .com came through and my husband's credit card was charged the full amount. We took a print out of the confirmation and having travelled via train from shimla we arrived at new delhi at 10 pm at night to be met with bewilderment at the front desk of the hotel palace heights! They saw our booking confirmation and said that they had not received any booking and that they had no rooms available for us. Without any apology they said that it must have been hotels.com's fault as they had NOT RECEIVED ANY BOOKING! We being visitors to Delhi did not know what to do next. Attempts to reach hotel.com at that hour failed so we were left in a dilemma as to where to spend the night. We eventually did manage to find an overpriced and badly located hotel later that night but our trip had been ruined by our experience.Hotel.com say its the hotels's fault and they have our money which HAS NOT YET BEEN refunded nearly three weeks after the incident! To sum it up : THIS HOTEL IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL BUT UNTRUSTWORTHY and brings this website's recommendations into disrepute. Be warned that if you book this hotel through this site you too may end up in our predicament, having to pay for a room that you are unable to stay in and with weeks of trouble trying to reclaim the money in vain."
6,1658,"Nov 3 2009 	Excellent Value	I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. It was difficult for my taxi driver to find the hotel, and from the outside it doesn't look that great, but the rooms inside are great, with a modern and clean decor, flat panel TV, and a lovely bathroom. They're not huge rooms, but they're very comfortable. The location is perfectly central, there are loads of shops, restaurants, and ATMs when you step out of the hotel. All the staff, from reception to housekeeping, are very courteous and helpful. The food in the restaurant, Zaffran, is wonderful, and the service in there is also exemplary. There is also complimentary water, fruit and internet, and a welcome juice. I would rate this as higher than a 3 star. Also, just a note -- I ate all the fresh fruit provided in the room and got more when i finished. It was good to eat fruit that i could trust."
7,1658,"Oct 31 2009 	Nice Place for tourists/night stay.	I visited Delhi as a tourist with my spouse and young kids. I didn't want to pay a very high price just for the few nights stay in a typical 5 star hotels, so I chose this hotel based on other reviews. All we needed a night stay in a safe, clean and comfortable place. Although little higher on the price side for what it offers (not very big, but ok size rooms). Location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate. Most site seeing locations are closer to this place and central park, Metro station is right there. Restaurant is also fabulous. Overall very nice experience and would recommend with high ratings. Free wireless Internet service. For vehicles, Parking on the streets, free of charge but not very difficult to find."

The room we had was clean and we were able to sleep 3 in the room. it is an expensive hotel, but worth it for the restaurant and its central position. The staff were extremely helpful, even to the extent of accompnaying us to find an ATM which worked."
9,1658,"Oct 26 2009 	Excellent Good Value Down Town Hotel	Great location right in the heart of Connaught Place and close to the metro station. (Beware though, that because the hotel is quite small and with no street frontage to speak of, taxi drivers may not know where it is).The two best things about this hotel were the restaurant - great at both breakfast and dinner (some of the best food I've ever had in India) - and the enthusiasm of the staff and their willingness to help with everything.Rooms are well appointed and confortable. althougha bit on the small side. The AC can be a bit aggressive and in our room we were forced to turning it off during the night so as to avoid being too cold. However, that's a minor niggle.Internet worked fine and was reasonably fast.The only negative aspect was that having booked another couple of nights for the following week, we were informed the evening before we left that they were unable to honour these extra nights. Had I not gone to the desk to book a taxi for the following morning, I suspect that I wouldn't have found this out until too late.Good value for Delhi. Overall, recommended."
10,1658,"Oct 25 2009 	Clean modern hotel	We stayed for 3 nights in late June and then for one night in early July on our way back home. The hotel was modern and very clean. The AC worked very well and it was a good escape from the very hot temps outside. Rooms were on the small side and there isn't much of a lobby, so if you wanted to sit around/linger this isn't really the place to do that. Our first room faced an interior air shaft/courtyard but the second one faced a side street. Staff was friendly and helpful and we met the owner one night who was also very pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast is included and there were both western (eggs, pancakes) options and Indian options. There isn't much to see in Connaught Place, but there are many restaurants in walking distance. It was strange to walk out on our first night for dinner and be one of the few people in the street in what is considered the center of town. The hotel arranged a car to pick us up at the hotel and the driver (Bobby) was nice but tried to sell us on his tour guide services the entire ride to the hotel. He even tried to take us to his office BEFORE dropping us off at the hotel, but we politely declined saying that after such a long trip we just wanted to get to the hotel and shower/sleep. This worked and he took us to the hotel. Because he was so friendly and seemed like a good guide we hired him to drive us around on a tour of Delhi a couple of days later and he barely spoke throughout the entire day that we spent with him. It seems he used all of his Delhi facts to get us to book with him and once we did he didn't have much more to say. His company seems to work exclusively with Hotel Palace Heights, so beware when booking tours through the hotel. He was nice and honest, but didn't offer much in way of a tour. Overall, the hotel experience was a good one. If what you're looking for is a modern, clean and safe hotel in the &quot;center&quot; of Delhi, then you can't go wrong with Hotel Palace Heights."
11,1658,"Sep 1 2009 	perfect service	I stayed end of august (29.08.09) in this hotel in Delhi - and it was simply perfect!!! You can't ask for a nicer, welcoming service. Everybody from the staff was very friendly and tried to help in every way - from access to internet, to phoning at the agency where I've had booked an ac-cab for a sight seeing tour that didn't show up. The receptionist made it come in less than 5 minutes 8after I've waited half an hour in vain). M. Wasim at the reception desk was extremely kind, and also his colleague who was on duty after his shift.I only can recommend this hotel. Connaught place is in the very heart of Delhi, the rooms are comfortable, have European standard, what a pleasure to find a nice and clean bathroom after a travel through the Himalayas. a welcome drink (juice, of course it's India after all) was offered as well as a fruit basket. It was simply perfect."
12,1658,"Aug 24 2009 	Definitively my favorite place in Norther India!	I stayed in India three weeks visiting Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Mumbay. I spent two nights at Palace Heights at the beginning of my trip and two at the end. The staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and efficient, making you feeling at home (if not even better!). The service is professional, discrete and very efficient. They arrange perfect tours and transfers from/to the airport. The hotel is a quiet oasis in the heart of Delhi, with clean rooms furnished in a contemporary design style. The restaurant is one of the best I tried in India, cozy and relaxing. You buy a five star quality hotel at the price of a three star! A modern and confortable hotel with a strong personality!"
13,1658,"Jul 12 2009 	Expensive/Annoying for the price	We could hear incessant banging in the first TWO rooms they put us in. After finally getting settled into a quiet room, we put on the do not disturb sign, but people kept calling and knocking on the door to give us things like cookies - nice, but annoying. They also pressured us into using their travel agent for a tour to the Taj Mahal. The car and driver was over priced and had barely working A/C. The driver didn't really talk to us (for the 2 hour there and 3 hour back drive) and kept making us go places to buy stuff (we didn't but he stopped anyway). The car didn't have seat belts. The staff at the hotel also told us differing info on how much things were going to cost and Monday through Friday the electricity goes on and off every so often."
14,1658,"Jun 9 2009 	Nice but expensive hotel	We stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height. The hotel is expensive for the size of the room &amp; bathroom we had. The view from the hotel room is not great.. On our first night we had no hot water, but the hotel staff fixed that problem very quickly. However the hotel staff are courteous and provided a good service.If you are in Delhi for a couple of days and want to be in a good location to the attraction, this hotel will be fine."
15,1658,"Jun 4 2009 	Excellent service	I've stayed at this hotel a number of times so far - always for business - and the one thing that stands out is the customer service, and he staff's desire to please.The hotel is small, but very well kept, and clean. The wireless internet used to be problem, but they have fixed it. The food in Zaffran is excellent... the breakfast is to order, and always prepared very well. They cater to a lot of foreign tourists.The location of the hotel is superb. Right above the Metro station which makes traveling around Delhi a breeze. Its also in the heart of Connaught Place (CP) with plenty of options in shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and great to walk around in the evenings when traffic is a lighter.I've always had a pleasant experience at the hotel, and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, safe, and good place to stay. It is a little pricey, and I think would be better valued at about $25-30 below its current rates."
16,1658,"May 20 2009 	take your chances	We stayed here on two separate occassions. We landed in Delhi and stayed the night before leaving elsewhere. Our first night was awesome. The room was small, but adequate. It was nicely decorated and clean. No complaints. When we returned a few days later it was a different story. Our room was even smaller than the first night. We were given dirty towels and bed sheets. The walls were scuffed and dirty. The thermostat control was so filthy it was black. When we complained, the staff apologized,but that was about it. It was hard to believe this was the same hotel.It wasn't cheap either. We paid $183.00 Cdn through Expedia, not good value for the money. We paid for a hotel transfer and didn't get one, nor did we get a refund. The outside of the hotel looks very rough, but once inside it is nicely decorated. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Zaffron offers great value for the money. The food and service was one of the best we had in India."
17,1658,"Apr 30 2009 	A good staritng point	The service here was excellent, particularly in the restaurant. The rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower. Rooms are a bit small with no view, but are kept very clean, with clean linen every day. Complimentary fruit, water and snacks are provided It was relatively expensive compared to the rest of India, but worth it for Delhi. Breakfast is included with the rate and has a good choice and a decent buffet. The food in the restaurant was one of the best Indian restaurants we visited and very good value"
18,1658,"Apr 29 2009 	Good hotel conveniently located on Connaught Place	Well located on Connaught Place and for getting a tuk tuk to the varying sites of Delhi. The hotel is better than an 'average 3*' rating but not good enough for a ' very good 4*' rating. The service was good and the rooms are clean, if a little on the small side. However, if you are only in Delhi for a day and a night (which we were) then it does exactly what you want. The restaurant (attached to the hotel) called Zaffran was very good."
19,1658,"Apr 23 2009 	Excellent and well priced hotel right in the thick of it!	This was the third hotel we stayed in during our to-ing and fro-ing to Delhi. It was the cheapest (98 per room per night inc breakfast), the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lot!The staff were great and very helpful. The room was lovely, clean and well equipped. Best of all was the restaurant and the central position. The breakfast was excellent and we ate at the restaurant too on our last night in India, which was reasonably priced and one of the best meals we had during our trip. The location couldn't be better - walk out of the door and you're right in the middle of the intensity that is Connaught place! But inside it's calm and a haven. If you've only got a few nights in Delhi - stay here."
20,1658,"Apr 20 2009 	Perfect Boutique Hotel	If you are lookin for a hotel in Delhi which is centrally located, affordable, convinient then Palace Heights is the place to stay. The hotel is located on the inner circle of connaught place and is on the second floor. The approach kind of looks deceptive but once you enter the premises i bet you are heading for a good experience. Its a small property having 15-18 rooms only. There is a restaurant called Zafran which serves great Indian food and is also a popular among the locals. Complimentry morning breakfast is served here too. Being a small property you can be assured of personalised service. The staff right from the doorman at the entrance to the hotel manager are friendly and ever welcoming. The rooms are small but cant expect anything grand at that price (rs.6000 - 7000) in that part of the city. The room decor is modern and the bathrooms are done up well too. Its a great place for tourists who are lookin out for affordable accomodation, central location, not looking for aminities just wanting to sleep the night in good rooms eat good breakfat and get out to spend the day. Applies for business travellers as well."
21,1658,"Apr 19 2009 	An individual hotel with personal service	We stayed for two nights at the palace heights and would definately recommend it. The room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect, if a little small. The location is great for getting a feel for Dehli although I would warn you not to stray too far off the beaten track but this goes for everywhere in Dehli. The restaurant is excellent at a reasonable price. I know we could have eaten cheaper but for under ten pounds for more than the two of us could eat seemed a good deal to us especially as it was so good. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would go back again, in fact we did go back to the restaurant on our last night in India having unfortunately booked another hotel which wasn't nearly as good."
22,1658,"Apr 18 2009 	Great in all respects	The well located Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis . The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out . They are well deocrated and all the things that you would expect from a good hotel have been considered such as good room service , wireless and various complimentary touches . The staff are exceptional and the service was excellent and attentive in all respects .The restaurant is also great and serves fanatastic food from North India , once again the service was great and the restaurant manager was particularly helpful in recommending dishes .Highly recommended"
23,1658,"Apr 10 2009	Fantastic hotel in a central location	The hotel is small but great, in a very central location in Delhi. The rooms were fantastic, I can't fault anything wrong with the rooms. The hotel restaurant was also great - I highly recommend it."
24,1658,"Apr 6 2009 	Don't judge a book by it's cover	Arriving at Connaught Place, Delhi is an experience in itself. Oh my goodness, the driving is like nothing on earth I have ever seen before. Cars, people, bicycles, tuk-tuks and anything goes.From outside the hotel looks small and unassuming but once inside its cool air-conditioned loveliness all your travel stresses disappear. The Reception staff are very helpful and their english is excellent. We had arrived in India with only 3 of our 21 nights with a hotel booking, the hotel staff recommended a travel agent - Perfect Holidays, and a very helpful man, Javid organised the next 8 nights for us including internal flights, accommodation and a driver.The room was a little on the small side but very clean as was the bathroom with all the usual trimmings - extra loo roll, shower cap etc.The hotel is in a great location, smack bang in the middle of the shopping area and close to the underground Palika market. Breakfast in the Restaurant was lovely - choice of indian, continental or english. This was one of the better hotels we stayed in on our trip."
25,1658,"Mar 30 2009 	Fab fab fab fab!!!	This was my second stay at palace heights, and it was just as great as the first one! This is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at, everytime you visit delhi. They have an excellent restaurant attached, and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food, this is truly authentic. Their room service is even more fab, with meals reaching in 10mins! The rooms althou small are immaculately maintained and any troubles you may have are dealt with immediately. The staff, right from their manager to the various service attendants are so polite, its ridiculous. I have stayed at various hotels all over India and none have been this wonderful an experience. Literally, one can make no complaints. Its the perfect Boutique hotel. Only thing missing is possibly a spa, just to wrap the deal!Will definitely keep staying at Palace heights, everytime I do visit Delhi."
26,1658,"Mar 21 2009 	Highly recommended - comfortable rooms with modern flair good food!	Situated on Connaucht Place. Spacious bedroom and bathroom. Furnishings all-round elegant and in very good condition. Amenities: Airconditioning functioned well, safe, upon arrival complementary fruit basket (1 apple, 1 orange, 2 bananas, 2 chocolate biscuits) and daily two large bottles of water, facilities to make tea or coffee, free daily newspaper. We like Indian food as authentic as possible, i.e. spicy and hot. Hotel Restaurant Zaffran satisfied both criteria. In fact, the food was absolutely delicious, delicately spiced, and not too hot. Two main dishes plus two portions of Naan bread and a bottle of water average cost between 775 and 900 Rupee. Although the breakfast buffet was rather simple, the food was good. The usual cereals, two kinds of fruit, bread, butter, jam and honey. Orders for eggs, bacon/sausages/ham, toast, coffee or tee are taken by a waiter. The coffee was absolutely fantastic! Each cup prepared separately with freshly ground coffee beans. The hotel &amp; restaurant staff was competent, very friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel."
27,1658,"Mar 15 2009 	Great service location breakfast and value for money!	We only booked a day room at the Palace Heights at the end of our trip after arriving by sleeper train at 9:15 am and before flying home that night, but we would have no hesitation in using it for our entire stay in Delhi on our next visit. We had a smooth and speedy check-in, and being ravenous, as we had not eaten on the train that morning, went straight into breakfast which was delicious, especially the pancakes and capuccino! Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with a kettle and tea/coffee, the shower gave ample hot water and there were lovely toiletries. The hotel is on the first floor (there is a lift) which means the rooms are quiet, and its location on Connaught Square is excellent - we loved the great bookshop 2 blocks away. Best of all, however is the service: from the doorman downstairs who loaded our luggage into the lift and whisked us up to reception, to the smiling receptionist and waiters in the restaurant - nothing was too much trouble, and every member of staff was eager to please. I can highly recommend the Palace Heights as great value for money."
28,1658,"Feb 27 2009 	The Best Ever ! Will be back for more	I'm so glad that I had chance to stay in Palace Heights.I was traveling alone to Delhi for architecture conference. I'm a woman and Delhi's first timer.I did my 'research' on tripadvisor and decided to choose 3 hotels for my stays: Ginger Hotel, Hans Hotel and Palace Heights.I had a good hunch with Palace Heights, since my first email conversation with their general manager, Mr. Joseph. He responded to my email and made me sure that my reservation is secured. Palace Heights is such a high demand hotel among travelers and I can see why during my stay.I loved the building and its settings. Palace Heights is an example of successful adaptive re-used building. The location is just perfect, in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia.I loved the hotel room - minimalist, simple and very clean. I loved the window which facing to CP and you can witness the bustling busy experience downstairs. And the goof thing is the room is very quite - you can't hear anything from outside.But the thing I loved more is the superb service and warm greetings ! From receptionist to restaurant, from housekeeper to general manager! They are doing their best to help me and make sure my stay is incredible. And they did.I'm really impressed when I asked their help whether I can print my essays for my presentation at the conference. They don't have business center. So what they did was, they take me to hotel's main office, which located couple blocks from the hotel. And they insist to take me by hotel's car. After I print everything, the car drove me back to hotel.The porter always accompanied me when I want to take a tuk tuk and made sure that the driver know where I want to go and bargain the price for me. And for the bonus - they have a free wifi !I'm so blessed with all kindness I accepted during my stay and I will be back for more Palace heights experience."
29,1658,"Feb 10 2009 	High Standards at a reasonable price	Arrived from London, our pick up (arranged through the hotel) was waiting for us. The hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi, a short walk from shops and parks and the Metro is very close by. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are very clean and modern. The restaurant is excellent. The only negative points were: 1. We specifically booked twin beds (travelling with my daughter) and when we arrived this was not available. The first night they found us another room, on the second (a week later) they provided a Collapsible bed but this was quite uncomfortable. Unfortunately the same problem occurred wherever we stayed during the trip. 2. The second minor problem was the surging shower with fluctuating water temperature (not extreme so merely annoying)."
30,1658,"Jan 31 2009 	A great respite from the bustle of New Delhi	The location is fantastic, the Palace Heights give you an oasis of calm right in the middle of Connaught Place.The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, with good recommendations for restaurants in the area, since no matter how the the hotel restaurant is (and it it good) -- you can't eat there every night.The included fruits, water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily with no hassle.I had also arranged airport pickup through the hotel and everything went very smoothly: driver was there on time, very professional etc.."
31,1658,"Jan 5 2009 	A Haven of Peace	My husband and I stayed at the Palace Heights at the start of our Indian holiday in November. We had arranged an airport pick up with them which sadly wasn't there when we landed. We called the hotel who immediately got a driver to us so we were not really delayed. On arrival (given that this was 6 in the morning) they got us a welcome drink and told us our room would be ready in 20 minutes. This was a real bonus as it meant we could have a sleep before hitting Delhi.Throughout our stay the staff were really helpful. Changing money for smaller notes, booking cars etc.Each day we had complimentary water and fresh fruit. The hotel was a real haven away from the bustle of Connaught Place and the food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent."
32,1658,"Dec 31 2008 	Good location tidy and professional staff	We stayed at the hotel various nights in December 2008 and used the hotel as our hub for a number of trips throughout India.The hotel has been renovated recently and now offers business-style, clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom (the best one we had during our trip, always enjoyed coming back there ...).From the hotel, you have easy acces to various shops (incl. Western shops with sometimes attractive proces) at Connaught Place, restuarants included. From the hotel its only a few meters to the new subway, that brings you e.g. directly to the railway stations for hardly any money. We used it several times and always enjoyed the ride.The hotel staff is professional and also takes take of the guest's needs. We used both airport pick-ups and drop-offs.The restaurant at the hotel offers very good food, the elevated prices (compared to other options outside the hotel) are worth it and the staff is great and friendly.There might be cheaper place to stay in Delhi, but Palace Heights benefits from its central location, professional staff and proper rooms. We'd go back there if we return to Delhi."
33,1658,"Dec 3 2008 	Fantastic!	Stayed at the hotel for a business trip, the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful. Will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi! Highly recommended."
34,1658,"Dec 2 2008 	Great Stay	We stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the US. We went ahead and arranged for transport to the hotel (RS. 800) to avoid having to deal with prepaid taxis upon arrival. The hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport. Check-in was smooth and though our room was a bit small, it was very comfortable. We were provided with complementary fruit and bottled water daily. I especially appreciated how quiet it got at night. We had a minor issue with the hot water but it was rectified very quickly. Breakfast in the hotel was good and very convenient. We had dinner at Bukhara at the Maurya. The food was fabulous!The hotel arranged for a day tour of Delhi using their car and also for early morning transport to the Delhi railway station. Although we found the tariff to be a little overpriced, we would definitely stay here again for the amenities and the convenience."
35,1658,"Dec 1 2008 	An affordable gem	Recently, I was looking for a centrally located, hotel in Delhi, which was not $300/ night! Happened to go through the reviews on your website and came across Hotel Palace Heights in Connuaght Place that seemed to fit in my budget, and scheme of things  both in terms of location and just the general feel. I was able to easily make my bookings through emails that were promptly answered and all doubts were clarified. From the moment I entered to the time I checked out (4 days), I knew I had made the right choice and had found really good hotel in Delhi. A place that I would like to come back to and recommend to others. The rooms were very clean and done in a very fashionable style, but most importantly comfortable to stay in. Some hotels take fashion to an extreme and make it uncomfortable But this place seems to have struck the right balance. The in-house restaurant was an absolute treat. Seems to be a very popular choice as there was a long waiting even on weekdays. The hotel was very courteous to keep tables for hotel guests on hold and never made us wait for a table. Plus a special discount for hotel guests in the restaurant. Also the room service was very efficient and even at 3 am in the morning the food was served with a smile. The Internet was truly, wireless and truly unlimited with no snags or hidden costs. In India, many a places advertise about their wireless but it really is pathetic. Initially, I had some technical difficulty getting on to their wireless on my MAC, but the front office guy came and solved everything within no time. A suggestion to the hotel: it really is a nice place, though they do have a long list of wines, cocktails and all kinds of alcohols being served; available in the rooms and in the restaurant. A small watering hole that one can go to after a long day of work in the city will go a long way in making me feel even more at home. Wink wink."
36,1658,"Nov 1 2008 	Definately a good place to stay Service is the best	After reading the revieiws, we booked the hotel. I was hoping for a clean place, and they defnately met that requirement. The room we had was a bit small as others had pointed out, but it was clean, well equipped, comfortable, and right in the middle of the city, close to most everything.The real standout was the service at the hotel. They carried our bags, arranged for transportation, had excellent room service, and met any extra request we had. One of our travelers in the groups was sick. They went out and got her medication we requested, made special meals for her, and kept an eye on her when we went out exploring the city. I couldn't have asked for anything more for my little sister when she was sick.Definately eat in the hotel's restaurant. It is great food. I was really worried when we arrived, because from the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall and I would never have booked it, but it is completely different from the inside. Don't let the outside picture worry you.Because it is located in the heart of the city (Connaught Place), it is a bit expensive, but you are paying for the location. It is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area when we were looking."
37,1658,"Oct 4 2008	Great choice in this price range.	The Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range. The location, rooms, service are great and the restaurant is fantastic. The staff were especially helpful and welcoming. Highly recommended."
38,1658,"Sep 22 2008 	It's ok - but come for the food	Good points:- No noise from street- Central location- Cheap / good value- Good facilities in room (plasma TV, large bathroom, minibar)- EXCELLENT restaurant with 24 hour room service. Come here like the locals to eat fantastic North Indian food- Very reliable airport transfers, cars were right on time- Helpful staff who rectified issues immediately (see below)Bad points: - Noise from other people's rooms, slamming doors, voices in the corridor etc- Bed sheets and towels were dirty when I arrived - but this was quickly rectified - Surfaces also dirty - reception didn't apologise but immediately sent a cleaner - Expensive minibar - but what do you expect! - The sink drain was very smelly and some flies congregated around itIt's a good choice but expect some noise from other guests, and question the reception if you don't feel things are that clean."
39,1658,"Sep 10 2008 	Friendly 	I've booked this hotel via Desiya an Indian website and got a good price. I was a bit concerned as I was going over with my small fella and the wife. It has been a wonderful experience - breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious! As my wife was indisposed for 3 days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals. I had my Beer &amp; dinner all days at the hotel and the service was attentive - they served good mughalai dishes! My son had Rice &amp; Dal Makhni all the time which he call Brown Sauce!! As mentioned already the TV is good as all rooms had independent SKY receivers for entertainment. This is a very well located hotel for shopping trips to Pallika Bazaar and short distance away from Ghafaar market, thoroughly enjoyed the walking until I got dehydrated?!!! Very clean place which has recently been redecorated - recommended."
40,1658,"Sep 3 2008 	Clean Modern cozy central	While travelling to India I booked through the internet this hotel.There were not many pictures and not much information but reviews seemed to be good enough so I took the risk. It was well worth it. This small hotel in the centre of New Delhi, is not only close to everything but may be the the best choice for an affordable yet clean and beautiful stay. It was recently renovated and although the rooms are small, it has good service, it is clean and quiet (unlike the rest of India). has aircondition (but no heating.. even though the temperature on January is quite low.). I definitely reccomend it as a safe, cheap, and clean choice."
41,1658,"Sep 2 2008 	Fantastic!	A true gem. Hotel Palace Heights is a superb boutique hotel in the heart of Delhi. Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer. Spotless rooms and central location, the hotel's Saffron Restaurant is also a treat.Staying there was truly heaven. Our thanks to the wonderful staff who made our stay in Delhi memorable."
42,1658,"Aug 12 2008 	Clean great staff - a little gem	While a lot less ostentatious and pricey than the big international hotels in ND, this little place really deserves its high rating.Stayed here for a few days arriving in India, and then again one night before shipping back to Europe. The staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities (plasma TV every room with international news channels for those of us that still like to stay in touch). While located smack in the middle of Connaught Place with plenty of restaurants around, the hotel restaurant is also worth a visit. Well priced and delicate food, looked after and managed by a very helpful manager and really nice staff.The only drawback is the lack of pool / SPA. For that, you have to go to the bigger hotels in the outskirts of town (well, so so) so its up to you if you want to make that trade off. All in all, a place we can warmly recommend!"
