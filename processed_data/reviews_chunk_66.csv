43,1658,"Jul 10 2008 	Clean safe and comfortable hotel in Dehli!	Arrived in New Delhi and our transfer was waiting, as promised. Check-in was easy and the staff were great. The room was modern, but small and the view was less than spectacular. If you plan to be in Delhi for a short stay and will be on the go most of the time, this place is great. If you are planning to spend nights in, it could feel a bit tight. That said, everything else was amazing. The room itself is has a flat screen TV, snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge. Room service is great and it's offered 24 hours a day. The linens were very nice and very clean. The pillows were lovely. The bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling marble, the shower was large and there was a good supply of hot water. I think the power may have been an issue once, but not bad. The towels were clean and all the toiletries offered were nice. The complimentary breakfast was huge! For the low price this is a winner, clean, great service and a central location make this hotel hard to beat!"
44,1658,"Jun 16 2008 	comfortable stay	I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; had both the dinners here. The hotel is a contemporary one with all the style, elegance &amp; modern amenities. The food in the restaurant- Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds."
45,1658,"Jun 8 2008 	Stay away for the love of God	We just completed a 5 days stay at the hotel. two days prior to our arrival we asked for airport pickup. That didn't happen, and not much of an apology was provided.We arrive at the hotel. and it takes them 30 minutes to check us in, even though we are the only ones there. Funny thing about that, the hotel claim to have 40 rooms, actually they only have 15. and the lies continue. They also claim to have free internet access. what they mean is, if you have a good internet subscription for your phone, it will also work within their hotel. They still tried to convince me they actually did have a wireless network, I said show me, then they said, they don't know how, and they can't call anyone.The room is so small, you feel clostrophobic. And the aircondition only has icy cold or really hot. The &quot;fancy&quot; flatscreen is the oldest LCD samsung available, and the picture quality is awful. All the furniture is cheap plastic.Someone below has mentioned they give complementary fruits, water and cookies. but don't eat the cookies, otherwise, you don't get any new ones, and if you don't eat the fruit, they just leave it. see the tasty picture of the moldy fruit. and even the bottled water is expired. are you kidding me.The building, is a completely delapidated building, doesn't matchwebsite pictures.the &quot;wonderful restaurant and breakfast&quot; that someone mentioned. There are two fruits cut last night, some cereal, and then you can order and omelet or pancakes. Don't do the last, it gave us a little brown present for two days - if you know what I mean.Location: connaught place is really dirty, shopping is very good, but you just feel disgusted with the dirt and flies. If you are Indian, no problem, but if you are white, there are 1000 conmen ready to approach you in a very aggresive way. Our Indian friend also advised us not to go outside after 7. yes, I said 7.Now to the masterpiece. The reception. They are 20 years old, and have the combined intelligence of a 10 year old. They cannot answer any questions, like airport question, shopping question, internet question, etc etc. When we were checking out, the boy spent 30 minutes counting the minibar, and when we went back to the room, he actually checked one more time before we could leave, just to make sure we didn't take a 40 Rupee cola. keep in mind we just spent 32500 rupees for the room.All in All, do yourself a big favour. Do not budget travel in Delhi. We have been to a few hotels in India, and this one takes the price. WOW."
46,1658,"Apr 25 2008	fine for a short stay	Arrived at this hotel located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connaught Place just before midnight and the staff were expecting us. The room is clean, functional and 'modern', with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture, decorations and bathroom. Linen was spotless and towels plentiful, and there were chocolate biscuits for an evening snack along with complimentary bottled water. But the room felt small, and if there was any more than one of you it would not be somewhere you could relax at the end of a long day's sightseeing or really get comfortable if you just wanted a 'day off'. Theres something a bit clinical and cold about the dcor. We stayed there in transit (arrived midnight, departed 0700 the next morning) and it was fine, as it would be if you were on business and in meetings all day. Breakfast was included in the room rate and you can have it either in the restaurant or delivered to your room (no extra charge). The breakfast was fine without being memorable. The hotel gets an 'above average' rating because it was clean, the staff helpful, and the cost spot-on."
47,1658,"Apr 21 2008 	very nice hotel	We stayed 4 nights in this nice hotel very welll located, clean , staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran In a previous review one person mention that the only bad thing he could say was that the towel were old, well they replace it for new one The beds are very confortable . They give you every day 2 bottles of water and fruits , newspaper in the morning and on arrival they serve you juice. We tried near the hotel the Zen restaurant which was very good , it is about 5 minutes by walk from the hotel on your right side when you get out of the hotel. Do not be surprise but when you arrive the building do not announce what is inside the hotel is on the seconf floor of an old buiding, the hotel was renovated 1 year ago. It is not expensive for New Delhi do not hesitate to book ."
48,1658,"Apr 17 2008 	Great	Just great. Very well located in Connaught Place, great rooms, nice furnished and modern decoration, flat screen tv, nice bathrooms, nice restaurant, very friendly staff, affordable... Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back."
49,1658,"Apr 15 2008 	Very good hotel	I went to India on April the 3rd and stay at Palace Heights for 2 days after going to Jaipur, and stayed there in the last night in India on April the 10th. This is a very nice hotel, good rooms, not very large but OK, with LCD TV and they offer each day mineral water and a fruit basket. The bathroom was very good too.The dinner and breakfast room was nice, and the staff very friendly. And I must say this is an hotel in the center of Delhi, near the Indian and international shops. I recommend this hotel."
50,1658,"Apr 10 2008 	Cute little hotel	Very small room. The staff were friendly and helpful . It's very good for the price and location and running around in Delhi.The restaraunt, Zaffron, is the best thing about this hotel. The menu is great and the prices are about $15 per meal.I recommend this hotel when you are in Delhi."
51,1658,"Apr 8 2008 	Refreshingly good...a must stay on your visit to Delhi	Location: at the heart of the city. you can never ask for a better location. This is considered to be the finest location in New Delhi.Rooms, Staff, Service, Reception: ExcellentBreakfast: Complimentry and excellent choice of menu.Very good decor and so peaceful."
52,1658,"Apr 4 2008 	A Hidden Gem	Excellent management &amp; staff:-This place has an unassuming front and is fairly new. Small with 14 rooms, but excellently managed. Well staffed and no pressure to tip whatsoever. Your every wish is their command and they make you feel special. Asked for hair dryer, iron, extra towels etc. and all supplied within minutes. Forgot to switch off the &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; outside the door on one occasion. Hence found rooms not made on return in evening. Called reception. No problem. Room made up in 10 minutes. Seldom does one see such service.No queues for check-in or check out as there are only 14 rooms.24 hour room service @ no extra charge. Safe deposit &amp; Minibar Good air con / heating .Thick fabric window blinds keep the blazing sunlight out and let you have a late morning sleep.Plasma TV on wallComfortable super king size bed with nice pillowsLarge interior illuminated wardrobe with plenty of space. 2 full length dressing mirrors on wall .Complimentary breakfast - cereal, fruit juice,egg, bacon, sausage, toast, Indian poori with potato masala. Egg served many ways. Try the masala omlette which is like a spanish omlette &amp; is lovely. Coffee expresso, cappucino or simply black.Free newspaper and a call for breakfast before they close at 10.30am (in case you forget)!Toilet:Extremely clean &amp; shiny toilet with a brilliant shower. Plenty of hot water. Shampoo, body lotion and soaps all provided. This the only hotel toilet I have ever seen where the mirrors do not get misted after a shower, thanks to the excellent ventilator fan, which also removes any odours instantly. Plenty of thick clean towels.Airport pick up by hotel worked well.Restaurant:Checked in at 12pm after a late flight and although it was closing time for the attached Zaffiran restaurant, they still let me order from the menu! Their food is very good . Tandoori chicken cooked to perfection. Also try their lamb dish (cant remember the name) which is a whole leg of lamb prepared with exquisite spices. The hyderabadi mutton biriyani is also recommended. Plenty of locals eat here. For $25 2 people can have a three course meal! Nice decor and ambience as well.And all this for GBP $150 per night in Connaught place. What more can you ask for? Interestingly, when I tried to book rooms via trip advisor, all the booking agents said &quot;room not available&quot; and offered rooms at other places, but when I emailed the hotel directly, they had vacancies!On the other hand if you want window views and gardens, look elsewhere, but for the price, this place cant be beaten.Certainly recommended and will stay here again.Good management always counts!"
53,1658,"Apr 3 2008 	Did not honor reservation agreement	I shared a room with two friends. The manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit. On arrival they told us we will only have the room for three nights. Different people manning the hotel reception gave conflicting reasons why this is so. However their reasons were not convincing as from the booking screen on their computer we noticed that two other guest were booked into our reservation. Furthermore the manager that agreed on our six night reservation is nowhere to be found even by his own staff. They tried to move us to another related hotel that is out of the city center which we refuse to due to their prior breech of trust. We were in Delhi for a conference and had to skip part of it to look for another hotel. This was extremely disruptive. The impression I have is the hotel tries to get you there before moving you to a less popular co-owned hotel due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;. I recommend not using this hotel for important business since they do not honor their reservation agreements unless you do not mind finding another hotel at the last minute. Apart from this, the rooms are well furnished as expected for the price that they charge, and service is prompt."
54,1658,"Mar 30 2008 	Great Choice for One Night	Overall, this was a fine place to stay for one night; however, no one met us on arrival at IGIA to take us to the hotel, even though we had previously booked the transfer and re-confirmed prior to arrival. Not the best way to start off our stay. The hotel claims someone was there, and we just didn't see him. We waited for 45 minutes, then decided that no one was coming. There were TONS of drivers with signs waiting, just not for us. We took a pre-paid taxi, which was easy and reasonable, but taxi drivers don't seem to know where this hotel is. If they can get you to Connaught Place (which they DO know), just stop someone on the street and ask for the hotel, telling them that it's located behind the Odeon Cinema (there is more than one cinema in Connaught, though). The hotel is very small and unassuming, somewhat difficult to spot from the street (it's on the second/upper floor above storefronts). There is an entry door on the ground level, which was well-lit and staffed by a security guard and two other employees (e.g., bellman and restaurant maitre 'd, I think). There is a lift to the second floor. The lobby area is tiny (just the front desk and two chairs), off which is the Zaffron restaurant (attractive, well-staffed, but we only had drinks so I can't comment on the food). Our room was tiny as well, just enough room to walk around the perimeter of the bed. The bathroom was a decent size, with standing shower and Western toilet. Some basic toiletries were provided. Hairdryer upon request. The room was very modern and pleasant-looking, with a comfy bed, suede throw pillows, and flat-screen TV. Complimentary wi-fi access in the rooms worked perfectly. Two bottles of complimentary water were provided, along with chocolates and a fruit plate (we did not get to sample the included breakfast due to an early departure), welcome drinks upon arrival. The hotel was able to change money for us; there was no ATM machine visible nearby. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again; it's a great value (approximately $150 USD for a double room) once you find the location."
55,1658,"Mar 9 2008	Excellent hotel	stayed 1 night, extremely helpful staff, clean modern room, good restaurant, a sanctuary in the middle of delhi, very near excellent metro system stationi have only positives to say about this hotel"
56,1658,Feb 21 2008 	Smashing hotel !!! Clean tidy and central!! 4 star !!!	This hotel is lovely. its clean tidy and very well positioned. it bang in the heart of everything. I would rate it as 4 star !!!The staff are friendly and alway willing to help you.There is also a lovey restaurante in the hotel.The rooms are fitted with a plasma screen tv and mini bar.There is also a railway near by. we went to agra for the day to see the taj mahal. its 2 hours on the express train or 4 hours on the normal locals train. we went on the express train to agra and returned on the locals train just for the experience. i would reccomend this.
57,1658,Feb 16 2008 	good central hotel	This is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhiIts in a central location and the staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or anotherIt was clean and comfortable but the towels were old and grey!When i started looking for a hotel in delhi it was really difficult to find one that wasn't either really expensive or that looked dirtyThis was neither even though it was more expensive than any other hotels i stayed in in india but it was definitely worth it
58,1658,"Jan 27 2008 	Wonderful Boutique Hotel	The Hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi.The service overall is outstanding. Full of nice touches - complimentary fruit bowl &amp; chocolates on arrival - the best hotel soaps &amp; lotions I have ever used - and very good breakfast with courteous &amp; professional staff. The rooms *are* small (as is the hotel - no large foyer or bars you enter via lift) so I would not book for an extended stay - but they are as modern and stylish as you will find anywhere, for a weekend or overnight you couldn't ask for more. I booked direct via email - and though I had change my original booking to 1 night (from 2) in email this was not acknowledged - so ensure you are clear from the outset. But I was not penalised so all went well. I'm in debt to the fellow reviewers on this website - I would not have found or chosen it without your help - so I am glad to add my voice to chorus of approval - my only regret is not staying in Delhi for longer !"
59,1658,"Jan 6 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	When I first started searching the net for a Delhi hotel I was horrified at the cost of accommodation. We definitely wanted to stay in or close to Connaught Place because it is so central and position is very important . I realised I would have to pay a bit more than usual but searched for medium hotels. The Palace Heights looked ok and the photos on the hotel website were good. It said that the hotel had recently been re-furbished. I realise now that this refurbishment is in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Took the plunge and booked. My husband and I were travellling with another couple and none of us were strangers to India, so we were prepared for disappointment. Arrived at the airport and took a pre-paid taxi. Remember to have the printed full address on hand to show the driver. Connaught Place is divided into sections and it's important for the driver to have the full address. We arrived and took the lift to reception. Looked allright, clean and modern. Yes, they were expecting us (relief) and we were shown to our rooms. Airconditioned, modern and clean with flat screen television on the wall. The bathroom was compact, marble and clean. There was no view from the window but yes, the hotel passed our test. We ate at the restaurant and it was excellent. It was packed with locals which is always a huge recommendation. We stayed three nights and had no complaints. Then we left our heavy luggage there while we travelled in Rajasthan for a week. We returned for a final night, luggage was safe and sound, restaurant still great, the staff always obliging. Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was ordered from the menu - nothing flash but certainly good. This is a good hotel and certainly fits the bill for those not wanting to pay 5 star Delhi prices but wanting pleasant surroundings, cleanliness and a safe place to rest and of course position."
60,1658,"Jan 4 2008	Great Hotel in the heart of New Delhi	Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi is a great hotel. We stayed there on two seperate occasions during our trip to India and were pleased with both experiences. The hotel has been renovated relatively recently. The rooms are very modern and sleek, and most importantly, clean. The room we got on our first night in Delhi was small, but comfortable. The bathroom was clean and new, and the water hot. On our second time around, the room was bigger, which was nice, and equally clean and comfortable. It seems in Delhi that there are few options in the mid-range budget - everything is either ridiculously expensive and luxurious, or ridiculously cheap and disgusting. Hotel Palace Heights is right in the middle in terms of price and a wonderful bargain. It is in the heart of Connaught Place, too, which is an excellent location. The attached restaurant, Zaffran, is delicious. The food is safe and clean and really excellent. The service matches the food and decor. Like many places in India, the menu shows no liquor or beer, but it is available, which you will no doubt be glad to know after any amount of time in India. The staff were kind and helpful. Highly recommended."
61,1658,"Jan 2 2008 	Heaven after Hell!	We stayed here for 1 night on the 13th December after 2 nights at the Hotel Ajanta (see seperate review).This hotel is in Connaught Place, section D. We booked with the hotel after turning up with our suitcase! I was trying to work out where to stay in the taxi from the Ajanta Hotel, it was that bad! This hotel worked out at approx 80 bed &amp; breakfast for the two of us.Room was small but had everything you needed, reminded me of a Marriott hotel back home. Bathroom was lovely, water was either very hot or cold but hey a small price considering where we had just come from! Plasma TV on wall, coffee &amp; tea facilities. They also gave us fresh orange juice and a fresh fruit platter - nice touch! Breakfast was freshly cooked. This area is very western with KFC, Macdonalds, TGI Friday's etc but we ate at a restaurant next door from our hotel called The Embassy - nice food but be aware as not only do they add a service charge they also add 'output VAT'.  I would recommend anyone to stay here but as it's a little bit expensive it would probably be ok for the 1 night."
62,1658,"Dec 1 2007 	A pleasant place to stay in New Delhi	My girlfriend and I stayed one night at Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi on 27/11/07. Having spent most of our holiday in India (Rajasthan) in budget accommodation, we decided to spend a bit more to just chill out for our last night in India.Our double room cost 5500Rs + 12.5% tax including breakfast. The room was excellent - comfortable, extremely clean, a nice ambience (the staff said the hotel had been refurbished around February this year). There were some nice touches like complimentary welcoming drinks (apple juice) and later a fruit platter during our stay. Service at the hotel was reasonable without being fabulous. Reliable hot water but in our room it was very difficult to find a comfortable temperature (ie. temp was either very hot or cold).Because we didn't really spend much of our holiday in similar accommodation, I am unsure whether this price is reasonable or comparable to other hotels in New Delhi. The only thing I could compare it to is Hotel Jukaso Inn (Connaught Place), recommended by Lonely Planet, which we booked online in a last minute rush for our first night in India, for which we foolishly paid 3850Rs + tax for a double room - it was terrible (dirty, small)... completely different to Hotel Palace Heights, which is literally a few doors away."
63,1658,"Nov 27 2007 	Great hotel great location	Hotel Palace Heights is a great hotel in a great situation in Delhi.The staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing. The room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views. The bed was very comfy.We ate lightly in their restaurant on our last night in India the food was good and I felt that we should have taken advantage of this earlier in our stay.Although our room was small, I felt that the Hotel Palace Heights is aspiring to great things."
64,1658,"Nov 23 2007 	Lovely small hotel	This is a very small and charming hotel situated very centrally in the buzz of Connaught Place, about 45 mins drive from the airport. It has been very recently refurbished to a high standard with modern and tasteful decor. The staff were very friendly, courteous and attentive throughout my 2 night stay. The room was not particularly large, but had a big bed, flat screen tv, and immaculate marble bathroom with large shower. There is no view to speak of, but that didn't bother me. The restaurant is also excellent, serving very tasty and good value Indian food in pleasant surroundings, with a good choice for breakfast (not buffet). I found it very difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in Delhi which looked any good, and did not want to stay in the big chain hotels. This hotel fitted the bill perfectly - I can thoroughly recommend it to anyone."
65,1658,Nov 23 2007 	Excellent hotel	Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location. Close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city. Rooms are clean and everything works. Very nice and helpful staff. Really a great place to stay for peoplpe who want a save haven in a crazy city !! Close to all the shops at Cannaugt place.
66,1658,Jun 27 2007 	Excellent place to stay	This Hotel is located in CP in Delhi. Simply VOW... I think its a boutique hotel.Its truely amazing. Room rent was around Rs 4500/= for single room and experience was fantastic.Room was very small but stylishly done. It had flat screen TVand the interiors were superb.Thumbs up and 5 stars to this hotel.

68,1658,Apr 17 2008 	Absoluter Geheimtipp
1,1659,Very friendly staff; Convenient Location	Stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi. The hotel arranged car service to/from the int'l airport and to/from the Taj Mahal the next morning. I definitely recommend this hotel as a stress-free way of traveling around and into/out of Delhi - they took care of everything and were happy to assist.
2,1659,"Nov 24 2009 	Wonderful service clean rooms and well connected with local drivers	This place is perfect if you are interested in keeping the costs down, while also enjoying a clean and safe room. The frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests, and they arranged drivers, and guides who took us to the Taj M. as well as to and from both the airport and the train station. The wokers at the hotel even gave us early morning warm Nescafe mocha drinks. If I ever make it back to Delhi I would for sure stay at the Hotel Pearl Plaza."
3,1659,"Nov 24 2009 	Great hotel - Clean 	My boyfriend, two friends, and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Prior to our trip I was emailing with a number of hotels in this neighborhood near the train station. Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive. In advance he arranged for:--A car to pick us up at the airport at 2am when our flight arrived--A car, driver, and guide for a day trip to Agra--2 Clean hotel rooms with plenty of bottled water We had a great experience. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The prices for the hotel and all the additional services they arranged for us were also very reasonable. Happy travels!"
4,1659,"Nov 15 2009 	Nice place reality of India will hit you in this neighbourhood	We stayed at this hotel a few times. The rooms are OK. The linens are not spotless, definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotels/hostals (unless you go to upscale places), so bring your own if you wish. Also if you use the AC, there is no blanket and it gets pretty cold. I had my sleeping bad. The first time we stayed the AC worked the whole time and the room was freezing. The next time, the AC was turned off through the main switch downstairs so it got stuffy and hot. Complain and ask for a discount if this happens. Everything is negotiable in India!Rickshaws and taxis are easily accessible, the staff will even fetch you one if needed. Friendly, safe, hot water, good price.Located in Paharganj, metro station (Rama Krishna) is 2min walk, plenty of dirt and beggars, so if your first time and day in India, be prepared to be shocked. New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than 40-50 rupees. Nizamuddin is farther away."
5,1659,"Jun 6 2009 	Clean hotel reasonable prices	We stayed at Pearl Plaza in Paharganj, Delhi for 2 nights in the middle of May 2009. We got lost in Paharganj (which is a big market) on our way there on the first day, but on the second day we had no problems finding it anymore, even at night.Here is a summary of our impressions from the Pearl Plaza.positive:- email communication with the hotel was very fast (we made a reservation in advance. In Delhi making a reservation in advance is strongly reccomended, as there are not so many good hotels and prices are quite high)- very good price for double AC room (no breakfast, but breakfast could be booked extra for 80 Rs. p.P.) - 1100 Rs including taxes.- reasonable price for airport pick up - 600 Rs for AC car. The Airport is quite far away from the city (ca 30min drive). Prepaid taxis from the eirport are cheaper, however.- friendly staff- nice, modern furniture- warm water- comfortable beds- clean linen- laundry and dry- cleaners' service which was quite cheap (15Rs. p. piece of clothing) and returns the laundry on the same day- free tea around the clock- TV and fridge- a lot of restaurants, internet cafes and shopping possibilities all around.negative:- no internet- many rooms have no windows- ACs temperature is being controlled centrally, by the reception staff. Thatswhy our room was quite cold when the AC was on. We even could not switch it off ourselves.- no wardrobe in the room"
6,1659,Sep 1 2009 	buona sistemazione e buon prezzo
1,1665,"Go for the upgrade room	My first trip to India. May not be my last, but my last to Delhi and Northern India. Stayed two nights. This hotel is ok. Friends made reservations. Had I known about upgrade rooms I would have insisted on one. Should have checked with them on what hotel they made reservations for. In the future in India - will insist on 4 star hotels. Have stayed in 3 stars in Europe and in Russia - but not the same. Would recommmend with explanation to get upgrade room. A friend did leave clothes in the room. When we came back a week later they had her clothes for her. So that was a plus."
2,1665,"Regent Continental - OK for an overnight in Delhi	Arrived at hotel late pm after 6 hour drive from Agra. Lobby clean and quite and impressive compared to surroundings and check in ok. Room average, air-con and TV worked but strong air freshener smell which turned out to be the insect repellent device in the bathroom, in fact there seemed to be a paraffin type smell in the corridors too. We went to the restaurant and looked at the a la carte menu but the maitre d' was very persistent that we and all other guests had the Indian buffet already prepared. We eventually acquiesced rather than chance Delhi at night as the area around the hotel was not too inviting. Turned out the buffet was expensive compared to the menu, I think we were misled. All well and went to bed. Breakfast was buffet style and ok too and there seemed to be a predominance of business people. Overall adequate for an overnight stay, and like most people you have to modify your thinking and expectations when staying in India on a 3 star basis.."
3,1665,"Nov 24 2009 	be careful which room your given	when we arrived we were given a room that resembled a dungeon. we complained and were assured that a better room would be given on our return 3 weeks later. it was better, but not much. make sure you see all type of rooms. silver is smaller but much better. service and food was very good however and location very good"
4,1665,"Nov 17 2009 	nice place...	my frnds booked this place for me as i hv been living in Petersburg since last 5 yrs. took time off to meet my frnds here. stayed here for 5 nights, before shifting to my frnds place. i zstayed all alone here but found it very comfortable. everything, the t.v , gyser nd ac , all worked fine. the breakfast buffet was grand and offered me many options. overall a nice place.the market around is pretty good. nice place to shop. the staff bell boy and rest too were ever smiling... keep it up people...nice and quiet place in the lively market...."
5,1665,"Nov 12 2009 	made my function memorable...!!!	i had my engagement on 30th of oct. and the arrangements were made by regent continental in their hall. this is just to thank the hotel on a whole on this public wall... most of our guests(relatives) arrived from punjab and canada, so we all booked this hotel for 2 nights and their banquet for the functn. . they made excellent arrangements for everything at the function. we even changed the colour theme of the decoration a night before to match it with my dress and expected the staff to show reluctance, but they all took it very sportingly. we enjoyed alot a night before and all thanks to these people, they made sitting arrangement for all of our extended family and us to play games in the night in their banquet hall and that too complimentary !! whole night we all kept odering snacks , tea and all and the service throughout was excellent.thanks to all!!!"
6,1665,"Nov 10 2009 	my money is well used...good shopping n staying place in the capital	i visited delhi in march 2009 n stayed in hotel regent continental for 4 days before i went ahead to jaipur.it was a good experience for a first timmer to india. India is a good country,the people are also very nice. My stay in the above mentioned hotel was done by my travel agent as i wasnt very keen on spending too much money on stay.but off course i wanted a safe ,cosy ,confortable n economical place as i was accompanied with my partner. The hotel took good care of us for the 4 days we stayed there. Service was good n so was the food.Being centrally located in delhi it was very convinent for us to travel to different place using the sky train. It was a lovely experience n i would certainlly like to go n stay there if ever i go to delhi next time."
7,1665,Nov 6 2009 	wonderfull experience	I am staying in Bangalore. I would like to share the experience of my delhi stay which part of jaipur trip. We reached quite late night in Delhi. It was our first visit and we were in quite tension. Booked this hotel through internet. And to our pleasure we were received by the reception with a warm smile. Our rooms were already allotted. So had hassle free check in. Quite decent gold class room. Clean and tidy. But what impressed me the most was the room-service. We were served food as late as 2 a.m. and it was delicious. Thanks to Mr.mukherjee we were offered huge variety. we had to check out the next day for our trip to Jaipur. Loved the stay though. The staff did a commendable job to make our stay comfortable. Thank u all
8,1665,Oct 27 2009 	Value for money...nice place to stay	i visited this hotel in march 2009 as some of my colleagues were comming in from the US. Since their visit was only for 3 days and they wanted to do some shopping as well so i decided to put them in a hotel in the heart of the city.A friend of mine recomemded me this hotel in karol bagh called regent continental.On my instructions the hotel made arrangements to pick my guests from the airport.i booked 2 super delux rooms along with a full time cab for 3 days. In these 3 days i visited the hotel very often.By the end of the stay all my guests were very happy with the room service as well as the staff courtesy.When the bill came to me for clearance i was surprised to see such a descent price of everything.It was a nice experience with hotel regent continental. great going guys.
9,1665,"Oct 20 2009 	really very poor value	stayed here on our tour of northen india, by far the worst hotel.rooms were very small and dated. I don't know where the room photoswere taken but our rooms were nothing like those in the photos.service and food were very poor and breakfast was worrying as food was kept,well, warm. overall we were very disappionted with both rooms and location."
10,1665,"Oct 6 2009	Terrible experience at Regent Continental	Noisy at all hours of day and night; in the middle of the night you could hear staff shouting and talking loudly and dogs barking incessantly outside.Room dirty, asked to change the room we were given cause the shower was filthy, second room wasn't much better.Dining room disgusting, dirty tables, dirty cloths, dirty cutlery. In the end they also claimed that we hadn't paid something (false) and receptionists started shouting and cursing against us and refused to give back passports until we paid what we wanted.Would never ever go back there!!!"
11,1665,"Sep 28 2009 	Disguting Hotel	This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. Do not be fooled by the pictures on their web site the rooms do not look like that at all. The hotel is situated in a rundown, dirty and overcrowded area in what can only be described as virtually an alley way. Our room was too small to swing a cat in. The bed clothes were dirty. It was situated internally within the building so had no outside window. A small window overlooked a shaft reminiscent to a coal mine shaft. This was lit and hence lit our room at night. The bathroom was disguising, ancient and filthy. The towels were grey. The air-conditioning unit was so noisy you couldn't sleep. It also did not work and it must have been 30 degrees plus in our room. We complained to the front desk and they virtually ignored us saying they were full and there were no alternative rooms. It was only after my wife said she would sleep in the reception that they reluctantly took action. First they showed us an identical room and only after further complaints showed us to a so called VIP room. This was also disgusting but was larger and had a window to the outside world or should I say alleyway. The air conditioning also worked slightly better. What sums up the hotel was the employee running his fingers along the bed headboard and all surfaces to check they were clean. Of course they were not. There were also kids running up and down the corridors screaming all night. Apparently they also have student accommodation.This hotel had been booked for us by an Indian Agency who otherwise was very good. We have registered a complaint with them. Although we were supposed to stay two nights we moved out and paid for another hotel. We tried to get our money back at the reception and asked to see the manager. Needless to say he did not turn up. This may be India but I have stayed in many hotels in this country, some simple but always clean. This clearly is the worst my wife and I have seen."
12,1665,May 1 2009 	Clean and well located	The Hotel is well maintaines with clean hygenic rooms. Located in the centre of Karol Bagh close to the Delhi Metro station which makes moving about easier and fast.
13,1665,"Mar 27 2009 	' We were impressed ' !	I travelled with my partner and daughter in March 2009.We toured Northern India during March and as we arrived in Delhi and stayed at theRegent Continental Hotel located in Karol Bagh area of the city. As we were travelling South eg Agra/Matura/Gwalior and Orchha and then returning to travel north to Mussourie in Himalayas , we used Regent Continental Hotel as transit base for our travels. We ended up staying 5 nights at the Hotel.Hotel offers three types rooms (Silver/Gold or Platinum). We were shown all types of rooms but we were allocated Platinum class room . (312 &amp;112).The room was spacious and accomodated 3 of us very easily. The furnshing was of avery high quality. The lighting was well co-ordinated and everything worked egAC, TV (satalite), Fridge, Safe etcThe room was very clean and room service provided was of 5* standard andComplementary bottles of Mineral water for guests and various free- bees were providedin Bathroom ,incase one forgets pack the basics eg tooth brush/paste;comb;shaving gear; shampoos etc. These were replaced each day!The hotel is located in a very narrow street in Karol Bagh area of Delhi. An area known forits its Shopping and maze of conjested lanes with 100s of small hotels .If one is travelling to India or Karol Bagh for the first time then the street leading toHotel will appear dirty, unpleasing and not so welcoming but once you get into theHotel you will be won over by the welcoming staff.! I do not mention names of individuals when I do a review but I was hightly impressedby 3 individuals . Those were Mr. Anshu Bhatia (Reservations Manager) for hisproffesional service and prompt responses to our requests, Mr. Shakhar Chandre Reception Manager for all his dealing with us eg unlocking the safe when we forgot our personal codes- safekeeping of our luggage in storage when travellinfg South to Northand finally Mr Yashdev Malhotra ( Room Services). It is worth contacting them if you have any problems.The Hotel in our view was of good value and it gives likes of YWCAs and YMCA International House in Delhi run for its money as it can be cheaper and room quality and service is much better! Hotel has an independent Tour and Travel organisers on site and it seems thatprices charged by them are bit expensive and one has to be careful and it is easier to shop around for best deals with other agents in Karol Bagh area. You will have no problem in finding one!The restaurant in the hotel is ok. The furnishing and lighting is pleasing but themenu can be improved. The breakfast is provided in a Buffet form and bothContinental and local dishes are available. The hotel restaurant is busy the mornings when large tour company clients are often staying there! The Karol Bagh area does have several eateries within walking distance from Hotel,Those of us who get fed up after some time with curries and one can walk down few street to MacDonalds or Pizza Hut for a respite .I have stayed in several hotels in Delhi during my travels and i think this is one of the better ones.It is a 3 * hotel with 5* service. Our experience was postive and we would definately stay there again and I would recommend it to friends/colleagues/fellow travellers!"
14,1665,"Jan 4 2009 	Average	We arrived @ 10pm. our room was on the 1st floor. very bad ,smelling room.After complaining we were upgraded to the 2nd floor.Still not happy.The next day we were upgraded to a platium room.This was much better. However all the bathrooms are bad. Water pressure is low &amp; cold.We stayed there for 4 nights.Breakfast is not very nice.Staff dont speak English but helpful.Dont eat dinner in hotel.Will not go back"
15,1665,"Sep 28 2008 	Better than expected	I stayed in this hotel with 2 colleagues for a week in September. I had read the reviews before hand and I was dreading the experience.We arrived after midnight and the neighbourhood was scattered with garbage and wandering cows. We had a voucher and after just signing the hotel book (no other formalities) we were shown to our rooms on 1st floor. We each had standard single room which appeared to have been remodelled not long ago. White marble floors, ceiling fan, two beds pushed together, desk with a tv, small sitting area and very loud AC stuck to the wall. The room looked nice but lacked finishing. The bathroom had a shower with no curtain and modern looking wash basin with too small fauset. No real amenities except a shower cap, 2 bars of soap and shampoo. Though the bathroom was &quot;new&quot; there were small gaps in the grouting and everything looked worn and done in haste.The bed was very hard but the pillows were new and soft as well as the pillow covers. Other linen were greyish and many times washed. No duvet but a woollen blanket.The room had a window facing inner courtyard and noises from other houses were heard quite easily. As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is quite noisy because of marble flooring in corridoors and distant phone ringing every night. There is gap under the room door so every sound can be heard inside the room. Also other guests vere talking loudly when returning in the middle of the night. The AC unit is very loud but it does cover other noises if you can stand the humming.Second night when returning to the hotel and turning the lights on cockroaches were running around. Same happenend couple of times during the week but the roaches were not disturbing and only a few. When talking to others the roaches were not seen in every room. There was lot of personel in the hotel and young boys cleaning the corridoors and carrying the luggage. And waiting for tips of course. The hotel has a desk where to hire a car for a day or for trips but be aware of high prices and be ready to bargain hard.Breakfast was not very good. Instant coffee, sometimes toast, red jam, couple of Indian dishes, omelets,sweetened mango juice if you were lucky. All the food was lukewarm so be quick to grab the hot omelets when brought in or the hot toast. Two bottles of water were supplied to the room every day and not charged extra.The hotel is situated in the middle of Karol Bagh market district which means little &quot;shops&quot; for locals, lot of garbage, noice and people. Beggars will spot you right on when you walk out of the hotel. Easiest way to move is to hire a car or get a tuk tuk to the city center or riksha to the Karol Bagh metro station. When raining the streets are filled with muddy holes and floating garbage. All in all not as bad as expected."
16,1665,"Aug 24 2008 	Worst Hotel ... Beware	Beware of Checking in this Hotel. Despite our Advance Payment, while checkin had to wait for 45 minutes just to complete Formalities. No room allotment planning despite 3 rooms were booked. Pathatic food, Water was leaking from cieling... in monsoon... Hostile and rought staff.... Despite feedback to the Hotel, no courtesy / approach towards improvement. Beware of cleanliness and services also."
17,1665,"Mar 4 2008 	Stay at your own risk.	I stayed at the Regent Contenental for 4 nights in January 2008. Even from the start, I should have known better. I arrived early and was pleased to be shown to my room right away. BUT when we got there, I was told by the clerk that there was no key for this room and they were busy trying to find it. I thought that was strange but was so tired from a long trip on the Indian trains that I just put my stuff down and tried to relax. 3 hours later I called the desk asking about the key. Nothing in the room would work with out the key. No power at all. No, no word on the key ....yet. I waited an additional 2 hours before calling the desk again and telling the clerk that I was NOT willing to wait any longer. I had not had anything to eat or drink since the day before and it was now after 5 pm. I could not even leave my room to go find food and drink and none was offered to me. Finally, they brought me a key. From the housekeeping people I think. It had no fob and was just a key, nothing else. Good enough.. And he finally told me that the previous customer had made off with the key and they were &quot;waiting for him to bring it or send it back&quot;.  That night after finally getting some food and drink, I crawled into bed thinking that the noise would die down as the night wore on and I would get some badly needed sleep. Did not happen. The noise is almost unbelievable. All. Night. Long. The street noise is bad enough but the outer hallways and stairways are all stone and people yell up and down them all day and night. You can hear phones ringing constantly. The floors are so dirty that you have to wear shoes all the time. I finally found the room service menu stuffed in the bottom of the beside drawer and covered in big spots of mold. EWWW! Once I found out about room service, I did order tea and dinner. It was fine. No problems with that. On my second night I went to the hotel restaurant for dinner. I could not even get served. There was a buffet on so I grabbed a plate and some food. Never did get asked if I wanted so much as a glass of water. The next morning I thought about having a shower but there was no hot water. The tub was kinda dirty and the towels were a very deep grey so I guess it was a good thing I didn't . I had to call the desk yet again to get someone to come up and fix the hot water just so I could wash. I DO know how to operate hot water tanks in India and it was not working for me. The next day the toilet would NOT stop flushing so I called the desk again to ask someone to come up and fix it. You would have thought I was the worlds biggest pest! Imagine, to want hot water, a operating toilet and some food! I was always very careful to be polite. I did not show any disrespect for any of the staff.  In desperation, I tried to get my reservation for the next two nights canceled but I had paid up front through Orbitz and could get nowhere with that so I decided to stick it out. It never got any better. I don't know if the staff were rude and ignorant to me because I was a woman traveling alone or if they were that way with everyone. When it came time to check out, the desk clerk (manager) tried to make me pay for another night, saying that I stayed one night longer than I had paid for. When I asked him to get the receipt I gave him when I checked in ( from Orbitz,) he claimed it had been lost. I had to go on the hotel travel desk internet right there and then and pull up a copy of the receipt from my email in order to prove that I had paid for the correct number of nights. The Regent Continential is definately the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I have pictures of the room and the view if anyone is interested.  Stay at the White House or Wongdhen House in the Tibetan Village. A MUCH BETTER way to spend your Rupees."
18,1665,"Feb 2 2008 	Dreadful not fit for my dog	What a nasty hovel. The photos you see published in no way represent the squalor immiediately outside the front door or the mouldly noisy rooms you find inside. Staff either choose to speak no english or are just quite surly. The hardest thing to grasp is that when you ask a question they will lie to your face trying to get you in their cafe, shop, whatever."
19,1665,"Jan 26 2008 	poor value dishonest staff crooked travel agents	I booked this through a travel agent (Travel Zone, India) in Feb. 2007. It was noisy, dirty, and overpriced. Beware of the people at the tour desk. They are cheats as well. When I came back in August to Delhi, my new agent tried to book this place again for me telling me that my other choice (Clark International, 1 block away) was a far inferior choice. The agent's office is within blocks of both. I stayed at the Clark. It was great and cheaper. I know I will not deal with this agent again (Impact Holidays). I believe agents should be more interested in serving me ahead of the hotel!The Clark has since doubled their rates so next time I will try to find another place, but certainly not the Regent Continental."
20,1665,"Dec 30 2007	Bring earplugs!	The hotel was horrendously noisy well past midnight till 1 am or later. From our room, we could hear incessantly the loud slamming of doors, the clatter of kitchenware being cleaned, hotel staff talking loudly, furniture being dragged across the marble floor. This made it quite impossible to sleep. We also encountered problems with the shower, whereby we could barely coax out a trickle of hot water."
21,1665,"Nov 13 2007 	Regent CON-Dishonest Liers Complete misrepresentation Incompetent Theives!!!	I would only recommend to STAY CLEAR AT ALL COSTS.The website claims they have 24hr internet, a money safe, tea and coffee maker, business conference centre???? When I asked the manager about these facilities he pointed over to a computer over 10 years old which the internet did not work on one day of our stay and said they're you go? he said that was the 24hr internet?The state of the rooms was DISGUSTING with dead mosquitos on the bed linen, floor, bathroom etc.The floor was dirty, un-hygenic, opposite to the photos.The room had a horrible smell, maybe from previous guests who did GOD knows what.The bathroom was Disgusting with Mold growing on each and every corner. the bathroom was enough to put you off your whole day.The water was cold majority of the time.They are so tight that when you leave your room, they go in and switch of the fridge and a/c, which means you can say bye to having a cold refreshing drink in your fridge after a long day of walking around, even after we said not to switch it off again, the next day they switched it off again.The staff are basically 14-16 year old boys who go around in groups of 2-4 who stand around waiting for tips.No one understands english, which I think is disgraceful considering the hotel is called Regent Continental, I would Rename it Regent CON as this is simply a very dishonest service and misrepresentation of services.Stay clea from the restaurant unless you want to have runs and stomach aches for days on end, I had only one dinner their and felt sik for days after, would highly recommend to stay clear.The a.c Units are aftermarket units which make so much noise and rattles that you would rather put up with the heat than the noise.The location of this hotel is in the most awaful place you can imagine, it is surrounded by gangs, beggers, loud barking dogs and general traffic horning outside from early hours to late.The only reason why I stayed for more than one night was that they threatened to charge a cancellation charge if i ammended the orginal booking.I booked and paid for the classic deluxe room which at the time of booking I was tgold that the main difference was that the classic deluxe rooms offered a view with balcony,hehehe, the balcony could not even squeeze one person on their without squeezing past to get the door closed, it was terrible, absolutely no point whatsover.They also claimed to have sky tv, yer when it works, and their are only like 20 channels,all indian ones, so good luck if you dont understand the lingo.In overview I would only recpommend to stay as far away from this hotel as poss, they are lots of hotels in the area which offer a higher standard of facilities, cleaner enviroment for half the price.I would sum up the Regent continental as being a farse, con, rip-off, dishonest, untrustworthy, disrespectful.I forgot to mention that the price they quoted me at the start was not the price they demanded when departing after a few days, they had added a 600 per night charge on and removed the 10% discount and said it was only available if discussed at the start, which it was??? At that point i was so fedup with them, i did not have the energy to argue anymore as they didnt understand anything I was saying, and just paid them and thought, well at least I know to stay clear for the future. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to experience what I experienced at Hotel Con, BE aware, stay clear at all costs!"
22,1665,"Aug 4 2007 	Low Average beware of the limitations	I visited the hotel to meet someone who was there (I had also read the reviews posted here previously on the same hotel when I was looking for a place.)The Lobby Area looks empty. As indicated by another visitor on this site, they may advise visitors to take 'their&quot; taxi service. The Taxi Service is run by a separate unit (In the lobby) and the hotel staff do not coordinate with this unit in a satisfactory manner. i.e. telling the tourists to go and speak to them and totally disallowing responsibility for that aspect. I also noticed that their drivers may not Speak Any English too. (So make sure you check that before you get them for a hire). For anyone with a limited budget and looking for a budget hotel, this maybe ok, and the staff are helpful all right. Note that the area around the hotel can be a bit crowded. The area around (outside) the hotel is poorly illuminated."
23,1665,"Jul 20 2007 	So so	Its not a 3* for certain. Breakfast is a typical indian breakfast. we got food poisoning whilst here, but that could have been what we ate out..you never know! when we came ill the stafF were very helpful and friendly with great service. the rooms are spacious with airt con-but this is very noisey. in a decent location, very bustling! would not go again."
24,1665,"May 25 2007 	Disgraceful!!!	Checked in, stayed for an hour then checked out again. This hotel was worse than my dog kennel. Check in staff were rude. The whole reception area had an uncomfortable feel about it. The bathroom had no running water, there was scum, mould and anything else which was vile growing on the bath and tiles. The coridoors were dark and dingy. It was truely appaling. Sleep in a cardboard box on the street instead of staying here, it will be cleaner!!!!!"
25,1665,"Jan 29 2007 	BEWARE OF SCAM!!!!	PLEASE, Anyone planning to book with this hotel should be very cautious. My family and I just returned from our trip to India, and this hotel is overbooking people and then transfering them to smaller, 0 star hotels in the vicinity (they have special arrangements with them). We were lied to by both the manager and the co-owner of the hotel and after two days of fighting, squabling and hell, we finally never got our room. They even promised to keep our suitcases and after our day out on the town, we'd return to our rooms......alas, nothing, they then said we're sorry but the hotel is full (second night in a row) - anyways, i could tell you all the details, but please just take my advice and avoid this hotel and its sleezy partners in the area (Perfect Hotel &amp; Crest Inn). If you'd like to have a chat with me about the experience, drop me a line at travel@astralize.com. Cheers, SameerLondon, UK."
26,1665,"Jan 8 2007 	Good Value	We stumbled across the hotel trying to look for a Travel Agents, we were introduced to a man called Muztapher at the Regent who arranges Flights, cars whatever you want, from that point our holiday started, we had an amazing trip. We had three nights here, the first night the room was dark with no windows and cramped.... but the second time we checked in we asked for a room with a window at the front, the room was much better, ask to see the room before you stay!!! Restaurant Ok, breakfast hectic, staff perfectly helpful if a little slow. rooms clean, fantastic location, Hotel shop a rip off, Muztipher made our trip, with good recomendation, obviously he is making money of tourists thats his job, but we didnt feel he was asking to much, he knows his stuff. We were two young women traveling together, if we needed to be walked anywhere he would send a chaperon with us, drivers were always good, cars mostly clean. The hotel was good value at about 20 a room. Would deffinately go back, felt very safe."
27,1665,"Dec 2 2006 	It is what it is...	My wife and I stayed here last month for 4 nights. The rooms are not great, the bathrooms are awful, but we spent minimal time in our room and only stayed in our room to sleep. There are much better options in New Delhi, however, they are way more expensive. I probably would not stay there again and it definately is not a 3 star hotel."
28,1665,"Nov 27 2006	not a 3-star hotel at all	We had booked the hotel on recommendation by a Delhi travel agent against our will, as they told us it is in a super location and a good hotel where everybody they booked there has been satisfied. We have not been! We stayed there twice in tiny rooms with small windows opening to the next wall. You can not leave them open, as around there all outlefts from AC in other rooms. One room was in the reach of strolling cats. The rooms were dumpy, even with the AC on and had a bad smell. Room and bathroom were basic and not clean. The hotel had school children, a noisy clientele. The restaurant was rather expensive for what it offered. Room service was long and did spoil the content with opening bottle, without even thinking of cleaning it up. The location is not that good, in a unlit road, when you step our ot the door, you are &quot;attacked&quot; ba various people wanting something from you. We would never go back there again."
29,1665,Nov 21 2006 	disappointing	Overall we found the service and facilities of the hotel adequate. The big problem was the rooms. We stayed in this hotel twice during one trip to India and both rooms we found to be very dark (no windows) and small. The bathrooms very very dirty. We also had to share the one room with numerous cockroaches. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
30,1665,"Oct 7 2006 	incompetent staff	I stayed here for 5 nights in early september. The location is average, hidden down a back alley but not too far from the excellent metro system. Whilst the communal areas were clean and well kept I found the room to be very spartan and it was only cleaned twice during my stay. The &quot;colour&quot; TV was particulary bad quality and virtually unwatchable.The room service was good, the wait was not too long and the food was of an acceptable standard, as was the price.However, my biggest gripe was the level of service provided by the staff. It took them 2 hours to finalise my bill when I came to check out and they then charged me more than I was originally quoted. (hint - if you can get a print of their original quote then take it with you. I didn't and was charged an extra 90 when I checked out).There is no money changing facility at the hotel but when I enquired one of the porters took me to a local money changer - who tried to short change me to the tune of 900rps.I also gave the staff a couple of postcards to put in the mail for me - 4 weeks later and they still havn't arrived! I doubt they got round to posting them....."
31,1665,Dec 30 2005	Disliked the Regent	On arrival a staff member tried to downgrade us from a double regent suite to a classic deluxe room because they wanted to charge more for the suite even though we had agreed on a price. They showed us the classic room which had a cat living in it. We demanded the original room at the set price and they gave it to us without further quibble. Room service was awful as they brought things we didn't order and charged us for things we didn't order though management rectified this after complaining about it. The room itself was large and clean with hot water on tap and a television with good reception. Travel desk was very helpful and during our stay the hotel staff tried to be as helpful as possible and we didn't run into any problems paying them at the end. The taxi I arranged with the travel desk to the airport was also set at a fair price and I didn't feel ripped off. I didn't make use of the restaurant because of their questionable room service but found other restaurants within walkind distance as a replacement. It's definately a budget hotel but I wouldn't recommend it.
32,1665,"Dec 11 2005	Never again. . .	We recently stayed at the Regent Continental Hotel in New Delhi after booking online having read a good review. We experienced many problems. Service from staff at reception was poor - promises made to do things were not fulfilled. Pressure was put on us to use expensive hotel taxis instead of reliable local transport. We were not able to successfully make phone calls from our room. The bathroom had a bug infestation. The complimentary breakfast consisted of four or five plates of things like bread, curd and filled parathas - which is fine on the surface - but the food was almost inedible and led to one of us getting sick. We attempted to book a taxi through the hotel for our departure and found at the last minute that they had not done it and we had to go in the hotel car which was far more expensive to do. The room itself was ok. The TV worked and power cuts were minimal. The location was also good. But overall our experience was a very negative one. We certainly wouldn't recommend that any women travelling alone book themselves into this hotel."
33,1665,"May 24 2005	Loved the Regent	My room was large, open and spacious with a balcony, refrigerator, large beds and a nice large bath room. The hotel staff went out of their way to be accommodating and all were so kind and friendly. There is a travel desk in the lobby and Mr. Ahmed will do everything from make your plane or train reservations to arrange tours or just get a car and driver to take you shopping. There is a lovely gift shop in the large, white marble lobby. The restaurant serves a good complimentary breakfast and has a nice menu of Chinese and Indian foods. Mineral water is available there also. There was never a problem of running out of hot water for showers at any time of the day or night and the hotel has a good back up system for the frequent power failures. Their laundry service is fast and efficient. Room service is available 24 hours a day and food is reasonably priced. This was my first trip to Delhi but if I have an opportunity to return it will definitely be to the same place. I spent 8 days there and would recommend the Hotel Regent Continental to anyone. I would also like to thank each member of the staff for making my stay in India so very enjoyable."

1,1668,"Oct 5 2009 	Not bad	The best thing about hotel Singh Sahib is its location very near to the Karol Bagh main market and metro station. This was my only criteria to book this hotel.Apart from location, this place has nothing much to offer. The staff was untrained and sounded a bit fishy. The rooms were small and bathroom even smaller. Its located in a semi-residential area and initially I had problems in locating the place. This place is only recommended for individual stay for 1-2 days in Delhi."
2,1668,"Apr 30 2009 	Ideal location in KarolBagh with posh Interiors	About the Hotel : I got to know about this hotel through my freinds who had stayed there before. I was looking for an ideal place to stay thats not too expensive (within 2K INR per double room) and at the same time nearby shopping areas of Delhi. Rooms with good interirors are always my choice when it comes to staying with family. This hotel excelled my expectations interms of interiors.Location : This is very near to the famous Karol Bagh market. Its a five minute walk to the shopping area. The hotel is located in a nearby side lane thats not too posh. The metro station is about 15 minute walk or rs 20 by auto. Food : The room service did take sometime but the food was of good quality. There is NO complimentary breakfast in this hotel. Service : The room boys had a smile on them when they attended to us and the reception desk was always ready to offer help. I would say that overall they were very helpful and courteous.In a nutshell: If you travelling with family or on business and looking for a hotel with excellant interiors and a convenient location , then this hotel will be one of my recommendations..."
3,1668,"Feb 8 2009 	Don't bother	I would highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel when you're in Delhi. It was our very first stop after flying in and probably the least welcoming hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff were rude and always yelled at each other, with the noise echoing right up the stairwell. Our room was tiny and dark, with no window and an overflowing toilet. We asked for the toilet to be fixed and someone came in and did something to it then demanded a tip, even though the toilet was clearly not fixed. The staff also tried to overcharge us for food and drinks that we had, claiming that the menu listed an incorrect price. We had no hot water and no room to move and couldn't wait to get out of there. Karol Bagh, though quite interesting, is not a good area to stay in as it's hard to get around and takes awhile to get anywhere. There are also lots of hotels in the area and no auto rickshaw driver ever knew where we wanted to go, so of course they tried to just drop us off elsewhere. On our way back through Delhi we stayed at the Eleven guesthouse, which cost a bit more but not that much and it managed to completely restore our faith in Delhi being a good place to visit. Steer clear of the Singh Sahib."
4,1668,"Mar 3 2008	Stay somewhere else	By the second night, we were calling this the &quot;Hotel Suck Sahib.&quot; It's dirty, it's noisy, and it's located in a crappy area with nothing interesting to do and a long tuk-tuk ride between you and anything worthwhile. After every excursion, we had trouble getting back to the hotel because none of the tuk-tuk drivers could find it, even with the hotel's card and map. It took an average of four stops for directions to actually find the place.If you absolutely must stay here, at all costs avoid room T-2. It's on the top floor and shares a wall with the kitchen, which means you will hear chopping, clanging, and crashing all night long, in addition to the loud voices and radio of the kitchen staff. It's marginally quieter on other floors (unless the staff starts moving furniture at 4 am, which happened during our stay), but the rooms are still dirty and uncomfortable. If you're going to stay in a crummy budget hotel, at least make it somewhere more conveniently located than this dump."
5,1668,"Jan 17 2008 	Small room and no opening window	Location of the hotel is pretty near the sky train station. The room is quite small. There is no chair inside the room. The window does not open. Air ventilation is bad. Luckily the ceiling fan was working ok. We had to wait about 10 mins. to get the hot shower. At the time we stayed, there was no restaurant in the hotel. The mangement said it was being renovated. We were served american breakfast at our room for 100 rp. But the breakfast was rather bad. The toast was hard. Coffe was only warm."
6,1668,"Dec 25 2007 	Not bad could be better	We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in December. The hotel is a midrange hotel ( paid Rs. 2200). Our room was clean and spacious enough to accomodate our family of two adults and one child on the bed (although we thought the bed could have been a bit longer to accomodate our feet as well..:)..) and had room for an extra bed. The bathroom was clean and had running hot water, a necessity during this part of the year in Delhi. They were willing to provide in-room service for the items on their menu while the in-house restaurant was being planned. We had breakfast in the (Bikanerwala) Angan restaurant nearby and ate a very reasonably priced fresh local Indian meal . There was also a good travel agent in the neighborhood from whom we hired a taxi for local Delhi sightseeing for a day.Pros: Courteous staff, good location, clean room and bathroom; Cons: Very poor noise insulation, from our hotel rooms (on the first and second floor) could hear noise in the corridor and the reception (which is why I am rating this hotel average)"
7,1668,"Dec 14 2007	Very nice new hotel in Karol Bagh	(Our stay December 2007)We walked out on the lousy Hotel Metro Heights. We packed our stuff and walked right next door to the Singh Sahib hotel. I think my Indian friend was learning by now as he said that the Singh Sahib was a little more money and all they had left was a suite, but that was OK as it was more important that we were comfortable where we stayed.In the Singh Sahib, we were placed in a suite on the 1st floor right behind check in. It appeared that the hotel looked new and they were still renovating a little. The restaurant was still not complete. However, the room was large and clean and new and had a working AC. It also did not reek of cigarettes. Unfortunately Im not sure how long it will stay that way as the hotel apparently appeals to smokers. I chastised a Chinese guest stepping off the elevator with a lit cigarette and his response was that there was no sign. I was sure that not smoking in an elevator was a universal courtesy?As I said, the room was new, cleanly marbled and freshly painted. As nice as it was there still were some quirky problems. First, although everything appeared clean, the workers neglected to clean the walls around the toilet, just a small oversight. Also, they had a cheap temporary curtain that went across the bathroom covering the shower and tub. This we found was prone to come down easily. There was hot water, but it took a while to show up. There were frequent electricity outages, but only for a minute or two.The soaps were the best quality we found during our travels in India. They brought extra towels on request. There was no mini bar in the room. Breakfast was included but because the restaurant was closed, we had to order by room service. There was a small glitch in getting the food, but it finally came. We had to then ask for silverware and napkins. We were surprised to find French toast on the menu, but it came plain and they offered no syrup. We went to compliment the front desk and apparent owners on the quality of the hotel and rooms. We were told that they must have the cheap curtains in the bathrooms as the Indian guests bathe with the bucket and cup, splashing the water over their bodies to rinse and in the process drench the room. They really were not interested in talking to me. When I asked to take a couple of pictures of another room to post on TA, they refused and handed me a pamphlet saying I could see the pictures there.The one thing that really upset me about this hotel was the scam the owners appeared to be playing on their guests. Im not sure if it actually hurt the guests, but it was probably more to shield their income from the government. I watched as they appeared to overcharge one of the Chinese guests checking out. She was tough and those guys were not going to get one over on her. When she asked for a receipt, they tried to talk around the subject, and finally went to write a receipt on a piece of note paper. The girl insisted on an official invoice and they finally succumb. It was funny when she asked why they had to play all of these games for which they replied with a sly meekish smile. Unfortunately I still think they were up to something as they gave her the original and kept the copy receipt. I did not realize they did the same thing to my travel agent friend who paid the bill for me. When I was later telling him about the Chinese girl, we looked at our receipt and found they had done the same thing to him. We went back later to reclaim our bags being held for us after check out, and made them give us a proper invoice.Again this place is right next door to the Hotel Metro Heights. Both have front desk people that are plenty rough around the edges, but the Singh Sahib is ten times better. The Singh Sahib maybe a bit more expensive and the rooms may be a bit smaller, but for the few extra dollars I'd stay here and not ruin my vacation at the Metro Heights. Just make sure to ask for an official receipt when you leave."
1,1671,economical rooms 	The property was very convenient and my stay was smooth. Room was clean and service was perfect. I didn't take any meal but morning breakfast was hygienic and tasteful. Thought i took the dinner &amp; it was great . Location was also decent one. I will definitely visit this hotel whenever I planned to come back here again.
2,1671,"France love India	This was my first visit to India. One of my friend suggested me to take a stay in this hotel.I booked the suit room through internet. Hotel arranged complimentary airport pickup for me. They gave me a very classy service,the room was very neat and clean,mini bar had all the things which i needed,the restaurant was good and the food was awesome. The interior of the room was really very good and it gave me a positive attitude. The staff of the hotel was well trained and gave me a good service. I also enjoyed the internet service but the only drawback was the location of the hotel i.e. karol bagh area was very crowded. Despite of all the drawbacks about the area i really enjoyed my stay.I would like to thank the hotel staff for cooperating with me and giving me the good service and my special thanks goes especially to the front office of the hotel for not charging for the printouts which i had taken from the hotel computer."

The service is excellent but the food is average. Will definately stay at the hotel when I visit Delhi . Also I will recommend my friends to book through hotel directly . Hotel has a nice website and can book online directly.
5,1671,Nov 26 2009 	godloveshuman	A Perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour . Overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful. so much so that at times you feel you are unnecessarily taking advantage of their nature just because you want to experience the Royal feeling which the staff wants you to experience. It was a perfect stay.Kamal Bhagat
6,1671,"Nov 25 2009 	TheGamePlay	The hotel room was very good with modern outfit. Though room was spacious, its more than made up with modern amenities and good lighting. The front office was also very cordial and well staffed. The restaurant was not very good. The food was upto standard. The bath room was good . House keeping made sure small things are refilled everyday !"
7,1671,"Nov 21 2009 	What you see and what you get are both good!	As a female travelling alone, I found the neighborhood a little destitute, but the hotel was perfect for the price and just around the corner from bustling activity, shops, traffic and typical Delhi hustle and bustle. The staff was eager to help and very warm and friendly. The room was very spacious; the only drawback is that the shower is not in a separate stall so water sprays over the floor of the bathroom. All in all, a good value, very clean, lots of little packages of necessities. I would recommend this as a decent budget hotel."

9,1671,Oct 24 2009 	Good value hotel in a good location	This hotel is situated in a market. Good area to stay in as it is a local indian area and hassle free. Good shopping close by. Small hotel but friendly. Staff were helpful.
10,1671,"Oct 21 2009 	Cheap but not really clean	The hotel is cheap, located in an area with a lot of garages and car trading activities. We were upgraded for free - but the room we were upgraded to did not even have a window! Sheets and towels were partly dirty - so this was not a cosy place to stay.The personell is very friendly tough, we were instantly given another room when asking. All in all it is not really a recommendable hotel, but we had expected something like that."

15,1671,"Oct 1 2009 	Worst place to stay	I was forced to stay in this hotel as i was coming from Manali with a small 4 year old child at 6.30 am.I checked into this hotel.The room rents are far too high for the amenities.The bed is placed on a carpet which has not been cleaned in the last one year.The hotel staff must rank as the most unfriendly and rude that I have encountered.They insisted i pay in cash or pay 2% more if I payed by card.They insisted that I pay more as i was checking in at 6.30 am in the morning.Hioweevr if you fight they would reluctently agree to not charge you anything extra.If you wanted an extra tea bag , I had to fight for it."
16,1671,"Sep 29 2009 	Average	Average hotel in the busy Carol Bagh area.Not much to describe about except that you cant find another 3 star hotel in Delhi city for this value.The restaurant is not that great and the food too was just OK.Overall, only advisable if you dont have any other option except stay in Carol Bagh....Which ofcourse is a street shoppers paradise."
17,1671,"Sep 6 2009 	Loved the hospitality	I was at this hotel with my parents from Feb 3, 09 - Feb 7, 09. We had travelled from Fiji Islands.The most fantastic thing about this hotel is the hospitality. The staff, even the management were so helpful. We ran into some emergency and I was amazed at the way we were helped out, especially by the management. Another great thing we liked about this hotel was the location. It is right in the middle of Karol Bagh and accessible to the main shopping areas. We really enjoyed our stay here."
18,1671,Aug 31 2009 	we enjoyed it	Sri Nanak is definitely one of the best 3 star properties in Delhi. The hotel room &amp; the food was excellent. It was a perfect stay.
19,1671,"Aug 29 2009 	very nice stay	The hotel is perfect for a stay in Delhi We received a warm welcome from the hotel management. We were given a nice room. The room was spacious and well furnished. In fact, we are thankful to the hotel management because they upgraded our room without any extra cost. The bathrooms were very clean . There was bath tub, and also separate shower panels which we enjoyed the most. We were also given complimentary soft beverages and free laundry service. The restaurants served delicious food. I would certainly recommend this hotel to all travelers in Delhi ."
20,1671,"Aug 29 2009 	Better stay away	Sri Nanak Continental is situated in a rather shabby neighbourhood in New Delhi.We stayed in four different hotels on our trip, and Sri Nanak was by far the worst.We had booked a &quot;luxury room&quot;.- The room did not feature a safe (which was said to be included).- The A/C was old and very noisy, and it was not possible to leave it on when removing the room key to go out, making the room as hot as outside (+40 c).The staff tried to scam us when we asked for a hotel taxi to the local market. It was just a couple of blocks away, and they wanted Rs. 1500 (!!). When we declined the offer and left, they hurried back to us and offered a four hour sightseeing for rp.800 (which still is pretty expensive).We went to see some other parts of India, and left the hotel for five days. We asked to check out and get refund for the this period. The staff declined the refund, but wanted us badly to check out. We did not check out, as we needed the room for storage. So, in the meantime, while checked in, the staff removed our belongings from the hotel room and unplugged the refridgerator. When we got back, we had to ask the staff to get our stuff back. They had most likely rented our room out when we were gone. Very unprofessional!Positive remarks:- The hotel gave us free airport pick up.- They gave us three hour free internet access.- Liqour shop situated next to the hotel.- The food in the restaurant (other than the continental breakfast) was OK.Note:The internet at the hotel must be authenticated through a web frontend. This page does not work with Opera Mini or the standard Nokia web browser.Summary:Unprofessional and dubious staff. Stay away from this hotel."
21,1671,"Aug 22 2009 	Pretty poor might be ok value for money.	Me and some friends stayed at this hotel when visiting India recently and here are my impressions:Rooms: Size is somewhat small, but in my opinion not really that bad. The main room seemed clean enough, but the bathroom was a disaster. A very dirty floor, somewhat smelly, and stains in the toilet (not excrements, but the kind you get if you never clean it). Towels and bedsheets were clean.Hygene supplies like soap, shampoo, shaver, shower scrub and tooth brush/paste were all included, but the empty/used ones wasn't always replaced unless we asked for it.Air Condition machines were noisy but worked ok.Staff: Rather unfriendly and not too service-minded. They also seemed very helpless when it came to things that are not in their daily routine. For example, when cheking out, they insisted my card was being declined. When I looked at the display on the card reader it said &quot;check phone no&quot;. I told them that it was probably not a card problem, but a connection problem, yet they insisted it was my card that didn't work and demanded I go get some cash. After some nagging, I got them to wiggle a bit on the phone connector, and hey presto, it worked.As usual, when checking out, you have to fight the staff to roll your own suitcase yourself the three meters from your room to the lift. If they get to you they'll also cram themselves together with you and your luggage in the already small elevator, not matter how much you tell them you can do it yourself. Totally unnecessary in my opinion. No tip!When we asked the hotel taxi for a 8 km ride they wanted 1500 rupees. We just turned our back to leave, and suddenly we got a better (not good, but better) deal. (Four hours free driving for 800 rs) Dissapointing that they first tried to hustle us like that.The two friends I traveled with had prepaid their room, and when we went for a unplanned trip we told the staff we would leave for a few days. As my friends could not get a refund (the staff didn't even want to try, they just repeated &quot;not refundable as in the agreement&quot;) my friends didn't check out for the small trip. When we came back, their belongings were removed from their room. Though they got them back, it seems the room was rented out in the meantime.Food: The best thing about the hotel. The restaurant has some great Indian dishes. But stay away from the continental breakfast!Internet: Provided by wifi, but unfortunately user authorized by a somewhat dodgy web solution that doesn't work in all browsers, so you might not be able to use your smart phone."
22,1671,"Aug 13 2009 	Poor organization	I went to India with my wife for sightseen, this country has many things to see and Taj Mahal is defenitively the best of the seven wonders. We were hosted in Hotel Sri Nanak Continental and from my point of view this hotel has a weak organization.We had the next problems due poor organization1.- I requested pick up service in the airport, we were waiting for 30 minutes, and taxi never arrives, finally we decided to go by ourself to hotel.2.- Even though there is a questionaire to feed back about problems with infrastructure and service, it seem they didnt read it, air conditioner is very noisy, almost impossible to sleep, but with a temperature in summer of 40C obviously is necessary3.- Room cleaning can be drastically improved.4.- We bought a 3 days-tour to Agra and Jaipur in travel desk of same hotel, I explained them due we were not using the room during 2 nights I must not pay this, but responsible explained me this is a hotel policy and that I had to pay this 2 nights and additional hotel in Agra and Jaipur. 5.- The street is very noisy and rooms are not designed to have a quiet enviroment.I recommend to look for different option, there are better hotels in Delhi at same price."
23,1671,"Jul 20 2009 	Horrible horrible place-will not stay here ever again!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. My husband booked this place because it was shown as a top value hotel on Trip advisor! the location is not that great. but that was not our main problem. when we arrived at the hotel after a long flight, the staff were very rude and extremely lazy.. hey took about half hour to check us in and the service was really really bad. finally we were taken to the room. It is extremely small. Although they had provided a big collection of supplies for bathroom etc. I was impressed with the LCD TV bcos overally the hotel looked quite horrible! The bathroom was the worst. It smelt of cigarettes and I was not sure if they had actually cleaned the bathrooms before we arrived. Five minutes after we checked into the hotel, we were asked to come down to the reception with our passports. As we were planning to go and watch a movie, my husband and I went downstairs. We were met by two police officers in civil clothes. They started asking us many questions as to where we work etc. We were questioned for a good ten minutes. They became very nice to us after they found out where my husband and I were working and apologised to us. When we asked why they wanted to question us they told us that it was arountine checking as the indian independance day was coming soon, that we were the only guests in our rooms and because we were originally from a south asian country! I was quite angry, even thought the police officers were eventually very nice to us. we had no idea why they wanted to check us and we were quite suspicious because both the police officers who had come to check us spoke our mother tongue which is not that often used in north india.. what made us even more angrier was that the front office staff did not even apologise to us or even explain why were being questioned.. My husband and I have stayed in many places as we go on holidays once a month and this hotel was the worst that I had stayed in.. My husband and I actually had an argguement because I was complaining the whole evening about this hotel :).. I have no idea why this hotel is shown as a top value hotel in trip advisor as there are many many more nicer hotels. I will not stay here again and I will not recommend it to anyone!!"

25,1671,"May 27 2009 	Nice experience....	The hotel &amp; services were very much helpfull to me as I was the first time visitor to Delhi. I felt very easy to move to see various places in and around Delhi. They had a very good trip assistance, loyal drivers with cab took me to Haridwar+ Rishikesh+ Tajmahal.Rooms &amp; Services were satisfactory."
26,1671,"May 20 2009 	AVOID !!! DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL	The room was very small and unpleasent. Very DIRTY. Unable to sleep due to a loud noise from the street till 4 am. No hot water at bathroom. On arrival we were told that breakfast is included, but on checkout we charged 600 rhp for breakfast. The breakfast was very poor, and the service poor as well. The train station is about 10 minutes walk, in an unpleasant area. The hotel location is faraway from the tourists' attraction, and the area don't look safe at evening time. The A/C was very noisy, and hardly worked, so the room was hot.It was the worst hotel we had in India. I would not stay there again. I do NOT recommend this hotel. It was a very bad experience. I can not understand the other review."
27,1671,"May 3 2009 	Overall stay was unpleasant though some staff were nice.	I only stayed for one night and left quickly the next morning to tour a bit of Delhi and catch a train to Agra in the afternoon. The rooms were ok, but not very clean. My towels were dirty and phone didn't work, so I had to move rooms right away. I can't say much about the location as I didn't explore much, but it is on a very busy narrow street filled with mopeds, fruit stands, and liveliness. Wouldn't recommend walking around solo after dusk but if you are 2 or more, you'd probably be ok. FYI -Breakfast was not included since I booked online. I would not stay there again or recommend this hotel.Additionally - When I arrived, I coordinated a car for the next day which was a bit of an ordeal, but worked out fine. Just beware of the 80 kilometer limit, which I exceeded easily (they charge 7 rupees each additional kilometer - which I actually don't think is terrible, just that you will like go over the limit.) Also, the driver tried to tack on an extra 20 more for not dropping me off back at the hotel or something, even though I had arranged to end the day at the train station. That was annoying and obviously not well communicated."
28,1671,"Mar 12 2009 	brilliant service	we had a short stay at this hotel and would fully recommend it to anyone. The train station is very near and in the middle of a vibrant area.

30,1671,"Feb 5 2009 	Unlikely to go back	For me, getting a good nights sleep and having good washing facilities are the most important reasons for staying in a hotel. Sadly this hotel failed on both counts. The room was tiny with old style A.C. unit which allowed all the outside noise to come through, making it impossible to sleep. The shower had a very poor water flow, not enough have a decent wash. And if you arrive early, like we did, they will charge you for an extra night. If you want to stay up all night and go without a wash, be their guest. Definitely not for us again."
31,1671,"Jan 12 2009 	Much More than Expected	We being an old couple wanted a neat room &amp; a secure place to stay. After spending numerous hours searching for the hotel on the internet we decided to stay at Sri Nanak. There are endless options in the internet but you realize the difference only when you arrive at the hotel .We had booked the hotel directly to get a good deal, and the reply was prompt . We stayed in a executive room which was a newly renovated rooms &amp; later upgraded us to a suite room since they had empty rooms which was a nice gesture. It had nice LCD TV and very clean white linen which is uncommon for hotels in delhi in this price bracket. Rooms had all things which you can expect from a 4 * hotel. We were satisfied with the staff who helped us at all times. Also the hotel has a travel desk in which we went for a same day agra tour * delhi local tour which all went perfect. Overall i would like to recommend this hotel to all travelers as I like sharing my opinion so that others can benefit.Also the hotel Wi-Fi Service was very fast &amp; the best part it was free. They also have a desktop machines in case you do not have a laptop . &quot;&quot;"
32,1671,"Jan 11 2009 	Family Traveller44	This was my first visit to New Delhi, I always book my hotel through Travel Agent but this time I book my hotel through internet. As I have seen many reviews in trip-advisor about this hotel so we decide to stay in this hotel &amp; book a room through the hotel website. I requested the hotel to give me the discount but they refuse to give me the discount and they offer me Free Airport pickup with complimentary breakfast. So we finally decide to book this hotel. The hotel arranged nice luxury car to pickup my family as I was coming from Singapore late night. The hotel was located in crowded area Karol Bagh so we feel safe there to stay. Hotel Sri Nanak was nice, clean &amp; comfortable as my daughter is very particular about the cleanliness of the bathroom but she was happy as there was shower panel in the bathroom with 6 nozzles as never expected in such kind of hotels. The hotel room was small but they have all facilities which we can never think in small luxury hotel as I have stayed in many hotels in India. I will recommend other family travelers to stay in this hotel as the atmosphere of the hotel looks like home."
33,1671,"Dec 30 2008 	Very Noisy Overpriced	Stayed for a night. The room was very noisy for 2 reasons:1. A/C was rumbling like it was about the explode. Had to switch it off eventually because I got really worried. 2. There was some night-long celebration where there was chanting/singing in the street outside (not the Hotel's fault, but still makes it difficult to sleep).Free wireless internet was good. They also give free newspapers which I did not expect from a budget hotel. Hotel staff were also reasonably helpful. While no complaints apart from the noise, the overall hotel service is not spectacular either to merit the price they are charging for."
34,1671,"Dec 29 2008 	Mediocre but Manageable	Our room was incredibly small, and a bit dingy. Staff was nice, though, and the breakfasts were good. The &quot;aloo parata&quot; was the best we had in India."

37,1671,"Dec 9 2008	No problems but overpriced	I stayed here three nights and had absolutely no problems, but the price of 2590 rupees is simply too high for this kind of accommodation. You can get a similar room at Cottage Yes Please for 900/night (and I would have done so, except Yes Please was full at that time). The only real difference in service and quality that I can think of was that Sri Nanak left a newspaper outside my door every morning.The location is a bit noisy. There is a Gurudwara down the street and they broadcast prayers quite loudly at certain times during the day and evening. All around the hotel there are automotive-type shops with lots of motorbikes and the place is really grimy, especially the air. You can see the haze in the air just looking down the street.The main reason I paid this much was for the free WiFi, which I needed for my work. But there are probably other, cheaper options available."
38,1671,"Dec 2 2008 	Great stay	We had very nice time at this hotel,Rooms, staff , internet , clealiness all was very good, we very much enjoyed our stay."
39,1671,"Nov 16 2008 	Mixed Feelings	Staying at the Sri Nanak Continental for two nights on my first trip to Delhi, I cannot compare it to other accomodations - but you get the impression that the prices of all mid-range hotels are somehow inflated. The good thing about the Hotel is the rather quiet location (at least for the Karol Bagh district). Most taxi drivers will have to ask a couple of times (and may not be able to read the hotel sign or the address on your reservation...). The room was more less clean, but a strange selection of new and old (well used) furniture. The rooms seem to differ very much, some with new flat screen TVs and bathrooms, some with quite old installations.The rooftop restaurant produced surprisingly good dishes, though the ordering process revealed some communication problems now and then.The check in took quite long, Minibar and Taxi had to be paid in cash. The service was efficient, however, and wakeup call and ordered taxi were on time. The hotel also offers to store some luggage, e.g. if you leave for a round trip for a couple of days."
40,1671,"Nov 8 2008 	Not impressed I'm afraid	I have to say I was not at all impressed with having paid nearly $200 for 2 nights in this hotel.When I arrived my room was not clean, there were gecko droppings in the bathroom, the sheets were dusty, half a bottle of the previous occupant's shampoo was in the room, the kettle did not work and there were the remnants of the previous sachets of coffee from the last occupant, but no replacement sachets. The milk powder sachets were also 8 months past the 'best before' date and it is recommended not to drink them after this date.The following day (today) I had to make many requests - for replacement sachets of coffee, for a new kettle and, when no one had come to clean my room by the afternoon, I requested it was cleaned. This was done quite reluctantly. I still received no replacement coffee sachets.The staff were very polite and have good manners and the reception desk were very helpful in providing me with maps, information re shops and other matters.However, there does need to be some improvement in the management of the hotel domestic standards. They are not what I would expect from a 3 star Hotel.If I had paid $30 per night and this hotel was either a 1 or 0 star, I would have been happy, as it comes under the no frills budget category. However, it is far far removed from the advert on the site and not worth the amount of money I spent on it."
41,1671,Oct 1 2008 	not a good place	The worst hotel we stayed in India. The staff was not friendly at all.When we asked to pay in euros they tried to cheat us in calculating the chage rates...The room was dirty and we had to keep close the bathroom door due to the smell...The resturant is fine even if the service was very slow.
42,1671,"Sep 5 2008 	Great budget place but beware of the tourist operators attahced to the hotel	If you are looking for a good budget hotel then Nanak is a great choice in Delhi. It's location is not the best, especially since it is tucked into a narrow street which was not really car-friendly. Service at the hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean but the bathroom shower curtains could be better. The food at the restaurant was good and we had no complaints. My only complaint during the duration of our stay was the travel agency attached to the hotel. They were ridiculously overpriced, and the drivers who took us back to New Delhi railway station were outright impolite and did not care about the fact that it was raining and that we did not want to wade in a pool of water to get to the entrance of the station. All they were worried about was that we had to pay Rs. 100 more for the A/C. On the second day of our stay we took a tour of Delhi and the driver was reluctant to take us to many places saying that it was too crowded. It looked like we were traveling with his comfort in mind.PLEASE BEWARE ABOUT THESE TOURIST OPERATORS. You would be better off if you can arrange your Delhi tours with another travel agency. I called Mr. Karan Khandelwal of the hotel and he promised to look into this matter and was very apologetic but I never got a call back or an email regarding this. Overall the hotel was a pleasant experience with the only blot being the tourist operators. I would recommend the place otherwise."
43,1671,"Aug 12 2008 	Would recommend it 	Enroute home I had some dead time in Delhi on August 1. As I was travelling with two young kids, some decent lodging to have a nap and shower, was imperative. I booked this hotel by directly contacting the property through email. They offered me a room for INR 1500 for 8 hours, everything included except transfer. I thought INR 1500 was not a bad deal and thus consented to the offer. The room was clean and worth its price. Bathroom was of good standard to be a budget hotel in India, toiletries of acceptable quality. Wifi was ok. As far as location is considered, it all depends upon what you are looking for. If you are out to enjoy the true hustle bustle of India, it is a perfect choice  congested, mainstream India with all its salient features. But if you are allergic of crowd, hullaballoo and wanted to have something silent and calm, avoid this hotel  rather avoid the locality Karol Bagh altogether. The hotel asks for INR 700 for a taxi to the airport, which is quite unreasonable. Air-conditioned radio taxi would cost at the most INR 450. Of course, there are much better alternatives. However, in short, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking something in this price class. A general tip: Try as far as practically possible, have your deals in writing, explicitly mentioning what it includes and what it doesnt. Otherwise, you will be bitterly surprised at the end."
44,1671,"Jul 19 2008 	A Nice Budget Alternative	First of all, it should be clear to visitors that we are talking about budget alternative not a property in luxury segment. Thus, it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect everything at its best. Taking the rates in account I would say  1. Hotel rooms are adequately clean. 2. Toilet/bathroom = above average3. Maharaja suit could be a nice option for families travelling with young kids and tight budget. Location is not the ideal one  but not that bad either. Conclusion: Honestly speaking Sri Nanak deserves better rating than the one it currently holds (27)."
45,1671,"Jun 30 2008 	Cosy Little Hotel	The Sri Nanak is a cozy place in a busy Delhi location. It's not within walking distance of much, but you'll feel like you're in real Delhi.We stayed here twice, and had a different room each time. The two rooms we had were both comfortable and clean, but one room was definitely more recently renovated in than the other.On Christmas Day, we were treated to a free simple dinner in the restaurant upstairs.Practicalities:Free internet access from a computer terminal. There are small grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants nearby. The hotel staff is courteous and responsive to needs. The hotel also felt safe. Get detailed instructions on how to get to the hotel because taxi drivers seem to have difficulty finding it. Overall, great for the price."
46,1671,"Jun 11 2008 	Comfortable Stay	Though I stayed at the hotel just for a night, I found the hotel very comfortable and peaceful. The interior of the hotel room was very good. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, Karol Bagh. The staff was very co-operative and helpful. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends."
47,1671,"Apr 26 2008 	Excellent Stay	I stayed with Hotel Sri Nanak in March 08. The hotel was great, the services was just too great. The Owner sandeep was great too, he had a dinner with us and that was complimentary. The Manager were very helpful in providing information about the city which was quite handy ! We had our Laptops , we could browse High Speed Wi-Fi which was quite useful . Also if you are not carrying the notebook then the hotel provides free access to desktops. The Food at the restaurant was great serving excellent chicken tikka masala (I like spicy food). The food was just too good to resist! The rooms have been nicely decorated &amp; very clean. The bathroom was equipped with latest amenities and the rooms were just amazing. There is a nicely decorated lobby in the basement where you can shop too. I bought a lovely pair of elephants. Over all my stay at the hotel was great &amp; it's a good deal to be here! If you are in Delhi, grab a room here.Happy traveling to all!"
48,1671,"Apr 22 2008 	clean cheap free wi-fi	The hotel offered to pick me up from the airport, for 800 Rupees. I arranged a taxi at the airport for 250 Rupees, but took the driver a long time to find the hotel. I would recommend you have a map and give the driver directions.The location is a few minutes walk from several lively street markets and the metro station is within 10 minutes walk.The room was small, basically furnished and reasonably clean. The staff are very helpful.A good value hotel for Delhi."
49,1671,"Apr 20 2008 	Excellent location grat staff	I chose Sri Nanak hotel for 2 reasons: the location (it is nearby the place I needed to go to for business) and the reviews about the staff. When in a new city it is always best to have reliable local information. My expections were infact exceeded.The hotel is clean and provides a more than average service for the Indian standards of a 3 star. But the people at the reception were outstanding. They helped me organize my days in such a way that I managed to perfectly combine busines and tourism. Transport was just perfect, including the pick up at the airport.But a special note is for the restaurant: I had the most enjoyable indian food; not the usual tourist stuff, but authentic indian cuisine in a very friendly environment.I will for sure come back the next times I will be in Delhi."
50,1671,"Apr 14 2008 	Mixed feelings	This was our first trip to India and our first stay in this hotel. To me it bore no resemblance to the lavish reviews I've read on this site, but it was clean and things worked. I was charged 700 rupees for a &quot;complimentary&quot; pickup from the airport, but I must blame myself as I had forgotten that the pickup was supposed to be free. The location is awful, but perhaps the rest of Delhi is like that (we only went from the airport to the hotel and back). There was also some problem with the online reservation payment gateway and if I hadn't checked the total would have paid about twice what I was supposed to. I don't know quite how to rate this hotel as I haven't seen others in Delhi, but I certainly don't think the hotel deserves the praise some reviewers have cast on it."
51,1671,"Apr 12 2008	Good for occasional night's stay	We spent 4 nights, in 2 stays, during March, in different rooms. The rooms are small, with little storage space, but clean, the bed firm but adequate. The air con worked but was noisy, the fridge didn't work. The bathroom is a 'wet room' so take your thongs/flip-flops, but there was hot water. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful. Unless they already know where it is, taxis won't be able to find it - it's buried in the 'motor-cycle repair' section of the bazaar. But they will be able to find the gurdwara: the hotel is very close - if the gurdwara is on your LHS, turn R for 1 block, &amp; vise versa. Alternatively, arrange for the hotel to send a car to meet you at the station or airport. The dining room on the top floor is not very attractive, although an Indian family had a birthday party there - good sign. Be careful of the food - my wife had a dose of salmonella 2 days after we left &amp; is convinced it was from a re-heated veg biryani she had there. In summary, it's OK for an occasional night's stay, if you're prepared to live out of your suitcase, &amp; it's inexpensive. For some reason they wouldn't take a CR card for payment but insisted on cash."
52,1671,"Apr 7 2008 	Great hotel great family	I had an excellent stay at Hotel Sri Nanak. I was in India for one month doing volunteer work and stayed at the hotel the entire time. The family that owns the hotel was very helpful and even gave us a deal because we stayed for such a long time. Anything we needed, they tried their best to get. The power went off about once a day, but luckily, the hotel had a generator that kicked on and kept the air conditioning and lights running. All the staff was very friendly and helped us out with what we needed in terms of directions. Really, this is a comfortable, friendly, Indian run place. They do what they can to make their guests happy and comfortable."
53,1671,"Apr 1 2008 	overpriced for location	My partner and I arrived early in the morning. We had given them details of our flight by email couple of days before but nobody picked us up. Wasn't such a big deal as the pre-paid taxi was handy at the airport.When we arrived, they didn't have any room for us and we believed it might have been some communication problem. We were totally exhausted, so we took their suggestion of staying in their staff's room for a few hours until one of their guests checked out later that morning. Reception guy was very polite, helpful and friendly.Anyway, we believe that for the location and the quality of the suite we stayed, it was overpriced. We stayed our next nights at another hotel in Paharganj, half their price and a little higher quality!I would recommend travellers to stay in Paharganj area, which is very close to metro station, much cheaper and more interesting!"
54,1671,"Mar 31 2008	Very Average Beware of Noise	Picked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. To sum it up, we got what we paid for. The restaurant on top had very average food. The hotel rooms were very average. After reading the reviews, I expected the hotel to be noisy. and it was VERY noisy. I must have woken up 3 or 4 times in the night/early morning. The noise from the street is just insane. Its almost as if there is no glass. As for the staff, they were very helpful and courteous. As for the location, I would not recommend any single women travellers to stay in this hotel. The area isn't bad, but it sure as heck ain't safe. As the manager said, this is the oldest part of New Delhi.In the end, if you want average, this is it."
55,1671,"Feb 19 2008 	Hard to find a good hotel in New Delhi	We booked three rooms and stayed six nights while we were attending a conference in January 2008. Prior to leaving I asked five of the hotels I had previously stayed at (Ashok, Taj Mahal, Oberoi, Meriden, and Claridges) to quote a price for four rooms for six nights, including all taxes, I do not know if it was the time of year but all came back with quotes in excess of $10,000 and one was not sure they could fit us in! If you are looking at the Hotel Sri Nanak Continental you are probably having the same problem, finding a good clean hotel in New Delhi. I use Google Earth and the Hotel Sri Nanak was shown as located in New Delhi close to our meeting at the Dr. Kothari conference center. I sent an email to the hotel to book the rooms and stated that it was selected based on its location. I am a regular visitor to India and know my way around New Delhi although I had not been there in over 10 years. The Hotel Sri Nanak Continental is not in New Delhi but in Old Delhi and its ranking of 22 of 215 hotels in New Delhi is more a reflection of the sever lack of good hotels. As one of our first time visitors to India put it a one star hotel on the fringe of the ghetto he had never seen an Indian ghetto so he is probably overly harsh.The location mistake was not a mistake but I am glad to report that it has now been corrected. India is known for its entrepreneurship and rather than take offense on what appears to be borderline dishonesty it is better to take in your stride and get the problem fixed. The hotel did pick us up at the airport in a good car, the hotel is in a dirty part of town but I believe it to be safe. The trip they arranged for Agra went well and the hotel taxi driver was made to cough up what he overcharged due to lack of change! Finally the grey towels were eventually replaced by clean white towels. One of our party had money stolen from stored luggage despite the security but it is not a good idea to leave money in luggage anywhere in the world.All in all probably somewhat overpriced for the location and condition of the rooms but you may want to consider negotiating and on the up side, despite its basic appearance the restaurant is great.My advice to the owners: Keep your laundry clean and fix up the roof area so guests have somewhere to sit. My advice to guests  welcome to India, keep your cash safe and go with the flow."
56,1671,Feb 13 2008 	Great Presidential room	The presidential suite is amazing! great service and accommodation!
57,1671,"Feb 10 2008	Friendly 	I booked this hotel through internet. We were there for our first business trip. Upon arrival, I was surprised that the check in was still traditional way of recording but with security camera in place. The food is fantastic and the staff is always smiling. The room is clean too. What is important is I have free broadband internet. It's a nice place to rest at the heart of busy shop houses.Alvin, Singapore"
58,1671,"Feb 7 2008 	I didnt like it	After extensive research on the web, Sri Nanak seemed to be the best bet, but I was really disappointed. My biggest problem was that the rooms were really dusty, I was constantly sneezing and wiping my nose. My 2nd gripe was that the bathroom was a disaster. I cant understand why they dont use a separator between the shower and toilet. So the end effect is that after a shower the entire bathroom is wet !. Its a pity... this could be a really decent place if only they took the time to clean it !On the plus side the staff were helpful, although did raise your suspicions sometime. However overall they did help me with train ticket bookings and taxi service. Another plus is that they pick you up from the airport, which is a real help since you will inevitably get ripped off by a local taxi driver. As for location, its a bit run-down, but then thats India for you. Another plus is that its close to the Delhi Metro (which is excellent), and there are some shopping arcades in walking distance."
59,1671,"Jan 26 2008 	Great place to begin and end your journey to India	We traveled to India as a family of six, with four under the age of eighteen. We flew into Delhi and Sri Nanak Hotel was waiting for us - even though our flight was delayed more than two hours in the middle of the night. What service! The hotel staff was friendly, supportive and helped us acclimate from the USA to India. Mr. Sandeep and Mr. Karan were particularly helpful. They made sure all of our needs were addressed. They arranged for transportation to the Taj, to our friend's house in Delhi, and to the airports as we traveled. We came back to this hotel after more than two weeks in country. We stayed in several hotels, and this had the best service, good food, clean accomodations and excellent management and staff. When we come to India in the future this will be our first and last stop. I give Sri Nanak my highest recommendation - a value for the money, and a welcome respite from the busyness of Delhi. Hats off to Mr. Sandeep and Mr. Karan!"
60,1671,"Jan 13 2008 	This is Not a Luxury Hotel It's similar to a Motel 8 in the US	I picked this hotel based on the reviews and the price, but of all of the hotels I stayed at during my month long India trip, I thought this one was the one that I like least. I stayed in the best room they had and did not think that it was worth the price I paid. I'll update my review with pictures when I can get the pics uploaded. The bed was not comfortable and though the linens looked clean. The bathroom was an average hotel in India bathroom (no bathtub, shower with a bucket and a sink and toilet). The location of the hotel was not good. There was constant noise from the street: cats fighting, dogs fighting, cars honking, engines roaring...the pics I have of the street show how unideal the location really is... If the hotel was priced for the best room at $50 USD/per night, I think it would be a fair price. This hotel should definitely not be charging over $100. On a positive note, the staff seemed helpful and the elevator works. Unfortunately, since I didn't stay in other Delhi hotels, I can't recommend others. I did stay in many hotels on the Golden Triangle Route and can recommend those for the review in the those areas."
61,1671,"Dec 22 2007 	Terrible stay away	Ever wonder why this seems to be one of the few places that seems to have plenty of rooms on short notice? It's because they will take your reservation and then move you on to a different hotel of their choice, even if you personally emailed with them to confirm a reservation made via a website.I arrived here after a long haul flight, quite late in the evening only to discover they had moved me to a different hotel. The room there was fine, even though the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water. Moreover it was located in the middle of the motorcycle repair district of a market. I probably do not need to elaborate on the amount of noise large numbers of bikes make in the morning...I very much recommend AGAINST booking a room at this hotel. You won't end up there anyway, and will just have to go through a lot of hasle to get your original booking fee refunded. (evidently, I ended up paying the other hotel)"
62,1671,"Dec 21 2007 	Noisy busy surroundings	Hotel kindly arranged a pick up from the Airport, got in at approx 0130 am. The hotel is located in a very busy market place and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting a gentle introduction to Delhi following a long plane journey. Hotel was clean, but the location spoilt the experience. It's the only place where I had to get out of my Tuk Tuk and walk back to the hotel due to gridlocked traffic. Anyone who doesn't like barking dogs or call to prayer early morning should avoid.Staff were indifferent, the only place where no-one wanted to discuss the India-Pakistan cricket game underway.Best avoided unless you can't get anywhere else or are particularly interested in import export from the surrounding commerce..."
63,1671,"Dec 17 2007 	Good enough	It took me a long time to decide upon Hotel Sri Nanak Continental as my destination upon arrival in New Delhi. As some other reviewers have noted, there seems to be a dearth of true mid-range lodging in Delhi. In many cases it is necessary to spend a small fortune to get what might be considered a moderate hotel in other places. I made my reservation at the Sri Nanak Continental and upgraded (paid, not complimentary) to a suite. My first experience was with the airport pickup. I walked through the arrivals area and saw many drivers with signs, but I didn't see my name on any of them. Since my flight had arrived about 20 minutes early (!) I decided to wait a few minutes before getting worried. I waited a little over an hour before calling the hotel. It turned out that the driver was waiting for me outside instead of inside the arrivals hall. It was fine that he was there, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that he would be outside and not inside. Once we met up, though, all went well getting to the hotel. Check-in went quite smoothly. I was able to grab a quick bite to eat in the restaurant. That was the only meal I had there - it was adequate....not great, not bad. The restaurant itself is a little on the dismal side....no windows and rather dark. My room was nice enough - it was certainly clean. It seemed to take a long time for the water to get hot. The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of stations on the flatscreen TV. I didn't see what a standard room looked like, but the suite had a small sitting area adjacent to the bed. It was like a standard room in a US chain such as a Comfort Inn - not a separate sitting room. The staff was courteous enough with the exception of a bellman who attempted to become a little too familiar with me (a solo woman) and then made some insulting remarks. The neighborhood is very congested and noisy, but the metro is at a convenient distance - maybe 10 minutes walking."
64,1671,"Dec 12 2007 	Overcharging Delhi Hotel	We have just returned from a 10 day stay in India. Unfortunately had to stay at the Sri nanak Continental in Delhi.Firstly the free Airport pick up came, late, with 1 car for 7 pasengers plus luggage. Had to wait almost an hour while they sorted out a Taxi.I had booked the most expensive 3 rooms they had. A large room was shown to us , which was not clean or tidy. they then showed us other rooms and we chose a much smaller room, which was just about bearable, Didnt realise that the bed was so hard as if there was no mattress, The pillows stank, the bedsheet was dirty, so had to have the sheets and pillow covers changed and the room cleaned. The dirty dusty windows of the room did not shut properly so spent 2 sleepless noisy nights.Do not ask them to get a Taxi as theirs is about 5 times as expensive, there is a taxi rank around the corner, about 3 minutes walk with cheap taxis.I saw 2 people check out, first one complaining about overcharging, second one about extra charges for Mini Bar. When I checked out they charged me for the large room although I stayed at the cheapest room, after complaing the manager cancelled a 4 food bill but not the 20 extra for the room. Then charged me for 3 nights, as a mistake, but refunded the 3rd night.The staff were helpful at all times, The restaurant is actually a cafe and the food was good. There is also free internet at all times and location is good for shopping.I would not stay again or recommend this hotel"
65,1671,"Dec 10 2007 	Clean Enough Erratic Service Noisy Neighborhood	We searched a great deal online to find this hotel in Delhi. Dismayed by the high prices and very negative reviews of many low-middle range hotels, we were attracted by this hotel's excellent web site, fairly reasonable prices, and offers of amenities. We also liked that they offered a courtesy pick-up from the airport, especially given the location of the airport. Unfortunately, although we had sent emails and called the hotel to book a reservation (pre-paying online, as they require) clearly requesting airport pick-up and listing flight number and exact times, no one was waiting to pick us up when we arrived at the Delhi airport. We called only to find out that they had forgotten to send someone (even though we were reportedly on the pick-up schedule). They didn't admit this at first, though- saying that the driver was &quot;on the way&quot; and &quot;stuck in traffic,&quot; and would be there in twenty minutes or so. They suggested we wait by the cafe stall outside the airport, and we were only to happy to do so. We had a coffee and tasty snack... Twenty minutes passed... thirty minutes passed... My husband kept calling to see what had happened to the driver, only to be told repeatedly how close they were. We didnt want to make a nuisance of ourselves but were concerned that we might be in the wrong place or the driver might have overlooked us somehow, especially when we were initially told it would be much less time. We waited an hour and had just about given up when finally our &quot;person&quot; arrived with a name placard. He apologized profusely and was very polite, cheerful, and communicative, which we appreciated. After a long drive (due to the heavy Delhi traffic), we finally arrived at the rather sketchy area where the Hotel Sri Nanak is located- and were greeted with apologies. In this situation I think a concrete gesture such as a complimentary fruit plate or room upgrade (if they wanted to be extravagant) to make amends would have been a nice gesture, but no conciliatory gestures were made. Hotel elevator is claustrophobic with screen gate- I preferred the stairs. Nice attention paid to decorating the hallway with a pleasant statue (possibly Ganesh) and flowers. Our room (306- I think) was adequately clean, and although the furnishings and dcor was a bit dated, it was fairly represented on the web site. The headstand of the bed looks more dreary in person than it does in photos. There was a nice flat screen tv with the usual lineup of Indian channels, news, and two movie channels. We were on the third floor overlooking a dismal alley and there was a fair amount of noise that came in the air vents. Traffic noise was heavy, and the alley also was busy with the activity of people centered on a street bonfire as well as packs of wild dogs that woke us up howling in the middle of the night. Ear plugs are a must. Not the hotels fault, but something to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper. The bathroom is quite cramped, and the water takes a while to heat up, but it does heat up eventually. Another thing I found strange was although there was toilet paper, the toilet paper bin was kept in the main bedroom- making it almost impossible to do anything but flush your paper. The soap provided by the hotel was quite harsh. The bedding was clean, and the floor was clean enough for bare feet, which was nice. By the time we got to our room we only had 30 minutes before the room service menu closed, so we made a quick order of veg. indian dishes. The food was ok, if not spectacular. We never had the opportunity to try the breakfast as our flights left too early in the morning. (Unfortunate, because a small snack and coffee would have really helped us get through our travels). The next morning as we were checking out, we told the management wed had specific items from the room bar (water, chips). They tried to charge us for a coffee we hadnt had (the bar was stocked with 1, not 2 coffees when we checked in, but we didnt know it was normally stocked with 2 coffee until our visit a night later), and finally backed down when we insisted we had not had it- an inconsequential matter, but made us feel rather unpleasant. We stayed at the same hotel after our trip to Agra and this time were put in a more dreary room without a mini bar- we didnt especially care about the mini bar issue, but the room smelled like garbage (rm. 204) so we requested to be transferred to our previous room and were accommodated. As we got settled in, we were interrupted by the staff several times- returning passports, presenting us with a wet bar inventory which we confirmed and initialed (a good idea but felt somewhat insulting- as if they still thought wed stolen a can of coffee!), among other things. We visited the upstairs restaurant and found it to be a dark, windowless room, decently decorated, with what seemed to be a computer with internet access (being used by two other guests). We might have stayed and eaten there, but the restaurant host was so cool to us that we didnt feel comfortable and went back to our room to order the same food via. room service. We had also been unclear that while airport pickup service is complimentary (in theory, if you dont mind waiting for them), airport return service is not, and in fact costs an additional 500 rs. to the domestic terminal and a whopping 750 rs. to the international airport. Our early morning driver to the airport did not speak to us- not a huge deal but again, not something that left us with warm feelings about our overall experience. Also note, you will be expected to pay the tax for your bill and cab fare to the hotel lobby in cash, which meant we ended up at the Delhi airport with 35 rs. to our name. (The one ATM at domestic was out of order, and no food stations in the airport accept credit cards so we went without breakfast). I think that the hotel situation in Delhi is generally quite dismal unless you can afford to pay for a very high end hotel (there seems to be a huge jump between low, middle, to very very high end with prices to match) and this room wasnt bad- but maybe because we were checking in fairly late at night and checking out early in the morning- our experience with staff and the hotel left us feeling rather down. A few staff members were unusually cheerful- notably the guy who accompanied the driver to pick us up, and someone in charge of finances who solved a charging problem before we even asked him to- but otherwise, our experience was tiring and we did not feel terribly welcomed. A decent deal if you are looking for a true mid-range hotel and dont care about being picked up from the airport in time. It is also possible that our experience was unusual, so you might check other reviews to see if they were met at the airport in a timely fashion. I am sure you could do far worse in Delhi. Our issues were not with the building or facilities as much as issues with logistics/atmosphere and that is easily overlooked, especially if youre not overtired from travel. You might consider if you are spending one day in Agra, to stay somewhere relatively inexpensive in Delhi a night, then go to a quite nice hotel in Agra, and then stay one more night in Delhi at your bargain hotel- the nicer hotel we stayed in at Agra (Hilton) was money very well spent. Note: the only guests I saw happened to be other foreign guests, which may influence the atmosphere/mood of the place."
66,1671,"Nov 30 2007 	basic accomodation good service	The hotel is decent, if you've been to Delhi you know how hard can it be to find a decent midrange hotel. The location is very chaotic and there is a is a large Sikh temple that starts chanting at about 5 am and this can wake you up (but I found it quite entertaining) so I recommend staying in Connaught Place area if you can afford it.The rooms are clean but old although some are updated, the breakfast is average compared with other hotels in India. On the positive side, this hotel offers like any other, the service of a driver, we decided to hire a driver to take us to Jaipur to avoid the crowed trains and it was the best idea. They gave us an excellent driver, very friendly and experienced in a great SUV. After we arrived to Jaipur we negotiated with the hotel and decided to keep him for the rest of our stay in India. It was fantastic, for that part along, I recommend this hotel."
67,1671,"Nov 26 2007	Basic accomodation in frenetic Karol Bagh area	With all of the poorly reviewed properties in Delhi (even the very expensive ones!), we chose Hotel Sri Nanak based on the photos on their website and the fact that they offer suites (with 4 beds) suitable for our 6 person family. In terms of the room itself (we stayed in their $120/night Presidential Suite) was spacious and of a basic 3-star level. Despite the name, it was certainly nothing fancy, furnishings were not particularly new nor did the room seem that clean. The staff was friendly and eager to help out. I'd call this hotel simply &quot;basic accomodations&quot; and not a great value all-together (even for the $65 standard rooms).The big negative for most people will be the location. Karol Bagh is India in all of its noisy, smelly, crowded, and frenetic glory. If you want to stay in the midst of a busy market area, then perhaps this is a positive, but it was nerve-wracking for us to take our kids anywhere on the street (to catch a cab etc). Also, note that there is a large Sikh temple 1 block away that starts chanting at about 5 am and this can wake you up. For most travelers (especially for your first time to India), pay the extra $ to stay in Connaught Place."
68,1671,Nov 24 2007 	Clean and Comfortable with Nice staff and Organized great trips	BOTTOM LINE: A nice clean and comfortable hotel that had nice staff and a great reservations department who arranged a good and affordable trip for usPROS: Nice amenities; conscientious staff (eg. allowed us to use a room free of charge to change in before we left for airport); reservations department arranged excellent and affordable private vehicle for Golden Triangle trip; free WiFi and internet access w/ computerCONS: A little out of the way (in Karol Bagh) - worth keeping the hotel's card for directions for autorickshaw drivers; average restaurantEXCEPTIONAL ITEMS: We booked a trip through the hotel which was affordable and enjoyable. They booked 2 nights in Agra and Jaipur and provided a driver who was very courteous and provided local guides (as needed) in each stop.
69,1671,"Nov 1 2007 	Excellent IF you know how bad can other places be	After reading all the bad reviews here, I've decided NOT to stay in this hotel. Interestingly enough, while it was a mistake, it was worth while. Instead, I've stayed at a terrible place called Hotel Classic in Channa Market for 2 nights, before getting a room at Sri Nanak. (For those interested in the Classic story, look it up - my review is there).Had I come to Sri Nanak in the first place, I would probably have had some bad things to say about it, same as the other reviewers. However, sometimes things can be seen only in comparison. You have to experience India, before rushing to conclusions. It's DIFFERENT (India that is).The front desk staff were great. The hotel owner himself, Mr. Nanak was there - an extremely likeable and chatty fellow.The rooms are well decorated, with a flat screen plasma on the wall. You get slippers to wear while in the room. Guess what, that's a nice touch. I've spent 2 days hopping around a different hotel on towels, because I did not want to step on the disgusting floor over there. Here, the floors are clean. The slippers are a nice added touch. The bed is comfortable, albeit too short (I'm 6'2&quot; / 186cm). I've mentioned this to Mr. Nanak the following day - he said that he already had similar complaints, and was thinking about replacing the beds.Yes, there are some bugs in the bathroom. They come through the ventilation grating, where the exhaust fan is. I've mentioned this to Mr. Nanak as well, saying he should put a steel mesh grating over it, on the outside. He liked the idea. My colleague, who I've stayed in the hotel with, thinks that if we were to return there within a year, we'd see the grating in place.The upstairs restaurant is excellent, with it's own chef. A fairly large selection of Indian cuisine. Now, I don't really like Indian food, however I've enjoyed a few interesting dishes. The breakfast is sub par, but it's so cheap, I see no reason to complain.On the second night, we had dinner with Mr. Nanak, who was very entertaining, and offered some refreshing views on business and the future of India, as well as his efforts to improve the hotel.Anyhow, I'm sure a few of you will think this review is shill - I don't really care. Read my other review (about Hotel Classic) and maybe you will understand.As we were checking out, 2 British fellows just arrived. They've asked me how is the hotel. I said - is this your first time in India? They said yes. I said, in this case, I don't think you're going to like it. Everything can be known only through comparison."
70,1671,"Oct 29 2007	Liked it so much we went back	This is a friendly, clean, modern well run place. Off the beaten track in a relatively quiet corner (this is India!) of Karol Bagh, it's within walking distance of the metro and the Ajmil Kahn Road bazzar. The rooms aren't huge but they are clean and well equiped (A/C, fan, TV, fridge, hot water etc). Free Wi-fi thoughout the hotel would have been useful if we had a laptop! But there is free internet in the restaurant. The food was fine, if a little over priced compared to other places we stayed in India. You can certainly stay in cheaper places (R/- 2126 incl. taxes), but the overall experience had us revisit the two subsequent times we were passing through Delhi. The pick-up from the airport or railway station is recommended, as even if you make it to Karol Bagh, few rickshaw drivers will know where it is. Just remember to take the phone number for the hotel in case the driver is running late (we'd left it behind when we first arrived in Delhi and ended up having to stay somewhere else as there was no internet at the international airport!). That said they were great the two other times we were picked up."
71,1671,"Oct 24 2007	Excellent service impeccable rooms great prices	I am a Yoga teacher leading tours of India and frequently bring people who are coming to India for their first time to this hotel. We are always so happy to stay at Sri Nanak because the staff are so responsible, always pick-up from the airport and train stations on time, and are very helpful and respectful. The restaurant is healthy and has great food! There is an excellent balcony on the roof with plants to enjoy views of the eagles circling around Delhi. The rooms are excellent, modern appliances and beautiful decor. This hotel has gone out of its' way to provide all comforts and thoughfulness towards its' guests."
72,1671,"Aug 13 2007 	Lovely Stay	After reading the positive reviews about it we finally decided to go for this hotel . Sri Nanak turned out to be a amazing hotel .Its a very nicely designed hotel We got more than we expected . The staff was polite , helpful . Its is a highly maintained hotel which is worth the price you pay for .The best part was the free Wi-Fi service they provide . The modern TFT T.V. were also good .Besides that the food served at the roof top restaurant was very delicious and of high quality . I would recommend travelers not to go in for cheap options available around as you wont feel safe in other hotels . I felt totally safe staying in hotel nanak . We also went to agra by the hotel cab and our journey was perfect . They organized a perfect travel package for us . Altogether i had a perfect stay in delhi.  My next holiday i will surely stay with hotel nanak only."
73,1671,Jul 31 2007 	Put us in a room without a window!	We booked the most expensive room at the Sri Nanak and it had no windows and creaky air conditioning. We got another room which was reasonably clean but had a slightly derelict toilet. On checkout they tried to charge for the expensive room.
74,1671,"May 9 2007	amazing stay	it is no less than any of the U.K. hotels,and that to at very comparitive prices.have wireless facilties for free.in U.K. u have to pay for them.food is awesome.with nice transport facilties and free breakfast."
75,1671,"Apr 14 2007 	HIghly rate Hotel Sri Nanak	This was my first visit to India and I was coming there to first attend a professional conference for my University and then, after that to do some sightseeing. So, for the first part of my visit, I was staying in a 5 star hotel in Delhi, but I wanted to move to less expensive, safe, clean hotel for the sightseeing portion of my visit. My goal in doing this was to see and experience more of the &quot;real India&quot;.I used this web site to locate the Sri Nanak hotel. Everyone spoke glowingly about how the staff was so friendly -- and although many compained about the neighborhood, a few others said in essence &quot;what are you complaining about... it's just India.&quot; Well, that as my guidance, I booked a room. I am delighted to report that, for me, it was the perfect decision. I have traveled quite a bit internationally and my main goal was to find a place that was safe and clean -- yet would give me access to roam around the less touristed parts of Delhi and get a taste of everyday life. That's exactly what I found. Yes, the streets are noisy ... for me, that's part of the charm and interest. The people were incredibly friendly in the neighborhood. I needed to have my glasses fixed from an accident a couple of days earlier. The desk staff in the hotel gave me directions and sure enough, the opticians at Pujabi Optical not only fixed my glasses, but had me stay for tea -- and then wouldn't even accept any payment for their services. I was able to visit some intersting shops and a small streetside Hindu shrine -- and, in each location, I experienced great hospitality. The hotel itself is clean, and the rooms certainly provide all the amenities I needed. Yes, the beds are on the hard side, but I like them that way, so for me that was not a problem. The free wireless in the rooms was much appreciated, and the tv, phone, and plumbing all worked fine. One more thing about the complimentary airport service. I had arranged to stay at the Sri Nanak for one day, then travel via airline to another part of India for a few days and then return to Delhi for another day before returning to the US. So, I had arranged for the Sri Nanak to have someone pick me up at the airport. Through a mistake in their scheduling procedure, the cab driver was told that I would arrive at 5:00 pm (when that was actually the time that I was leaving another city in India). When I arrived at 9 pm that night, the driver was still at the airport waiting for me. I was blown away by that level of conscientiousness. Needless to say, I was happy to give the driver a large tip.My goals and desires may not match those of other travelers, but for me the hotel Sri Nanak was the perfect location. If I am ever back in Delhi (which I hope to be), I definitely plan to make the Sri Nanak my home base."
76,1671,Apr 11 2007	Dirty loud hotel - completely overrated	This hotel left everything to be desired. The noise inside and out made it impossible to sleep - as did the hair from the previous guest left on the sheets. The staff was unfriendly and not helpful. I would strongly advise against staying in this hotel.
77,1671,Apr 6 2007 	moved after 1 night	very isolated - long walk to train station. taxi/rickshaws tell you they know where it is but don't. filthy street even by delhis standards. grim breakfast. redeeming feature - flashy showers - if they worked properly!
78,1671,"Apr 1 2007 	Overpromised and greatly underdelivered	Overpromised and greatly underdelivered My husband and I have stayed at many hotels worldwide and this is most definitely the WORST hotel that we have come across, despite the fact that we only stayed for 3 nights. We had read several positive reviews before booking our stay at Sri Nanak but on arrival we were thoroughly disappointed. My husband and I arrived at 10pm from Bangalore. On arrival we were greeted by a young man at reception with &quot;Oh...so you are Mr Quayum?&quot;. I may have an Indian surname with an English accent but this hardly conveys confidence for a hotel meant for international tourists. Our stay as listed: 1. The bed covers were dirty, complimentary with long black hairs and small dead flies in the folds. We had to request for 'clean' sheets. 2. The air conditioning (a large machine) was noisy and positioned directly by the bed at arm's length. 3. The hotel's website states 'running hot and cold water' - hot water was only available on running the hot tap for over 20 minutes, when we informed reception that there was no hot water, we were told to keep running it until it became hot! 4. The bathroom fan exploded (yes...sparks and smoke and then black out!) I called reception, somebody came up and told me that they would have an electrician see to it the next day - this did not happen...surprisingly. 5. At 4am we were woken up by someone banging on our door (the doors were flimsy and the staff kept trying to open the door from the outside at other times)! There were no door signs to state 'Do not disturb' or 'Please clean my room'. 6. These rooms are not sound proofed - we could hear guests chatting loudly and their children running up and down the corridor outside our room at 6am. 7. The wardrobe door was broken, dirty and had a strong odour so we decided against keeping anything in there. 8. There was a safe in the wardrobe however it was not bolted down or attached to anything - so anyone could walk off with it! All in all a miserable stay that we had to make do with as there was no time to search for other hotels during our 3 night stay in Delhi. Think very carefully before staying here...you have been warned!"
79,1671,"Mar 31 2007 	barely expensive	It is not a bad hotel if you compare it to other Karol Bagh hotels, but unfortunatelly it costs 10 times what another similar kind of hotel will cost you in new Delhi."
80,1671,"Mar 26 2007 	Great Hotel	Was very apprehensive about booking a hotel in Karol Bagh as I was travelling with a girly party (my 23 month daughter, mum, mother in law and sister.) However this hotel was fab - we booked the presidential suite which was ideal for a family as we had two separate rooms within one room and allowed privacy and peace for my daughter to sleep.The hotel location is fantastic with the Gurudwara, McDonalds and Pizza Hut, ATM and the great shops all in walking distance.The hotel restaurant is OK, food is nice and room service is handy too but you can order takeaway to your room which is an added bonus.The water is a bit temperamental but you only have to leave it running for 5mins and its hot - not a problem.The hotel is very clean and well kept.Staff are good and manager very nice.If staying in Karol Bagh - go here"
81,1671,"Mar 21 2007 	Sri Nanak -great if you can get a cab to find it !!	Having read various reviews of Sri Nanak, we-a party of 4-booked directly for 5 nights, and requested the presidential suite.We were generally pleased with the room-more likely to impress a president from a small nation than &quot; ol' W&quot; of the US Survey- but there were various things that could have been cleaner-the bath took for ever to run away, but as a mid range hotel it served its purpose well. The room was large and has a fridge and table and chairs as well as a sofa and a chaise long......A real bonus is the roof top restaurant-serving breakfast lunch and evening meals. It's good value and the food is generally very tasty. Nice to sit in at night and sup a beer or two-providing they don't run out !One other point to bear in mind is that Sri Nanak is a way out from the centre of Delhi-Karol Bagh is a area of town that not a lot of cab drivers from Connaught Place seem to know very well- one night whilst coming back the driver got lost and was asking a local for the hotel -showing him a card with the address on: The man disclaimed any knowledge of the hotel or road: At that point we realised that we were actually no more than a hundred yards from it and actually in the right street !!All in all a good bet if your not too fussy."
82,1671,Mar 17 2007	Expensive for what you get	I booked this hotel based on online reviews. I knew that it was basic and several reviews indicated good service. On arrival it was clear that the rooms were very basic but clean. Staff were pleasant. Internet use was good and free. Rooftop restaurant was extremely average. The location was on a very nosiy busy street in a very run down area of Delhi. Most guests are locals. My airport pickup was OK and free but airport drop off has to be paid for. The cost for a basic room was US$40 and a suite (a glorified basic room) was US$81. The term &quot;suite&quot; should be interpreted with caution. All in all basic accomodation with no frills should really be cheaper.
83,1671,"Mar 11 2007 	Nice by India standard	Nice enough place. Nothing great on the outside, but rooms were more western then most. I would reccomend it over many other hotels."
84,1671,"Mar 1 2007 	Think twice before staying here	We decided to stay at the Sri Nanak last month after reading all the positive reviews, however we were quite disappointed.The rooms themselves were ok, reasonably clean, however the bathroom was well below standard and the door was rotten. No hot water in the afternoons either.The front desk appeared helpful, but on a number of occasions tried to over charge us for taxis, cars etc. They also misled us regarding the excursions to places like Agra.I can see how some visitors have found the staff to be overly helpful, but a more seasoned traveller will be more savvy and realise when they're trying to take you for a ride!The most negative thing was that when we left the hotel and arrived in Mumbai we realised that some clothing had been stolen from our suitcase. So if you stay at the Sri Nanak make sure you always leave your suitcases locked even if there's nothing valuable inside!We travelled around India for some time and the Sri Nanak is far below the 3* stars it claims in comparison to the other hotels we stayed at.Finally, if you do choose to stay here (which I wouldn't do again), then book directly with the hotel as the rate is MUCH lower than offered by third-party booking websites."
85,1671,"Feb 23 2007 	Give it a miss	We planned to stay at this hotel for three nights, however checked out after the first night. The hotel was very noisy, the bed sheets reeked of some petroleum products, the phone did not work, the shower did not have a curtain and the flow projected straight over the toilet and the roof top breakfast area had filthy tablecloths. When we said we were not staying, they advised us that we had to pay for 3 nights as we had not given 24 hours notice of cancellation of our other 2 nights. We replied that this was not possible as we did not know that the hotel would be so bad. We were extremely lucky in that as we were discussing this a colleague of my husbands happended to walk into reception, a total coincidence as we did not even know they were in Delhi, and they had just checked out for the same reasons, which gave credibility to our complaints. We left paying for the night we stayed. I do not recommend this hotel."
86,1671,"Feb 21 2007 	Avoid This Hotel . Its over-rated	Having read the good reviews on tripadvisor and some other websites i decided to book this hotel. I was dissapointed when i got there. First of all they gave us a room that was not in good condition at all and faced the main road which was noisy. When i complained they then gave us an alternative. If i had not complained they would have left us there . The rooms are not in good condition, the duvets and blankets are not clean. The hotel had promised us a welcoming fruit basket which we did not receive. The location of the hotel is not good. The roads are dirty , busy , noisy and polluted. Having travelled around in delhi, there are other nicer and claner places to stay. On one day our room was not cleaned, we were told that as we had taken the key they did not clean it even though all hotels have master keys. The dining area is located on the rooftop which was nice in the mornings. When we booked taxis from the hotel, we later discovered that the hotel was charging a commision for the service. Also , the hotel gave us a poor exchange rate commision when we exchanged currencies. Ignore the good reviews you see for this hotel, as non of them are true. I am suspicious as to the source of these. Avoid at any cost. You are better paying a bit more and getting something alot better. I will not be staying here again and nor will i recommend this to anyone."
87,1671,"Feb 16 2007	Not for everyone	The hotel did send a driver to pick us up from Delhi airport which was a god send and all the staff were very polite and helpful. I am surprised that no-one seems to have mentioned how hard the beds were though. I asked for extra blankets to put under me as it was like sleeping on a rock! I think it might be a suitable hotel for backpackers or seasoned travellers but not for first time visitors to India as Delhi is a bit of a shock in itself. The hotel is not in a great area and we were woken up the first morning at 5am by a parade going by that we actually thought was a riot! and the second morning at 4.30 by someone with REALLY LOUD speakers in the middle of the road. Very bizarre. The hotel is also quite noisy - but so is India! Overall we had a great holiday but even though the staff and restaurant were very good I would recommend spending a bit more and staying in a good hotel in Delhi in a central area. Of all the areas we toured, Delhi is the probably the biggest shock, and a good hotel is a must."
88,1671,"Feb 12 2007	A good hotel when travelling with children ..esp the presidential suite	We stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and overall I would say it was good place to stay.We were picked up from the airport which we were grateful for. We were travelling with children and stayed in the Maharaja suite which was quite good. We had a problem with the TV , they fixed it promptly. The staff were polite and happy and the manager Sandeep was friendly and takes a lot pf pride in his hotel.The taxi to the station in the early morning was a nightmare and so was the pick up the following week-end. I don't rate their taxi service. There was a mix up with our rooms the following week-end , we had pre booked and confirmed for the following week-end but we were offered an &quot;alternative &quot; maharaja suite which did not have the bunk beds for the kids. After a bit of protest and disatisfaction we were offered the presidential suite (at the same price) - which is very good. It can sleep up to 6. I would say not all the staff are conscientious as the manager.We had breakfast in our room and also ate once upstairs in the roof top hotel. The food is reasonable and I would eat again.The back of the hotel is not noisy.Karol Bagh is not one of the best area but there is a metro station nearby and a gurud wara , from where we heard lovely melodic hyms once.The rooms are what you see on their web sites. I would suggest you look at the room first before accepting it."
89,1671,"Feb 11 2007	fantastic management	average 3 start hotel situated in a busy commerical area. not your above average hotel (this will cost you an arm and leg in Delhi) but staff and management go out of their way to make your stay stress free and relaxing as possible!my daughter got sick one nite and i foned reception at 2 am...they got a taxi for me and manager himself came with us to hospital...a fantastic gesture i thought!!!!internet, massage chair, newspapers, airport pick up and drop off, one whole day sighseeeing tour, half day shopping tour and fruit bowel were all given free of charge together with 5 key ring holders!For the price definitely woth the value!"
90,1671,"Jan 28 2007 	Think carefully before going here	This hotel was not what I expected from the reviews. Our family of four had two rooms booked for the nights of 8, 9, 10 January. We were met at the airport and transported by two cars (we had been promised one large car). Karol Bagh is not the best area to stay in but the hotel staff were courteous. However, the rooms did not live up to expectation. Our girls room had the most terrible smell in the room and on all the bed linen, and they had to lay some of their clothes on the pillow so as not to breathe in the fumes. We did ask for a change, but the alternative was no better. Our room had no fridge, the jug didn't work and the shower water just fell all over the floor of the bathroom. No beds had been swept under for some time! Decided there and then to telephone somewhere else, except the phone didn't work, not then nor in the morning. Neither did it in the girls' room nor the room of some friends we ran into unexpectedly in reception the following morning who were also checking out because of the smell in their room. They had also read the trip advisor reviews and were pretty disillusioned.. My husband also didn't sleep because of the noise. We moved to the Jukaso Inn downtown near Connaught Place which was around the same price and much more satisfactory."
91,1671,"Jan 21 2007 	Very good hotel	We thought this was a lovely small well run hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. The staff were fantastic and incredibly helpful. We chose the presidential suite which is ideal for a family as it can easily sleep up to 5 - 6 people with 2 bathrooms. The hotel had some nice touches including free internet access, a daily paper pushed under the door and a fresh bowl of fruit served every day. The restaurant offered a good range of dishes, it got a bit chilly in the evening in January (it's on the roof) so we opted to have meals served in our room. The Karol Bagh area is busy in the day with plenty of shops but it does get quiet enough in the evening and we had no problems sleeping. We tended to use the taxi service from the hotel which was great and reasonably priced - the drivers really took care of us and cut out the hassle. It took about 15 minutes to get to Connaught Circus. All in all a great stay."
92,1671,"Jan 18 2007	ok	I stayed in this hotel in January. It was clean, inexpensive and the staff were generally helpful. The wireless internet was very useful and there were no problems with the hot water once we got used to the taps. However, this hotel is definitely not a luxury option and the location in Karol Bagh is not great. I agree with the comment that this hotel is a bit like a cheap 1970s US motel, or one of the two-star hotels you find in the Pigalle area of Paris. If I stayed in Delhi again, I would probably stay in a five star hotel, as there is a dearth of high quality mid-range options in that city."
93,1671,"Jan 17 2007 	Average	The hotel was average, nothing special at all. The area is not the best at night. Our particular room had no windows and the mattress was very thin! The staff at the front desk did really care about anything and were always on the phone. I would try and find something closer. Dont trust the photo's."
94,1671,"Jan 1 2007 	All over nice	The executive room was clean and quite modern, with a nice bathroom with shower. All in all a nice tourist class hotel giving you great value for your money.The hotel is placed quite sentral in New Dehli, a short ride from the railwaystation. Try to avoid eating in the resturant, as it was nothing special. It looked old, dirty and beeing at the top floor of the hotel you would expect a view,well there is not.The sourrundings of the hotel is not much at night, with the only lights coming from ATMs and jevellers shops. If you need a place just for the night i would recomend Sri Nanak continental. The staff was friendly and serviceminded during the two days stay 20-22 of desember."
95,1671,"Dec 21 2006	Clean book direct	Clean in general. The hot water seemed to be by request and then you needed to wait 30 minutes. This seemed to be the case in some places across India in mid-range hotels, but we thought they could do a bit more. The breakfast is very basic and not very tasty. We didn't like the area either as you aren't near to anything really. We had to request cleaner towels and toilet paper. It seems hard to find a decent hotel in Delhi. This wasn't bad, but book directly as we booked through expedia and paid over the odds. Staff were friendly enough."
96,1671,"Dec 18 2006 	Surprisingly good	Obviously, the Sri Nanak is not the Hyatt or the Sheraton. However, once you get over your initial doubts, for instance, about the area the hotel is located in, then it's not a bad hotel at all. In fact, as it turns out, Karol Bagh, the area where the hotel is located offers some of the busiest and most authentic street markets of Delhi. It is a GREAT place for doing shopping, dining, etc. once you get used to the huge amounts of people on the street, the cars, the noise, etc. The hotel itself is simple, but clean, and the staff is quite friendly. They also have on the roof of the hotel a restaurant, which offers a rather unattractive breakfast for westeners, but quite delicious Indian cuisine. Also, Karol Bagh is a very lively area, so there is a fair amount of noise during the day, but at night it quietens down. Then the only thing noticable is the barking of the street dogs...I would definitely go there again, although I can see that the Sri Nanak is not for everyone. A big plus should also be mentioned: they offer free WiFi in all rooms! Very, very handy when you are in India."
97,1671,"Dec 18 2006 	not bad	for a first time visitor to delhi we found the surrounding location pretty scary.it looked even more run down and destitute than i imagined, its right on the edge of the biggest market in asia and the hussle and bustle was a bit intimidating on the first day.after a day or so we got into it and thought it was pretty cool.if your looking for budget prices then stay away i think we paid over the odds compared with other places we stayed.the hotel itself was clean and tidy, the staff helpful and the food was ok. would i stay again - yes i think i would."
98,1671,"Dec 8 2006 	Clean safe and excellent value for money	Being a lone female arriving in Delhi at 4am I was very pleased to take advantage of the free hotel transfer. I think I might have been a little stressed otherwise given the things you see at the airport.The staff were excellant and went out of their way to help. The hotel was very clean. The bathroom was fine and certainly better than a lot of places in Delhi at this price, that's for sure. There was a complimentary bottle of water and basket of fruit in my room. The beds were reasonably comfortable but not sprung. I found it a little noisy at times. For instance there was a family on my floor who insisted on having a conversation at 2am in the corridor, and they weren't exactly using hushed tones. One thing I would suggest is that they introduce &quot;Do not disturb&quot; signs that can be posted outside the door so the staff don't keep disturbing you when all you want to do is sleep off your travelling and jet lag.I didn't actually venture out of the hotel as the area doesn't look that enticing but I didn't think is was unsafe either."
99,1671,"Dec 8 2006 	Not for the faint of heart. Adventurers ony.	If you are looking at this hotel and are used to the good stuff (Sofitels, Hiltons, etc.) you SHOULD STOP NOW. The whole Delhi experience is a jarring one for westerners, and frankly, while going to a hotel like this is safe, it will make the experience that much more trying. If you are looking at it because no other rooms are available in the entire city (which is what happened to me) go ahead and cancel your trip to Delhi, or head on over to Mumbai, which is a city that actually has a good airport, roads, and enough good hotels to hold everyone.I should note though that the staff was VERY friendly."
100,1671,"Dec 6 2006	Unbeatable value for the budget; friendly 	I am an American, and I've stayed at this hotel twice in the past 30 days, each time for a few nights. Think 1970's Best Western or Days Inn goes masala, and you'll get a sense of decor and premesis condition. I came back to the hotel because the staff really is friendly and gives 5 star worth of helpful service. I did not eat there, so I can't comment on that. Yes the neighborhood is noisy from 7:30 am 'til 9:30pm. But I slept like a rock. Yes the mattress was thin, but that's the style here. Like I said, I slept like a rock. I read the review by someone who was not expecting an Indian-style bathroom (he's in India - what did he expect?). There's a toilet, toilet paper, shower head, but no tub. It was no problem for me; just don't put your toiletries-bag on the floor while you shower. The place is cleanish: some of the hardware is old, but nothing is dusty or moldy, just worn. That goes for the sheets and towels too, but I had no problem with using them. If you have your laundry done, be sure to specifically identify what you don't want ironed! The default is to iron it, what ever the material. A couple of polyester shirts came out shiny from too hot an iron. The second time, I'd learned my lesson, pointed out what not to iron, and there were no problems. When I come back to Delhi, I will defintely stay here because the folks are friendly and the value is unbeatable! One piece of advice, consider either retaining whatever driver you pick up from in front of the hotel or learn how to walk to the hotel from the gurdwara, because taxi drivers can't find this place. I suspect many taxi-walas can't read, so the map on the back of the hotel's business card is useless to drivers, who will drive two blocks, stop, ask for directions, advance two more blocks, repeat. The gurdwara, however, is easy to find."
101,1671,"Nov 27 2006 	I would stay there again!	We chose this hotel based on the positive reviews, which I pretty much agree with. The place is very clean, not luxury level, but for the price, it's a bargain. The restaurant and staff are outstanding, and the free internet is a bonus. The only down side is that the neighborhood is nothing special. It's not bad, or unsafe, just nothing to interest a tourist. Don't expect a four star resort, just expect a nice clean room and a hard working staff who aims to please. We didn't use the hotel's travel arrangements, but others who did seemed pleased. The hotel did provide free pickup at the airport, which was also a good feature."
102,1671,"Nov 26 2006 	Good hotel good value...	I got the &quot;presidential suite&quot; for about $100USD during late Nov 2006. Very large room, with 1.5 baths. Other rooms are probably half this cost. Great for our family of four, and it could easily sleep six with its one king, one full and two twin bunkbeds. It was clean, and service was very good. Ordered room service and food was good as well. Free internet. I would easily recommend staying here. Located near Connaught Place. About 40 mins to the airport in Delhi traffic, but it took us exactly 20 minutes at 4:30AM since there was no traffic that early."
103,1671,"Nov 23 2006 	Good overall hotel	The hotel is located in Karol Bagh which is a very busy and tight area in the centre of Delhi. Although quite noisy, it does quieten down during the night. Karol Bagh is good for shopping and it is easy to grab an Auto (3 wheeled taxi) to Connaught Place.As promised, I was provided with complimentary pickup from the airport which is 30-45 mins away from the hotel. The hotel looks quite small from the outside and reception is also small. The rooms however are fairly spacious and tastefully decorated, spread over 3 floors. The most important thing is that the rooms are all clean and air conditioned. Free internet access is also provided in the hotel's basement.The hotel staff, including its drivers, are all very polite and friendly. Sightseeing tours are available in comfortable air conditioned vehicles.I was delighted with the quality of the food at the hotel's rooftop restaurant. The menu contained an assortment of dishes at very resonable prices, all cooked traditionally. I highly recommend the &quot;Afghani Chicken&quot;!Overall I was happy with my 5 nights stay at the hotel. If you're looking for a good 3 star hotel at a reasonable rate, located in the centre of Delhi, then this hotel is definitely worth considering."

Well, the hotel is fabulous the rooms are pretty good the staffs are great, as v are very special for them they waited for us for the B/ fast till 11:15 am since they close the B/fast by 10: 30am the food here is fabulous, the staffs are very co-operative specially the front desk manager was Ms Leena was very help full and co-operative too.........the rooms are very neatly cleaned and the best part is they have location also just 100 m from Karol Bagh Metro, the most happening place of the town........ We had taken two rooms and we never felt tht we are at all far from our homes, since it was a small business trip bt next time it will be a family trip at the same destination and same hotel if the thing remain good in future. I wish the Hotel Sunrise all the best and best of luck in Near future also.KEEP IT UP"
3,1672,Coments for good service	Very good service at hotel Sunrise. Helpfull and kind staff. Hotel location is very good market is very near and metro station is also near. Very quite place after very long time I sleep nicely because of I in my country work very hard and got vocation for relax so all I got in Hotel Sunrise. I reccomand this hotel.
4,1672,"Nov 24 2009 	A very good hotel in center of Delhi	Me and my husband book this hotel through a website hotels.com for 5 days, pick-up was free from airport. Hotel people pick-up us with kind of grand welcome with flower garland. We were surprised, because we have read many bad comments about hotel, but we got a very good service they provide us good room and morning we order breakfast it was realy very tasty. I am in Italy now but the taste we cant forget. Till now we have that taste in our mouth. We reccommend this hotel to all the italian who go to India.Thanks and reagrds to Hotel Sunrise and staff specialy for kichen staff."
5,1672,"Nov 18 2009 	No Ventilation in My Room	It was a horrifying experience sleeping in a room with no ventilationand no natural light, very humid rooms are in this hotel. I could notbreathe properly. I wish that I could have stayed in a hotel with someventilation. I found much better hotel in my onward journey."
6,1672,Nov 15 2009	Good location	We stayed at this hotel for a few nights in Nov 09. The room was very small the airconditioner was much too noisy we had to turn it off. The staff were OK as long as you kept tipping them. They only clean room if asked to. Breakfast was terriable. There is no resturant but the do have room service agian the food was awful. .
7,1672,Nov 15 2009 	Foul Smell in the Room	Why do they have to use the detergent which give a foul smell in therooms. I change my room 5 times but the rooms were dark and smelly.But had to manage the night because it was 1`o clock at night and Ishifted to a nearly hotel which was much better.
8,1672,Nov 11 2009 	Never Never This Hotel	A bunch of touts who are only interested to make extra money. We werecharged heavily for going to Taj Mahal by taxi as they because afterour life at night when we came to the hotel. We could have done thesame thing from another travel agent at one third of the price.
9,1672,"Nov 9 2009 	FIRST CLASS HOTEL	I recentley stayed at the Hotel Sunrise. The hotel and rooms there are faultless. Very comfortable, unbelievably clean and beautifully furnished. The service there is exellant and you will not be dissapointed by the hospitality given by all the staff. The restaurant serve beautiful food and is very good value. This hotel is in a perfect location and is ideal for anyone visiting Delhi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
10,1672,"Nov 6 2009 	DONT GO HERE	I read the reviews, and I understand how somle people may have been fooled by the owners smile. But dont let the friendliness fool you, this hotel is a complete scam unless you already know India and are Indian yourself. The hotel owner lied to us several times when we asked him travel questions, including telling us that the only way to travel was by train or car, and that we would have to wait 8-10 days for a train ticket (a complete lie, when we finally found the REAL international tourist office at the New Delhi rail, we got a ticket for the next day at HALF the price he told us). Every time we asked the staff a simple travel question, such as where the regional trains left from; they refered us to the owner, who would proceed to lie. He offered us a car too; as a ridiculous price, and tried showing us pictures of happy customers. While he searched through, instead sketchy pictures of women posing for him in bedrooms came up which he quickly hid. Eventually he realized we werent game for his information. The moment we solidly said no to his travel car, was the moment the smiles stopped from him. Some of the staff of his is friendly, but this guy is a pure scam artist. DONT GIVE HIM BUSINESS. Please, for the sake of those who lost money; got ripped off; got stuck in broken down cars miles away, DONT GO HERE.O ya, and it does have WIFI, but it doesnt reach your room. Also the area is scam central, as number one business around isnt the market, its scamming travel agencies running the same bit he is. And on one last note, the interior of the hotel is a weak escape from delhi polluted air as the staff constantly cleans the floor with toxic smelling cleaning products that were long ago banned from the west."
11,1672,"Nov 5 2009 	Very clean friendly family type hotel in the REAL India	I stayed at Sunrise for 17 days last month - over the Diwali period and can recommend it. I am about to return there in December1- It is a newly and completely restored small hotel, new bathrooms, furniture and a nice new mattress etc and kept very clean.2- While some of the staff are not highly trained professionals this adds to the charm - it is like a family run hotel and any minor flaws are fixed up swiftly and cheerfully. 3- The front desk staff are some of the friendliest and nicest people i have met in India. Ms Leena is a gem with the biggest welcoming smile in Delhi.4- I grew to love Karol Bagh. It is a REAL Indian bazarr with great character and not much touristy stuff however It can be a little confronting at first but stick with it because all the shops you could ever need and great markets and stalls, hundreds of them are just a walk away. Yes there are several small quiet parks in Karol Bagh and an amazing wood carving studio and gallery just next door but one to the hotel.5- And the efficient and clean KAROL BAGH Metro Station is just a few minutes away. three stops to Connaught Place - called Rajiv Chowk Station. You dont want to be relying on driving everywhere in Delhi. No way! The crowds dont start till noon so get going early if you want to miss them in Karol Bagh's wonderful narrow streets..6- Sure the breakfast is basic..but it breaks your fast and its free, I usually added a great fresh cut fruit salad for a modest sum and was very happy. If you want a REALLY good coffee in Delhi avoid the trendy coffee palaces at Connaught Place and go to Religare - Arts_i Gallery Its on the corner Connaught Circus and Kasturba Ghandi Marg. 1st floor. best coffee and good food with great art.7- Sunrise is a new hotel so to find it ask to be taken to the Regal Continental Hotel. The entrance is in a clean lane and Sunrise is RIGHT NEXT DOOR set back from the lane so it can be hard to see. Alternatively when driving down Saraswati Marg the CLARK HOTEL sign is easy to spot - its a good hotel too! - The Regal and Sunrise are in the same unnamed lane on the other side of Saraswati Marg as the CLARK. Remember those tips and Sunrise is easy for you and your driver to find. Maybe I will see you there in December. An Oz traveller."
12,1672,"Nov 5 2009 	This hotel is scamming	I had booked two days and went there to cancel the first day of my booking and add two additional days. So I paid, but after that they said &quot;we don't have any empty rooms but we will do our best&quot;. What that was supposed to mean I had to find out later...The first day of my stay they recognized me on the street, asking me &quot;what are you doing here? we didn't expect you&quot;. Refering to our agreement and payment, they just said &quot;In business, trust doesn't matter. But of course we have a room for you today, but you'd need to pay for that&quot; (pay again, what the heck?!). In the middle of the dispute they asked for my receipt, saying &quot;we need that&quot;. Thinking they just needed it temporary to give me a refund or make a copy or something, I handed it to them. But they wouldn't return it to me! And that was it, still standing on the street, and for them, the story was over.To sum it all up: I paid them for THREE days, I stayed there ZERO days and left with NO receipts or bills to prove anything or file case against them!"
13,1672,"Nov 2 2009 	Good location good price and great stay	We have read some good and bad comments on Trip Advisor about Hotel Sunrise. We booked this hotel for 1 day to check there services and thought if they provide us good service then we can extend our stay. They pick-up us from airport early morning because our flight Finn Air was arrive at Delhi airport very early morning. We had check-in. They provide us very good room with window with Balcony. So we decide to stay other 4 days. Hotel front Manager Ms. Leena was very friendly and always smile and ask us Madam are you satisfied with our services. and we smile too and reply he Lenna we are very happy.

15,1672,"Oct 30 2009 	OK but ...	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in October 2009. The room was fine although we had to ask for a top sheet on the bed. The a/c worked ok but was somewhat noisy with a rapping sound. The breakfast was very good although the coffee seemed to be instant Nescafe. The neighborhood, however, is a drawback. The streets are terribly crowded, noisy, and dirty, and there are touts every step of the way. The best aspect of this hotel is the remarkably low price -- around $30 per night."
16,1672,"Oct 29 2009 	Best hotel in budget price	Hotel Sunrise is the best hotel in budget price. Hotel location is good for shopping. Me and my wife stayed in this hotel we feel very comfortable.

This is good for new traveler in Delhi. We will send our friends to this hotel.We will recommend this hotel to all the traveler's who come to Delhi first time.

17,1672,"Oct 26 2009 	worst hotel i have ever seen	heading: the reality of this hotel.during my stay in india, i booked this hotel.hotel owner did not seem to run a hotel business, he was rather intersted in booking my agra-jaipur trip. i was given a non ventilated shabby room and on complainin he promised to upgrade me only if i book trip with him.when i refused for the trip, a black tall man with red eyes took me to his travel agency on the corner of the road. i was so scared.that owner also started following me. upon reaching there, they pressurised and as i was a sole travelller in this alien place i had no option but to accept the tour and pay them.the next morning, a small little car in bad condition arrived.i reluctantly sat in it as i was told that no other option is available.as expected, the car broke halfway. JESUS!!! i immediately left that place and had to walk around 5 miles to get another taxi.i rushed back to delhi and checked out of this hotel.they didnot refund any of my money.I felt cheated and i felt as if they are not hoteliers, they are a bunch of touts.!!!"

They are take care of the matteress, bedsheet, curtains, wall colours, linen and the cleanliness of the whole hotel. I also took few pictures of Hotel by phone. They don't provide you just a service, but they give you an experience. all staff are very Friendly. The one place where you can be sure that your trip will always be a pleasure. You will get everything near by Hotel. so, come and enjoy your holidays."
19,1672,Oct 21 2009 	Dreadful Experince at Sunrise	Its a worst ever Hotel I have stayed with. Staff with no professionalism &amp; every time taxi drivers are sitting at reception in dirty clothes looking for there customers. I was badly scared to check-in into this Hotel but had no option in the mid night. whole night staff shuts &amp; screams. Rats &amp; lizards are just like room partners staying over there in all rooms When I was not comfortable with the atmosphere I requested to refund my money I paid for but they refused to return my money &amp; misbehaved with me &amp; said that I can leave from the Hotel. The owner himself doesn't know the meaning of courtesy.I do prefer t sleep on streets rather than staying Over sunrise where Sun can never rise
20,1672,"Oct 18 2009 	Hotel Sunrise and Its owner Mr. Singh were great.	I am a NRI (non-resident Indian) and live in the US. I was in Delhi with my (American) extended family members as a tourist. I stayed in Hotel Sunrise for 4 nights in late September 2009. We rented 3 rooms. Our rooms were spacious and clean. House keeping was excellent. Hotel mangement was very friendly and helpful and almost every one in the hotel staff spoke English. The hotel owner, Mr. Singh, arranged taxi (with a guide) for us to go to Taj Mahal and surroundings and also for sightseeing in Delhi. He also had the taxi take us to the airport at 4.30AM to catch an early flight. Mr. Singh did a fantastic job and all with a joke and a broad smile.Both the hotel rates and the taxi charges were extremely reasonable for Delhi. I would recommend this hotel without any reservation to anybody planning a trip to Delhi and I will be a repeat customer here next time I visit Delhi.Mr. Singh, Thank you and take care.Raj Natarajan, Texas, USA"

22,1672,"Oct 7 2009 	Ok Hotel. Don't do the tour	The hotel was ok for the price. However, the tour guide service associated with the hotel was pretty bad. The driver in Delhi was ok. But then when we traveled to Agra from Delhi, the driver was horrible. He yelled at us and made the trip horrible. When we got to Agra, we called the tour guide head office and asked to get another driver. The new driver couldn't make it until the next day, so we had to pay for a new tour in Agra. When we ask the head tour guy for money back he said that he would plan something special for us in Jaipur. Did anything happen? No. If I had to do it over again, I would have found a different tour group. Otherwise the hotel is ok for the price."
23,1672,"Oct 3 2009 	STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE FROM EUROPE OR THE WEST	Very disappointing hotel and people running the place. This is definitely not a 3 star hotel. We made reservations online. When we got there they didn't even have our reservations. The room they gave us didn't have any windows and the bathroom was below standard - much different from the description given online. After my wife and I settled in bed, we got a call in the middle of the night and the receptionist said that we had to change the room since the room was already reserved for someone else. This was very inconvenient. The last night we stayed there, we were woken up in the middle of the night by the people from the reception and their friends making a lot of noise and talking very loud down the hallway. On check out, we left with a bad feeling. We found out later that the receptionist charged us 5 times the normal taxi fare to the train station. In addition, we were ripped off when the director of the hotel purchased train tickets for us. He lied about the ticket price. Unfortunately, because of him we ended up paying almost 70% more for the tickets than they were worth. Stay away from this place. They run it like an indian mafia. Very disappointing and very unprofessional."
24,1672,"Sep 26 2009 	Great Stay at Hotel Sunrise	We found this hotel on the internet, it was new so we thought we would try it. The hotel was well worth the money, the rooms are well presented, extremely CLEAN and well fitted out with TV, bar fridge, AC and attached bathrooms. The staff were so friendly and accomodating, in our first room the internet signal was a little low so they actually moved us to a room with better signal straight away! We couldn't of asked for anymore, we will be staying here again when we return to Delhi! Thanks Hotel Sunrise!"

As per our booking, everything went as planned. we were picked up from the airport driven start to the hotel, on arrival it was the most unexpected welcoming, where we was offered drinks and we were garland then we were escorted to our suit. Our room was very beautiful we felt at home room service was excellent. The food was divine. View was good. The most exciting part of our trip was that the management helped us arrange or tour in and around Delhi, our car was booked itinerary was set and were ready for our tour. Oh my god it was a tour out of this world! at the end of it all we were driven back to the airport. To conclude I would recommend this hotel to each and every traveler I know, who is looking for an unforgettable holiday, adventurous tour &amp; a luxurious stayP.S...

So decided to catch up this hotel. But oh God it should not be termed as a hotel. It had RATS in the room. The bed sheets were torn. The Aircondition was not working and there was no water when I went to take a shower. The bathroom had so much of foul smell that I had to pack up my bag and just leave. When I wanted to leave they charged me extra money which was not agreed at the time of check in. They forced me to pay. It was a nightmare and I thought the musclemen will come and beat me up, if I dont pay I was horrified."
27,1672,"Sep 20 2009 	undisovered gem of a place in Delhi	As I write this, I am still a guest at this Hotel. We wanted to book this hotel from Bangalore itself but did not have suffecient info to do that. We booked at another popular hotel and arrived at Delhi. One night at the Popular &quot; south indian &quot; hotel , and we beat a hasty retreat. We had the address of Hotel Sunrise but NOT thier telephone number [--]. Hence the next day we made it a point to SEARCH for the hotel and finally found it ( Next to Regent Hotel, Opp Clark Hotel Road, SaraswathyMarg, Karol Bagh, New Delhi ).The Hotel is brand new and it shows. Rooms are small but neat and clean. The staff is very courteous and though the restaurant is not yet open, the Room service more than adequately makes up for it. The location is excellent and the room service is good.Since we are going to be staying in delhi for six days, it suits our budjet and serves our purpose. I would recommed this to all budjet travellers who are looking for a cozy nook in the centre of the city."
28,1672,"Sep 16 2009 	AVOID THIS HOTEL	I booked 2 nights at this hotel through expedia, the price included pick up from the airport which was important to me as a single female traveller. i received an e-mail from the hotel before I left for India confirming pick up however upon arrival at the airport there was no-one waiting for me. I contacted the hotel by telephone and was told to get a pre-paid taxi and they would pay for it. I did this however taxi driver was unable to find the hotel. It was 2 o'clock in the morning by this time and the area was deserted. We eventually found a travel agent who amazingly was still open. The agent did not know where the hotel was but let me use his phone to contact the hotel. I rang and asked if they could give the taxi driver directions however was informed that the hotel was full and they did not have a room for me. I explained I had booked and paid for my room and that I had spoken with someone earlier and explained the situation about the taxi and that I was a single female traveller. The person just kept saying they were full and then put the phone down on me. The taxi driver was going mad and said he wanted paying. I had no ruppees as I had expected the hotel to pay. The travel agent came to my rescue and I am not sure what I would have done without him. `he paid the taxi driver who just got my case out of the car and left me. The agent then contacted the hotel and found out where it was and went to the hotel and sorted a room for me. According to the agent it is common in India for hotels to say they have no rooms to people who have booked as a scam to get more money!!!. I eventually got to the hotel where they showed me 2 rooms to choose from (a plus side is that the room was big). I had to argue with them the next day to get the money back for the taxi. The whole experience was distressing, I do not know what would have happened to me if it were not for the kindness of the agent Rauf (PS his company is Le Nagooes Tour and Travel Company, Karol Bagh, email [--]) I think any hotel that would leave anyone in the position I was in should be avoided."
29,1672,"Sep 9 2009 	New hotel offering excellent value and service in bustling Karol Bagh.	Hotel Sunrise opened four months ago and, as such, seems to be an undiscovered budget gem in the heart of bustling Karol Bagh. I give 4 stars to service only because some local staff are still learning subtle aspects of room service; however, lobby management is very professional and was quite receptive to suggestions I offered concerning room service. In addition to running a spotlessly clean hotel, the hotel owners offer a wide range of other services in Delhi and around the country; these include custom travel packages to suit the wishes and desires of most customers. My wife and I come yearly to India and we will undoubtedly avail ourselves of the services offered at Hotel Sunrise!

1,1675,Feb 22 2009 	ok if you just need a place to sleep	rooms were clean.not a great area of town (far from the center).rooms are clean and beds are ok.breakfast is a disgrace and service rivals that.acceptable if you just need a clean place to sleep.
2,1675,"Nov 11 2008 	average decent place	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The rooms were clean. The ac was not working properly. when I told the management, they sorted that out quickly.The area karol baugh where this is situated..was noisy...and crowded.However there was a shopping area close to the hotel.There is a good eating place called Raffles.If someone is looking for a decent place but without spending too much I think this is good value for money."
3,1675,"May 29 2008 	Not too bad. Good location for Metro	Stayed here as it was a better location than some of the others. I have to agree it was noisy but this was due to other guests and not traffic. We had a room at the back on the 4th floor 405. Its perfectly acceptable but we did find our room unlocked on return so make sure you lock away your valuables or use the lockers in the managers office. If you leave the hotel and turn left at the front walk up the slight hill to the main road turn left and then right in 10 to 15 mins your at the Metro station Rajendra Place. The hotel business card has a small map on the back so its easy to find. Its a normal hassled walk but getting to connaught place is easy until late. The last train times are posted on the ticket booths. If you fancy coming back via tuk tuk use the pre pay booth in connaught place.Overall due to its locality to the Metro and the ease of getting to and from the city I'm recommending this hotel. The rooms were OK and clean. The shower was good and the bathroom was acceptable. AC worked. What more could i ask for. Price was 4452 rup around 53 for 2 nights. Sorry but no photos, i forgot."
4,1675,"Mar 25 2007 	Clean rooms horrible staff no windows noisy	The hotel seemed really ok at first glance, the room was clean, but ...The receptionist holds me back, saying &quot;my travel agent&quot; would be here in 2 minutes and wanted to see me about my stay in the hotel. Well, I had no travel agent, I booked the hotel through Internet.So the guy who shows up, tells me that he would be the final agent in the chain of companies through which my booking went. And of course tries to propose me excursions, additionnal services, etc... SCAM! After a few minutes he felt my mood about his presence and excused himself.I ask for a taxi at the reception, not sure if it was safe to hail one in the street at night. Of course, no problem. Well it was only three times the normal price (which I would not care so much as it was a proper, comfortable car), but it was not a taxi at all, just any private car (maybe the hotel's car that they rent out?). Guess doing taxi services without taxi license is also in India not exacly legal ...Back in my room I realise that the window is actually not a window but a window into a kind of ventilation shaft. The fan that would blow the air into that shaft (so no fresh air nto the room...) was so horribly loud that there was no way to leave it on at night.As an advantage from the airshaft you hear your neighbours as if they were in your room!Why some furniture had to be moved between midnight and 4 in the morning was a question the reception seemed unable to answer."
5,1675,Mar 9 2007	Stay If You Want To Be Ripped Off!!!	I stayed at this hotel in March 2007. I was quoted a price for an executive suite as they said this was all they had available. It was downstairs. At first I thought it was ok as seemed clean but the noise was awful as it was on the ground floor. The only thing was the noise was from the staff playing loud music and shouting to each other all night even when I asked them to be quiet. We asked if we could move rooms and they said we could move to a room upstairs but it would be more money - which I could not understand as they were smaller rooms. When we asked if we could move later to a cheaper room they said they were fully booked. I called the hotel later that day by phone and asked if they had rooms and how much they were - they quoted me 1500 rupees less than the price I paid and said they were available. When I went back to the hotel they tried to charge me more and on checking out were shouting abuse and all sorts. I would never stay at this hotel ever again and advise anyone NOT TO STAY HERE. We are Non resident Indians and they were looking to rip us off so I can only imagine what they do to tourists!!!!
6,1675,"Jan 21 2007	Great place	I stayed here several times while having to transit through Delhi and found it to be pretty good with minimal problems. The food was great, the service was prompt and the rooms were good. It's not for people desiring five star or even a good four star experience but it is a great choice for those looking for a nice three star place. The only downside is the neighborhood, Karol Bagh is quite chaotic and noisy....but then again all of Delhi is that way!!!!"
7,1675,"Jan 8 2007	Not sure this is the same as Sunstar Grand	I have been at Sunstar Grand. To comment on the previous review, I am not sure that Sunstar Grand and Residency are the same hotel. Looking at Sunstar Grand's website, it seems that Grand and Residency are two different hotels. They must be under the same ownership and close to each other, that's why it gets a bit confusing.I will post my review under Sunstar Grand."
8,1675,"Apr 18 2006	great value for the money	Also known as the &quot;Hotel Sunstar Grand&quot;. Marble floors and staircase. Nice older style with good furnishings and bed for this medium price range. Clean but worn linens, good service. Plenty of water pressure. Great rooftop terrace for breakfast if you get up early (only one shady table for the latecomers) thankfully breakfast is also cheerfully delivered to your room.[--]We paid US$50/night large double with AC. Have a local friend call and reserve the room in Hindi - you'll pay less ;)"
9,1675,"Mar 20 2006	Very good value for money	This place is a good surprise, especially if you have tried the terrible Ajanta hotel before!! Our room was large, clean, confortable, the bathroom huge with an amazing bathtub... The food was also excellent and service above average. I am going back there in few days and definitely recommend it !"
10,1675,"Dec 30 2005	Horrible Place	We stayed in Hotel Sunstar for 2 days in December and the experience was horrible. The room looked like a dungeom. Being in the busy Karol Bagh area, there is constant noice all night and several bugs allover the room. We were changed to a different room but it was only slightly better. Having paid an exhorbitant amont of money for COX and KINGS travel agency for out Delhi-Agra-Jaipur trip, we felt cheated. On requesting a different hotel, they told us to pay by ourselves, which we agreed. The travel agent called back witha hotel for 300$ saying thats the only hotel available in Delhi as it was a busy season. We checked on the Internet and got a great deal at the Grand for 125$ and there were tons of other hotels available.COX and Kings is an unreliable travel agent set to cheat unsuspecting foreigners (as we saw many Japanese staying in Hotel Sunstar).DONOT STAY THERE. DO YOUR RESEARCH. LOOK FOR DEALS. and dont become a walking ATM machine!"
1,1679,Nov 20 2009 	Live upto the expectations	I stayed there in Jan'08 for a about 3 days after my marriage and before my Honeymoon in Goa. The stay was very comfortable and most amazing part was where Hotel allowed my uncle to dress entire room with flowers (something which management was little reluctant earlier).Room was clean and room service prompt. The size of room was quite good and bathroom was very clean and spacious too.
2,1679,"Nov 18 2009 	NOTHING TO SHOUT ABOUT	over priced - US$144 twin room with an extra bed. / US$ 122 for a twin room.staff are friendly. breakfast is not bad. decent food ,both western and local.hotel is old. wifi is okay ,costly INR 200 per hour.overall ,i owuld be happier if i paid US$ 60 for the room.the tray charge came as a surprise."
3,1679,"Oct 6 2009 	Hotel Vikram	Hotel Vikram offers all the facilites you want. They are though a ona littl eexpensive side.I guess, for the tariff that they charge, you could easily tak eosme other luxurious hotel. Theer isnt anythign special . Teh locations doe not have any major scenic locale, no views etc..The place aslo is hoem to a lot of unwanted people (read :Prositutes etc) .You might run into some drunk men also.The good thing is the breakfast that they give. its a buffet &amp; really lavish . N really yummy!"
4,1679,"Aug 11 2009 	good value clean hotel but...	I had stayed there for one night and had some good sleep. It costs me around USD100, include breakfast, so quite good value. Very clean but it has no air con in the washroom and it is very hot this time round (36C. The control over the air con in the room is not function but luckily it has a very pleasant ceiling fan. Happy with its size and cleaniness.However very unprofessional receptionist with dirty hands and uniform, no smile and it seems bothering her when checking in. Usually they will let you get out of the lift first and they will follow when showing you to the room but this receptionist pushed me a bit and she get out first, this is rude! Dont eat western food like carbonara as it never looks like one although it is a simple crusine, asian food looks and taste better. Be careful, they charge you 200 rupees for an hour internet usae which I think is outragoues."
5,1679,"Jun 26 2009 	Felt myself like a Princess! :)	Hello! I traveled to India with my fianc in April, 2009. To say I liked it is to say nothing! May be the part of my excitement was the fact that I finally made it to the country of my dreams. The Vikram Hotel is in 10 min drive to the Lotus Temple. What I really liked is that there was a Travel Agent working at the hotel who helped us to arrange our trip to Agra and all the sightseeing tours (just Hotel taxi driver, no English speaking guide) around Delhi. He also booked our airline tickets to Kochi, Kerala. (Just for your information, know that there are two airports in Delhi  for Domestic flights and for international flights. These two are located in 15 min drive apart from each other). Hotel personnel was polite and friendly, rooms were surprisingly clean. Was impressed with Restaurant food and service. Kingfisher beer is the best! ? Of course there are many other hotels in Delhi you can choose from. But for me Vikram was the best place during our stay in Delhi. No doubt, I will choose it again if we will ever travel to Delhi again."
6,1679,Jun 19 2009 	A hotel in Delhi	A decent and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. Value for the money and the hotel is kept clean and maintained well. The staff are very cooperative and helpful. Very close to many business establishments and would suggest for people who do not want to spend more money on accommodation and want a good quality and comfortable stay in Delhi
7,1679,"Jun 13 2009 	Good facility	Had travelled to Delhi with a group of about 30 people on a business trip and was in charge of all the logistics arrangements. Hotel Vikram was recommended by the travel agent and visited it before confirming the booking. The rooms are very clean, freshly done up and comfortable. Specifically choose a carpeted room especially in winters as the rates are the sameStayed there for 3 days with the entire group and didnt face a single complaint from the guests. The food at the in-house restaurant is good and so is the room service. Just that the swimming pool was under maintainance during our stay.Location is very accessible and at walkable distance from the popular Lajpat Nagar market.All in all a good choice and fair value for money."
8,1679,"May 15 2009 	Best Location in Delhi	My friend told me about this hotel, it is value for money in everyway ie food,alchol,room etc so overall you dont end up spending much in the hotel.Quality of food is also vey good infact I had the best Indian food here.Staff is very helpful and best part is location its right next to all the bars, shopping and also work places......."
9,1679,"May 2 2009 	Average property..	The staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. Plenty of hot running water (which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor), but bed mattresses were old &amp; lumpy. The bathroom vent was woefully covered with plastic from the outside. The restaurant was decorated well which made it pleasing to the eye. The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotels stronger points. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again"
10,1679,"Feb 4 2009 	Budget hotel for 2 nights	This is one of those hotels with the archetypal Indian doorman, complete with giant moustache and turban. A nice touch when you first arrive but that novelty wears off. Metal detectors were installed at the entrance, but dont work. This set the standard for what was to come. The room was adequate though the immovable shower head was annoyingly weak, and being 6ft tall, I had to bend me knees in order to get under it. Being in the city, I can accept it being noisy in the night, but with the bathroom vent woefully covered with plastic from the outside, and pigeons coming and going, it wasnt pleasant. The bed was saggy and the sheets had seen better days. The restaurant was decorated well which made it pleasing to the eye. The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotels stronger points, with a fair selection at reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet was, in contrast, sparse and so could have done with more continental choices like pastries.There is no gym and the outdoor pool was closed in the winter season. For the 2 night stay we had, it was average, but I would be reluctant to stay there again, especially if it was any longer than 2 nights."
11,1679,"Sep 20 2008 	Brown shower water honking horns	The hotel is located near the hospital I was intending to visit, near Nehru Place. The hotel has a small restaurant, there are taxis available, and the hotel itself is no beter or worse than your average US economy hotel. They have a little garden out front, and the restaurant is clean. I did not like the noise of the cars honking all night long (the hotel is near a major street). The hotel itself is quiet, but apparently doesn't have double hung windows or soundproofing. There was a jalousie window in the bathroom that opened directly out onto the street which also made the bathroom hot and noisy compared to the room. The water ran brown in the bathroom the last day and the water temperature was tempramental during my visit. I used the dry cleaning service and they *washed* my wool business dress, ruining it. I would stay this is a fine hotel for a budget tourist trip, but I wouldn't stay here on business. If you stay here, bring ear plugs."
12,1679,"Mar 22 2008 	2 stars at best do not recommend	My Background: I am a frequent international business traveller (US, Europe, China &amp; India) and when on personal vacation, an adventure traveller (Europe, South America, Africa, APAC).Hotel Vikram Review:I would stay here if,- you are on a tight budget, looking for a below average hotel to stay- you are a local Indian business man, with non-western expectationsI wouldn't stay here if,- personal vacation in Delhi- business travel with western hotel expectations- with familyIn a nut shell, this hotel is 2 stars at best. Its safe, has AC (if it doesn't fail), clean bathroom and a comfortable bed. Its a very basic hotel. I recently travelled to Delhi for a trade show and stayed here because my local sales manager had booked us here. I had reserved a Luxury room, which is loosely defined. When I checked in, I asked for a non-smoking room, and was led to a room with a single bed (i.e. prison size bed). Apparently, all their non-smoking rooms have single beds - which is tucked away beside a wall that was fairly stained. I had immediately asked for another room with a double or queen size bed, but was told all rooms with larger beds are &quot;smoking&quot;. Since I was staying here for almost 5 nights, I wanted a decent size bed to sleep in so I braved the smoking room. It turned out to be ok, with no distinct smoking smell. The carpets in the room are quite old and worn, and not overly clean. The bed is comfortable, but the clean staff for some reason always wrap the comforter (the covering that never gets changed!) around the pillows, which makes the pillows not very appealing to sleep on. The sheets are well worn, and have stains that cannot be washed out. The rooms do not have ironing boards or an iron, so you have to dial room service to get one every morning - which usually takes 30-45 minutes to arrive (i think they must only have one and its shared among all the guests every morning!!). When it does arrive, the iron is from the 60's, and is basically a piece of metal with a handle and an electric cord. It does not steam, etc. like a modern iron. The ironing board is heavily yellow stained (like someone urinated on it). The bathroom is quite small but usable. My room in particular did not have running cold water in the sink. The shower has good water pressure. Half way through my stay, the motor of my room's AC died in the middle of the night, so I had to change room again (3 times in total within 5 days). Every room has wireless Internet, but the connection is quite slow. A week's worth of Internet is 1500 Rs, but if you put it from the front desk (instead of online), its a bit cheaper. The staff is generally friendly. The restaurant downstairs is not bad, although the breakfast is quite basic. By default, they serve you instant coffee, so you need to ask for &quot;black espresso&quot;, in which case they brew it from a machine. The Indian food in the restaurant is pretty good, as I ate there a few evenings after long days. Room service is efficient and quick. The hotel has a Tourist desk that can arrange tours to Taj Mahal. It'll cost you 4200 Rs to hire a private car and driver. A guide will cost another 500 Rs (which you paid to the guide directly). The drive to Agra/Taj Mahal is about 3-4 hours, so leave early (6am). Would I go back again? No. However, my expectations might be different than others, so if you are looking for a 2-star quality hotel, than Hotel Vikram is fine. But if you are a westerner travelling on company business, I would recommend you stick to a western chain hotel. The location of hotel is irrelevant as you have to take a cab everywhere anyway in Delhi generally. The noise level outside the hotel is pretty loud - I can always hear frequent car honks and dogs barking in my room, so if you are a light sleeper, you might have trouble sleeping.I hope this helps the next person make their choice. I paid 8500 Rs for my room. Hotels in Delhi are generally expensive due to lack of rooms and high demand. Bare in mind that price of a hotel room does not necessary reflect its quality like it normally does in North America or Europe."
13,1679,"Dec 29 2007 	Reasonable value - we would go again	My family (2 Adults and 2 Children) stayed at the Vikram at the end of October 2007 for 10 days. Having previously been in India in 2002 and at the time, for what was then called the Marriott Hotel (its name has changed now- can't remember what) we paid 60 room only, we were now alarmed to find that an average room in a 5* hotel was 220+ per night. We therefore decided to go for a cheaper option, bearing in mind we could run into problems with this decision!!!However, we were pleased to find that the Vikram is a clean and friendly hotel. It is about a 20 minute taxi ride from the centre of Delhi (depending on traffic conditions). We negotiated Rs 10,000 per night for a luxury room including 2 extra beds and breakfast. In all honesty we have to say it equalled the 5* hotel we previously stayed in if you are a tourist. (In fact the luxury room was larger than the room we stayed at in the Marriott )If you are looking for a clean hotel in Delhi at a reasonable cost, then the Vikram is fine. In the UK it easily exceeds Travelodge, Premier Lodge etc. However - for room service the alcohol was expensive - especially wine!!!The swimming pool was dry in October and we are not sure when it will be refilled. If you are looking for a reasonable price, then we would have no hesitation in recommending the Vikram. Remember 4* in the UK isn't necessarily 4* in India - it is perfectly adequate."
14,1679,Sep 5 2007	Could do a lot worse	We spend a bit of time in Delhi on business and have stayed in a number of hotels. Whilst I agree that there are some problems with the hotel (yes the staff aren't very friendly) it feels much more homely than all others in the City. The snacks in the bar are terrific (try the chili chicken) and it's a great place for a quiet beer after a full on day in the hustle and bustle that is Delhi. There are some interesting walks around the hotel into what I presume to be fairly up market areas with their own common gardens and the market is mightily impressive (if you're into shopping).
15,1679,"Apr 9 2007 	Expensive	We stayed in a superior room between 02 March and 07 March 2007. The room was spacious and stylishly furnished. Room service food was good and was also reasonably priced. The only problem though was that the front-desk staff was very unfriendly and very unhelpful. In addition, the location is not ideal. It is about a 30min drive by tuk-tuk to Connaught Place and the main shopping and tourist areas. Overall the hotel was ok, but we felt that it was not value for money and would probably not stay at this hotel in the future."
16,1679,"Dec 17 2006 	Value for Money	I had a comfortable stay at the Vikram, Delhi. Hotel is situated in Lajpat Nagar, just off the Ring Road which is the main arterial road of Delhi, making it easier to travel around. Although the immediate surroundings doesn't have much to offer.The lobby is bit on the smaller side but adequate seating is available for it's size. Check-in was fast but not very friendly.Room was adequate in size for a hotel in this class. Bed was comfortable and TV had most of the cable channels. Bathroom was good. The window didn't offer much of a view.Breakfast was good and plentiful. Breakfast area was pretty neat and it also had a large Plasma display. Service was okay.Overall, a good experience though the hotel is more of 3 star class rather than 4 star as it claims to be."
17,1679,"Nov 21 2006 	great for this price range	In Delhi you can either spend $200 plus for a luxury hotel, or take a risk at the lower ranges and hope for the best. We wanted the Ambassador which is very centrally located but they were booked, so we tried Hotel Alka- bad choice- don't stay there!!In the morning we packed our bags and went searching for something better and ended up at Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar. It's about 20 min or so from Connaught, etc, but close to the Lotus Temple and other sites, and Greater Kailash which has great shopping and restaurants, as well as the Lajpat Nagar market which is very good, much better prices then downtown.The hotel has recently been refurbished so the carpets and rooms are new and very nice, and the bathroom was small but nicely done, even better than the Taj Mahal bathrooms. The staff was very kind and helpful and we were thrilled to find it after our terrible experience at Alka.Not good for wondering around outside, but good for a safe haven after an intense day in the city. It's clean, nice, and friendly, and not too far from the airport (always depending on traffic)"
18,1679,"Apr 21 2006	So so hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Vikram hotel twice during April 2006. It is described as a 4 star hotel but is no better than a very average 3 star hotel. The rooms were O.K. (television, air conditioning etc) but hot water was temperamental and twice I had to take a cold shower. Buffet breakfast was rather bland and the options limited. Hotel bar was small and pokey but the drinks and snacks were well priced. Check in was efficient but not very friendly. On the plus side the hotel was clean and safe and was conveniently located close to the Locus Temple, Qutb Minar and the South Extension Markets. Overall not a bad place to stay as long as you are not paying 4 star rates"
19,1679,"Jan 15 2006	OK	Room was clean and comfortable enough, but bathroom window had no screen and was covered by some sort of tarp from the outside! Neighborhood is not nice, not a place to be walking around. Service was adequate. Even though proximity to major tourist sites is good on the map, it took a long time to get to anything."
20,1679,"Jan 9 2006	Go somewhere else.	Although rated as 4-star in India, this was definitely not a 4-star hotel. The staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. Plenty of hot running water (which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor), but bed mattresses were old &amp; lumpy. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again."
21,1679,"Jan 22 2005	Pristine refuge in the heart of Delhi	We recently spent three nights at the Hotel Vikram and had a wonderful time. Rooms were spotless and comfortable, an ideal refuge after a day of sightseeing -- furnishings were new and tasteful, shower and bathroom extraordinarily clean, and traffic noise minimal. Service was impeccable, from the front desk to the travel desk and hotel drivers to the very efficient room service. Breakfast was also quite good, with a good selection of continental and Indian specialities. Convenient location too. Great value, excellent hotel!"
22,1679,Feb 10 2009 	Nettes Hotel sehr guter Service im Restaurant...
1,1680,Mar 12 2009	Pathetic Hotel	Hotel WELCOME PALACE IS A PATHETIC HOTEL..mR miglani owner of this hotel is a cheat..All commitments are false.Beware of this hotel.they are fraud
2,1680,"Nov 13 2008 	The WRONG hotel welcome palace!	My buddy and I were working in Indonesia, and decided to take a weekend trip to see the Taj. He began researching places to stay, and came upon one online that looked great (hotelwelcomepalace.net). When he booked it, he accidentally went to hotelwelcomepalace.com, and we ended up here.When we arrived, weary from our flight and ordeal with customs around 3 am. We knew to expect to bargue for everything, but nothing would prepare us for this place. This place was very &quot;it's ok...&quot; about everything. For instance, we asked for a couple sealed bottles of water, and we got refilled bottles. &quot;It's OK...&quot; yeah, no can we please get some SEALED bottles... &quot;grumble....&quot;Being from the west, we were suspicious of them wanting to hold our passports, and I think they decided to get back at us for that. So they showed us to our room. Dirty walls, floors, bathroom was ok, but we were just like, well it's India, we will survive, just staying one night then off to Agra....We had to bargue to get ourselves an extra matress for the floor (my bud had asked for a room w/ two beds, we got a single queen haha). Finally, after we were situated and had just fallen asleep, they come banging on the door to move us to a different room. 3 or 4 floors up. In the middle of the night! TO AN EVEN DIRTIER NASTIER SMALLER ROOM!!!!! My friend and I looked at each other as soon as they left the room, and decided to not even try with this place. We just walked downstairs, told them to call us a cab and checked out of this worthless place.We ended up just splurging and staying at the Intercontinental! Much more expensive, but after this ordeal, the cleanliness and courtesy and amenities were worth the high price.Please, whatever you do, doublecheck your web address before you book!"
3,1680,Oct 13 2008 	A distaster	This hotel is really very bad. I strongly reccomend to avoid it.
4,1680,"Jun 30 2008 	Liked it	Was there in late evening. Our Id was asked at the hotel and then transfered to room after check in which was express and took 5min only.By the time welcome drink was served. After check in 2 bottles of mineral water was served with fruit basket to our room. We were hungry when we checked in the hotel so ordered the dinner which was served in 15min, &amp; we really enjoyed the food. Next day on asking hotel for sightseeing hotel arranged it for 3 days. Delhi Sight Seeing/ Agra same day tour &amp; shimla 2 days. We hired the cab from hotel at 7 Rs. km which was new santro. Hotel had free internet for there all guests staying.Hotel have just opened there Resturant which was upto 12 mindnite &amp; room service 24 hrs.Hotel had electric back up too. Staff was very very friendly &amp; obiedient. Over all liked it very much."
5,1680,"Mar 25 2008 	Avoid at all costs!!	Please, please PLEASE do not stay at this hotel!! If you already made reservations, cancel them!!!I stayed here for two nights, but looking back I cannot believe I stayed there that long.The first room we were in was very dirty, had holes in the wall, and no windows! After inspecting the room further we found rat droppings on the nightstand and on the floor. We figured, whatever we are in india you just deal with it, but later on when the rat actually appeared from the wall we couldn't handle it anymore. We asked to be switched to a different room, after management made us feel stupid for asking such a ridiculous request. Our next room was nicer, but the bathroom had only a trickle of running water and the window overlooked a very noisy and highly used alleyway. The first night we were there, a musical performance went on all night outside of our window. We would have moved the next night to a different hotel but seeing as we got 2 hours of sleep the night before and had spent ALL day traveling to and from the Taj, we really just wanted to get to bed.I never took my socks off the whole time because the floors were so gross... in fact i threw them out before coming home. The management also changed our rates upon checking out. We had a pre booked rate from the manager of the hotel but when we checked out they added a bunch of taxes that we were never told of, even though our pre booked rate supposedly included all taxes.Please, do not stay here. There are plenty of other hotels in the area, and make sure to ask to see the room before you stay there!!!"
6,1680,"Dec 25 2007 	Avoid this place!	I join the opinion of the others - it was a horrible experience. The rooms were horrible. Staff was sooo rude! They also had organised airport transportation for us even though we didn't even talk abt that with them and then afterwards tried to charge us for that! The rooms were horrible soo dirty and disgusting, + only cold water etc. I also agree one who wrote that I don't think the rooms had ever been cleaned.. After one night in the morning one of the staff members is knocking our door and says that we need to change our room that it's booked to some other people. Excuse me?? Then this guy tells that the room that we had booked wasn't available when we arrived so we had a got better one..Yeah right! A better one can this get any worse even.. In the end we just left from the hotel and moved to another one. I do think that the best area to stay is Paharganj - there you can find much selection. It might be a messy area but it's located also perfectly. Easy access to metro."
7,1680,"Nov 6 2007 	Disliked the attitude of the employees the most	We have just returned from a trip to new delhi. We stayed in this hotel for most of the time and had the worst experience there! When we first checked in, we asked for the exact pricing of the rooms and cabs etc... so that we don't get conned later on. We then arranged for a cab to take us to the train station the next day and a wake up call at 4:30 am. The next day, we wake up at 4:45 because there was no wake up call! When we finish pack up our things and go downstairs at the reception, we find that no taxi has been arranged! When we ask the manager, he tells us nothing has been written in the books! He then arranges a taxi for us and bills us Rs 750 for it instead of the Rs 500 that he told us before and says that he is giving the 'big' cab!When we returned from our trip from kanpur, we waited at the platform 12 of the train station for a person with a board with our names( this also was arranged earlier with the hotel) After waiting for 15 minutes and seeing that no one is coming, we decided to arrange for the cab ourselves and return to the hotel. Now on the day that we are returning ( i.e. checking out) the bill contains 1 taxi for the day at the train station together with parking costs etc... when we were not even provided this service from them! Then, for the cab to go to the airport he charges more than he agreed upon beforehand.Then, another thing i did not like at all in this hotel is the fact that the waiters keeps pestering us for giving them tips. When we first checked in, being all guys, we carried our luggage to our rooms ourselves, however, the waiters would just come to our rooms with towels, and i don't know for what reasons and stay there for long time waiting for their tips! One of them even asked me directly if we are going to give them something before going! That shocked me the most! A tip is given if you think that the service was good and it shows that we liked it, but these guys make it seem as if that the tip is compulsory whatever the type of service you get!Finally, i would not recommend anyone to go and stay in this hotel unless you like to be ripped off and conned! This place has its location as its only good point, the attitude of the people over there are just disgusting! The rooms are very badly maintained with no hot showers and badly done electrical installation!"
8,1680,"Nov 4 2007 	The worst you could get	Don't be fooled by the name of the Hotel... You would neither be welcomed properly... nor it is a Palace whatsoever... In fact, it's the total opposite...I don't know if the owner ever says anything true in his words... Everything you ask is &quot;OK&quot; but without any concrete actions... No wake up calls that has been confirmed on the eve by him...Cabs... lol, I could write a book about this part... Well, in brief... Cabs scheduled on the eve are nowhere to be found at the said time! Tadaaaaaa!!! The owner didn't write it in whatever book! And the price... once he knows you got no other choice than taking the cab he would propose because of time constraint, the price keeps on rising...The rooms are among the worsts I've ever seen... I've been to many hotels with the same budget or even less... but this one is one of a kind... The electric wiring seems so dangerous, just mere connections between wires... Beware, you could be electrified! The hot showers were never hot... even if you asked them to put the roof boiler on... I wonder if the bedsheets, glasses, bathroom are ever really cleaned...Well the only good thing in choosing this hotel is that it is near the Metro and the shopping area of Karol Bagh...But if I were you, and want value for money, I would avoid it at all costs!!!P.S. Beware of the lift also! It can close on your limbs!!! Better you climb up the stairs to your floor... You've been warned... ;)"
9,1680,"Nov 4 2007	Not satisfied with management	At first, the person at the desk appeared to be gentle. That was the first impression I personally had. Indeed the hotel was not bad but not very good neither.There is one pc connected to the internet which is an advantage. But unfortunately, it was not working one day..so couldn't really send some important emails.The rooms were ok for 2 persons. However, having a hot shower is a problem. It was pure luck to sometimes have hot water and sometimes not.The advantage of the hotel is that it is really near the metro stationand a street where we made a lot of shopping.Restaurants are very near too. But it can get really noisy at night.However, the service at reception was not really good and had a bad experience with them. No promised wakeup call, no cab in the morning and no cab at the train station. However, we were charged heavily for those..which unfortunately did somehow exceeded our budget."
10,1680,"Nov 3 2007 	Disliked the crooked attitude of the management	We stayed in Hotel Welcome palace on the 25th-26th October 2007 and then, from 29th October till 1st November 2007.We asked the owner to give us a wake up call at 430 on the 26th and arrange for a cab @500. We had an early flight to catch. We also asked for a cab to pick us up from the train station on the 29th. TheHotel manager noted our requests. I asked him about the price for thecab, and it was Rs 500. The next morning, no wake up call, no cab waiting for us. There was a different person at the frontdesk and he said that the cab would cost Rs 750. When I protested, he said that ishould discuss with the other guy when am back. On the 29th, there was no cab waiting for us at the train station. We take a cab on our own, since none of the requests we had made earlier were not satisfied. When we arrive at the hotel, the manager says the driver is waiting for us at station.When I asked him for fare for a sight seeing trip, there was the basic Rs 2800 + additional fares for driver, which was not defined.On checking out, the bills were NOT what we had agreed on - the firstcab was 750 instead of the 500 he had promised. He claims that he gave us a big cab. He was charging for the cab that was never there plus he was charging Rs 850 for dropping us to the airport (compared to the 550 he had said earlier).On top of that, there was NO hot water for taking shower, when asked,front desk would say it would be activated in 10 mins - but alas, only vain promises. The bed sheets were not clean - looked like someone had been sleeping in those before. We were 2 in a room, but they consistently provided only one towel daily.You may stay at the hotel, but get all expected costs in writing fromthe beginning. Do NOT go by the manager's words, as he will findsome good excuse to charge you more - unless you have a lot of money to spare and do not really care about being cheated upon."
11,1680,"Aug 26 2007 	OK room but sneaky Management	Recently we stayed at Hotel Welcome Palace at Gurudwara road. Few observations that others may find useful. Hotel is located near Karol Bagh shopping area. Some good food joints are near by. Considerable traffic outside, so it can get noisy in the room.1. Stayed at the Family suite, their most expensive offering. It's a nice, large room with two double beds, sitting area, TV with many channels, fridge, and attached bathroom. Room decor was good. Both AC units worked well. 2. Even though the room has a refrigerator, it works only when you deposit your room key in a key-holder. Once you remove the key from its holder to leave the room, electricity is automatically cut off. A warning in case you plan to keep perishables in the refrigerator.3. Bathroom is not well maintained. Some fixtures are missing. Towels are old and worn out. Hot water is available, but you have to call. 4. Hotel breakfast is terrible. We ordered the very basic: eggs, toast, butter, jam etc. They don't have a cafeteria; so they brought the food to our room. Presentation was poor. You are better off eating in nearby restaurants.5. I could not make local phone calls from the room. I called the front desk couple of times, but they couldn't fix it. For some reason, the outgoing calls are disabled at the front desk.6. Instead of providing honest and transparent service, the management seems keen to wring every rupee from their customers. I found this so irritating that next time I will take my business elsewhere. Some examples:---- We agreed for an amount so the hotel could arrange a vehicle to pick us up from the International airport. I knew the amount was excessive, but I agreed since we were reaching at night. The vehicle was in poor condition (busted wind shield, seat covers / interior in poor condition, non-existent shock absorbers). When checking out, I discovered that they had added parking fee, airport entry fee, night duty fee etc to the charge. These additional charges were removed when I protested. ---- The hotel website advertises complimentary breakfast. We ordered it on the first day. Found it terrible. In any case, the waiter asked me to sign off on a bill. As I suspected, it showed up in my hotel bill on the final day. I had to talk to their 'Director' to get the charges removed. He claimed ignorance when I asked why they charge for the complimentary breakfast. My guess is that they will charge and hope the customer pays. They will roll it back if you complain.---- On our first day, I had asked the hotel to arrange a AC car to take us around Delhi. Even though they charge a pretty good amount, they arrange lousy cars. On a hot / humid day, the AC barely worked. Car broke down several times during the day. It leaked coolant. When I asked the car driver to take us to the Humayun tomb, his response was that there wasn't much to see. My guess is that this hotel tries to arrange low quality cars so they can pay out less and make as much profit as possible. When I complained about quality of their cars, 'Director' apologized and tried to make amends by reducing the rental charge. Overall, our room was ok; but the management is sneaky. They seem unaware that in the age of Internet, they can gain / lose customers with a few mouse clicks. You are probably better off taking your business somewhere else."
12,1680,"Aug 17 2007 	I think you have all been rating the wrong hotel	My fiance and I read these reviews, and thought, WOW, such amazing reviews, and so high in the Delhi hotels ranking, we cant go wrong for the price!!!!!But we did! For one thing, there are 2 Welcome palace hotels in Delhi, and the one in THIS review is the one we stayed in.We booked 3 nights in a double room with ensuit, for 800 rupees a night online. We turned up and were given a shoe box, with no AC, no towels, and no loo roll. (Apparently these 3 rooms are the ones advertised on the hostel and hotel websites for 800, but are actually used for staf to stay in) We were then expected to tip 3 bell boys who all jamp at the chance to grab our 2 rucksacks, to take up 1 flight of stairs to the room. Which we had to do, as they just hung around and waited for their tip.Around 5 mins later, another bell boy appeared knocking at the door bringing toilet roll, expecting a tip (i didnt know it was a luxury to expect loo roll?) We then decided for 800 rupees we should be in a better hotel with AC, but were tierd, so we upgraded. We were then shown every room in the property, ranging from our room being the worst, to 5 bed 'delux' rooms. we upgraded to AC, costing 1250 a night, and once again, we were expected to tip 2 bell boys for taking our rucksacks accross the landing. Later on in the evening, we had another knock from the same bell boy, bringing us a towel, and again, would not leave the room, and folded the towel twice waiting for a tip. This then continued for the rest of the stay, we would arrive back after a hot sweaty day of sightseeing, our room would not have been serviced, and after jumping in the shower, up to 4 knocks at the door till 9.30pm with porters bring various things, loo roll, soap, another towel??Its a pity, you get free internet, and the metro is close, and this whole area is much more peaceful than in town, with nice places to eat and shop, and to be fair, a little cheaper and we would have been happy, but they really need to sort out those porters, they made us feel terrible, sad eyed and dirty,. hanging around.We have now moved to another hotel.Stay here by all means, as the area has everything you need, but I would nip the bell boy issue in the bud before you even close your hotel room door!"
13,1680,"Jun 5 2007 	Best Stay we had!	I stayed at Welcome Palace for three nights in May with my Wife and eighteen year old daughter. The staff was very friendlier,polite &amp; attentive. We were on the First floor say the Executive Floor of the Hotel. Unlike some hotels there was not a hint of stuffiness or formality there. My daughter was very happy to be there &amp; felt as valued as my wife and I. Food was of our high standard, service without fault. The rooms are extremely comfortable, with great views. Best Part was it was near to all Shopping Areas &amp; Metro. Added to all the above a good location then I cannot think of a better place to stay in New Delhi."
14,1680,"May 18 2007 	Just Fine	I stayed at the hotel at the beginning and end of my trip to India. After booking the hotel, I inquired as to whether or not they could arrange a full itinerary, which they did. I got all hotels (I specified), an air conditioned car and driver for 6 days, airport transfers and breakfasts for about $450 which was quite a bargain. They did a good job in setting it all up.The hotel is basic and as a one time Peace Corps volunteer, I found it met all my needs. The plumbing worked, as did the a/c. The bed was comfortable and there was cable tv. The staff was helpful and friendly and, while there was no restaurant, there was room service and breakfast was delivered to the room (included).The main drawback was the location which was not familiar to many rickshaw or taxi drivers, but I discovered that this lack of knowledge was true for all but the most famous places. The area was chaotic and noisy but the room was fairly quiet. One can walk to Conaught Place in about half an hour and the rail station is very near. At a daily rate of about $25, it was a good choice"
15,1680,"Apr 27 2007 	Good travel centre shame about the rat	We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007. Generally the reception area was OK and the staff reasonably helpful. However, the sheets on the bed had already been slept in and there were some fairly unsavoury bugs in the bathroom. Breakfast was OK but took ages to come and you have to eat it in the lobby (which is where I saw the rat). However, the travel desk was excellent and arranged a car for the whole day to take us round to see the town. Unfortunately my friends had a bad experience in a taxi that was arranged by the travel desk but I guess they couldn't help that.Overall I would say that this hotel is acceptable if you are on a budget but I think I would try my luck somewhere else next time."
16,1680,"Jan 12 2007 	wonderful relaxing place	stayed at this amazing place called welcome palace.. where everything is easy to get food, travel nice executive suite,any help any time. this is in heart of city, good shoppin place around mc donalds, sravan bahvan all good food joints and food of welcome palace rocks.. .. was there for vacations after very long and i think had wonderful time... vacations was fun like never before,,, all the best to welcome palace and their vry vry helpful employees . keep it up...Mili"
17,1680,"Nov 14 2006	Amazing Staff make this hotel excellent!	We just returned from a fabulous three weeks touring beautiful India where we spent a total of 5 nights at the Welcome Palace Hotel, divided into two different segments. The Welcome Palace staff made us feel like family each time we arrived, arranged for our transportation with flawless efficency, made sure we found the best restaurants and even took us shopping to their secret favorite shops. (And these wern't the tourist trap places) Their insight and friendly manner was so valuable. The hotel itself is clean and spacious.They provided ample hot water (once we figured out how to turn it on), bottled water to drink and the room service was very good. The shinning star here is the staff.....all wonderful, friendly and helpful. I'd recommend the Hotel Welcome Palace to anyone looking for an affordable, clean and friendly hotel to make your stay in India a five star experience."
1,1681,Jun 6 2009	Comfortable stay	if u wanna live in delhi close to the airport and closer to gurgaon then it is a good place to stay.....comfortable rooms.
2,1681,"Oct 13 2008 	bad worst	hiThis hotel is quite close to airport but hotel is really bad, customer service is bad and they have no proper manner, not up to the standard not a 4 star hotel. hotel rooms are very bad. ho heater no proper AC. bathroom is really bad, very very small and dirty. they didn't bother to clean it. couldnot even open the window as the passer by can see inside. it ruined our honeymoon trip as we didn't expect delhi 4 star hotel to be like this not worth even star. food was bad. people in the hotel were bad and not friendly. did not fulfill our requirments even after asking them n number of times. this was the only hotel horrible in our honeymoon as rest of the hotel we booked turned out to be excellent."
3,1681,"Aug 20 2007 	Try to find another hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights waiting for transfer to Cochin and by our travelagents mistake 2 nights more on the way back to Sweden. It was very run down, dirty bathrooms and with a sad looking staff working there. The descrition on the hotels website is far away from the true experience, be prepaired to be unable to sleep the nights you stay here. The hotel are built like a echo chamber, every little noise from the rooms or the reception (phones, staff make dishes/cleaning middle of the nigth) go straight into your room. There was bad smell in our rooms, no windows and very dark inside. Actually we felt ill from staying here, and felt better as soon as we had a possibilty to leave the hotel. As we staid during monsoon season we where worried that the roof should fall down, as huge amounts of water was pouring straight through the roof covering the eco chamber outside the rooms. So our advice: try to find another hotel in Delhi, the only favourible thing to say is that the hotel are very close to the airport, wich make it possible to make sure to be able to cach your departure even if the monsoon have hit Delhi badly (as it had upon our leaving)."
4,1681,"Apr 25 2007	A basic hotel	Delhi has gone haywire with hotel pricing, so what you could get for a small budget even a year ago can not be found today. The Westend Inn is a very basic hotel. It's generally clean, but make sure you get a renovated room on the side across from the pool. Some fixtures (like the soap dish in the bathroom) are broken, but the bed is comfortable, sheets are clean, the phone works, there's a tv, etc. Westerners should keep in mind that this is India, what you might get in the US is not going to be the case here-no bathtubs for example. The hotel staff speaks limited english (be prepared for that in in India in general) so if you want something complex, the only answer you'll get is yes, but you won't really get what you want. The wifi is a joke-it didn't work for the majority of the time we there, but then again this is an India issue in general. The rooms on the second floor have better wifi reception. The business center is not a business center and again internet only sometimes work. The westend inn is not as horrific as some other reviews make it out to be, but don't expect a 5 star experience, don't expect a US 3 star experience either for that matter either. And regarding mosquitos, you're in India, they are going to exist and if it's rained recently, they are going to be out in force. Don't open your windows and ask for the repellent plug in you see advertised all over India.The food is pretty decent here and cheap. Room service is not so great-food was terrible, but the buffet at the restaurant was good as were several of the other items we ordered off the menu. All in all, a decent experience."
5,1681,"Mar 2 2007	Stay Away!	Very bad experience. Stay away. Hotel employees kept asking for tips and wouldn't leave the room until i've paid them. More specifically, I called the hotel desk to arrange a taxi to the airport because i thought a hotel arranged taxi would be more trustworthy. When i got to the airport, the Taxi driver asked for 300 Rs. I knew it should cost less than 150Rs to the domestic airport because i came from there the night before. I gave him 200 Rs. The next thing i heard is that the hotel charged an additional 300 Rs on my roommate 's bill when he checked out for this taxi service."
6,1681,Feb 17 2007	Favourable	I have recently returned from Delhi where I visited along with some 40 others as part of a cricket tour.Before leaving we were all alarmed at the reports on TripAdvisor.However after our stay of some 10 days the reports were generally unfair.Our party found the Hotel clean and well maintained (some building work is in porgress to part of the building) and the staff to be very courteous and helpful.The reports about airport noise are clearly wrong.The only downside is the location which is isolated from other facilities and involves an adventure in the Delhi traffic.
7,1681,"Dec 23 2006 	Avoid if possible	Stayed here for one night en route back to the UK. I didn't pay for the room myself, but was aware of how much it cost. For the price, I have to say I was expecting a lot better.Start with the positives: room was spacious, and the marble floor gave a sense of luxury. Then the negatives: the furniture was a little bit worn, and somewhat dusty. The bathroom was very poor, the walls had patches of mildew and the fittings were covered in limescale. The toilet, even though it had the &quot;sanitary seal&quot; on it, had clearly not been cleaned with a toilet brush. The windows were covered in dust.However, the worst problem was the noise. The room overlooked a small internal courtyard that was being used as a &quot;utility&quot; area, and the staff were washing dishes late into the night. I put up with this, despite being woken up by the noise at 1230AM and about 115AM. When it happened again, at 230AM, I called the reception. The attitude of the duty manager (I think) was not helpful; he suggested that I was imagining things (I could see the pile of washed crockery out my window), and then said he was &quot;socked&quot; (sic) that this happened etc. At 230AM, with a flight to catch the next day, I came close to &quot;socking&quot; him myself :-) I saw him go down there, and things quietened down, but started again at 7AM.For what it's worth, a colleague stayed in the same hotel a few days earlier and found it fine. There are apparently &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; rooms, maybe I got the old rooms."
8,1681,"Dec 11 2006 	Nightmare	Missed a flight out of Delhi airport and scrambled for a place to stay. Airport staff pronounced this &quot;Westin&quot; -- imagine my surprise! A true nightmare. I had to laugh that they called the room I got a &quot;super deluxe suite.&quot; The shower was made of three glass walls that joined with about an inch gap between them AND NO CAULK. A shower flooded the place entirely. Internet did not work. Guests were hoodlums. Food at the restaurant was abysmal. I'm pretty sure there were fleas in the bed. Took them 2h to send a car to the airport to get me, and every time I called they said it would be there in 5 minutes. Stay away!"
9,1681,"Oct 17 2006 	Worst Service Worst rooms Avoid at all costs	We stayed here because a travel agent booked us in saying it is a 4 star.1. Check in was pathetic, they always give a bad room first. They will change to better room after you complain.2. They will say no payment was made by travel agent; but that was not always the case &amp; makes your checkout longer.There seem to be preferential treatment to foreigners for some odd reason."
10,1681,"Oct 12 2006	Fewer stars than you might expect!	We were part of a British group booked into this hotel for two nights while touring Delhi. This was a change from our original hotel itinerary in the Delhi area -- and it was somewhat disappointing. On the plus side, it is close to the airport. But in most regards it is not up to strong standards if you are looking for a four or five star hotel. This is two or three stars in Paris at best (and yet it is far from any tourist sites and shopping). The dining room food was adequate, although some in our group went hungry (not liking the few choices). Breafast selections especially were limited. The pool is fine and lovely in the afternoon, but sunset does bring mosquitoes (be sure to have and use your spray). The English language is a challenge for some of the staff, so communication can be humorous or frustrating. The property itself is not bad and has potential. However, some aspects of the rooms are rundown and needing more diligent and regular ongoing maintenance. The hotel is in three buildings. One has a lift, the other two (on two floors each) do not (just so you know). Overall, this hotel was a disappointing ending to our week in India -- our other hotels, in Agra and Jaipur, had been so very much nicer, cleaner, and better run."
11,1681,"Apr 22 2006 	Nightmare. Avoid at all cost	I am an Indian living in the US. I am extremely patriotic and proud of India. But this is not about India, just a WARNING about this hotel.I was transiting via Delhi and had to spend the night. The airport counter recommended this hotel and gave me a ride to the place.- Check in went on well- Noticed a party going on in one of the rooms with loud music and over 50 guests and called the front desk if they knew about a party and when it would end. The sound was reverberating since the rooms were all facing an open center area and the volume was way up on the powerful sound system.- Response: &quot;No we don't, there is no party&quot;. (Hmm that's an odd response right?? )- By around 10:30 PM it was getting louder and the children were running around knocking on doors waking people up.- This triggered a whole bunch of guests (mostly people transiting and spending just the one night weary and tired) to come out of there rooms and complain.- Now the staff said they knew about a scheduled &quot;Reception party&quot; in one of the rooms and did not let people know during check in and that they cannot ask the people to reduce their noise &quot;since they were in their room&quot;.For crying out loud, there are over 50 people spilling out of the room, loud music reverberating and children running around knocking on all doors.Its very odd that a hotel would ignore all their guest for a party. It may very well be that they got a whole bunch of money for it, but shouldn't a hotel of this standard live up to it. The party went on till well over 2:00 AM. In spite of guests complaining and simply too tired from their travel do walk out of the hotel.Now don't even get me started on the service at &quot;breakfast&quot;, where there were over 8 staff helping around 10 guests, where two of them were ganging up on an American guest for taking a second cup of coffee. Apparently each time you take anything, they need to note it down and put it on your tab.Back at the airport, I asked the same counter which recommended this place and found that a lot of people have bad experience at this place and that they are forced to recommend this place since the owners are politically connected.Now i truly believe that all the &quot;Stars&quot; that this place may have or get, is all because of the political connections."
12,1681,"Apr 22 2006	stay away	very run down, dirty and mosquito ridden - don't believe the non-smoking policy, there are no non-smoking rooms and they all smell of stale cigarettes. The front half of the attached building is collapsing, half demolished, looks like an earthquake zone. Definitely not 4* quality but if you can get a really, really cheap deal it's manageable for one night. Buffet was disorganized but OK. Yes it's close to airport but nothing else is."
13,1681,"Nov 11 2005	Worse hotel experience in 20 years...	On the basis of description found on the web, I expected to have 2 relaxing nights in a hotel with small garden and swimming pool. In fact, the only positive facts about it are: (1) it is close to the Airport (indeed, you hear the planes) and (2) it has a swimming pool (which you may not need so much if your aim is to sleep...). In short, a collection of the worst imaginable:- doors are paper thin, and windows have single pane which, as the hotel is next to a major highway, means constant traffic noise, and full 'perception' of hotel noises as well - in fact, we did not sleep for more than 50% of the nights we spent there...- staff is at best strange, usually fully dismal: receptionist not really speaking English (understands AM for PM and therefore your airport pickup is not there, for instance) - also loving to wash the floor and clean the rooms in the middle of night, preferably making as much noise as possible in the process, and speaking really loud, so you have no chance to sleep- sub-optimal food- particularly gloomy court for dinner and breakfast- not-so-clean bathrooms- no customer service and attention,- and the cherry on the pie: our second night, a drilling rig was operating (a large one, to dig a deep well) just 10m from our bedroom - at 8pm I called: 'will stop in 5 minutes', at 8:30 'will stop in 1 minute', at 9 I called the manager, at 9:15 I went to fetch the manager myself and drag him literally to the rig, at 9:15 I had to bring the manager again, and finally at 9:30 the rig stopped operating...the staff that said 'it will stop in xx minutes' not only did nothing, but did not even check - they just replied this to keep us 'happy' -in short, I did not believe it could get that bad, particularly at that price. STAY AWAY BY ALL MEANS!"
14,1681,"Mar 28 2005	Stay Away	The tour company I used booked me here for my first night in Delhi. I was appalled. There were mosquitos in the lobby, and the entire place looked like it was falling apart. The walls were stained, the pool had no water in it, and the bedsheets were visibly dirty. The towels were gray, there was no shower curtain (though the curtain rings were still hanging), and I felt it necessary to shower in flip-flops. The only bright spot was the inexpensive internet access that allowed me to look up alternatives for my return to Delhi later in the week."
15,1681,Feb 22 2007	Sehr schlechtes Hotel!
1,1682,Nov 18 2008 	Clean and worth considering	we booked up at the White House through Colourful Indian holidays as part of a round trip in Northern India. They chose the hotel and we looked it up and it seemed fine. It was very respectable inside. Bedrooms were air conditioned and spacious and bathrooms well equipped. Our room at the front was a wee bit noisy especially as fireworks were going off for Diwali and the stray dogs were barking but very little traffic. the area is not all that selubrious but the restaurant on the roof had quite a good selection so you did not need to venture out in the evening. One hic up we arranged to stay the night on our return and they denied knowlewdge of our booking - left us waiting wondering what was going on then asid it was 7 DEARER THAN QUOTED All seemed a little strange.So good value but I would be cautious if you book in advance - their knowledge of english is not great
2,1682,"Sep 7 2008 	Clean 	I would rate this hotel as average-good in terms of cleanliness &amp; food.Location is ok, and was good for access to Karol Bagh/Connaught Place during the day but as a lone travelling female did not feel overly safe in the evening, though think this would apply to other hotels in the capital anyway.I too booked a pre-arranged taxi from the airport which did not turn up &amp; had to haggle on my own at 02.00am so would not rely on this selling point.On my first am, going down to reception for a stroll of the local area I was told a taxi had been arranged for me to arrange a tour of the city. Altough annoyed at first that they'd arramegd my own time I went along with it &amp; would actually reccommend this if you have free time as I negotiated a reasonable price for 1.5 day tour of all the main tourist points in Dehli old &amp; new town in an a/c car and although stopped off at a cple of shops over the 2 days found this not to be an uncommon situation when getting transport in India.I would also be aware/take all booking details with you as I was charged slightly more than I booked for.However Overall I would reccommend this hotel as long as you are wary on prices/booking arrangements."
3,1682,"Mar 29 2008 	Problematic	I used this hotel to overnight between international and national flights.Website said they had Hotel pickup. I had to call to confirm and then they tried to charge me for it.The trip to national airport was double the usual cost.They said they would exchange money at 39rs/dollar..the then current rate. in the morning . I was in a time crunch and believed them. When it came time to exchange money the rate was 37rs/dollar.The rooms had peeling walls and some mold..They were clearly dishonest in their advertising and behavior. I am sure there are worse hotels in New Delhi, but for the price and the conduct of these people I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere. (I paid $70 US)"
4,1682,"Feb 9 2008 	touch above the average	Travelling from UK,we used this hotel(on the fringe of Carole Bagah mkt) twice-at the beginning and end of our india tour for one night on each occasion. The double room was quite generous and , situated to the rear of the building, not overly affected by street noise.However, since the hotel finish was predominately marble, including the floors, we did suffer from some in-house disturbance where the occupants above insisted on dragging the furniture around the floor for some reason with the resulting clangour a mite irritating. All aspects were Clean Clean Clean and this is why, after reading some reviews of what can be had in Delhi, we gave 4/5. Rooftop restaurant was quite enjoyable although slightly restricted menu-wise. The food was fresh though and the service friendly. A hotel that delivered all that we needed and we would use it again because it throws up no horrors and avoids the lottery of selecting an alternative.NB this hotel selected for us by our tour operators-&quot;COLOURFUL INDIAN HOLIDAYS aka PACKAGE TOURS INDIA -if you want the seeming contradiction of a fully superior service with huge savings while touring India, take our unreserved recommendation. Superb throughout."
5,1682,"Aug 27 2007 	Be careful	Stayed here for a week although went on a tour for 3 days.I had arranged an airport pick up direct with the hotel via email but no-one was there to meet me on arrival at the airport,so had to haggle a price with a taxi to get me to the hotel at 2.00 in the morning.On arrival at the hotel was told that there was a fault with the electricity in my room and would have to stay at another hotel round the corner,which was a hovel-the fridge constantly buzzed and when I thought of pulling the plug to shut it up-on seeing the wires(without plug)fed directly into the socket,I thought better not to.The next morning when I finally checked in to my room,my initial impressions were that it was cleaner and generally in better state of repair than the one the previous night but it left a lot to be desired.Rooms are noisy and hot water is limited.Breakfast is basic but ok.Don't change money in the hotel.You'll get a very poor rate and it is not official, ie no encashment certificate and straight out of the receptionists pocket.Karol Bagh area looks dodgy but is quite safe as long as you take basic precautions.Only really used hotel as a base to sleep as there's not much else to do.Not far to connaught place by taxi/rickshaw.For the money you could find somewhere much better."
6,1682,"Jul 17 2007 	Okay Stay But Ripped Off	We had 2 stays in this hotel in Feb 2007....2 nights when we first arrived in Delhi and one night on our return from touring Northern India.It was booked for us through a tour group we used to organise a tour of India. Location-wise, it is not bad. Its not far from the shopping district of Karol Bagh. There is an internet cafe/phone booth just down the road. There is a small shop next door to the hotel from where you can buy bottled water and snacks.Our first stay was okay. We found the rooms to be moderately clean. The rooms didn't have any windows and the air conditioner didn't work, thus the room got stuffy. The bathroom was alright, if a bit on the shabby side.Through the night, we heard the incessant beeping that is synonymous with India's roads. There was also endless barking of stray dogs. Ask for a room on the side not facing the road - it will be much quieter. Also ask for one of the end rooms - they have small windows which will help with the stuffiness issue.The food in the &quot;rooftop&quot; restaurant is nothing to write home about. I was a little hesitant eating here as it didn't look very clean. There isn't much lighting there during the night - possible to hide the stains on the tablecloths.For our return stay we had booked 3 rooms for 3 nights (we were 3 couples travelling together). But when we arrived, we were told that one of the rooms had been &quot;cancelled&quot; by us. We ended up sleeping 3 people to a room. The next day, we got our tour group to organise another hotel for us, which was closer to Connaught Place.An okay place to stay if its a short stay and you are on a budget."
7,1682,"May 13 2007 	Very bad experience	I checked in this hotel with my daughter and wife on 30th April night for 3-days. The 1st thing which was very shoking to us was the condition of the bed. The bed sheets and pillow covers were full of stain and were of lowest quality. On our complain the staff brought the new bed sheets. They were equally bad. Major drawbacks of this hotel what I have noticed are:1. Location is at a market place. Surrounding area is dirty and full of people2. Hotel rooms are stuffy3. Hotel itself is cramped. No space even for taking a stroll leisurely4. Breakfast is not at all worth for money5. Staffs are not friendly. If you are not careful cheating will be the inevitable experience in this hotelMy good advise to any fellow traveler, especially foreighners, to avoid this hotel entirely."
8,1682,"Nov 10 2006 	Rip off artists	We booked directly with the hotel in September 2006 for a one night stay in October and a three night stay in November. As we were staying four nights, we were offered two free pick ups from the airport. We provided our credit card details as security.When we arrived at the hotel in October, we were asked to pay for the pickup. The bills was different to the agreed rate - the receptionist tried to charge us more - fortunately we had copies of our correspondence with us. We asked for two club rooms and were given standard rooms and charged club prices. We were given very noisy rooms overlooking the street.Despite this, we confirmed our bookings before we left for November as we did not at that date, want to go to the trouble of finding another hotel.The day we were due to check in, we called the hotel to confirm our pickup form the airport. We were told that our reservations had been cancelled as we had not provided confirmation - I don't see how this can be as we confirmed in person and wathced the receptionist write down our requirements in their reservations book. We were left in a lurch as there were virtually no hotel rooms left that night in Delhi due to a medical conference. Do not book with the White House - the reservation policy cannot be relied upon at all and they do not appear to honour their own pricing policy for their rooms."

1,1686,"weekend holidya	Good property, reccomend stay"
2,1686,"capital dreams	Warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Nice service for the value paid."
3,1686,Nov 17 2009 	Excellent service-would stay there again	Whilst the hotel is very plush and elegant it still had that comfy feeling. We were made very welcome and nothing was too much trouble
4,1686,Nov 8 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	Great place to stay in Delhi. The hotel is designed with class and ambience. Had meals in quite a few of the restaurants and all of them were superb. Even tried the Bill Clinton meal in one! It's pretty big and can keep 3 people happily fed!
5,1686,"Nov 3 2009 	banging all night	Having just got back from delhi and staying in different hotels in delhi { imperial,bristol and raddison} we decided to have a night at the ITC maurya new delhi. the room was so cramp it was the worst room out of all the others we stayed in. there must be better rooms for hotel like this one, some work started in the early hours in our next room and there was banging all night we didnt sleep a wink, tried to phone to reception got no answer and it cost nearly double than all the other hotels. the dublin bar was ok thats all. never again will i stay there staff was ok but didnt offer us a apology, it was the last night of our holiday and the worst.while we was thererecommended to stay looking back on the holiday i cant understand why i didnt complain"
6,1686,"Oct 12 2009 	ITC - ND	One of the nicest hotels. Excellent partys, lots of young people, the only place u can eat good food 24/7"
7,1686,"Sep 14 2009 	Nice Digs in New Delhi	After traveling for 7 weeks around the world my babysitter and children voted this their favorite hotel. We stayed in tower suites and I am not sure how those rooms compare to other rooms in the hotel. We had two rooms and they were identical. The mosaic shower, large bathtub, nice sized room and attentive service were mentioned as favorites. Everyone loved the coffee, tea and hot chocolate that was served before bedtime and as part of the wake up call. The large outside pool was perfect for an afternoon reprieve from the August Indian heat.The executive floor was nice but not nearly as spectacular from food availability as other executive floors around the world. The nightly offerings for snacks could have been better, but the atmosphere was sophiticated and stylish. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs had plenty of tasty offerings and the staff made sure that if anyone wanted or needed anything their desires were satisfied. The hotel security appears to be high because of other events in the country. It is impossible to get into the hotel without having your car checked and luggage x-rayed and body searched. One never knows how safe you can be if someone wants to do something, but it appears that the property takes security matters seriously.The only downside to the hotel is the large number of AA and Finnair flight crews do monopolize the business center computers periodically during the day. In the future I plan on staying at the ITC Maurya in New Delhi."
8,1686,"Sep 13 2009 	Unbeatable Service 	My father and I stayed here together last month. We always stay at the Maurya when in Delhi. We'd asked for a room with twin beds and when we arrived and saw the room, it felt a little cramped. When we asked the guest service manager if he could do something about it, he immediately upgraded us to a wonderful deluxe room, which felt big enough to be a suite. The only issue was that it only had a double bed, but with separate duvets, it wasn't a problem. I ate several meals at the hotel. The Bukhara is an old tradition of mine and yes, while it may be sometimes erratic in quality, I still love it. My standard order is the leg of lamb, daal and naan. I still love the place. The coffee shop has an excellent spread for breakfast, can't complain about anything there. They have all the usual congees, bacon and eggs as well as the indian specialities, which I love to eat when in India. The lunch buffet, the day I ate there, was during a Keralan special day and they had a lot of South Indian specialities. In order to save time, I just asked the waiter to bring all six dishes to my table, which they kindly did. My Humble House - their Chinese restaurant, was just OK by my opinion. We had dinner there and I've had better. But I generally don't like Indian Chinese restaurants. West View - now this is an interesting place. You go thorough a whole slew of dishes from sea food to meat. Again, while the quality is good, I generally prefer local food while in Delhi. Golf Bar - regular bar with a golfing theme. Had Lembu Paani, fresh lime with sugar and salt, delicious.Dublin - Excellent bar. This hotel had a complimentary happy hour from 6 to 8 pm!! Seriously! Ok the whiskey is red label rather than black, but if you have the vodka they'll serve the Smirnoff, which will suffice. Four vodka martinis and dinner is so much better! My only negatives: a) the internet in the room's pretty expensive, yes it is free in the business centre, but I want to use it in the room. b) in an amazingly perfect room, there was a power outlet that must have been recently installed and it was shockingly not level. Normally I wouldn't notice it, but everything else in the room was perfect. c) The bathroom was fully stocked with excellent toiletries, but replenishment wasn't uniform. All items were not replenished daily."
9,1686,"Sep 2 2009 	ok but overpriced	i stayed at this hotel, booked from the internet, all though december is high season .The rooms are large and comes with all mod cons of five star hotel. my check in was quick as being a gold member of starwood hotels. staff were lot friendly and always knew my name .internet was free and so was breakfast come with room rates. I also had dinner at hotel which was lot expensive than other hotels i have stayed in asia. apart from that, hotel was very nice place to stay.To hotel restu Bukhara please the food is great but price is not its not paris its delhi ,please review your prices ."
10,1686,"Aug 31 2009 	friends night out	I went to this hotel this august on my b'day.It was a impulsive decision and we just dropped in. This hotel is extremely well placed in terms of connectivityThe most famous resutrant in this hotel is bukhara and dal bhukara is the delicacy ( takes around 12 hrs to make it)lavishly decorated main gallery slips into a host of luxary shopping storesThe other side is the resturants and a beautiful swimming pool( which i feel is not good enuf to swim but to just lie and soother your nerves)I've been in this place a lot of time and spent countless nights in it's lobbyI frankly like the crowd here although people who come here are a little old but it's not one of those hotels which are painfully silent.a date, or a b'day party or a romantic getaway is what i'd recommend this one for"
11,1686,"Aug 19 2009 	Excellent Hotel with Excellent Food.	Hotel rooms are very well decorated, very clean and trendy. Food at the main restaurant was really outstanding. The Staff was great with little delays for the check out. The area is not the best of the city and also the Back view was really bad. The hotel is an excellent place to stay in DELHI."
12,1686,"Aug 11 2009 	Definitely 5*	As far as I can see every 5* hotel in India is amazing. This hotel was more so as it literally had everything you could ever need. ( if they didnt have something that you wanted, they would get it for you ). Food and bars very good and very entertaining. Well worth a visit."
13,1686,"Aug 3 2009 	Space for improvements	Just returned from my jurney in India. I had two seperate stays at Maurya and my general impression is that there is some space for improvements left. It might be that some thinks changed due to recession but failures which shouldn't happened includes:-wake up call automated service didn't work properly, that's why afterthat I requested personal wake up call which was either late for 15 minutes and provided again with automated service. From that point I missed an important meeting that day.-Housekeeping department should be focused on small things, placed in room, not to be missed. There should't be discrepance on ameneties in separete rooms.-They advertise Executive lounge but one is not in funcion. Having drinks in basement in Dublin at 6PM is realy not an unforgatable experience, although Dublin itself is nice. As I am Platinum I was offered having drinks in Tower lounge, but again very limited service.-Temperature at Delhi is too hot to spend a couple of hours near the pool, but having service available in order to buy yourself some drinks would be a nice gasture.-Confirmed Pick up service at railway station failed, concierge told me that they sent a car, but we will never know if we really missed each other or not.I personally expected (based on experience of other collegues) upgrade to ITC One based on my status - but this is completelly my fault. But after changing the room where I was woken up due to mainanace (which is a good part as wake up call didn't work again) It would be unwritten rule to treat a guest at least with a fruit platter or bottle of wine in order to say that you are sorry. If not upgrading at that time.Generaly don't get impression that this is the worst property, but as I said there is a room for improvement. Personally I will pick up another location next time."
14,1686,"Jul 28 2009 	Top Delhi Hotel	Located very close to the International Airport, this 5 star hotel is located in the green diplomatic enclave. However there is still some distance to go to the centre of the city and all the sights.The service and the rooms are of excellent quality and certainly as expected fo any 5 star hotel in the world. Staff do try and do as much as they can to help and are prompt in their service. The rooms are very clean, modern, well featured and above all very comfortable. The hotel has most features you would expect like a swimming pool and spa and has numerous top notch restaurants.The only drawback could be that the hotel is expensive given the local cost of living. However you can't go wrong by staying here."
15,1686,"Jul 25 2009 	Good facilities but disappointing service	Stayed here for 5 nights in July for business.First the positives:+ Nice location in a quite part of the town (Diplomatic Enclave)+ Large, clean rooms with good amenities ... Molton Brown bath products a nice touch of luxury+ Great restaurant selection and food, although expensive (especially the alcohol)+ Very nice spa ... one of the best massages that I've had in a long timeNow, the reasons why I would NOT recommend this hotel:- Front desk ... non-smoking room that I reserved was &quot;given away&quot; to another guest. Guy at check-in took 15 minutes to figure out what to do with me, and I could hear him telling the manager that my rate didn't quality for a better room ... not very professional- Restaurant ... breakfast can be extremely busy and the staff does not deal with the chaos well. My colleague and I on separate occasions had our tables given away to another guest while we got up to get some coffee- Room service ... messed up my order and took forever to resolve. And on top of that, the food wasn't very good"
16,1686,"Jul 15 2009 	Love the Maurya Sheraton	I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton in September, 1984. Your quiz doesn't go back that far. I LOVED it! It was beautiful and one could really experience Indian culture. I had excellent service . I took a cab in every day to be with friends in Vijay Nagar. I went on a tour of Delhi, New Delhi and Agra and saw the Taj Mahal.The whole trip was an exotic paradise. I hope I get the opportunity to stay there again.Rene T. Armstead(Beachwood, Ohio)"
17,1686,"Jun 21 2009 	Grand Palace !	What a grand welcome this great hotel offers! This was the same hotel Bill Clinton chose to stay during his visit to India.No doubt I too was completely overwhelmed by the grandiosity of this place.This is surrounded by one of the greenest places in Delhi.Located in the heart of Diplomatic enclave this hotel in very convenient for meetings with politicians.I stayed here overnight for our business meeting in an executive suite in New Tower .Food was great as usual, delicious, vibrant display and great variety.The bathroom utility products are also of very good qualityThe price is surprisingly low as compared to other well known business hotels in Delhi.You can book your stay thru website which offers great prices.In all a magnificient place to stay.It's a landmark hotel to witness the richness of Indian heritage."
18,1686,"Jun 18 2009 	ITC Maurya New Delhi	Only had the pleasure of staying here for one night, but as with all the ITC hotels I have stayed in, everyone was friendly and helpful..The rooms were spacious and very clean.We ate in the hotel that evening and had a selection of sushi, which was lovely, we were celebrating a birthday that evening and they made the evening extra special.The hotel is a little way from the the sights - short cab ride its well worth to sometimes escape and be in a relaxing environment.."
19,1686,"Jun 15 2009	Excellent property the best indian food	very well located, great property, looks old from outside but well appointed inside. the best is the indian food restaurant- bukhara. overall food is exceptional in the hotel."
20,1686,"Jun 13 2009 	Luxury hotel in Delhi suits business and leisure travellers	Stayed at Maurya hotel for 2 days. On my arrival day, I had some time over and could enjoy the pool. Very good service and friendly staff. On one night, I needed cash for the day after and reception send their car to take me to nearest ATM. As a single woman traveller, the transfer to airport was complementery. I had a room on Star Guest Prefered Floor -Room 1505. Very interesting painting in the main lobby. One thing though which I found strange : when I needed a car for a day, I didn't receive an official price list for car renting....instead the answer was a little bit confused and unclear. The stay was very good overall. But be ready that restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive. I had Lunch Buffet, it was really good, costs 2000INR."
21,1686,"Jun 13 2009 	Magnificent Maurya	I had stayed in Maurya, as part of my business visit to Delhi. My overall experience was just amazing..1. The room's warm colors give you a sense of peace and comfort, especially at the end of an arduous day2. Each room has its own mini-bar - stocked with the best alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks3.The swimming pool was large and very well maintained4. There was rich variety in food - plenty to choose from (Buffet at coffee shop, Bukhara, Drinks at the club etc) 5. Prompt room service6. Very helpful staff - (for instance, they never showed me directions but actually led me to the place)Truly delightful experience overall - would love to return.."
22,1686,Jun 11 2009 	Best hotel for dining out in North India	The Maurya has the best selection of North Indian food. The hospitality is great - you are in a special world right from the time that the doorman greets you. I love the lobby - one can conduct a full-fledged business meeting right there. The rooms are lovely and the offers like the trip to the Taj Mahal are really well thought-through. I also like the shopping arena in the hotel which is open at unearthly hours for the last-minute shopper. The attention to detail in the restaurants is wonderful - it is easy to make friends among the lovely staff.
23,1686,Jun 10 2009 	Expected More	Stayed for a night and honestly was left a tad bit disappointed. It was alright. The food in the chinese was exp and ok. The room was big but didn't care much for it. Wouldn't return
24,1686,"Jun 10 2009 	Great Hospitality	Just two points to make, great hospitality and good food at bukara."
25,1686,Jun 8 2009 	Good HotelGreat Location	One of good hotels in New-Delhi.Excellent Location.Nearby to India Gate.Located near to all Embassies.
26,1686,"Jun 7 2009 	All you can ask for in a Starwood Hotel only 15 mins from airport	The ITC Maurya has all the facilities (gym, pool, spa) that you will need to feel comfortable. Rooms were very clean with excellent attention to detail. Business center offered free internet use. Internet in rooms was expensive but inline with other 5-star western hotels. Food in hotel is excellent. The restaurants here are well known and local wealthy Indians dine and party here. Bars are supposedly well known but I didn't go to any of them. Pool is nice and you can swim laps. Gym is excellent and the spa looks great as well.The only problem I had was that some of the staff weren't as friendly and helpful to my wife and I because we were not business folks, but travellers dressed in casual clothes and sandals. The travel desk wasn't particularly helpful when we needed to get a train and they told us that they'd call the bus station for a bus schedule but they never did.The only other thing I was annoyed of is that the hotel taxis will try to tout you. They don't like to make one way trips so they will try to tout you and ask you if they can stay and wait for you at your destination. Often times, it's just cheaper to walk onto the street and grab and auto rickshaw."
27,1686,Jun 5 2009	awesome experience	its a great hote. great rooms. Awesome service. Good food. overall a great experience
28,1686,"Jun 4 2009 	Great Hotel with a Class of its own	Its a very good hotel to stay with I liked it as its half way from Airport and the CP. The hotel has a class of its own with very modern looks of rooms, the staff is very prompt, the service is very good and every minute details is taken care off when you stay with them. Has very good choice of food with very good Indian style restaurant. In general its a worth stay I had, good rooms, prompt service, very good food and a great place all equipped to have a business deal"
29,1686,Jun 4 2009 	Fantastic Stay	I am frequent traveler to Delhi and had the opportunity to stay at this iconic hotel. The rooms are fantastic. the re-done bathrooms with clean lines are nice. the modern looks make it truly on par with any other 5 star hotel room across the world.The food is expensive ( no surprises there huh ?) but they do have good room service and I was also offered free breakfast for some strange reason. :-)
30,1686,"Jun 3 2009 	Loved the Oriental Food- Humble House	Clearly, this is one of the most happening hotels in India, Speedy, efficient service. Great location in the Diplomatic Enclave. Terrific food and theme restaurants. A great coffee shop."
31,1686,Jun 3 2009 	Loved the Ambience	The hotel ambience is fantastic. The room was good and I really enjoyed the spread of the breakfast buffett. It was an overnight stay for me and I really liked everything about the hospitality which the hotel provided.
32,1686,"Jun 3 2009 	Not that good	The experience at Maurya was bad to say the least.It looked like a cheap hotel which hasn't been maintained for ages. The food was pretty good but overall the place was bad.The cleanliness was not upto the mark.On the positives, apart from the food, the location was good. It is an ideal place in Delhi.To the readers, my views may look a bit biased but overall it was not a great place to stay."
33,1686,Jun 3 2009 	Passion for comfort	Hotel Mourya is crown of historic city of Delhi.During business stay they provide all luxury and comforts which really miss in other place.Good food and warmth service are the tool which fetch you again and again in Hotel Mouya
34,1686,Jun 2 2009 	the best hospitality	one of the best hotels in Delhi with positive vibes and always look lively. The BEST HOSPITALITY never found any where else in the world.
35,1686,Jun 2 2009 	Excellent Service	The best part of my stay at ITC was that they never let me feel that i was away from my home and looked after my comfort
36,1686,"May 19 2009 	Loved 'My Humble House'	Maurya, in many respects, is ahead of the times. It hosts one of India's first discotheques. Service is speedy, efficient &amp; courteous. Food at all the restaurants is great.- My Humble House is extremely quaint and dainty. Terrific coffee at the bar. Great location."
37,1686,"May 18 2009 	Excellent hotel - would go back again and again	Having stayed in many of Delhi's five star hotels, I thought I would try the Maurya as I got a very good rate. I was not disappointed, especially as I was upgraded to the Towers (the club wing). The room admittedly was not as big as for example the Oberoi, but big enough and very modern. Best feature was the rain shower in the bathroom, beautifully tiled. The Towers has its own breakfast room, which was quiet and lovely, with waiter service and classical music. The Chinese restaurant and 24-hour restaurant were also excellent. The two Indian restaurants are great but really over-priced and a bit pretentious. The gym/spa has recently been re-done and is gorgeous; however the spa rates are astronomical so I didn't go for any treatments. Hotel staff were always professional and helpful, without being obseqious and hungry for tips as they are in some Delhi hotels. All in all, I would definitely come back to the Maurya. My only real complaint is the location, which is a little bit out of the way - but only a little bit."
38,1686,"May 11 2009 	Fantastic property	One of the best properties have stayed in - food, room service, location, ambience etc."
39,1686,"May 11 2009 	Hospitality at it best	Having stayed in couple of excellent hotels in &amp; out of India, at first i did not expect any thing different from Maurya when i did my first booking for a business trip to Delhi.But as soon as you enter the huge central Pavilion from front porch (where reception desk is located) , you can't stop looking at bright lighting ,lots of brass &amp; Gold finish elevator doors.Once inside your room, your dream walk to luxury continues with sparking clean interiors, 32 inches LCD TV, cozy bed &amp; variety of fruits &amp; snacks available at your disposable.To cut it short, if you haven't stayed at Maurya still, you have been missing true luxury at it best !!!!!"
40,1686,"May 10 2009 	Pretty OK	Hotel, stay, food, business facility was good. But the neighbourhood is bad"
41,1686,"May 10 2009 	Royal Treatment	Excellent , Superb. Everything was at its best"
42,1686,May 4 2009 	A Conference with delicious food	It was offical conference organised by my organisation which included introduction to PDMS etc. It was a full day conference with deligates from wide variety of industries. I had a very delicious indian food. Overall Wonderful day's stay at sheraton.
43,1686,"May 3 2009 	All about Bukhara and Dum Pukth	The hotel was classy and the service was excellent. the highlight, of course, was the food at Bukhara and Dum Pukth. Seems like ITC Maurya is 'the' hangout of celebrities and VVIPs in New Delhi. The only disappointed was an extra bed that we had asked for, which collapsed in the middle of the night while we were sleeping."
44,1686,"May 3 2009 	Business Travel - Stay at Sheraton Murya	I like Starwood properties around the world so I decided to stay at the Sheraton Murya Hotel in New Delhi.As a Platinum member of the Starwood Preferred Guest programme, I was upgraded to a suite room which was very spacious and had all the amenities.Check-in is always in the same style as other Starwood properties where staff greet their guests with warmth and in style that reflects all Starwood Hotels. I selected my usual 500 Starpoints welcome amenity which helps build up my points for future redemptions.One thing that I love about this hotel is its fine Indian dining at the Bukhara Restaurant. It is probably the best Indian food I have ever eaten and it is high recommended. Try the kebabs and all the tandoori dishes. You will be so full at the end that you will not feel like eating for a few days.In India, the food spread is so large that there is never an end to eating. I love the food there and if you are foodie like I am, you will surely enjoy this hotel.All in all, I highly recommended hotel for business travellers and not to mention for the foodie."
45,1686,May 2 2009 	An evening at Bukhara	Bukhara is a world known restaurant for its aromatic and delicious food.
46,1686,"May 2 2009 	Business Hang out	My husband has stayed at the Maurya Sheraton more than 25 times and I have accompanied him a few. the architecture, Interiors and Rooms are beautifully designed. The Hotel is meant for the creme de la creme, but the beautiful mural dome in the lobby witnesses hundreds of business meetings,people who just come here to have a meeting and then move on! The beauty salon is good as is the famous restaurant 'Bukhara,' with its Daal Bukhara. Breakfast at he Coffee shop is OK. What is good, is that complaints are dealt with efficiently, but at this price, they better be!"
47,1686,"May 2 2009 	Wish I could give it more than 5 Stars......	This is the first time I am staying at the Maurya &amp; I am overwhelmed. Firstly &amp; most importantly by their service. If the hallmark of a fine hotel is to make you feel welcome and at a home away from home the Maurya Sheraton excels in fulfilling this perquisite by a mile.Every member of the staff is helpful, kind, compassionate &amp; cheerful. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome &amp; comfortable. I just requested housekeeping for a firmer mattress for my back problem &amp; the A. Manager of Housekeeping Mr. Kishore Kumar personally landed up to make sure that I was satisfied &amp; comfortable with the arrangements.The rooms are large spacious and well done up. They are certainly better than the ones in the Taj Mansingh &amp; the Oberois. The spa is fantastic &amp; so is the swimming pool.Last but not the least is the amazing food that one can savor in the Maurya. The Dum Pukht &amp; Bukhara are easily two of the finest restaurants for Indian cuisine in Delhi. Even the in room dining at the Maurya is one the finest I have ever experienced.The warm service, fine dining &amp; comfortable accommodation are only some of the reasons why I would love to give the Maurya Sheraton more than 5 stars &amp; strongly recommend it to my fellow travelers on Trip Advisor."
48,1686,May 2 2009 	Loved the Restaurant Bukara	An awesome Mughal Experience... This is what I call Dining in Style... The food tastes so delicious here at this restaurant that people should be careful not to eat their own fingers!!
49,1686,"May 1 2009	Excellent location - excellent service	spent 3 nights there while on a wedding ceremony in Delhi &amp; Kathmandu. Staff is professional and very keen to help you. Many nice details, i.e. room staff can see from outside if room is occupied, there is european plug on the desk, no need for adapters! food is excellent, though we only had breakfast from the huge buffet and one dinner - all other nighs we were out of the hotel.Only criticism: Lobby is too cold and so is the restaurant. If you sit close to an AC outlet you have to wear winter clothes."
50,1686,"Apr 30 2009 	Loved the ambience	I just have three words to say for this hotel.. Excellent, Fabulous and Magnificent.. Amazing food in Bukhara restaurant. I just love its speciality - Dal Bukhara. Very good brand shops are also available in the hotel for shopping. It is one of the poshest restaurant of New Delhi. Most of the foreign country ministries stays there during their visit to India. Hotel is landmark of luxury. And honestly speaking, one cannot raise a finger against their service. Its ambience has copious alluring content. I am also fully gratified by their serivce."
51,1686,"Apr 26 2009 	Outstanding and Palatial	I have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past several months and its service and quality of rooms seems to impress me more on each visit.The attention to detail in each room is perfect. Nothing is there that does not work, and everything you need is in place from the get go - including the simplest need of an iron and board.The room rate may be high, the restaurants on the expensive side, but the hotel does not overcharge for items such as the internet or the laundry (compared to other 5+ star hotels around the world).The service is impeccable and totally reliable - pleasant and courteous staff go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one."
52,1686,Apr 23 2009	Loved It	It is one of the most comforting hotes with nice rooms and excellent food. It always nice to come and visit the hotel
53,1686,"Apr 23 2009 	Excellent Dining Options	On check-in they directed me to a club room which was stinking of cigar smoke. On complaining they shifted me to a non-smoking room, but it was not a club room. I didn't argue with the front desk as the room was comfortable enough. The whole check-in process delayed my schedule by nearly an hour. The room was well-equipped with all amenites. The restaurants in this hotel are excellent. Ate one night at My Humble House, which is part of the Tung Lok Group, which have many award winning restaraunts in Singapore and Taipei. Great ambience and superb food, but frightfully expensive. A more reasonable option is the West View Grill which had an impressive Grill Buffet, with excellent variety of seafood and meats, besides a decent salad bar. I would probably stay here again purely for the dining options, as this hotel also houses the famed Bukhara and Dum Pukt restaraunts, the best known Indian restaraunts in India."
54,1686,"Apr 22 2009	Great weddin	I had gone to maurya to attend a family function. I must say its d best hotel Ive visisted so far. The ambience was awesome, the food sumptuous..the decor was great.. services were prompt..A very nice experience indeed..I loved the cold coffe with ice cream there :)"
55,1686,"Apr 20 2009 	Bukhara is the best!	The hotel needs no introduction as it has hosted some of the most world famous dignitarties including Bill Clinton. The massage chair, the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, the music system are my favourites and hence I enjoyed staying here several times in the last 5 years.I would recommend the ITC One rooms as they are an experience in themselves.I also enjoyed the food at Bukhara and entertaining a few clients there for business has provded helpful.The staff, one of the best!You can also enjoy the world class piano by Brian Sylas here. He is too good on the piano and his fingers seems to have some magic."
56,1686,"Apr 20 2009 	Excellent- The Maurya	Excellent personalised services. Food is of the highest qualtiy. Excellent restaurants- The Bhukara is the best in India. Good loyalty program, the Welcomaward. Happy hours, at the Towers lounge is worth mentioning as excellent."
57,1686,"Apr 19 2009 	At ITC Maurya	For the business traveler to Delhi, it is the perfect hotel. Conveniently located, good facilities, nice food. The hotel upgraded me - I was glad. The upgraded room was wonderful. I particularly liked the massage chair in the room and the music system - enjoyed listening to Delhi FM channels in the morning while getting ready :-)The size of the property is something that you cannot miss - and that too in the middle of the city.I like the hotel's relative closeness to the airport.Would certainly recommend this for your next Delhi visit."
58,1686,Apr 17 2009 	Great Food	This is one hotel property i love to go to time and again. Also a great place to go to with friends or business guests for the food at Buhkara. Recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the great food at Mauyra.
59,1686,"Apr 17 2009 	Luxury hotel famous for its food	The Maurya is a grand hotel. I have stayed there a number of times in different room types. In all cases I found the rooms to be very well outfitted, spacious and ideal for the business traveler or the tourist. The charges are steep in comparison to other hotels however you can see why once you have stayed there. The service is very good and they are eager to take care of your every request. The highlight of the Maurya are its two restaurants The Bukhara and Dum Pukht. Both serve different but unique kinds of Indian cuisine however beware the food is not easily digested by those that have not earned it. A good workout before or after a meal at one of these places is recommended. The Hotel is located near the posh diplomatic area of New Delhi and hence is in relatively verdant and peaceful surroundings."
60,1686,"Apr 16 2009 	Loved the ambience	It was a wonderful experience &amp; started the moment the check-in formalities started. The front office staff were extremely courtious &amp; their 'namaste' welcome with their smiles takes out all your stress.The room was very well - just right temperature &amp; right lux for the retiring eyes after a stressful day. More importantly the Indianness in the ambience all around, shows the great heritage of India."
61,1686,"Apr 14 2009 	Excellent rooms	All five star hotels in India are majestic and oversized - this is no exception. Great rooms in the main area - Platinum members, I would not take the upgrade to the ITC tower, rather ask for it in the main tower; newer and larger rooms. Only drawback is constant problems with internet access.Bhukara and Dhum Pukt are v. expensive but excellent restaurants. Bfast is average."
62,1686,"Jan 24 2009 	A busy hotel!	I love returning to Delhi and always find it a challenge to find a suitable hotel, with good value and location. On a business trip in end Sep-Oct 2008, I had to stay in The Murya for multiple reasons. One thing during my entire stay remained a constant and that was the matchless South-Asian hospitality that began with the chauffer-drive from Delhi airport (DEL) and then on to a warm traditional welcome in the hotel lobby, check-in and right thru to the check out that included a goodbye present and a voucher to use the ITC lounge at DEL. . Not to miss out on the excellent service provided by the concierge, breakfast buffet &amp; beauty salon staff! Apart from some general information issues when approaching staff (maybe because a lot interns are probably working on some shifts) my stay remained hassle-free. Upon first impressions one is quite impressed by the dominating and eye-catching mural painted by renowned Krishen Khanna on the domed-ceiling of the lobby. However the rest of the interiors are a bit dated except from a few upgraded floors. I stayed in an Executive Floor room which I assume was their entry level room. Had no issues with it except that it was a bit on smallish side for a weeks stay. Comfort as promised by Starwood properties with a choice of pillows that boggles your senses. Good room service and great breakfast. Although I find the two restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht over priced and overrated. Although the food is great! And how can I forget the Sticky Date pudding with butter scotch sauce at the Dublin Bar. Interestingly enough when I had a mid-night raving for the same, the room service staff made sure that although it was not available on the room service menu in the early morning hours arrange it for me...now that is service!I had a smooth one-week long stay with a truly amazing culinary experience including a breakfast to look forward to and a very friendly beauty salon. In fact I shopped from the little arcade- something I avoid doing at large hotels but I could simply not resist.The only down-side if on a holiday is the crowded lobby as some airline crew stay there and the hotel also hosts many conferences, seminars as well as receives dignities from around the world. Otherwise contrary to some reviews that consider it over-rated to be in the Luxury Collection of Starwood properties, it is a good hotel mainly because of its level of service."
63,1686,"Jan 8 2009 	A good stay for the business traveler	Stayed here one night for business in the Towers section of the hotel. Room was nice with all the amenities. Tried to book a round of golf in the few hours we had through the concierge and were told that one course was booked and the other was closed. Enjoyed the Dublin Bar happy hour with co-workers from 6-8 PM. They kept on serving free onion rings, chicken fingers and nuts. Also, my co-workers and myself were not charged for any of the drinks. Never got the final word on that, but did happy hour mean free drinks from 6-8PM? Lastly, had dinner at Bukhara and have to say it was well worth it. Everyone will tell you this is where the Clinton's ate when they visited the hotel and if I remember correclty they even have some type of &quot;Clinton&quot; special. I would reccomend reservations because my group had to wait about 30 minutes on a weeknight at around 8:00 PM (after happy hour of course). My biggest complaint was the gym, if you want to call it that. They must have been renovating because it was a handful of cardio machines and a tiny amount of dumbells crammed into what looked like a renovated hotel room."
64,1686,"Nov 9 2008 	Great Hotel in Delhi	Somewhat expensive but excellent stay in this hotel. Spacious rooms, great amenities."
65,1686,"Nov 3 2008 	Good but not too great	The rooms at this hotel were great. I only had trouble with check-in and service in general. I had booked 2 rooms but when I arrived at the hotel, only 1 of them was ready. We had to wait for about an hour before the other room was ready. Most of the staff were literally salivating for tips. They all greet you hypocritically hoping that you'll drop a tip in their direction.I think it would be better to stay at the Sheraton in Saket which is cheaper as well as newer."
66,1686,"Sep 21 2008 	great place	wonderful hotel. stayed in a towers room which was a little small but the quality of the room and elec toys made up for it. massive flat screen tv. great hotel overall, good choice of restaurants, make sure you visit the Bukhara Restaurant, amazing food. Overall kind of expensive place to stay but most 5 * in Delhi are"
67,1686,"Aug 15 2008 	v-e-r-y disappointed.	What I hate more than anything is looking at photos on a travel site and on arrival the room looks NOTHING like that.I was excited to stay at the &quot;best hotel in Delhi&quot;, I had three nights booked.Things didn't start well on my arrival to the Maurya, the hotel had some visiting dignitary and made your arrival seem like it was an inconvenience. Plus, having a pat down and your bags x-rayed and searched as you entered the hotel wasn't comforting.........yes, I'm whining, but I don't do it often, so please forgive me.After requesting a &quot;non-smoking room&quot;, I was put in a smoking room, I returned back down to the reception and after a long wait and a death stare, finally I was put in a non-smoking room.Other negatives:The gym was under construction, so a small room was made into a temporary gym room. Don't bother putting your do not disturb sign on your door, coz it was ignored on m-a-n-y occasions. Aghhhhh!Careful about the charges for a hotel taxi, and if you order your own through reception, ask for an AC car, otherwise they will automatically order a non-AC at the same cost.Some positives:The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the staff happy and helpful.The spa, the head massage was excellent!Bukhara restaurant, simply awesome.The pool yummy.This was my forth visit to India, my last to the Maurya.Sorry to be so negative.Penny"
68,1686,"Jul 31 2008 	Amazing luxury	Hotel looks spectacular and seems to be a favourite of Delhi's rich and famous. I had a room in The Towers which I loved: large, with very tasteful decoration, a wonderful bed and a massage chair. Staff very friendly and efficient. Bukhara is a top-rated restaurant which you have to experience: tandoori eaten without cutlery. Afterwards I can recommended the laundry service that makes your shirt look better than new! My only complaint was a disputed bill from the taxi service: make sure they details their charges to you beforehand."
69,1686,Jul 27 2008 	Solid performance	Stayed at the Executive Level in a newly renovated room. Good size room with stable internet connection. Nice bathroom with a glass separation to the bedroom.Very nice touch by room assistant who added personal touch to housekeeping.Breakfast buffet (incl. in rate) offers good choice in Western and Indian food. One point I like about this hotel is that I do not have to hail a taxi and travel around to have my favorite meal downstairs at Bukhara.
70,1686,"Jun 15 2008 	the preferred residence of visiting heads of state and global business leaders	I had previous experience of this hotel, each marred by something really irritating and/or stupid (from trying to get toiletries delivered to the room, to discrimination in the bar). I have also stayed in most classes of rooms, from basic through to ITC One, and used all bars and restaurants at one time or another. So this wasn't a stab in the dark.My gmail account was blocked by the archimedian internet; some of our reservations were invisible at check-in (of course they were very clear at check-out!); food hygiene is not a priority here (giving support to my theory that it's the 'clean' places that do for you in India); though there often seems more staff than guests, getting staff to do anything is often impossible due to demarcation.As this is (the preferred residence of visiting heads of state and global business leaders for over 25 years&quot;, it should be better. It probably is for that class of guest. But the hotel demonstrates little interest in others. The Maurya management should look to The Sonar (Kolkata) for guidance...On a positive note, the Towers Club staff are great, as are the Poolside staff; the renovated rooms are a great improvement, especially as the windows now fit..."
71,1686,"Jun 6 2008 	Good hotel but take out a mortgage if you use the Dublin bar.	I stayed at the ITC Maurya a couple of times in May '08.The welcome was very good, as was the check in. The room was small but otherwise was very good indeed with a superb bathroom and walk in &quot;wetroom&quot; type shower. Being somewhat of a 'gadget nut', I was impressed by the amount of thought which must have gone into equipping, furnishing and decorating the rooms. The remote control for all the lights was a nice touch, as was the plasma tv. There is a separate floor which is exclusively for single female guests so they can feel more secure in their rooms.Breakfasts could be taken in a number of different locations in the hotel and all were excellent.The public areas in the hotel were in many cases, sumptuous. There is a very nice outdoor pool, a superbly equipped business lounge and an up-market shopping mall in the hotel itself.The only bad thing was the cost of eating and drinking at the hotel. The 'Dublin bar' was the obvious choice but even during 'happy hour' where drinks were half price, they were still eye-bulgingly expensive. After 8PM, you needed a second mortgage to be able to pay the bill!The other slight problem is that the hotel is not an easy walk from any other shops or restaurants although we did eat away from the hotel wherever possible.On stepping out from the hotel, I was invariably pestered by taxi drivers and 'tuc tuc' (motorised rickshaw) drivers. They did not seem to understand the concept of going for a walk and were typically agressive and pestering with their touting.All in all a superb hotel although expensive by any country's standards."
72,1686,"May 16 2008 	Expensive hotel but it was GREAT!!!	Stayed for 1 night in the hotel for a recent business trip. As it was a last minute booking, I have no choice but to book directly from the hotel and was booked in a deluxe suite paying a hefty USD630 per night. Definitely the most expensive hotel I have stayed in!!!!! Then again hotels in India are never cheap which is a sharp contrast to the poverty scattered in the city.......very ironical indeedArrived late in the evening and did not really get to enjoy the hotel as I have to check out at 6:00 am the next morning without having to enjoy the breakfast. Check in was prompt and upon entering the room, was impressed with the size and the great comfort the room offers. There is a living room which is separated from the bedroom, the bathroom was spacious with the cabinet located in the bathroom. There are 2 LCDs TVs in the room which is a thoughtful gesture and was equipped with a good working table which is important for business traveller. Internet access was expensive though compared to other ASEAN hotels. The bed was comfortable and the nice gesture of having scented oil to soothe you for a relaxing rest in definitely well thought of. While I did not get to enjoy the breakfast,had dinner at the cafe with my agent and this buffet dinner is very expensive at more than USD60 per person. The spread is not very extensive compared tp what I see in Singapore and definitely not worth the price. Perhaps it was a Saturday, the dinner was more expensive. As we were lazy to venture out of the hotel for dinner and guess buffet is the only choice as we are undecided on what to have.....All I would say is that it's a wrong choice and would have tried other restaurants in the hotel given that there are many other options. The other negative feedback I had about the hotel was its extremely slow checkout and poor service rendered by the staff who has checked me extra for the amount which I have already paid in cash. If not because I was observant, I would have been charged twice. Furthermore, with the rates for deluxe suite, was told it would come with complimentary airport transfer during check in but was told this is not offered at checkout ....definitely another brickbat for the hotel....."
73,1686,"Mar 19 2008 	Great hotel	Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of March. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable with supersoft pillows (my description, guests can choose from a choice of different pillows if they wish). I particularly liked the design of the shower in the bathroom. There was enough room for two armchairs in the room but I have stayed in larger rooms in hotels of a similar calibre. Breakfast was served upstairs and there was a good choice. We had two meals in the pavilion restaurant which were reasonable and one meal in the Dum Phukt which was disappointing. We hired a car (with driver, wouldn't dare drive in Delhi) and he took us to the various sites that we wished to visit and waited while we looked around. Quite expensive, but worth it for our first trip to Delhi. A lovely hotel."
74,1686,"Mar 18 2008 	Dubya stays here	I went to New Delhi on a business trip and (although a very short stay) I enjoyed my time at the Maurya.There was a very nice pool area and I will be immitating their landscaping in my own backyard. I sat in the lobby waiting on an associate and really enjoyed the live piano player and his &quot;show tunes&quot; from the 30's and 40's.The Pavillion restaurant buffet was fantastic! I wish I had taken my camera so I could have gotten a shot of the desserts...an unbelievable array of decadence. I loved having my own personal French press for my coffee, too. Classy!One of the most renowned restaurants in New Delhi and the world is in the Maurya (I think it's called Bukhara) but I didn't get a chance to dine there.There is a wide array of shops in the hotel and I brought back several beautiful silk scarves for my wife. There were also gorgeous rugs which werre extremely reasonable and could be shipped back to the US. See my photo below.Dubya stays here when he comes to New Delhi...the US Embassy and other diplomatic facilities are just around the corner. The service was excellent and the room comfortable. When I get a chance to come back to India for a personal trip, I will definitely use the Maurya."
75,1686,"Feb 22 2008 	Great Hotel in New Delhi	Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks in September of 2007 for work. Room was not very large but sufficient for one person. The hotel staff was very nice and were very eagar to help. There are several restaurants in the hotel. Dublins is a Irish bar which turns into a club at night; a nice place to people watch but the food isn't terrific. Bukhara (which is one of the top restaurants in Asia) is a must for Indian cuisine. You can order their food up to your room or you can dine in. Dum Pukht is another restaurant which is you should dine in. The food was excellent but it is very bright inside the restaurant. I liked the Westview restaurant, you can pick out the food that you want and they will cook it right in front of you. The pool was nice, it wasn't very crowded and the water was warm at that time of year. I wouldn't recommend swimming at dusk because bats occasionally dive bomb the pool. I liked the hotel but it was isolated in the diplomatic enclave and you need a driver to take you around. It doesn't compare to a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons but it's one of the nicest hotels in India."
76,1686,Feb 6 2008 	Acceptable	I stayed in this hotel from 1/13 to 1/22/08. I had stayed in the adjoining Sheraton Tower last year but I was not too impressed. This time I was in the main Maurya hotel. I had booked the room on the internet. Booking and checkin were very smooth. I was lead to a very spacious suite which was well decorated and clean. I had put in a request for a quiet room and it seems that they had payed attention to this request. Room was turned over twice a day. Bathroom/showers and closet areas were excellent. Breakfast buffet was included in the price [$450] and it was excellent with a great Indian/Western selection. I have only 2 minor quibbles. 1] The breakfat area got quite crowded and chaotic on occasion. 2] Some construction noises were occasionally heard. Overall I had an acceptable experience. The price is steep but that is standard for top hotels in Delhi.
77,1686,"Jan 1 2008	Wish US based Starwoods were this great	First off, the Starwoods in India make a Platinum guest actually feel appreciated. I wish the US hotels could be as kind. We arrived late from a long set of international flights originating in the US and were quickly ushured to the Towers lobby for a more relaxed check in. Mints and candies were available on the desk and the Rajput unifoirmed doormen took care of our bags.The towers rooms are newly decorated with dark wood accents, an incredible curved mosaic shower, flat panel TVs, a touchscreen panel that controlled the lighting, DND, TV systems. There are bedside sleep aides includes earplugs, eye masks, lavender pillow spray. The hotel features two restaurants featured in the Thousand Things to Do Before You Die book. We tried Dum Puhkt and it was great but we were so sleepy we may not have fully appreciated it."
78,1686,"Dec 31 2007 	Awesome restaurant	We had a room in the &quot;new&quot; wing (but not the top level), and the rooms were nicely decked out but a little small. A very short overnight stay so didn't get to enjoy most of the hotel's facilities.We did go back for dinner at Bukhara, and it was one of the best Indian meals we have ever had anywhere in the world."
79,1686,Dec 17 2007 	Very nice (business) hotel	Spend 2 nights in The Maurya in November.From outside the hotel does not look attractive.... but once you enter the lobby you realize this might be a very nice hotel...The lobby is very nice.Executive rooms were very nice (not very big though). Very well equipped and very clean.Staff was very friendly and helpfull.Main restaurant is very nice place to have lunch or dinner.Even the bar/pub is nice and happened to be a very popular place for the local youngsters.A nice business hotel !
80,1686,"Dec 11 2007	Great business hotel	We stayed here twice each for one night during out stay in India. This really is a first class business hotel. I booked using Starwood points. My first room was very small and cramped but I was upgraded for my second room to a much larger room with a seating area and huge bathroom.We frequented both bars in the hotel. The Irish themed bar was dark and dingy but surprisingly appeared to be the more exclusive of the two bars. I preferred the golf bar which was just like any other business hotel bar to be honest.I found the concierge most helpful and they were able to track down an India cricket t-shirt for me and have it delivered to the hotel.The best part about this hotel however is the Bukhara tandoori restaurant. Voted one of the best restaurants in the world I ate there twice and on each occasion found the food to be incredible. Go for the raan of lamb, you will not regret it."
81,1686,"Oct 27 2007 	Great room great service.	We stayed here for a conference in Delhi and LOVED it. Our room was called a Garden View Deluxe suite and was actually the size of two hotel rooms (it seemed that on our floor, there were more of these &quot;double&quot; rooms than the regular rooms.&quot; The hotel was clean, luxurious, and hospitable. Rooms were modern (flat screen Plasma TVs), luxurious bedding, fantastic air conditioning, and were free from any odors even though smoking is common in hotel rooms in India. It is not perhaps five star by U.S. standards - but quite close. Some of our colleagues at the conference stayed at the Taj Palace and the Taj Mahal Mansingh. All agreed that the Sheraton actually had by far the nicest accommodations. Service was outstanding at all three hotels. If I had one complaint, it would be that the walls were a little thin. We could hear our neighbors a little and doors closing in the hallway woke us up a couple of times. However, it wasn't bad enough to really bother us at all. I would highly recommend this hotel."
82,1686,"Oct 25 2007 	Great Hotel	We had a great experience here. Wonderful, updated room with a great bathroom. This was definitely one of the best rooms we had in India. The buffet is also very good."
83,1686,"Oct 16 2007	Bukhara restaurant is way over rated	Although the hotel is OK (I wouldn't say world class), the restaurant Bukhara, is terrible.The tiny menu forces you to choose from the limited choices they provide. In addition, the waiters seem as if they have never waitered before, different ones coming to ask for a drinks order and a dessert order twice!In addition, I complained that their &quot;Rasmalai&quot; wasn't upto scratch and wasn't an original, the way the rest of India makes. The waiter argued that it was exactly as written and I had it wrong. He had the gall to stand there and argue with me...and didn't even take it off the bill, although we stopped eating it after the first bite.This restaurant is surviving on business travellers with nowhere else to go. Out in the real world of restaurants, their terrible service, average food and expensive prices would make sure they close down fast!"
84,1686,"Sep 22 2007 	Acceptable but not overwhelmingly impressive	Previous reviewers have emphasized that the hotel seems to be overpriced, and with that I am in agreement. While you might expect the hotel to be more impressive, it is simply average by Western standards. However, having emphasized its mediocrity based on western standards, I am told by many that it is one of the best hotels in the city. Moreover, despite the prices, I had no complaints with the hotel.The room was clean with a very comfortable bed, service was acceptable, and breakfast buffet was serviceable. It is a short (20 minute) drive to the airport for approximately $20/hotel sedan and located in the diplomatic center of the city (i.e., near the foreign embassies). If traveling for Delhi for business you can do a lot worse."
85,1686,"Jun 25 2007 	Great experience	Stayed here for a week for business. I was told my room was upgraded at check-in. On the fire escape map, it did seem that my room (in Tower 1) was indeed a bit larger than others.My room entrance leads to a small hallway that opens to a bathroom and closet area. The bedroom is separate. The room is extremely spacious and modern. In fact, it's one of the nicest hotel rooms I've been in. There is a flat panel TV (37 in?) and several English cable channels were available (HBO, CNN, BBC, Bloomberg, Travel, National Geo, etc.)The breakfast buffet (included with room) is really good. Great selection (Indian and Western). It's hard to not find something suitable. I was afraid of getting stomach bug, but that never happened eating in the hotel.Service is excellent all around. There was a fruit plate in the room that's replenished daily. Chocolate is provided on some days. The linens and towels were always fresh and newish. The front door staff (in white traditional uniforms) were always cheerful and ready to help.Check-in was a bit chaotic. There were a lot of people working behind the counter, but one would pass me to another. Other customers were cutting in to speak to the employee who is in the process of working on my check-in. I'm used to a more systematic approach in other hotels.Only a few downsides: 1) my air-condition stopped working and had to lose an hour of sleep while someone fixed it. 2) Banging noise on the morning of my last day, which I intended for sleeping late to recover."
86,1686,"May 29 2007 	Not a 5 star hotel	The room rate was nearly $500/night and, in my opinion, quite overpriced. I have stayed in hotels in Europe, the U.S., and other parts of Asia at that same room rate where the hotels were much more luxurious. My room was a standard room that had the look and finish of a standard room at a regular Double Tree Hotel. This hotel is not at all like other hotels in its price range, like the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. I would skip this one and stay at the Oberoi instead."
87,1686,"May 22 2007 	Sleepless night and not child friendly	We booked through SPG and had the option of the Meriden or Sheraton. We chose Meriden for our first night and then Sheraton for the 2 separate stays we planned during our golden triangle tour.We are a family of 4, our children aged 6 yrs and 4yrs. We would describe ourselves as a well travelled family who have experienced some fantastic 5 star hotels across India and Asia .We were travelling back from Amritsar on a late train and phoned the hotel to arrange pick up at the train station. We were pleased to find the driver at the allocated spot holding a name card so he could be easily identified. He speedily packed all 4 suitcases in the car and got us to the hotel in quick time.On our first stay ( 1 night ) we had the unfortunate experience of being there at the same time as government officials were holding some sort of conference. So as you can imagine, after a 5 hour train journey we had to go through security checks before entering the hotel ( including my 6 year old and his cuddly dog).This was followed by us having to use the staff lift ( via the store rooms ) as the guest lift was not working for some reason.?? We had a newly refurbished room which could not be faulted in anyway. It was ultra modern and the kids loved it, even though it was close to 1am by the time we got in.The morning breakfast was to die for - as in most 5 star hotels in india, with an array of breakfast options for every taste.Unfortunately our second stay ( after our tour ) was not so great. We were checked into the 5 th floor in an old style room , below the restaurant ( which we later found out was being refurbished.)It was comfortable and we just did not have the energy to complain to be moved to a newly refurbished room so we made do.We booked a club room which meant we could have complimentary cocktails in the evening. We paid extra for this . We were VERY disappointed to find that the children could not go into the Dublin Bar, or in fact any of the bars that were serving the complimentary cocktails. What really upset us was that there was no mention of these restrictions when we booked. When challenged we were advised that it was government policy? That was strange we thought - the Meriden were tripping over them selves to serve the children snacks whilst we enjoyed cocktails?After some discussion with the duty manager they allowed us to go into the business club lounge and the children were served soft drinks , the snacks were disappointing too.What really became the final straw for us was on our last night we were disturbed at 11pm. 3am and 5am with what sounded like furniture being dragged across the floor in the restaurant above . We were told that it was being refurbished and hence the noise but they would put a stop to it. Despite our phonecalls down to the duty manager the noise would stop for a short while then wake us again, which did not help considering we were catching a flight the next morning.We complained to the duty manager when we came to check out and they did not charge us for the room that night - however they still charged nearly 70 worth of tax???The hotel whilst 5 star, modern and luxurious was definately not child friendly and is more for business people. We will not be staying there ever again."
88,1686,Apr 25 2007 	recently renovated - liked it	needed an extra night in delhi and the Hyatt staff booked me in here Great result - stayed on the refurbed 4 th Floor - The Bakhara restaurant is in the top 35 restaurants in the world - and superb the tandoor lamb is fantastic - Great room - nice environment - staff very helpful - would go back !
89,1686,"Apr 23 2007 	Staff 	I cannot relate to the reviews on this site saying the staff is not helpful! I found them to be just the opposite!We got into a bit of a pickle, as we were riding in a taxi to the hotel for our last night in India and realized that our passports were no longer in our possession. We were supposed to be leaving about 26 hours from that time, so needless to say, we were a bit panicked.The staff at the Maurya Sheraton were so incredibly helpful to us in our little crisis. The head of security at the hotel phoned his friend in the police department and he told us to go upstairs to our room and rest while he took on the burden himself of going over to the station with our written &amp; signed statements to get us the necessary police report to get the police report that would require us to get the exit visa at the Indian Tourism Bureau the following day. (Oh yeah! Not only are the passports themselves gone, but also the little stamp inside them that we must have in order to get OUT of the country!!) They went so above and beyond for us, advising us on the steps necessary to get our act together--1st, going to the US Embassy and then to the Indian Tourism Bureau......and we actually got it all taken care of and made it to the airport and onto our flight with our emergency 1-year passport and the exit visa stamp. Whew!I don't know what we would have done if the staff at the Maurya Sheraton hadn't been so helpful to us. Plus, we spent quite a while lounging around the lobby and it was very pretty with murals that remind me of Orozco or Diego Rivera in the lobby. The room was plush and comfortable. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel!"
90,1686,"Mar 4 2007 	The Lap of Luxury	What a phenomenal hotel. I've traveled all over the world and rarely encountered such a great hotel experience. I had a room in the towers section that was beyond luxurious. The hotel staff was incomparable in terms of friendliness, efficiency and knowledge. The club lounge was spacious, beautifully decorated and had very attentive service. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous and enough to keep me going the entire day. The hotel fitness center was one of the best I've encountered. If you're going to Delhi, you won't be disappointed in the least by this wonderful hotel. And the mural in the lobby ceiling is just fantastic (not to mention the quality of the goods in the hotel shops). The hotel is close to the airport and not more than 15 minutes by auto rickshaw from the center of town and the railway station (convenient if you're taking a day trip to Agra)."
91,1686,"Mar 2 2007	Great but expensive	I was on business w/ friend; he has very expensive tastes. So i sort of had to stay hereAfter tax, my 1 night was $500. Ouch. Great room, nice interior, outside is sort of ugly, but who cares.Free breakfast (omlette...maybe best i've ever had)Only complaint is the $15 internet fee; miserly when you pay that much to get nickle and dimed. Plus my broke down (and i'm a computer guy)Otherwise, I'd never pay this much money, except i will note that after you see a parade of beggars and people living in the dirt, you don't mind spending money you have to sleep nicely.as ps, the nearby and related Le Meridian was about $80 cheaper. Just as good."
92,1686,"Feb 15 2007	OVERPRICED OVERRATED	I booked this hotel on their website and stayed for 8 days in Jan. 07. The booking process was not without glitches ,probably because of the fact that I got a room in the Sheraton Tower, located in an annexe of the main Maurya hotel.At $450 a night,it was the most expensive hotel I had ever stayed in.I was desperate to get a room in a hotel in south Delhi and I had very little choice because of the lack of availability of more moderately priced hotels.Also, I had booked the hotel at the last moment(big mistake). Check in was smooth and I was led to a spacious business class room.The big negative about the room was that it was fairly noisy because of ? construction work which seemes to go thru the night.I made a couple of complaints to o avail.However, I was provided with ear plugs,which helped a bit.Also included in the price was a full breakfast at the tower club of the hotel.The breakfast spread was excllent, and I could also order an Indian breakfast,which was also excellent. I also had a meal at the famous Dum Pukht restaurant.On the basis of that experience,I would call it the most overpriced and overrated restaurant in the world.I spent $50 on a meal which I could have had at KFC for $5. On the whole my stay was OK.Most people would rate this hotel a notch or two below the top 5 star hotels inDelhi i.e Taj Mansingh road,Oberoi Mathura road and the Imperial.Would I stay there again?Iwould probably avoid it as it is just not good value for money.5 star hotels in Delhi are taking advantage of the room shortage during peak season.To repeat my earlier advise&quot;BOOK EARLY FOR A HOTEL ROOM IN DELHI.&quot;"
93,1686,"Jan 19 2007 	Maurya Sheraton-Just Superb...	I had the pleasure of staying five nights through the New Year 2007. What can I say, the hotel is wonderful, truly a 5 Star hotel. As mentioned by someone earlier, the hotel has three separate divisions, the regular rooms, Tower rooms and the ITC One rooms. I had the opportunity to spend one night in the Towers and the rest in the ITC One rooms. If you can afford it ,ITC one is the way to go, but the Towers rooms were quite excellent also. The furnishings and fixtures are all that you expect from a five star hotel. I used SPG 50% off certificates (makes a big difference on a 5 night stay). Full buffet breakfast is also included, and if you are in the ITC One rooms, you can enjoy it in your room. too. The staff was wonderful and went out of their way to make us feel like royalty. Gautam at the Golf lounge and Arun at the Upper Crust (ITC One private lounge) were like my best friends, always attentive to my needs but unobtrusive at the same time. Because I had five nights, I could enjoy all of their restaurants (bit pricey) but definitely worth it. Bukhara is just superb. Arun would take care of all of my dinner reservations while I am enjoying complimentary evening appetizers and premium cocktails from 6-8 pm. The Spa/massage was wonderful too, $25 for 1 hour session, wow! This is truly a beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay here every time I am in Delhi."
94,1686,"Dec 2 2006 	Many small problems... mostly poor staff	Stayed at this hotel for the 3rd time this year, this time for a week due to a conference at the hotel. This review must be prefaced by saying that most hotels in India don't come up to normal Asia standards for service and quality of staff... so lower your expectations before going!ROOMThe room I had - in the club tower - was nice and large enough. In previous stays I had substantial elevator noise, but not this time. Rooms were often not cleaned until very late in the day, and one day I had to call several times for service.GYMThe gym is very limited although there are 2 new life fitness elliptical machines and 3 life fitness treadmills - also new - since last time I was there. It's difficult to work out for a long time as there is almost no air conditioning in the gym.FOODMost of the meals for the week of the conference were catered by the hotel and they were OK for conference fare. The last evening, a number of people from our group went to Bukhara and 100% got sick.SERVICEThis is where the hotel really falls on its face. Checking in takes 20-30 minutes and it seems like the staff are doing it for the first time, every time. There is no record of my guest history from this hotel despite previous stays nor of my preferences recorded through Starwood, of which I'm a gold member. Checking out was not possible as I left early in the morning and the hotel seems to shut down their computers from about 4 am until 7 am. I had to email/call the hotel 6 times to get a copy of my invoice... took 3 weeks to get it, and only the General Manager was able to assist.What hotel is better in Delhi? I'm not sure, although the Taj is pretty consistent. I won't stay at the Sheraton again if I have a choice."
95,1686,"Nov 12 2006 	Pretty Average...!	Over the last year, I've stayed at the Maurya Sheraton 5 or 6 times, last month being the most recent visit. The hotel is very consistent, but not quite what you'd expect from a Sheraton. The Hotel ItselfThe hotel is really three connected hotels - the Executive Tower (standard rooms), the Club Tower (nice), and the ITC One Club (very nice). Rooms in the executive tower are very small, and were noisy during my last visit due to construction, and even though management said that they would quiet down, they never did, and my room was changed twice before I found quiet.The Club Tower is nice and has an exceptional executive lounge with good service, nice snacks, and a very good breakfast. The ITC One Club is amazing - gorgeous (and spacious!) rooms, a private lounge, an in-room massage chair, and personal service is nice. The ITC One Club has a nice lounge with very good service - ask for Sandeep, one of the best waiters/bartenders in India.Checking in is a pain as all guests are first directed to the main desk, and those who have been upgraded are dragged to another check-in desk by an over-anxious bellhop. If the hotel knew what they were doing, they would have one check-in desk for all three....and not nearly as many bellhops.Food and BeverageThe Maurya is home to the top restaraunt in Delhi - Bhukara. Though the waitstaff there are terrible, the food completely makes up for it, and dinner is delightful. Be sure to befriend a bartender at the Polo Lounge or make reservations a week in advance if you want a shot at a table.The Dublin bar is fun, but they have trouble admitting they aren't a nightclub, and so they play very loud music. Try the homemade Bailey's...very good.The 24 hour cafe has good food, but the service is very slow.There are a number of other choices in the hotel, but these are the ones worth highlighting.Car RentalThe counter at the hotel, run by Travel House, provides pathetic service at sky-high prices. You're better off getting a car from a car rental company (like Avis or one of the local chains) than the hotel. I've had several drivers over the last 6 months, and they have all lacked knowledge about how to get around Delhi, insist on taking passengers to emporiums and tourist traps, and tend to have exceptionally poor english skills.SummaryOverall, this hotel is nice, but there are far better options for the price in Delhi. Try the Taj Palace next door or the Shangri-la near Connought Place for a better experience for a comparable price."
96,1686,"Oct 9 2006 	Overall Solid Hotel	This hotel was excellent in some areas and unsatisfactory in others. The service was impeccable. The hotel staff will cater to your every need. Most of the staff you will encounter speak English and are very polite. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. On the other hand, they are doing construction at the moment. It is incessant. Supposed to stop at 7pm, but that's not true. And that doesn't help when you're jetlagged and sleeping at odd times either. I moved to 3 different rooms in 3 days firstly due to the noise, then the bed being unbearable. Overall, a decently solid stay. Worth the money? Not sure about that."
97,1686,"Aug 1 2006 	We liked it!	In the winter of 2005-6, my wife and I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton on 3 separate occasions; twice in the Tower section, and once in the Club section. The Club was a bit cheaper ($275.00US) and we were lucky to get the newly renovated 12th floor. The first room we were given had the smell a freshly smoked cigar so we, being non-smokers requested and were given another room which was across the hall and had no odor. The room was on the small side, but very nicely appointed with great lighting which could be controlled from a panel next to the very comfortable king size bed, a huge flat screen TV with tons of channels and great sound, and a modern frosted glass bathroom. Room service was a bit problematic on this side of the hotel, and was very expensive. We had a tough time getting good indian chai! No excuse for that!The other times we were in the Towers section. It cost about US $325.00. The room was nice, bed was good, regular TV set. The bathroom had a mouldy odor coming from the drain, and although the staff tried, it could not be eliminated. There is no heat in the rooms, only air conditioning, but in January in New Delhi, it can get quite cold, and the room was a bit chilly. The best part of staying at the Towers is the butler service. Shortly after check-in, an immaculately groomed uniformed young man arrived at the door and introduced himself as our butler. Being regular Americans, we had no experience with butlers, but Chander took care of us in ways we had never known. He made the best tea we had in India, brought delicious juices, extra fancy shortcake cookies, helped our in-room meals, and offered to help with packing and anything else we might want! When my wife had a migrane headache, he made special ginger tea and gently put it by her bedside. It relieved her pain quickly, even after medications failed! He spoke very good English, and was interested and conversant without being overbearing and seemed to instictively know when to tend to us and when to leave us alone. All thee times we stayed at the Maurya Sheraton, we were promptly picked up at the airport in a new car with uniformed and polite drivers who drove the car nicely. The staff, while occasionally stiffly formal, did do their best to make our stay memorable and pleasant."

1,1688,Oct 29 2009 	would not choose again	We stayed one night only at this hotel as it was closer to the airport. We were greeted by a charming girl...but once she was gone there was not one friendly face except perhaps in the business centre. After all our wonderful memories in India...this one wasn't awful....just ordinary!! We had definitely been spoilt with our other choices.
2,1688,Sep 18 2009 	Discriminatory and bad service	I have been staying in this hotel for the last 2 years. The rooms have improved after a renovation. Rooms are ok but menu needs to increase at Eggspectation. The horrible thing is the hotel does not respect its guests. I was virtually turned out to wait on the road by one Mr. Bali inspite of staying in that hotel and having a company meeting there. You need to be careful as the staff at the counter looks ok but do not help when accosted with a problem. realised that hotel is discriminatory quite late.
3,1688,"Aug 29 2009 	Perfect Business hotel	What a location,Perfect to do business-Close to the airport,close to shopping centre,to restaurants,also for sight seeing.Must have food at the restaurant Ano Tai.Amazing breakfast spread at Eggspectation.The service needs to improve a bit though.Had stayed at The Grand in the same area but stayed away as heard it had caught fire some time back."
4,1688,Jul 29 2009 	Satisfactory	Stayed here on a business trip with a colleague for 5 nights. First impressions were that the hotel itself was clean and had a plush entrance. The area the hotel stood in was not very smart and was close to a busy road. There were no other hotels close by as these were mainly in the diplomatic area which was closer to the town. One good thing about this hotel is that it is close to the airport. This becomes of major concern once you realise how bad the traffic can be at certain times of the day and you're in a hurry to get to the airport. If your staying nearer the town centre you'd need to leave in plenty of time!There are a few reasonable restaurants just next to the hotel. Punjab By Nature is a good place to get a tasty curry at a fair price. Otherwise there are the restaurants in the hotel which offer choices based on cost. The rooms are basic but clean. A large screen TV provides lots of channels to choose from in English. Wireless internet available in the room. Free if your staying in the Club Rooms. Bottled water is replenished every day so no need to worry that you're going to run out. In a word I'd say this hotel would suit business travellers better than tourists due to its location. The pool is outdoor and looks OK.
5,1688,"Jun 10 2009 	Enjoied	I just returned from Delhi. I stayed on 9th and 10th June 2009. The hotel tariff is reasonable and have all facilities Viz. secretarial services, conference facilities and health club. The hotel is nearer to airport and is veery close to my meeting place i.e. Indian Roads Congress. The environment is excellant. The food and the service provided is very good. I enjoy staying in this hotel. This is 12th time I stayed."
6,1688,"Jun 10 2009 	Mix Luxary with Your Business	We had two day business meeting in the Hotel Vasant Continental. The hotel is magnificent and we experienced very prompt service. The staff as well as our event organizer was very helpful to us, we never had to worry about the logistics, could focus on the business, the meeting room chairs were causing pain in the back of many participants. The nice thing is almost entire hotel is non smoking zone, the space alloted for smokers was open &amp; very very hot, I personally think its good way to discourage smoking but it would be good if hotel provides a little comfortable space for smokers as few of our members were annoyed by the heat.The swimming pool is very small &amp; so gets crowded in morning hours so couldn't really enjoy it. There were three different restaurants inside the hotel giving choice within Chinese, Indian, Continental categories I could visit two of the restaurants I really liked the Chinese one. We paid INR 6000 plus taxes per night for a room on the which I thought excellent value. There were 2 double beds so the two of us had no difficulty in sharing room. Overall I would say this is probably the one of the better hotels I have stayed in on business trip. Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to save some costs &amp; its your routine meeting. But if you want to take on challenging issues wants to shape better team, mixing a little luxury with the business is must so this choice makes very good sense."

10,1688,"Mar 19 2009	Excellent base in New Delhi when using an organised group tour	Stayed at Jaypee Vasant Delhi when on a Page &amp; Moy Tour during Oct 08. As part of a 30 person group we enjoyed excellent service co-ordinated by our tour manager. Restaurants at the hotel were varied in cuisine offering different styles and excellent quality. Common areas of hotel/ reception were very roomy and cool. Bar was excellent with live music shows and all staff very very attentive and helpful.Partner called ahead for a surprise for Birthday whilst we were staying and staff arranged a bouquet, cake and card on arrival free of charge which was a wonderful surprise.Hotel is some distance from the centre of New Delhi- (about 40 mins in Tuk Tuk) but some would say that this is an advantage to be out of the centre. Immediately outside the confines the hotel boundary you will certainly experience Indian life- it's amazing. All in all a relaxing a calm oasis in amongst busy touring days."
11,1688,"Dec 20 2008 	Great Place	I stayed in Jaypee Vasanth for my business trip. First of all the location is very convinient. The food quality is excellant and to my surprise the hotel has provided a complimentary wine bottle in my room.The happy hours are really enjoyable.The only disturbing point was the renovation work going on in the hotel at that point of time.If I get an opportunity, I will not hesitate to Sign in once again."
12,1688,"Sep 15 2008 	Loved the Hotel	I stayed in the hotel for a week when I first shifted to Delhi-2 weeks back.the location is great and everything you need is a mere 2 minutes walk.My room was a good size compared to some of the hotels I have earlier stayed and extremely comfortable..loved the wooden flooring! My room overlooked the pool and I saw quite a bit of green which was a pleasant surprise.The staff was extremely warm and helpful and attentive. The best part is the restaurants(which I continue to visit), especially the Chinese and the cafe with quite an unusual name -Eggspectation..the food is excellent.I would highly recommend this hotel!"
13,1688,"Aug 31 2008 	If you're considering this hotel - DON'T.	This hotel is situated on a busy corner within a suburb of Delhi. Despite promising first impressions on entering the hotel, this hotel was very disappointing.Several problems occurred during my stay. Firstly, the hotel is undergoing refurbishment in some rooms and my room had a strong smell of glue / solvents. However, that smell was preferrable to the one that met me on entering the bathroom. There was a very strong odour of sewage and I had to request that the bathroom be re-cleaned (which it was). Later in the afternoon, I attempted a nap in the room but couldn't get to sleep due to the continual noise of traffic outside the window. Unfortunately, the noise of horns and reverse alarms continued into the night, making any sleep virtually impossible.The pool area looks good - it is set within nice landscaped lawns with comfortable loungers, but it's dificult to relax when strong whiffs of sewage meet you every 5 / 10 mins.Later, before dinner, I tried to take a shower only to discover that there was no hot water whatsoever in the entire hotel. I was starting to think that nothing else could possibly go wrong but NO - I was awakened by the sound of hammering above my room!In conclusion, if you MUST stay at this hotel - take ear plugs and shower beforehand."
14,1688,Apr 25 2008 	Oasis of Peace in a busy city.	This Hotel was selected for its peaceful ambience for a last evening in Delhi prior to flying out the following morning. About 20 minutes drive to Indira Ghandi Intl. airport. We were not disappointed in anyway and in fact the meal we had in the Restaurant ranked as one of the best of our trip. Authentically Indian. There are other restaurants in the building but this was the best.Check in was smooth and the room was well furnished and very comfortable indeed. Check out next morning was very smooth and trouble free. We are not frequent users of &quot;City&quot; Hotels but this more than met our expectations. Friendly without being fussy. Large but not soulless.Just what we needed for a good nights sleep before a long flight.There are gardens but we did not have the time to make use of them.
15,1688,"Oct 20 2007 	Good 4 star	A nice hotel. Not exceptional but clean, comfortable, good service and reasonable price - probably better classified as a good 4 star rather than 5 star."
16,1688,"Apr 3 2007 	comfortable hotel in south Delhi	This hotel is billed as a 5*, but not a European 5* , think in terms of a good 3* or average 4*.It's about 15 minutes from the main airport, be amazed by the changing route, dual carriage way leading down into a terrible road through a local shopping area, with mad traffic and every kind of transport you can imagine!The hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby, with the main restaurant leading off to one side and the bar to the other.The rooms are of a decent size, with all the normal facilities, very comfortable bed. A very poor hanging area in the wardrobe, constrained by the safe deposit box. A terrible hairdrier, take your own.Plenty of bottled water provided, don't use the tap water, it's not safe. Lots of staff around, they seem to be on the corridor most of the time to attend as required.The bar is very quiet most of the time, but there were several late night events while we there, local discos with terrible music ( it must be my age). Also 2 weddings in the extensive grounds, great to look at, not at all noisy.Breakfast was quite good, but ended promptly, don't expect the staff to leave the food out until you're finished, it just gets cleared away at the right time.The pool area was very clean and pool towels were always available. Good pool for lengths, not a leisure pool.The gym is on the second floor, is not advertised, but use is free, it has all the normal equipment and staff on hand. The sauna, steam room and jacuzzi all have a charge."
17,1688,"Mar 25 2007 	Excellent except for the Spa 	Most helpful and frindly staff!Excellent restaurants. Expensive, but quality &amp; service justify the price.Pool environment does not very much invite to the -impeccable clean- pool. No deck chairs, what a pitty.The massage room is far too small and the masseur not up to his job.Rooms are great, first class materials for furniture and installations, bath room was a delight, even though I booked the cheapest room!Needless to say thet the huge plasma TV with uncountable Sat-channels was a highlight.Small things like flowers, cookies, chocolates that keep appearing are a very nice surprise.Not a cheap place, but worth every rupee!"

The breakfast buffet which came with our room, (we booked a double) was delicious, they had both Western breakfast offerings, an omelette station, and South Indian breakfast as well, not to mention fresh fruit. Anything else that wasn't on the menu you could ask the staff and they would arrange it for you. I never tried the room service, as I like to be out exploring the city's hot spots, but there was always plenty of bottled water, my sheets and towels were always clean and fresh and they even gave us boxed chocolates every day. They also have a tea coffee maker and sugar, etc. Might I add that the bathrooms are spotless. The location just next to the Vasant Priya cinema is ideal, it's close to the city spots but not right on the main road so the rooms are quiet. I also arrived a day early from my trip to Nasik and they accommodated us at the last minute with an extra double. So I can't complain. LOVELY!"
19,1688,"Nov 20 2006 	Excellent Hotel	Excellent stay at this hotel! Rooms were clean and staff friendly! Breakfast was included in our stay which was at a nice restaurant within the hotel! - Also were provided with a bottle of wine and fruits when we first checked in! - There was a party at the hotel on fri night! hip hop night, which was excellent for us young people! overall i would recommend this hotel. The local area is quite good as it is right next to hotel, a few restaurants (would recommend the italian in the local area) ... All local ameneties nearby!"
20,1688,"Jan 28 2006 	Satisfactory stay	Located in south delhi, this hotel is a bit away from the business quarter. Rooms are adequate and service is what one would expect in a business-oriented hotel. A good chinese cuisine restaurant was a surprise."
21,1688,Jan 11 2006	Good hotel okay service....	We stayed in Jaypee Vasant Continental just for a night in transit between International and domestic flight. Hotel itself was clean and nice. Room was also well maintained and room-service was prompt and food was of good quality. Only thing that I didnt like was that while checking in we were treated very well- however while checking out they didnt even bother to pick our luggage and help with cab esp given that we were with an infant. Felt somewhat shoddy since they charged over $250 just for a nights stay.
22,1688,"Dec 19 2005	pleasant hotel near airport	Stayed here last week because all other hotels were booked. Hotel was pleasant surprise, as it was in a quiet area and had good food (though expensive) and newly refurbished and clean rooms. Hotel is located near JNU campus and airport. Also around the corner is western style shopping area. I found this hotel much better value for money than the Grand Intercontinental Hotel, where I stayed earlier this month, which was not very clean and looked like it could do with a bit of fresh paint."
23,1688,"Jan 9 2005	Consistently good	Recently renovated and modern. Excellent buffet style b'fast. Good in room dining. Only complaint is the insufficient access to internet. Two computers is inadequate and the service should be included with the room rate at a hotel of this caliber.For women, check out the well priced beauty parlor. I had my eyebrows &quot;threaded&quot; (plucked) - very well done. I will be using these services more on my next trip."
24,1688,Jul 12 2008 	Htel trs bien
1,1689,"Apr 19 2009 	Small Rooms	Hi, The hotel is very conviniently located at the middle circle on CP. The rooms are clean &amp; the beds are soft &amp; comfortable. There are 2 issues (1) The rooms are very small (2) One has to climb 2-3 flights of stairs to reach the room as its spread over 3 floors with no lift. Insist for discount &amp; upto 20% of the tariff will be waived."
2,1689,"Dec 7 2008 	better than average	Stayed at one other hotel in the same area, in comparison, this seemed more deserving of the &quot;mid-range&quot; or 2-3 star designation. The hallways were clean, well lit; well decorated. The rooms were larger than the other hotel; the bathroom was cleaner and larger---the bathing area had a little wall around it so the floor did not get wet, unlike many Indian bathrooms. The beds were clean and comfy. Internet access was pricey but available. The cost was higher, but as our last night in India, we desperately needed a nice clean send-off and it was. We were two women travelling and were treated well. Our friends stayed previously, and they had a nice time as well."
3,1689,"Nov 7 2008 	Jukaso Inn is not worth it	Very overpriced. Rooms are ok but no great shakes. For Rs3700 (don't forget extra taxes!), it's 50 pounds and you'd get better in London.Staff are not helpful and are just trying to sell you services.A chap is introduced to you as the travel desk. He says he can give free maps, free travel advice and 15mins free of internet service. Then he takes you on a 5 min walk to a travel agent that just trys to sell you tours!Return to hotel and ask for a bank and they say they will do the changing for you. Ask for a taxi stand and they say they will get you a taxi. All you want is some honesty but all they want is your money.Avoid."
4,1689,"Mar 16 2008 	Jukaso Inn Downtown - thumbs down	Our room was clean and comfortable. Seemed overpriced, but this was the only hotel we stayed at in Delhi so difficult to make a comparison. We were referred to a travel agency by the hotel, Perfect Holiday Travels, that was full of touts. Do not trust this hotel with any of your travel arrangements, or this travel agency."
5,1689,"Feb 28 2008 	Worst hotel I used in India but far from the worst in the world	I paid about $80 for one night here (the Connaught location) in November. I was able to check in early in the morning and was shown a room and told I could choose another if I wasn't happy with it. It looked fine to me, so I took it and got settled in.I didn't find the room itself to be dirty at all. It was comfortable enough, and the television worked. There was a window, but it was impossible to lift up the heavy curtains to actually look outside.The bathroom was another story. It was dirty and falling apart like I expected bathrooms in India to be (this was the first time it actually happened in a hotel though). You could tell that if you removed the mirror from the wall, you'd have a big gaping hole and be looking out onto the street. In the middle of a shower, I ran out of water completely.I had a tour picking me up at 5 a.m., and the front desk did actually call to inform me the car had arrived.Service was somewhat rude when I checked in and downright awful when I checked out. I informed the bellman I'd need a taxi, and he told me he would call. Apparently this never happened, and I came close to missing my flight because of it. I was waiting around for awhile until I finally asked the front desk who informed me no one had been called, and it would be about a 30 minute wait. Lucky for me, the taxi showed up right away, and I was able to escape this place in a hurry.If you really don't care what kind of place you're staying in, Jukaso is fine. It's not awful, but I paid about half the price for other hotels in India that were far nicer with better service than this one. However, considering the high prices in Delhi, it's probably not possible to do better for the money. It won't kill you to stay here, but you won't be yearning to go back anytime soon."
6,1689,"Dec 1 2007 	Can't believe this place was recommended by Lonely Planet	My girlfriend and I stayed at Hotel Jukaso Inn (the one in Connaught Place) for our first night in India on 10/11/07. We booked the hotel online in a last minute rush because other than our plane tickets and initial waitlisted New Delhi-Jaisalmer train ticket, we had organised nothing for our holiday in India. We paid 3850Rs + tax for one double room.We were very disappointed. We thought this standard may have been par for the course for this price in New Delhi/India, but as we tried other accommodation during our trip through Rajasthan/India, we realised that we had been clearly ripped off. The hotel room was dirty, small, and didn't have a window. The hotel service was poor. We learnt from our stay, however, that one of the best things to do with hotels in India is to check a few rooms out first, because there seems to be significant variation in a lot of places."
7,1689,"Nov 19 2007 	Not the right Juakso - oops?	I booked at the Jukaso Inn after reading a favorable review in Frommers Guide Book. Having never been to Delhi, I didn't realize that I had booked the WRONG Jukaso Inn. I booked into the downtown, Connaught Circle location, when the guide book was recommending the Sunder Nagar location. Our stay was fine. The hotel was really nothing special, nor terrible. Just average. But I mention it because it's possible that others who have reviewed this hotel might have been reviewing the wrong location?"
1,1691,Jun 15 2009	Very nice and quaint	This is a very nicely maintained and conveniently located guest house...the biryani and the butter chicken here rocks....
2,1691,Apr 26 2009 	Okay but that's al	Okay but when I arrived they didn't seem to have to my booking and we had negotiate for what I thought we already had. Be careful.
3,1691,"Apr 16 2009 	There's better available for Cheaper	I stayed here for 3 days for a business trip. It is definitely well located on near Mathura Road, however, that's were all positives of the place ends. The forst shock after seeing the place was that they were charging Rs. 4,500 / per night. As if that was not all, for some reason they refused to accept card payments (this may have been a temporary problem, in all fairness). There is no alcohol available in the place, but a waiter will get you one on Order and some commission. The food in room service was terrible. Rooms were just decently hygenic and not really as clean as one would prefer. Staff is helpful in all commercial services asked for, but courtsey is another matter altogether. My conclusion was that for this money, I know of better places. Avoid."
4,1691,"Mar 20 2008 	Terrible!	We travelled from Delhi to Rajasthan to Goa &amp; back to Delhi so had taken a look around this hotel on our first visit to Delhi. We'd been shown a large clean room with a high standard of decor &amp; a marble bathroom...but on that occasion we didn't stay as we managed to negotiate an even better deal at (the normally twice the price) Jukaso Inn down the road. We decided to 'treat ourselves' on our last night of our world trip and booked the Maharani from Goa via email &amp; exchanged 3 emails confirming the booking &amp; giving our flight arrival times. When we arrived at the hotel at 7pm (the time we had indicated) we were told that we had arrived too late and that the hotel was full! They also denied having received our emails despite having replied to them. We were not too pleased as we were leaving at 4am the following morning. The manager said he would see what he could do &amp; we were left sitting in the lobby for over half an hour while he avoided our gaze &amp; dealt with other enquires. We asked what was going on &amp; he said he was waiting for a guest to leave who was on a late check out. After another half hour &amp; no update it transpired that this guest was in a restuarant with his wife &amp; was not due to be back until 11pm. When we (quite angrily by this stage) said we would not wait until 11pm he said he would find us a &quot;nice room in another sister hotel&quot;. I've travelled to India many times and know never to accept this offer! The sister hotel is usually a very poor standard yet they'll try to charge you the same rate. After another hour of arguing with this very arrogant man, we finally flipped &amp; resorted to pretending to be from a very important organisation &amp; saying how disappointed we were with the treatment &amp; that our organisation would not use the hotel again. His attitude changed immediately &amp; suddenly there was a room available. Unbelievable.HOWEVER...the room was right at the top of the hotel, was small and shabby with a disgusting bathroom and a hole in the bath. We tried to complain again but the manager had made a hasty retreat home by this point &amp; we were too tired to argue any more.So we were still charged 50 (which is a LOT of money in India) for a terrible room &amp; terrible service. Unfortunately this is a pretty standard experience in India. The hotel had also offered to pick us up from the airport for 850RPS. We declined &amp; took a police-approved prepaid taxi for 150RPS from the little booth at the airport. You don't mind a hotel charging you a little bit more...but 700RPS more??So - DON'T STAY HERE! If you're not on a budget stay at the Jukaso Inn and negotiate a good deal. If you are on a budget you'll be struggling as Delhi is not the place to find good, clean, cheap rooms."
5,1691,"Jan 25 2008 	Not so good the second time....	I returned to the Maharani Guest House for 3 nights after having stayed there in January 2006. At that time I posted a positive review on TripAdvisor. Upon my return to the Maharani I found that the tariff had increased considerably (now $75.00 + 12.5% tax for a single room). The desk clerk recognized me and asked the manager (who also recognized me) if he should offer the lower tariff I had paid in 2006. The manager quickly dismissed his request. Neither realized that I understood Hindi. I felt no reason to barter over the price since my visit was planned at the last minute and my previous stay had been good.I was given a very small room at the back of the hotel. It could be accessed by the lift or stairs from the lobby. The carpet in the room was disgustingly dirty and the walls were in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom was clean and the hot water was adequate.There was a writing desk in the already cramped room and I pulled open a drawer to locate the room service menu, only to be greeted by a rather large cockroach. I had never seen roaches in the hotel before and this was the only one I discovered in my room, but I will admit it made for a rather uncomfortable stay. I asked to change rooms but was told that was not possible as the hotel was full.The service was still a bit creepy, with housekeepers lurking around my door waiting for a tip and the afternoon desk clerk was still a bit condescending. The food was just as good as before and the prices had not changed. The location is great but I cannot recommend this hotel after my last stay. There are plenty of other hotels in New Delhi that are a better value for the money."
6,1691,"Jul 10 2007 	Not so good...	After spending a few days in the Indian Islamic Cultural Center and the Crowne Plaza, we went around the Sundar Nagar to find a place to stay for the day before we go to the airport. The Jukasso Inn was really nice but also very expensive. We also went to the La Sagrita but I did not like it there. In the end, we decided to stay at the Maharani Guest House. The room is old and smells like chemicals. It does not look that clean too. I must however say that the location is really nice. However, I enjoyed the Lodhi area better because it was peaceful and the restaurant at the Indian Habitat Center is the best!If you have hired a car and a driver, I suggest you go find another place."
7,1691,"Jun 14 2007	Good value for money with great location	Stayed here a few months ago and found it to be good value for money. The location is very attractive and central. Rooms are clean and comfortable. People expecting all the amenities of a 5 star hotel will be dissapointed...note that this is a quaint guesthouse, and serves the purpose of a good nights sleep and some small snacks. Will recommend this place and stay again."
8,1691,"Feb 21 2007	Decent hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2007. Decent place for the price ($70). The location in Sundar Nagar is excellent and close to India Gate. But I recommend hiring a taxi all day (about Rs 1200) as most Indian cities are not great for walking, the traffic, dust and fumes are a bit overwhelming for my taste.The rooms are large (we had Double rooms) and the bathrooms are large/sufficiently clean.Be careful about the breakfast. I recommend masala omlette rather than the fixed breakfast menu. Avoid Orange juice and go for for well boiled coffee.For the first time travelled, I also discourage staying in Pahar Ganj, Karol Bagh or any old Delhi areas. Stay in New Delhi which is suprisingly clean and beautiful.Given the lack of decent hotels in New Delhi for under $100, I think Maharani is a good choice. They also arranged a car for the trip to airport (Rs 400). We arranged all day taxis on our own from Kumar Travels listed in Lonely Planet.The hotel has too many people on staff and they all expect a tip. When we asked for a towel at 1am, TWO people arrived with one towel and expected a tip ! On the way out, I counted about 10 people helping us load our bags in the taxi. I simply paid Rs 100 at the front desk to keep everyone happy."
9,1691,"Feb 10 2007 	Do Not Stay At This Place!	We stayed at this hotel for three nights while we were in Delhi and would never stay here again. We arranged for airport pickup through the hotel and our driver took us on some scam diversion to a &quot;travel office&quot; where we urged to pay MORE money for our hotel even though we had already paid with a credit card. After this long diversion, we finally arrived at our hotel room to find that the bathroom was not clean--no need to go into details but I'll just say that it had been used before our arrival. The next morning we got up at 5:00 am to catch a train to Agra and almost fell over the staff who was sleeping in the hallway. It was bery clear that the staff sleeps lined up in the hallway every night. Enough said, DO NOT stay here!"
10,1691,Mar 19 2006	what a dump!	i thought this hotel was a dive. really really over rated and over priced by 50% at least. for a little more money you can find a lot better than this dump.
1,1694,Delhi	Looks like an apartment converted to a Hotel.Interiors are decent and well maintained.But no good support from reception regarding travel or tourism.Food provided is not good enough and not on time. Probably getting from some other source.No other activity in the hotel when you come out of the room. Overall a congested feeling.
2,1694,"Oct 14 2009 	Good service	The hotel is ok, clean and have good service. The staff was very helpful, and everytime we had questions they helped us imediatly. We booked a 4 days trip with them and thaught it was very good. We had our own guide and driver that we were very satisfied with. We could enjoy our vaccation and see the real India in a way that we could not do by ourselves."
3,1694,"May 29 2009 	Warning:-The SUCKS	I had booked a super deluxe room with the hotel for one night, since i had to board a train back home from my honeymoon trip.I reached the hotel at night around 23.00 and was led up to my room. The room had a torn bedsheet which I told them to change, upon removing the bedsheet we saw a gapping hole in the mattress cover too.The replacement bedsheet had oil stains on it and looked pretty old from the blue stains.The bathroom had two torn towels, in fact it seemed they had been used for more than they should have, since they were nearly thread bare.The refrigerator was kept in a wooden closet and at one corner you could see a large damp patch due to improper drainage of defrost water.The AC had a front panel that was stuck on with CelloTape.The room was too small to be comfortable and felt suffocating,even for normal rooms charges, i would have not booked it, had i known about it, leave alone &quot;Superior Deluxe Room&quot;.The elevators moved with a jerk as if it was to giveaway any moment now.We were dog tired from our trip and since it was for a night, we had to put up with the hotel.I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody since they are cheating people by giving fancy names to rooms which by any standards are inhospitable.A huge THUMBS DOWN for this hotel."
4,1694,"Mar 12 2009 	Disgusted! - in league with one of the commision scammers	After we hopped into a taxi at the airport (pre-paid no less) who conveniently couldn't speak English when we gave our hotel address, we were whisked off to a so called tourism office who then showed us Megha Palace.The sad and dreary reception is manned by a surly, sour and rude man who was reticent to provide us with fast or friendly service. After he huffed through the sign-in process we were shown the stuffy rooms. We were shown our room by a sleazy character who would not leave us in peace and confronted with filthy linen, grimy and paint peeling on the walls, exposed wires from light fittings, leaky plumbing, abused and dilapidated furniture. I didn't expect much in Delhi, but this was the pits for the US$35 night they were asking....I can unreservedly say it is way too much for what it is, and what it is, is extremely poor.When we tried to checkout the following morning the managers attitude had not changed. He in fact told us to sit while he quietly called the so-called &quot;tourist information man&quot;, or otherwise known as commison/scammer. who intercepted us. We were promptly whisked off again to try and make bookings for tours we did not want. Thanks Megha Palace!AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS! We have stayed in some low budget places, and this one is not value for money nor is it an ethical operation."
5,1694,"Oct 13 2008	Pleasent stay	I Stay one Month in this hotel.they pick me from airport.Hotel is very clean , hot &amp; cold water exxellent. Room is good size , King size bed . Metro Station on walking distance. food is very good in resonable Price. Staff Courteous ,becuase of stay long for medical perpose Owner reduce cost ."
6,1694,"Apr 2 2008 	An unreliable unprofessional hotel	My wife and I had reserved a two-night stay at the Megha Palace, including free airport pickup (which is offered if you stay two nights or longer). In our email we clearly specified the dates of our stay and the arrival date and time of our plane from Europe. The hotel confirmed our room and airport pickup bookings. But after going through the airport formalities and picking up our luggage (it was around 1:45 am), we found there was no one from the hotel to receive us. Lots of other hotels had drivers waiting for arriving passengers. You can imagine how bad we felt not seeing anyone holding a sign with our name. When I called the hotel up, they said they had no reservation for us for that night, but told us to take a pre-paid taxi to the hotel which they would reimburse. Naturally we assumed they had a room available. The taxi driver had a hard time finding the hotel - and we ended up having to call the hotel on our cell phone, which meant a long-distance call from Europe to India!! We gave the cell phone to the driver so he could get directions. When we got to the hotel at about 3 am, it turned out they had no room booked for us for that night and told us we needed to wait until 5 am when one of the rooms was supposed to be vacated. Why didn't they tell me this on the phone when I called from the airport?? We were very tired and sleepy and naturally wanted a room right away. So they booked us a room in another hotel in the area, but it wasn't that close - and we were told we had to vacate the room by 8 am!!! Having no choice, we proceeded to the hotel in the same taxi. After a sleepless few hours in the second hotel (accompanied by a few cockroaches and the constant noise of people talking, shouting and moving about), we went back to the Megha Palace (they sent a car for us). The second hotel had no rooms for the following night. The Megha Palace is adequate (though, like the other hotel, it was fairly noisy at night and there were some roaches in the room), and they did reimburse us for the taxi, BUT why did we have to go through all this??? We clearly specified the dates, and the hotel confirmed our room booking and the airport pickup. This is unacceptable. I was later told by an Indian relative that it is best to book by phone. I would recommend calling the hotel you've booked the day before to make sure they know you're coming. But...in Delhi please don't stay at the Megha Palace, Megha Sheraton or Madonna hotels (which belong to the Karmesh group)!"
7,1694,"Mar 13 2008 	travelling alone in India	I organised my travelling in India, 25 days, with the help of Megha Hotel since it provided appropriate room and service for the price, and returning time to time back from the trips, I had the feeling to return back home to the hotel. I got excellent help in organising my trips both by train, sleeping trainand by car and driver, with prebooked hotels of good quality in several villages. Special thanks for respecting by budget for the trip, I felt trust, I was safe, and picked up, and dropped at the railwaystations during the night as well. I had the pleasure to meet people from India, on business, and to speak to local people knowing well the traditions, and sights. in the hotels.Thanks for Mr.Pintou for the organisation, help, advice and care."
8,1694,Oct 7 2008 	Das Hotel ist sauber und der service ist gut.
1,1695,Nov 20 2009 	great service	Picked me up at the airport as stated very nice. Arranged taxis to show me around city. Excellent room service. Incredibly helpful staff. Complimentary breakfast and internet use. Felt very safe and enjoyed my stay
2,1695,"Oct 14 2009 	basic budget hotel	I booked at this hotel because they arranged what sounded like reliable taxi service. I came in late and left early. I could have made the taxi arrangements myself but was pleased to have someone else do it. Was also pleased that the arrangements were on time. I'm disappointed that budget hotels in Delhi are pretty highly priced compared to other places in the world and for the amenities they offer. This is a budget hotel. You'll get what you pay for (according to Delhi rates).Nevertheless, the hotel delivered what they said they would: taxi service (priced higher than if I would have arranged it myself but that's o.k.), wake up call, and agreed upon room price. That all goes a long way."
3,1695,"Jun 19 2009 	nice place to stay when coming to Delhi	That was my first visit to Delhi.I arranged with Brother Naresh ( that s how we call each other now ! ) through Internet . Room nice , services nothing to complain about, very friendly staff, especially Mr Kashmeera , the Driver , and the night security . Friendly advices from the Boss who is around almost round the clock ! . The nearby snack , OMELETTE , is fantastic and nice staff very helpful. In brief , I had a pleasant stay at this place in Delhi.Thank you Brother Naresh , you made my Delhi trip a memorable one . I will come back next year . from Brind Rambhojun , Mauritius , tel [--]."
4,1695,"Apr 28 2009 	Meghagood	When I first came into the hotel, I was bedazzled. It was more than I expected. It was nice, and why? First things first, the reception are energetic towards their customers and are ready to offer help. Second, the rooms are small but comfortable and the beds are enought o make you sleepy in the cold winter nights of Delhi. The owner of the hotel is a firendly man and he would arrange car services whenever tourists want a tour of the city. When it comes to Delhi, the owner of Megha Sheraton can give the guests valuable advice and has access to the latest information about Delhi and himself having connections and friendships with high-ranking people in India's capital.The only negative feeling I experienced is that the bellboys can hover around you for quite a long time and expecting guests to take their services for the sake of tips. But I guess this is common in India. Other than that, the boys can be helpful and ready to talk to you in case of service. Also, the television can have some antenna problems and hot water can be limited during the winter season but the television has great programmes and one can feel relaxed after a nice hot bath. Overall, this hotel is a great stay for those visiting Delhi with helpful hotel staff and a caring owner. This great place is ideal for backpackers, small families, couples and even business people. Besides, it is wlakign distance to some good local restaurants and sidewalk shops."
5,1695,Feb 4 2009 	Megha cool	Hotel Megha Sheraton is a really nice place to stay for some days in Dehli. The rooms are clean and full equiped. The staff is friendly. The boss is a nice and friendly man who give good advices and organise really interesting tours with car and driver.
6,1695,"Nov 21 2008 	great meghas	Cordial service and exemplary care, they have their own cook upstairs . order in service by telling them to get what you want.prices are reasonable. ramsriram1@gmail.com willl be glad to answer any question you have. dont forget to try some fresh pomegranate juice from the stall next door. if you have problem with tel services go to the counter and ask for help. check with naresh bhatia for special service."
7,1695,Nov 10 2008 	Freindly and customer oriented	The hotel staff is friendly. The prices are very reasonable. They didnt try to charge higher even though they realize Im foreigner. Room condition is average. WIFI is available only in the reception area and first floor rooms. In-house trip arrangements facilities are there for very reasonable prices.
8,1695,"Sep 13 2008 	A Most Pleasant Experience	After a recommendation from a friend in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, I contacted Mr Naresh Bhatia via email. His response was prompt and we booked in for a period of two weeks, including our stay here and tours of Haridwar/Rishikesh and Agra/Jaipur/Pushkar. Mr Bhatia's professionalism, ambience, support and efficiency are most commendable. The hotel staff are also most friendly and efficient. Our tour guide/driver Mr Kashmira is most reliable, helpful and trustworthy. We had a fantastic time and I recommend Mr Bhatia's service and tour arramngement to all visitors to Delhi."
9,1695,"Jul 23 2008	don t go there!!!	dont go there!!!you will pay 55$ per night....that s crazy!!! you can find a better place for 5-10$ per night like in Pahar ganj..we were really desapointed by this hotel, people were not nice, we didn t see any internet cafe and no breakfast!!the pick up from airport was free but they try to ask for money...hopefully i had print the e-mail where they told me it was free!!it was such a crapy place, dirty room with cocroaches everywhere!!!please, find anothere place... this is a real bad place!!!"
10,1695,"Mar 18 2008 	Free Airport Transfers at the Megha Sheraton	Megha Sheraton is a standard Indian business class hotel. The same company owns two other hotels in the area. I stayed for 4 days, which gave me free pick-up and drop at Delhi Airport. This bonus was the main reason for choosing the hotel for my first few nights in Delhi. The driver was waiting at the airport (very useful as many international flights arrive and leave late at night) so I could avoid the taxi touts. The hotel is well located, being within easy walking distance of the inexpensive and efficient Delhi Metro, though it wasn't well known by taxi drivers (get a hotel card). The affable manager will make tour arrangements for you in advance if you wish (I took a day trip to Agra, and a bus tour of Delhi). The free breakfast is offered at the Madonna Hotel just around the corner. The hotel isn't as well maintained as it should be, but I found in the next 6 weeks that that is a common problem with hotels in India. It was reasonably clean. I paid US$55 per night with breakfast and the free airport transfers. Contact from the website and e-mails are responded to promptly."
11,1695,"Mar 7 2008	Delhi Trip	Excillent service was provided by hotel staff,Hotel is centerly located close from allmost everthing. Room was cleaned and comfort with air and hot water .All the ture was well planed and not so costly at all ."
12,1695,"Feb 13 2008 	Sure To Return	The hotel rate in India especially in Delhi is getting higher and higher due to an economic boom. However, this hotel (I stayed 3 nights at Hotel Megha Sheraton) offers much higher standard than the average hotel with such room rate could offer. Staff are very kind and hard working. The hotel arranged the efficient tour for me who stayed and visited many places for a short time. Especially for me who is looking for the best investment places in Delhi and suburban area like Gurgaon, Noida as well as Ghaziabad, I am very much thankful for hotel owner's advice and very reasonable cost to hire the car. The cost of hiring car with good drivers was much lower than all other hotel could provide. I could save my money quite a lot. I really thank for owner Mr. Naresh and I promise I return again with my son.NY and son"
13,1695,"Feb 6 2008 	Serviceable	They picked us up at the airport...the first big plus. Would not want to negotiate taxi at night to unusual location at Delhi airport.When I booked on the internet site, they said Mehga was full, so pushed us into the Madonna for the first night, which is more expensive. However, the rooms are identical. Then we switched back to Megha. It might have been a ploy to feel the Madonna. The rooms were pretty clean . The breakfast was pretty good. The location is great. In a pretty wealthy area, but it wont look like that if its your first stop in India. They arrange taxi. Also, its a short walk to the metro, which we found more fun as being on foot frees you from the tricky taxi drivers and allows you to see more of the street life. I would recommend doing the inner city sites by metro and foot. Its a very safe city once you realise that there are always a thousand eyes watching each other.The room was quite pricey for what you get (even by 2 star 1st world standards) and especially so compared to the rrest of india. But that is Delhi unfortunately. Would I go back? Probably, mainly b/c the rest of the stuff in the price range sounds terrible and b/c of the good location and b/c I felt safe. P.S. The rooms at Megha and Madonna are identical in quality...there is just a higher price at Madonna and a tacky but newer foyer. Also, I got bitten by bed bugs at the Madonna hotel the one night we stayed."
14,1695,"Feb 6 2008	Budget traveller	It was through my elder brother's recommendation that i considered Mega Hotels in Delhi. Being a budget traveller, i came to Mega Sheraton and to my amazement found it to be really really good. The rooms were clean, spaceous and averagely decorated. The hotel has got all the facilities -Cable TV, phone, tour packages, laundry &amp; room service etc. The staff are well mannered and informative. The Best aspect about the Mega Hotels as compared to any other hotels in Delhi is the entertaining, friendly , warm ,cooperative and helpful persona of Mr. Naresh Bhatia! Understanding my student budget restraints , he expertly come up with a complete 11 days detailed tour plan that made my very first travel experience of India to be thrilling and memorable! All in all for budget travellers - do not hesistate to stay at Mega Sheraton and for VIP's i recommend Mega Madonna!!"
15,1695,"Feb 5 2008 	Fine enough for cheap Delhi hotel	I have mixed feelings on this hotel... On the plus side - it was cheap, which is tougher and tougher to find in Delhi; they picked us up from the airport right on time, which can not be overvalued, especially early, early morning; they arranged a good sightseeing tour for us that was such a nice surprise; they had a TV; the manager was really friendly and personally helpful; it was reasonably clean.On the negative side, and most of these are to be expected at this price point... the bed was a rock (common in India); the street was loud (seems like all of Delhi is); the bathroom was dirty-ish (no where near western standards); the food was the worst we had in all of India, by far.That being said, I'd probably stay there again... for ~$60us, it probably can not be beat in delhi."
16,1695,"Jan 28 2008 	Hotel Megha Sherathon is a very nice place to stay in delhi	We are very happy to know this place, because it is so calm and clean. Since several years we always stay in Megha Sheraton Hotel, because we like the promp and reliable service and the feeling of beeing secure, it feels for us like coming home.Thank you very much to the owner Mr. Bhathia, who is always open to help and very friendly.We heartly can recomment this place"
17,1695,"Jan 17 2008 	basic and noisy but very helpful owner	this hotel is in quite a run down area, it was very basic the room was clean but the sheets were quite stained, bring a sleeping bag if going to budget hotels in india!! walls are thin and hotels very noisy!!the owner was lovely and very helpful giving us tips on what to expect in delhi. breakfast is served at the neighbouring hotel madonna, it was slow service and far from desirable food! location is not too bad at the end of the road is karol bagh and the metro which leads to connaught place, the metro is cheap 8rupees and easy to use aswell as suprisingly clean and modern. this hotel isnt great and you can get better for your money, such as hotel broadway."
18,1695,"Jan 16 2008	Megha Sheraton	I always believe that the best stay in Delhi is a short stay in Delhi. The Megha Sheraton was convenient as far as that account went. They did a nice job arrange for an airport pickup for my parents after their international flight, and were courteous and helpful throughout the stay.Karol Bagh was a little out of the way and hard to access by taxi in the middle of the day, which was a bit of a draw back, particularly when shlepping across traffic, after a rickshaw wallah just gave up trying to get us back there."
19,1695,"Dec 29 2007 	Depending on the price could be a good value	Pluses: the hotel is clean, and the rooms have comfortable beds, tv, and some basic amenities. The location -- unknown to me from my previous visits to Delhi-- is actually pretty pleasant. It is a short cab ride to attractions, and the neighborhood has many shops and services that you can walk to while being (amazing!) pretty much free of touts and hawkers -- one of the most normal areas of Delhi I've stayed in.The staff was extremely helpful to me, and the breakfast was very nice. There were a few dubious things -- when I asked them for a cab to the airport, they offered me one for $12, but when I later booked one on my own for 400 rupees, they told me that they could arrange one for 350.Minuses: the public areas of the hotel are pretty shabby-looking.Room walls are thin, so you get noise both from the street and from other guests. It was cold at night, and the room had no heat (although perhaps they would have brought me a heater if I had asked). The bathroom worked well-enough, but there were some oddities (why is there a large bucket underneath the shower head?). If you are in Delhi between flights, then you shouldprobably pick a hotel that is closer to the airport.My impression is that this hotel was once terrible, and thatit has gotten much better under new management. It still has some ways to go until it is actually nice, butI was satisfied with my stay. They delivered exactly what they promised, at the price (60 US) that I had been looking for. On the other hand, I have heard that this hotel charges foreignerssignificantly more than locals, and the other reviews on this site seem to confirm this. If you are interested in staying here, I would advise getting a hindi speaker to make the reservation for you."
20,1695,Dec 9 2007 	Great place to stay	We have a wonderful stay at this hotel recently. We were picked up at the airport which was fantastic and driven straight to the hotel to catch up on some sleep. The next nmorning we spoke to the Manager of the hotel who then boked us a car and driver and accomodation for the next 2 weeks travel around northern India. It was simply a wonderful trip and just so easy thanks to the staff at the Megha Sheraton. The hotel is very clean and very friendly with value for money and a very safe area. I would recommend it to anyone and would advise you to talk to the Megha tours operators and get them to organise your holiday for a fraction of the price we were quoted in Australia for the same trip.
21,1695,"Oct 22 2007	Ok for its price	Background: Paid USD65 for my parents and me to stay for one Sat night. Review: For its price, it is a rather good option. It's abt 4km away from Connaught Place (where the action is), but cabs/auto rickshaws are easily available outside the hotel. The hotel, although located within a residential area, looks safe enough. The manager/owner of the hotel was also kind to drop us for dinner at a nearby location. The only grumble i have about this place is that i spent the first 5 mins in the room killing cockroaches! The toilet was not in a good condition and the pillow cases are stained and lumpy. Verdict: It's a place to stay only if you are really low on cash, not afraid of insects and is totally no-frill."
22,1695,"Oct 3 2007 	Good service reasonable rates humble but correct accomodations	We spent four nights at the Megha Sheraton. The hotel would be too basic for many people's tastes, but at 2000 Rs it was an excellent value and served our needs just fine. You won't see many foreigners in Old Rajender Nagar, but being in an &quot;authentic&quot; neighborhood was part of the appeal. We used the airport pickup/dropoff service (four trips total) and recommend it.The biggest attraction is the tourist assistance provided by manager Naresh and the a/c hotel cars and drivers that are available for hire. Naresh's service is great, his advice is excellent, and the rates are VERY reasonable. We hired one of the hotel cars for the day (7 hrs for 700 Rs) for a tour of Delhi and a quick drive by the sights of New Delhi. (Three of those hours were actually on a bicycle rickshaw arranged by our driver.) Naresh also arranged a tour of Agra (daytrip by train, with car/driver for the day).We had Indian breakfasts in the little restaurant at the adjacent sister hotel Madonna. Western breakfast also available."
23,1695,Aug 11 2007 	Excellent service 	We arrived to Delhi without too many plans and didn't really know what to expect from our stay. The Megha Sheraton is a good starting point for any journey in the northern parts of India. Thanks to Mr. Naresh Bhatia (the hotel's manager) our two weeks in India were some of the best weeks we have ever experienced. He organized a fantastic tour for us through Rajasthan and Agra (Taj Mahal). We had a private car + driver with us and saw some very beautiful places. All promises were kept and everything was according to expectations. We can warmly recommend the Megha Sheraton for you.
24,1695,"Jul 9 2007 	Mega good service!!	This hotel is such a find! As a single woman, life can be difficult in a foreign country. But not at Hotel Megha Sheraton. I was brought here by an Indian friend and from the moment I arrived, I was treated with the utmost respect and kindness. Everything was provided for me, unlimited Chai and Indian coffee and interesting chats with the affable owner, Mr. Naresh Bhatia. His kindness and personal service are second to none. Nothing is too much trouble and honesty and friendliness are the keynotes of this home away from home. I always felt safe and secure. The room service is prompt and freindly. The room service waiters never hassle for tips and for me this is a first for India. Anything I wanted was available to me. My business cards were made for me on the same day as my CD was sent out from the hotel. I felt totally satisfied with all this hospitality. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and in India and I would honestly rate Hotel Megha Sheraton as No.1!!! Also, the food sent by room service was always delicious and fresh. What more can I say?"
25,1695,"Jul 5 2007 	Megha Sheraton - Value for money	We contacted the proprietor through email with apprehensions after having searched the net . Mr. Bhatia responded quickly with the rates and availability of the rooms. The rate was Rs. 1800 for an A/C room and sufficient to accommodate our two kids, aged 11, 6 years. We opted to be picked up from the airport. We were picked up from the airport and reached the hotel which is located in a residential area in about 45 minutes. The rooms are clean and tidy. Mr Bhatia arranged for our tour to Agra and Jaipur which we enjoyed thoroghly. Downside: The hotel does not have an in house restaurant but food is made available through the nearby sister Hotel Madonna"
1,1696,Sep 13 2009	a place where leisure and comfort coincides.	it's a wonderful place to stay and enjoy the city. at the end of the day u get a good food and a lovely place to sleep.
2,1696,"Jul 21 2009	Great stay !!	Date 19th June, 2009We booked the room , market facing in the bustling street. The hotel is nice and has homely comforts. Moreover, the in house restaurant is the best in the area. We felt safe and comfortable. Highly recomended."
3,1696,"Apr 8 2009 	Not luxurious but excellent for Paharganj	This is not a destination hotel. You wouldn't go to Delhi just to stay there. But if you like Paharganj or at least its convenience for the train station, metro, etc., Metropolis is about as good as it gets. Be sure to request rooms 109, 110, or 111. They are in an entirely different league from all of the others.Paharganj is bustling and virtually none of its hotels are quiet, and this is no exception, but with the a/c running it's manageable.Also, do not ask the front desk to arrange pick-ups, cars, etc. for you as they will charge nearly double what others in Paharganj charge. I bargained them down for one particular trip but I had to start over every time I returned to the front desk to confirm or change the time, with the attendant not believing I had bargained it down with someone else before. There is a travel agency immediately across from the front door of Metropolis that will give you much more reasonable prices for everything."
4,1696,"Jan 15 2009 	Filthy absolutely filthy!	I've been eating at the Metropolis for years, but hadn't stayed there since it used to be a cheap but quality hotel for backpackers back in 1993. The reason I eat there is that it has an alcohol licence (the only place in Parharganj, that i know of), and although a bit expensive for India, the food is good, the beer is chilled and both the downstairs and rooftop restaurant tend to attract a decent crowd. It is a great place to meet people or to have a business lunch.Both the hotel staff and restaurant staff always were, and still are, extremely hospitable, polite and very helpful when it comes to getting tickets confirmed or booked, organising things and so forth. The staff are great.So, it was with this in mind and travelling to Delhi for the first time with my newly acquired wife, i booked in for a double, en suite room room with television.Now, what we got was indeed a room, with a double bed, television, en suite bathroom, AC and a fridge....but the room clearly hadn't been cleaned since I last stayed there in 1993. The fridge was worse than the fridge that my mate Dave used to have in his student house shared with 9 other stoners, and both myself and my wife preferred to stay out of the bathroom. It was a complete horror show. It didn't need cleaning - it was way past that stage - it needed to be completely burnt out and started over again.Having raved about Delhi to my wife, i was quite embarrassed to have taken her there. We only stayed the one night, and unless somthing changes there, given the choice of cheaper and better quality rooms available through Parharganj, i am not likely to stay there again.You will still find me up on the roof top restaurant in the evenings though. Stop by and say hi."
5,1696,"Nov 1 2008	The Best choice !!!	My mate and I stayed here Three times during our time in India, we tried a variety of rooms, ranging from okay too &quot;Top shelf&quot; for the $$$$.. oops Rs.Rooms were all clean, as well as bedding, although the usual Delhi plumbing rumbles from time to time.The Rooftop restaurant had more than a few visits from us, each time sampling something different, with no complaints.Breakfast was always a pleasant experience, not only the food but also the helpfullness of the staff... Very charming, courteous and always willing to help with directions, language translation etc etc.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to any friend or budget traveller looking for a very safe and trustworthy place to stay. Everyone From the Front Reception to the Sharma family management, are exceptionally friendly and proffessional."
6,1696,"Oct 23 2008	Noisy scruffy but a real taste of Delhi	The Metropolis provided a realistic introduction to India for the first-time visitor. The Metropolis is in the maelstrom of the lively market district, with all the colour, noise, dirt, bustle and confusion that that entails. A shock to those used to well-ordered suburbs, but exciting and a real taste of India.Our room was small, scrufffy with temperamental air conditioning, of no character and very noisy - packs of barking dogs as well as the street hubbub! Avoid a room at the front if you can.The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful, and the restaurants - breakfast downstairs, lunch and dinner upstairs - in the open air or under cover upstairs as you chose - provided a variety of excellent food.We survived a week there - it proved a good base for exploring the city and we came to feel at home. Nevertheless, on our return to Delhi for our last nights in India we did chose a more expensive hotel in the south of Delhi to ensure sound sleep, though we did return to enjoy a last lunch at the upstairs restaurant.Given that you don't go to India to experience the anodyne, this hotel is good value."
7,1696,"Aug 8 2008 	Disappointing experience	This was our second stop over in Delhi so we decided to upgrade ourselves from the previous guesthouse in the middle of Pahar Ganj, and chose this hotel based on appearance.Despite booking our stay using the hotel website, and receiving email confirmation, we were annoyed to find the night manager had no knowledge of our reservation when we finally arrived at 01.00 am. However he did manage to find us a room (albeit on the small side, but we were in no position to argue as this was all that was left). Our room was fairly clean but had obviously been well used, and the whole hotel could do with a spruce up and although we were given a discount for the inconvenience at check-in, we did not feel that this booking gave value for money."
8,1696,"Jan 1 2008 	Shabby place	The hotel is well located in Paharganj, a lively quarter in Delhi. The rooms are not very nice, with poor lighting and dirty-looking bathrooms. Our room was even very noisy, as we could hear our neighbor in the bathrooms next door, spitting, toilet noises and the lot. Breakfast was not on the roof but in the hotel lobby. Avoid the pancakes, mine had a terrible taste of egg..."
9,1696,"Nov 21 2007 	Better than reviews	We thought this hotel was the best to the Paranga (main bazzar) region and a little more expensive for good reason. If u want cheap and cheerful then try the Lord Krishna, if not here was good, a/c not noisy, big clean room and sheets and towels. Will do a deal if not busy and airport taxi only 300R, much less than out previous 'budget' (smylee inn - dont go there) hotel that charged 520R for our pick up.Lively and best place to stay in Delhi to experience real city life. Haggle hard, but dont be mean and enjoy the surroundings. plus the metro is just over the road and only 6R to Connaught place."
10,1696,"Apr 11 2007	nice hotel	I've just stayed at this hotel and felt obliged to write a review so you know what you're getting. My friend and I spent quite a while reading reviews of this and other hotels in the mid range of the lonely planet, and there were good and bad reviews for each place, it was difficult to make a choice.The hotel is at the better end of the bazaar, where the street is a bit wider and not as grimy. Its still the bazaar though, so its dirty and busy all the time, so be prepared for that. Our room was a very large room at the top, it was quiet, with AC, a couple of fans, and even a fridge. The room itself was ok, plain with no character, but sheets and walls were clean. The staff were the friendliest that i came across in India, and seemed interested in helping us with advice on various things. We ate at the restaurants upstairs and down, and thought the food was good too. This place is by no means the Ritz, but for Delhi i think its really ok. MY first night in Delhi was spent in a smaller, cheaper hotel in the middle of the bazaar and it was quitre a nasty experience, a tiny room which felt very dirty."
11,1696,"Jan 20 2007 	Overpriced bad location	I stayed at the Metropolis Tourist Home in november 2006 and didn't like the place at all. The rooms are clean, but there are no windows, no hot water and the airconditioning is very loud and doesn't really work. The rooms do have a fan aswell, but I was afraid it would come down from the ceiling and since i was lying underneath it....... The rooftop restaurant is good. But the worst thing about the hotel I found was the location. I thought Paharganj was cramped with hotels and guesthouses. People constantly hassle you. If I would return to Delhi (which I don't think I will) I would stay somewhere in the southern part of town. It is further from all the sightseeing spots, but in a hectic place as Delhi I think the relative calmness of a suburb is a necessarity."
12,1696,"Nov 11 2006	overpriced and overhyped	I have been to the Metropolis tourist home in the Paharganj area since i wanted a mid range place and this one was supposed to be one the best in this category according to Lonely planet.I paid 1400 rs/night(24 euros) for a very mediocre room poorly furnished. There were no amenities at all in the bathroom, there was no hot water most of the time and the shower pressure was really weak.It was impossible to adjust the air con since it was broken.They give you only one sheet(good thing that i had mine) .There was a tiny tv.On the good side, the room was clean and big and the rooftop restaurant is good.Overall i had the feeling that this place was overpriced(2star price for what is really a backpacker guesthouse) and i will probably not come back to this hotel."

2,1698,"Oct 30 2008	Avoid Pablas at all costs!	We arrived at Pablas International around 10pm, dragged all of our luggage into the lobby, and someone named Arif greeted us and asked how our trip was. The hotel lobby was nice and we were happy to finally be there and get checked into our rooms. Then Arif broke the news that he didn't have any rooms for us at Pablas. He said that he had &quot;better&quot; rooms at a hotel down the street called &quot;Ranouk&quot; (I can't get remember the exact name, but it was something like that). I asked why he had us unload our bags from the car if he didn't have rooms for us - how annoying. It became clear that Arif was giving us the run around - he just wanted us to come to the hotel and make sure he didn't lose any commissions. It was late and we didn't have too many options other than to stay down the street - so we loaded our luggage back into the car and went to the other hotel - and boy was it a dive! We found a different hotel the next day. We got a refund from hotels.com and Pablas didn't dispute it. I ran into another unhappy traveler at the &quot;hotel down the street&quot; and he said the same thing happened to him. It looks like a nice enough hotel, but what difference does it make if they don't have a room for you when you make a reservation?"
