70,1894,"Dec 11 2008 	Disappointed	I stayed here for three nights with my sister and my two children for a shopping and sightseeing weekend. The location is excellent, within walking distance of shopping and sightseeing. I found the reception staff awful, we arrived at 3.30 and we're told we' d have to wait until 4pm to check in, which was fine as it was the time stated behind the desk. We decided to have something to eat in the Martinique restaurant where after waiting about 10 minutes for a menu and very shortly after ordering I was presented with a bill!!! the food took forever as apparently the oven switched off, and the pizzas weren't cooked and when the food did arrive it was overcooked, very disappointing. It was 4.45 when we returned to the desk to check in and our room still wasn't ready! We were asked to wait and the staff member was very unhelpful. We waited for a further 15 minutes and eventually had to speak to another staff member. After a short discussion with what seemed to be the manager she beckened us over again and said that she was offering us an executive room due to the fact that our room wasn't ready. The room was adequate but very small. I'd hate to have seen what our original room was like!I found the bell boy staff excellent and very helpful, they restored may faith in the hotel!the Martinique restaurant had lovely food, especially breakfast but sadly the service was terrible, waiters not listening to our orders, arriving with wrong drinks, no tea, butter, side order, etc. There was only four of us so it shouldn't have been that difficult. It was very busy but the service was disappointing. This hotel is in an excellent location and maybe we were just very unlucky with our experience but having to wait so long to check in after travelling from Ireland was unacceptable."
71,1894,"Dec 11 2008 	great hotel and location fab	We arrived at this hotel and on check-in asked for an upgrade as my husband is a Radisson Gold card member. We were upgraded to a suite with free breakfast!!That aside, we found the hotel clean and the staff pleasant, though I think the rooms could do with a bit of a paint! The beds were SOOOOO comfy and the widescreen TV handy for catching up on the news. Air conditioning a bit out of date and noisy, but not anything to complain about.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. One block from Penn railway station and half a block from Macys - cant ask for a better location. Subway route right under hotel.I have stayed all over the place and found this hotel to be very good value."
72,1894,"Nov 24 2008 	Outstanding Service in a great location	Without hesitation I would recommend the Radisson Martinique. For location, it can't be beaten. Right in the heart of downtown Manhattan within a two minute walk of Macy's and Penn Station/Madison Square Garden.The staff were some of the most courteous we had ever encountered. The breakfast was good and plentiful. The food in the restaurant was delicious and moderately priced. Try the seafood pasta - unbelievable!We stayed there just before a cruise from Bayonne. I suggest you use the hotel's Towncar Service, which the concierge will book for you. It was $80 fixed price to the Bayonne cruise terminal. I thought that was great value, and it took away any doubts as to what a taxi might charge. It was also clean and right on time, which is more than I can say for the last NYC 'limo' company we used (see my other reviews.)If you're a golfer then you might be interested to see the plaque outside the entrance commemorating the fact that the USPGA held its first ever meeting at the hotel in 1916. Paul Azinger also named his victorious (boo hoo!!) Ryder Cup team of 2008 at the hotel.Don't listen to me - just try it. You won't be disappointed!!"
73,1894,"Nov 22 2008 	no complaints	Stayed only one night on business but loved what i saw. I had a spacious room (considered a suite possibly) with a king bed, two full baths and a sitting area that was at the entrance of the room. 3 windows overlooking the front of the hotel by the street corner and room service was pricey but good. The entire room was immaculate so not only was i surprised by the size of the room but the 2 full bathrooms was great for us to get ready in and not have to wait for one to finish before the other person got in. The bed was a sleep number bed so i actually got a full night's sleep in a hotel room which is rare. The only down side was that i was on a low floor and the city is awake 24 hours so we did get some street noise from sirens passing by but otherwise the hotel was quiet.Close to where i needed to be in midtown and shopping is right across the way. Great korean bbq rests. down the block too.Will go back again!"
74,1894,"Nov 20 2008	center of it all but off the beaten path	On a recent visit to NYC for a friends bachelor party i had the pleasure of staying at the radisson martinque. The room was small, but when you visit NYC, you shouldnt spend much time there anyway. The rates....hmmm...when i told my friend what we paid, he said 'thats almost free!' We were close to everything, every taxi ride was very inexpensive. We even walked to several of our destinations. It was great walking out the door going a block and looking up at the Empire State Building and down the street at Macy's. Taking Amtrak to the city is the best and the 3 block walk from Penn Station cant be beat! Every doorman and bell hop was helpful friendly and gave NYC a new image... especially Joe Pesci's 'sound' alike, Ronnie. They even taught me that the PGA was formed inside the very building where we stayed. I cant wait to return for more fun!"
75,1894,"Oct 19 2008 	Good hotel in great location	Stayed here for a long week-end in NYC. Great hotel, good service, clean, delicious breakfast and in a perfect location. Walking distance to most stores on 5th avenue, Central Park, Library and Times Square. Very close to a subway station and Macys."
76,1894,"Sep 28 2008 	I love NY and I love this hotel	This hotel is magnificent. Great location. Within walking distance to Macy's and the Empire State Building and many other must see places. There is also a place to board the subway right outside the hotel. The staff is AWESOME, willing to answer any questions or help in any way. Good rooms and beds. Clean. A+++++++++++++++++++++++!!!!!"
77,1894,"Sep 17 2008 	Great location	I had read horror stories about the hotel, the area etc. I was given a GREAT room, 2 hours before check-in time, on the 18th floor, with direct view on the Empire State building. OK the airconditioning IS noisy - so what ? calm down and wear ear plugs at night. Service OK - nothing outstanding but adequate enough. I had made an ONLINE check-in for the hotel room and indeed, my key and everything was ready for me as I arrived. This worked out well for us. The hotel is located just above the subway (orange and yellow line) GRRRREAT for moving around. Accross the road from Macy's. Good restaurant on the ground floor. Overall, a good experience and I appreciate I received a nice large room."
78,1894,"Aug 31 2008 	Highly Recommended!	I stayed at this hotel for a week and after reading some of the previous reviews, I was a bit dubious. I arrived at the hotel at 1.30pm and was served by a friendly lady called Angela. After checking if my room was ready, I was advised to return at 4pm. I returned 15 mins earlier and Angela recognised me advising my room was ready.My room was a lot bigger than I expected, especially as they had offered us a 2 double bed room, when there was only 2 of us staying! We even got a view of Broadway and Speedy's outside! The room was on a high floor so we had no problems with smoking rooms or any safety problems encountered by others. We got 2 bottles of complimentary water on the first day and everything was replaced daily, apart from the first day but a housekeeper came to check and it was replaced within one minute.The reception, concierge and bellhops were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located very centrally, next to a metro stop and also 2 blocks from some fast food chains and shops and also round the corner from Macy's and Empire State Building. There is also a shop called Walgreens which is 2 blocks away, round the corner from Empire State Building, where we purchased many American goodies for a decent price. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant so can't comment, but Speedy's is conveniently across the road. If not, there are lots of other places to eat, Starbucks being on every street in NYC!The only negative was the hotel is opposite some building works, so if you have a room facing that side of the hotel, then beware of some construction work which could wake you up at 7am! But if you're an early riser or can sleep through anything, then you won't have a problem!Overall, I found this hotel to be fantastic, in a great location and I would highly recommend! Don't forget to bring some $1 bills as tipping is everywhere in this city!"
79,1894,"Aug 20 2008 	Adequate problems to look out for....	We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend this August (08) with our two boys (ages 13 &amp; 11). Theres good and bad with this hotel; heres the lowdown:Location  its midtown, one subway stop south of Times Square, which is where we had a lot of activities planned. We also had Central Park and the World Trade Center museum on our list, so this centralized location came in handy for us making it a little easier to plug in some down-time for us and the kids mid-day. Another plus, the subway station for the N, R, &amp; W lines is literally out the hotels front door and to the right.The hotel is on the corner of 32nd and Broadway. 32nd street east from Broadway is Korea Town, which is primarily that one street going out some 3-4 blocks from what we saw. We didnt have time to explore the neighborhood much more than going down 32nd street a ways.The bad with this location is that its midtown address means higher room rates than you can find further out. We had the boys, so the good central location seemed worth the extra dough. After riding the subway extensively for three days however, we realized that it can take you all thru the city with such speed that we think that, absent needs of any kids, one could do better in a hotel further out, say down towards Battery Park, where some new and cheaper hotels are located.Service  The Check In Saga  We had a real problem with this hotel upon our attempt to check in on Friday afternoon. As with most hotels, check in is 4pm. We arrived there early and were told they might be able to get us into the room early. Good thing we didnt count on that because they stalled us till past 5pm, claiming someone else was still in the room, and then, that staff were checking the room. I overheard similar excuses given to other guests and realized they were playing games with us all because they were probably short staffed in housekeeping and way behind getting rooms ready.After giving them over an hour past check-in I announced to the front desk (loudly) that I needed to bring the manager in at this point because me and my family were very disappointed at what was going on. When the desk clerk tried to put me off further with more promises that the room was being checked I said (also loudly) that this ISN'T MOTEL 6 and I didnt expect to see such a problem in a hotel like the Radisson. When the manager noticed some of the other guests theyd managed to delay had heard this and were now heading back his way, he suddenly found that they had a room available that would meet our needs. We found ourselves up on the 17th floor  the Executive Suites floor  which had its own little clubroom with free drinks, snacks and internet for those with rooms on that floor. For those who havent been to NYC before, let me add here that (1) once a hotel has decided to inconvenience you, only effective complaining will get results; (2) hotels in older buildings in the city have smaller, older rooms. The Executive floor room we got was what they considered one of their best rooms  but it wasnt anywhere near as big or as nice as even some lower level rooms in say, a Marriott in the DC area or in Virginia. And (3), if you DO find yourself up on that executive floor, whether by design or luck (as with us), the breakfast served in the executive club room is only a continental spread  the breakfast you probably got free tickets for from your booking is the downstairs buffet which is the full spread with eggs sausage and bacon. Service  Hotel Staff - This was a mixed bag for us. Most of the staff, especially the bell hops and front door people were terrific. We ordered carry-out from the hotels restaurant on more than one occasion and I found the staff I had to deal with there not always willing or happy to help me. On one occasion the guy I was dealing with tried to overcharge me and it took me a bit of back and forth with him to get it straightened out, which I needed like a hole in the head at 10 pm (theyre open 24 hours, which is a rare and good thing). The staff they had working up in that executive club room were for the most part very friendly and helpful with one notable exception  one lady who apparently was having one hell of a bad week.Cost  We booked with this hotel thru a package on Expedia.com  getting us the optimal set up for our long weekend. I think the room came up to around $360 or so a night, which we found similar to comparable chain hotels in that area. We chose to stay at a chain rather than an independent. Room service and restaurant costs were on a par with that part of the city.So if you're traveling, particularly with kids, this isn't a bad hotel for a short stay, but just be prepared to go to bat for yourself if you encounter any problems!"
80,1894,"Aug 19 2008 	Great Budget Hotel	My family vacationed in New York for the first time in late July. This was a wonderful hotel for the price. The staff (especially the bellhops) were very kind and helpful. The standard room was clean; comfortable beds w/ goose down comforters and pillows. We had a small problem w/ the AC unit when we first arrived, but it was repaired immediately. Hotel lobby is very nice. The hotel restaurant is nice, but the food is only so-so. The hotel is centrally located, (1) block from the Empire State Building and (2) blocks from Macy's and other name brand stores. There is a drug store located next to the hotel and the subway is out the front door. We had a wonderful time and would stay in this hotel again!"
81,1894,"Aug 18 2008 	Robbed at the Radisson Martinique NYC	I stayed at the Radisson Martinique for 5 days/4 nights for a conference August 13 - 17, 2008. I entered my room a little after 3 pm and within the first hour, an employee entered my locked room and upon seeing my husband and I, said &quot;sorry...just checking&quot; and hastily left. I was aghast. My husband laid down to nap and shortly after, a second employee entered my room and said exactly the same thing as the first and hurriedly shut the door and left.I laid down to nap with my husband around 5:30 pm and was awoken by a phone call at 9 pm by my daughter saying some women had just called our house in upstate NY saying she had found my purse. I could not believe it. I have no doubt my purse was in my room with me before I fell asleep as I sat and put my receipts in my wallet and purse while my husband slept.I also put my cell phone on the floor by my bed so I would hear when our NYC friend called to meet up with us. That was also taken. Someone entered our room while we slept and removed these items!It was quite nerve-wracking to know that not only did someone enter my room (AGAIN!), they were right by my head while I was sleeping...what would/could have happened if one of us awoke? o_0Hotel security was of no help. The Front Desk manager(s) were of no help. They would not call the police for me and made me find and walk to the nearest precinct. The Manhattan MIdtown South Precinct wanted to know why I did not call 911 to report the robbery and I told them the Radission said I could not and had to walk down to the Precinct. The Police told me they were well aware of the Raddision Martinique management being obnoxious in this way and not wanting the police in their lobby to reflect poorly on the other guest. I found this to be outrageous. When I confronted the head of security about this, he stated that it was not an emergency so I could not use 911 regardless of what the police told me. For real.The conference meeting planner made the hotel give me a new room with a lot of arguing as they did not want to. One the last day there, I received a call from security that my purse had been found outside the door to my NEW room.Security refused to discuss the investigation with my or why two of their employees would try to enter my room without knocking or anything. They would not give me a printout of the information for my company...nothing.My personal feeling is that it was definitely an &quot;inside&quot; job and the hotel will do anything to just shut you up till you go away. They don't want to hear anything that reflects badly on them. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone but if you do stay there, I wish you luck."
82,1894,Aug 15 2008 	A Great Deal in A Fantastic Location	I live in the NYC area but occasionally need to stay over in the City for business. I have many choices but this hotel is perfectly situated and frankly can not be beat as far as the quality for cost. You can do FAR worse for price and still not be in such a great area with a subway entrance at the door of the hotel.
83,1894,"Aug 13 2008 	The Big Apple	Just back from four nights in the Big Apple. Stayed in this Radisson. Staff were very courteous and helpful. Room was clean and tastefully decorated although bathroom was on the small side. The hotel is right beside the Empire State building and Macys department store and is in a safe neighbourhood. Arriving at JFK, we took a yellow cab to the hotel. The flat rate in $50 to anywhere in Manhattan. They also have minibuses that service the hotels that cost $19 per person but the journey is long and tedious, stopping at various hotels along the way. We got a got a good rate from hotels.com that did not include breakfast but there are delis and cafes all over the place. Speedys opposite the hotel was excellent that priced your food per weight on plate!. There is also a delightful small park right beside hotel which offers refuge from the heat and a nice way to have your breakfast and/or coffee alfresco. Beware of the tipping epidemic in New York. They all expect it and some restaurants even include it in the bill. Don't be intimidated by it. Only tip for good service. This was our motto so the rude taxi driver lost out etc. For the big attractions go early. We were on the ferry to the Statue of Liberty at 8:30am, otherwise tickets sell out by afternoon. Buy a Grayline ticket for the sighseeing open topped bus. This really gives you a feel for the city and gets you to the main attractions. You can hop on and off all day. I would stay here again in New York and would recommend it to friends. Overall a brilliant city break."
84,1894,"Aug 11 2008 	Housekeeping......	I spent a few days in this hotel in New York.My room was on the 15th floor. the room was pleasant. Two king-size beds, spacious room. Nice bathroom, with the things you need. Not spectacular. But wich bathroom in the USA is spectacular, when you have a standardroom??Location of this hotel is excellent. You walk out the hotel and the famous shops are surrounding you. Good place.Lobby is small. A pianist welcomes you. Litlle shop.Taking the elevator takes quiet a long time. Friendly staff. but....housekeeping problems:My bathroom was not clean. I found hair ont the wall, and the bathtub. And that;s the most dirtiest a traveller can find.The wastebin was not emptied as well.Cause I had a flight back to the Netherlands late in the evening, I wanted to sleep a few hours by day.But than there is housekeeping: smashing doors, vaccuumcleaner hitting your door constantly, and shouting at eachother. When there is a : Don't disturbe sign on the door, that mean, please silence. I do understand that housekeeping-emplyees have to do there work, and sometimes that makes noise, but the way I experienced here in this hotel. It was to much.I asked to be a little more silence but I was not succesfull!Please members of the housekeeping: respect the signs on the door, your guests will appreciate this.I do hope that the staff of the hotel do read this view as well, so they know what guests experienced."
85,1894,"Aug 8 2008 	Great Location Very Good Hotel!	Family Friends booked this hotel for us. We are a family of 5. When our friends first checked in they only received one room and it wasn't the best from what I understand. They moved them and gave them the second room. Their room was nice and had a good layout for the room. Our room had two double beds and the kids are small enough (11, 8, 7) to still to fit all three on a double bed if arranged right. As a family of five, we quickly take up space, but we had plenty of room to take care of the four S. Sleep, shower, shave, and I will let you figure out the last S. After a long day of touring new york, watching the today show live, and going to mets and yankees games, the beds enabled us to recharge our batteries with a good night's sleep. The hotel is in the perfect location. We took amtrak to new york so it was an easy stroll to and from union station. There is a subway station right out side the hotel. For the most part the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Would i take my family there again, Yes and hope to next year when the new stadiums open."
86,1894,"Jul 30 2008 	Good solid chain hotel	Arrived late at the hotel but was checked in quickly to a room on the 7th floor. I stayed two nights, and the staff were polite and helpful throughout.Room was very spacious by NY standards with a large bed and sofa/table. The bathroom was fairly dated but clean enough, and shower was excellent. Slight niggles were the auto-pay minibar (I hate these) and the lack of a safe in the room.The best thing about this hotel is it's location. You can easily walk to Central Park, Soho, meatpacking district etc in 15-20 minutes, and it's right on a subway stop.Overall, this is by no means a luxary hotel, but the prices are ok for NY, and it's fantastic location means it's a great choice for enjoying this amazing city."
87,1894,"Jul 29 2008 	We will definitely return!	Let me be very clear... I gave our hotel experience an excellent rating based on the fact that we locked in a $175.00/night rate (I'll get to that in a moment). The service was great from arrival, our room was clean and even had a view of 32nd &amp; Broadway. There is a subway entrance right outside the hotel which is so convenient. Right around the block you'll find Macy's and tons of other amazing shopping. Now back to the price. If you are still wondering how we got such a great deal, here's the secret...Radisson's Best Price Guarantee!!! Here's how you do it...find the lowest online rate, then book the room through Radisson.com, submit a claim form (found on the website) within 24 hours and once they verify the lower rate, they will match it minus 25%. Not only do you get the best deal, but you also don't have to pay up front. It's the way to go. That said, had we paid full price, I would have higher expectations so I can see why there are some poor reviews. I guarantee if you lock in a decent rate, you will be as pleased as we were with our overall experience."
88,1894,"Jul 28 2008 	Would have been higher score but had some issues	We booked this because we got a good price for our stay of 3 nights and they said they offered internet access. Well, our first night there I went to download pictures we had taken that day and could not access the internet. When I called they suggested we come and get a bridge to help with the signal. That was done and we still had no service (funny thing is I could get service for everywhere else around, including the hotel next door, but they required a cc to use it). Called again and they gave me a number for the internet help desk...that was a pointless waste of minutes on our cellphone(didn't use the room because it was .50/min for toll free calls) and still nothing. We had sporadic if the laptop was in teh right place at the right time, or if I wanted to sit in the lobby. They only kept saying that they are working on getting fixed so all can use it. The other problem was the breakfast buffet. We decided to eat at the hotel our last morning before checking out. Buffet was $15 and I have had better and bigger ones for less money. Service was bad, food was mediocre and all it was was a glorified continental breakfast (eaten simlar at super 8/Best Western for free). May stay here again, but will verify internet is working in all rooms and will not eat meals there."
89,1894,"Jul 25 2008 	Great Stay	We arrived early on Saturday July 19th, knowing that our room would not be ready we check our bags with the bellhop and went off to see a matine on Broadway. When we returned there was a very short wait for check-in, the front desk staff was great and very pleasant. We signed-up for the free gold points rewards program during our check-in and we were given a free upgrade to a king executive room. What a great way to start our vacation. The upgrade also gave us access to the Martinique Club, which provided a free continental breakfast each morning and a cocktail and appetizer buffet each evening. Housekeeping was great and kept our room nice and clean, even brought up extra towels right on request and they were even still warm from the dryer. I will stay at this hotel every time I visit NYC, it is very close to the subway and within walking distance to Times Square and the Theatre District. We checked out on Tuesday July 22nd and again the bellhop held our bags during the day as we had an evening flight. Great time at the Martinique definitely will be back."
90,1894,"Jul 17 2008 	At the right rate the Radisson is Great!	We chose to stay at the Radisson based on price and location. Radisson has a lowest rate guarantee policy - if you find a lower rate anywhere on-line they will match it minus 25%! We found a cheaper rate on Hotels.com and after submitting the information to the Radisson - they guarnteed our room at the lower rate - which was a fantastic rate for a hotel in New York City. The location is good - it is centrally located and very close to Macy's and the Empire State Building. It also has easy Subway access which we used alot during our stay in the city. The rooms and bathrooms are small but functional. We didn't plan on spending alot of time in our room, so they were okay with us.The bellhop service was excellent. We were traveling with another couple and the bellhop was excellent in unloading and sorting our many bags. They also held our bags for us after checkout so we could finish our touring of the city without having to worry about our luggage.When I wrote this review the Trip Advisor rate for the Radisson was $444/night - I wouldn't classify the Radisson as a $400 hotel. but it is an excellent value for around $200/night. Overall we had a great stay at the Radisson!"
91,1894,"Jun 29 2008 	Great location Great Service Good Hotel	I stayed in &quot;penthouse room&quot; last week and overall very satisfied. The RoomThe room was large from a NY perspective; it had a bedroom, bathroom, but also a separate section for desk and a large closet. The Sleep Number bed was great, the cleaning standards very good and the bath room in good condition. Two complaint though; 1) the hotel has a wireless network rather than a cabled solution for guest room Internet access. In my room (maybe because it was on top and in a corner) had a very poor, on again off again, access. 2) Small issue, but easy to fix, the bathroom door opened in, which forced you to navigate around a very tight space to get it closed.The ServiceCleaning was very good, room service was quick, the front desk new what they were doing and were very accommodating. A guest services representative checked in to see that all was fine towards the end of the stay (nice touch, but would have made more sense to contact guests earlier in their stays). The complimentary breakfast served on the 17th floor was more than adequate. All in all very good serviceThe Location32nd and Broadway. 12 blocks or so from Time Square, a few avenues from Madison Square Garden. Great location for tourists."
92,1894,"Jun 26 2008 	Glad the Reviews on this hotel were wrong!	I have just returned from New York after a 6 night stay at the Raddisson with my other half and have to confess I was relieved not to have any of the experiences I had read about in other reviews! We arrived before our room was ready but that was not a problem, our bags were sorted out by Mike at the porters desk who was really helpful and nice, all the staff we encountered were. The room itself overlooked the Empire State Building which really made us realise that yes we were in the big apple! the room wasn't massive but I would not describe it as small either, we were on the 14th floor. The bathroom was small but there was enough space for us, most hotel bath rooms from my experience are small in any event. We had requested a none smoking room and that is exactly what we got, I have chest problems and we emailed expedia after reading some of the reviews to ensure that we would get a no smoking room and they emailed the manager at the hotel who ensured them that the room would be no smoking.The location of the hotel is great, two blocks from Macy's, the Empire State Building is also just around the corner and Times Square is no more than a 5 minute walk away. We didn't eat in the hotel restaraunt which is located next door, it looked nice but we found so many nice places to eat in the area, the hotel is very convieniently situated for sightseeing, shopping, everthing really. The subway is relatively easy to use once you have figured out which way you are travelling. The only thing that we wanted to see which was some distance away was the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island but again this can be accessed via the subway.The hotel arranged for a car to take us from the hotel to the airport the day we were leaving to continue our trip in Boston, Rebecca on the Concierge desk sorted all of this and again was very helpful and lovely to deal with,I would stay here again, it was value for money, conveniently located and just what we wanted."
93,1894,"Jun 17 2008 	Very Good Hotel	Stayed at Martinique for 3 nights. I booked with expedia and got a very good deal. It was cheaper than booking direct with hotel and airline websites.No problem checking in and the room was fantastic.The hotel does not have single rooms so it was one of the 1 to 2 people rooms it had a view of Broadway.It was on the 16th floor and was very clean and well fitted out, it had a writing desk and armchair and reading lamp.I have read some of the other reviews and from my point of view the bathrooms are a little small but no problems.The hotel has 3 lifts at the front of the hotel and 2 more at the rear so no problems as some people have mentioned the lifts in reviews.Did not use the mini-bar there is no need on the corridors there are vending machines and soft drinks are $1.25.The air conditioning in the room I was in worked OK.Very convenient position in Midtown, I would go again with expedia and choose this hotel."
94,1894,"Jun 9 2008 	Not horrible but had some problems	Booked a weekend trip to NYC and stayed at this hotel due to location and reasonable price. Unfortunately, our first experience with the hotel was not as good as expected. I arrived early and checked in, but as I expected, my room was not ready. That's fine. We left our bags and did some siteseeing. Returned hot and tired about 2:30. Had quite a long wait to check in again, over a half hour. Finally got our room and went up only to find someone else was in it. So back down we go and the woman at the front desk argued with me that I was the only one assigned to that room and no one was in it. I insisted there was. This went on for some time until the manager got involved. He gave us free drink coupons and told us to go to the bar until he could resolve it. Not really what I wanted to hear at this point - just wanted my room. After about an hour and a half total, the manager gave us a new room right next door. Just left us in a rather bad mood at the beginning of our trip.As for the hotel itself, okay, but not as nicely maintained as I expected. Our room was VERY small. Not much room to even walk around in. The bathroom also very small and hard to maneuver in. The room was fairly clean, but in need of some repair. The bed linens were stained and the sheets very hard and scratchy. Not the most comfortable bed I've been in. The Cafe Martininque, their inhouse restraurant was okay. Very small and, again, in need of a little updating and repair, but the food was not bad. The location is very convenient to the Times Square area and the subway is right outside the door, so it's easy to get around. Just 2 blocks from Penn Station. Overall, good location, but not impressed with the room or the service we received."
95,1894,May 31 2008 	great hotel	we stayed here 24th may -28th may we had a great time the hotel staff were really helpful and friendly. the location was great so near to so many attractions macys just round the corner empire state building 10 mins walk away every thing else 5th avenue about a 25 min walk . we used the subway which was just out side the hotel the hotel helped adviserd us how to get about on the subway. the bedroom was a little small as was the bathroom but really you are not in your room much as there is so much to see and do in new york . i would recomend this hotel as the price was really good.
96,1894,"May 30 2008 	Great Time	At first when I had booked through Expedia, the Raddison Martinique was not available, so i booked the Hotel Pennsylvania.However after reading and seeing various reports about the Penn, I decided to ring Expedia and change the booking to the RRaddison which was now available, although Expedia charged me 85 to change the booking.From what I saw of the Penn when I was in NY 22nd May to 28th May, I am glad i paid the extra to change.From what I saw you cannot compare the two.I suppose there is a good reason why so many flight crews stay at the raddisonwe got to the hotel at 12.30pm and only had to wait until 1pm to get into the room, 14th floor no smoking and no smell of smoke, air con was fine could turn on or off, bathroom small, but I don't know about you but i did not go to NY to sit in the bathroom.Location fantastic, in 2007 I stayed at the Roosevelt, which is a better hotel but you are closer to everything at the raddison.Staff very pleasant, room cleaned every day and big enough for two, location great. Overall really very good, i am going back next year and will be booking again"
97,1894,"May 22 2008 	Marvellous Martinique	I just love the Martinique, location is Excellent just around the corner from Macys, Victoria's Secrets and many more shops. Reception staff are very friendly. Number bed is great fun my daughter slept like a log once she got the perfect number setting. Bathroom is very small this is the norm for NY. Security on the door gives peace of mind at nights and they are very hot. Would not recommend upgrading to the Club Level as it is not value for money with so many eateries around get out and about. Have stayed in many hotels in NY, will continue now to use this hotel as it is good value for money, leaving more in the pocket for shopping. If you are going to NY for a special occassion do not forget the revolving restaurant in the Marquis Hotel. Shopping - Woodbury Common is a must, also a visit to Century 21 at World Trade Centre is worth a visit."
98,1894,"May 21 2008 	Great location but have stayed in better hotels	The good - the midtown location is great and I got a very good deal via expedia. If this is the best deal on offer at the time, go for it. New York hotels are very expensive and the rate on the hotel's website was much higher than what I paid, so always check expedia or similar sites before you book this via their website.There was free wireless internet which worked very well in my room. I have read some reports of the connection being weak or inexistent, so maybe it depends on the floor - I was on the 3rd floor.The bad - my &quot;non smoking&quot; room smelt of smoke. The air conditioner was very noisy, and the sound proofing was inexistent in my room. There was a filthy pyjamas bottom under the bed which looked like it had not been vaccumed for a while. Was not impressed with the service at the front desk.Tips - there's a Speedy's opposite the hotel which has great buffet meals. Don't waste your money eating at the hotel, there are so many eateries in the neighbouring area. Macy's is very close by but Manhattan Mall is even closer, which is a great option if you're on a budget."
99,1894,"May 14 2008 	A Nice Place to Rest Your Head	I went to New York on my honeymoon and booked the Radisson based on okay reviews. We were looking for something that was clean, half-way decent, and not super expensive. And that is exactly what we got. I booked an executive room on the hotel website for $474 a night. I took advantage of the Radisson Online Rate Guarantee and ended up getting the room for only $266 a night!!! The hotel is not an extremely nice hotel with lots of amentities. It is a nice place to rest after a long day of walking around New York. I would stay here again if I could get the same rate. If you are looking for luxury, DO NOT stay here. The concierge Rebecca was very helpful and nice. The bellman Ronnie was also very nice. He gave us a coupon to Jack Dempsey's Irish Pub (located only a block away). We ate there 3 times during our trip. Very good food! The hotel restaurant is good but the service is terrible. We ate there twice and had bad service both times. Definately take advantage of the subway located right outside the hotel door. If you are intimidated by the subway system (which we were), take the time to learn it. It is very beneficial and will allow you to get around the city MUCH faster."
100,1894,"May 14 2008	Great Trip to New York stayed Radisson Martinique Hotel - Phil Ireland	Stayed in the Radisson Martinique on Broadway in May 2008. We arrived before 3.00 p.m. on 3rd May 2008 but they had a room ready and we were able to check in immediately. Very helpful gentleman on the desk. My daughter and I booked a double room and it was good, bathroom a bit small. Great location for getting around. Had breakfast in the Hotel most mornings 15 dollars each for the buffet breakfast + tax and service. Housekeeping staff very friendly and did a good job. All other staff in the Hotel were very courteous although some waiting staff not the most helpful. Would stay there again."
101,1894,"May 2 2008 	Rude Staff Charged For Room We Didn't Stay In Called A Liar Mocked By Staff	I can honostly say in the past 13 years I have been travelling at least twice a month and have NEVER BEEN SO THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED by every aspect of this hotel. I was visiting with family and booked 2 sepparate rooms for 2 nights for the 5 of us. We arrived and were told that we were only booked for one room and that there was nothing they could do. There is no way we would have booked one room for 5 people... They proceeded to call me a &quot;liar&quot; AND I QUOTE!!! The hotel manager we were speaking to went around the corner and was mocking what I had said to her in a goofy voice. We confronted her on this and she turned around and started laughing with another hotel clerk. I have never been treated so rudely in my life and because of something that was 100% their fault.We ended up speaking to almost every level of management in the hotel until they finally told us they would not let us stay there at all, let alone our entire family. We left and found on our statement a $657.00 charge to my credit card when we DIDN'T EVEN STAY IN THE HOTEL!! Still working on that, so far they have been no help and I have not received a credit.. WILL NEVER STAY AT ANOTHER RADISSON AGAIN!!!"
102,1894,"May 1 2008 	Great Hotel	New York is expensive. This is a definite compromise. Hotel location is in a perfect location, right by the Subway, Empire State and not too far from Times Square and Broadway Theatres. This has nothing to do with the Hotel, but we made the mistake of booking the Shuttle Service (Super Shuttle) through Expedia, from the Airport to the Hotel. IT IS TERRIBLE. The drivers treated us like cattle, and jibbered away on their mobile phones whilst driving very dangerously (even for New York standards). Avoid if you can. Hotel itself excellent. We originally got a room without a view, that smelt of smoke. We called the Front Desk and they apologised profusely and moved us to a room with a great view. Room very comfortable, only small downside is the sound proofing isn't great. But a minor compromise really. All in all recommended!"
103,1894,"Apr 29 2008 	Radisson Martinique New York City	Stayed for 3 nights, in April , 2008. Great Location, subway practically underneath the hotel, Macy Dept. store is 1/2 bllock away, Empire State Bldg is about couple of blocks.. about 15 minutes walk to Time Square/Broadway Theatres... Located in Korea town with lots of Korean Restaurents, Massage places.Business center with free use of computer for internet. Check in at 4 pm but you can leave the lungages with them if you get there early. Cost about $28-32 taxi fare from LaGuardia.Negatives..would be old hotel with most room has no view, has windows but looking at other windows and cannot see the city or the streets. Weak concierge sevices, located together with gift shop cashier... did not give us the Club Level room (eventhough we booked and paid for as Club Level, citing they have no records) Club Level Rooms are top two floors 15 &amp; 16 has access to snacks and services... Executive levels are nothing more than higher floor 12 and above and no special room or privileges.Having stayed at Radisson Lexington New York City 5 months ago, both are old hotels, noisey at Radisson Lexington with lots of construction in the building, and bathroom is smaller than Radisson Martiniques. Location is much better at Martinuque on Broadaway. Radisson Martinique on Broadway used to be Holiday Inn."
104,1894,"Apr 29 2008	great position	we booked this medium priced hotel through expedia as a package including virgin flights. its in a great position, a 2 minute walk to macy's and the back looks over (under!) the empire state building which is about a 10 minute walk. the staff were really nice and helpful (as we found everybody in new york). its got a grand entrance and marble everywhere. the bar and restaurant are good. we had breakfast there the first day, but wouldn't bother again - it was pricey and not very good. the rooms were fine - clean, well furnished, a bit on the small side as were the bathrooms.(however we were not in it very much - too much to see and do!) there was a good hairdryer and iron and full sized ironing board. the only complaint we had, was that our room had no natural daylight (706) as it looked straight out to a brick wall. i would check to see where your room is. unlike one of the other reviews, we asked if we could keep our room longer than the 11am time and were told it would cost 50 dollars. i would still recommend this for a short stay, definitely."
105,1894,"Apr 22 2008 	Great Location All Round Good Choice	We stayed at the Radisson Martinique from 4th - 10th April. I used the price promise offer on their website which stated they would match any price quoted on other sites and give an extra 25% discount. I booked direct, and then quoted the better price which was listed on Hotels.com and received an email accepting my claim and confirming a rate of $207 per night, less than half the price offered by the hotels website! Now for the hotel, I am not sure about the negative reviews of this hotel as I can only speak of our experience which was on the whole very good. Our room was big enough to accommodate myself, my wife and our 12 yr old son, with two double beds, en-suite and all other comforts you would expect. The decor throughout the hotel was very good with obvious on-going touch-ups being carried out. A buffet breakfast was available in the restaurant, offering a good choice of hot and cold options for $15 for adults and $7 for children under 11. The location of the hotel is excellent; being only 10 blocks from Times Square, across the road from Macys and with a subway station on the corner of the street, access to the whole city was simple. There was also a good selection of bars and restaurants around Penn Station which was 2 blocks west of the hotel. All-in-all I would recommend this hotel, providing you can secure a deal on the price."
106,1894,"Apr 18 2008	Great place to stay	Had read a few reviews before travel and was a bit concerned but this hotel was great. Very central-1 subway stop from Times Square- station right outside hotel- very easy and safe to use( get day passes for $7 and you can hop on and off all day - great value) Rooms exactly as shown on web site - very clean, loads of clean towels everyday, complimentary toileteries and beds changed even though only there for 3 nights and you can adjust the firmness of your mattress to suit yourself. Very friendly and helpful staff . Next street to Empire State and very nice area. No problems at all - would stay here again &amp; recommend it to anyone. You must visit the cocktail lounge on top floor of Marriott hotel in Times square - revolving room with 360 degree view of Manhattan and FAB champagne coctails- not too expensive and a real treat."
107,1894,"Apr 16 2008	loved our stay	This was our first trip to New York and we cannot say enough for the hotel, our first experience was the bellhop notifying us about the Martinuque club on the 17th floor which was a wonderfull experience for light snack. We were four in the room and after reading some ot the reviews was a little apprehensive about what we would find, however it worked out fine for us.The towels and bedding were wonderfull and our highlite was doorman Ronnie? he was a delight, we would come back. subway stn right next door and within walking distance to every thing.M&amp;M from Chilliwack Canada"
108,1894,"Apr 13 2008 	Much better than we were expecting !	Just returned from a 6 night stay @ the Radisson. Booked through the hotel directly without having to pre-pay for our room. There were 2 adults &amp; 2 children 11 &amp; 8. From the moment we arrived at the front door, we were treated like true guests, the only problem we encounted was on checking the room size on arrival,but this was quickly overcome by a fellow airline crew guest who stays regularly, he advised us in the lift after inspecting our first room allocated, that we should request a room on any floor ending in a &quot;9&quot;.So as instructed requested this room at the front desk and was very pleased with the size of the room and particualry the bathroom. The room was on the 16th floor so no smell of any heavy smoke and air con/heat worked fine. The breakfast was fantastic in the hotel and after some discussion with the front desk our children were included as complimentary also. Each person of the Radisson staff we encountered were friendly, professional and very customer service driven and all spoke English. Overall it was a great hotel experience in a great location for our first trip to the fantastic New York City."
109,1894,"Apr 8 2008	Don't Believe Everything You Read	Just returned from a 6 night stay @ the Radisson. Booked through Quikbook without having to pre-pay for our room. There were 2 adults &amp; 2 teenagers (boy &amp; girl). From the moment we arrived at the front door after surviving our first NYC taxi experience, we were treated like royalty. I was very hesistant about the hotel after reading many negative reviews, most which had to do with a heavy smoke smell (which for non-smokers is a nightmare)After a suggestion from a fellow TA, I called the hotel the day before arriving to make our concerns known that we wanted to be as far away from the &quot;smoking floor&quot; as possible. We arrived many, many hours before the &quot;official&quot; check-in time and were told that if we wanted to leave our bags &amp; go exploring, they would call our cell as soon as the room was ready, which they did . We were able to check-in 4 hours early which worked out great for us . We had dinner reservations before our Broadway show which allowed us to change . There is much truth in regards to the size of the hotel rooms in New York, for 4 people, our room was very small compared to what we have been use to when traveling but we were assured we would only be in there to sleep and that is the absolute truth! Each staff peson of the Radisson we encountered were friendly, professional and very customer service driven and all spoke English which was a blessing being from Tennessee.We never smelled smoke and the rooms were very clean. The biggest surprise upon arriving at check-in was that we did not have to leave a daily $50.00 deposit which freed up extra cash for shopping. Sorry this is so lengthy, but overall it was a great hotel experience in a great location for our first trip to the amazing New York City, our first, but certainly not last trip there. By the way, our room for 6 nights with tax was $1825.00. Thanks for letting me share."
110,1894,"Apr 6 2008 	Location location  location!	We stayed on the club level in an exec room with our two kids. Room size was on the wrong side of ample but in NY you are out and about so this was not really a problem. The hotel is situated on Broadway very close to the Empire State building and Macy's store and has a subway on the corner. The staff were very friendly and couldn't of been more help. The hotel is undergoing some renovation and it has to be said it does need it, so don't expect a glitzy NY establishment but I had no faults with it overall.One thing, if you buying NY tat, don't buy from the hotel shops even with the discount - there are plenty of others round about and if you have kids this is part of the NY experience.The cafe/restaurant is good and is open to the public. It is always busy which speaks for itsfelf so if you are arriving from a long trip eat there and save your legs for the next day."
111,1894,"Apr 1 2008 	Just OK	We spent three nights here. I would say the room was OK, for those not staying long, but it was a little small if you wanted to open more than one suitcase. The location was good, a subway stop was right outside the front door, and the Empire State building was around the block. For our needs, which was seeing the sights, the location worked well. I was not impressed with the desk staff, but this was a very busy hotel, so perhaps that goes with the territory. We tried to check in early, but that was a no go. We were allowed to upgrade our room (the room cost changed, of course) when we finally tried to check in (at 4:10) and were told it would take about 45 minutes to get the people out of the room and get the room cleaned. About 1.5 hours later, we finally got a key to the room. For the price I paid, I wasn't terribly impressed. There was a safe in the room, but I would have had to pay to use it each day. But, perhaps that is typical for New York, I don't know. Would I stay there again - only if they had a really outstanding special. Otherwise, I'd find another place."
112,1894,"Mar 31 2008	Good location but don't bother with the 'superior' room	Located in Korea Way, this hotel is ideally situated for most things and is reasonably inexpensive. Expedia gives it a 3.5 star rating which I think is pushing it a bit.The superior room is adequately furnished, but in ours the fridge didn't work and the air con was very noisy. It included breakfast in their upstairs 'club room' but this was pretty pitiful - only one waitress to cope with everything from taking room numbers to cleaning dishes. Every time we went up there something was missing, from cups to plates, to hot water to some food items. We went early and late, but the timing made no difference - basically there was a lack of staff and equipment to operate efficiently - not even a bin for teabags/cereal packets!Our children had a standard room, which was pretty much the same as the superior room, just didn't include breakfast. This was no great loss! The staff were courteous, but not very knowledgable.Overall, the hotel decor is pretty tired looking, but I would go there again if I wanted a reasonably central hotel on a budget."
113,1894,"Mar 30 2008 	Run don't walk away from this hotel...	Worst hotel ever -- the Radisson appears to be an average three star New York hotel. I paid nearly $400 to stay at the Radisson Martinique on Broadway and thus was expecting a pleasant experience. The hotel is located in Koreatown and is a short walk (less than a block) away from the Empire State Building and Macys. The lobby is nice, but that is the ONLY nice thing I can say about this hotel. My room was clean but every single electronic device in the room was broken! The television made this loud flicker sound every 60 seconds, the thermostat was broken and thus I had no heat, (it was March and it was COLD) the telephone didnt work and the complimentary Wifi had such a poor signal that it was unusable. In addition, the Sleep Number bed was broken and half the bed remained hard as a rock despite my attempt to soften it with the stupid remote control and the large mini bar was empty except for a can of iced tea, a can of orange juice and a can of beerall warm of course.  I was traveling on business and had a really important email to send, so when I realized the Wifi didnt work I called the front desk to ask about the problem and they said they couldnt help and that I should go to the Business Center. So I packed my laptop up and headed to the Business Center. The Business Center was packed with people. I went to the counter to ask for assistance and the guy told me that he wasnt affiliated with the Business Center (even though he was the only employee in the tiny room) and that they Business Center was comprised only of the three computers along the wall. However, I observed these three computers were currently being used by three 12 year old boys playing games on the internet. Maybe its just me, but I think the Business Center should be reserved for Business Guests. Anyway, I told the guy behind the counter that the Wifi in my room didnt work and he told me to tell the front desk. The problem is that there were about 20 people in line to check in at the front desk. So I went back upstairs to call the front desk and tried to tell them what was going on. When she answered the phone I could hear in her voice that she was quite annoyed I kept calling. I was pretty frustrated by this point too and asked to talk to the hotel manager and guess what, they hotel operator HUNG UP ON ME!! Either that or the broken hotel phone disconnected me. I am not sure which. I ended up across the street at some shady internet caf so that I could do my work. I will never, ever stay at another Radisson. Ever."
114,1894,Mar 24 2008	Ok Blame New York	Hotel is clean. However the rooms are small and the lifts are a joke in this day and age. However for new york not a bad deal. We enjoyed our stay.
115,1894,"Mar 17 2008 	Be warned	I travel the World on business and I have to say that this is the worst hotel I have stayed in who advertise executive floor rooms and lounge. Unfortunately I stayed there twice in a week March 2008. They advertise free Wi-Fi but the signal is almost non-existent. When you complain to the front desk they give you a booster kit which is next to useless. Two signs then appeared at the lounge saying they where upgrading their communications system! I was told that the signs get put out periodically when the complaints get too much. The signs I am told have been appearing for over a year. Each day I had to have the room key reactivated, but when you go to the front desk there is an air of we know. If you want to take advantage of the free breakfast, cocktails and horsdouvres you need to be there within the first twenty minutes or there will be no food or plates left. The choice is also pathetic. One word that I need to say is dont blame the ladies who are trying their best to run the lounge. Their job is to satisfy the masses with three loafs and five fishes. The hotel should realise that without these people they would probably have rioting guests. You have been warned!"
116,1894,"Mar 13 2008 	VERY nice stay!	I was VERY hesitant to stay at this hotel after the reviews, just goes to show how different our experiences can be.My original reservation was made through Hotels.com at a VERY good rate for an executive room. My plans were then changed and I need to add an additional 4 nites to the orig. 2. The hotel honored my rate from Hotels.com, which they did not have to do and I was able to stay in my FABULOUS room! other friends staying at the same time thought I had the best room in the hotel - it was great. Very roomy, (by NYC standards), the Sleep Number bed was great, bathroom although a bit cramped, was CLEAN! Housekeeping was great, the breakfast on the 17th floor was super, the front desk was especially helpful, friendly and efficient!! and the doormen were fun, too! All in all, I had a great stay - thank you Radisson!"
117,1894,"Mar 13 2008 	Good basic Hotel	We visited New York 4th March to 9th March. After a $45 taxi cab ride which is the set price between JFK and Manhattan we arrived at the Radisson. After reading the reviews we were very sceptical but we found the entrance and reception quite bright and welcoming. No smell of smoke or must. All the staff were excellent and very welcoming. Check in was okay but I can imagine when a few people arrive it is slow. We then went to the 'infamously slow' lifts expecting a snails pace speed. We found them fine. I am not sure what other people are judging them by the term &quot;slow&quot; possibly by their own impatience. We were on the 5th floor so the ride was quick. There were three lifts, two working with the middle one having a notice to guests apologising whilst they were being upgraded. I imagine when more people stay at the hotel the lifts have to stop more frequently ten or twenty more seconds extra wait - wow!. I think some people have not seen the speed of the lifts in Las Vegas, now that is slow ! Or perhaps they are judging the speed by the one in the Empire State Building !The room was clean and adequate. I would say on European standards of an average size. It was a queen size bed and very firm and comfy, which we were glad of as we hate softy spongy beds where you sink and roll together. Firmer the better. Bathroom was small but not tiny and shower was good. Plenty of hot water. View was not great and let little light into the room (see pics) but you dont go to NY to stay in your room. It was surprisingly quiet despite being in such a busy location. We heard the odd police siren but no traffic noise and the only noise we did hear occasionally was the &quot;ping&quot; of the lift arriving on our floor. I do agree that the whole hotel could do with decorating and a facelift but it is not as bad as the reviews previous make out. I would imagine there is the odd problem but our stay was fine. We did not try the restaurant downstairs but it was always busy. Oh and the mini-bar. It makes a right racket. So we simply unplugged it during the night and plugged it back in at morning. Ahh, much better.As for the location, it was excellent what more could you want. Macy's across the road two blocks up (bout 5 minutes walk), Times Square about 15 minutes walk or amble as we would do. Central Park was only 25-30 minutes away. Empire state building literally round the back of the block the hotel is situated in. As for food we did not find breakfast that easy to find. There was Speedy's across the road for fast food type breakfast, Cafe Metro and Paks Wholesome food a little up from Macy's. All had good cheap breakfast on offer, tables to sit at but no waitress service. We did go to Andrews Coffee shop, corner of 34th St and 7th Ave back of Macy's to offer a good sit down waitress service. It was pricier than the others but we preferred it. Also worthy of a mention is Ruby Tuesdays on 7th Avenue near Times Square, cafe downstairs and restaurant upstairs. Very good food and service, good price. If you want to splash out then visit Bobby Vans Steakhouse on 50th Street. Our flight was due to leave on the Sunday at 8.40pm so we checked out at 10.30am. We had prepaid our hotel bill on CheapHotels.co.uk to get a good rate so when we checked out there was nothing to pay. We did not even have to pay for the US Paper deliverd each morning. We left our suitcases with the bellboy. They gave us a ticket and put them in a secure room, they also ordered us a car to go to the airport for 3.45pm. On return to hotel after our last wander around our bags were brought to us. (Whilst we were there another couple had done the same thing but one of there bags was missing, not sure whether it turned up as we had left by then.) We gave them a tip and took the car to the airport (cost $55, okay $10 more than a taxi but it was a comfortable ride). I do recommend going with the Radisson if you can get a good deal like we did. Albeit if the reviews scare you off try The New Yorker, that it at the back of Macy's."
118,1894,"Mar 12 2008 	Good basic clean friendly 	We (group of 7) stayed five days on a package from Heathrow. Compared to some other hotels we have stayed at this was pretty good for what we wanted; Location. The staff were very good generally, the bell-hops excellent, luggage and transport no problem! Room was clean if you ignore the fact that it's a busy hotel and not a hospital! Twin beds, aircon (very noisy unit) daily replenishment of bathroom bits and towels etc. Hairdryer and coffee maker. A word here, don't try to make a good cup of tea in it though, it's useless. Coffee, yes, once you learn how to operate it without electrocuting yourself! There were bits of furniture falling off here and there, but overall the room was good for what we paid.The restaurant had a fair selection of food; breakfast was what we were interested in, although why do the yanks annihilate the bacon? It is so overcooked its more like crisps! Try the place opposite corner, serve yourself what you like, they weigh it, and pay. Take out or eat upstairs. Good value!There is a Mall opposite on Broadway we only noticed on the last day! Its very close too to Macys and behind the Empire State. Can walk to theatres although taxi back is best. Can walk to Times Square too.We went up the Rockefeller Building (The Rock) rather, ice skaters and more to see there! Gppd views of NY and Central Park. Have a ride on a Horse &amp; Trap for $40 ($36 &lt;1 hour + his tip he said!) It only takes 20 minutes as they go round the Skating Rink so 1 hour is a marketing ploy. Good though, well worth doing!Back to the Martinique; internet is free  limited to 15 mins or so if busy but handy. They held our luggage safe on last day as checkout by 11am and flight at 5pm! They were great though.TIP: If you have 6 or 7 people in your group then get a Limo from &amp; to JFK as it costs the same as all on a bus! We paid $140 each way  good reliable driver too. All fold  9/10 for this trip!"
119,1894,"Mar 12 2008	Exceed expections	We booked our stay via hotels.com (no complimentary breakfast) due to the great rate we got but with much hesitation due to some very very bad reviews here. Thankfully, the stay was not half as bad as some reviewers claimed. The room was small but clean and the location was EXCELLENT. Macy's is 5 minutes away and the subway station (PATH) is right outside the hotel entrance.Our biggest gripe has to be the free WIFI access. The signal is sooo weak that surfing the net was an arduous and unpleasant experience. We asked for a change of rooms hoping that the signal strength would improve but no luck, still as weak as a kitten.Overall though, I would say that for the price we paid, we are very happy with my stay."
120,1894,"Mar 6 2008 	Average Hotel	I stayed for 5 nights at the end of Feb with my boyfriend, it is our 6th visit to NYC so we know what to except of the hotels in Manhattan. It is very hard to get a decent hotel for a decent price! We paid 235 each through hotels.com which was great. I recently stayed in the Marriott Courtyard on 42nd street which is a fantastic hotel and would highly recomend!The hotel is average but clean and as you are not in your rooms much I would recomend you stay here if you get a good deal. However, as other reviews point out, the hotel does have a really strong smell of smoke but I supe you get used to it! The room keys are also a problem as walking in and out of shops, past the alarms, deactivates them, so on a number of times we were locked out and had to go back down to reception to ask for someone to open our room, which can get a bit annoying after all the walking round the city. Location wise, the hotel is fantastic, 2 blocks from macys and about 10 blocks from times square, also rite next to empire state building.overall, if you get a good price then i would book this hotel, purely based on location."
121,1894,"Mar 6 2008 	Excellent for 1st time visit	Having spent days researching potential hotels for our first visit to NYC, we were very pleased with our final selection.I organise corporate events and incentive travel for a living so have lots of experience in top hotels but unfortunately do not have a personal budget to match this! We did decide to pay extra for the Executive Rooms which were still excellent value for money and well worth the slightly higher room rate. This meant the rooms were large with huge beds and also (the best bit) gave us access to the Martinique Club for basic breakfast - excellent for stocking up for the day's exploration plus take out coffee to sustain us as we set out. This was brilliantly complimented by snacks and free drinks between 5pm and 7pm. Chance to relax in the spacious lounge, re-charge for the evening's adventures and plan for the next day. Don't expect gourmet canapes (think cheese, biscuits and peanuts) but the atmosphere was very chilled and a good contrast to the crazy city.This brings me to the location which was AMAZING. Walking distance to many major sites and access to Penn station meant that the whole city was just a few subway stops away. Shopping, eating, Times Square, Broadway shows, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building all an easy walk away.Agree that the elevators were very slow but the beautiful (but hidden) Renaissance staircase is always an option if you can't wait.We did have an issue with a blocked lavatory which was quickly fixed (first time over) then, when the problem reappeared, we were moved very quickly into a new room. Other staff were helpful although concierge was useful rather than polite and friendly!Decor is tired and bathrooms small but you get what you pay for and in New York this hotel is excellent value for money when you don't spend that much time in the room.HIghly recommended for 1st time visitors who don't expect luxury but do want to be safe and comfortable."
122,1894,"Mar 6 2008 	Presently Surprised	Stayed in the Martinique because I was warned off the Pennslyvania........spent some time in both (as friends were staying there) and they are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Martinique is quiet, even though its in a very busy area of town....location could not be better, across the road from Macy's, staff very curteous and helpful, rooms small but not by European standards, well decorated, very clean and efficient hotel......would definetely recommend and would stay there again......booked thru hotels.com......most of the hotel search engines were about 60% of the price on the hotel official website....two good bar/restaurants within 3 minutes walking distance, Foleys and Jack Dempsey's (near Empire State on W 33rd street, between 5/6 Avenues. Excellent bar/restaurant on 33rd street and 8th Avenue across the road from the 8th Avenue entrance to Madison Square Gardens, called Tir na N'OgN. from Republic of Ireland"
123,1894,"Feb 29 2008	ok	Stayed here for one week in feb.The main thing this place has going for it is its location,it is right on the corner of west 32th st which means macys,5th ave. etc. are only a stones throw away.I was not impressed by the hotel itself,the building is dated inside and our room was small and very basic.This place is like no other Radisson I have seen,the standards are much lower."
124,1894,"Feb 27 2008 	Great 8 Day Stay	I was in NYC for 8 nights on business. I needed to be near Penn Station. The Radisson Martinique on Broadway was close, had good reviews, and was reasonably priced so I booked a room. Check-in was pretty basic. I asked if I could have a room with a view and the receptionist said &quot;no rooms have views&quot; which I thought was surprising. Anyway, I ignored it and carried on.The hotel looks kind of tired and in need of a makeover. It looks lived-in though, which I found it to be during my stay. My room was a good size and really clean. It was also really comfortable and the temperature was great - easy to control with the thermostat. The bed was comfortable and the linen was pretty good. The bathroom was clean and well-equipped. I liked the towels a lot and the toiletries were good. I used the gym/fitness room every day. Yes it is basic, but you get used to it. You're in New York City anyway and seem to burn off calories just by being in the excitement of it all. The treadmills were brilliant and there's a decent, but small, weights room. The facilities only got busy once during my stay. The door staff are great. Concierge was really helpful. I had the door opened for me each time I arrived or departed - with a smile too. A great touch.The hotel guests all seemed to be European couples in their thirties, in town for a few days' shopping. They were mainly British, but there were also Germans and Italians. A lot of airlines put their cabin crew up here. I saw plenty of amusing 'stare-offs' between Finnair and Virgin Atlantic crew in the lobby!Free wi-fi is definitely a great touch but the signal was weak in my room (1205) so was quite unreliable. It worked though, and I also managed to get access to other free networks outside the hotel.The worst thing about the Radisson is the lifts. There are two sets of them but the main set is so slow. One of the three wasn't working when I was there, and the remaining two were so slow.Overall I had a great stay here and would definitely go back. I would also recommend it to others who are going to the city."
125,1894,"Feb 25 2008 	nice hotel	My husband and I stayed in the radisson for our anniversary. I thought this hotel was nice. They gave us a free upgrade which was really nice, concidering we didn't ask for one. The only complaints I have, is that the bathrooms were alittle dirty, there was some mildew in the shower, which needed a good scrubbing. Another thing was that we were on the 8th floor and at 2 o'clock in the morning we could still hear the club downstairs like it was only 1 floor beneath us. Overall it was nice but I would probably stay somewhere else next time around. If you go to expedia you can get a good last minute deal on this hotel. This is one of the reasons we chose it."
126,1894,"Feb 23 2008 	Sooooo Dissapointed!	We booked this hotel off of hotwire, opting for it due to some decent reviews it had received on other sites and it's very central midtown location. The location is all this hotel has going for it. The staff are rude, (not including the doormen) the hotel smells like smoke, the rooms are tiny, and the mattresses uncomfortable. Calling early the morning of our arrival, my husban aranged with the night shift for early check it that was going to cost us 89.00$. We reluctantly agreed as our plane landed at 8:00am and we had no where to go with some of our baggage that we didn't want to leave checked, (laptop, etc.) Upon arrival the attendant at the desk called us liars and accused us of not arranging for check in, didn't have a room available and said the best she might be able to do was 1:30pm. Sitting in the lobby after this disturbing conversation, I heard her give the same shpiel to three more guests who had arranged for early check in. Finally around 1:30 we were given a room only to find that it smelled of stail smoke and was the tiniest room I've ever stayed in at a hotel. The maid didn't vacuum or throw away trash at all during our stay. The breakfast buffet was stale and horrible. By the time we grabbed some pancakes, the syrup on the chafing dish was the consistency of taffy and impossible to chew, the eggs tasting like eggs from three days ago. My advice, go with another hote and save yourself heartache over handing over your money to an undeserving hotel."
127,1894,"Feb 22 2008 	stinks of cigarette smoke	I stayed here for six nights in February.I normally stay in the Pennyslavania Hotel and thought Id try the Radisson as it is in a good location.I am a light smoker and booked a king room through the hotel website but when I entered the room it stank to high heaven of stale smoke.After changing to a no smoking room on a no smoking floor there was not much difference.Maids use a lot of air fresheners but cant disguise the stale smell.Also there is only two small lifts working out of three and it can take ten to fifteen minutes with the queues to get to your floor.Most hotels I have stayed in in New York including the Penn(club rooms) give a complimentary newspaper eg.New York Post but the Radisson charges for them whether you want them or not..All in all there was about 200 usd extra mysterious charges on my bill.I did not eat ,drink or use the overpriced minibar or extortioate safe(5usd a day plus taxes!!.taxes are where it gets very hairy let me tell you) during my stay.This Hotel is a RIP OFF and I wont be back."
128,1894,"Feb 20 2008 	Terrible customer service	The hotel is located in a great location. The hotel manager was extremely rude and literally a liar! I can't believe in this day an age, a manager of a reputable company can blatantly lie. This is another story all together. The hotel itself is in a great location. The room was extremely small for the price, and the air conditioning was not working. They had someone come up and try to fix it, but to no avail, and they didn't offer us any compensation for this. The room also had a bad musty smoky odor, although it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. Overall we were extremely dissatisfied with our room that we left and went down the street a few buildings away to the La Quinta Manhatten and the service was great, and they give you an incredible complimentary breakfast."
129,1894,"Feb 3 2008 	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in	My workplace booked this for me, as I needed somewhere in this particular area for a few meetings before heading onto DC. How I wish they'd picked somewhere else! Right from my arrival, there were problems. My UK bank card doesn't work in a lot of places in the States, so they book / pay with their company card in advance, sending an auth fax to confirm the hotel can take payment from their card.At check in, I'm told I need to pay. Looking confused, I'm told the room was merely reserved, not paid for. After handing over my card to pay for the first night (and not even knowing if payment would be accepted or not), I headed to my room. (Eventually my company told me they had indeed sent the hotel a fax in advance - did they simply not check the fax machine, or throw it away? Who knows. The person from my company informed me that whoever they dealt with on the phone to fix the problem wasn't particularly pleasant, either).The room was tiny, the view was a brick wall with some windows in it, I couldn't control the heating (it was always boiling hot), and the two worst problems: one, the safe wouldn't work, and two, the smell of SMOKE!The room, the floor itself (and all the other floors I checked out) all reeked of a stale smoke odour. Absolutely horrible, especially as I'm a non-smoker. It seemed like every time the (very noisy) air-conditoning radiator / fan thing switched on, the smell of smoke started to blow into your room. I did hit the off switch on this, but it would always come back on.The safe? I had lots of electronic gear with me, and NEED a safe as I'm in and out of the hotel a lot...don't want to carry it with me. Lots of back and forth action commences, with a guy coming up and failing to fix it, then I was moved into another room, then told to wait for the same guy (who failed to show up). Rang the front desk numerous times - eventually he arrives and tells me the safe in the ORIGINAL room is now working. Had to move back downstairs - something like FOUR HOURS were wasted during all of this nonsense.I was there for something like three nights - by the final night, I was having problems breathing properly, I felt out of breath and my throat was killing - presumably because of the endless stench of stale smoke filling the room. I'd been up since 6AM because of work, had to be on a train early the next morning and it was now after 10PM and I was pretty annoyed. Went downstairs, demanded a new room only to be told it was pretty much booked out, &quot;would you like me to spray your room with air freshener&quot;?Surely, that has to be a joke. I persisted, and was told they could take up a dehumidifier. Ok, sure. But...&quot;you can't be in the room when its on, and it'll need to be on for around at least half an hour&quot;.Yep, I was supposed to walk around New York after 10PM at night while they messed around with dehumidifers. I persisted some more - eventually got moved to a new room where I was promised there wouldn't be a smell. Sadly, I wasn't in there long before the smell was back again, and to top it off, the toilet seemed to be stuck flushing and there was only cold water in the shower.My chest still feels a bit wheezy even now. When I mentioned all of this to the hotel I stayed in during my time in DC, the girl at the desk rolled her eyes like she knew all about the problems people have at this hotel. Considering the Radisson is in New York, it must be a pretty bad state of affairs when poor reviews can travel that far.I would never go near this place ever again, and if you're a non-smoker, I *strongly* advise you to look somewhere else."
130,1894,"Feb 1 2008 	Good hotel	I stayed in this hotel with my sister for a recent shopping trip to New York (great to take advantage of the weak US dollar!). I ended up booking this hotel due to it's good reviews and central location and was not disappointed. The rooms are spacious, clean and warm. The location is really good for both walking and getting the subway. It is really close to Macys and there are lots of shops around that area. It is also less than a 10 minute walk to 5th Avenue which we hit pretty much every day.It is not the cheapest hotel, but compared to some of the other hotel prices in New York I think we got good value for money. When you are there for only 5 days, travelling is a waste of precious time. I would stay in this hotel again the next time I hit New York and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a New York Hotel."
131,1894,"Jan 27 2008 	Mediocre at best	This was my second time staying at the Radisson Martinique. I remember going there 4 years ago with a bunch of girlfriends and I think my standards have dramatically improved since then. A friend and I arrived at 1:30 a.m. and waited for what felt like forever to be served by the front desk. We were exhausted and just wanted to go to bed. Finally, we were served and received a complimentary upgrade - - which turned out to be a penthouse room, with two double beds. Great news - or so we thought. We arrived at our room and it was a good size. The hotel has recently gone non-smoking, but the room still had the smoky smell that sticks. I found this disgusting. My major complaint about the room was the lack of heat. We had no control over the thermostat in the room and the end result was me sleeping with a sweater and my winter coat (fur hood and all) for the night. We made an attempt to correct this the next day and an &quot;engineer&quot; came to take a look. He promised it would be better, but it was only marginally better. We called for the &quot;engineer again&quot; and finally we had some success. That was short lived (one night), because on our last night the temperature dipped again. When you're in NYC to shop, tour, etc. you need to be well rested - - we were no where near well rested. The telephone in our main room also didn't work - - it did when we arrived, but then on days 2-4 it didn't?? Not sure why. On PH1 level there was a private breakfast set up (continental) for certain guests. The woman who worked there was very unfriendly and had no time of day for us when we asked questions about the breakfast - - clearly we were unwelcome despite the fact we also were PH guests! Finally the concierge was never reachable on the phone. It required a trip down to the gift shop (18 floors), which wasn't always convenient. I've been to far superior hotels than this property. On the positive side - - it is in a good location - - very close to Times Square, Macy's etc. And the price could be right - - depending on your standards."
132,1894,Jan 25 2008 	nice Hotel	This was our 1st trip to New York and we liked staying here. It was nice seeing the Raddison as soon as we came out of Penn Station. The rooms were small but clean. Everyone there were very nice to us.
133,1894,Jan 21 2008 	Great Hotel and Location	I just arrived home from New York City after spending two nights at the Radisson Martinque. Great Hotel and Location. Only negative thing about my stay was check in. I arrived in New York early on Saturday morning and the hotel has a 4pm check in policy. I arrived at the hotel and decided to check in case there was any chance of getting in that early and there wasn't so we checked our bags and went out to explore the city. We arrived back at the hotel around 3:30 thinking we might get in then. There were tons of people waiting and we were told that our room wasn't ready and we would need to wait until 4pm. At 4pm we were given our room keys and went up to our room but it was still being cleaned. After several minute we were allowed in.I booked the hotel on the hotel's website with Radisson and took advantage of the best online reservation clause and got a really good deal on the room. If you find a lower price then what they are offering the room for they will match the price and beat it by 25%. The hotel is right on Broadway and W 32th St and really close to Macy's and only 10 blocks to Time Square. If you pick this one you shouldn't be disappointed. If you go for the executive room they are very nice and the continential breakfast with the room is great.
134,1894,"Jan 11 2008 	Loved It	I loved the Martinique. The room was very clean, bright and the bed was DELICIOUS. The location could not have been better. The best experience I have had in NY city. The doormen were curteous and attentive to details. The front desk staff REALLY NICE. checking in and out was a breeze. The restaurant downstairs was good but we only had dinner there one night. We had breakfast accross the street from the hotel in a place called Speedy's and their breakfast selction in GREAT. right around the block from the hotel they have a LOT of places to eat although we opted to have dinner in different palces in Manhattan each night. I must that nothing beats MANHATTAN, NY during Christmas time.We oipted to purchase the hop on and off tour and it worked great for usas we went for 5 days and had time to see almost everything.When I return to NY city I will stay in the Radisson again cause I loved it!"
135,1894,"Jan 6 2008 	Great Location	Just got back from a two night stay - Friday night/Saturday night. The positives: 1. Only waited about 10 minutes to check in and it was 1/2 hour before check in time. 2. Good location - Close to Penn Station and the Empire State Building.3. Subway entrance right outside the hotel....very convenient when it is cold out. (Tip...use the website hopstop.com for directions on what trains to take depending on your destination.)4. Iron actually worked well! I was pleasantly surprised. Irons that don't get hot or that leak water all over your clothes is one of my pet peeves.5. The shower curtain rod had a curve to it, allowing more elbow room in the shower. The bathroom also had a heat lamp in it which I enjoyed while drying off.Negatives: 1. The beds only had two pillows on each bed, one for each person since we had four people staying in the room. There weren't any extras in the closets. 2. The bedding was worn with holes in the blankets.3. The elevators are pretty slow - I tend to be an impatient person but this might not bother other people.All in all, the hotel was neither spectacular nor lousy. It was mediocre. Did the job it was supposed to do of providing us with a clean room and we enjoyed our trip."
136,1894,"Jan 4 2008 	Don't waste your money	Really not worth the money. I'll start with the bad since it gets to the point.Cons..._ Approxumately 10x10 room! Only enough space to walk around the bed_The toilet was constantly flushing in my room and in another (I could hear the other toilet through the walls...)_The mattress was hard, cardboard-ish; seemed flat and cheap _Towels were stacked on a rack in the shower and would get wet if you're splashing about :)_Television reception was very poor, thought they were using rabbit ears in the 21st Century. _Room was too close to the elevator, within 12 feet. Poor building design, I could hear hotel traffic _Window with dungeon view of picturesque utility room vents and brick walls. Don't open the curtains._4pm check-in; waited in line till 5pm to get in my room..check out promptly at 11am Pros...Good location, nice soap and free city maps.I guess I expected a little too much from Radisson for the hard earned money I spent. My rating for this hotel is 1.5 stars; what you see is not always what you get.Disenchanted Traveler and Spouse,"
137,1894,"Jan 4 2008 	try to avoid	We booked this place due to a very good deal they had running, but Radisson in general and this place in particular is far below average. We won't be coming back. The elevators are working so poorly that it was often literally faster to walk downstairs from the 8th floor than wait for one... The TV is ancient and doesn't work properly. Room temperature is pre-fixed and cannot be increased... The bonuses are the location (although if you don't like tourist crouds, this ain't for you!) and the free wireless in the room."
138,1894,"Jan 4 2008 	A Real Pleasure / Treasure	Before we arrived we read the negative reviews for this place, all I can say is that some folk need to chill, put a smile on their face, and dont write reviews when your jet lagged. Spent Xmas in NYC with family, this hotel could not have been better. The staff were always courteous and helpful, great concierge staff, bell captains and door staff to be especially commended, rooms perfect, great bar/restaurant off the lobby, and perfectly located. Outside is 'Little Korea' great bbq places, some are 24hr! Empire State in next street, Macys five minutes away, all you need for shopping within ten mins walk. We walked all the way up 5th to Central Park and back via Times Sq, twice, no problems at all,safe at night. Dont miss Jack Dempseys two minutes away, and a great deli next door to it for breakfast or late night chinese. Coffee's at 'Speedy' diner opposite the hotel are excellent. We will certainly be backPeace"
139,1894,"Jan 3 2008 	Have had better but also alot worse	This hotel sounds very up market and the first impressions on arrival are that it is - however, once you get past the glitz and glamour of the lobby area and the red carpeted entrance the hotel is pretty worn and torn and very average.We Stayed here on New Years eve 2007 for the sole purpose of being within walking distance of times square (which we ended up not going to anyway!) - which was achieved. The location of the hotel is about 5 minutes walk if that, from Macy's and about 15 minutes from times square itself.We got a limo from the airport and were greeted promptly by the concierge who took our 9 bags up to our rooms. Check in at this hotel is 4pm, but when we arrived only one of our rooms was actually ready (we arrived at 5pm) the other room took until 9pm to be serviced which was very disappointing. The check in took over half an hour and the queue was nearly out of the front door, but I guess thats what you get on new years eve in NYC.The rooms themselves are typical of a big city hotel, a little tight on space, and not the most modern I have ever seen. All of them have a mini bar ($3.50 for a can of coke). The beds are reasonably comfy, and the shower is fantastic.Our biggest gripe with this hotel was getting a late check out. Our flight back to the UK didnt leave until 7pm and we wanted to check out late so we could sleep in before the seemingly endless journey home. We asked at the front desk on the night of our arrival and was told we had to request it the following morning - we ended up having to set our alarm clock for 8.30am to call down to the front desk. We were told that we could stay on until noon for no charge, but up to 2pm would be an additional $95 per room. We decided to keep just one room on and pay one $95 fee. After popping out for some last minute shopping as we were now awake anyway, we returned to the hotel at 1pm to find we had been locked out of the room we had paid the $95 for. Very frustrating.This hotel is ok - not fantastic, but not awful either, for NYC the location is good and the price isnt too bad - Just Dont expect lots of space in your room and be prepared for slightly dated decor."
140,1894,"Jan 3 2008 	New Year in New York	We booked the hotel 9 months in advance because our stay included New Year, and arrived on 29 December. We were a party of 6 adults in 3 rooms and made a request for rooms together at the time of booking. We also repeated this request direct to the hotel by email 1 week before arrival. On arrival we found our rooms were not ready and were then advised that we could not have 3 rooms together, not even on the same floor! We wasted an hour trying to check-in even though we had completed on-line check-in from home prior to departure. Only 2 rooms were ready by this time, and the 3rd room was not ready until 1 1/2 hours later. Many other people were having check-in problems and the reception area was crowded with frustrated people trying to check-in.Despite this the rooms were comfortable and the furnishings, etc quitenew. Our room was the opposite side of the hotel to our friends on thesame floor, and our other friends were eventually given a room on the floor below. Very disappointing since we had booked so far in advance and made our requests at the time of booking. It very quickly became obvious that airline crews arrive in large numbers, and are given preferential treatment and pre-assigned rooms. Their check-in is swift, whereas ours and many other people's took ages. The hotel is large and the staff are quite sparse in numbers. The service in the restaurant was slow and the food nothing special. The location is very convenient for Macy's and Empire State Building, and the subway entrance is right outside. We used the subway to get aroundevery day, buying a 1 day fun pass for $7, which allows unlimited local travel for 24 hours. We found the subway system easy to use and very convenient.We booked a meal in a restaurant in Times Square area, which was very disappointing. The restaurant was Saigon 48 in West 48th Street, and we booked it through a company advertising on-line. The whole evening was very disappointing because it did not match up to that advertised.We were not able to see the &quot;ball drop right outside their doors&quot; as promised because the restaurant was not close enough and the police had all the surrounding roads blocked off. The crowds were massive, and had been building since lunchtime that day. Times Square on New Years Eve is not for the faint-hearted. Unless you are prepared to stand around for hours, without being able to go to the toilet or get something to drink, it is probably better to avoid Times Square area altogether, and watch the &quot;ball drop&quot; on TV screen elsewhere."
141,1894,"Jan 1 2008 	Decent and Good Location	This hotel is located in a great area for shopping on 34t street or a 15 minute walk to the 5th avenue shops. The hotel is small and very basic, but you get what you paid for. The rooms are very very small but typical for NY standards. If possible, try to get an upgrade to the Penthouse level 1 or 2. The staff seemed pleasant although very busy. The only negative thing I have to say is that the rooms are small, washrooms are tiny and the elevator is so busy that it takes about 10 min to get to the lobby from your room."
142,1894,"Dec 29 2007 	Absolutely Do It Again	I'm a travel agent, and having stayed in NY this past summer, I was skeptical about finding a well priced and reasonably spacious room. I read the reviews, and they were mixed but I took my chances. I was pleasantly surprised from check in to check out. Impeccable service, pleasant staff, great location, nice restaurant. And the room was quite spacious for a NY hotel. I recommend this hotel, and I would definitely stay here again!"
143,1894,"Dec 27 2007 	Great Place!	This hotel is very nice, clean, and accommodating. We did not have anyproblems at all. The staff were friendly and offered assistance to help us find the different sight seeing locations in NYC. The hotel restaurant bar was a little slow, but we still got what we ordered. Wewill stay at the Radisson again, without a doubt."
144,1894,"Dec 26 2007	Great Hotel!	I booked our room through the Radisson Web site and later found a lower price on Hotels.com. Since they guarantee online rates, I submitted a form and was sent a reply within 24 hours saying that my claim was accepted and that I would be receiving the lower rate minus 25%.The hotel was steps away from the subway; blocks away from Penn Station and Macy's. Our room was clean, neat and the shower was great.Our room was right near the elevators and ice machine, but I couldn't hear either unless I was standing near the door.For the amount of people in the hotel, I was surprised at how fast theelevators ran (this was a problem in our last hotel). They have 3-4 computers in the 24-hour business center with free internet access (15minute time limit if people are waiting).Overall--it's a solid bet if you need a place to stay in Midtown."
145,1894,"Dec 19 2007 	Perfect Stay	Everything was perfect! The location, the friendliness of the staff, the cleanliness of room, and the SIZE! Large for NY standards! I do not have any negative remarks on my visit and would stay there again in a heartbeat. I know there are more &quot;trendy&quot; places in the city, but the Radisson didn't fail me at all"
146,1894,"Dec 19 2007 	Clean helpful great location	Landing in New York for meetings one afternoon before travelling on to Philly this hotel is turned out to be in the perfect location. One rule I don't like is that check in isn't until 4pm, my room wasn't ready, so I was provided with complimentary drinks. There were LOTS of people waiting around whose rooms also clearly weren't ready but the receptionist did his best to get it sorted and I was in the room in about 20 minutes. Another member of staff was being curt to customers with simliar complaints and I wasn't dealing with her. Hotel room is very clean, air conditioning worked, central location, nothing especially special about the hotel, just does what it says on the tin."
147,1894,"Dec 18 2007 	Average at best	Just back from 4 days of Christmas shopping with a friend. We were lucky enough to secure a discounted rate of $389 per night on the penthouse floor - which by the way if you're thinking of booking - don't bother! Even though we paid half price I cannot stress enough how 'NOT PENTHOUSE' this floor is. On arrival there is a lounge with a series of unmatching chairs pushed in to circles. This is where you have your breakfast - quite nice to just have it on the same floor, but odd as you're sitting on a sofa effectively eating off your lap or a very low down coffee table. The rooms are fine. In fact, no they're not fine at all. for 200 a night I have stayed in beautiful rooms before. This one had 2 double beds with good linen but a tattly yellow throw. The bathroom was wall to wall plastic marble effect which although clean was so dated. The carpets in the hallways looked about 20 years old (i'm sure they are) and in need of a thorough clean. Whilst our room was really nice and quiet there was no view at all - just of another wall and the airconditioning unit stays on all the time (you can't switch it off) as the windows don't even open a crack. So you have an annoying loud humming noise to listen to all night. In summary though, I would say it's a 2star hotel at best. Staff OK, not exceptional, old style hotel that is in a GREAT location! Guess that's the attraction and why they've got lazy with the inside of the place. People come to be back in the centre of mid-town."
148,1894,Nov 28 2007 	Loved the shower	Friendly reception staff on arrival although that was it. The doormen were useless with no help with bags opening heavy doors or helping us to get a taxi. The room was fair size and comfortable with a small bathroom although the shower was great. Really powerfull and always hot water. Our view was another building some 10 foot away which made it quite dark and a need to always have the lights on. A great base nr Macys and the Empire State and a great litlle cafe called Martinique whcih served great breakfast.
149,1894,"Nov 14 2007	Could have been better....	Well I stayed here a while back and it was so-so. First of all I was very disappointed with the front desk staff. When I had contacted the property to book my room I requested a room with a sleep number bed and was assured I would get one. Upon arrival, however, I was told that they did not have any rooms with sleep number beds available and on top of that we wouldn't be able to get a room with a view either...another thing I had specifically requested. The room we got was a corner room overlooking the building next door. There was a room across from us and needless to say theys ure had a good time, as the walls were paper thin and I could here every part of their very intimate activities. (I think you all know what I mean). There wasn't ONE working vending machine. I am pretty sure they do this on purpose so you have to pay $4 for a can of warm pop from their overpriced minibar...which by the way had expired warm beer in it. The cleaning staff and the doormen were very friendly and very helpful. Although the room was ok and the location was good, I probably wouldn't stay here again because the hotel doesn't seem to give a damn about specific requests and really didn't seem all that concerned about it. The place is a glorified Holiday Inn (it originally was one but they changed the name) and for the price we paid I should have been able to get the room I requested and a front desk staff who actually cared about the enjoyment of their customers."
150,1894,"Nov 14 2007 	Great breakfast and staff!	This was a bit of a rush booking, as the hotel we wanted was fully booked, but the cloud ended up having a silver lining. When we arrived, the reception staff informed us that they had no triple rooms available (even though we'd already booked and paid for this). They apologised, sorted us out with a double room w/sofa bed for the first night, gave us complimentary breakfast the next morning and then upgraded us the next day to an executive room - worth more and bigger than the room we originally booked. The staff remained professional, helpful and friendly at all times.The breakfast was buffet, although they do have an a la carte option, and it was great, typically American. Hotel is in a great location, opposite Macy's and backs onto the Empire State building. There is also a nice restaurant downstairs which is nice for the first night, when you don't want to trek around looking for something to eat. Again, typical American/international cuisine, but tasty enough and reasonably priced."
151,1894,"Nov 11 2007 	Very Poor for a USA hotel	I visited this hotel as part of a customer service tour and they are the perfect example of poor service, from rude staff to clueless on reception. I waited for over an hour to check in on a Tuesday afternoon when we arrived!. We did not get there until 4pm so it wasn't as if we where early.We had a meeting in one of their rooms the next day only to be encoutered with more rudeness as we had the cheek to put our bags in the room, making it hard for them to get the coffee in.No request politly to help, just a lot of tutting and huffing about how hard it was.Calling reception from the room was a joke, 10 minutes to answer the phone.My room was OK, clean, but with no view only a wall, some of my party did not fair so well with the box rooms.As previous reviews have said, great location, terrible customer service, they do concentrate on the airline staff.My party was 15 people and I can honesty say none of us will be back to this hotel."
152,1894,"Nov 9 2007 	loved the locationfab bellhops	We stayed here over the easter holidays , hadn't read reviews on trip advisor which i've only just discovered. The hotel is in a brilliant location, we arrived before checking but the bellhops stored luggage until we could check in, he also recommended a good irish bar around the corner opposite the empire state building for food. Check in took a little time but we also had breakfast included which we weren't expecting and was a great bonus, our roonmhad 2 double beds and was on the larger side, big enough for the three of us, as we didnt spend much time in the room it was more than adequate. Most of the staff were very good the door man and bellhops very friendly.Overall our stay was excellant and we have booked to stay here next year. When we left we had arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport and was provided with a limo for the same cost which made us feel very special."
153,1894,"Nov 1 2007 	Two Weeks--Five rooms--Overview of the whole operation	This hotel cannot handle the volume of travelers who process through every day.Rooms vary from large to tiny closets. Many airline employees from a lot of different overseas airlines stay here and form the stable basis of their business. I think that they are given priority over private individuals who book this hotel. They have a seperate check in area at the business center and they demand immediate access to rooms when they arrive. If there is a problem flying out again--flight delays--then they dont check out of their rooms and the result is total chaos. The front desk is a disaster. All the delays describe elsewhere occur most of the time checking in and out. The hotel appears to be busiest on Friday, Sat, and check out time on Sunday morning. Lots of people check baggage and spend Sunday in the city--then there is another rush as they want their bags to head for home in the afternoon and early evening. Monday thru Wednesday everything is slower paced and more relaxed.There are some outstanding employees working the front of the house--bellmen, security guards, and doormen worth noting are Ronnie, Jose, and Caesar. Others are good but I did not learn their names. Dawn is good in the executive breakfast room.Having access to the executive/penthouse lounge is worth the extra money. Continental breakfast, afternoon cocktails and snacks, and a place to hang out and use your laptop out of your room is invaluable. Wireless does NOT work in the rooms but does in the Penthouse and the lobby."
154,1894,"Oct 30 2007	Not too bad	Got a special rate for this and for this rate that i'm paying, I guess I have nothing much to complain about!The rooms are relatively small. But that is NY style. Not much space after you place 2 twin beds, dressing table. The toilet door is just 1 foot away from one of the beds! However, the rooms are clean, beds are clean. The only complaint was of my pillow. I should have asked for a better pillow or more pillows....but well...Security is quite tight. The guard will ask that you show your key card if you come in late at night. Location is great as there are shopping areas just outside the hotel. Food is available 24 hours as you are sort of in Korean town. Some of the Korean restaurants open 24 hours. There is good breakfast areas around the hotel too!! Oh, there is a train station JUST outside the hotel. How convenient is that!! Checking in was slow....but it seems like that in NY. People behind the counter seem to take their own sweet time which becomes a little frustrating cos all I want is my room. Check out was simple! Just say my room number, and that's it!"
155,1894,"Oct 29 2007 	Needs a make-over	This is one of those hotels which is looking a little under the weather and is in need of a make-over. Service, rooms etc. are fine, location is great but it is obvious that a make-over is needed. Decor, carpets are furnishing all need to be replaced."
156,1894,"Oct 7 2007 	Great place!	We stayed here for a week and found hotel to be a very nice clean, friendly place, room was OK, (as there were 3 of us) not a bit like some of the reviews we read, but the reason we picked it was that (rightly so )most of the reviews we good, And also in good location for Macys, Empire state building,Madison sq. grns, Time sq etc.would stay here again next time."
157,1894,"Sep 23 2007 	Great bargain hotel.	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of August. Being New York, we were expecting a small room but we were there to see the city so didn't mind. To be honest, I thought the room was an ok size. The bathroom was very small but clean and functional. We were lucky to be on the 12th floor at the front of the building and had a view of the Flatiron building. Overall the room was clean, with a comfortable bed, plenty of towels and nice toiletries. The concierge was helpful and even booked a table at a restaurant for us at our request. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast and thought it was good - I'd avoid the buffet upstairs though as it is a rip-off. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel as it is in mid-town with a sub-way station outside the door making it very handy for tourists who wish to explore the city. I agree with another reviewer who recommended avoiding the Korean restaurant next door - probably the worst meal and worse service I've ever had in my life!"
158,1894,"Sep 11 2007 	Extortionately Priced	I shared a room with two friends for 3 nights - the price was OK - it worked out at 65 per person per night. However, my friends checked out on the Monday morning and I stayed over for one more night, in the same room, on my own. The price for that night? 160! I could not believe it. They had swiped my credit card on arrival so by the time I checked out and was given my invoice they already had their money. I have stayed at another hotel in New York (Pennsylvania Hotel, right opposite Maddison Square Garden and next door to Macy's) and was charged only 75 per night. This hotel does not warrant the price they are charging.As for the service, the front desk staff were OK. One of the concierges was nice but there was a different one on every time I left/arrived at the hotel so I never saw him after the day I arrived! The maid cleaned and tidied every day, bringing fresh towels. I am just completely annoyed at being ripped off in this way."
159,1894,"Sep 10 2007 	An OK Hotel	My husband and i went to NYC for a quick get away and to see some Broadway shows.Stayed at the Radisson because we used our American Express points.I did not have high expectations of this hotel because i read some of the reviews at Tripadvisor.Thus i was not surprised when our room is small, bed uncomfortable, bathroom is even smaller and the hotel staff were just OK.We were too tired at the end of each day to pay particular attention and we basically used the room just to sleep because we were out all the time.If you go to NYC you probably have better choices than this hotel. One piece of advice, do not eat at the Korean Restaurant next door. The front desk staff recommended the place and the food was awful, prices high.You could get better food with better value elsewhere.We went there our first day because we were starving when we arrived and wished we didn't."
160,1894,"Sep 9 2007 	Loved our stay	My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 9/1-9/4. We definitely enjoyed our stay. It is perfectly located on 32nd and Broadway, just 10 blocks from Times Square. There is a subway station right outside the door of the hotel, so you have access to the entire city.The only bad part of our stay was the check-in. We arrived at noon and of course that was too eary to check in, which we understood. When we returned at 4pm to check in, there were 2 people working the front desk and I was 5th in line to check in. Within 5 minutes the line had grown to about 20 people. They finally brought one more person out to the desk to help, but it took until 4:40pm for me to get checked in (I would hate to think what time the last person in line checked in).Other than the check in , we loved the hotel. Yes, the room is small but from everyone I have talked to, most all NYC rooms are small. It was clean and quiet. Face it, if you are a tourist in NYC you will not spend much time in the room anyway.The doorman was fantastic! Any help getting somewhere he could help."
161,1894,Aug 31 2007	tiny rooms	The first junior suite room we were allocated on the &quot;executive floor&quot; was tiny. I left the family there and went back to reception. I looked at the next suggested upscale suite and rejected that too. Eventually I gave up and we took a standard room that was a long walk from the elevator.
162,1894,"Aug 23 2007 	Closet-sized rooms!	A big group of friends went to NYC for a birthday celebration. We got 5 rooms. My room was a closet-sized room in the back of the hotel with a wonderful view of the brick building next door. The room only had a double bed, The toilet ran all night long and there was absolutely no natural light in the room at all. We called the front desk to request a room change, they said they were all booked for the night but the following night we could switch. We called again the next morning to verify and they said they couldn't switch us afterall. Then 20 minutes later the front desk called back and said we could switch. But the new room wouldn't be ready until after 3pm, so we had to get all our stuff out of the room by 11am and check our baggage with the bellhop. Another hastle. We literally waited in line for the bellhop for 40 minutes to check our bags! When we returned later to retrieve our bags and check into our new room, there was a line almost out the front door with people checking in. The line was not moving. The staff behind the desk kept disappearing for chunks of time and were not helping anyone. It took another 45 minutes to get our new room key. We even used our cell phone to call for a manager and no one showed up. The staff is slow, unhelpful, clueless and rude. The 2nd room we got was more bright and spacious and had sleepnumber beds. But that did not make up for the terrible service this hotel provides."
163,1894,"Aug 21 2007 	Beautiful	We booked this through Expedia for under $180 a night. Our plane was delayed by 5 hours so we didn't check-in until almost 11:00 p.m. They didn't have the room we paid for so they UPGRADED us. Our room was huge. And the Sleep Number beds are wonderful. The staff was so friendly and the building is beautiful. We asked the doorman for recommendations to get something to eat at midnight and he was so friendly and directed us in the right direction. I believe if you treat people nice they will return it. Check-out was a breeze. The only thing I could find bad was that only two elevators were working. And there was no way I was going to climb that winding staircase up 18 floors, but it sure was nice to look at."
164,1894,Aug 15 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	This hotel was an excellent choice. Close to the subway and a short walk from a lot of attractions. I was very happy with the room and the service we were provided. This hotel is one I would use again. We were on the street side and never heard any noise except for one fire truck.
165,1894,"Aug 14 2007 	Rudest front desk staff I've ever met in a hotel	All front desk staff we interacted with were rude and not personable. (2 women and a male) They all had extremely poor customer skills and attitudes. The special rate we were given when we booked the room was not honored because we did not have the confirmation letter we were supposed to have received (which we did not). I'd advise anyone who feels the need to book a room at this hotel to make sure they receive a confirmation letter or make arrangements to do so before their arrival date.Check in time is 4 p.m. (later than most hotels we've stayed in). I'd advise against anyone trying to check in earlier as they can't accommodate an early arrival let alone a 4 p.m. arrival. Make sure you check out at 11 as I would not put it past them to charge you for an extra night if you were a little late.Hotel was dirty with food trays (food still on them) in the hallway on the floor from check in time until when we arrived back at our room after a late dinner around 9 p.m. AC did not work correctly and the room lacked some of the simple amenities normally found in a hotel room.If you're looking for the following two things: comfortable bed and good location and you can live with what I described above, then by all means this is a hotel for you."
166,1894,"Aug 3 2007	Shabby not chic	Stayed here for 2 nights in in July 2007. Midtown location is OK but hotel lacks any charm. Not the place if you want somewhere welcoming to come back to after a long day.Room was tiny and 'pump up' bed did not work. Lifts are slow with long waits, decor has seen better days.Check in/out staff cleary used to dealing with volume rather than taking time over welcoming guests.Overall nothing wrong, but nothing to make me go back either"
167,1894,"Jul 12 2007	Ummm.. do jump to stay at this hotel	Stayed here last night and i eager to report of my experience... it was NOT a good one. We got in around 1 pm and tried to check in early and they said we had to wait... which was ok, but then we got back at 4 pm (check in time), it took over an hour to check in. There was only 2 front desk people who weren't te nicest. We were informed parts of the hotel didn't have air conditioning and they gave us ONE free drink coupon at the bar!The experience continues: we walked up to our room and put in the key as normal when we opened, there was a naked man in our room!!! We went back downstairs for the front desk lady to tell us jokingly, she assigned us a taken room.. when we got up to our new room, the cleaning lady was still cleaning.. it was 5:30 at this time. The poor cleaning women didn't even have a cart for his supplies, just a bucket.. in her hurry, we were left with a made bed but used water bottles and tolietries.. i don't blame her but the hotel.. as we were waiting to check in, there was dozens of airline pilots and attendants checking out (5 hours after the supposed check out time of 11). this is why the cleaning people were behind and why many rooms were ready at 4 pm. (on a side note: don't ask my why airlines pay for their crews to take chartered buses to go into the city to stay at a midtown hotel when they could stay at a airpot hotel... the airlines need to look at there overhead )anyways, after that two hours of terror... we had an OK experience... the towels were all different, some super ratty and one was brand new BUT it pilled all over me and i had to take another shower to ge the fuzz out of my hair. the mini bar had cokes for $3 so stock up on a local market. the location was good, that was the best thing about it. i wouldn't stay here again... so, just book with caution.."
168,1894,"Jul 8 2007 	Great location wonderful service 	Having only been to NYC once before (on business), I was VERY nervous about the hotel selection for my return with my husband and 15 year old daughter for the week of Spring Break. I have trusted TripAdvisor for years and this time, really counted on the information about the Radisson's central location which was absolutely true. AAA offered a rate we couldn't refuse. Easy access to the subway, reasonable walking distance to just about everything...shows, food, shopping, Empire State, etc. The concierge (Mike) was a wonderful help from the first night on. Our stay included a free breakfast buffet which was WONDERFUL...a real money saver &amp; the hostess knew us by name by day 2. Front desk was helpful &amp; polite &amp; the back door exits to a small gift shop...a great shortcut to the next street over &amp; lots of fun to visit. Housekeeping was great &amp; checkout-was easy. No surprises. I will absolutely consider this hotel when I visit NYC again &amp; I recommend that you do too!"
169,1894,"Jul 1 2007 	Great location but... go back in time!	Stayed here for a 3-day business trip. Used to Marriott's &amp; Hyatt's, this hotel is not quite up there. Everything was booked so thru AAA, got a $297/night rate which is becoming to be the avg. to stay in NY at a reasonable rate. The room was medium sized (2 full beds) and large for NY standards. But the accs. and furnishings were old and boring. TV reception was pathetic. The worst was the smelly bathroom. Attributed mostly to a moldly shower curtain.Had dinner there as I could not find anything nearby open at 10:15 pm on a Tuesday night. First burger was charred/burnt and had to ask for another one. The 2nd one was raw and still moving!I will not stay here again."
170,1894,"Jul 1 2007 	Not what we expected	Given the price we paid to stay here for several nights we thought we were going to get a pretty decent hotel room and upon our arrival the hotel seemed fine. It had an okay lobby, but everything after that was downhill. The doorman and the front desk attendants were cold and quite unfriendly (an exception being the bellhops who were refreshingly pleasant and helpful). Also the front desk provided us with inaccurate information about the hotel which proved troublesome. The room itself was small, but that's to be expected; what we didnt except was the awful bathroom. The tub was stained and damaged like nothing I've ever seen, the bathroom was right next to one of the two very small double beds in our room, which by the way had sheets which were also stained and there were holes in the blankets. The room also felt unclean and icky. Several days later we stayed at a comfort inn which was a big relief from the ickiness of this room. Also there was another door in the room which connected to another hotel room and we could hear our neighbors conversations, at times it was so clear its seemed they were in the room with us, walls were beyond paper thin. NY city is expensive so it's hard to find something reasonably priced, but either we got the worst room in the hotel or we over paid. The local of this hotel is okay, subway close and the hotel is in Korea town which was interesting, good ice cream at a nearby store and several nearby Korean restaurants. Also you can walk around and find lots of food places. The only somewhat good thing about this hotel was the location of on 32nd street, not too far from points of interest, but for most places you still need to get on the subway. Don't go in expecting much at all. Okay for maybe 1 night, but I would not stay here again, there's way better out there."
171,1894,"Jun 28 2007 	great location	I was afraid to go to this hotel after reading all of the negative reviews. This was my first time at a Radisson, (I typically stay at Westin and Hilton chain hotels). Clean and quaint hotel. Elevators were fine, typical New York City elevators. People that complain about the elevators are silly, they should spend time in other NYC buildings! I was pleasantly surprised, I stayed in a sleep number bed suite. I had a blast! The hotel is very convenient and the staff were very hospitable. Great location, convenient to restaurants, subway stations (around the corner), bus stops, etc. Try Speedys fast food restaurant-excellent!, the hotel's restaurant -Cafe Martinique was fine, although I ordered their soup of the day (granted it was the end of the day), they gave me a bowl of room temperature broth, instead of a hearty soup that I was expecting. It is in a Korean neighborhood which I thought was great, since there isa Korean restaurant onsite, and there is an ice cream shop on the same street that seemed to be the spot to get ice cream. You can't beat being close by to Macy's flagship store (7 floors!) (a must see there is even a floor numbered 1 1/2!). Also, there is a drug store (Duane Reeder?? on the same block (to buy drinks, toiletries, etc), a specialty cosmetic store around the corner, and a quaint small park in the middle of broadway... I'm sorry but you can't beat this hotel. I was going to book at a Westin but so glad I did not since I drove past it and it was right next to a&quot;gentleman's club&quot; ."
172,1894,"Jun 20 2007 	perfectly adequate	I had a fairly small size room, but it was clean, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. The air con was a bit noisy - but I could sleep through it. The service was prompt and pleasant. I have no complaints."
173,1894,"Jun 19 2007 	A room for the night but thats all	My travelling companion and I stayed at this hotel in June and it was very very busy in the sorrounding area, more so than when I stayed 'uptown' 18 months ago. The hotel itself is OK, although the room we were allocated was very dark and the lamp wasn't working. The bathroom you could hardley turn round in as it was so small- but that didn't cause too much concern as we took the view that we were just in our hotel to sleep. At least it was nice and quiet at night considering it was so central. On one hand it is great that it is next to Macy's and the Empire State Bulding is around the corner and Madison Square Gardens is a block away, but on the other hand this makes it so busy. It is difficult to walk out of your hotel in the morning trying to avoid the hoard of tourists who clamber every inch of the pavement. Hustle and bustle is at its premium. Because it is so near the touristy areas, there is little in the way of bars and restaurants nearby. In fact the immediate area outside of the hotel is a bit dingy, so it is a case of having to get on a subway or taxi to either Greenwich Village (which was lovely) or uptown. Having stayed on 57th Street before, near Central Park, I would much prefer that area. It is quieter, slightly more geared up for the more discerning tourist and there are loads of lively bars and restaurants. Even though I was a tourist ion New York, I didn't want to surround myself with other tourists and I especially didn't want to eat a Korean in the nearby vicinity each night.Each to their own - but probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again."
174,1894,"Jun 18 2007 	Good Hotel Great Location!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel. The staff was very friendly - especially the staff at the concierge desk - particularly one gentleman named Jose. He helped us figure out the subway routes and which stops to get off on and was very helpful. They helped us hail a cab several times as well. Upon arrival they securely stowed our luggage as we arrived before check-in time. The staff in the on-site restaurant were friendly too. The room was a tad small but 90% of the hotel rooms in NYC are small too. It was a good value for the price. It's located right by the subway so it was never difficult to get anywhere as we could hop on the subway literally right outside the front door - which was a great plus I thought! The only minor complaint I would have would be that the thermostat in the room was a bit touchy and it took us about 1 1/2 hours to get the room to a comfy temperature. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
175,1894,"Jun 15 2007 	Great location but stay somewhere else	My experience with Radisson hotels is generally very good, but this one is a miss. OK, they have great beds, but that's it. Service is poor. I had a huge corner room with 2 bathrooms, sofa, fridge etc., but no hangers and nowhere to hang my suit! My suggestion is to stay somewhere else."
176,1894,"Jun 1 2007 	Security Breach at this hotel - exercise extreme caution	Recommend anyone wishing to book to stay at the Radisson Martinique use careful consideration as I stayed there back in April 2007 and had a $ 200.00 pair of shoes stolen from hotel. What's even more disappointing is the extremely poor customer service I have received since then with having to deal with numerous people (being thrown from person to person with no-one in the chain taking accountability) and the hotel chain using classic stalling tactics to brush the whole thing under the carpet.Just writing this as I feel that as a fellow traveller don't want anyone else to go through the hours of various modes of communication that I have had to endure for the hotel still to disregard the matter and not take it seriously.Try Starwood, Marriott and Hilton for better all round security and customer service in case you ever have to deal with a situation like mine."
177,1894,"May 28 2007 	Yes A Definite Rat Hole	I have to agree with the many previous reviews that although this hotel is in New York and therefore in a great location, it is better to stay elsewhere. The rooms are indeed small and dirty, the restaurant, food and service are truly nasty, the concierge does not know what she is talking about and couldn't care less. The women at the gift shop/sundries bar don't know where the department stores are, won't give you change or directions or the time of day; but they do have a nice brass shingle that says &quot;concierge&quot;. The mini-bar sign sums up the hotel philosophy: basically, don't get comfortable and put your stuff here! The toiletries couldn't be cheaper or more harsh, and at over $400 a night. The elevators are incredibly small, old and overcrowded; the front desk moves at a snail's pace with long line-ups. The door people won't hold the doors open for you especially if you have luggage. The doorman who is supposed to get cabs spends most of his time singing to himself and avoiding you. Front desk treats you like you are some strange interloper and shows no courtesy. A complete crap experience which will sour your visit to a wonderful city."
178,1894,"May 26 2007	Great Service with a beautiful room	My sister and I and her 2 children spent last Saturday night in NYC at the Radisson on Broadway. We had the greatest time, thanks to the service we received at the Radisson by wonderful man named, Redmond, upon our check in. We had a reservation for a standard room but I asked at check in for a room that would be big enough for the 2 children. Redmond gave us a room with a king size sleep number bed and 2 rollaway beds for the kids on a high floor with a beautiful view of the city. We couldn't have been more pleased. The room was beautiful... The Radisson was very conveniently located 2 blocks from Penn Station and we could see the hotel sign immediately when we walked out of the train station on 7th Avenue....that was a relief for us...I was afraid we wouldn't be able to find it.... It was a short, safe walk to Times Square and the subway was right out front... We loved the Radisson and would stay there again......we were impressed by the service we received from Redmond when we checked in....it made our day!"
179,1894,"May 15 2007 	The Radisson (Rat Hole I Sum!) NYC 32nr 	The Radisson (Rat Hole I Sum!) NYC, 32nr &amp; Broadway This hotel has great potential and an outstanding location. Execution is lacking. Front Desk staff had a pleasant, albeit, New York vibe. The elevators however, are a new twist on Three Card Monty: One had duct tape on the floor, choice number two had squeaks of gerbils on wheels providing vertical lift (thank you Richard Gere), and number three seemed to work just fine. Fat people: Stay away! The size of the room equals New York generosity, Tight! At over $400 USD/night, I have enjoyed an Oakland Ca. Motel 6 that was 1/8 the price and 1/3 bigger. A four-night stay ran over $1,700 USD. Fat people will run away when they see the mini-bar. A sign says Do Not Store Personal Items on it. It blinks advertising messages and sales and discounts on the LED display. The in room safe is below and integrated in the mini-bar. How cold! Chrome-Dome: Sometimes you just got to go. While going, I noticed the filth on the chrome drain underneath the sink. Icky! When rates exceed $200/night, a guest should expect body care products of superior (read; Aveda) caliber, not the knock off no name items supplied. They sufficed, yet failed to excel in delivering value. Unacceptable at the rate paid. The balance of the room was fairly void of dirt disasters, but the AC was difficult to operate as was the stops preventing more that a 4 opening of the window overlooking Broadway and the park below.  Access to a subway stop without crossing a street was wonderful. The in house restaurant was marginal, and typical of the Manhattan new food service paradigm: Huge, low quality portions with illegal workers delivering labored English as a second language communication. Bring a Russian interpreter for services; otherwise youre gambling like a Vegas buffet. Bottom Line: NYC is truly expensive, and if youre picky, youll need to drop several hundred dollars more per night to enjoy satisfaction. This is no deal. Any discounts on shopping you enjoy will be eaten up by outrageous food and lodging costs. Go to Hawaii, the weather and recreation is better."
180,1894,"May 11 2007	Great hotelexcellent location	My husband &amp; I stayed here for 3 nights ( 4th-6th May ), I have stayed in a few hotels in NYC and was very pleased with our choice at the Radisson Martinique. Excellent location-especially for new visitors to the city, as it is on the doorstep to the subway, a short walk away from the Empire State and 42nd stree/Times Square. The rooms was clean and a decent size for NYC especially as most of the time spent is on sightseeing. We were on the 5th floor and it wasnt especially noisy considering the location and we were able to sleep! The service at the hotel was brilliant, the front desk were very helpful ( printed out addresses of places I was looking to find! ), the gift shop gentleman was always smiling,the bellmen couldnt hav been more helpful and organised a town car to get us to the airport too -very prompt service too! All in all this was an excellent stay!Manchester UK"
181,1894,"Apr 26 2007 	Not a good hotel if you are a business traveler.	Not a good experience. I travel frequently for work and stay at hotels about 150 nights/year. I usually stay at Marriots and Hiltons but they were all booked up for this last minute work trip. I will not be staying at this hotel again! The 'free' wireless was a joke. The signal was so weak in my room that it didn't work. The rate I booked also was supposed to include a free breakfast but upon check-in, they had no idea what I was talking about. The manager finally did provide a coupon for it after I complained. Also, I was under the impression that all rooms would have the Sleep Number bed, which is Radisson's big selling point. This was not the case; I just got a normal, bad hotel bed with typical hotel polyester bedding."
182,1894,"Apr 20 2007 	Bad service but Great location clean hotel	This is a great hotel with great location. The room was clean and the service at the restaurant was pretty good. But, the services provided by manager (s), bellboys, doorman and what not are just plan bad. Seems like they are just not interested to serve you. It took us 20 minutes to check in because the guy at front desk had to finish 'some stuff' before serving us...so we waited.Other than that, this hotel is worth your money."
183,1894,"Apr 20 2007 	Fab hotel!	My daughters and I went to New York to celebrate my 50th birthday. RMartinique was highly rated on tripadvisor so I booked it. We were NOT DISAPPOINTED. In fact, we were delighted. From the very first greeting by the cheery doorman to the last farewell, we were made to feel welcome and special. They could not do enough for us, nothing was too much trouble - the hotel's motto seems to be 'no problem!'.The Empire State Bldg is the hotel's back yard, Macy's its front. Other attractions are easily accessible and the subway is right next to the front door - it could not have been better placed.The rooms are airy and spacious by New York standards; the lifts work well; there is a safe in the room for which you have to pay but the safe in the lobby is free and accessible 24-7.The hotel is very flexible - on the last day, the hotel kindly agreed to us checking out at 1200hrs instead of the usual 1100hrs; then we wanted to store our bags till 1700hrs - the hotel kindly obliged again. Remember: 'no problem!'.We had literally lived in Macy's and other similar enticing establishment along 5th Ave so our bags were full to bursting. Understandably, we needed help to take our cases down the steps of the subway at 34th St. A VERY SPECIAL thank you goes to Mickey the Bell Capt (2nd from left in the photo) who smiled and just said, yes you've guessed: 'no problem ma'am'! He got his colleague and together they carried our cases down the blessed steps. This is service beyond the call of duty, for sure, and most appreciated. The only problem I had was that the room did not have a kettle, only a coffee maker so until such time as I got to the hotel restaurant to sample the excellent breakfast which did include tea, I was a tad grumpy in the morningSo: if you want a terrific hotel in the heart of Manhattan and don't want to take out a second mortgage, go to the Radisson Martinique - if you like tea, do take a portable kettle along.And when you see Mickey, tell him we said hello......;-)"
184,1894,"Apr 18 2007 	Loved it!!	What a great hotel! Perfect location - right in the middle of everything. Subway right outside the door. We could see the Empire State Building from our room. It was a small room, but we didn't care. We had enough room for the two of us. Can't comment on any extra service as we didn't require any. The concierge was very nice. They were all very helpful directing us to where we wanted to go. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone."
185,1894,"Apr 17 2007 	Rude Manager	I stayed one week on April at the Radisson Martinique. It was ok, great location for the money.My only complain is about the Fitness Center, there is NONE, I found a tiny smelly and hot room at the basement with two old treadmills. At check in they give you your key room in a small envelope that says Our Goal at Radisson is 100% Guest Satisfaction, if you are not satisfied with something, please let us know and well make it right or you wont pay Its a pity the manager never read this. I went to the front desk and talked to him about the lack of fitness center and he couldnt care less. He was rude and didnt try to be helpful at all. The rest of the personal at the Hotel is extremely nice."
186,1894,Apr 17 2007 	Excellent Hotel	We just returned from a weekend in New York. We stayed at the Radisson for 2 nights. (One of these nights was weather related due to flight cancellation). The check in was quick and efficient. We had booked a standard room. We received free breakfast from AAA. We used the concierge service to book tours and to get directions. The staff was extremely friendly. The doormen were great about hailing taxis for you. The location is great. The rooms are great. There was absolutely no noise which was excellent for such a centrally situated hotel.I would recommend this hotel to couples or families and would definitely stay again!!
187,1894,"Apr 14 2007 	Excellent hotel in great location.	Stayed in this hotel in April 2007 for 6 nights. The check in was quick and efficient. We had an executive room on the 18 floor which was spacious,clean and had a small kitchen. There was no noise which was excellent for such a centrally situated hotel.Access to the 17th floor executive lounge for complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails etc was exceptional. Very centrally located hotel only 10 mins walk to Times Square and 5 mins to Empire State. Would recommend this hotel to couples or families and would definitely stay again!!"
188,1894,"Apr 2 2007 	Excellent for a travellers hotel in New York	We stayed for five nights from 21st to 26th March 2007.We were pleasantly surprised as normal 3 star New York hotels offer postage stamp size rooms. Ours was clean and spacious with comfortable amenities. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful.The location of the hotel is excellent offering a subway station just outside that has direct lines to uptown Central Park &amp; Bloomingdales as well as direct services downtown to Ground Zero, Brooklyn Bridge, China Town &amp; Little Italy.Macey's, Penn Station, Empire State Building &amp; Times Square are all within walking distance.A money saving tip if you are flying into JFK is take the Sky Train to Jamaica and then pick up the Long Island Rail Road into Penn. If you are lucky the journey take about forty minutes and costs $10 per person instead of the $70 cab fare. Only do this if you have a minimal amount of luggage.On the whole we would thouroughly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a good travellers hotel in New York. Do look around for deals, we got five nights for the price of four, as the normal starting prices are high even for New York."
189,1894,"Mar 30 2007 	A central hotel close to everything	This a centrally located hotel within easy access to all the New York sights, the Empire State Building is right behind on the next block and is open until 2am ideal for insomniacs. We arrived at the hotel at 12.15am and were unable to have the room which we originally booked through the agent, no change was available as the hotel was full on the Sat night. We were changed the next day for the rest of of our stay together with full buffet breakfast which compensated us for the loss of the exec room for the first night. Hotel is comfortable, the number sleep beds are great, the staff very friendly, lifts are a little slow and creak under little weight, breakfast was plentiful and the staff most helpful and friendly.Concierge was very helpful with tours on our first morning. Take the two day bus pass and do all the loops, they really give you a good view of the city and if you want to go back to a certain attraction you can either hop off the bus or walk. Yes walk, every where is within walking distance. There is a subway station at the corner of the block under the hotel and the subway is as safe as the London Underground, we travelled back from South Ferry Terminal to Penn St Station $2 for a single ride anywhere not bad @ 1 to $1.9. If you have a late flight back after the 11am check out the Bell captain will look after your cases until you get picked up, they will even call for the shuttle you've booked when they dont turn up on time. Full marks to that."
190,1894,"Mar 27 2007 	Acceptable but lacking	Stayed Friday and Saturday nights, Location is great, staff friendly courteous, had to call to have maid service at Sat. 6:00 pm. cereal available Sat. am but not Sunday am. I've had better for $400 a night but it is New York..."
191,1894,"Mar 20 2007 	Five stars!!	The Radisson Martinique is absolutely awesome. It's a little more expensive than other hotels in the area, but it's worth it. As a jetlagged traveller, it was just wonderful to get to my room to find a comfy, clean bed, a bathtub, cable TV and free wireless internet access. The breakfast was amazing - a full American and Continental breakfast served in the restaurant.The staff were very friendly and helpful. It's in a great location, too - there's a subway stop right underneath the hotel, and it's only 1 block from Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Macy's."
192,1894,"Mar 17 2007 	Enjoyed Our Stay	I recently stayed with a friend from out of town at the Radisson Martinique for a leisurely weekend. We were originally booked at another &quot;hotel&quot; on the upper west side (but that wound up being a mess). So we had to find another hotel quickly and fortunately, the Radisson was very accommodating. They took us on short notice (same day). We got a great AAA rate, and the staff was very friendly. The lobby was very nice, the check-in was smooth, the hotel was very well maintained and our room was spacious, clean and well furnished. We even got full complimentary buffet breakfasts for two, for the entire weekend. The room service food wasn't great, but the restaurant itself was good. The neighborhood is right in the heart of midtown's action - close to everything...fun nightlife, great shopping, and a good multicultural vibe of people. There seems to be a big Asian community in the area, so the Korean and Sushi restaurants, bars and clubs are very authentic. Our stay was fun and very comfortable. I highly recommend it."
193,1894,"Feb 28 2007 	Great location good hotel	After staying in a rubbish hotel down the road for one night, the Radisson seemed like an oasis!The conceirge was helpful, the rooms clean and breakfast good but not outstanding. The room had everything you would want, and although my room was not very spacious it was very comfortable.It was a nice and consistent chain hotel, in an excellent location. I would recommend!"
194,1894,"Feb 26 2007 	Busy Hotel Busy Location	The Martinique is a busy hotel, at a very busy corner. The hotel sits diagonally across from Macy's and right on top of the a Subway entrance for 34th St Station. The immediate street is loaded with Korean restaurants, many open 24/7. Since we were with children, we were not given permission to try any of them. But their menu's looked good and prices were reasonable.The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and the heat worked well. Only issue was that a lot of water dripped out of the shower no matter how carefully we adjusted the curtain.The staff was helpful and polite. We asked them to hold on to our bags until later in the night on the last day of our stay. Didn't eat anything at the hotel, since there were so many other options across the street or around the corner. Only issue was that we didn't receive a non-smoking room as we had booked. We opened a window to air out the room and weren't really bothered but there was a tobacco smell in the corridor. We didn't feel like changing rooms since we were only staying for two nights."
195,1894,"Feb 11 2007 	Good hotel but slightly overpriced	I stayed one night at Radisson Martinique in NYC in the middle of the summer in July. I got a room very high in the building with an amazing view and a quite spacious room to be a single room with all the nescesary ammendants with and luxurious bathroom. The location is absolutely brilliant and the staff is absolutely outstanding. The only things I could complain about is that there was some problems with the Mini-bar that was locked by remote and couldn't be opened even by the staff, that there was no breakfast included with such a high price and that it was, like I experience every Radisson Hotel to be, very overpriced in accordance to what you get. But don't get me wrong, it's really a luxurious hotel, but that thing with the breakfast made me dissapointed."
196,1894,"Jan 20 2007 	great stay great location	Have always stayed at Crown Plaza in Times Square. This time stayed here for a change. This hotel is excellent. Was remodeled last year very nicely. Very clean rooms, quite at night, and gracious staff. I preferred it for location, price, and service. Subway station outside door about 20 yards. Great Korean resturant next door. Spent 5 days here Jan 11-15 and will stay here again. Easy walk up Broadway or Ave of Americas to Times Sq (10 blocks). Very clean streets and well lit even at 4am. Empire State Bldg next block over, Macy's across street."
197,1894,"Jan 17 2007 	I loved this place!	I've stayed at a lot of hotels in NYC and except for the Ritz, this is my favorite! The location is so central and easy to travel from. You can jump on the subway or catch a cab right out front.I ended up with a handicapped accessible room and it was huge...especially the bathroom. It was also very clean and the beds were comfortable.I had no problem checking in early.The restaurant downstairs was perfect for breakfast.The one bad thing I could say is that the walls are a bit thin so if your neighbors are loud you are going to hear them."
198,1894,Jan 16 2007	Loved the Radisson Martinique	Met every expectation. Paid 75 per night for a double room for 4 nights.Location was superb! Housekeeping excellent. We weren't flying home until late on the last night and were offered a late check out for 45 which allowed us to use the room until 6pm! (we could have checked out at 1pm at no additional cost.)Would definitely recommend this hotel for those wanting to stay in the heart of NYC.
199,1894,"Jan 14 2007 	New Year	We weren't sure what to make of the Martinique as quite a few of the reviews painted a picture of chaos, but our travel agent has never let us down, so we arrived on the 27th December. We turned up just before 4pm &amp; booked in straight away &amp; went to our room on the sixth floor. I had asked for a quiet room because of other reviews, the room was fine &amp; a reasonable size but had no view. This was our first visit to New York so we weren't too bothered as long as the room was clean. First impressions were not that good, the lobby was small &amp; very busy with a lot of flight crew. The bar &amp; restaurant was all very open &amp; could do to be sectioned off to give a more intimate feel. We had a meal that night in the hotel &amp; were happy with the service &amp; quality. The following morning we had breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant. $15 for the buffet was more than we needed but the service &amp; food we had was ok. We did see one of the waiters completely ignore a guest &amp; refuse to even discuss there request. There did seem to be a bit of tension so I can't comment on what lead up to this but no one forced these people to become waiters or work in the service industry &amp; to ignore the very people who contribute to there wages by staying in the hotel is completely unacceptable. We decided that we would eat out after this. On consecutive days we had to chase housekeeping as our room hadn't been cleaned by late afternoon, this was after informing them earlier in the day. On one occasion we talked to housekeeping twice &amp; then contacting the reception desk. The mini bar, which we found to be fine &amp; offered $15 credit if you spent $15, was never restocked the whole of our stay. Check your bill on departure as the $15 credit wasn't included in our bill but was deducted when pointed out, I put it down to an oversight. We found the concierge to be very helpful &amp; used them to book tickets to the Empire State &amp; Statue of Liberty (take the advice, get there early to beat the queues). The best thing about the hotel is its location, come out of the hotel &amp; turn right onto Broadway &amp; Macys, turn left &amp; walk to 5th Avenue. The Empire State is only a block &amp; a half up 5th &amp; next door is the Heartland Pub &amp; Restaurant. This place was great for food &amp; service, we ate here quite a lot. Times Square is a 10min walk up Broadway as is Bryant Park. We walked up Broadway to Central Park &amp; down 5th, quite a walk but a great way to see the city, we did this several days stopping for lunch &amp; visiting stores. The restaurant in Macys is worth a visit any time but especially for breakfast as is Andrews Coffee Shop &amp; the Brooklyn Diner. We had lunch at the Stage Deli, it was ok but could do with a make over &amp; is maybe living on its reputation. If you go to Macys make sure to pick up an International Savings Card for 11% discount. This review may not sound very good about the hotel but to be honest it's not as bad as some of the other reviews &amp; most of the staff were very friendly &amp; helpful. The location is excellent &amp; we felt very safe especially at night when security check everyone coming into the hotel. When we go back to NYC we will probably try another hotel but would be happy to stay here again. If you go for New Year as a couple or group of friends then try to stay right in Times Square, after 6pm you can't get near. Taxis from JFK are $45 + tolls ($49), we flew back from Newark &amp; that was $65 arranged by the Doorman."
200,1894,"Jan 4 2007 	This place is AWFUL	Ok, so we knew we'd have to pay an arm and a leg to stay anywhere in Manhatten during New Year's Eve, but we expected at least a clean environment. Due to severe asthma, I made a point on contacting the hotel prior to the stay and requesting a non-smoking room. Well, the room was techincally a non-smoking room, but due to the ventilation in the building and the lack of constant circulation to filter the air, our non-smoking room became a nasty smoking room in the late evenings. When we called downstairs for help with the situation, they offered air freshener! Finally, we did get a maintenance man to unbolt the window and tuen on the heat. When we told the manager about this, he was very accusatory and doubting of our experience. For over $500 a night, I'd expect a bit more! The food was awful in the restaurant as was the service. In fact, most of the staff was rude except for the front doormen who were very helpful and friendly. Stay away from this lemon....great location, but you'd be better off a bit farter away and with something that didn't smell like a 20 year old ashtray."
201,1894,"Jan 1 2007 	Great Location awful service	Stayed here over New Years 2006. Will not return. Pro: -Just off of time square-Accommodated an early check-in.Cons:-No service what so ever. Never once had a doorman open a door or offer to help with the luggage. Neither housekeeping, room service or the concierge would provide a corkscrew to open a bottle of wine (we had to carry the bottle to the hotel restaurant and back up to the room). Called the concierge to look up time and location of a movie for us, and her response was we have to come down and purchase a news paper for fifty cents if we want that information.-Very very small rooms. (Can not fit 2 queen beds, 3 people max with roll away.)-Did not have sleep number beds in our room 1034.-Heater unit in the room couldn't get the room above 70 degs F. Was even colder closer to the room's window.-Charges for use of the room safe and room refrigerator is actually a vending machine that charges as soon as something is removed from it. No room to fit anything in it except maybe a sandwich turned sideways. -Business center would not provide or loan a pen to write down location of restaurants on our street map. (We were looking them up online because we gave up using the concierge for anything)."
202,1894,"Dec 28 2006 	Above average. Especially for a Radisson	We want to like Radissons. For Minnesotans like us theyre the hometown hotel chain and we desperately want them to succeed. Unfortunately, too often they end up being a step (Or two. Or three) behind their peers at Hilton or Crowne Plaza. Thats why the Radisson Martinique was such a nice surprise. All of the hotels elements we experienced were well maintained and perfectly acceptable.The lobby: Least impressive of the hotels attributes was the lobby. The small lobby is entered off 32nd street and while it was not crowded while we were there, I can see it becoming a zoo if a large group was checking in or out. The business center: We didnt bring the laptop (We wanted to take a weekend off work) so we never tried the in-room internet. But we did check our e-mail using the free computers in the small business center off the lobby. Bonus to the hotel for not charging.The fitness center: Tiny. And under equipped. Still, there was a stylish and recently remodeled one available in the basement. And given the space limitations in Manhattan, a gym that would be underwhelming anywhere else was acceptable.Restaurant: While we didnt eat there, the restaurant appeared stylish and even had a separate entrance on Broadway. Across the street is the Manhattan Mall which has a decent food court on the basement level.Location: Outstanding. Seriously top notch. Exiting the lobby you have to watch your step or youll fall into a subway entrance. (34th street on the yellow lines.) The hotel is only a few blocks from Penn Station. Macys is a block away, the Manhattan Mall is across the street and Times Square is a 10 minute walk north.The room: Fine and a generous size for Manhattan. Im not certain exactly what type of room we ended up in, but we were very satisfied with what we got. We had reserved a basic room using a free stay coupon. I suspect we were upgraded (The clerk had to ask a manager before putting us in it). We ended up on the 16th floor in a room with a small kitchenette area and recently remodeled dcor. We saw no signs of wear in the room at all. For that matter, the we didnt see any wear in the hotel. Our complaints were a matter of personal style more than any deficiency with the hotel. We prefer the stylish urban earth tones that Hyatt and W emphasize. The Radisson, however, was done in the upscale suburban Atlanta dcor that Marriott seems to prefer. Our king size bed was a Sleep Number with clean white bedding. While we want to love the Sleep Number bed (another Minnesota company), we dont. The first time I slept in one I was alone and it was fine. But as a couplealas, it seemed designed to push us apart. There seems to be a ridge running down the center and along the edges as well. So no matter how you adjust the mattress firmness you still fell like youre sleeping in a pair of shallow boxes. The room had a pullout couch and a TV with no armoire. Had we pulled the couch out we would have needed to climb over it to get from one end of the room to the other. Finally there was a small alcove area with no door that served as the closet. The most disappointing part of the room was that the view was of an airshaft. Still, we had two windows to view it from. I asked the maid if all of the rooms were renovated and she told me No, not all are. However, the front desk told me that all rooms had indeed been renovated. I would tend to believe the maid. So I suggest asking for a recently renovated room. I suspect the nicest rooms have the Sleep Number beds in them. Pity. The bathroom: Fine. And average. The sink was marble and we had a tub, but it was still a little cramped. It came stocked with the full compliment of Asira toiletries (Which seems to be the Radisson house brand as well as a knock off of Aveda toiletries. Which is, in turn, another Minnesota company. Ill bet you had no idea how many Minnesota companies there are!)The staff: No complaints. We were not allowed to check in immediately upon arrival at noon, but they had a room for us by 2pm. And while I wouldnt call the front desk staff warm they werent openly hostile and did their jobs efficiently. One thing worth noting is the hotel entrance policy. At night they really do check to make certain youre a guest as you walk in. Even at midnight we were asked to show our key. Some might find this comforting although I personally was irritated by it. Its not like a prostitute could get into the hotel and conduct business. Not with Sleep Number beds in the room preventing it.Overall: A perfectly sane choice in New York. We found it to be clean, renovated and containing all of the required amenities. And the location was excellent. Id stay there again without hesitation."
203,1894,"Dec 21 2006 	Average hotel great location.	Stayed here for 4 nights last year. The best thing about this hotel is its location; very handy for Maddison Square Gardens, the Empire State Building and Macy's. Whilst the staff was friendly and helpful the hotel itself we found to be pretty basic and in need of refurbishment. Our room, although spacious and reasonably clean, just felt shabby. The dining room seemed dark and uninviting so we didn't use it, preferring to breakfast at one of the many good cafes in the area.You can pretty much walk everywhere from this hotel. We walked to 42nd Street to see The Producers, walked to Times Square for dinner in the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co Restaurant (complete tourist trap but fun), and walked with our Big Apple Greeter (volunteer New Yorkers who show visitors around for half a day - definitely worth arranging before you go) to Greenwich Village and Chinatown. We loved New York and are planning to return next year. We will not however be staying at the Radisson Martinque. It wasn't bad but, apart from location, has little to recommend it."
204,1894,"Dec 18 2006 	Overall a good experience	After reading some of the reviews on this site I was a little apprehensive, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The location is hard to beat - right at Herald Square. The front desk staff, although a little slow at check-in, and the bell staff we very helpful. The rooms were clean and a decent size for New York standards.Elevators are very slow, and one of the three was out of order for the entire weekend, but that was our only real inconvenience, which wasn't much of one at all.We arrived very late - around midnight - and had booked two rooms. Much to my surprise, we were still assigned rooms right next to each other.I would certainly stay here again."
205,1894,"Dec 14 2006 	Fine Experience...	We stayed at The Radisson Martinique on a last minute journey into the city for one night.Check-in was complicated by a huge number of teenagers, part of a tour group, running wild. The check-in lobby had a stale, sewage-like smell that became unbearable as we waited (and never disappeared throughout our stay). Then, our room wouldn't open. However, the staff was SUPERB in taking care of our frustrations- they put us in a penthouse room.The room was much nicer than the lobby- clean and airy. Rather small by Ohio standards, but we knew to expect that in NYC. Most notable about the room was the Sleep Number bed, adjustable to your liking in softness/hardness. This hotel sits right on the edge of Koreatown, and we ate at a lovely Korean restaurant a few stores down. We were able to comfortably walk to Times Square, and there's a subway station right on the corner of the hotel also.Make sure to visit the cheap Jewelry District right near the hotel- wonderful deals on costume jewelry."
206,1894,"Dec 10 2006 	Hated the Hotel - Loved the Doorman!	Pretty disappointing experience. The only positive was the doorman - great guy! Our room was freezing - it appeared to have a motion sensor so the heat wouldn't go on unless you waved your arms in front of the thermostat. The room was so small that 2 people couldn't be in the bathroom at the same time. Housekeeping didn't bother showing up at all one day to clean the room. The food and service at the restaurant was terrible. The chandelier in the lobby has about a quarter-inch of filth hanging on it, and the restaurant restroom was filthy. Poor management. We would not recommend this hotel."
207,1894,"Dec 1 2006 	Good location	We stayed here during the NY Marathon, when it was nearly impossible to find a room under $400-$500 per night. After reading reviews I was uneasy, but pleasantly surprised. My fiance and I are seasoned travellers and tend to stay more upscale, but not for this trip where we did not plan to spend much time in the room. We did however require Mid-town Manhatten.All staff that we encountered we very friendly. We recieved an upgrade to a room that included a couch with pull-out. That said, the room was fairly large for NY standards. The finishings etc are average and the view was of a brick wall, but really, who cares? You're not in NY to sit in your room and look out the window!I would have no problem recommending ths room for those looking for a decent, average (no-frills) place to stay. Just make sure you request a room away from the elevator. i heard it whirring all night and often woke up to it."
208,1894,"Nov 23 2006 	you can do better	The housekeeping service is very rude, they will wake you up every morning demanding to be let in.The ventilation is horrible in the rooms, and we stayed when it was chilly---the heating went from cold to hot, so we were either freezing or stuffed.The front desk confused our reservation, and we were originally placed on an all-smoking floor.Overall, this was an unpleasant experience. The only highlight of this place is its location, and even then there are better places for much better prices out there."
209,1894,"Nov 22 2006 	Great at the right price	Like most things I guess it's all down to money. I was really lucky, I had originally booked this hotel when it was a Holiday Inn at the Wexas rate of 170 dollars and Radisson were good enough to honour this even though the cheapest rate had gone up to 360 dollars. It was close to Thanksgiving!For 170 it is great value but not for the man in the lift I heard saying to his colleague, 'I'm not staying in this crappy hotel again for 400 a night'. It is a clean hotel and the rooms are a pretty good size. The buffet breakfast is basic but good value. There is a reasonable coffee shop and small bar. However the two things that stand out are its excellent location (it's minutes from Macys and the Empire State Building) and the friendly and helpful staff.So I'd stay again if I could get a rate of 250 dollars or so a night."
210,1894,"Nov 1 2006 	Great location friendly staff	We were having a reunion of sorts in NYC, there were four of us from Canada, who hadn't seen each other in years. We booked the Radison through Priceline, so it came at a decent price. The room was small, but just fine- 2 double beds, and a rather small bathroom for 4 women. There were lots of towells. The hotel was very quiet, and in such a great location for exploring the city. The hotel staff, like everyone we met in NYC, were helpful, friendly, and very accomodating. We checked out and left our luggage on our last day, and the bell captain was extremely helpful in helping us figure out how to get to JFK. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but discovered Speedy's across from the hotels, which had great breakfasts. Would stay there again, as long as the price was right."
211,1894,"Oct 29 2006 	Average Hotel Would Not Stay Here Again	My wife and our two small children stayed here in October of 2006. We took Amtrak to the city and then took the subway to the hotel, the subway stops right accross the street from the hotel. Upon entering security asked us, &quot;are you staying here&quot; very rudely. I said we are checking in. He then proceeded to watch us walk to the front desk. My wife and I both were required to show ID to check in. Every time we left the hotel and returned, which was several times, we had to show ID at the door. This is unacceptable to me as a guest. If they have this much of a security problem then they should hire more security staff. Also you are not allowed to have any guests past midnight!! This is absurd. I have paid for the room and it should belong to me. The room was average and showing some wear. The beds were not comfortable and the bathroom small. The wireless internet was almost unusable. I would not stay here again."
212,1894,"Oct 24 2006 	Loved our stay at the Radisson Martinique	The hotel was beautiful and very reasonable in price. The rooms were small but really nice and comfortable. The Sleep Number bed was a treat. The room was super clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful in directions, suggestions and getting us around. The hotel is in a great location for walking to alot of tourist attractions. Time Square, Empire State Building, Fashion Dist. and Macy's. We really enjoyed our stay at the Radisson and will stay again when we go for another visit as well as tell our friends to stay there. I highly recommend it. I do not however recommend the resturant that is in the hotel. We ate there one night late and it was horrible. Expensive, terrible service and the food wasn't good. Hotel Excellent...........Resturant....Not Good"
213,1894,"Oct 21 2006 	A slew of minor frustrations	Stayed on business, 4 nights midweek in October '06. First the good...The room was not large, but not tiny either, as many in NYC are. The room was quiet, no problems with either street noise nor with staff &amp; guest noise. It was decently furnished, and well-located just off Herald Square. That said, a slew of service issues will keep me from returning. The biggest problem for me was that the in-room wireless internet was nearly unusable (#1). Despite an &quot;excellent&quot; signal and an 11 mbps connection, most web sites were very slow to respond and many timed out. I called the front desk, and they gave me the toll free number for help, but I couldn't write it down, because there was no pen in the room (#2). Three calls to the help line over two days failed to resolve the problem, which they admitted was on their end.I thought I might try dial-up instead, but nowere in the room was the usual card showing local phone costs (#3). Inquiring at the front desk, I was told the rates, and per-minute charges on local calls start after just 10 minutes (#4). That could have made for an unpleasant surprise at checkout.There were other service problems besides the telecom. When I checked into the room, half the lamps were unplugged (#5). The lightswitch by the door did not control any lights, but did shut off power to the alarm clock (#6). And the housekeeping always shut off all the lights, so on return, you had to walk thru a dark room to find a lamp to turn on.On my 2nd day, I got back after work to find a light on, only because my room had not been serviced at all (#7). They promised to send housekeeping right up, but it was almost an hour before they came.I expect issues like these at lesser independent hotels around Manhattan, but for a national chain, that is priced comparably to the Marriott's and Sheratons on the island, it's disappointing. I will look elsewhere for my next NYC trip."
214,1894,"Oct 19 2006 	An Ok Hotel but ...	The Martinique on Broadway is a well located midtown hotel, one block away from the Empire State and Macys. It is within walking distance of Times Square. We tried to check in at 2.00pm, but were told the room was not ready and to come back at 4.00pm. When we returned the receptionist still had a struggle to find us a room. Overall the reception desk was not a welcoming experience. The room we had was a triple. It was small, containing two narrow double beds. Decor was a little tired and the bathroom had seen better days. The good news was that it was at the rear of the hotel away from the traffic noise.Avoid the mini-bar - $3.25 for a can of soda! There is a Duane Reade drugstore virtually next door charging the proper prices.Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was adequate, but expensive. Better to find a diner for better value.Overall an OK experience, but could have been better. The Virgin Atlantic cabin crew that flew us over stayed there so it can't be all bad."
215,1894,"Sep 19 2006 	Excellent NYC hotel!!!!	I was long-planning a trip to NYC with 2 other friends. Neither of us really knew where we should be staying, but a co-worker of mine recommended we stay at the Radisson Martinique on Broadway. I was a little apprehensive because of some of the negative reviews I've read on this site, but she assured me it was a great place to stay. So I took it upon myself to suggest it to my friends, and they said they would take my word for it... which made me nervous. I was afraid we were gonna end up in a squatty, unclean hotel with unfriendly staff - imagine my relief when we got there and saw how great it actually was!! The room was spacious and spotless (and the windows were as clean as they could be for Midtown Manhattan). The air conditioning worked perfectly (important for a trip to NYC in August). There was always an abundance of clean towels and toiletries, and housekeeping always kept our room looking and feeling great. We were only there for 5 days, but by the time we left, the staff in the hotel shops knew us by name and took a genuine interest in our trip and where we were visiting from; and the doormen/security were so friendly and always had a smile when they saw us. Speaking of security, it's very effective in this hotel. Nobody gets through the doors without being greeted by a plesant doorman or security guard. They would either ask to see a room key or they would inquire about your business in the hotel if you weren't a guest. We didn't spend much time in our room... just long enough to get a little sleep and get ready to go out again. The little time we did spend was comfortable and relaxing, the high-speed wireless internet access was an asset, and room-service/food was fabulous. The hotel was in such a great location!! Sitting on top of major subway routes and beneath the enormous Empire State Building. It was surrounded by great shopping, cafes, restaurants and clubs; and just minutes away from... well... EVERYTHING!! Walking distance from Times Square, quick subway rides to lower Manhattan or Uptown (or you could take a cab between this hotel and just about anywhere in Manhattan for less than $10). It's hard to squeeze NYC into a 5-day trip, but the central location of this hotel made it easy to do so much!It was a little expensive at just over $250CDN/night, but it was clean, safe, comfortable, quiet and convenient. New York is an expensive city, this hotel is not THAT expensive in comparison. I would definitely stay there again, and I would recommend it to anyone."
216,1894,"Sep 14 2006 	Okay stay	We booked this stay last minute while already in New York and in need of a getaway from the family in Queens... so we were a little desperate and probably willing to overlook some things. When we arrived (10 a.m.) the front lobby was quite cramped with arriving guests and of course we were told to return after 4pm to check in. Once we returned we quickly got to our room which did have the odour of smoke but we were too tired to call down to get it changed. Caveat emptor.Of note the hotel is in the area known as Little Korea to the locals; a few streets surrounding have Korean groceries/cosmetics stores etc which were interesting. These did not impact on our stay in any way. We saw an asian action movie being shot at 4am on the street in front of the hotel!Overall an okay hotel with a good location, but it is 10+ blocks from Times Square and worth the 3 or 4 subway stops especially if you're in heels ladies... A fine stay but if you have the opportunity, shop around as others have suggested."
217,1894,"Sep 8 2006 	Quality Hotel in Herald Square	The hotel is the former Holiday Inn located in Herald Square. It's a very busy section on NYC, much like the craziness of Time Square with a more urban, youthful demographic. It's a unique and interesting neighborhood, centrally located to the subway, Madison Square Garden, and Macy's. I got to the hotel at 5 PM an hour after the official check in time. I did check in on line the night before but one needs to stop by the desk to get the room key and show id. The small lobby was packed with airline crews and foreign tour groups. After maneuving my way through the crowd I felt fortunate their was no line to check in. I walked up to the desk which was staffed by two clerks. I said I checked in online and requested a quiet two double bedded room with a sleep number bed the hotel advertises in &quot;some&quot; of the rooms. The clerk said she only had a sleep number bed in a king bedded room. That was fine by me and actually my requests were granted. My room had a pull out sofa bed along with a comfortable, well appointed king size bed. I wanted an extra bed in case a local friend wanted to stay over. The check in clerk was a very nice woman who did mention my Priceline status upon check-in. After talking my credit card info, she pointed me to one of the two elevator banks. I was assigned Room 924 which faced inwards to a courtyard. I was nicely surprised when I opened the door. The room was large by NYC standards and had minibar, a large desk, two phones, tv, and microwave. The sofa was nice and would serve as another bed if needed. The king sleep number bed was great. The bed linens were of decent quality and the color scheme was a pleasant white with blue and yellow trim. The bed was remarkably comfortable once I figured out how to use the controls. The bathroom was fairly standard stocked with Radisson bath products. The shower/tub was clean and the towels were soft. Also, this hotel has free wi-fi in the rooms. I really like not having to pay to use the internet. There was plenty of light in the room and the curtains shut out any sunshine for good sleeping. Hotel security checked to see if I had my room key each time I entered the hotel. I appreciated that level of service especially in such a busy area. Furthermore, there is a all purpose restaurant on site, a very small fitness room with limited equipment, and a business center that I did not use. I did not order room service either. There is a good pizza place and deli up the street. Fast food places surround the hotel as well.Oh yeah the gift shop cashier acts as the conceirge. That is kind of funny to see in action but can lead to long wait when buying a newspaper or bottled water. Moreover, the air conditioner in this room could have been stronger even after a maintenance man took a look at it. In addition, the tv reception could have been clearer. I wish the elevators ran faster and where a bit larger too. Yet, in spite of the busy neighborhood and some small little things, this hotel was a winner for me. I got it for $150 a night but noticed another bidder got this property for $135 on the same nights as my stay. His post was closer to the date of our arrival.The Radisson Martique on Broadway is a well run, nicely kept three star quality hotel. It is not as nice as the Hilton Times Square which is a four star property but certainly superior to the small pathetic rooms at the three star Paramount. If the Radisson Martique remains on PL, I would continue to avoid 3* MTW and bid 3* MTS along with a few other zones.I would be very happy to stay at the Radisson Martinque on Broadway. I felt I got a very good deal for NYC."
218,1894,"Aug 29 2006 	Decent midtown price/value	I stayed for a couple nights on a business/pleasure trip at the Radisson Martinique and thought it was a pretty decent value for the money (what do you expect for 240$ a night in New York!?!)It is very very well located, within 5 minutes walking distance of Penn Station and right next to the Empire State Building. It was also an easy walk to Times Square and the Broadway Theaters.The rooms were allright, nothing spectacular. The staff was friendly and helpful, though I didn't request anything very special.If you can get a good price, I would reccomend this hotel for a weekend in the city or a business trip."
219,1894,"Aug 18 2006 	Look Elsewhere - Sub-par	Long story short - I booked this through Priceline, sort of last minute at $200 a night and didn't really expect much. Needed a place in Midtown for work.I had a sub-par experience. I was given a non-smoking room that reeked of smoke and had to switch. Bell/luggage service was very slow. The room itself looked more like a Holiday Inn in Cinncinnatti or Altoona, Pa. than a Radisson in mid-town Manhattan. Soft pillows, only two, and a hard bed. Overall, very sparse. This is disappointing considering I stayed at a different Raddisson only a week earlier. The other one was at, I believe 50th or 51st and 3rd Ave. Much better, cleaner, etc. So, this hotel should be a second tier choice or choice of last resort if you plan on spending ANY time at all in the hotel/your room. It will NOT fulfill any romantic ideas of a cool, mid-town hotel/experience.However, I must credit the desk staff which was attentive and helpful. So, I think they have good/OK people here. The property is just tired."
220,1894,"Aug 18 2006 	OK nothing special	Stayed at the Radisson Martinique over the weekend July 15/16 2006.I booked the hotel through Radisson's central telephone booking service, &amp; asked for a hotel central to Times Square. The night I was booking, I had no internet available &amp; phoned all the main hotel chains. The operator assured me that this hotel was near Times Square, and that it was a new Radisson hotel, so was great value. Both of these were grossy misleading: the hotel is not near Times Square: its almost at the foot of the Empire State building, and it is not a new hotel: it used to be a Holiday Inn, and looks fairly dated, with mismatching wall paper, carpets etc.The rooms were rather old fashioned, and the bathroom small and in need of some TLC. The hotel was clean enough, and although not to my taste, it was serviceable and relatively inoffensive. I wouldn't stay again, but if you're just looking for an average price, average place to lay your head, its probably OK. A number of the airline crews stay there, we noticed. Its also a hell of a lot better than the nearby Pennsylvania, where we had previously stayed.A word of caution: if you eat either breakfast or dinner in the hotel restaurant, watch out for the service charge, which they'll include automatically in the bill. They shouldn't do this, but we didn't realise &amp; ended up paying heftily for some really so-so service."
221,1894,"Aug 14 2006 	Clean and friendly	My daughter and I just spent a wonderful weekend at this comfortable, scrupulously clean and friendly hotel. The staff, from the front desk to the bellmen, were all very friendly and helpful. We asked for directions, for subway, walking and driving and were given accurate directions cheerfully. Our room was comfortable and while we did not have much of a view, it was extremely quiet which was more important to us after our busy days. The location, right near shopping, Penn Station and subway lines, was ideal. A restaurant on the ground floor was convenient. We would highly recommend this hotel, and we plan to stay here again."
222,1894,Jul 25 2006 	got stuck in elevator for an hour with out ventilation	on july 23 we were checking out the elevator gets stuck with 3 other guys and no kind of fan. and when i get out i was not offered any water but one guy went to the hospital for heat exhaustion. joevargas@gmail.com
223,1894,"Jul 20 2006 	Not bad - but overpriced	Great location if its your first time to NYC. Right in the middle of it all (note, this used to be called the Holiday Inn until a few weeks ago).Service was fine - generally friendly. Rooms were clean, up-to-date and comfortable BUT our room was small and the bathroom was tiny. Stayed at a few other hotels in NYC that werent the same class but actually had much larger rooms for a cheaper price. Try Hotel31 or Hotel17 - both great locations and larger rooms for at least 1/3 of the price.Overall a good experience, but not the best value."
224,1894,"Jul 19 2006 	Great Location - Terrible Service	My daughter and I stayed here from June 28 - July 2nd. Our trip to NYC was her highschool graduation gift. We too were surprised to learn that the hotel had changed names from the Holiday Inn to the Raddison that very day. I was very nervous when we arrived, afraid our reservations would be lost in &quot;change-over&quot; land, but they weren't. Everything was set up as we planned. We didn't arrive until after 8:00 p.m., so I am guessing we missed all of the commotion and delays those arriving earlier in the day encounted (I guess it is a good thing the airline lost our luggage :). Our room was on the eleventh floor. Frustrated from dealing with the airline over lost luggage. We were just happy to have a room! The location was great, and the doorman was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction of a close, good, and not too expensive restuarant for dinner. We found Walgreen's around the corner, loaded up on basics - in hopes our luggage would arrive the next day. Walked back to the hotel and turned in for the night. All night long we heard the toilet cut on and run for about 30 seconds every five minutes or so ..... very annoying. We learned quickly to close the door so not hear that. The next morning, we were pleased to find out that our luggage had been delivered by the airline during the night, so after a quick trip downstairs to get our luggage we were ready to shower and prepare for our adventures in NYC. Well .... no washcloths, we made do for the morning, and called down to the front desk to have them bring some up when they cleaned our room. When we returned to the room later in the day to shower, and freshen up for a show we were going to see - still no wash cloths. So, I again called housekeeping, they said they would bring some up... waited for 45 minutes, and again had to make do - or miss our show. Before leaving the room, I made a call to the front desk to complain about the wash cloths - he mentioned that they were running short on these, but would try to get some up to us. Oh, and did I forget to mention, the tub would not drain, by the time you finished showering you were standing ankle deep in water. Called 3 times about this, and they toilet that nearly overflowed 3 times before someone came to work on it. By the last day we had wash clotths, a tub that would drain, and a toilet that would flush ... oh the luxuries!I did like the fact that they always asked for a room key when we would come through the door, assuring that only hotel guests gained entry. This did make me feel safer. The subway entrance/exit right outside the door was extremely convenient, once we figured out how to come out there (2 days after arrival - apparently we were walking the wrong way when we exited the train). We didn't use cabs at all while we were there, we used the subway and had no problems getting around. Because of the great location we were able to walk to time square, etc. We would ride the subway, and if it was late and we didn't want to ride the subway back to the hotel late at night (after 11:00 p.m.), we were very comfortable walking to the hotel. The hotel was clean, the staff was very courteous, I felt safe, but the small inconveniences of the washcloths, tub and toilet issues made our stay frustrating, and less than great. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room - on the go constantly, but we did expect to have the basics, and have them in working order when we were in the room."
225,1894,"Jul 16 2006	great location poor service!!!	I stayed at the Radisson Martinique from June 28-June 30, 2006. When I made my reservation, I made it through the Holiday Inn/Priority Club website and was under the impression it was a Holiday Inn hotel. However, when the cab pulled up at the entrance, I saw the signs being changed from Holiday Inn to Radisson. Prior to my arrival, I was never even notified that such a change was occurring, as I would've stayed somewhere else since I only booked that hotel to receive my Priority Club points. In any event, the hotel was changing over to the Radisson the day I arrived. When I went to the check in desk, I was told their computer system was down because they were changing over to the Radisson and to check back at 4:00. So, at 4:00, I checked back and was told again that the computer system was not ready. By this time, there was a line of people that was getting rather irritated at the fact that the hotel's computers were not working. The people behind the desk kept telling everyone to be patient. I'm sorry, but the hotel and the Radisson should've taken into account that switching over computer systems during the hotels check in time was not the best idea. As it was getting closer to 5:00, I was very tempted to get my luggage and try looking for another hotel. I really believed that we would never get into our room. Finally, the computers were up. When I got up to the desk, I was told that our room was ready, but it was a smoking room, even though my reservation clearly stated &quot;two double beds non-smoking.&quot; The guy at the counter checked his computer and told me there were no non-smoking rooms available. After going back and forth with him for a bit, he checked with the manager on duty. Minutes later, a non-smoking room appeared on his computer. He told us the room would have a great view. So, once we finally got into the room, it was rather small, but quiet. I was excited to see this &quot;great view&quot;, but it was really hard to see out the very DIRTY windows. (See the picture I attached to this review) I've stayed in lots of hotels and have never seen windows this dirty before. The room was clean, but there were stains on the comforters/sheets. The next day, we went out in the morning for breakfast, went shopping, and got back in our room around 2:00. We hoped that housekeeping wouldve been through with our room, but as soon as we opened the door, housekeeping hadn't even touched the room yet. I've never stayed in a hotel where housekeeping came that late in the day. So, I tried to call the front desk from my room phone to see if housekeeping was planning on coming up since we needed new towels, but I got a message saying the mailbox I requested was full. Then I tried housekeeping and got the same message. Then I proceeded to go downstairs to the front desk. The manager on duty called housekeeping and said they'd be on our floor around 3:30-4:00. I explained that we really only needed new towels. Ten minutes later, some guy who worked at the hotel delivered our towels, but told us he couldn't locate any washcloths. Then, shortly after he gave us our towels, a lady from housekeeping knocked and told us the hotel had no washcloths available. Come on, this is supposed to be a hotel! How can they not have washcloths??? Needless to say, we never saw a housekeeper on our floor for the rest of the day. Another thing that was rather annoying was how the employees would knock on the door, even when the do not disturb sign was on the door. At one point, two employees wanted to come in so they could replace any Holiday Inn markings with new Radisson ones. Then, there was the woman who came around and had to ask if when we were checking out because their computers were down yet again. Overall, this hotel was far from worth the $276 a night I paid. For $276, I expect good service, housekeeping, washcloths, and clean windows! The location is pretty much the only good thing this hotel has to offer; it's close to Macy's, the Manhattan Mall, Greeley Square, the Empire State Building, Penn Station, and Madison Square Garden. Perhaps, this hotel only had problems because they were changing ownership, but that's really no excuse. The hotel and the employees should've been more prepared as to how to handle the hotel and its guests during the change from the Holiday Inn to the Radisson. So, if good service is the last thing on your list of priorities when it comes to choosing a hotel, then the Radisson Martinique is probably just right for you. However, I recommend checking elsewhere before reserving a room here!"
226,1894,"Jul 10 2006 	Don't stay here.	First of all, this hotel is a RADISSON now, not a Holiday Inn (same parent company, they decided to re-brand the hotel I guess).I'm CURRENTLY in my hotel room here on business travel. It's in mid-town Manhattan, so yes, the location is good. However, I've got nothing else good to stay about the hotel.The check-in staff was absolutely horrible at handling stressful situations (such as people at the front desk AND a phone call! Oh my!). After waiting 20 minutes to check in (there were only 3 people in front of me, and 2 employees checking people in, what could have taken so long???), it took another 10 minutes just to complete the check-in process. The guy's attention span was that of a gnat - he'd get a phone call and run off for several minutes at a time.I get to my room, which is VERY small for a Radisson/Holiday Inn, and I've only got a single TWIN bed! What brand-name top-tier hotel doesn't have at least QUEEN beds these days? Not this one, because a queen wouldn't have fit in the room.The wireless internet is SLOW and I'm experiencing severe packet loss (I'm in IT). Almost completely useless. I'll be going to a t-mobile hotspot at Starbucks to get my work done tomorrow.The TV isn't very clear either.... bad reception on the cable line?I stayed at the Hilton Times Square last time I was here in NYC 3 weeks ago- The Hilton had a BETTER location, BIGGER rooms, BETTER beds, BETTER staff, and was $20 cheaper. I will not be staying here again."
227,1894,Jun 27 2006	OK at best	Only thing good here is the location. Not worth the money .front desk very ???????? . try to check in early reply &quot;come back at four &quot; that was it she just walked away . The conseage told me there was room ready he was very helpful and got me a room at 1pm after a good tip Room was not that clean but ok for 2 star hotelDont try look out of the window of your room there is so much dirt on them you cant see out ... See my pictures
228,1894,"Jun 27 2006 	Brilliant location nothing wrong with this place!	Just one block from the Empire State Building, this hotel is perfectly located for both business and pleasure. Cabs are pretty cheap in NYC and this hotel means most of the places you want to go are within 30 mins walk.Rooms are pretty adequate and, from what I remember a little more spacious than those of the Holiday Inn Downtown/Soho. Decor is dull, but that's pretty standard for a USA Holiday Inn. Staff are very efficient and the diner is good for breakfast."
229,1894,"Jun 27 2006	loved the location	my 2 teenaged children and i stayed in the holiday inn martinque on broadway from june 20 to june 23--it was a great location--due to the fact that we were depending on public transportation it was perfect- the subway was right outside the hotel and penn station was a few blocks away---the staff at the hotel were terrific--we were always asking for directions --micheal who worked in the lobby was great-- he directed us to restaurants--scheduled cabs for us and always helped us out with directions with the subway--the doorman that worked during the day( i don't remember his name) was very personable,funny, and always made sure we were going in the right direction-being a mom alone in the big city with 2 children was scary but the staff at the hotel made me feel right at home---our room was always clean with plenty of towels and hot water- we were in a regular room-small but adequate- nothing luxurious but we had cable and the ventilation was excellent- if you'regoing to spend alot of time in your room you would want something much bigger with more accomadations- but this was fine when you're doing alot of sightseeing and really just needing a place to sleep---the restaurant that was attached was very good-we ate there one afternoon-their servings were large and they had great desserts--their fruit dessert with fresh kiwi and srawberries was divine"
230,1894,"Jun 2 2006	Great Location but place could have been nicer	The location can't be beat - you come up out of Penn Station on 32nd and it's right in front of you! Room size was also large - rare for an NYC room. Walls are a bit thin, there's a mini bar instead of a fridge, our bathroom wasn't as clean as it should have been - one washcloth had someone's fresh makeup on it and the 2nd day they didn't leave us any washcloths! The elevators are teeny and room smelled a bit musty. A plus is that they do have free wireless internet in the rooms. I give it an A for location, a C for cleanliness/comfort. I have in much nicer hotels for the same price, but they were all the way up by the UN Plaza. I will only stay here again if I cannot get a better price at another hotel."
231,1894,"Jun 1 2006	Good hotel price and location	Having read the reviews about the cheaper hotel round the corner that I had originally booked to stay in, I cancelled that one and settled on the Holiday Inn Martinique. Fantastic location, just 5 minutes walk round the corner to Macy's and the Empire State Building and near lots of subway stations so you can easily get about. Being a single traveller I felt safe walking around later in the evening. There was a fantastic deli if you turn left out the hotel and walk a block down the street - great for breakfast and bagels. The room was fine, nice bed and clean and also quiet as it was on the 15th floor. I did so much sightseeing that I only really wanted somewhere to crash and if fitted the bill perfectly. Definitely recommended if you want somewhere clean and basic to stay and the location couldn't be faulted!"
232,1894,"May 18 2006	Loved everything about this hotel	Can't say enough good things about this hotel; the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, it was close to everything. We arrived at noon and check in was at 4:00 PM, however we had no wait as they had a room available for us and we were able to check in as soon as we arrived. Check-out was 11:00 AM, we requested a later check-out and again they accommodated us. We had a room pretty close to the elevator, and never heard any nosie from the hallway. Was traveling with a girlfriend and felt very safe at this hotel, as they had Security checking people's room keys if they were going on the elevator to the rooms. Chose this hotel from an internet site and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Will definitely stay there the next time and the location is GREAT!!!!!"
233,1894,"May 10 2006	Far better than expected	We stayed in this hotel for 5 nigths during the first weekend in december, check in, check out was not heartwarming but efficient, security, bellstaff and concierge were all very freindly and offered tourist tips and tricks without us asking them - nice approach.I have worked 18 years in the hotel industry and you can take my word for it; this hotel is far better than the official rating, they might not have all the facilities and ammenities that you will find in a 4 or 5 star property and the rooms migth be a bit small, but this hotel has an unbeatable location, very clean rooms (recently refurbished), excellent housekeeping, efficient staff (not overly enthustiatic), nice toiletries from Crabtree and Evelyn and a pricetag that makes this hotel one of the best deals in Manhattan. So if you dont need slippers, lobster termidor in the middle of the night, a ballroom size room and hip desing fixture and furniture, but would like to get some value for money and a clean, safe hotel.......you should stay here.The only &quot;bad&quot; thing I can think of is the breakfast, overprized and of very poor quality (like in many hotels) - you are better of going to Cafe Europe opposite Pen Station."
234,1894,"Apr 18 2006	Great Value Great Location	Just visited NYC for the first time over the weekend of April 1st. We had the best time and can't wait to go back! It is truly the city that never sleeps. I searched the web for the best hotel deals and kept coming up short on hotels that fit our budget. A friend recommended the Martinique. It's AAA internet rate was the best I'd been able to find for a hotel in a Midtown location. It is virtually right across the street from Macy's and there is a subway entrance right on the corner. We were able to walk or ride the subway and get everywhere we wanted to go in a short time. The room was on the 15th floor and was a comfortable size with a large bathroom and two double beds. There were three of us in the room and we did not feel crowded. Looks like the hotel has been recently renovated. Lots of character for a Holiday Inn. If you get a room with 2 double beds and anyone has to share a bed I would recommend asking for a rollaway. The double beds seemed very, very small. The view out the window was just a look at another part of the building. Could not see the city. We were somewhat grateful for this because when we were in the room to sleep it was very quiet. No street noise at all.The bellman were exceptionally nice, and gave us great service in watching our belongings as our flight out did not leave until the evening.Everyone we met in NYC at TV studios, shops, restaurants, sightseeing, theaters, church and even on the subway were very friendly and gracious. Not what we expected. It was a beautiful sunny weekend and they were even out planting flowers in pots along the streets. If your are ever in NYC and need a place to go to church try Forefront Church on Lexington. They meet in a college theater and have a website. It was very contemporary and uplifting. What a great time! Thanks NYC!"
235,1894,"Apr 14 2006	Great hotel	My husband and I stayed here for 1 night in March. I was doing a marathon in Central Park the next day so we didnt get to see too much of NYC or even stay up past 9:00 Pm. The hotel was very good I thought , they had free delicious cookies at the front desk and a complimentary microwave on the 7th floor which came in handy to heat up some snacks. The best part was it was very quiet, and the beds were extremely comfortable. I had an excellent night sleep even though I was nervous about the marathon the next day. It was also in a great location, close to lots of good things."
236,1894,"Mar 13 2006	Nice Hotel Great Location	Just stayed at the Holiday Inn this weekend, March 11. The staff was wonderful and the hotel clean. It was a great location - subway station right outside of the hotel. Macy's and lots of shopping right around the corner from the hotel and two blocks from Penn Station. The only problem was had was when we went to check in at 4:40 and the hotel room wasn't ready. We had requested a non smoking room and ended up in a smoking room. The houskeeping staff cleaned the room well and sucked out all of the smoke, however when we awoke the next morning we could smell the smoke from people smoking over night. Even though we didn't get the room we had requested I would definitely stay at this hotel again!"
237,1894,"Feb 14 2006	Great Stay 	My husband and I stayed there for our 6th anniversary. When we read the reveiws for the hotel, it was horrible. Well, we decided to give a try. It was great! I had almost changed hotels. But this hotel was great! The location is great, 5 mins. away from Time Square! The people were great! Room was nice and roomy. If it's only for two people, the room is a good size for just two people. Our view was the empire stat building. Awesome at night! You won't regret staying here. Awesome place...my husband and I are going back this year and we are difently staying at this hotel again! No regrets!"
238,1894,"Jan 22 2006	Great hotel fantastic location!	We booked this hotel last minute for our trip in January (having read some damming reviews of our original hotel choice on this website!) What a stroke of luck! The room was very clean - looked like it has recently been refurbished - and felt very spacious (for 3 adults). Despite being on the front of the hotel we experienced no noise problems at night (we all slept soundly - must have been all the walking!) We knew the location was great, having stayed this area of the city before. Ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant only once as it is so much cheaper to eat at any local diner, but the food was good. Check in/out went smoothly (we arrived early but were able to check in straight away). Concierge staff very friendly, helpful and knowlegeable. Would definitely stay here again!"
239,1894,"Jan 17 2006	Cold cold cold	Returned yesterday from this hotel. What may have been a decent hotel stay turned out to be a FREEZING hotel stay. My husband and I checked in at 4:00 pm. Although the room was non-smoking, the hallway outside the room and the room itself reaked of cigarette smoke. When went out to bring our son ice-skating in 10 degree weather and were looking forward to coming back to our room for rest and HEAT! The room seemed a bit cold and we turned the thermostat up and went to bed. We woke up around 1:00 am to find the room absolutely FREEZING COLD! We adjusted the thermostat numerous times throughout the night to no avail. First thing in the morning we called the front desk manager - Allen and was told that the could do NOTHING about compensation as we booked through a search engine and not the hotel directly. Mind you I am a Holiday Inn priority member BUT found a cheaper rate through a search engine. The manager went to blast US for not calling in the middle of the night. Like we really wanted to wake up our son at 2:00 am, change rooms etc. etc. I find this appauling and I will NEVER stay at this location again. I gave it a shot because it had decent reviews but due to customer service and the lack of HEAT, I will NOT do it to myself again. Although I enjoyed NY I came home with a sore throat and sinus problems. Room was small but clean. I do not recommend unfortunately! Just as a note: I travel often and have stayed in our NY hotels."
240,1894,"Jan 9 2006	Great Place	This was such a great hotel to stay in and especially for my first real vacation that I had to pay for by myself. I usually stay in great places cause I am with my parents, but this place was great. It was small, but perfect for what we needed, the only problem was that the check in time was so late, but we did the will call baggage and were able to see a lot of New York and see RENT and stuff. It was clean and in a perfect location. I saw it as soon as we came out of Penn Station and that was great!! We walked from the hotel to Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and even the New York Public Library....the hotel made the trip great!!"
241,1894,"Jan 5 2006	Fantastic location	I was slightly worried about staying at this hotel after reading a few of these reviews, but I had absolutely nothing to worry about.The location was perfect. Right in the centre of NY - almost opposite Macy's. I heard no noise at all during the night - very quiet. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Concierge/Door staff were very friendly and looked after our luggage without damaging it!We rang down for extra pillows and towels when we first got into our room, and they were deliviered within 5 mins. We also booked a family room for 4 adults and got 2 double beds - nobody had to sleep on the floor!Food in the restaurant was very nice - in particular the burgers! Would definately recommend this hotel - after all you only sleep and get ready in it as there's so much to see outside!"
242,1894,"Jan 3 2006	New Year's Eve 2005/2006	Although it is a nice hotel, the staff are not as pleasant. It would go a long way to smile. The walls are so very thin, so thin that we heard every conversation next door if they talked loud enough... aka more than a whisper.You need your key to get passed security throughout the day... Safe. All in all I would reccommend - we walked about 10 blocks to times square - about a 10-15 min walk, a nice walk.Martinique cafe was a bit of a stomachache. Beds ands room were clean and housekeeing are very efficient."
243,1894,"Dec 20 2005	Smack bang in the centre of Manhattan!	Although the Holiday Inn on Martinique is not classed as a luxury hotel, it's location, large rooms, service and security more than make up for this. The subway is a mere stones throw from the front door of the hotel. In addition Times Square, 5th Avenue, Macys, Manhattan Mall and various other well known stores are easily accessible by foot from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to any potential visitor to New York wanting the most central and reasonably priced location possible. The staff are friendly and very helpful.I've stayed in this hotel on 5 seperate occasions and have not had a negative experience. I've always gotten the best rates on the Holiday Inn Website."
244,1894,"Dec 14 2005	Good Experience	My husband, myself and teenage daughter stayed at this hotel, 9/12/2005 - 13/12/2005, After reading some of the reviews on here we tried to change our hotel booking but were unable to. I am glad to say that we enjoyed our stay here, the situation was good, on broadway, close to Macys, approx 10 minute walk to Times Square,also next to the Subway. The room that we stayed in had 2 double beds and had recently been redecorated. It was clean and well maintained.We had a good view across broadway. our maid was helpful and friendly however I have to report reception staff to be less welcoming and lacking pleasantries, although we did find this to a common occurence throughout our stay in NY. On the morning of departure we had 2 people knock our door before the 11am deadline to check that we were in the process of departing. We did not appreciate this. All in all, I cannot fault the hotel, I feel that customer relations could however be improved. We stayed at the Salisbury 2 years ago and this knocked spots off it."
245,1894,"Dec 9 2005 	Great central location clean rooms!	I just got back from the Martinique, staying 12/6 - 12/7. My company booked the room and I was a little wary having never heard of it and reading some of the previous reviews. However, i didn't experience any of the pitfalls listed by previous reviewers.LOCATION: Excellent. I walked to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the Javits (all within about 15-20 mins.) Walked back from a Broadway show after 11pm and never felt unsafe.ROOM: Small but very clean. Marble bathroom looked updated. Furnishing and bedding seemed recently updated as well. No view (inner courtyard and walls) but I quickly learned that it is much quieter NOT to have a view (no sirens or honking at 3am.)SERVICE: Yes, they really do shove your bill under your door the morning you are scheduled to leave. I was very worried since my company was paying the bill that there would be problems (having read previous reviews.) When I checked in they couldn't find the faxed credit card authorization. However, the desk clerk simply had me stand to the side and resolved the matter in about 10 minutes. When I went to check out, there were no extra charges and it all went smoothly! I did check a bag for my last day with no problems. Also, the doorman was out when I was ready to leave but a bellhop hailed a cab for me to the airport.All in all a pleasant experience. Note: I'm very low maintenance when it comes to hotels. I don't order room service or expect to have my bags taken up to my room. Didn't eat at the cafe either."
246,1894,"Dec 9 2005 	Pleasant Surprise	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Martinique in early December on business. I would normally pick a non-chain boutique in the city. I chose this hotel strictly on rate since the rates in the city are astronomical at this time of the year. I booked a petite room and was not sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find the hotel and room to be just fine for my needs. The staff was friendly, the locatation was good, the rooms were nice, and I had an overall pleasant experience. I was not impressed with the restaurant, but with all the eating choices in NYC, that is not a big deal..."
247,1894,"Dec 5 2005	Perfect Place to Stay	We just got home from a long weekend in the City. We had originally booked the Portland Square, but read some pretty nasty reviews about mice and bed bugs so we decided to switch over to the Holiday Inn. From the minute we arrived we knew we had made the right decision. The door man Billy is awesome. He gave us great tips on where the shopping deals are (Steve &amp; Barry's Manhattan Mall) and helped us get cabs whenever we needed them. The staff was very friendly overall. The hotel was nice and clean. Our room on the 11th floor was large for NYC and had a modern bathroom. It seemed pretty updated and the beds were very comfortable. House keeping came every day while we were out and replaced our towels and made the beds. We felt completely safe here and would stay again. Even at 349/night in December, it's worth it."
248,1894,Dec 4 2005	Worst Hotel	I go to NYC every year. This is the worst Hotel. Rude staff. During the night while asleep the doorman was banging on my door. He was trying to deliever luggage to my room. I had checked in the day before.He had the wrong room. When I called down the tell the front desk I got cut off. They did not call back to appolize. 24 Hr. front desk ???????? Stopped up tub drain. Ice maker on 11th floor did not work. They say just go to another floor. I had to call down several times for things that should have been in the room and on one occassion I had to call twice for the same things. Never Never again holday inn. Only thing good here is the location. Not worth the money or time.
249,1894,"Nov 30 2005 	Martinique -- destroyed luggage not part of the package	Great location, serviceable rooms, but find someplace else if you plan to leave your luggage here after checking out. They must have played football with my bags, and they came out after 12 hours battered and broken. The management did not take responsibility for damages, offering only a few &quot;frequent flyer&quot; points."
250,1894,Nov 24 2005	Great base to see Manhattan	I went in with an open mind after reading the good and bad reviews. The first night we were in a room on the 4th floor that was a little cramped for our 6 night stay. We were moved with the minimum of fuss up to the 15th where we had an excellent room with more than adequate facilities. The staff were excellent and did not stand with their hands out looking for tips like other hotels in the City. The hotel is a perfect base to explore Manhattan. Couple of nice bars on 5th and a good couple of diners for breakfast a block away (again on 5th). All in all it helped us have a ball in NYC.
251,1894,"Nov 23 2005	Fabulous Hotel. Highly Recommended.	This was a fabulous hotel! I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds and huge bath towels. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. The bellman was adorable - to the point of hugging me every time he saw me (and I'm a grandmother!) Housekeeping was right on top of things every day, and if I had the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on my door, they'd call (at a reasonable time) to see if I needed anything. The location was excellent. I was traveling with an infant (2 months old), and the bellman insisted we have a refrigerator in the room because of the baby. He ended up searching through several vacant rooms until he located one for us.Ignore those other reviews about the staff being unfriendly and the rooms not being nice. This hotel is fabulous. Having traveled through every contiguous state in the US, I've stayed at lots of hotels. The Holiday Inn Martinique rates close to the top of my list."
252,1894,"Nov 8 2005	Holiday Inn is fine	Just back from 5 day stay in this hotel in New York and was quite apprehensive having read some reviews. But the hotel was absolutely fine. The room was very clean and cleaned daily while we were there. It had a coffee maker which was a god-send! My two sisters and I had booked a double room. The room we were initially allocated we found a little small, although it had a great view (on 16th floor). I went back down to reception and they immediately gave me the key to another room to have a look at. It was bigger so we took that one. This room looked inward, so had no view but, we were out all day sightseeing/shopping and were absolutely unconcerned by this. They also have a facility for storing luggage which was wonderful as we had a late flight on the day we checked out. The hotel is around the corner from Maceys on one side and the Empire State Building on the other and has a subway stop right outside. The only problem we found was finding somewhere nice to eat nearby in the evening. The resteurants in Macys were great for lunch and we tried Speedys across the road for Breakfast a couple of times and that was ok. If you like Korean resteurants there are lots of these around.New York was everything we hoped it would be. We found the people wonderfully helpful. If you have time go to the View in the Merriott hotel off Times Square for a cocktail. It's a revolving cocktail bar. The cocktail will cost about 16 dollars but the view as you slowely turn is absolutely magnificent."
253,1894,"Nov 2 2005	Great stay at the Martinique	We stayed at the Martinique three nites, from 10/26 to 10/29. I had booked the hotel thru Priceline. At check-in, the clerk moved us up from a room with a full size bed to a room with a queen on the top (18th) floor. The room was a very comfortable size for Manhatten, and while not a sweeping vista view of the skyline, there was still something to see. Everything was clean and comfortable. The mid-town location was great, two blocks from Macy's, one block from the Empire State building, walking distance to Times Square, and a subway station entrance just outside the front door. The only real complaint I had was that being on the top floor, there was some machinery on the roof that we could hear at all hours (I think a fan of some kind), but it did not keep me from getting a good nights sleep. I would stay there again, and recommend it to a friend."
254,1894,"Oct 22 2005	hated the cafe	cold food, horrible service, and 20% service charge! an awful experience."
255,1894,"Oct 20 2005	Excellent value and location!	This place is a gem, I found a very good internet rate so 3 of us headed for NYC. We had 2 double beds and a free rollaway (It was like a real bed, not a cot) Room was quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Would stay here again in a minute!"
256,1894,"Oct 19 2005	Worst hotel in New York	I am an English journalist and had the misfortune to stay in the Martinique as part of a press trip. Having visited New York several times on varying budgets, I can honestly say this must be one of the worst hotels in the city. The rooms are dingy and horrible enough, but it is the complete lack of customer service skills that ensures this pit of a place stands out from other midtown accomodation for all the wrong reasons.My partner and I had several reasons to complain over the 2 nights we stayed here, but even telling the front desk I was a journalist writing an article on the hotel failed to ignite any customer service skills.I would urge people not to book this hotel as a stay here will taint your view of an amazing city that generally treats visitors with warmth. Instead try the Affinia which is cheaper but leagues above the Martinique in both style and service."
257,1894,Oct 12 2005	cramped roomone double bed	I reserved this room through Hotwire. It was advertised as a three star hotel. I believe it is a two star hotel. The room was the size of a walk in closet. There was one small double bed. The room was dark and dank. My husband and I tried the restaurant because it was pouring rain outside. The food was luke warm and there were flies buzzing around our food. The only thing this hotel has going for it is its' proximity to Madison Square Garden. I would not stay here again.
258,1894,"Oct 3 2005 	Exceeded expectations - very pleasant stay	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Martinique Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30. This was my first trip to NYC and involved an important meeting, so I was a little high strung and had questions and special requests. The bellman team arranged for my transportation to the conference and to the airport and luggage storage during the day. The concierge took care of dinner recommendations, reservations and directions and touring advice. The room was prettier than the on-line photographs - crown molding, room with a view, very clean, tasteful carpet, decor and bed linens - &quot;cherry&quot; furniture, pale yellow walls and blue carpet, upholstery and bed spread. It was also bigger than I expected with a full-size bed, a large arm chair and ottoman for lounging, a desk and open space. (Note: Holiday Inn reservations listed the bed as Full, but the actual hotel lists the bed as Queen.) The bathroom was small but was very clean and appeared to be recently renovated. My bill was delivered that morning, under the door. The walls are thin, but the A/C provided noise cover. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but it is a very cute diner with retro decoration. The Korean restaurant next door offers good service and very reasonable prices. As female traveling alone, I felt safe. I would recommend staying at the Holiday Inn Martinique if you are looking for a mid-price hotel, especially if you want to be near the theatre district. The service was personalized when I needed it to be and professional during my entire stay."
259,1894,"Aug 24 2005 	Loved it!	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Broadway for 2 nights. The staff was extremely friendly, the room was very nice and clean. I got a superb rate $138 for 2 nights (Thurs &amp; Fri) on hotels The bathroom was a decent size with a bath tub, which was also very clean. The beds were very comfy. Location was just superb, I was close to almost everything I wanted to see. I will definately stay here each time I visit NY."
260,1894,"Aug 9 2005	Do Not Stay at this Hotel	Our stay at this Holiday Inn was a nightmare from check-in to check-out. I was travelling with two friends - all of us worked in the hotel industry. I was a hotel receptionist and my two friends were concierges. When we made our booking, we did it over the internet. We received confirmation for a room with two double beds. Knowing how the system works, we triple-checked the website for any terms and conditions such as extra person charges, requests being non-guaranteed etc.We found no such wording on the website. We also contact the hotel directly prior to arriving to confirm the room type once again. On arrival we were quite upset when we were checked into a room with one double bed. We were eventually given a roll-away as well (which we were charged for!) and my friend who is 7 feet tall was expected to sleep in it with his legs hanging out the end.Our room was dirty, very smelly from cigarette smoke, and it was so dark that we couldnt tell whether it was day or night outside (we had a view of a brick wall).The next day we were moved to a room with two double beds. This room was also dirty and there were several things that were broken in the room. The most annoying of these was the toilet which overflowed on several occasions.The main purpose of a hotel is to provide clean and comfortable accommodation. This hotel does not provide either.The staff were so rude and unhelpful that they actually made me feel ashamed to be a part of the hotel industry myself."
261,1894,"Jul 22 2005	At the right price this is the right place	Booked at a discount, and was pleased. Great location--also good if you have someone at the NYU hospitals. Stayed 3 nites. Room was not made up on one day--MLK holiday may've had something to do with that. Staff helpful. Good eats nearby--especially the Brooklyn Bagel deli. Cheapest souvenirs in town at the end of the block (east). Would not pay $350 a nite to stay here, but if you can get it for $l50 or less, its good. Good security, near Penn Station."
262,1894,"Jul 17 2005	reasonable rates great location nice staff	I'm not sure why there are that many negative reviews. My wife and I and our 15 year old son stayed there for one week this July and couldn't have been more pleased. The hotel lobby is small and doesn't exactly beckon one to hang out there, but our hotel room provided more than adequate space, was clean and well maintained daily. I wonder about the negative review I read on this site that complained about the &quot;small room.&quot; The room is average in size for this price category, and I would challenge that writer to find me a hotel room any bigger for the same price. The carpet looked fairly new, and the bathroom fixtures and tile had a new appearance as well. The bar off the lobby is well lit and is tastefully designed with contemporary decor. The drinks were a bit pricey, but show me a bar in NYC where they're not. All the staff with whom we had interactions were quite nice and helpful, especially Tom, the doorman, who gave us several good tips for dining. The central location in Midtown was the perfect area for getting around town. The subway entrance is twenty paces from the hotel's front door. The ESB is one block away, Macy's is two blocks, Times Saquare is a ten minute walk. We walked to Times Square and back three times, night and day, and never felt unsafe or threatened. The neighborhood around the hotel feels safe and is quite busy on weekdays and nights. There are a few homeless who may be seen hanging out in the park across the street, but never did anyone harrass us on those mornings we had our morning coffee there.Overall we had a fantastic stay in NYC. And it's not just this hotel that shoots that myth about the rude New Yorker all to hell. Throughout our week there, we had perhaps thirty, forty, maybe fifty interactions with new Yorkers, and not one of them was less than pleasant. Tourist guides will tell you not to openly read a map on the streets, lest a predator approach you. But quite the opposite happened. Local people approached us and warmly offefered their help with directions. What a great city and what a nice hotel! We would most definitely stay at this hotel again."
263,1894,"Jul 14 2005	Not exactly what we were expecting	I booked a trip to NYC for my wife's and my 5th wedding anniversary. We had originally booked another hotel with an online travel agency. This other hotel had gotten very good reviews for its big rooms and convenient location. We got put in the Holiday Inn Martinique by our reservation company when our the hotel of our initial reservation turned out to be full. The agency's policy when a confirmed reservation cannot in fact be confirmed is to put the guest in an equal or better hotel, so we were quite shocked when we saw our room - a 10'x10' smoking room with a very small double bed that the hotel assured us was queen size. We had been told by our reservation company that the Holiday Inn was a beautiful 4-star hotel so we had not contested the change, but when we got there we were very disappointed. The hotel staff did try their best to get us in a bigger bed but they were booked to capacity, so the best they could do is give us 2 single beds in a non-smoking room, and the next night moved us to a non-smoking room with 2 double beds - not exactly the way we were planning on spending our anniversary. The reservation company did nothing to try to offer us something better except call the front desk of the hotel and give us the same response the front desk had given us.Anyway the hotel was not really at fault, but it was a little disappointing that the rooms were not as nice as we expected. I don't mean to be too picky, but the comforter on the bed and one of the towels had stains on them, something you would not expect to see from such an establishment.The only redeeming factor was the staff, which did try their best to find us a better room and helped us move all our bags around. They also let us keep our bags in the hotel after we checked out so we could do a little more sightseeing."
264,1894,"Jun 28 2005	not treated fairly	we stayed in early june at the holday inn Martinque. We hated it. reserved are rooms over 6 weeks in advance for 2 double beds, when we got to our room it was 2 single beds there was 5 of us. they where suppose to send up roll away beds they never arravied. only gave us 20.00 off our price of the room. big deal we had kids sleeping on the floor. never got any extra towels we asked for. not a very customer satisfation program going on there for a holiday inn. will never stay there again!"
265,1894,"Jun 25 2005	Hated it	I stayed here over Memorial Weekend with a friend. We had requested 2 double beds when we made the reservation on line but when we arrived at the hotel we were told none were available....unless we wanted to pay a $75 a night surcharge. Of course we paid it but this is not the way to run a hotel. Although our room was allegedly non-smoking, it reeked of stale cigarette smoke. The air conditioning worked but never really cooled off the room to a satisfactory level. The cafe was adequate but the service was extremely slow.The best thing I can say is the hotel is conveniently located. The bellmen and doormen were very helpful but the rest of the staff was lacking. I would not stay here again."
266,1894,"Jun 6 2005	Memorial Weekend	My husband and I had a good experience at this hotel! It's funny to read the other not so good reviews when we had a nice clean room, very quiet. It looked like it had been painted and new everything not so long ago. We liked having the cafe right downstairs and the nice bar as well. But we had to move here from the Red Roof Inn because it was a dump, our room smelled like an ashtray. They didn't seem to care so at 2 in the morning we luckily found a room at the Holiday Inn down the street. The hotel is so close to some good sites...Macy's, the Empire State building, Penn Station and not so far, Times Square. So we hope you have good luck like we did!"
267,1894,"May 25 2005	Our nickname is The Dump	We got stuck staying here for work a few times as a co-worker negotiated a good rate, this was before we had stayed there though. We've stayed at a lot of Holiday Inn's, the one in Toronto being particularly nice. Jowever the NYC ones leave a LOT to be desired. After staying in this one, our team nicknamed this hotel &quot;the Dump&quot; for good reason. I am a Platinum Priority Club member and got rooms which smelled like stale cigarettes, had burns in the carpet, big hole in the comforter and such. One co-worker had the peephole on her door missing and all that was in its place was some tissue paper stuck in the hole. Twice two of us got back to our rooms after dinner (around 9pm) and they had not been serviced at all. One co-worker had no towels in his room and had to call repeatedly to get some. On a Friday when about to check out, I found my bill in the hallway(not under my door) which had all my personal and credit card data on it, including name, address, full credit card # and expiration date. I noted others in the hall too so went and notified the front desk, who didn't seem to care one iota about the risk of identity theft / credit card fraud of such information being available to anyone who would pick up the bill. Basically the place is awful, and I refuse to ever stay there again along with most of our team, especially the females as it doesn't appear the safest either."
268,1894,"May 24 2005 	Do Not book this hotel	I was booked into Holiday Inn Martinique in May 2005 by the company I work for, on a business trip, with a number of other colleagues.As I checked in, I was told the money had not yet been settled, so I was to give them my own credit card just as security. When it came to check out, the balance had still not quite been finalised, but the hotel told us all that they would not bill our individual credit cards, but wait for the money to be finally settled by the agency involvedWhen I returned home they had taken the money from all of our credit cards for our entire stay, even when they assured us they would not.Also beware of the minibar. It is electrically tagged, so even if you even touch an item, but decide not to buy it, you will be billed, and it is difficult to sort it out with the staff who I found to be surly and unhelpfulI extended my stay in New York for a few more days - just 2 minutes walk away on the same road at the Red Roof Inn, for about $90 (or 50 a night) less. It was cheaper, and so much better, clean and basic, but with lovely helpful staffTo conclude: Do NOT book the Holiday Inn Martinique , whilst the rooms are not unpleasant, you can get better value elsewhere with better customer service"
269,1894,"May 20 2005	Nightmare	Just returned from a trip to New York and thanks to my stay in the Holiday Inn my holiday was not the exciting time I expected it to be.... On arrival at the hotel, where we stayed for two nights, we payed for the first night, and a deposit for the second night and were told it would be ok to pay the balance when checking out....On we go to the room, where the toiliet was blocked and a light broken and the room not vacumed. Now the light and dirty carpet you could get over but no toilet... not so easy to do without.... The problem with the toilet was sorted but the light never fixed.On the morning we were due to check out at 11am, we got a very early unasked for wake up call from two security men at 7.30am, demanding the balance for the room. Is this the norm in New York??? I was shocked. They would not give us five minutes to get dressed and come down to pay, we had to be escorted down by 2 men who were very unpleasant to say the least. For a moment I thought it was a jail I had booked into with the treatment we received from these men. Now it was bad enough been woken up and brought down to pay but when we got back to the room I realised that we had been overcharged. When I went down to get my money back I had to sign so many forms, as though it were a mistake on my part. I complained to the manager about the whole episode and I am sure if I were standing in front of him to this day I would still be waiting from him to say sorry. I was never treated so badly in all my life. Looking back on the website it makes me laugh to read about the service claimed to be provided by this hotel. It is far from what they are suggesting. They should review their website or else review the actual service provided in their hotel. Thanks to my experience in the Holiday Inn on Broadway, I will never go to New York again"
270,1894,"May 19 2005 	Overnighter	I stayed for one night. It did the job. Good location. Room was well kept. I was given the wrong room key, tried to call to have one brought up, or tell me where my key worked. Nope. Against security policy."
271,1894,"May 15 2005	Martinique is okay but a terrific value!	We stayed at the Hotel Martinique (a Holiday Inn of sorts) purely on a fluke. My husband and I don't do a lot of planning for the many trips we take each year. We typically like to just show up, in town, and drive around 'til we find a place that looks acceptable. We have done this countless times and it has never failed. (On the contrary, some of the hotels I've only seen on the Internet have turned out to be quite shabby, when viewed in person.)We left Washington, DC on a multi-destination driving trip, on our way to NYC with our dog. At our DC hotel, we downloaded a few hotel options from the Internet, to my laptop. One by one I called for a reservation and, one by one, we were told the hotel wouldn't accpet dogs or a dog her size. (Like there's a difference. ...Losers.) We then began thumbing through a pet-friendly hotel guide a friend had given us. Even with that, we still had difficulty. You see, we don't want to stay just anywhere. We usually stay at 5 star hotels. When that's not possible, we lower our standards enough to find the best available hotel.Yet, again and again, we were told the pet-friendly information listed was incorrect; hadn't been updated and, ultimately, the hotel would not allow our dog to stay in a room with us.We had pretty much given up, and started planning to skip NYC this time, when I tried what I felt was a &quot;hail Mary&quot; call. I called the Hotel Martinique on Broadway (despite it's 3 star rating), and couldn't believe it when I was told they welcome pet guests and, not only that, the rate was just $99/night! We were dumbfounded...and more than a bit concerned. We were veeerrrryyyy skeptical about what we'd find when we arrived, given the room rate for downtown Manhattan.What we did find was a perfectly acceptable high-rise hotel. Nothing glorious, but worth about $180/night, at least.The location can't be beaten. It's right on Broadway, and close to many attractions.We actually tried to stay there on a subsequent trip, but the hotel refused to confirm a non-smoking room for us when we booked, and then unequivocally refused to try to accommodate us with a non-smoking room, even if we waited for one to be cleaned, etc.[I hate to be nit-picky, but there is just one (glaring) drawback to their, otherwise, welcoming pet policy. A hotel staff member must physically go check your room before you're allowed to check out. This makes the checkout procedure quite lengthy and tedious. It is very insulting that I, an affluent, educated woman, who teaches responsible dog ownership and &quot;travel with pets etiquette&quot; would be presumed guilty of the kinds of problems they're looking for.(On the other hand, I'm so pleased to know that not a single human guest has ever caused any kind of damage that went undiscovered until after the guest had checked out, in the history of the hotel. How unique the Hotel Martinique is, in that regard. Because from my experience, far more human guests cause problems than pet guests. But hey, that's just me: A rational, reasonable person with expertise in the area of hotel pet policy, and an impeccably behaved, scrupulously clean, and loved pet. Far be it for me to demand to be held accountable for my OWN actions, and not the negligence of people I don't even know, and who keep their pets in ways I find abhorrent. Again, I congratulate the Hotel Martinique for having such a spotless record with their human guests, that only guests with pets are singled out for this extra scrutiny.)]If you don't mind being presumed guilty, then I would recommend this hotel for pet owners. It's one of the few &quot;pet-friendly&quot; hotels in the area. (We did pop into the Ritz-Carlton, to inquire about their pet policy. We were told they would readily welcome our whole family, without restriction. So, we will probably stay there on the next trip to NYC with our pooch.) We have also stayed at the W Hotel - New York - Tuscany, which &quot;accepts&quot; dogs up to 80lbs, but readily made &quot;an exception&quot; for us. The various W Hotels are also another option for pet travellers.The only real drawback for dog owners is the lack of nearby green space for elimination. (Always, always, always clean up after your pet, please.) I was told there was an &quot;off-leash park&quot; several blocks south of the hotel. However, it is NOTHING like the off-leash parks in most cities. My thought was, 'Why even bother?' It is a tiny, fenced-in section of a small park, with gravel footing that was quite painful for my dog's sensitive feet. In my city, there are about 20 off-leash parks, and they're all huge grassy fields, most have wooded trails, and not one is fenced. I couldn't believe my eyes when I discovered what passed for an &quot;off-leash dog park.&quot; But hey, we were in Manhattan. Seriously, just go to Central Park for off-leash time, and find a strip of public grass for leashed potty breaks.Hotel Martinique is a very good value, and is a relatively good option for pet travellers."
272,1894,"Apr 19 2005	great hotel	Stayed for a week, great value for money, good location. Upgraded room two double beds, loads of space, good size bathroom. Read reveiws before hand a bit nervous because some reveiws were bad, found hotel to be fine not a problem don't now what some people were on about. Room was clean and tidy, fresh towels and cleaned everyday. Hotel by Macy's and Empire State building about a 10 minute walk to Time Square. Would stay again. Found staff fine didn't have to queue when checked in, found staff fast, efficient and friendly. Booked a non smoking room and recevied a non smoking room, did email to double check booking and responded quickly within a hour."
273,1894,"Apr 14 2005 	Don't stay	For the price i paid at holiday inn martinique i expected better. On arrival lobby looked great. Downhill from there on........ Check in staff very rude and abrupt. Asked for non smoking room which was what was booked when reservation made. told no room avail. after arguing for a bit given a non smoking room. The room was TINY, no closet, no space for my bags, had to jump over them everytime came/ left room. aircon very noisy and rattled all night. On first night came back at 22h00 to unserviced room and neighbours room service tray was lying outside my door for 2 days untill i requested it me moved. then had to wait 1/2 hour for them to come service room, again staff very unhelpfull and rude. telephone system not properly working, called housekepping and got through to front desk ect ect. Also messages not given. All in all a most unpleasant stay."
274,1894,"Mar 28 2005	Don't believe the negative reviews!	I stayed at the Martinique while on a March Break shopping trip with a friend. When I tried to book on Expedia several weeks in advance, all hotels within the Manhattan area were either booked solid for the two weeks that most schools were out for Spring Break, or were charging extremely jacked-up prices. I was getting ready to pay approximately $130 Canadian for a room in a very dubious-looking budget hotel outside of the main city area when an opening came up at the Martinique, $160 CAN/night for a &quot;petite room&quot; with two twin beds. Since there were only two of us and we didn't really care about bed size, that sounded perfect - expensive compared to what you'd pay for a hotel in Toronto, but it *was* March Break and hotels in NYC are expensive at all times of year.We got to the hotel two hours before check-in time and were given our room right away even though we'd expected to have to check our bags and come back at 4 p.m. to check in. The room was very clean and well-equipped - good lighting, coffee machine, iron and ironing board, TV, minibar, safe, etc. The only problem with the room was that the hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work, but it didn't matter because we'd brought a hairdryer with us anyhow. We didn't eat any meals in the hotel, but we did use the business centre on the basement floor once to check email - it's convenient to use, but you can access the Internet cheaper at one of the cafes across the street. Our room was cleaned daily and by the time we returned to the hotel after shopping each day everything was tidy and new towels, etc. were in place for the night. The hotel staff were quite helpful with getting us taxis and held our bags for us after checkout time on our last day in the city until we left for the airport several hours after the 11 a.m. checkout.The best part about the hotel was LOCATION. There is a subway stop right outside the door of the hotel, and there is great shopping within seconds - Manhattan Mall, Sephora, Macy's, H&amp;M, Victoria's Secret, etc. It is a short walk to Times Square and if you take the time to figure out the subway lines, all corners of the city are easily accessible from this spot. The hotel is in Koreatown and many cafes and restaurants in the area are open 24 hours for those who want a bite to eat after coming home from the theatre or concerts late at night. Overall, the place is definitely not a luxury hotel - if you want to honeymoon in NYC or plan to spend a lot of time in the hotel, pay extra and stay elsewhere - but for a sightseeing or shopping trip, it is a lovely place to stay and can't be beat in terms of location and price. I'll definitely stay there again!"
275,1894,"Mar 25 2005	OUTSTANDING!!!!Location is everything!!	I booked this hotel thru hotels.com,We got a great price @ $148.00 a night. We stayed there from March 21-25 2005. After doing hours of reasearch for a hotel in NY that was in a great location, CLEAN, a great value etc.... I finally settled on The Holiday Inn Martinque. After I booked it I read a few reviews that were not always positive so I was a little nervous to stay there. We arrived at the hotel at 12 noon and check in wasn't until 4pm. At first I was told that there was not a room available before 3pm. When I told her how tired we were from a very long trip there she looked again and found a room for us! We wer able to check in and go to our room immediately, what a blessing! We did not have to wait long to check in and the front desk staff were very friendly. Our room was a standard room with 2 double beds and was surprisingly bigger than I thought it would be. It was perfect for My daughter and I and my friend and her daughter. Our room was one of the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed in and I tried hard to find something that was not clean. The 1st night we got back to our room about 9:30pm and realized we need more blankets, towels, pillows, shampoo and a few other things. When we called houskeeping they sent someone up immediately with the things we wanted even though we did not let them know everything all at once. They came up 3 times in a 1/2 hour, always with a smile! The doormen were very helpful, it was great that they always checked that you had a room key before they would let you in. A real perk was the little gift shop in the back of the hotel on the main floor. The prices were amazingly reasonable. If I had to find a fault with the hotel, the only thing I could even think of was that the water pressure in the shower was not as strong as I like. I could definately live with that!! The hotel was in the best location possible and very convient for ANY place we wanted to go. The subway was right out our door, Penn station just 1 1/2 blocks down, Macy's 1 block, empire state building 1-2 blocks and we actually walked to times square and back a few times! (about a 20-25 min walk) We also walked to The Today show, NBC studios etc..... If I ever get the pleasure to visit NY again, I will Definately be staying at the Holiday Inn Martinque!"
276,1894,"Mar 24 2005	Superb Location	My first ( of many I hope ) trip to New York and stayed at the Holiday Inn Martinique on Broadway. Superb location and service and the doorman William proved to be a bundle of information.The hotel is around the corner from Maceys, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens and a host of fine Deli's, fine eating places and Irish Bars .Taxi's will take you to any part of Mannhatten within a short space of time and are really inexpensive.All in, a superb base to visit New York"
277,1894,"Mar 19 2005	Great location	We stayed for 3 nights, booking 3 rooms during a family vist to New York in Feb 05. Booked the rooms through Hotel Anywhere at a good price of 63 per night. The checkin was fast and efficient with friendly staff. The rooms do vary in size and view, some looking on to an internal courtyard, but the staff were happy to change rooms, you may not be so lucky in peak periods.The location is great, Empire State just around the corner, Macy's just across the road and good subway connections to Central Park and Battery Park for Ellis Island etc.I've now used this hotel twice and would certainly go for a third visit."
278,1894,"Mar 10 2005	Two Thumbs Up!	This was our first trip to NYC and we booked our stay through hotwire.com. We were a little nervous about trying this service as you don't know the name of the hotel until after you pay for it, but were pleased to find out that the Holiday Inn Martinique was where we'd be staying. We got an amazing deal of $99/night through hotwire.I called the hotel directly after booking through hotwire and spoke to Anna. She was very pleasant and informed me we were booked for a &quot;full size&quot; bed but mentioned I could ask at the front desk to upgrade the bed on our arrival in NY.We arrived Sunday, Feb 27, 2005 for 4 nights and were greeted by Emmanuel, another extremely pleasant hotel employee. We asked if it were possible to upgrade to a queen size bed and he said there'd be &quot;no problem&quot; and then asked us if we'd like a King size bed. Ummm... YES!!!There is a parking garage across the street from the hotel which has discounted rates for hotel guests when you validate the ticket they give you. I think the rate was $27 per 24 hour period. It ended up cheaper than we'd planned.We were on the third floor (Room 308) at the end of the hall. Very quiet. The room was quite roomy for what we expected a NYC hotel room to be. It was VERY clean and comfy with a mini-bar and in-room safe (which we didn't use). The room had a large window, albeit looking out into a dark alley so we kept the curtains drawn.The location of this hotel was excellent. We were 1-1/2 blocks from the Empire State Building, about 1 block from Macy's and across the street from the Manhatten Mall, 10 blocks from Times Square. There was a subway entrance right beside the hotel front doors or if you needed a different subway line you could walk a couple blocks to Penn Station. We got the Metrocard ($7 each per day) which allowed us to go all over the city and come back &quot;home&quot; to drop off parcels as need be.Our first trip to NYC was a huge success and in part to our stay at this hotel. The only complaint (if you could call it that) was regulating the heat in our room. There was a thermostat in the room but the last 24 hours of our stay we found it hard to get the room &quot;toasty&quot; warm (which I like). It wasn't cold, but the heater seemed to be blowing cool air out of the fan. It didn't hamper our trip though as we were barely in the room and my husband enjoys the temperature abit cooler. Also, the weather was bitter cold outside so that could have had something to do with it.This was a great hotel with friendly staff and great amenities. If you want a hotel near all the attractions without being in the heart of Times Square (and paying tons of $$), this is the place! We'd go back again!"
279,1894,"Feb 23 2005	Great Hotel Good Location	I stayed for three nights in February 2005 and was very impressed with the hotel. It was clean and security was very good. But the best thing of all was the location. Right in the heart of New York, 2 blocks from the Empire State Building. The only drawback I would say is that we had two kids (11,9) and the double bed was quite small for the two of them to fit into. Having said that would go back there again."
280,1894,"Feb 19 2005	Outstanding place	We stayed one night in early February and it was a great spot. Good security at the door, parking right across the street for only $27 validated at the hotel. The rooms were good, the place was nice and clean and the staff were all pleasant and helpful. This is a great spot to stay in the city with the Empire State building one block over and Times Square and the theater district only a 10 mintue walk away. I'd highly recommend this property and next time I'm in the city I'll be staying there again. You can't go wrong with this Holiday Inn."
281,1894,"Feb 7 2005	Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent	Stayed for two nights in January. Quick, friendly checkin, room in perfect order, comfortable bed. I'd stay again. Good price, good location."
282,1894,"Jan 27 2005	Fantastic Location	After reading previous reviews I was also a bit wary of what to expect. Arrived on the 13 January for 5 nights before check in and was pleased to be told the room was ready. We were in the 5th floor in room 523 and whilst the room wasnt overly big it was adequate for what we needed and it overlooked broadway, the noise could be heard when you opened the windows but closed with the air conditioning on you couldnt tell what was outside. The reports about the walls being thin and noisy worried me but we didnt hear a thing (might be something to do with being so tired after long days!) Didnt eat in the hotel, went to the american burger co for breakfast a few times and you must go for sunday brunch to Isabellas on W77th street, fantastic and really cheap considering the standard! Times Square was about 10 mins walk up broadway, ESB round the block, Penn Station a block away and a metro line just outside. Didnt really use the hotels facilities, being in New York we didnt want to stay in the hotel! But couldnt fault it when we needed something. Checkout time said 11 on one notice and 12 on another. We left some shopping untuil the last minute and only checked out about 12.30 but the staff didnt say anything. The maid must have had heart attacks when she saw our shopping bags in the room! Overall, I would say the location is the best thing about this hotel, would definitely go back just for where it is. Other maybe nicer hotels nearer to central park look nice (also have not so nice prices!) but unless I had money to burn I wouldnt bother as it would take longer to get to places. Also try Rauls a french bistro between thompson and sullivan st in Soho, we managed to get a table about 6pm on saturday and it was gorgeous."
283,1894,Jan 23 2005	Great Location Highly Recommended	Arrived 15th January and despite concerns with our reservation for a few minutes (which were quickly resolved) were given a room on the 16th floor (unfortuately at the back so no views). The room was clean and tidy perfect for a five night stay. The location was fantastic just two blocks from Penn Station which was handy for coming in from Newark airport. Times Square was 15 minutes walk and the ESB was just round the corner. On the corner was a subway entrance handy for further journeys on the R/W lines. We had problems with the coffee machine which we reported one morning and on our return later that day the machine was working again. We would definitley use this hotel again whilst visiting New York.
284,1894,"Jan 20 2005	Very Impressed	I was pleasently surprised when we checked in to this hotel on January 14th, 2005. I had mixed expectations (after reading the reviews) but everything was top notch. I received an exceptional rate from Hotels (93.00) and figured I would probably end up with a horrible place for that price (in NYC). The first thing we noticed when we walked into our room, was how clean the place was. It was also very near the sights. We parked the car in the garage for the 3 days and walked or took the subway EVERYWHERE. This hotel is centrally located and the subway enterance is on the corner.This was an exceptional value and we will definitely stay here again."
285,1894,"Jan 17 2005	Great hotel!!!!!!!!	We got started off very badly once we arrived (Dec 28th - Jan 1st). It was about 7pm and we checked in. We were sent to the 8th floor and the room was occupied. We went back down to the front desk, was given another room on the 4th floor, it was also occupied! Now we're upset. We go back to the front desk and we were given another room on the 4th floor. 3rd time a charm! It was unoccupied. Other than the mixups when checking in, our room was very clean. We got a room with 2 double beds. We stayed there 4 nights. You must show your room key whenever returning to the hotel so that was peace of mind that there is some security. I would most definetly stay at this hotel again. It was in a FANTASTIC location and located near Penn Station which was very convenient for us. They didn't even charge us for the rollaway bed. You couldn't ask for a better location. We didn't have the best view - we were in the back BUT it was very quiet and we slept great! Very quiet hotel. The staff I would give mixed reviews. Some were helpful and some were not. I would recommend double and triple checking your reservation though! All in all, the hotel was great and no disappointments. I would stay there again."
286,1894,"Jan 12 2005	Location Location Location	We stayed at the Martinique just before Christmas 2004... and it was brilliant.... we were very sceptical after reading the mixed reviews on this sight, but I had to write one myself after being there. The hotel was in such a fabulous location. The staff were very friendly and helpful (thought the singing doorman was a nice touch) the hotel was well presented and clean. We felt safe the entire time we stayed there. The breakfast incuded was wonderful.... the only drawback on the hotel was the room size.... but hey your in New York City.... you don't need to sit in your room. It seemed a small sacrifice for such a brilliant location. Can't wait to go back. A *****"
287,1894,"Jan 5 2005	Good Value at the Martinique	We stayed at the Martinique over the 2005 New Year period. Good clean room, good security and pleasant, polite staff, especially the bell captains who were excellent at arranging transport etc. My only criticism is regarding the slow check-in where the front desk staff are very good but there are not enough of them to cope with peak periods."
288,1894,"Jan 3 2005	Overpriced	Due to the disorganisation of the husband, we ended up booking this the night before our stay on 29th December and paid $220 for the room. Upon arrival, was disappointed to find out check-in was at 4pm but check-out is at 11am. The room itself was very small but had all required facilities and was clean. Our window looked onto some scaffolding and I was a little surprised to see workmen on it whilst dressing the next day! Breakfast was poor but luckily I wasn't hungry. The gym was OK but I didn't get to use it as it was a little off putting to find that the people in the office could watch you working out. The best thing about the hotel is probably the location - it is just around the corner from the Empire State Building and we walked to Times Square. Wouldn't stay there again for that price - I am sure that there are far better hotels available."
289,1894,"Dec 21 2004	Recommended	Spent a few days in this hotel which in in a great location, just around the corner from Macy's. Had a fabulous stay. Room was beautifully clean and bathroom too. Was really well looked after. Continental breakfast was very impressive with lots of hot and cold choices,very good value and staff really were very helpful.Recommend you stay here. I would definately go bcak there."
290,1894,"Dec 17 2004	Great location	Stayed last weekend, everyone was helpful and kind. Felt secure, they checked room keys entering hotel each time. Room was basic and clean. Paper thin walls so you can hear your neighbours. Paid alot for the time of year. No view from our 15th floor room. Overall, average."
291,1894,"Dec 15 2004	Not too bad for the Price	My husband and I stayed here in May of 04, we got a pretty good deal on the hotel. The rooms are very small, but clean. Although some of the staff wasn't friendly, some were very helpful calling cabs for us and helping us with directions. The location is good. Just a short walk down to times square. If you are on a budget this hotel works well. If you are looking for an upscale hotel I don't recommed that you stay here."
292,1894,"Nov 26 2004	Fiasco at the Holiday Inn	We stayed at the Holiday Inn last month for 4 nights. The best thing about it was the location, right in the centre of things.Everything else about the hotel was a shambles. I am still trying to sort out problems with my credit card where I have been billed for someone elses stay. We came back after a day out to find that our room hadn't been cleaned. We were in a smoking room despite requesting a non smoking room and the whole floor stunk.The bar was expensive and a lot of the staff were very abrupt. I would not go back to this hotel."
293,1894,"Nov 15 2004	It was better than I thought it would be except for.....	Smokers alley as we called it, the smoking 8th floor which is where we got put, (even after me emailing them to advise I was pregnant and would be arriving late so could they take this into consideration when allocating rooms) As you came out of the lift, the smell of smoke was terrible. The room itself was fine, clean (Bed clothes did smell of smoke but they changed them at our request on day 2 of our trip) the beds were comfortable and the bathroom had everything you needed and it worked. The customer service was a little hit and miss on the front desk and as they are the 1st representation for the hotel, this really should be 1st class. The duty manager did let us keep our room on check out day for another 5hours at no extra cost though. The Breakfast buffet was excellent value and the restruarant staff very attentitive to your needs. The hotel is well situated and I would recommend it as long as you ask for a non smoking room when making your booking. We visited 11/11/04-14/11/04."
294,1894,"Nov 4 2004	No problems	An excellent location for exploring this part of Manhattan. Service was excellent - especially when we arrived and there was no record of our booking, they rang Expedia right away and sorted it all out without a fuss.The restaurant - especially the buffet breakfast - was great, and very reasonably priced."
295,1894,"Oct 18 2004	Avoid Avoid Avoid there are far better hotels for the $$$	I recently had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of arranging a business meeting and hotel rooms for 8 guests at the Holiday Inn 'Martinique'. I have never had a worse experience in my career. AVOID THIS HOTEL. It all started from the minute I called their reservation office. The person could hardly speak English and messed up every single one of the 8 reservations I made (each a single, non-smoking room) pretty straightforward or so I thought. She even listed multiple names on each reservation for added confusion. The &quot;sales&quot; department was not much better. It took them 3 days to respond to my request to book a conference room and send pricing. It also took 4 reviews of everyone's reservation to ensure they were correct, but when we arrived at the hotel they were all messed up again. My boss had to wait 45 minutes for a room. Not a good thing. For a hotel that has &quot;conference center&quot; in their title, they surely don't have any staff experienced in running a business much less a hotel. Really unbelievable, every step was painful made worse by the service, rudeness, and general uncaring attitude to &quot;make things right&quot;. Heck, I never even got a thank you or a receipt when I asked for one!"
296,1894,"Oct 13 2004	3 star prices for 2 star service	One would think that when staying at a Holiday Inn, no matter where it was located, there is a certain amount of quality but we didn't find that at this NYC hotel. Upon check in, we realized that the key to our room didn't work. And although this was immediately reported to the front desk, during the 3 days that we spent at the Martinique every time we left the room and returned, we had to wait for security to come let us into our room. This sometimes took up to 20 minutes!!! (I do have to give kudos to John in security -- he was a very nice friendly guy who seemed dumbfounded by the fact that our key continually refused to work -- may have had something to do with the battery in the lock losing power, at least that's the explanation everyone used to explain the problem but nobody ever bothered to recharge the battery). Then there was the fact that we were put in a smoking room when we specifically requested a non-smoking room. My inquiry into being moved to a non-smoking room seems to have been overlooked. And while the room was clean, it was somewhat shabby. However, the one thing the Martinique had going for it was location!! Perfect for tourists on a budget who wanted to stay somewhere central. Just don't expect the bare minimums of a 3 star hotel . . . this one is probably on the lower tier of 2 stars!!"
297,1894,"Oct 10 2004	We thought it was OK! In fact it was good!	We stayed from Sept 8th to Sept 11th 2004. We had been in New York for a few days earlier before having a weeks break in Lake George. The Skyline Hotel cost us more and we were pleased that the Hotel Martinique was better quality for less money. We couldn't fault the hotel apart from little things like providing a fridge and safe in the room and expecting you to pay extra to use them. The room was well appointed and the bathroom was of a high standard.The hotel is well situated and the staff were all very helpful and appreciative of a few dollars tip. I would have no qualms whatsoever about recommending the hotel to friends and stopping there if ever I back in NY.If you are visiting NY for a holiday I would recommend getting one of those tickets that allow you to see all the attractions for a reduced price, e.g the Empire State Building, SS Intrepid and the Manhatten Cruise."
298,1894,"Aug 30 2004	a little sketchy	We wanted to stay somewhere midtown, so we thought that the Holiday Inn would be an inexpensive, but decent choice. As it turned out, the room itself met just the minimum qualifications for a 3-star hotel. There wasn't anything terribly wrong - it was just very run down. With taxes, the room cost around $150/night - not a great deal..."
299,1894,"Aug 19 2004	Not Typical Holiday Inn quality	I travel to NY on business frequently and thought I'd try another Holiday Inn property closer to where I needed to go. Big mistake. First of all, this property is privately owned and not part of the Intercontinental properties. It shows. At check in (2am, after delayed flight!), I proceeded to the designated Priority Club check in. As I stood there waiting for one of the two employees to wait on me, another family came to the desk in the regular line and were taken care of first. I was given a smoking room (non-smoking was reserved), the room though large for NY city standards was extremely dated, bathroom floor dirty and beds were very sagged. I awoke the next morning to banging and pounding and found two rooms next to mine were being completely remodeled! All the furniture was moved to the corridor and someone was installing carpet. This was at 7:30am! That night upon returning to the hotel, I asked to change rooms. After returning to my room to gather my belongings, I found that my magazines left on the night table were gone. After reporting this to the front desk manager, he did little but say he'd have to call security and housekeeping. Upon checking out, no one knew the whereabouts of my magazines. Surprisingly after insisting I be reimbursed, they credited my bill for the magazines. I would not recommend staying at this property. There are much better in NY. This neighborhood may be 'convenient', but it isn't worth it."
300,1894,"Jul 27 2004	Great for a trip for 4	I came here in June 2003 with 3 of my girlfriends for a short shopping trip to NYC. This was one of the cheapest hotels we could find through expedia (160.00) that had room for 4 and was close to everything. The room was standard, clean, regular size. The lobby was really nice. We checked our luggage in at the front desk early in the morning and then did shopping and came back later to check in. Everythng went fine except for the check-in took FOREVER! To avoid paying for extra people we just had two people go in to check in and then one brought us out the room keys and then the other two went in (you have to show a security guard your room key before he lets you in to the elevator, which made me feel a little safer). Having never been to NY before it was a great location, there was a subway enterance right next to and across the street. You could see down the street was a less desirable area but we stayed on broadway and we were right near the empire state building, a Manhattan mall right across the street, H&amp;M, Macy's, Madison Square Garden. Central Park, Times Square, 9/11 Memorial were all within 1-2 subway stops away so it only took 5 min to get there. My only complaint is that my friends all complained that the matresses were super uncomfortable with springs in their backs, i slept fine, i must have gotten the good side of the bed :). I would come here again if i was staying for a short time with friends, but not if i had to pay 160.00 for myself. You cant beat $40/night/person in NY!"
301,1894,"Jul 23 2004	Great Hotel	After reading the negative reviews posted about this hotel, I was apprehensive about our stay. But, I had nothing to worry about. Everything about this hotel was great including the low rate we found online! We were permitted to check in early in order to make it to a family wedding. The room was large, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was huge! Everyone from the front desk staff, to the bellhops, doormen and maids were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was surprisingly quiet for being centrally located to everything...shopping, Empire State Building, subways. Our stay at the Martinique couldn't have been better!"
302,1894,"Jul 22 2004	Stop whining this place is great!	We stayed at this hotel on the 30th of July for one night just prior to sailing out of NY on the Queen Mary 2. The staff was just about as nice as can be and the room itself, while not posh, was incredibly clean, well maintained, comfortable and best of all, we felt safe. It's very convienient to Macy's, Penn Station, the ESB, and just about a 15 minute walk to Times Square. We drove into the city and I decided to drop the family off at the hotel before taking back our rental car. When we arrived, I asked the bell hop if he knew how to get to the National Rental Car location and he offered to go inside, call them, and then ride along with me to drop the car off and then walk back. I told him not to worry about it but, just his offering was the sign of great service. Later that night, I asked about a certain restaurant and he went inside and came back out with a discount coupon; hey, it saved me $20!Thru the years I've learned that, if you treat someone with respect and not as though they are beneath you, you'll get it in return. I can't imagine anyone having a problem with anyone who works at this hotel.I would recommend this place to just about anyone."
303,1894,"Jul 3 2004	Lock up your belongings	When we stayed there in May of this year we had items taken from our suitcase and when we reported it to security we were told there was nothing they could do as we could not prove that the items were taken while we stayed there. As we had just arrived in NY and told them that the items were in our suitcase upon check in. Also when we checked in, we were early and told that they would check us in but they would not hold on to our cases until our room was ready so we had to stay in the hotel bar until it was ready. Although central and is a great base while staying in NY the stanford next door seemed nicer. Would not recommend this hotel to anybody."
304,1894,"Jun 30 2004	Caution go elsewhere in Manhattan	Great location just one block from Empire State building. Check in fine and everything on first trip ok. Returned after one day in Canada and found it a totally different experience. The check in took 15. As we returned at 22.00 only smoking rooms were left. Payment was made in advance but they took no account of that saying rooms given on first come first served despite what you have asked for. Placed in the pent house! Actually it's just the top floor attic room. Can't stand up in bath come shower as I would have hit head. Staff rude and surly, but expect that everywhere in Manhattan. Not good for the money. Much better quality can be found for the price, shop around."
305,1894,"Jun 29 2004	The PERFECT visit and family vacation	Five night stay from 21 June to 26 June 2004. Family of three. 12th floor Rm. 1218 The title of this review says it all! The walk from Penn Station to the hotel with our bags was no problem. The lobby was clean and the staff was very courteous and professional. From font desk check in, to our room was about 5 minutes. The room was slightly smaller than most Holiday Inns but I expected it to be. We had plenty of room for our family. The entire room was extremely clean and very well maintained. Restraunt menu was limited but we enjoyed dinner and the breakfast buffet. Housekeeper on the 12th floor (Aurora) made our stay extra special with little touches, such as leaving our daughter's stuffed animal on the bed facing the door to greet us upon our return from touring. She always greeted us in the hallway every morning, with a smile and a hearty &quot;top of the morning to you&quot;. The location was perfect and we found everything we needed within a 5 minute walk, i.e. restrauants, subways, shopping. Bottom line: I will recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit NYC, and will stay there again, should we visit NYC in the future."
306,1894,"Jun 19 2004	Check in disaster	Would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you are desperate.Its in a very busy central area and not very pleasant. The public rooms are small, the bar doubles up as breakfast area. The barman can't make cocktails. Breakfast is poor with a very limited selection. Staff are friendly but not very interested. The rooms are clean but small.We arrived at 14:00hrs and were told there were no rooms available and told to come back at 16:00hrs. At 16:00hrs we were given two rooms, one was Ok and the other turned out to be occupied by another guest. They gave us a key card for his room!!! So much for security.Next we were given a room on 18th floor business suite which was totally unacceptable. It was dirty, smoky and dark. Then finally after applying pressure on the duty manager we were given a twin room for my two daughter's after almost 4 hours wait. Do you need this after a long flight?Would not stay there again, there is much better around. Stay at your peril and if you do, don't give in. Push for what you asked for. Geoff Crisp UK"
307,1894,"Jun 17 2004	Great Stay	I read the reviews fom others and decided to take a chance. The rooms were clean, the service friendly and the location was sensational. I did not try to use the internet connection as I used an internet cafe right down the street from the hotel. I especially was pleased with security as the doorman checked for your key as you entered the lobby. I would stay there again!"
308,1894,"Jun 8 2004	A Memorial Day Weekend to Remember	I also read the negative comments about the hotel and was ready for anything when I got there over the weekend...I was VERY surprised. Despite a mix-up w/ our room (HOTELS.COM at fault)...our stay was part of a very, very, nice vacation. The location couldn't have been better...it's close to everything! Not only were the staff members friendly and helpful....one of them even took me and my friends site-seeing around the city after he got off work...how much more helpful and friendly can you be?!!! So thanks to Anthony our new friend and tour-guide...I can't wait until my next NYC vacation....I know exactly where I will be staying! ;)"
309,1894,"Jun 4 2004	Great location!!!	Stayed here in May 2004, saw mixed reviews but have to say it was fantastic! Bit of a mix up at check in as we wanted a twin room but some free drinks sorted that one out! After hearing comments about the size of rooms in New York I couldn't believe the size of our room - it was huge! The staff were very friendly, breakfast buffet was very good and could not fault the location as it's so convienient for everywhere. All in all a great hotel, in a great location and would go there again!"
310,1894,"May 25 2004	Good Price Good Service	My Husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Martinique for 1 week in April 2004. Our stay was more than pleasant, Our room was cleaned each day with fresh linens daily. The coffee pot and coffee packets each day were a plus. Budget minded yes, but this hotel does not lack service. Wouuld recommend to anyone looking for a clean and affordable place to spend a vacation."
311,1894,"May 25 2004	Good value for the money!	This hotel was above average. There were mixed reviews on the boards and not that much information out there when we were booking it, so here goes:Great location, very clean. Two blocks from Macy's, 10 blocks from Times Square, two blocks from the Empire State. Cleanliness in a hotel is the most important thing for me, and I'm fairly picky/squeamish about some things. I can put up with bad service, but not a dirty hotel. So we were pleasantly surprised! The rate was about 115/night I believe. But I ended up getting a discount, paying 99/night 9see below) Excellent service, especially the bell desk. The bellman was loading our bags onto his cart minutes after we arrived, took it up to our room right away. Check in was easy, although we arrived late at night. Check out was even easier. Good security, you have to show your room key every time you come into the hotel. Good buffet breakfast in the lobby restaurant (not included), 11.99). Again, good service in the restaurant. The room was clean, good towels, decent furniture, tv, alarm clock, iron, big closet. I think the hotel must have been recently renovated, as everything looked new-ish. Small room, average bed, a double I think, no view. We stayed in Room 1815. It was very quiet, fairly secluded and tucked away at the back of the hotel, on the top floor. Our friends had a good room, good view, no closet. We noticed a lot of airline staff stayed there. That says a lot, I think. They even had their own check in desk! Problems were minor: 1) first morning, our room was not cleaned. We arrived back about 10 pm. I called the duty manager, who apologized profusely, sent up clean towels within minutes, and knocked our rate down to 99/night for the duration of our stay. No problems at all after that. 2) we ordered coffee from room service Friday morning *almost 7 bucks for three cups!! When we left on Monday, the tray was still sitting in the hallway, right where we left it. Again, a minor problem. Advice: go to Speedy's across the street for coffee. Great food too, we ate there three times and it was amazing. The coffee provided for the coffee maker in the room was horrid. Room service coffee was good. Overall, this was a good hotel, great value for what we paid. We will definitely stay there again."
312,1894,"May 18 2004	Wonderful Mother's Day weekend!!	My mother, sister and I just spent 3 nights at the Martinique on Broadway for 3 nights. We had some problems when we got there with our room not being ready but the front desk manager got us another room right away and gave us free coupons for drinks and appetizers in their bar. I found the staff to be friendly and the security very good. Whenever we needed anything (pillows, towels,washcloths) the staff was always very prompt in bringing it to the room. We really enjoyed the Irish Pub down the street &quot;Jack Dempsy's&quot;. We ate dinner there twice and I would go back again."
313,1894,May 11 2004	Friendly and helpful staff	We stayed at the Martinique for 3 days and can only compliment the attitude of the helpful and friendly staff. We initially had a problem with our room due to work on the heating system which was not fully completed. The duty manager immediately apologised and moved us to a superior room. Would most certainly stay again.
314,1894,"Mar 30 2004	Holiday Inn Martinque On Broadway - thumbs down im afraid.	Firstly, what a place. For both of us it was the first time to stop off in NYC for the weekend. It was wonderful, I think that we managed to taste just about everything in the short two days we were there... But we didnt sleep much... nor spend very long at all in the hotel room (read below). For those new to the city prepare to spend a wad of cash.... It seemed to fly from our wallets! The people were very friendly and helpful on the whole. Sightseeing was expensive, and there were queues for most attractions. Food on the whole was inexpensive, and the portions large.Turning now to the hotel, which, unfortunately was the downside to this trip. The Holiday Inn Martinique was awful, simply awful. Firstly, we arrived about an hour later than planned (5.30pm). There was a huge line at check-in (at least half an hour), despite being priority club members we weren't offered the promised priority treatment. The clerk checked us into a single room!!!! After we had paid for and reserved a double!!!! BEWARE. The room was marginally larger than the bed, had no closet space - certainly a lot smaller than the photographs on the website suggest. In the bathroom, which was small - but adequately sized, grout was colored black in places - evidence of mildew. Also the bathtub looked like it had been there, and well used for more years than it probably should have been, with clear discoloration. The bed, yes the bed. Well it was a 'double' as they described, double in the fact that two people could lie in it with a sheet of paper to separate them! (most people wouldnt call it a double to look at it tho!) The sheets however were clean and fresh. We did complain, primarily about it being a single room - however, reception took ages to answer, and REFUSED to acknowledge their mistake. A second call to the manager, they acknowledged the error, but tough - the hotel is full! They offered to move us on our second and final night.We didnt come to New York to complain and waste time dealing with sub-standard service, so we let the matter lie. And we did have a mind blowing, exciting weekend which we wouldnt miss for the world.We had one incident with the check-in/security, when our swipe card didnt work. They refused me access to the room as my name wasnt the same as my partner - despite me showing full photo id. This was exhasperating and very frustrating, and needed me becoming VERY ASSERTIVE before they would do anything about it.However, whilst we were checking the room before check-out, we had the misfortune to check under the bed... and saw [1] a packet of snacks had been emptied under there (some time before), [2] balls of hair and fluff.. So it would seem that the room service doesnt really clean the rooms thouroughly.The staff overall were not welcoming, and you feel very much part of a production line, rather than a guest of the hotel.On check out, we pointed out the bad aspects of the hotel to a very patronising manager who had the good grace to give us $50 of Holiday Inn vouchers. We've stayed in other Holiday Inn's where the service and standard has been exemplary. Unfortunately, Martinique on Broadway isnt one of these properties. So its a great big thumbs up to the Big Apple, but a disapointing thumbs down to the Holiday Inn."
315,1894,"Mar 15 2004	Highly Recommended	My college daughter and I stayed 8 nights at Holiday Inn Martinique on Broadway. We were very pleased with our accomodations, the service, security, cleanliness, location, and treatment we received. We would definintally recommend this hotel and stay there again if in NYC. Great location!"
316,1894,"Mar 12 2004	Bring your own TILEX	If you want service, do not stay at the Holiday Inn Martinique Hotel. The down fall of that hotel is the rude Managers that are currently working there. I remember when the hotel first open about 4 or 5 years ago the respect, the service and friendliness the managers gave the guest was very very satisfying. The front desk employees always had a smile and the room attendants were so attentive.WHAT HAPPEN! Know with the exeption of Carolyn, I think that's her name everyone at the front desk is grumpy. And the housekeepers look like their most loving relative past away. Well I understand about the housekeepers because i called housekeeping and asked to speak to the director,because the grout in my room was disgusting. I remember her name because i made sure i wrote it down. (GETA ) I explained the problem with the grout she said she will take care of it. I went to my meeting and when i returned the grout was extremely white I proceded to remove my clothing and got in to shower. When I finished taking my shower I noticed that the grout was the same way it was before I complained to Ms. Geta. Apparently the director of housekeeping at the holiday inn paints the grout instead of good old fashion tilex and a grout brush. When I called to speak to her Ms. Geta was very offensive and slammed the phone. This hotel I will never visit again. THANK YOU GETA!!"
317,1894,"Mar 6 2004	Better than expected...	Having read some bitter remarks about this hotel I found little to complain during my 8 nights stay in march 2004. I booked the room online on the Holiday Inn homepage, the reservation worked, the room was very clean with a view, the room service was excellent, the staff nearly almost friendly. The location of the hotel is excellent, you are within minutes at all locations in Manhatten. Two negative remarks: though the hotel has only a few lifts some are constantly out of order, that takes some time, do not use the phone exept for local calls, the price is absurd. Tip: book early online, the rates seem do differ from day to day."
318,1894,"Mar 5 2004	Good for tourists not business travel	Stayed for three nights at the Holiday in Marinique on Broadway in early March, 2003. The room was clean and spacious, well lighted, and well furnished. The housekeeping was excellent. I found that using the dialup internet access in the rooms was impossible; it took three or four attempts (each costing $1.00 for the local call) to get a 22,000 kbs connection that was not suitable for uploading data. One or two of the elevators was out of order the entire stay, so getting in and out of the building was not easy during &quot;rush hours&quot;. If I had not been under pressure to use e-mail and to get to and from the worksite quickly, it might have been better."
319,1894,"Feb 17 2004	Not a valued guest of Holiday Inn	I have the say this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in NY. I felt like I was not a guest of the hotel because I was told by the Holiday Inn staff that I booked the room through an online site and did not have the same priviledges as a hotel guest who books the room through Holiday Inn. I was told I have a room with a view and a Queen size bed only to find out I had no view and two twin beds and they said sorry you are not a Holiday Inn guest of the hotel. The manager then said how can I make your stay better, but sorry you are not a guest of Holiday Inn cause you booked it online. The rooms were a hole in the wall and the bathrooms were filthy, you had to disinfect from the dirt cause you could not call the front desk to assist you because you were not a guest of the hotel cause you booked the room online. I would not recommend this hotel chain to anyone, you are better off sleeping with the homeless on Broadway cause they have a cleaner piece of cardboard and nicer manners then the Holiday Inn."
320,1894,"Feb 14 2004	I recommend this hotel	My daughter and I stayed at the Martinique in July 2003 when we came to NY for her NYU orientation. Two little quibbles: one of the elevators was out of service and they only have 56k dialup in their business center.The room was decent - two double beds, not particularly large but it served the purpose. It was clean and quiet and we didn't feel cramped, so we were happy.They offer a pretty good breakfast buffet every morning in the little restaurant area. There's also a business center with fax machines and computers. I spent an hour online and it only cost me $5, which is cheap.GREAT LOCATION! 10 easy blocks to Times Square and the Theater District, 2 blocks to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, about 2 blocks to Macy's and a really neat mall, and maybe a block from the Empire State Building. I'd stay there again and would recommend it to friends."

1,1898,"Awesome	The hotel and staff where fantastic, and its location slap bang in the middle of times square absolute awesome"
2,1898,"Does the Job	Stayed for two nights this past weekend at the Renaisance Times Square. I have been to NYC a dozen times over the past 10 years, however had not stayed in a Times Square hotel before. It is certainly not for the faint of heart. I would not recommend the location to anyone except those who enjoy pushy, loud, touristy crowds with children. There are other parts of the city with locations just as convenient, where you don't have to deal with people who are inexperienced with city walking and sidewalk etiquette. That being said, the hotel itself is very nicely modernized and renovated into a boutique hotel. Lobby was a good size with updated furnishings. Our guestroom was on a high floor with nice views over the TKTS booth. I liked the king bed and settee seating. I loved the bathrooms, expecially the sink and shower. The only negative thing about our room was that it had quite a musty smell in it, almost like mildew. We ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning. Was completely overpriced!!! $60 total for two people for some eggs and bacon. We ate breakfast another morning a block away for half the cost. Staff was great! Oscar at check in was super nice! Other than him, we never interacted with anyone else, which is fine by us....I would recommend this for familes traveling with children, that don't mind crowds and mayhem."
3,1898,"Nov 16 2009 	Nice hotel - Did not like the location	The hotel is very good, however i fould that being IN times square (literally behind the coke advert) it was very busy, therefore 'popping' back to the hotel was a very exhausting experience! If you want to stay in Times Square this will be perfevct for you."
4,1898,"Nov 4 2009 	Excellent Hotel - Helpfull Staff - Great Location - BUT Expensive!!	We went to NY and stated in the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square from October the 28th until the 2nd November. It was a great hotel, nice room with two double beds on the 26th floor (club class), The room was clean, had a great view and met our expectations. The locations is superb as we could pop back to a kip and a tea at any point if we wanted, Erick the concierge was fantastic. see him if you want anything at all from restaurant booking to directions to free passes. We ordered a Piza and a few pepsi's and fries and it was $70. Bloody expensive, but again of a good standard. We spend 3,000 in 4 days but we done everything from Empire stare, Basketball, Chicago show, Helicopter flight, ground 0... the works!!"
5,1898,"Nov 3 2009 	Overall a great hotel!	The hotel is in a great location in Times Square. It's not smack in the center of Times Square like Marriott is, which is a good thing. Housekeeping was fast in bringing extra towels. The room was a good size with a nice bathroom. Very clean. Definitely would stay there again."
6,1898,"Nov 2 2009 	Excellent Hotel in the heart of the City	This hotel had large rooms, excellent facilities, with great friendly staff - &amp; couldn't be in a better position, right at the top of Times Square. The view from the restaurant is amazing - not to be missed."
7,1898,"Nov 1 2009 	Overall Good Hotel but Some Funny Smells	I was in Manhattan on business all of last week and stayed at the Renaissance Times Square. The facilities were good. Gym had some decent equipment. Room was nice but the carpet desparately needs cleaning. My white socks had brown bottoms after the first hour in the room. Also, the elevator from the ground to the lobby consistently smelled foul (like used diapers). The breakfast for gold/platinum members was good, and the staff ranged from fantastic (esp Michael) to marginal. Also, if you want a bathtub, you need to request a room with one. On the positive note, the views from my room (1617) were great."
8,1898,"Oct 30 2009 	amazing city great hotel	we came to new york for a once in a lifetime holiday and thats exactly what we got. from the moment we arrived the staff couldnt do enough for us, from arranging theatre tickets to providing a bottle warmer for the babies milk. the hotel is in a wonderful location in the heart of times sq although it does mean that it can get a bit noisey during rush hour. The bell boys were great to talk to and very often my partner would come back to our room after having a ciggeretteoutside with them with some tips for places too see. for example dont pay $50 for a grey line bus to the empire state, macys or statue of liberty when you can get the city bus for $10 and it takes the same route. The rooms are perfect for the type of stay we had and big enough for the two of us , the baby, the pram etc. Reception staff very friendly, bell boys are great but a guy called JJ really is the best guy we have ever met, very funny, very NYC."
9,1898,"Oct 27 2009 	In the Heart of it all	My husband and I celebrated my birthday in New York and we chose the Renaissance Times Square because it was in the heart of it all. The hotel is nice, the rooms are small, and the view was really nice. We didn't use the restaurant in the hotel because we thought it was too expensive and there were so many other options steps from the front door. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families because there's not any &quot;kid friendly&quot; stuff to do. The streets were REALLY crowded the line for the tkts booth was only about an hour long."
10,1898,"Oct 27 2009 	OUTSTANDING LOCATION UPGRADED TO SUITE! GORGEOUS! RESTAURANT HAS AWESOME VIEW OF TIMES SQUARE.	The hotel beautifully decorated, the staff friendly. Manny the front desk manager is a delight! We plan to return!! We walked very short distances to everything!!"
11,1898,"Oct 24 2009 	FABULOUS INTRODUCTION TO NEW YORK CITY.	From the monent we walked thru the door, the service at the Renaissance was terrific. Everyone and everything made our stay in NYC a wonderful experience. The rooms were spacious, the view great, and the concierge was great. They saved us time and money helping us plan our activities in the short time we had to see it all. And we really did seeit all. After a long day of sightseeing, it was so nice to have such comfortable beds and luxurious amenities waiting for us. Thanks again to the Marriott."
12,1898,"Oct 21 2009 	Great Splurge...	Overall no complaints here at all... The staff is nothing short of fantastic (sign up for the rewards points) Valet has a sense of humor and is very quick considering it's off site. The rooms are an average size, so if you are looking to lounge for any amount of time, get a suite or stay somwhere else... But, that's not ther reason to stay here. it's in the middle of times square. So get out an live a little. Only couple draw back that have more to do with experience than the hotel. First is the driving is a little odd with the new patterns... get a good map and follow that. Online maps haven't caught up fully. The second is the resturant... The view is great, literally at the end of times square. But the food if overpriced, even for times square. $32 for two eggs over easy with ham and toast not including coffee or juice... I'll pass next time. Also, traditional 'sub' lobby is a little annoying but for safety, I can't complain."
13,1898,Oct 14 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	Stayed at this lovely hotel in September 09. Staff were always friendly and helpful and only too happy to help you plan your outings with giving good advice for using subways etc. We stayed on a room only basis but did eat in the hotel one evening and had a fantastic meal in the restaurant which overlooks times square. Rooms were a good size with really comfy beds and large bathrooms with great showers/toiletries. Check out time is 12 noon but the hotel are only too happy to keep your luggage to leave you free to do what you want until its time to be picked up for your flight home and also do the same if you arrive before your room is ready. Would certainly recommend a visit to this hotel.
14,1898,Oct 9 2009 	Great location	Perfect location for a fun romantic weekend. Room was nice with a great shower. It would have been nice to have free internet.
15,1898,"Oct 9 2009 	Comfort great location and service.	This was our first time at the property and this hotel would definitely be on our list for future consideration when traveling to NYC. Although we had stayed for 1 night, the hotel made a great impression on us. The check-in staff was courteous and housekeeping staff was prompt to deliver additional toiletries when we requested. The room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel was clean and has class and fully meets the expectations of a 4-star hotel."
16,1898,"Oct 8 2009 	Fantastic location - right in the heart of Times Square	have just come back from a long weekend in NYC, staying at this hotel for 3 nights. It was excellent. The staff were friendly and made us feel right at home from the moment we checked in. We had a room on 10th floor, which had a great view overlooking the side of Times Square (Hershey's). The beds were sooooooooo comfy, and the room itself was great, more than we expected.We had a meal one evening in the hotel restaurant, and the view was amazing! it's like sitting in a big box with 3 out of the 4 walls being glass, so you get to see all of Times Square, with the glass ball drop being smack bang in front of you. Fantastic! The restaurant windows are actually part of the lghted advertising billboarding on the north of Times Square, how much more in the middle of Times Square can you get!Having previously stayed at Millenium Broadway hotel, and Marriott Marquis in Times Square, the Renaissance is definately the best. It's more of an intimate, understated hotel. A hidden gem, in the madness of Times Square. Definately the place to stay if you want that quiet oasis of luxury, right in the midde of Times Square"
17,1898,Oct 7 2009 	Great View!	Our room was on the 21st floor and the view was incredible! We overlooked the heart of times square!!
18,1898,"Oct 4 2009 	I love this place	I have been here so many times that the porters, reception etc all recognise me and my family. This is an amazing place, it is on the doorstep of Times Square which will suit you if you like a little hussle. The hotel has everything you could want including during New Years a reserved section so you can see the Ball drop and a restaurant on the inside with a direct view of Times Square.If you are a theatre goer, stay here. It has the TKTS booth just outside. Tour buses are round the corner as is the Port Authority.Hells kitchen is round the corner, eat there. Stay away from the themed restaurants of Times Square. Hells kitchen is a bargain for every kind of food you could imagine.The hotels rooms are so clean and fresh, the hotel has been going through a refurbishment programme for a number of years and is no completed. The staff there are great and they can handle the emergencies that turn up. My father had a big problem with his teeth, within 40 mins there was a doctor in the room!I have alot of respect for the staff in this hotel, they really take care of you. Don't look for upgrades though - there is enough business in this place and they are usually above 90% occupancy. Enjoy!"
19,1898,"Sep 25 2009 	New York City- Home of good service manners and civility. Huh?!	We went to New York City on Labour Day weekend to celebrate our 20th anniversary. We expected great dining experiences at every price level. We knew there would be fantastic shopping venues. We expected excellent theatre on Broadway. We knew that the city never slept. And we were braced for New York's fabled rudeness, aloof, if not downright surly service and &quot;I don't have time for you&quot; attitude. Man, were we shocked. We got the dining, the shopping, the theatre and the amazing pace and all exceded our already high expectations. What we got, in spades, that we did not expect was a great hotel at a decent price in a prime location. Excellent service at every turn (with a smile). Helpful advice and assistance from everyone we encountered including hotel staff, restaurant staff, shop keepers, passersby and police on the street. New York may have been the friendliest damn city to which I have ever been. What the heck is going on here? I almost feel cheated that I was not &quot;ruded in&quot;. I did not hear, &quot;Hey, I'm walkin' here!&quot; even once. Kudos to the Renaissance Times Sqaure for helping make our stay wonderful. Thanks also to the River Cafe in Brooklyn for the best Steak and best view I have had in a restaurant in a long time. Thank you New York and sorry for ever thinking you were rude.-An enlighteded and humbled Canadian."
20,1898,"Sep 16 2009 	reniassance rocks!	All the previous wonderful comments on this &quot;boutique&quot; hotel are right on spot. We loved everything about it- perect service, location for broadway, extremely comfortable beds, cool decor and very quiet inside! The staff rocked. They called us by name from the start every time they saw us and always rose above any need! Thanks to all, especially TJ and Emanuel!"
21,1898,"Sep 7 2009 	Surprised	Excellent, one of the best hotels I have stayed at in NYC.Check in, the clerk was friendly and quick, we received the room type requested.The room was, large, clean, comfortable, everything you would expect in a 4 star hotel.Location is of course fantastic, if you are visiting the greatest city in the world why not stay in the center of Times Square."
22,1898,Sep 2 2009 	Great hotel but POOR meeting services	Excellent hotel in a great location. The rooms/facilities were great. I held a meeting here and was surprised to see a HUGE bogus charge on my CC a month later. The hotel sent me a bogus receipt that I have never seen before. My sign in sheet has a figure that does not come close to the hotel's figure. I would advise not to provide any CC details to this hotel as they just process numbers without warrant and or warning.
23,1898,"Aug 20 2009 	Great Location Wonderful stay	We visited NYC with our two sons ages 7 &amp; 9, the Renaissance was a great location and an affordable solution to a spur of the moment trip. We were really happy with the hotel, that it wasn't too big and very modern feeling. The rooms are a little small, but perfectly fine. The linens were nice and comparable to other Renaissance hotels I've stayed in. The bellman and staff were very nice, we arrived at 8:30am thinking we would have to store our bags until later in the day when we would be able to check-in. Luckily they had a room available, and allowed us to check in early - which was very nice as we had been traveling for a few hours already! The only slight criticsm was the concierge always seemed extremely busy, I wish they could have had two at the desk to more quickly serve people, but this is a slight quibble, and by no means not a reason I wouldn't return to this hotel. I think for the price, this is a great hotel. We were close to everything, all the Broadway theaters, Rockefeller Center, Restaurant Row, a central Subway line. I would suggest this hotel to my friends."
24,1898,Aug 17 2009 	great place to stay	I never stayed in New York. I live on long island we went to see A play and stayed the night. had a great time.
25,1898,"Aug 10 2009 	Modern hotel in the heart of the action	We had the pleasure of staying at the Renaissance Times Square Hotel for three days during a recent vacation to New York City. Although at first we were a little hesitant to book this hotel (fearing large crowds outside the hotel entrance, difficulty to park our car, noise, etc) we were extremely pleased with our stay and would strongly recommend this hotel to others who wish to be right in the middle of the action. X literally marks the spot for this hotel for it is located right in the middle of Broadway and 7th Avenue (where the two streets cross in an X formation) right in the middle of Times Square. The decorator used the X location as a source of inspiration and carried the theme throughout the hotel by adorning it with X-like sculptures, chairs, railings and other accents. The hotel dcor is extremely modern/ futuristic yet classy which is definitely something you will not find in other hotels in NYC.The location and view of Times Square is second to none. Despite knowing New York like the back of my hand, I could not help but be amazed by the hotel views. The main restaurant offers a truly priceless view over Times Square giving you both a birds eye view as well as the feeling of being right in the middle of action without the hustle and bustle of the crowds outside. The food at the restaurant is also good. Their lunch and dinner blue selections are the specials of the day and offer excellent quality for a modest price, which I would highly recommend trying for either lunch or dinner when soaking up the view. Having stayed at various other hotels in the city, we were very impressed with both the size and amenities of our hotel room. The double bed hotel room we booked was very spacious and larger than the rooms at the Marriott Marquis and Residence Inn Times Square. Although we were four in a room, we did not feel as though we lacked space, even though we had lots of luggage. The room itself was tastefully appointed offering a work desk, reading chair and side table, two double beds, a large armoire, a flat screen television, a mini bar as well as a close up view of some of the neon signs adorning Times Square. The washroom was bright, clean and equipped with a speaker connected to the television so that you can hear the television while showering. The washroom also had complimentary Aveda soaps and creams which were great in order to relax at the end of the day.The hotel is also very efficient in unloading your car and parking your vehicle. You just have to pull up in front of the hotel and the porters will take care of everything. Parking is extremely expensive in New York City and the average going rate for a 24 hour period without in or out privileges is about $65 for an SUV in a public parking lot. The hotel offers valet parking for $51 for an SUV and parks the car for you making it a breeze to check in and less expensive than looking for your own parking.The concierge lounge is quite small so it is offered only to Gold and Platinum Marriot Reward Members. It is only open for breakfast and offers a limited selection of the usual breakfast staples: scrambled eggs, toast, yogurt, muffins, juice and coffee.The staff at the restaurant and concierge louge were extremley polite and efficient. The hotel was kept immaculately clean and we even saw hotel employees touching up paint during our stay in order to keep everything in tip top shape.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be right in the heart of the action or who is visiting New York City for the first time. It is a great hotel for couples, singles and families with teenage children who are looking for a modern hotel which sets itself apart from the other conventional hotel chains. The hotel is not a budget one so I would recommend booking it on discount sites or on Marriotts site when promotional rates are available. Enjoy!"
26,1898,"Aug 9 2009 	Superb all-rounder!!	First impressions were great as soon as we stepped out of the taxi. The hotel is right in the centre of Times Square lots of people around! however we had no trouble sleeping at night no noise was heard at all,probably because we stayed on the 25th floor-very high up! The room was a good size,large king bed clean linen everyday. Good choice of channels available free on the TV. There is an easy-to-use digital safe hidden away in one of the drawers. The bathroom was amazing large shower with glass door, magnifying mirror (for all those ladies who like to spend time on their make-up like me!) speakers in there to hear the TV. Shampoo,shower gel,towels replaced everyday. It looks just as it appears on the photo's you see on the website.Concierge &quot;Eric&quot; and &quot;Divina&quot; were very pleasant and helpful especially helping me with my missing suitcase they contacted the airport and airline for me.My boyfriend and I had a meal in &quot;Two Times&quot; restaurant within the hotel,located on 3rd floor excellent views of Times Square and most importantly the food was of a very good standard shrimp cocktail and crabcakes were delicious!!We would definately stay here again on our next visit to New York and would recommend it."
27,1898,"Jul 31 2009 	No room despite confirmed reservation	I was denied a room despite confirmed reservation (Confirmation Number: 85534207) for Check-in: Tuesday, July 21, 2009, the officiating lade was rude and offered an alternative accomodation in a Guest House of 22 rooms, looks like the have devised a clever way of making a fool of the customer, beware of this hotel you could be denied a room despite confirmed reservation and offered a US$ 100 room, and bullied to accept this. STRICTLY AVOID THIS HOTEL"
28,1898,"Jul 29 2009 	arrogant staff horrible experience never to book with Marriot in my life	I had a confirmed reservation for 21st July 2009, was shocked to know when went for checkin at 5:00 PM that the hotel was over booked, they never had the courtesy to inform earlier !!!, was made to wait for 20 minutes without any explanation and thereafter a very rude lady (reception) offered to accomade me in a gust house of 15 rooms. it is indeed a great business plan of Marriott to first overbook and then shift them to Guest houses costing US$ 100, upon my refusal they were rude and helpful. My request for refund was turned down down and was told that a fee of US$ 300 would be applicable as if it was my fault !!!. . Surprisingly they asked us to find other accomodation as they could not find any other accomodation. After great problems i was transferred to Hotel Hemsley, but the entire evening was ruined. I would receommed never to stay in this Hotel,"
29,1898,Jul 23 2009 	Great locaton	This is an excellent place to spend a few days in New York. The rooms are larger than most New York hotels and the staff seemed very friendly.It is located in the heart of theatre land and during the day walking to the major attractions is not a problem.
30,1898,Jul 23 2009 	Perfect Location	Had a weekend in NYC and chose the Renaissance because of its great value for such a good location. Right in the heart of Times Square.Staff at check-in and concierge were fantastic and couldnt do enough to help you. Cool funky bar and very spacious rooms (mine overlooked Times Sq) and very comfy beds.
31,1898,"Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful location	The location was awesome, the beds were soooooo comfortable, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we bought 7 day metro passes and got to see an awful lot from Harlem to sign the Michael Jackson tribute wall next to the Appolo theatre to Coney Island to sample Nathans hot dogs, Greenwich Village with its market is worth a visit on Saturdays and Canal Street Chinatown on a Sunday for handbags, watches and dvds, what an exciting city."
32,1898,"Jul 13 2009 	Awesome location and service!	This was the best located hotel I have been ! Right in Time Square, it was quiet and clean. I received a very good service and the food was delicious. It was pretty pricey though."
33,1898,"Jul 12 2009 	Amazing Times Square Location!	I have to say that I've always loathed staying in hotels BUT we arrived at The Renaissance, Times Square, on 4th July (holiday weekend) around 3.20 pm (a good half hour before the official check-in time) and received warm greetings from the doormen, lobby and reception staff. We were able to check in immediately and were really pleased that all our room requirements had been met (two interconnecting rooms, one with king bed, one with two double beds). The super fast elevator (of which there were several so no waiting around) took us to our rooms on the 8th floor, both with wonderful views over Times Square. Substantial tinted double glazing and heavy 'black out' drapes meant no neon invasion and little or no road noise - I think we heard two ambulance sirens during the whole of our 5 night stay but our sleep was not interrupted despite being countryside dwellers! Both rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. Bed linen and towels were changed daily and all complimentary drinks, soap, shampoo, etc., were replaced when necessary. Both rooms had fully adjustable air conditioning which was a welcome relief from the high temperature outside. The batteries to our room safe needed replacing during our stay and this was done within minutes of ringing down to reception, nothing was too much trouble. On the last day, after check-out, we were able to leave our luggage with the hotel's lobby service (free of charge) allowing us plenty of time for lunch and extra shopping before leaving for the airport, AND the doorman arranged for a cab to take us to JFK!We chose to stay at The Renaissance because of its SMOKE FREE policy, its location on Times Square, and its size (only 305 rooms so much smaller than most hotels in the immediate area) - we were not disappointed. We didn't get round to eating at the hotel because breakfast wasn't included in the tariff although it was available as an extra, as was lunch and dinner too (there are plenty of places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner on and just off Times Square). Rate per room per night: $259 first night, $239 remaining four nights PLUS taxes. Our stay was a dream from start to finish and worthy of the highest recommendation."
34,1898,"Jul 7 2009 	Great location!	The location was perfect - we were on the 19th floor, so ask for a higher up floor when you check-in. We were facing the Hershey's store and had great views. The staff were pretty good - we used their free internet daily - just sign out the keyboard from the concierge. Our only complaints were the flat pillows and the low-pressure showers (trust me, you'll need it after walking around all day!). We didn't eat at the hotel or bar so can't comment on that but would def go back at the rate we got ($130USD per night). We could hear the honking and sirens from our room but it wasn't too bad."
35,1898,"Jun 9 2009 	Fantastic central hotel	My partner, Jane and I went to New York in Feb this year and stayed at the fantastic Renaissance Hotel situated in Times Square. We had both been to New York before but had always stayed in hotels that were not so central to Times Square. This hotels location was absolutely brilliant. You walk out of the front door and BANG you are right there in the middle of the action, i cannot recommend it enough. The staff were very friendly, the hotel and rooms were clean and well maintained and despite its central location outside noise was at a minimum.My only tiny downside was the fact you entered the hotel into a very small lobby, got into a lift to take you to the first floor where you had to get out of the lift, cross another lobby to get a different lift to get to your rooms, however as i said this was more than made up for by the rest of the hotel.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, so if your looking for a centrally located reasonably priced New York hotel go for it."
36,1898,"Jun 8 2009 	Great for viewing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade!	I highly recommend staying at the Renaissance Hotel in Times Square if you're looking to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from the comfort of your hotel room, OR even to watch the ball drop on New Years Eve. I first discovered the idea of just getting a hotel room to watch these events when I came across this article about the parade route change and hotels you can watch it from: http://www.nytix.com/Hotels/articles/thanksgiving.htmlHopefully it will help someone else looking to enjoy the parade as well!"
37,1898,"May 29 2009 	Decent hotel in a great location	A clean, modern hotel with most of the amenities you would expect at this level. Its best feature is definitely its fantastic central location. However, the friendly, helpful staff mentioned in previous reviews must have had the weekend off; one of the receptionists was positively surly."
38,1898,May 24 2009 	New Yorkers Perspective	I am from NY and stayed here 2 nights with my friend just to get away for a quick weekend. For a Manhattan hotel to be located in the heart of Times Square this was perfect. I was ecpecting lots of noise at night with the all the cars and did not hear one beep. The room was clean and everything worked. The location to get around is perfect for tourists. I would highly recommend staying here because of its location and convience.
39,1898,"May 23 2009 	Pretty good choice for midtown	We stayed at the Renaissance for 6 nights. Overall it was a good experience--staff was friendly, room was clean, good view of 7th avenue. Location was great as a central hub for Manhattan (the 49th and 50th st. subway stations are very close by), and had the Times Square feel without having to wade through the tourist cattle.I had a few misconceptions about the hotel before my visit, so I thought I'd share them here for future visitors' benefit. Firstly, there is no guest room in the hotel that has a view of Times Square. The closest are the corner rooms that look down 7th ave toward Times Square. However, I should say that this is actually because the hotel shares a wall with the signs and ads that mark the ends of Times Square. For example, on the opposite side of our room's bathroom mirror was the huge Samsung ad. So, those tall narrow towers of ads you see in pictures of Times Square--one of those is actually the Renaissance Hotel.The second misconception was the actual size of the interior of the hotel. Having stayed at other Renaissance properties, I expected the lobby/lounge areas to be a little larger. What you actually have here is a tiny lobby for check-in, from which you take an elevator up to the rest of the lobby, which really is just a long hallway. From there you can take a different elevator up to your room. It's obviously a result of the real estate and the tiny triangular footprint they have to fit into, but if you're looking to wow friends or clients in the lobby/lounge, you may want to look at the Marquis (which has a much more impressive atrium and rotating lounge).The only thing that really bugged me was the restaurant, or more accurately, the hotel staff's constant recommendation of it. We asked a few different employees during our stay for their recommendation of a good place to eat nearby. Without fail, from the concierge to the doorman to the bell staff to the housekeeper--they spit out the name of the hotel restaurant. This became especially funny when I asked (at around 2am) for the name of a good place to grab a snack--they still first recommended Two Times Square (their restaurant), before stopping and realizing that the restaurant had closed hours ago. If I rejected their recommendation, they offered a halfhearted alternative. I know they're probably instructed to do so, and they're just peddling the company line, but come on if the concierge can't even give me a &quot;real&quot; answer then why are they there.We actually did eat there once during our stay, so I'll provide my thoughts. Well, the restaurant is the only part of the hotel that offers a direct, unobstructed view of Times Square. The view is amazing. The restaurant also serves rather uninspired fare for ridiculous prices. If you must experience the view, pass on dinner and come down early for breakfast. Its cheaper and generally less crowded (on weekdays). We were turned away by the prices for dinner, deciding to return the next morning for breakfast and were strongly urged to make reservations for breakfast. We passed, and came down early the next morning to a near-empty restaurant. Breakfast was pricey too, $30+ a person, but the so-so food and high prices are much easier to swallow when you have the restaurant to yourself and are seated at the best table in the house. Overall a good hotel for a midtown base. I'd place it squarely between the Doubletree and the Marriott Marquis as far as hotel impressiveness factor."
40,1898,"May 17 2009 	Terrific Location and Good Value	Qualifying for the &quot;Senior Rate&quot; of $203 per night, the Renaissance Times Square was an unbeatable value. Of course, this rate is not going to be available when there is a big convention in town and this hotel is full, even though it is not a convention hotel. May is a great time to visit the Big Apple - not yet too hot and not too cold. Like all Marriott Hotels, this is 100% nonsmoking. The rooms and entire hotel were redone in 2007 and our room had carpet, wallpaper, furniture, and the bathroom in perfect condition. We were on only the eighth floor and could hear only a low level of noise outside. The airconditioning system is very effective and the bed was very comfortable. We did not have one of the rooms with a shower separate from the tub, but the tub-shower had plenty of hot water and sufficient water pressure. Of course the refrigerator is one of those that registers a charge when an item is moved, so it is not useful for storing your own food. Despite the complaints of others about thin towels, we found them nice.For those who remember the very deluxe breakfast buffet of years past (expensive but worth it )- it is gone. Now breakfast is only ala carte and so very expensive - eggs, toast, juice, and coffee are $30 per person, that we ran over to the McDonalds directly across the street (two doors down from the Doubltree Guest Suites) for an affordable breakfast. We did not try the restaurant for other meals.Pluses: Can be an outstanding value; 15 minute or less walk from every Broadway theatre; airconditioning that works; comfortable beds; clean and pleasant rooms; and a small enough hotel that staff and elevators are not usually overwhelmed. Walking distance to MOMA, Fifth Avenue, the Design Museum and Columbus Circle.Times Square is full of places to eat and to get food &amp; drink to bring back.Minuses: No buffet breakfast; rooms that are typical for New York - not tiny but not very large; lack of drawers (one drawer in the dresser - TV cabinet) is taken up by a safe; a strange set-up for a business center - the concierge has to provide a computer keyboard and the concierge tends to disappear from his desk frequently and when there to be busy with guests and no free printing at the business center. The check-in desk has been moved to the entrance area from the lobby one flight up - not an improvement - now the manager on-duty cannot keep an eye on the concierge and the restaurant and lounge. The designer who decided to take the mirrors out of the elevator and replace them with dark wood made them somewhat invisible - there is no light to signal that an elevator is coming and it is hard to see if one has arrived since the inside is dark and the doors are dark."
41,1898,"May 16 2009 	Great Hotel!	This hotel is fantastic! I was sorry we only had this room for just one night. The room was probably the biggest room I've ever had in a Manhattan hotel. The location is perfect if you want to be in the middle of the NYC action, as the hotel is right at the north tip of Times Square. If you're a theatre fan, the TKTS booth is literally right across the street. You're within walking distance of Central Park and several subway options. If you're looking for great restaurants, go 1 block west and 2 blocks down to Restaurant Row on 46 St between 8 and 9 Avenues. Our favourite there is Le Rivage. The best pizza you will find is Patzeria on 46 Street just west of Broadway. It's a tiny hole in the wall, and is more of a takeout place, but it has a loyal following among the theatre crowd.If there was anything to criticize, it's the fact that you can still hear some street noise from our 14th floor room. But considering that you're in Times Square, it's not surprising."
42,1898,"May 6 2009 	Super price fantastic location great room	Booked this hotel for GBP 70 per night (!!!) and asked the chap on reception for high room, getting the 22nd floor.Room is very funky, with huge walk-in shower (but no bath). Very large bed, big TV, great window with fantastic views.Strangely the reception is on the ground floor, but the lobby is on the first floor, and you have 2 use 2 lifts to get to your room. If you want a GORGEOUS view on Times Square, just pop in to the restaurant next to the lobby, and sip a cocktail looking down on the famous X of the roads. We didn't have any food there, but the door man was a good help. If you come out the front door and turn left, walk for one block, there is a great cafe with super-fresh bagels etc. on the left.Walking to nearby attractions is so easy, and half the joy. Times Square is a little rowdy late at night, but it is always safe because of the sheer number of cops."
43,1898,May 4 2009 	Great location attentive staff	Booked an double room on a high floor. Nice room and very comfortable bedding. Soundproofing is fantastic. You dont hear any noise at all. Bathroom fine. Lighting a little cold. Attentive staff and perfect location
44,1898,"Apr 23 2009 	Better than the Marriott Marquis	Having stayed last year at the Marriott Marquis (very mixed experience), this is the better option if you prefer a smaller boutique style hotel experience than the large anonymous Marquis. Bedrooms are in a very contempary style and the bathrooms a little on the small size, but have great showers even though I am a bath person. The corner rooms (they end with 17) are larger kingsize rooms but they back onto the elevators. You do get a view of the Hudson through the buildings and Broadway. I would comment that there seems to be insufficient chambermaids and those they have seem over worked, as I found dust in my room on arrival on the TV stand. Came back from sightseeing all day to fnd room hadn't been cleaned at 3pm. Otherwise pleasant 4 night stay.There is no executive lounge at his hotel, but you get a voucher for a snack from the main lounge menu. The breakfast is in an area requiring key access and staffed by a lovely bunch of guys who were always on hand to help with a cheerful smile. The concierge staff were very professional and helpful. One word of caution if travelling on an evening flight back to the UK, the latest checkout is 2pm here even if you hold a Rewards Platinum card.The great thing about the hotel is the location. Both the Metro bus and subway stops within a few steps of the hotel entrance on the same block, so getting around town is very easy. Okay the Time Square crowds can be a bit manic especially if you go out there as one of the shows finish but then thats the charm of New York.My thanks to the lady I met in Washington for her tip to try Serendipity. Great menu, good food amazing desserts, even though it can be a long wait."
45,1898,"Apr 22 2009 	In the middle of everything!	We wanted to stay where the action was and we did. When we got off the subway the first day we had a little trouble finding the Renaissance so my advise for you if you choose to stay here, ask for directions to the M&amp;M store the hotel is right by it. I would stay at the Renaissance again. The room was clean, very comfortable and a decent size (not huge but for the price it was great). We spent very little time in the room but my family of four was comfortable and cozy."
46,1898,"Apr 18 2009 	Fabulous location helpful concierge very expensive breakfast	We stayed at this hotel with our three teenage daughters during our five-day sightseeing trip of New York. The location was fabulous with Times Square right on the doorstep along with the theatres, Rockefeller Center nearby and lots of shopping very close.It is not a big hotel and does what it says on the tin, although the breakfast was astonishingly expensive. We ended up going around the corner to Evergreens (47th Street) for brunch every day.The concierge at this hotel was in constant demand from the guests but was very helpful every time we needed help - from booking restaurants and trips to planning trips on the subway.Views from the rooms were also good - either of 7th Avenue or Broadway.Overall we enjoyed the hotel, but thought it was expensive although in a great location"
47,1898,"Apr 13 2009 	Perfect Location!	This was my first time traveling to NYC and I picked the perfect hotel. First of all the location is perfect, you are right in the center of Times Square, I could not have picked a better location. You can walk everywhere from here, we walked to Rockefeller, Grand Central Station, Central Park, Hell's Kitchen, 5th Avenue. The actual hotel is beautiful, I heard it just got remodeled and you can tell, the lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are incredible. You would think being in the center of Times Square it might get noisy, but it doesn't , I shut the blinds and didn't hear a thing all night. The staff is very accomodating and the conceirge will help to make sure you see everything you want, they were wonderful. The only thing I would advise against is ordering anything at the bar in the lobby, it is way overpriced, granted it is NYC, but you can find cheaper drinks around the town. I paid $6 for an espresso and had to tip, it was ridiculous considering you can go to Starbucks and get one for $2. Other than that I highly recommend staying here and I will definitely come back to the Renaissance next time I am in NYC."
48,1898,Apr 13 2009 	An exemplary hotel with a touch of real class	This hotel was amazing and made for an outstanding stay with my family. The hotel is immaculate and newly refurbished. The staff pride themselves upon customer service and do everything to make your stay extraordinary. The rooms are spacious and exceptionally quiet - pretty awesome given that you are on time square.The restaurant has breathtaking views of time square as do most of the rooms. Whilst you can afford top eat more cheaply make it a priority to have at least one meal here for the experience.I feel priveleged to have been lucky enough to stay at this hotel and will be back.
49,1898,"Apr 11 2009 	Awesome hotel!	I have been to NYC a number of times. This was by far the best hotel experience I have ever had in NYC. The Renaissance was so chic and polished. The staff were extremely professional, and I can't say enough about the room. The room was so beautiful and comfortable, so that I found myself not wanting to leave it. I was also amazed at how quiet the hotel was and how well insulated the walls and windows were from the noise of Times Square. My partner and I went for a cheaper room at the Crowne Plaza around the corner because work wan't going to pay for the room at the Renaissance for the Satuday night. We regret leaving the Renaissance and would have gladly paid the extra $40 to further enjoy the ambiance and quieteness of the Renaissance. This was overall an excellent hotel experience!"
50,1898,"Apr 11 2009 	Quiet haven	Stayed here for 3 nights. For a hotel right in the middle of Times Square it is extremely peaceful and quiet. Opening the room door, you are met with space! A huge bed - the most comfortable I have ever slept on. In fact, I wanted to put it in my case and take it home with me! Great plasma screen TV can be watched while lounging on the chaise -lounge.The massive shower has everything you need - loads of towels and toiletries which are re-stocked daily.Rooms are large and clean.Downstairs lobby area even has a booth to print out your boarding cards - very useful.Upstairs lobby has free internet available.Consierge is very helpful and knowledgeable. Doormen are friendly and fun.Best bits were watching folk scurriyng around Times Square below, you got fantastic views from your windows - ours looked down on to Hershey's Chocolate shop and the open air bus tours. Will definately return here again. we loved it!"
51,1898,"Mar 29 2009 	Great Hotel!	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Contemporary. In heart of Times Square. Can be a little noisy, but you are in Times Square, it sounds like NY! Very nice. Definitely recommend."
52,1898,"Mar 28 2009 	Perfect Hotel	You will not be sorry you stayed here. I spent a weekend with girlfriends and was extremely happy. Hotel is very, very nice and extremely clean. It's a little strange how it is set up, you enter into a very small first floor lobby where you check in. The girl at the check in desk was not extremely friendly, but by no means was she rude. Not very chatty and never offered a hello or welcome on any type, but not rude. The bellhops were more then friendly, greated us at our car and offered to take our bags. Everytime we entered the lobby whether it was in the a.m or p.m., the bellhops always greated us with a good morning/good afternoon. After you are finished with the small first floor lobby, there are 2 elevators that take you to the upstairs lobby. The conceige, 2 restaurants and a bar and waiting area are in this area. This is where there are 3 very fast elevators will take you to your room. Our room was very spacious for NYC and very clean. The beds were wonderful. The bathroom was also very nice. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone going to NYC. Great location."
53,1898,"Mar 27 2009 	Perfect Location	Stayed at this hotel from 28th Nov - 3rd Dec with my husband and what a delight. The location is so perfect and in walking distance to practically everything. The only subway we caught was to visit the statute of liberty. The staff were friendly, helpful and always cheerful - exactly how you expect the Americans to be, the rooms and hotel were extremely clean, the beds were exceptionally comfortable especially after not sleeping for 36 hours due to travel and last but not least the view from the restaurant is absolutely awesome. When we arrived at the hotel we were put into a twin room as no doubles were available but after a quick chat they arranged for us to move the following morning so whilst we were out sightseeing everything was arranged for us and when we returned we were shown to our new room with our suitcases already thereThe only downfall was the price of the drinks at the bar - 10,  not $, for 1 x glass of white wine I thought was quite excessive so we decided not to have too many drinks here during our stay. There are much cheaper drinks either across the road in the sports bar / Irish bar etc or even cheaper still are the 750ml corona bottles from the local shops @ $4 each.We loved New York so much we will definitely go back and will definitely stay in this hotel.Enjoy!"
54,1898,"Mar 2 2009 	Amazing stuff	I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.I went to 2 nut cases, that didn't like the hotel because we had to sleep in 2 queen size beds.So they gave me the harder time because of this.I talked to the stuff for this matter and everyone was so kind and understanding about my situation, they took care of me by making sure I was having a good time.Other than that the rooms are big and clean with great views of times square.It's very stylish as well plus the location .The subway is just around the corner ,cabs easy to get!"
55,1898,"Feb 10 2009 	Birthday trip	I choose this hotel partly on the recommendation of other Trip Advisor reviews and what I expected was what I got. I picked up a yellow taxi from JFK to the hotel ($45 flat rate 2 plus $5 toll), however two yellow taxi drivers had not heard of it so maybe it could be good to print off a map marking it's location for the taxi driver to see. There are some lifts that take you up from street level to the ground floor where the reception desk is located There are no alternative steps which is slightly annoying. The baggage room is also located opposite the lifts on the street level. The concierges were friendly and humorous and the check-in and out went smoothly. You can check out through your TV in your room if you wish. The clientel appeared to be mostly smart New York business people rather than tourists, but this mix could possibly change when it gets to the high season. There are two internet PCs in the reception area that are free to use. You just ask reception desk for the wireless keyboard and mouse. The room was of high quality as my photos show. I confirm the niggle that another reviewer found of single-ply toilet tissue! There is a free PIN operated safe in the room located in a drawer, useful for passports, tickets, money etcInternet access is charged per day for use in the room. Maid service was every day and a complimentary copy of the New York Times was left outside your room weekdays. The breakfast room has a fantastic view of Times Square, however to eat there is quite expensive. I had a couple of minor issues with the room that I reported to reception and within minutes somebody was knocking at my room ready to fix it. Very good service. The hotel is in the heart of the city at great location to explore all the sight the city has to offer. There is a subway station (49th St) close to the front door plus a bus stop right outside the door. You also often find a yellow taxi parked outside as well. Seventh Avenue is a one way street in the direction of Times Square. Not detracting from the hotel's quality, in hindsight I might have downgraded to a 3 * hotel as I didn't really need the quality as much. In summary a quality professionally run 4* hotel in a great location."
56,1898,Jan 22 2009 	Great Stay Great Positioning	We arrived and it really was what we expected. After arriving at JFK we were driven straight to the heart of newyork. The stay was perfect. We asked the concierge for info on NYC. They were helpful and gave us 50% off broadway tickets. It's the perfect way to get out of the cold.
57,1898,"Jan 13 2009 	Reviews are very accurate-	Stayed her to attend AMA Course at the AMA Center located on Broadway. Perfect location for just about anything in Times Square. Rooms are nicely appointed, with a large walk in shower instead of the traditional tub/shower. A good use of space. Internet is $16.95 per day, but includes unlimited phone calls. The phone calls aren't of value to most people with cell phones. Room overlooked the M&amp;M store. Like any hotel in Times Square, the lights can shine between the curtains at night. No noise from outside. Service has been outstanding. For example, blow dryer and remote died on the first day-within minutes, replacements were provided. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise. Excellent, attentive service and the food was great. The views of Times Square are priceless. Even if you don't eat here, stop in for drink and enjoy the views. My only recommendations for improvement are: 1. higher quality toilet paper(1-ply is not acceptable for this grade of a hotel), 2. higher quality towels( very thin and not soft), 3. clean better in the corners of the room between furniture and 4. offer free internet access (even the courtyard marriott offers this benefit). Overall, I would recommend this hotel. The best price was via the Marriott website."
58,1898,"Jan 13 2009 	Very impressed.	Brilliant location, very helpfull and friendly staff and very good value for money all round.I stayed at the Jumeirah Essex the last time I was in New York but wanted something a little more central this time. We booked the Renaissance Time Square as it sits in the middle of Time Square. We found the price to be very reasonable. The room was quite large, had a king size bed and was clean and comfortable. The staff were also very helpfull."
59,1898,"Jan 12 2009 	Fantastic New York - Absolute Buzz	Our family of four spent 4 fantastic nights at the Renaissance Hotel in early December, 2008.After a martathon 25 hour trip from Australia, we were relieved to finally arrive in New York and found that the Renaissance Hotel more than met our expectations from reading reviews on Trip Advisor.The room was excellent - modern, clean and well appointed.For first timers in New York - the location was perfect - no more than 20-30 metres from the lights, buzz and spectacle of Times Square - right in the middle of the action and a good central base for the other highlights of Manhattan.The service at the hotel was notable for it's friendliness, helpfulness and efficiency. Special mention to housekeeping who were tremendous - we really appreciated the welcome basket of fruit, cheese water on not one night but two.The doorman was welcoming and friendly as we were always treated to a sincere smile and welcome when coming and going.A neat trick that hotel has at their entrance is the warm downlights that encouraged two of NYPDs finest to stand by the entrance for warmth away from the winter chill - a good way to assure guests of that extra bit of security - not that it was needed because the location is pretty safe anyway."
60,1898,"Jan 5 2009 	Very convenient	Very, very convenient to all of the theaters, so it was a perfect location for seeing three shows in 4 days. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are spacious in comparison to most NYC rooms. Even though you are in the center of Times Square activities, it was not too noisy to sleep."
61,1898,"Dec 16 2008 	Perfect!	We chose this hotel based on location and price and it was perfect! It is right in the middle of the theater district and pretty central to everything else as well. A huge advantage for us was being able to locate the M &amp; M sign and know that the hotel was right there! Foot traffic in front of the lobby was minimal. Check in was smooth-all of our requests were met and exceeded! The rooms are nicely furnished, the beds are amazing and the bathrooms nicely laid out. Maid service was excellent the entire stay. All of the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. The restaurant was quite good and well worth the $$ just to be able to enjoy the view. If you want to stay in Times Square-this is the perfect hotel - neither too busy or big- but still in the center of it all!"
62,1898,"Dec 16 2008 	amazing staff....	I just wanted to say THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU once again on behalf of myself and my 2 girlfriends. We stayed at the Renaissance in November for a girls weekend of shopping, shows, and martini's and not only was the hotel in a perfect location with fantastic rooms and a great restaurant (we ate there multiple times!) but the hotel staff 'rescued' us at the end of the trip.After arriving at the airport 90min prior to our international flight, we realized all three of us had left our passports in the hotel room safe!! We immediately called the hotel and their amazing concierge jumped into a cab with the passports and RUSHED them to the airport just in time to catch our flight. Now here's the really amazing part.... not only did they not charge us a cent (for the $75 cab ride each way) but the lady at the front desk called us several times to make sure we were ok, calm us down, and then to make sure that we got home safely (and on time!!).Now that's what I call service.And they say New Yorkers aren't friendly? I beg to disagree :)Thank you Renaissance."
63,1898,"Dec 14 2008 	liked the Renaissance	Have stayed in NY 6 times before, first time in this hotel, hotel very nice and clean, rooms good size more draw space would have been useful as there were 3 of us sharing the room.great location and great for subways, not a place to stay if you dislike crowds as this is the heart of town, noticed this year it was busier than in the past.staff were always pleasent and helpful.to say how close to to the crowds and traffic we were we could not hear the noise in our room which was on the 15th floor.would stay here again if it was just my husband and myself in the room."
64,1898,"Dec 10 2008 	Action Central	If you want to be in the centre of Times Square action then this is the hotel for you. If you don't like the hustle and bustle of being at the &quot;cross roads of the universe&quot; then you may wish to reconsider visiting Times Square.The biggest selling point of the Renaissance is its location. Sure the subway is convenient and cabs are plentiful but nothing beats staying right where the action is. In my seven day stay in New York City the hotel became a sanctuary and oasis amidst a sea of chaos and frantic madness. I loved being able to step out of the hotel and straight into the action of Times Square. To walk a block or two to watch a major Broadway show. To walk to Macy's for the Black Friday sales in the morning, come back for a rest before walking up to Central Park in the afternoon. It is this convenience of being within reach of so many of the attractions that justifies the $$ you need to part with.The rooms themselves were pretty much what you would expect for a hotel of this calibre. Clean, comfy, modern, great beds, nice bright bathroom and free wifi in the lobby was an added bonus. Security was good - always felt safe and the service of all staff I came in contact with met my expectations. My gripes included a bar fridge that was jam packed with hotel products that didn't allow for guests own personal items such as fresh milk. Walls and windows I did not find as sound proof as other reviewers. On the 15th floor I heard plenty of traffic noise and the sound of other guests entering and leaving their rooms were also quite audible. But hey, who comes to NYC to rest? Overall a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location."
65,1898,"Dec 9 2008 	Clean central but not really worth the price	My partner had wanted to stay right in the middle of Times Square just once, so for a birthday surprise, I booked this hotel. Location-wise it really is in the middle of Times Square. One of the exterior walls of the hotel is actually one of the main walls of flashing billboards that make up the Times Square experience. Its a much better location as a pedestrian than it is for cars, as there is so much traffic. It was seemingly difficult for cabs to pull up to the hotel due to traffic and so many one-way streets.As for the interior of the hotel, it was very clean with many modern sculptural details that looked very anatomical, which was interesting, and the room itself was very big and also very clean. The king size bed was very comfortable too. But I did have a few issues with the hotel. The window in the bedroom opened for ventilation, but then it would not close. The screws in the hinges were clearly missing. We went out for the night, told the concierge in person that we had a broken window, and it was fixed (closed) by the time we got back to the room, but we were afraid to open it again. The view outside the window was good, but unfortunately the window itself was really filthy, so it pretty much ruined the view. Also, whenever I called down for the front desk or concierge, I never once got an answer from someone. It always went to voicemail. I would leave a message and no one ever called me back. I had to go downstairs everytime and find someone in person to get anything done. Basically very little in the way of service, which is annoying given what they charge. Finally, housekeeping did not seem to come until very late. We left to go shopping in the morning, came back mid-afternoon to drop off things and change, and were surprised to find the room was still messy and untouched. We had breakfast on the final morning in their restaurant which has amazing views of Times Square. They also have a very delicious S'mores French Toast, which was so sweet my teeth were still rattling on the plane ride home.Overall, the hotel is very clean and very central if you want Times Square, although it is so crowded I think next time we will stay in lower Manhattan for sure. The size of the room was very good, however for the price we paid and the service we got, I don't really think it was worth it. I've stayed at many other hotels in New York with good locations for much less and had a better experience."
66,1898,"Dec 3 2008	Great Hotel for 1st timer to NY	Where to start .This was the 1st time to NY for my wife &amp; I .The Hotel is New York ,being right in the middle of it .On arrival we went to the check in desk on the 1st floor I mentioned to them it was a special occasion &amp; we were upgraded to a room on the 21st floor &amp; were sent the biggest chocolate covered strawberrys I have seen .The bed ,,,where do i start,,, i remember my head hitting the pillow &amp; waking up some 8 hrs later .We had room service (the Burger was great ) &amp; i thought was reasonably priced All the staff made you feel welcome &amp; went the extra mile all the time just to help &amp; NOTHING was ever to much trouble.The free use of computers &amp; wi fi in the lobby was great also.Would I recomend it YESWill I stay again YESWell done to this Hotel ive stayed at some very expensve Hotels in Paris &amp; London the this stay tops them all"
67,1898,"Dec 3 2008 	In the Heart of Times Square	The hotel is in a great location if you plan to spend a lot of time in the Times Square area. It is also very close to several subway stops. There is one subway stop about 15 feet outside the door. I was dissapointed in a few things. The biggest was the fact my family of 4 had to live out of our suitcase. The drawer ( I have included a picture) was way too small. When you opened the drawer there were 4 small drawers. One of them was the safe so you only had 3 small drawers. The closet was a good size and there was an iron and ironing board provided. A hair dryer was also provided. The bathroom was nice. Not sure why but the bathroom also had a phone and a speaker to listen to the TV while you were in the bathroom. Housekeepers did a great job everyday. When we arrived at the hotel there seemed to be help on the ground level but they did not offer to help us with our luggage. With me and my son we did not need it but I am sure the ladies would have appreciated the offer, my wife and daughter entered first. Those same folks were nice enough to flag us down a taxi one evening and then on the day we checked out. Check in was easy and pleasant. My other complaint was the internet. For the amount we paid to stay here one would think the internet was complimentary. It was free on the lobby level where you could get a wireless connection but if you wanted a secured wired connection you had to pay for it.  There were 2 chairs in the room. the first was for the desk, comfortable. The second was not comfortable at all. Speaking of comfortable, the beds were VERY comfortable.One odd thing. On our last night one of the housekeepers (not really sure) knocked on our door gave us about 2 seconds and then entered our room. She wanted to know if we wanted the bag of ice in her hand or some chocolate. If we had been undressing or doing something else it would have been very awkward. We were there for 4 nights and that was the only time we saw her.If my wife and I were looking for a place to stay I would not have a problem staying here but I would look elsewhere with a family of 4. I am comparing the hotel to the Marriott Marquis about a block away. We stayed there 2 years ago and it was not available the week of Thanksgiving. Overall this was a nice hotel."
68,1898,"Nov 17 2008 	Great Location - Intimate Feel	This hotel has an excellent location and fabulous rooms.I traveled here for 4 nights in September with my family and my In-laws and I was very pleased at how intimate this hotel lobby was as compared to the Marriott Marquis. Just loved the style and the views from the restaurant. My In-laws had a regular room and we booked a suite on the same level. We wanted our children in a separate area to give us more room and we really liked the room. We also liked the fact that the suite has 2 bathrooms. This is a must with a family of 4! The decor was just beautiful and the beds were so comfortable. Breakfast every morning was expensive but you don't want to miss out on what is probably the best view of Times Square! There is also a long bench along the windows to take in the views. The food was delicious as well.There was just too much to do in the Times Square area. The concierge was helpful in telling us about intimate restaurants in the theatre district that were fabulous. Well worth the walk there.....even my 5 year old didn't have a problem!Maid service was very good, however I'm surprised that the suites at least did not have turndown service. Our children's bed was never re-made into a couch during the day.....they kept it as a bed the entire time taking up room and making it a bit uncomfortable to have my in-laws sit in the room. The suites did have 2 TVs making it nice for the children to watch their own programs.If I go back to NYC I will definitely stay here."
69,1898,Nov 16 2008 	right in times square	We stayed in this hotel for a romantic getaway. 3 nights right in times square. The rooms were not bad considering the price. Bed was very comfy and outside noise was barely audible. Inside noise however we could hear everything in the next room. Even though our neighbors were not loud simple conversation could be heard. Workout area was good.The bad: no in hotel store. Only 2 computers to use situated right next to the bar.Not a bad hotel but we believe not worth the price
70,1898,"Nov 14 2008 	I could live in that room forever...	It was our first time in NYC and we wanted to be in the middle of it all, so of the hotels on Times Square we chose this one almost entirely based on tripadvisor reviews, and were extremely satisfied. It has recently been renovated to a very high standard and was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is lovely and shower is glorious. I became particularly well acquainted with the bedroom when I had to spend a whole day in it with a horrible bug, so can also confirm the bed continues to be comfortable after 20 odd hours and channel choice on the TV is fantastic! By the way, don't be thinking you don't pay for all this. You pay, and you pay good. So be prepared.I read a couple of the reviews complaining a bit about the service, and to be honest though I agree the attitude of reception staff wasn't great (and the check in is WAY late at 3pm), it wasn't something to make or break the holiday. The lifts are very annoying though - one (which I believe is posessed and tries to hurt you on purpose) from street to reception then across the hall to another lift for bedrooms. Also, as you enter from the street you're faced with three huge mafioso types in long black coats. Sometimes they take your bags. Times Square is awesome, of course, but it is absolutely crazy busy and having friends who live in NYC we didn't spend that much time around tourist central. There's no need to be quite that in the middle of it all, as though it is a huge city it is real easy to get around. When we return we'll most likely stay at the Union Square side.On everything else: cabs are cheap, food is good, everything is huge. Love it."
71,1898,"Oct 29 2008 	Great hotel	I was staying at the Roosevelt Hotel New York and wanted to extend my stay but they were fully booked on the dates I wanted so I had to look around for something else. I had a look at the Marriott Hotel Times Square, but didn't like it. Just across the road, the Renaissance Hotel seemed much more intimate and friendlier.I booked a king size room throuigh Expedia, but when we arrived the only room with a king size bed was very small (we were told) and so they gave us a huge room with 2 double beds. Each double bed was 4 feet wide and so you can imagine the size of the room, and there was plenty of spare floor space.We were on the 17th floor, I think there were 26 floors altogether. The lifts were fantastic, travelling the 17 floors in about 15 seconds so you rarely had to wait more than a few seconds for a lift.The decor of lifts and lobby was a bit strange looking, but the carpets in the corridors were very colourful. The view from our bedroom was great, if you didn't suffer from heights, looking straight down to the road. The air-conditioning was fine, you couldn't adjust it or turn it off, but it was quite quiet. There wasn't much traffic noise either until the morning - I think there was some construction work nearby. The best thing about the bathroom was that part of the mirror was heated so there was always a clear area even if the rest of it was steamed up.Downstairs in the lobby there were a couple of pc's available for free internet access. The lobby is on the 1st floor so you have to go up to it from streetlevel and then change lifts to go higher up to the rooms.Leaving suitcases with the porter was no problem. Buses, taxis, and subways were literally just outside the hotel.A bit expensive for me, but a great hotel and one I would recommend."
72,1898,"Oct 29 2008 	Great Location and Furnishings but . . .	I stayed here in August and although the hotel inside was beautiful and the location for site seeing was excellent, I don't think I would stay here again.I think the first impressions put me off, we arrived at reception about an hour before check in time and we politely asked if we could get in our room early and we were met by a stand offish response form the receptionist who said no rooms were available. Fair enough, we were early but it was the tone of her voice. She suggested we go out and come back later but as we had been on an early flight we just wanted to get showered and changed so we said we would sit in the lounge area and get a drink instead. It then took 2 hours for a room to become available. We had booked a Club Level Superior Room which included wifi so we asked how we access the internet and she said it would be charged to the room, We had to argue and get out our confirmation email before who would accept that it was free of charge, then she said it would be billed and when we came to check out we would have to remind them to remove any charges! This is standard with this rate so why was this such and issue? Throughout the stay the reception staff always reacted like it was an inconvenience when asking them any questions. The safe was locked on entering the room and it took them 2 hours to send someone up to sort it out.But aside from being made unwelcome the actual hotel is furnished to a high standard with the most amazing comfortable beds and modern furnishings. The continental breakfast in the Cub Lounge was not great but there was enough to start you on your day and the lady who was serving us in there was particularly lovely to us.The location is fantastic for sight seeing. We managed 4 days in New York with only getting the subway once as we were able to walk everywhere. It is also very convenient for the Broadway shows (we saw the little mermaid and it was fantastic).When looking for a hotel in NY we did a lot of research and we picked this hotel for location and also because we had never been before we were worried about safety in NYC so wanted to stay on a main busy road. Having been there now and seeing how safe it actually is I would happily go for one of the hotels located in the lesser known site streets where you get more value for money, but you cannot take away the convenience of this location."
73,1898,"Oct 28 2008 	The most comfortable bed in the World!!	For first timers in New York, location was everything, and as another reviewer said, this hotel IS Times Square.Our taxi driver from JFK knew it so there was no confusion - and it was easy to find when we were out wandering around, right next to the M&amp;Ms shop.Decor was clean and modern, I believe it has been recently refurbished. All staff were courteous at all times, we were so pleasantly surprised. The bed...I'm not kidding. It was amazing! I thought our bed at home was the best in the world, but was nothing compared to the luxury of the enormous bed in our room. Pillows, sheets, everything. We loved it. Room also had coffee perk, luxurious bathroom with huge shower - really, we were delighted, and I usually find something not to like.Only reason I wouldn't stay there again is that next time we'll be staying in the village - but if it was a Times Square base again, no question, it was really good."
74,1898,"Oct 8 2008 	Best hotel if you want to be in Time Square	The hotel is located in the middle of Time Square. We got a discount on our room, so paying normal price would be expensive but the location would still be worth it. We got a room with two twin beds as requested. The room was very nice and the staff was friendly. The only negative thing about the hotel was the slow checkin."
75,1898,"Sep 21 2008	No rooms available	I booked my reservaction through Priceline. I specifically said I wanted two double beds and the customer service representative clearly said they had it available. Unfortunaletly, the hotel was sold out and could only offer me one king bed. Priceline gave me FALSE information. The hotel is taking no responsiblity for it even thought they work in conjunction with all travel websites. I DOUBLE and TRIPLE checked my reservation before I gave them my credit card. Go figure, it still was wrong. Be careful with booking through third party websites. You are not guarenteed what you are looking for."
76,1898,"Sep 19 2008 	Best Location and Super Safe	My wife and I stayed here with our two teens. I spent a lot of time researching hotels in NYC. As a former New Yorker who now lives in CA, I wanted to make sure that my return to NY was perfect. This hotel's location is the best. It's right in the middle of everything, and if something isn't close by, you can easily hop in a cab or walk. We had a room with two doubles, and the room was absolutely perfect. Many NYC hotel rooms are small, and I've stayed in them in the past. This hotel's room was big, clean, and comfortable. They have hotel security and it's hard for anyone who's not staying in the hotel to gain entry. Check in is not in the lobby. It's up a few floors. I've heard that the pricing in this hotel has gone up, but I must tell you that if you want to guarantee that you're going to stay in a clean hotel that's not the size of your closet, pic the Renaissance."
77,1898,"Sep 1 2008 	This hotel litterally IS Times Square!	Who would've thought that an address like 2 Times Square was pretty much Times Square itself!? This hotel is smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle that is Times Square. Great location for tourists, steps from multiple subway stops, and easy access to everything in and around Times Square, the Empire State Bldg, and the Theater district.I stayed at this hotel for a combination of leisure and business. For leisure, you can't beat this, as described above. For business, I would stay elsewhere in the future. While in the middle of Times Square, there was just too much everyday commotion around the hotel for it to be quiet and a getaway after work. You constantly have tourists around you at all times, which is okay when you're a tourist yourself...different story when you're trying to go about your everyday routine.That being said, the hotel accomdation is wonderful, as Marriot properties always are. Beautiful room with an excellent room overlooking 7th Ave. Checked out the hotel restaurant for breakfast one morning which has a fantastic view looking out over Times Square (but expect to pay a premium for the view and service). Unfortunately the hotel did not have a pool, but does give you access to another hotel really close by which has the facility (I did not utilize this). It also has a nice gym facility.Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Luggage holding service was great, because I could check out in the morning, leave my bags, go to work, and come back after dinner to grab them and head to the airport. Very convenient overall."
78,1898,"Sep 1 2008	A relaxing stay in the heart of Times Square!	I stayed at the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square from June 20-24, 2008 and had a wonderful stay. This wasn't my first time in NYC; however, it was the first time I stayed at this hotel. I can honestly say that the location is perfect! If you want to be close to all major attractions and Broadway theaters, then this is the hotel for you. The newly renovated rooms are gorgeous and very large, and the hotel itself is pretty quiet considering the busy atmosphere outside. I only had one minor problem during my stay. The first room I was given at check-in had a connecting door. I've never had problems with connecting doors in any other hotels I've stayed in. However, this door did not provide a very good sound barrier as I could hear the people next door as if they were actually in my room. An hour or so after check-in, I went to the front desk and was given another room without a connecting door. The front desk staff was very accommodating. The second room did not have a connecting door and was very, very quiet. Perhaps, if I wasn't paying $500 a night for the room I wouldn't have minded the room with the connecting door, but for $500 it better be close to perfect. The room had contemporary furnishings, a big flat screen TV, and was very clean. There was never a long wait for elevators, and the elevators in the lobby to the ground floor were very helpful. The views of Times Square from the hotel were great as well. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel and will definitely stay here again!"
79,1898,"Sep 1 2008 	Wonderful hotel	Having had such a wonderful stay the first time we decided to return again to the Renaissance for our annual christmas shopping trip to NY. With a radical facelift the rooms were freshened and modernised however some of the lobby decor was a little too modern for my taste. Having said that it was still a wonderful place to stay and the staff there are second to none. Bar staff were so attentive and on one night where they had to close slightly early they gave everyone a complimentary cocktail.The rooms were fantastically appointed with the most spectacular views of Times Square. Huge rooms with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Look out for TJ at the front desk or generally around the hotel what a lovely guy, you can't miss him at 6ft 11! Overall I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and no doubt will return again soon."
80,1898,"Aug 31 2008 	Loved the Renaissance	We stayed at the Renaissance August 26-August 30, 2008. 3 girlfriends in their 50's , first time in New York City. We loved the Renaissance. Before coming we emailed the hotel for advice on the best type of room for 3, bed types, etc and immediately received great advice from Jennifer at reservations. We settled on a room with two double beds , very roomy , fantastic linens, comfortable beds. Very friendly and accomodating staff, modern decor, rooms were comfortable, roomy and tastefully decorated. As stated in previous reviews, the entrance from the street leads to a small bell desk and lobby and an elevator to the main reception area and check in. We were surprised at how small the reception desk was, but this did not present a problem at all. Very intimate atmosphere and the staff were attentive to all our needs, granted us late check out when requested. Hotel is close to everything; Broadway shows, subway on the corner , within walking distance of all attractions, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Centre, St Patricks, etc. Highly recommend the Renaissance Times Square and would definately stay again."
81,1898,"Aug 29 2008 	excellent rooms nice atmosphere	my sister and I stayed at the renaissance 5 nights in August. We loved the room. at first when I booked they said 2 double beds were not available but then a few days before my reservation, I got an e-mail stating I could send the concierge a request for added amenities and so I requested the 2 double beds again and a high floor. when I checked in, I was grateful that they were able to get me 2 double beds. we had a nice view, and I loved that the window opened. the room was clean and modern and was set up well for the space. we requested and were given extra hangers. the location was terrific. the staff was very friendly and very accommodating. I never got a hint of attitude. the bar in the lobby is a little lacking, and I would have preferred a more active bar scene. we didn't eat in the restaurant there, but they gave me a cup of coffee when I was waiting in the lobby for my sister. the computers in the lobby are accessible and w/ a comfy private setting, although sometimes you do have to wait for them (there are 2 of them). all in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a nice, friendly sanctuary once you are done exploring the city! (by the way there is a great store/deli across the street where you can pick up supplies or snacks). we loved it so much, we are thinking of taking a trip to NYC every summer!"
82,1898,"Aug 24 2008 	Best Hotel in NY	I love this hotel, I first stayed here in March 2007, and it is just the best location in NY, right in the middle of Time Square, but quiet and up market. I loved this hotel so much in 2007 (choose it after reading many trip advisor reviews), when visiting NY again in 2008, with my mum, we agreed that although this place is expensive, it's worth it.The hotel rooms are lovely and I believe quite large for NY, the hotel was renovated last year, it looked fine pre renovation, the colours were nicer and the lifts were modern, now the lifts look a bit dated. It's so close to Rockefeller centre (visit top of the rock at night, it's fab and much quieter than the Empire State) and a short walk to the shops on fifth avenue.The concierge are really helpful, they helped us organise our essential shopping trip to Woodbury Common Outlets, an absolute must for shop'a'holics looking for a bargain, it's about 1 hour outside NY by bus."
83,1898,"Aug 22 2008 	Fantastic Upscale Property in the heart of the square	Stayed here on a whim on our way through town. Booked using Marriott points, so for a freebie it was amazingFantastic, stylish property, loved the copper wall coverings and unique lobby furnishings.The staff was extremely helpful, the car valet was courteous and helpful. Front Desk helpful as well.You must check out the view from the restaurant - it is probably the best view of time square. Kids loved the view. We tried the food, just apps, they were as good as would be expected.In terms of room choice, no need to stay on the highest floors, the lower levels have the best view of the street action and signs.This hotel is much nicer than the westin nearby, the westin rooms are tiny and the bathrooms looked like prison cell latrines. Go with this property, it is fantastic."
84,1898,"Aug 19 2008	I Cannot Wait to Go Back	I have not stayed at the Renaissance since 2002. Before that, I used to stay about twice a year for 5 years.I have not had the opportunity to get back to New York and my favorite hotel due to my last job.I truly cannot say enough about the staff that made each of my stays make me feel like I was a movie star. They really gave me the Royal treatment each and every time I was there. Amos, the doorman is a gem. He would listen to me go on and on about every detail of my days and evenings in my favorite city.Charlie, who managed Foley's, made my 50th Birthday, a night that I still remember. He had wine and the works sent up to my room knowing that I would be seeing Chicago. What a wonderful thing to walk into. Each time I went back, they asked if I would like my same table and gave me complimentary wine. You find it hard in this day and age that people actaully remember you, but they did and it has stayed with me.The next time that I am lucky enough to get back to Manhattan, I would not stay anywhere else."
85,1898,"Aug 13 2008 	Great hotel!	We stayed there for two nights in July (21-23) 2008. The location was amazing and the room was very spacious! We had a king room on the 24th floor. We had no issue with street noise even though our room overlooked the street on Times Square. Our room was very clean, had ample storage, a comfortable bed, and a large bathroom (especially for New York!). The shower was exceptionally large! We requested early check-in, which was honored and we were in our room by noon! The only negative is that the decor was odd, but it did not bother us. Just not our taste. The staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel!"
86,1898,"Aug 7 2008 	Location location location!	We LOVE the Renaissance. We have been staying at this hotel for the past 3 years. Every time we visit NYC, this is the hotel we stay at. The rooms are nice and large. You can't beat the location!"
87,1898,"Aug 5 2008 	Perfect NYC Hotel	Perfectly located in the theatre district and Times Sq., this hotel exceeded all expectations of our two rooms for a three night stay. The rooms were large, modern, clean, had every convenience imaginable and perfectly suited to both pleasure and business. The rate was fair and actually a value for the type of hotel this is, I'd compare it favorably to any high end NYC hotel, but with far less cost. Renovated and remodeled two years ago, this is a best kept NYC secret. As experienced travelers, we'd definitly stay there again and highly recommend it."
88,1898,"Aug 5 2008 	Loved the Renaissance 100%	The Renaissance Hotel in Time Square was an absolute find. Pro's:1) Staff was very friendly and helpful with arranging dinners reservations, cab rides etc (with a smile on their face every time).2) Location - It doesn't get better than this if youre looking to stay in Time Square. Right outside the hotel entrance you have the Subway, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Pizza, Hot dogs, M&amp;M Store, Olive Garden and much more. 3) Rooms were immaculate, very well appointed and plenty of space.4) Beds and pillows were super comfortable6) I was shocked how quite the rooms were considering how busy the street noise was.Cons:None!"
89,1898,"Jul 29 2008 	Great Hotel Even For A Picky Travler	My husband and I stayed here in jan of 2007 for my 30th birthday. When we booked this hotel, we used tripadvisor to decide which one was best. At the time, it was in the top 10 hotels listed. I would totally agree with this sentiment.While it has been a year and a half since our visit, it is my findings that hotels don't change that drastically in such a short period of time. We had excellent service from the staff and enjoyed the location. The price was also great for a NYC hotel!One of the best aspects of this hotel was the room. It was a good sized room for NYC and VERY clean. This is a MAJOR issue for me. After a long day walking and shopping the streets of New York, our room was an oasis.While I cannot say exactly what it is like today - I have to say that we REALLY enjoyed our stay."
90,1898,"Jul 24 2008 	Oasis amid Times Square	Great location and wonderful staff! Whether on the 2nd floor (in 2006) or the 13th floor, we could not hear any street noise! Nor any noises from outside our room. This trip included my 17-yr-old niece (loved the modern decor), my mother (preferred the prior 'old world' decor) and myself. I appreciate the cleanliness, the large rooms and bathrooms, the fabulous beds and the friendly staff (especially Tammy G). At check-in, the clerk noticed we had a higher rate for the last night (since it was a weekday) and she offered to ask her supervisor to match our weekend rate - she was successful and saved us over $100. This hotel is smaller than others on the Square and thus allowed us to become familiar with the staff and other guests. The street-level seating area was a perfect place for Mother to 'people-watch' with the bellmen when she preferred a rest and we wanted to keep going. The location allowed us to split up, do different things nearby and meet together easily - this made our trip perfect for all ages! I've read that some dislike taking an elevator to the 2nd floor lobby (the bellman can take your luggage on the 1st floor) . We didn't mind this at all as it seemed to take us away from the street noise and gave the feeling of stepping into 'an oasis'!"
91,1898,"Jul 18 2008 	GREAT experience	We stayed at the Renaissance from June 29th-July 1st 2008. We were VERY impressed with the hotel and would stay there again in a heart beat. Luckily, we got a great internet rate because the standard room rate is kind of steep.The hotel staff was wonderful. The rooms were beautiful, clean, and spacious with a great view. The hotel itself was very impressive and I was thrilled that we had selected this particular hotel.For those that complained about the check in being on the second level...who cares? The elevators were really fast and we NEVER had to wait for more than a few seconds. This hotel was wonderful and I would highly recommend it!"
92,1898,"Jul 15 2008 	Wonderful Hotel!	This was the hotel I stayed at for my first ever trip to NYC in 1995. I had always remembered it being very nice, but since it is on the expensive side, I never returned there for another stay until this past March. I was able to get a great deal for 3 nights through Marriott Rewards, so I didn't hesitate to book it. The hotel was wonderful in 1995, it has just recently finished renovating, and is now even more spectacular! The location is perfect! It is right in the middle, literally, of Times Square. Your within walking distance to Broadway, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center (I highly recommended doing Top Of The Rock!) etc... and then there's a subway station right there by the hotel that will get you anywhere else very quickly. The rooms are amazing! I had a king room and it was spacious! The bed was heavenly, there was a nice flat screen TV, big work desk with high speed internet ($17/day), comfy chaise lounge where you can sit and look out at the street below. There's a beautiful, marble walk in shower, complete with a bath seat! It was all just so comfortable! They e-mail you before you arrive if you book via the Marriott website, the &quot;virtual concierge&quot; and offer you some extras (of course for a fee) for your stay if your interested. I chose to have a selection of sodas brought up, they gave me 2 Pepsi's and 2 Sierra Mist's, and it was brought up, on ice, within 10 mins of my arrival into the room. The hotel employees I encountered were all very friendly and accomodating. I checked in early and my room wasn't ready, so I stored my bags and went out to get some breakfast. I came back, and my room was ready, so it was nice to be able to get in early. There are two sets of elevators you take to get to your room. The first goes from the street to the lobby, street level is where the bellhops are, then lobby to your room. I didn't find the elevators inconvenient, as they were always very quick. I can't comment on the restaurant, bar, room service etc... because I didn't use any of them. There's lots of wonderful restaurants in the area though. Ray's Pizza just down the street has fantastic pizza! I don't know if there's a full business center, but if you don't have a laptop, and need to use the internet, there's a computer in the lobby with free internet--which is a rarity at hotels! The Renassaince is a wonderful hotel, and I will definitely stay there again!"
93,1898,"Jul 15 2008 	Great property let down but dreadful management and service culture	We stayed at this hotel for five nights from 7 July to 12 July. We came for a combination of business and vacation.The Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square should be THE place to be - it's location is fantastic, the new renovations are sensational, the furniture and fittings are gorgeous, the room sizes are acceptable - but they are not in any way matched by an appalling management and service culture. And it's a crying shame.We had great service from several individual staff - one of the ground floor attendants was great, had great information and was very helpful. The staff in the concierge lounge were terrific. But the completely under-staffed concierge desk, who seem to have very little training and are not empowered to make decisions and to solve problems point to a serious problem with the way this potentially brilliant hotel is managed overall.On our second night, our toilet blocked, (and in addition, housekeeping had not replenished toilet paper supplies and despite a request to the concierge desk, after three hours none had arrived). The blockage was initially bearable (with trips to the lobby from our level 14 room whenever nature called), but after several calls and three visits to the concierge desk and their apparent &quot;emergency call&quot; to maintenance, the toilet started overflowing after the shower was used, onto the floor of the bathroom. Even then, maintenance had not arrived and the concierge seemed unable to take the decision to move us to another room! Finally, he did agree to move us (after some 2 hours - this was at about 10.00pm?), so we hastily packed, roused our sleeping child and shifted to floor 21 - to find the entire floor was still under renovation, the main hall was covered in sawdust and building offcuts and there were dirty dishes outside 'our' room. Several doors were proppped open to rooms clearly full of building materials and equipment, and trades were evidently going to be working on rooms adjacent to ours during the days of our stay. I called the concierge again and this time spoke (politely) to duty manager &quot;Greg' who before hearing out my concern and my request for a serviceable room, and perhaps anticipating a claim for compensation, offered an earful of attitude about the discounted rate we had booked at which he &quot;offered to honour&quot; because of the difficulty we had been through (which no time previously had been queried, and had been verbally confirmed by the Marriott Customer Care staff when I verbally confirmed the booking from Australia some time earlier).We had to wait at least a further 30 mins before key cards could be provided to another room, while I sat in the elevator lobby of level 21 with all of our hastily-packed luggage and a sleeping child on the floor amongst the sawdust, and my husband waited for the attention of the concierge in the lobby. (Initially they told us to wait and they would bring the keys when they had time!!! No way - my husband went to collect them so if we had waited I can only imagine how long we would have been left there).The new room was a king with rollaway - and like a previous commentor, the rollway was delivered with a grubby quilt with no cover, and the fitted (and very worn) bottom sheet of the kind bed was way too small, and did not fit the bed, it was under so much strain it kept rolling off the edges of the mattress and kept flicking off during the night, so we were pretty much sleeping on the mattress cover. Why spend sooooo much money undertaking such beautiful renovations and purchasing great fittings, then not get new bedlinen to fit the new beds?By now, we were beyond wasting any further effort seeking help, so we just let it be, knowing that none of our issues had received a prompt or helpful response, and we just wanted to enjoy our remaining time in New York. Which we did.On the upside, after the second move we were given a pass to the concierge lounge, probably as a sort of compensation, but that wasn't explained to us, we had to ask a day or so before departure what the different card meant, so we didn't get to use it much. The waiting staff there were very nice and helpful and made us feel very welcome - the first time we had felt welcome in the hotel at all.My suggestion - there are plenty of other places on Times Square in this same price bracket, that seemed from what we saw and from speaking with other travellers that are perhaps more plainly decorated but that are much more welcoming.Those hotels should recruit the concierge staff and the ground floor attendant from the Rennaisance, and leave the rest to sink.And Marriott should really consider what they can do about the training and culture of the management team at this hotel. It should be a jewel in the Marriott portfolio, and it's when things go wrong that it's clear the team running the place is far from up to it."
94,1898,"Jul 14 2008 	Loved the location...	Me and my family stayed here 07/06 - 07/09 and we had a great time. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is right in the middle of everything. The hotel itself wasn't too impressive to me. The decor in the lobby area is terrible. The rooms were okay but nothing to brag on. They were clean but small. The beds were small, as well. We had a high floor, which gave us a great view of 7th avenue. The staff was exceptional, which made up for all of the other shortcomings. It was my husband and I anniversary and when we arrived at the room upon check-in, there was a card signed by staff, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in the room for us, compliments of the manager. Which was even better, the manager had arranged a anniversary wish to be displayed on the Hershey's display, which was directly outside of the hotel. Again, the staff was exceptional. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel. We didn't spend much time there anyway because we were out touring the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for very nice and friendly staff and a super location!"
95,1898,"Jul 10 2008 	it's awesome and in the middle of it all!	We are three generations of gals visiting NY (two for the first time) and we all agreed that we really enjoyed our stay in this fabulous hotel. We wanted to see all that we could in 4 days.The staff was polite.We arrived on a Friday -before the posted check out time so the bellstand held our bags for us. The bellstand was conveniently located on the first level of the hotel with security team who monitors who is coming in the hotel; while the check in is on the second floor.The elevators were super fast and I liked the added security in the middle of the busy pace that IS Times Square. We stayed Friday-Sunday in a room on the 24th floor right next to the elevator but the room was extremely quiet.We adored the view and the beds were heavenly! The shower was awesome and roomy with nice soaps and shower gels.We did not eat at the hotel but had a wonderful lemon drop martini from a super nice bartender. The bar snack mix was good for a pre show snack. Speaking of... this hotel is close to so many things: TKTS booth, restaurant row, the double decker tour buses and the subway. We walked to dinner and shows nightly,saving on cab or bus fare. This is a first class hotel with good service: they even sent emails detailing the reservation and has a virtual concierge that emails you to get any special requests. The concierge gave us advice on getting same day tickets to shows (using the free internet in the lobby), showing us the theatre layouts. I found this hotel a refuge in the frenetic pace that is NYC."
96,1898,"Jul 7 2008 	excellent location	we stayed here between 30/06 to 6/07. we had a great time. the location was perfect, right in the heart of all the buzz and lights of times square, so if that is what you want then this is the place for you! staff were polite and friendly and answered and dealt with any queries we had straightwaway. 3 of us shared a room and it was really spacious with enough room for all our shopping and suitcases. the bathroom was great too.we used the free internet downstairs, you get 15 mins at a time and for us that was fine, the computers were always free and more than adequate to check emails etc from home. my only minor criticism would be the breakfast, normally i wouldnt bother with breakfast in hotels in NY and indeed we had some great ones at other places during our stay, but the one at the renaissance was not great at all - expensive even by hotel standards and the quality/quantity was below average.all in all a great place to stay for a short shopping/city break trip to new york. we would definitely stay there again!"
97,1898,"Jul 3 2008 	The unfriendliess hotel I have ever had the misfortune of staying at.	I stayed at this hotel with two friends in May 2008, and the problems started immediately on arrival. Our first impressions of the hotel itself were good, it's modern and is in a great location. However, when we checked in, we were given a room with a king size bed even though we had booked a room with 2 doubles as there were 3 of us. The staff seemed totally bemused as to why this would be a problem. When we asked if we could change to a double room, we were told that there were none available as the hotel was full and that they would send up a fold away bed. We were all too tired to argue any further (it was 11.30 pm) and went off to our room.TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER and after many phone calls to the reception desk, our foldaway bed arrived without any bedding. It took another 45 minutes for that to arrive, and we were presented with a dirty quilt with no cover. We asked for a cover every day, but it never arrived. The maids (the only pleasant staff members we came into contact with) also told us that the hotel wasn't even half full, so why they chose not to give us another room is a mystery.The room itself was clean and tidy, with a great view over Times Square. We stayed on the 14th floor, and were amazed with the lack of outside noise we heard. The rudeness from the hotel staff continued throughout our stay, from the disinterested reception desk staff who refused to give any eye contact to the bar staff who huffed and tutted when we pointed out they had given us the wrong drinks order. This really ruined our stay, and made us feel totally uncomfortable.On the plus side, the cocktails at the bar are amazing, even though you have to face the wrath of the bar staff to get them. The rooms are well equipped, although the voltage is low (most US hotels are like this) and we struggled with hairdryers, hair straighteners etc. My tip would be to use the hairdryer provided rather than trying to take one from the UK. The wardrobes are huge, with plenty of hanging space and hangers, and the bathrooms are spacious and modern with towels replaced daily. The rooms were cleaned thoroughly every day, and the bathroom sparkled afterwards.Unfortunately, due to the attitude of hotel staff, I would hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, which is a shame because it offered great value for money in a wonderful city. I'll definately go back to New York, but I will take my custom somewhere else."
98,1898,"Jun 22 2008 	Good Hotel in Excellent location!	We stayed in this hotel for a weekend in June. Overall this hotel is clean and comfortable. The interactions we had with the staff were pleasant. We came in on Friday morning at 8:00am and surprisingly our room was ready. The location is in the heart of Time Square. We were on the 17th floor and with the exception of the occasional taxi horn; it was pretty quiet in the room. Actually, we heard more noise from noisy guests in the hallway than from the street. The bed is comfortable and the furnishings adequate. It has a nice 42 flat screen TV (Plasma or LCD). There also is a nice view of the street. There was no refrigerator but there was a mini-bar. The internet was $17.00 a day. You do have to go up 2 different elevators as previous reviewers have mentioned, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me, however, my husband didn't like it.Here is some information about Restaurants. We ate Breakfast at two locations near the hotel. The first was Evergreens down 48th street. They had pretty tasty breakfast and it the cost $20.00 with tip. They also have lots of seating. We had a terrible experience with Pax Whole-foods. Avoid this place like the plague. The people are rude and they overcharge you for anything additional. I got a meal with 2 eggs, toast, bacon, and hash browns for $4.95. My husband got pancakes and added a side of bacon for $6.50. We both got a glass of OJ and the total came to $20.00. I asked how much the OJ was and it was $4.25 per glass!!! $8.50 for 2 glasses of OJ!!! They only had 5 or 6 tables that were full so we didnt get to eat there and had to get it to go. My husband got 3 pancakes and they only gave him 1 small packet of pancake syrup. I asked for an additional packet and they said we would have to pay for it! In addition to the rude behavior and overpriced OJ, the food was barely edible. The pancakes were dry, they didnt fry my eggs completely (how do you mess up a fried egg?) and the toast had a terrible taste like they but rancid butter on it and warmed it on the grill. For your own sake, save your money and avoid PAX. On a positive note, Rays Pizza right beside PAX has excellent Pizza. Also, we went to a Restaurant on 9th Avenue called the Renaissance. It has a very extensive menu and excellent food for a reasonable price. Every meal I saw that came out looked terrific. For both of us it was $36.00 with tip and two non-alcoholic drinks plus the portions are huge. It was not that busy so we didnt have to wait on Saturday Night around 8:00pmOverall, I would recommend this hotel because it is nice, clean, has a great location, and friendly staff. As for the value, we stayed for free with my Marriott points so I cannot comment on the price."
99,1898,"Jun 3 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	Just returned from a Girls weekend in New York. It was our first visit and we took a long time deciding on a hotel. We were very pleased with the Renaissance. It was a super location right in the heart of Times Square. We arrived very early before 10am and we were lucky enough to have our room ready. We were very happy with this since check in isn't until 4pm. We were on the 7th floor and had a fantastic view of Times Square. The room itself was awesome! Very roomy with two very very comfortable beds. The bathroom was very nice and spotless!! Some people have complained about having to take an elevator up one floor to get to the Lobby but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. It really was no big deal. The interior of the lobby was a little funky and very modern, not something I would have picked out but that really didn't matter to me!!  I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone."
100,1898,"Jun 1 2008 	Favorite Hotel in NYC	I have stayed at this location many times. I rarely stay anyplace else while in New York on business. The staff is very accommodating and I love the atmosphere of the hotel. It is truly a laid back oasis in the middle of Times Square. Its a stereotypical NY experience to look out the window and see the glittering billboards, but I love it! I have never used the gym and the business center is actually the lobby of the sales office, but the rooms are spacious and clean with what I consider fantastic views. The doormen here are especially well versed in the area and always go above and beyond."
101,1898,"May 14 2008	Four Stars For Sure	My mother and I spent the Mothers Day weekend at this recently renovated property. Our room was on the 22nd floor with a wonderful view of Broadway. The window tilted out to open for ventilation - something I really enjoy as an alternative to a steady diet of stale, manufactured air.The room was clean, well appointed and large by New York standards. The carpet was clean and appeared to be fairly new with no worn or stained areas. The beds were as marvelous as you'd expect in a high end Marriott property. The bathroom was large, very attractive and supplied with Lather brand soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. A magnified shaving / make-up mirror was a nice addition. The shower was a real treat - glass doors, a huge shower head that produced a soft rain-like flow and a generous supply of soft, white fluffy towels. The only negative here was that the bathroom was not vented - a common fault even in the finest hotels.The recently renovated and ballyhooed lobby was a bust with me. The furniture was trendy but not overly comfortable. The music was loud and poorly chosen. We attempted to have a conversation with a friend in the lobby and ended up shouting over the obnoxious music like we had blundered into a Techno club.I'd recommend Maxie's deli on the corner of 7th avenue and 48th street. Grat sandwiches and the chocolate cappucino cheesecake is mandatory.A good stay in a wonderful hotel. As for price - let's just say that I was fortunate to be able to use my Marriott Rewards points."
102,1898,"May 8 2008 	Awesome Hotel Awesome Location	Me and my girlfriend stayed at the renaissance times square from may 2nd until the 5th, and it was awesome the room was immaculate with a awesome view and located central to everything, we will definitely be staying here again."
103,1898,"May 8 2008 	Excellent if you like Times Square	I have such mixed feelings about this hotel. I would never have chosen it since I hate noisy locations, but had to switch at the last minute due to construction at the Algonquin (my favorite). I was horrified to see the location when I got there, RIGHT ON TIMES SQUARE. You can walk out the door any time, day or night, and there are throngs of people and it looks like broad daylight. It's not really my thing, but if you like activity, you will really like this hotel. Good news: Excellent service and room. All the rooms overlook either Broadway or Seventh Avenue, and Broadway is the better view. My room, 2509, overlooked Broadway, with neon signs blinking HERSHEY M&amp;Ms outside my large windows. But you don't hear a THING. The room is completely quiet. It's oddly cozy, looking out on Times Square in your giant, fantastically comfortable bed, watching your big flat-screen TV, and you hear nothing. It grew on me quickly. I loved the desk in the room, which has two levels and plenty of room for both hubby and me to spread out our stuff and plug everything in and never get in each other's way. Large closet, nice bathroom with vessel sink, marble counter, large shower (no tub), plenty of towels, top amentities. Check-in was extremely friendly, my room was waiting for me, plus they called to see if I needed anything (we are Marriott Elite members). The location is very convenient, you are within a block of subways to take you anywhere in NY, easy walk to most theatres, excellent restaurants. One evening I was on my own for dinner, sat at the bar for a drink and an appetizer, and felt very comfortable. I was never scared to be alone at this hotel.Bad news: I hated entering and leaving the hotel in a crush of people every time. Even walking home after the theatre, getting across Times Square can take five minutes. You enter on the ground floor and have to take an elevator to the lobby level, which pulses with loud music at all hours, and then take another elevator to your room. You can't avoid the lobby. But the restaurant on this level is far enough away that you can't hear this music if you eat there. I didn't eat there, but it looked very nice and has great views of Times Square.On balance, I would never return to this hotel because I like a quieter location, but I did enjoy my stay because of the convenience and the lovely room and the view of Broadway."
104,1898,"May 6 2008	Great Stay	Renaissance Hotel &amp; Times Square, a winning combination.Room very comfortable, staff very friendly. If you are going to New York then this is the best location to stay and this has to be one of the best hotels."
105,1898,"May 4 2008 	Gorgeous hotel in a wonderful location!!!	Hotel was GORGEOUS!! Everything was very modern and looked newly updated. Room was big and very clean. Bathroom was nice and I liked the deep tub for taking a bath. I was very impressed with the hotel overall for the price i paid. We only stayed one night, but would definitely stay there again. The location could not have been better."
106,1898,"Apr 30 2008 	Comfortable and LOCATION!	Remember that this website is terrific for gathering OPINIONS! Yes, I have one too. :)I will do my best to keep this objective in terms of the hotel's positives and negatives.First, we had NO PROBLEM with the hotel or its staff.Honestly, this hotel is in a GREAT location. TIMES SQUARE! Woo hoo! Close to everything.... very important.The beds were heavenly to sleep on. The check in was fine and we had to wait before our room was ready, but we were the ones who arrived EARLY - so we simply left our bags with the bellhop and off we went to explore for a good place to eat.Don't eat at the hotel - get OUT there! See what the Big Apple has to offer.Try dining at the Rockefeller Plaza Cafe (right there where people normally skate in the winter time, becomes a great little outdoor bistro during the spring, summer and fall). Go indoors if you prefer -be ready to spend some NY dollars, but OH SO GOOD and worth it!I barely spent any time in the hotel, but the moments that I was there, I was comfortable and the place was very clean.Modern art deco is not my preference, but those feather pillows and beds WERE. Our room had a view of the lights of Times Square (we could see 'A CHORUS LINE' lighting up the streets directly outside our window). However, as soon as the curtains were closed, it was pitch black. The sound of traffic and noise from the street was minimal -considering it is NEW YORK CITY!!The only downsize was the noise from the inside hallways - I had a difficult time sleeping the first night due to a couple of our neighbors slamming their door s (although I don't think it was intentional, the doors just closed quickly) and talking loud in the hallway before retiring for the evening. That is just because some people are rude - not because the hotel had anything to do with the attitudes of other travelers!Overall, great experience, terrific location. CLEAN and COMFY. Size of room was perfect for two weary travelers who needed to sleep after touring up and down Manhattan."
107,1898,"Apr 20 2008 	Cold sleek weird decor nice rooms though	As someone else noted- weird entrance. I do not like that you have to take an elevator to another elevator to get to your room. The front desk doesn't look like a front desk... more like a restaurant host desk... So it was a bit confusing. The decor is something like a perverted spaceship design... you have to see it to belive it... and I wasn't the only one who noticed it. The rooms were very nice and clean. I had no problem with any services. It was a clean nice room. So, if you like very modern, with nice room you will be happy.Location is terrific."
108,1898,"Apr 18 2008 	Great location for tourists!	We stayed at the Renaissance for 7 nights from Nov. 6 - 13, using Marriott Reward points. My wife had never been to New York, so we went and did all the usual tourist things -- Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Central Park (spectacular), La Traviata at the Met, Wicked (2 days before the strike!), Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Spectacular with the Rockettes, etc etc.We were disappointed that the Renaissance had not completed its renovations as originally scheduled, so the construction in the lobby took away from the experience, but we still enjoyed our stay. As other reviewers have noted, the entrance is a 2-step process, with an odd little elevator entrance and then the real reception area and elevators to the rooms on the second floor. We had a newly remodeled room on the 16th floor, which was big by New York standards, and which had nice amenities, such as the comfy bed, attractive and usable bathroom (with a nice touch -- housekeeping wiped Rain-X or some similar product in a circle in the center of the mirror each day so it did not fog up after a shower), and good TV.The remodeled public areas were being finished in a sort of &quot;retro modern&quot; -- lots of plastic and round baubles and space age touches -- not really our taste for a NY hotel, but also not so bad that we would not go there. (The restaurant seemed pretty pricey, so we did not eat there, especially with so many other choices in the area. We did have the tourist cocktail at the Marriott Marquis across the street, which was fun -- we sat in the revolving bar for at the top of the Marquis for at least 3 revolutions -- a definite treat for anyone who wants to enjoy a drink and an unusual view over the lights of the city.)Besides the central location with easy walking access to everything and close by subway entrances, the highlight of the hotel was Omar, the concierge. He recommended several outstanding restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. We told him that we wanted good food at a reasonable price in places that he would go or take relatives. Every suggestion was spot on.Although we can't really speak to the value of the rooms since we used Reward points, we would definitely stay at the Renaissance again."
109,1898,"Apr 12 2008 	Loved Times Sq.	Excellant hotel to capture the Times Sq. experience. The recent remodel makes for a comfortable and trendy designs.The staff was very helpful and knowledgable.Pricey, but well worth the cost."
110,1898,"Apr 3 2008	DISAPPOINTED	We recently stayed in the Renaissance in New York and were quite disappointed in it. We booked a room on a higher floor, at an additional cost, so thought we would get a better room. Our room was extremely small, even by Manhattan standards and the room cleaning service was spotty at best. We had difficulties with our internet, as it disconnected after 3 days, even though we bought a 6-day package; hotel staff were unable to assist with this. Note: internet connection was included with the room; therefore, this had to be manually removed from our bill upon checkout. Also, there were no complimentary bathrobes in the room, which in most better quality hotels are a standard feature.If you are looking for a little luxury, you will not find it here, if you are looking for value for money, you will not find it here.From all accounts the hotel had gone through renovations and we could not get a good sense of what the theme was suppose to be, although I think the designer was going for trendy, edgy. The Concierge was helpful in finding a taxi and storing our luggage.We will not be staying here on any return trips to New York."
111,1898,"Apr 2 2008	Wonderful experience friendly staff	We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. All the staff we encountered from the bellmen to front desk staff were extremely courteous and friendly. The room we stayed in was very quiet, soundproof, we didn't hear any street noise. The room was immaculately clean. The bathroom is fairly decently sized for NYC standards."
112,1898,"Mar 31 2008 	Overpriced and Unfriendly	Left this property this morning and we feel we were over paid. There are much better option in NYC. The positives: The location (if you want to be near time square) is very central and literally on top of a subway stop. The property is very new and the facility reflects this through its cleanliness.The Negatives: The front desk staff are not just unfriendly but out right rude and unresponsive to simple requests. Though Marriott pledges smoke free properties our room stunk of Cigarettes  which we complained about and received an Oh! Thats unfortunate. The walls between rooms are paper thin (note an earlier review mentions sound proof rooms and soaking tubs  they must have the wrong hotel!). The rooms are not cleaned well  at check in we found a babys pacifier, old newspapers and food wrapper under the bed. The hotel staff makes no effort to recognize participants in Marriotts Reward program (We are Platinum Elite Level Members and are usually greeted by the Hotel Manager at check-in and upgraded to a suite without even having to ask) . Upon check in at 4PM not all of our rooms (we had three rooms at $375.00 each (including tax)) were ready and were told to come back later. When our rooms were ready, non where on concierge level (there may not even be a concierge level)(nor was a concierge lounge available to us) or upgraded rooms and we were treated as if we were a bothering the front desk staff by just being at the hotel (note that the doormen and valets were very nice, but not the front desk).  I found the hotel layout less than convenient. To get from your room to the street you need to take the elevator to the Lobby, walk across the lobby (being stared at by the front desk staff who face the elevators) and then get into another elevator which takes you to the ground floor  this process not only takes time but allows for no privacy with the rude desk staff watching your comings and goings. Finally, the people in the room beside us were extremely loud. Which I can tolerate to a certain point. The second night, the people in the room next door were very loud and we needed to get up early. It was after midnight and we called the front desk to complain. They sent security up, security came up and told the people in the next room to keep it down because we (our room specifically) had complained which only made the situation worse  the people in the next room proceeded to pound on our wall and talk at the top of their longs for the next two hours  security never bothered to pass by again as far as I could tell. We just gave up at this point and watched tv. This place is not horrible  but I think there are much nicer places that treat its guest like valued guests and charge the same or less. Try the Westin or W on or near Time Square  I have stayed at both and felt good about spending my money at those properties. I appreciate a hotel property that appreciates its guests. This property does not!"
113,1898,"Mar 24 2008 	WoW what an Amazing stay at the Renaissance	Just got back from a 6 night stay at the renaissance. The hotel is in a great location right in the heart of all the action of times square! The hotel staff are helpful &amp; friendly. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. The pillows and duvet in the hugh bed are lush!! The bathroom had a big walkin shower with very modern fittings.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay here again if i travelled back to New York."
114,1898,"Mar 13 2008	Liked it better than the Marriott Marquis	I stayed for two evenings in early March and really liked this hotel. As a means of comparison, I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis, Marriott East Side and Marriott Courtyard Times Square South as well. I would rank this hotel as the best bet for your tourist dollar if you really value full service, with the Courtyard (and excellent value) right behind. This has a great, clubby &quot;W&quot; feel to it, and I really like the rooms. You don't get the view of Times Square that you would from the Marriott, but I didn't miss it after being there many times. Renovations are complete, and it is very well done. For dinner, try Tony Di Napoli. I had a great meal there prior to a show. Good luck with your stay, you can't go wrong with any of the hotels but this is a nice property than the Marquis if you have &quot;been there, done that&quot;."
115,1898,"Mar 12 2008	One of the NYC Hotels That I've Been	The location of this hotel was excellent, only one block from a subway station and a few blocks from the Times Sq. stop. I had a king size room on the 12th floor. The bed was amazingly comfortable with lots of pillows and a douvet. I liked the big walk-in shower, glsss doors, seat in the shower. This is not the postage stamp size bathroom in most NYC hotel rooms. The complimentary shoe shine service was professional. The room was very clean and comfortable, large plasma screen TV, and we had a great view from the window. Yje lobbies are funky and tasteful. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay."
116,1898,"Mar 7 2008	Great stay at the Renaissance	The location of the hotel was excellent, only one block from a subway station. We had a king size room on the 8th floor. The room was very clean and comfortable and we had a great view from the window. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the standard of food there. Loved this hotel and am planning to go back next year."
117,1898,"Mar 3 2008 	Loved the Renaissance	We have always stayed down at the Renaissance primarily for its location. Since they have remodeled the rooms they are excellent. All the beds and bathrooms have been updated.I always request a room with the view of Broadway. They have a great lounge area and while we were there another lounge was under construction. The only down fall of staying at this hotel is the restaurant, Chop Suey. There were 10 of us eating there and none of us could find something to eat. We ended up all leaving and having dinner at the Olive Garden. The front desk was great about helping us find different restaurants as well as making reservations (which at most places its required.) This is my favorite hotel out of all the Marriott's!"
118,1898,"Feb 28 2008 	Best location on Times Square	Spent just one night at this hotel for dinner and a show so location and a nice hotel room were important. This hotel could not be situated in a better location for the WOW feeling of Times Square ; located on the tiny triangle of land where Broadway and &amp; 7th avenue intersect, so neat location. Very, very busy hustle bustle area so if not familiar may feel overwhelming. Hotel entrance is a smallish area with funky decor and blue vinyl (maybe leather) sofas where the bellman desk is. Must go up elevator to get to the main floor where the small check in desk is. This main lobby is very dark, and furnished very modernly and coldly but interesting. The furnishings and decor are a bit odd but fun for a night or two. The theme seems to be body parts some of the decor obvious and some more subliminal. The hotel feels lacking in amenities but we weren't looking for any so I could be wrong. Just an overall feeling that all the public facilites ie restaurant and bar are all on one small floor on either side of the tiny check in area. Everything we did was outside of the hotel so again, there may have been more to the hotel than we saw.Our room was great, overlooking Broadway. Lots of bright lights all night long out there but the curtains do a great job of blocking all light. Very little noise came up to us on the 6th floor. The beds are fabulous, we actually slept until 11AM and had no idea we were sleeping in so late. Great big flat screen tv, mini bar, a whole system for video games, computers etc... We did not use it so not sure of all its functions. The marble bathroom was beautiful. Shower only but huge, glassed in with a sitting area. Gorgeous unique blue, metallic and earth tone tiles (hard to decscribe) in the shower that I would love to have at home. Very comfortable room and bathroom.Hotel was full but we checked in a bit earlier than the 4pm check in with no problems.Bell staff were very pleasant and helpful.Would definitely stay at this hotel again for a night or two due to its location and great rooms and the interesting atmosphere. Don't know if I could stay longer than a couple days though as it is very dark in the lobby area and feels a bit somber."
119,1898,"Feb 21 2008 	Pros and Cons	While we had a visit to NYC, there were a few things lacking from this hotel. We did give them the benefit of the doubt that they were not 100% done with renovations. We had a great location and a good price (due to being Rewards members) so all in all a pleasant stay.It is aggravating to have to take 2 different elevators to your room each time.The rooms are nice sized for NYC with a lot of new amenities. No bathrobes, which was surprising for a 4 star hotel. Our &quot;room guide&quot; was missing most of its pages, including all menus, so when we called room service it took a bit longer to place our order. Room service was very prompt, courteous, and delicious. I was surprised to not see an Ipod docking clock radio since those are all the rage at hotels now, but there was a nice flat screen tv and business center hook up area.Beds were very comfy, lots of extra pillows and the chaise lounge in great.The mini bar is electronic, but things fell out every time we opened it. So far, haven't seen a charge, so I guess we put them back quickly enough. The bathroom fan didn't work , and the shower stall door did not close. We didn't discover this until we were well settled in so didn't want to move rooms.Since we knew these were issues that could involve a maintenance man coming into the room for extended periods of time, we chose to ignore the problems and enjoy our stay instead.Our tiling was also crooked in the bathroom. Since it's pretty much what you stare at while in the shower, it was a bit funny. I wonder if they &quot;hurried up&quot; some rooms to meet their renovation deadline?We were asked what newspaper we preferred in the mornings, said the NY Times and got USA today. These are all little nitpicky items, but wanted to give an accurate review. I contacted the hotel more as an FYI instead of a complaint to let them know. But based on location and price ($200 a night for us) we were happy. If we had paid the rack rate of $400+, I might have voiced my concerns more loudly."
120,1898,"Feb 4 2008 	Not as Good as Expected	Have been wanting to stay at this hotel for some time, having heard some good things about it. Spent 2 nights from Jan. 25-27. Decided to use Marriott points to stay at this hotel. Almost all the Marriott hotels in the Big Apple require the maximum number of points for one night. Otherwise, the nightly rate at the Renaissance would be $300. Even though I had read enough reviews of the Renaissance, I was still surprised when I arrived. For example, this hotel has a really small entrance, then you take the elevator up to the first floor, which is partly dark, since there is a lounge area right next to check-in..I was initially given a room on the 22nd floor, which has a view of Sixth Avenue as well as other tall buildings, but not a whole lot to see.. I didn't like the room being connected to another room, so I went and asked for one that didn't have a connecting door. Front desk was kind of in disbelief that this was the reason I wanted a room change. Frankly, hotels should not have any opinion as to why guests prefer specific rooms. If a guest prefers a specific room, they have a good reason why. A good hotel will go out of their way to give you the room you want, without acting like they think you're crazy.Check-in area was really small, more like a ticket booth instead of reception. Maybe they are still in the renovation phase."
121,1898,"Jan 29 2008 	New Year's Eve overlooking Times Square at the Renaissance	We did a 4 week tour of the USA over December/January 2007, with 3 older children (girl, 22, boy, 19 and boy, 18), going to San Francisco [Omni Hotel], Miami (South Beach) [Beacon Hotel], Orlando (Disneyworld, Pop Century Resort), Chicago [Drake Hotel], New York (for Christmas) [Beacon Hotel  no relation to the one in Miami], Boston [Omni Hotel], New York (again) [Roosevelt Hotel], and a day trip to Niagara Falls. It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids.Anyway, this review is about New Years Eve 2007/2008 at the Renaissance Hotel overlooking Times Square in New York.We were always going to be in NY for NYE, but I'd made no plans other than some vague notion of Times Square. A wise person advised me that &quot;you just don't go to Times Square for New Year's Eve. There are a million people there. They start lining up at 10.00am. The police close off the streets at about 3.00pm, and you can't get it after that. There are no toilets. If you leave to get food or drink, you won't get back in. It's freezing cold and you'll be there until after midnight. You need to book a restaurant or somewhere.&quot;.From what I saw at the time, I can say in hindsight that he was absolutely correct in everything he said.So I started tooling around on the internet, and googled something like &quot;New Year's Eve in Time Square&quot;. There were quite a few sites devoted to it; some highlighting venues that had functions that night. I was restricted in my choice, as many venues were only open to those over 21 (and I have 2 who weren't).One of those referred to was the Renaissance Hotel.I emailed the Hotel, and my contact, Michelle Galindo, was brilliant in her attention and organisation. Prompt email replies, confirmations, explanations, and phone contact. She arranged for a package to be delivered to our hotel, which included the formal invitation and, essentially, passes through the numerous police cordons which worked a charm. In the last stretch, we even had a police escort to the door of the Renaissance.The venue was unbeatable. It overlooked Times Square, and looked right down it's throat to the signs at the other end, where the famous ball dangled. The restaurant is actually part of the neon sign structure at the opposite end of Times Square. Unless you know it's there, it's almost invisible. It seats about 80 people. We had a table of 7. I cannot imagine that there is a better, more comfortable spot to watch it all unfold.The dinner was stunning - 5 star. There was an open bar, and Veuve Clique champagne with your hors derves ( we even received commemorative champagne glasses to keep). A live band played. Party favours.The one thing to note - it is expensive. I mean really expensive. I won't give away the price - if you're interested, you'll find out. Just make sure you are sitting down.But if you can get over the cost, and simply want the best New Year's Eve celebrations overlooking Times Square, then check out the Renaissance Hotel."
122,1898,"Jan 21 2008 	Nice place	Just came back from a 2 night stay at this hotel. We got one of the just remodel rooms, they are HUGE by NYC standarts. It was very clean, conftable with a very modern look . The bathroom had a lot of space with a big shower. The location is very good if you like the very &quot;touristy&quot;, my wife loves it, y personally like to stay more uptown when we are in NYC. I have no complaints of any kind abou the hotel and would stay here again in te future."
123,1898,"Jan 15 2008 	Perfect	Stayed her from januari 1 for two nights.Room on the 24 floor overlooking Broadway / Duffysquare.Verry nice and clean new room. Large shower, no bathtub.They were finishing the complete overhaul off the hotel.Service was ok, friendly staff. The restaurant has a great view over Times Square. We had breakfast, service was ok buth the quality of the food didn't match our expectations. Nothing special average quality.When we return to New York we will definitly consider staying here again."
124,1898,"Jan 14 2008 	Loved it! - Great for New Years Eve	HAd a great stay at the renaissance - we arrived new years eve - the best views of times square! Room was lovely - bed was the best I have ever slept on! We were on the 16th floor with side views of times square - All staff were great - the position is the best - easy walk to most attractions - only 10 min walk to Saks and Rockafeller , 5 min walk to see Color Purple and A Chorus Line, the only negative was the room service was average but the rest was fabulous!"
125,1898,"Jan 13 2008 	Renaissance Times Square - A Big Hit!	I just returned from celebrating my best friends birthday in NYC! I got us tickets to an off-broadway show and wanted to spend the night. I was using my Marriott points and originally was staying at the one on Lexington because I new it. I am so glad I changed and stayed at the Renaissance in Times Square! They have redone ALL of the rooms and they are gorgeous! Our check-in was speedy and our room was exactly what I wanted. Two double beds on a high floor. Huge flat screen TV, very clean and huge bathroom for New York. I was told that if you get two doubles there is a shower and bath. The king rooms only have a shower. The bar in the hotel is very cool and the bar tender is great. The decor in the lobby areas is very unique. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel."
126,1898,"Jan 2 2008 	Makeover successful - great service great location.	The Renaissance hotel in Times Square (on 7th, by the Broadway and 7th split) has recently been renovated. You enter on the ground floor where the concierge\bag check is located, but the lobby is one floor up - the wait for the elevator is probably the only complaint I had at this hotel. The ground floor entrance way has been redecorated in a 60's mod theme, with blue molded chairs and chrome body parts on the wall as art. Thankfully, the lobby/bar upstairs is warm and inviting.We did not avail ourselves of the bar, but it hummed with activitiy, and the guests seemed to be enjoying themselves. The lobby also has three internet screens available.The service is exceptional, the staff is friendly - they even remembered our name after meeting just the once. Pretty impressive given the number of guests. There was a fairly long line to check in, but the service was efficient and the line moved quickly.The room we received was on the 11th floor, with a view of Times Square. The room itself was huge for NYC standards, and very clean. There is a small window that can be opened partially for room ventiliation - which we enjoyed, given it was an unusually warm day in the city, and the room was initially a bit stuffy. It was around 50 degrees, which seemed to confuse the room air conditioner, which poured out warm air into the room. Opening the window helped refresh the room, but you do hear all of the street noise - fine for when you are awake, but we needed to close the window to sleep. The air conditioner did better the next day, cooling the room to our desired temperature.We requested and received a room with 2 beds - and a large bathtub/shower combo - with a curtain railing bowed out to provide more arm room. The shower itself was very nice with plenty of hot water pressure - and for me one of the most important amenities - a light in the shower. The bathroom was also pretty large for NYC, and had been made over with granite top and warm colors. Like the room, the bathroom was immaculate. We noticed other rooms on our floor with 1 single King bed had walk-in stall showers and no tub. The room has a large wooden closet with iron/board, extra pillows, shoe shine basket, wooden hangers (that actually come off the rod) and dry cleaning service bags. We also had a coffee service table and mini-fridge with bar. There was a room safe - but not in the closet as most, but in a pull out drawer. The beds are comfy, with fine clean white linens and feather comforters with duvet covers. Plenty of pillows. For such a large, busy hotel, the room was very quiet - no hall or elevator noise.Everything in the room worked - the TV, all the lights. There is a combination radio\CD\clock player in the room. The room has internet connections available, and a large board on which you can connect a portable DVD player to the TV. There's also a pull out work desk station.The location of the hotel is great, with subway station access uptown and downtown just a few doors down. There are all of the restaurants and theaters of Times Square, and just a few blocks walk to Rockefeller Center.All in all we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return."
127,1898,"Dec 27 2007 	Liked it!!	Stayed overnight in NYC because I had opera tickets for Saturday night. Would have preferred closer to Lincoln Center but this place was on the northern block ending Times Square. Very funky inside--I liked that a lot. I heard it has just been renovated and it looks great. Bathroom was lovely with colorful tiles in the shower. Large flat screen TV and nice cushy Simmons pillowtop mattresses. The blue headboard did not go in the neutral-colored room. The location is very good. Noisy late into the a.m. though so bring your earplugs! If you have a room with an adjoining door, be aware you will hear the people in the next room very clearly. I would stay here again."
128,1898,"Dec 26 2007 	Great location.	We stayed at the Renaissance Hotel from 19th - 22nd December. The location in Times Square is fabulous. The staff were friendly and helpful (with one exception which the management dealt with swiftly and courteously). The rooms were clean and felt spacious. The beds andpillows incredibly comfortable!! The view of Times Square from the Restaurant is a real bonus. The renovations were almost complete when we were there but certainly didn't bother us. The hotel was happy to accommodate a late check out and stored our bags whilst we squeezed in a performance of Chicago before heading for the airport. Tip - if like us you have four in your party and quite a few bags (!) the hotelorganised a large people carrier to take us back to JFK which was far more luxurious than a yellow cab and didn't cost that much more.The trip was to celebrate my son's 18th birthday and there were four of us in our party - me, my husband, my son and his girlfriend. The hotel was loved by us all - it is stylish and modern. I recommend cocktails at the bar! Would definitely return."
129,1898,"Dec 12 2007 	Not Quite Finished but Nice	Bellman were nice and service was excellent. We got there early so we expected that are room might not be ready and it wasn't. Due to their renovations, the lobby is half of its intended size and very crowded. It looks like it will be nice once it is finished, but right now it is barely functional. We went out into the city for a while and came back and our room was ready. The room is new and very nice. The only dissapointing thing about the rooms is that there are no good views of time square because the face of the hotel is covered with signs. It also was dissapointing that there is nowhere to have a drink overlooking Time Square. The lobby has no view. I guess I am spoiled by the Marriott Marquis. Other than that the service was excellent and staff very nice and helpful."
130,1898,"Dec 9 2007 	Nice Place - Great Location	This place is really nice, and in the middle of Times Square. Probably the one of the best locations of any hotel in Times Square. The rooms are very nice, and big for New York City. The place was very clean, and the staff was always friendly and helpful. I recommend this hotel to anyone staying, whether for business or for pleasure, if you want to be in the heart of Times Square."
131,1898,"Dec 9 2007 	great location but expensive	We stayed here for one night - the first Saturday in December.We were meeting up with relatives who were staying in a hotel on Times Square, so decided to stay close to them.The renaissance was very expensive - over $700 for the one nightI know it was peak season etc, but we still thought it very expensive for what was a very nice, but nothing extra special hotel.The location was fabulous, great views from the 8th floor, good soundproofing, smart new decor. Check in service was good. We were able to check in early (around 10am), normal check in is at 4pm. We had also requested a &quot;feather free &quot; room. This was provided promptly.The negatives were - no bath, only a shower.Also, having to take our own luggage down from our room, via reception, using 2 lifts, at peak checkout time. Very busy and crowded, queueing to use the lifts etc.When we had called to use the &quot;quick checkout facility &quot; the phone wasn't being answered. Calling for help with our luggage we were told to make our own way down to the ground floor using the 2 lifts. I know it was peak time etc, but I would have thought it more efficient (and pleasant for all concerned) if staff had taken our suitcases in a service lift (as I presume they had when we arrived, which was very efficient)."
132,1898,"Dec 7 2007 	Great location and service	I have just got back from a 4 day stay and have to say the hotel is great, service is great and the rooms are wonderful. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful, especially the guys on reception nothing was too much trouble. If I was coming back to New York i would book here again. The hotel is in a great location and easy to reach everywhere by taxi or the underground."
133,1898,"Dec 6 2007	Superb Room and location	This place is great!!! The hotel has just undergone a renovation and the rooms are beautiful and very large by New York standards. The staff are very friendly and helpful and go way beyond the call of duty. I left some clothes in the dresser and didn't realize it until I got home. I called back to the hotel, and the staff in &quot;lost and found&quot; retrieved my clothes, boxed them up, and overnighted them to me at no charge. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE!!!! Also the Time Square location is extremely convenient to the theaters and tons of other attractions. There is a subway station just outside the door as well. You definitely won't go wrong with this super hotel!!!!"
134,1898,"Dec 5 2007 	Great Location	So I had a single night in New York before I headed upstate for a conference and decided that Times Square was the place to be. Unfortunately, staying in Manhattan on the first saturday of December was always going to be expensive, but I didn't realise how expensive it would be!The taxi driver managed to get lost (how is this possible for a taxi driver to get lost going between JFK and Times Square?), but eventually I spotted the single door leading to the hotel's lobby. Or at least, I thought it was the lobby. Due to the nature of the location, the ground floor is just an entrance, and an elevator is required to get to the lobby. I was checked in within 30 seconds and up to my King Room. I had a great view of a scrolling ticker out of my window (what else in Times Square), but the curtains were thick enough to block out all light. The room was very pleasant with a comfortable bed, clean and crisp bedding and a large and powerful shower. Internet access was charged at $17 per day which i thought was a bit expensive considering the price of the room, and it was also wired (ethernet cable was present in the room). One thing that may help others, was that the network connection on the desk was part of a multiplug that also had connectors for DVI and HDMI. I presume these led to the large LCD TV so anyone travelling with a laptop full of movies could theoretically play them on the TV, or fine tune any business presentations on a big screen - quite a plus. Unfortunately, having a MacMini meant I had left my $30 adapter back at home and could neither test nor use this facility.The location was excellent and I went for a walk in the evening to take a look around. The large Christmas tree in the Rockefeller Plaza was about 10 minutes away, as was 5th Avenue. 10 minutes walking south got me to the huge Macy's (where I got lost) and also to the Empire State building. Even though I was on the 7th floor, the hotel was suitably soundproofed and no noise from Times Square entered my room.The staff were most helpful in every way and are happy to mind your luggage upon checking our (which is 12:00 by the way) should you want to look around the city before you head off to another destination. In addition, the staff downstairs can provide advice for locations, dining and the best way to get to another location. In my case, they recommended against getting a cab upstate and called their own driver who took my to my next destination. Friendly and very efficient service!All in all, a very pleasant experience and I would recommend this hotel to anyone if the rooms are a little less expensive (which I believe they are given a different date). It has been recently modernised and won't be to everyone's taste, but as a very pleasant room in the centre of Manhattan, it is fine. I would have rated it as excellent apart from the cost."
135,1898,"Dec 2 2007 	Great stay great location	We had read some of the reviews and were a little worried about the renovations taking place, but we arrived on a Friday and left on the Monday evening and only the only evidence of renovations was painting in the lobby area on the Monday morning, so I think the renovations must be mostly finished. Hotel staff were all very helpful, our flight to come home wasn't until 9pm so we asked about a later check out this was arranged for 2pm, then security staff looked after our suitcases until 6pm when we needed to head off for the airport.The beds are lovely, very large and comfortable. The view from the room was great considering I had been told that you're very lucky to find a hotel room in New York that doesn't look out onto a brick wall (like our friends who had stayed at the Waldorf Astoria). Rooms were clean and spacious.Would certainly go back to this hotel, if nothing else because of the convenient location."
136,1898,"Dec 2 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	We stayed at this hotel 22nd - 27th November 2007. When we arrived we were greeted by very helpful and friendly reception staff and went straight up our room. Our room was on the 19th floor and was beautiful, it was very spacious and the bed was huge. We had a great view over times square. That evening the reception staff sent up some champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a card as we were newlyweds.This hotel is very near completion but the lobby, seating area downstairs and all public areas were at a very high standard. There was free internet access downstairs which came in handy when we were up at 3am because of the time difference in the UK! We had a look at the restaurant which had fabulous views over times square but did not get the opportunity to use it.As the fitness room is not yet finished we were able to use the fitness room at the Marriot Marquis across the road free of charge.I was a little dubious after reading some reviews but was very glad that we stayed with this hotel and would most definitely book again. The majority of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of times square, I am looking forward to visiting again to see its completion."
137,1898,"Dec 1 2007 	Maybe it will get better	When we first arrived in the room we thought it was great. Nice and clean, furnished well and plenty of room. But then we noticed what looked liked bodily fluids on the spreads (bleach white so I'm not sure how they missed it). It might not have been something else but it looked like it and made me uncomfortable. We reported it and they only changed one but left a nice bottle of champaign and chocolate covered cherries for us. That sort of made up for it but over the next few days we came to be really disappointed. The main problem was the guests and cleaning staff slamming doors, which made the front door in our room shake and the joining rooms door rattle. A couple of times they slammed it so loud it made me jump straight out of the bed! With all of the renovations I can't understand why they didn't do better with the doors. We tried for two days to get the front desk to ask them to stop but to no avail. The walls are extremely thin, as well. We could hear the people next door putting their clothes in the drawers and closets. Honestly, if it weren't for the issue with the door slamming I wouldn't mind going back but would never pay that kind of money again to be inconvenienced. The restaurant has a GREAT view! Someone rented it out for the Macy's Parade and they gave us a nice hot breakfast to go free."
138,1898,"Nov 29 2007	Almost Done...	The hotel has undergone a huge &quot;beautifucation&quot;, but isn't quite there yet. Thank goodness for the so-far slow holiday season. There would be some pretty upset folks! The rooms were guaranteed at 100% done, but weren't. Mismatched furniture, reverse hot and cold water, not a clean room...But the new decor that's either there or coming is outstanding. Keep up the good work. And the bell staff should teach the rest of the hotel about customer service...they were OUTSTANDING. Hit this hotel in a couple of months when the now-closed fitness center is done and the staff has a proper desk to welcome guests. It's all a bit transitional at the moment."
139,1898,"Nov 17 2007 	Disappointed this time with Renaissance	We have stayed at the Renaissance for years, several times a year, and have always loved it, but this time was a true disappointment. The renovations to the lobbies and the work on the elevators were very inconvenient. It meant lining up for the elevator every time you had to use it to go in or out or up to the rooms. Only one elevator up to the rooms was working for most of the visit. There was lots of noise and ducking under ladders and scaffolding. One night all of the elevators were out of order at just the time everyone was leaving for the theatre. Having to walk down all those flights then wind our way through dank hallways to an outside exit was very unpleasant. The old staffers who were there were still helpful and friendly but the hotel had many new staff and they were not helpful nor were they friendly. The reno to the restaurant is disappointing. Tables are crammed in close together and the tiered seating is gone so the view isn't as good. We had to wait 20 minutes one morning to get in for breakfast and when they finally took us in, several tables were empty! No idea why we had to wait. Even the housekeeping wasn't as good as usual. Turn down service came at around 4 in the afternoon, way too early. Room service trays from the previous night were still there when we left our rooms mid-morning. Just a very disappointing stay, and to top it all off, the price for the rooms was higher, by far, than it ever was before!"
140,1898,Nov 17 2007 	great location	The hotel lobby was being renovated but it did not cause any problems with check in etc. We booked one of the larger corner rooms which had just been renovated and it was a really nice room with a great view over Times Square. There was no bath but a lovely large shower and compared to other bathrooms we have seen in New York it was really spacious and of course brand new after the renovations etc. Would recommend this hotel as it is in such a great location. They also have a computer and printer in the lobby dedicated to on-line airline check-in and to print off your boarding cards - very useful.
141,1898,"Nov 16 2007 	Great location large room huge bed and great view	I booked the trip to New York for my wife's 40th Birthday as a surprise and wanted a really good central location and the Renaissance seemed to fit the bill perfectly.It's a strange entrance for such a big hotel. You needed to go up in the lift to the main lobby. The staff were friendly (although not as helpful as I have come to expect from US hotel staff).The room was amazing. The bed was HUGE and the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Problem is I have never been able to replicated the comfort since.The bathroom was a nice size and finished in marble, whichI thought was a nice touch.The restaurant was amazing and if you like seafood you have found heaven. For breakfast there is every choice you can imagine and it's so quiet you can forget you are in such a vibrant city. The view from the restaurant is amazing and I found you didn't want to rush your meal.The location is second to none, with the hotel located right in the middle of Time Square. And what a location!Am going back in Feb, but this time we are not staying at this hotel. Not really by choice. The children want to come this time and economies have mean't downgrading our hotel choice.I would definitely recommend this hotel (although renovations have started since my trip there)"
142,1898,"Nov 15 2007	Comfortable and Friendly	We just returned from an excellent stay at the Renaissance. I had read some recent reviews before we left and I was curious as to what we would encounter, well those reviewers who found the staff to be unhelpfull or unfriendly must of had a shift working that we never encountered, eveyone was pleasant and helpfull. Even though the hotel is under renovations things were quite , clean and yes it may take a little longer navigating the elevators but once you get into the habit of changing cars it isn't a problem. The bed is by far the most comfortable I've slept in. There is a small market across the street that has fresh cut fruit, panninis and salads, very tasty and very affordable, better than anything else in the area for breakfast."
143,1898,"Nov 11 2007 	Best Birthday spent here	Last year as a birthday retreat my mother booked a trip to this particular hotel. When we arrived we were smack dab in the middle of the hussle and bussle of Times Square! We only spent a weekend here, but the hotel was wonderful!The bed's were so nice you never wanted to leave it's warmth. The room was fine except our bathtub leaked water but otherwise everything was up to par. Eating breakfast while viewing Times Square was breath taking even though the breakfast wasnt anything special.The concierge was very polite and I loved the lobby. This hotel is very elegant yet not too stuffy for a regular traveler like myself. I would love to visit here again."
144,1898,"Nov 8 2007 	The most comfortable bed in the world!	I took my fiance to NY for his 30th birthday and stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. I had read the previous reviews and was torn between booking the hotel, as they were very mixed reviews. Having stayed at the hotel, I can confirm and disprove some of the previous reviews.Firstly, yes there are renovations, and it is inconvenient to have to take 2 elevators to reach your room. However it is understandable why they have to do this, and once renovations are complete, this will no longer be an issue.Next, breakfast. It does indeed take a long time to get breakfast; and if you were in a hurry, I would recommend getting breakfast early. However, the food and the view do make up for the slow service.The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful. Even at 4 in the morning, when we checked in due to a delay in our flight. There were no complaints in this department. The bedroom. What can I say about the bed? It was the best bed I have ever slept in. So much so, I am now throwing out all my old duvets and pillows and topper to buy new bedding to try and replicate the sensation of sleeping on clouds. Other reviews have commented on how comfortable the beds are and I have to fully agree with them. With regards the bathroom, we did have a soap dish and a bin in the bathroom. The rooms are clean and comfortable. One piece of advice is in the mini bar, if you rearrange your fridge to fit in your own drinks, you might get accidentally charged for items, as the mini bar uses sensors to track what you take.The location is excellent, with a metro station right outside the hotel.All in all the hotel is very nice."
145,1898,"Nov 5 2007 	Nice with a few hiccups....	The hotel was very nice, however, there were some annoying things about staying there. Most of the problems were due to the renovations that are currently going on. It's a pain to take two different elevators to get up to your room. We also had &quot;Gold status&quot;, and normally that comes with a private room where you can grab a quick continental breakfast. With this hotel, you literally have to take the time to be sat and you are required to order off the menu. That is fine when you aren't in a hurry, but we happen to be in one.The last thing (And this is very minor, but I'm going to mention it anyway) is that there wasn't a soap holder, and every time you washed your hands and sat the soap down, it would slide off the sink and onto the counter. Just little things like that could have been thought of, when they did the designing. They also didn't think to put a garbage can in the bathroom either. Overall, it was a great place to stay. Especially the location. And if you can get away without staying there until the renovations are done, then I would definitely recommend this hotel."
146,1898,"Oct 24 2007	Very comfortable	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel - the best bits were:1. Location - right in the heart of the action.2. Most comfortable bed I have slept in.3. Superb concierge staff, very knowledgeable and helpful.However, the reception staff were pretty frosty. I had booked four nights with them on their own website, and when we arrived we were told that we had only booked for two, luckily I had copies of all the emails etc with me. Also, the day we were leaving, they gave me a final invoice on which they had charged us $200 per night more than the rate I had booked at. Another trip to reception sorted this out. On neither occasion did the members of staff on duty apologise, in fact, they barely looked up at me!We are going back to NYC this December for a week, but this time I have booked the Sofitel, but wouldn't have had a problem with going back to the Renaissance again as it was a comfortable and convenient hotel."
147,1898,"Oct 16 2007 	Great Hotel	Just returned from a 4 day visit with two pre-teen grandaughters and we had a very nice stay at the Renaissance. I was a little concerned after reading some previous reviews but we were more than satisfied with the choice. The ONLY inconvenience was having to go up an elevator to the 3rd floor, which is their temporary lobby, and then having to take another elevator up to the room. I'm sure this will not be an issue when all the renovations are complete which should be soon. On the plus side of this, the security people on the ground level ask to see your room keys before allowing you to go up to the lobby. The rooms were very spacious and the beds VERY comfortable. The bathroom was large and very attractive with &quot;mother of pearl&quot; tiles on the wall. The &quot;Lather&quot; amenities were nice. You can't ask for a better location in Times Square. The staff was very cordial and accomodating. We did not eat in their restaurant but there are scads of restaurants all around plus a market across the street &quot;Smilers&quot; I think that carried any kind of food that you could imagine. We used the smoothie shop adjacent to the hotel for yummy treats!"
148,1898,"Oct 12 2007 	Great time	My wife and I booked a stay in the hotel for a weekend trip to Manhattan. It was our first time there and we had a great time! The hotel has an excellent location on Times Square; it is centrally located and is very close to Central Park, subway stations, Broadway theatres, etc... It was undergoing rennovations while we stayed there, but it did not inconveince us. The staff was very nice and accomodating. While we were in the city we ate at a restaurant called SWIZZ, on 310 West 53rd Street, between 8th and 9th Ave. It is Swiss food, and very good at that. Oh, one other thing we learned is that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural History has &quot;suggested&quot; entrance ticket fees, but do accept donations. A regular ticket may cost $18 for an adult, but you can donate as little as you want to enter. My wife and I only had a couple hours to see the MET, so we donated $5 each, rather than pay full price since we were not going to be there all day."
149,1898,"Oct 11 2007 	Could have chose another	I usually stay at Marriott Hotels on business. I decided to stay at the Renaissance becasue of the location. The hotel is currently going under renovations. Becasue of this, there is only one way into the hotel(through baggage). I could live with that if it wasn't for the poor service my wife and receved everyday we were at the hotel. At the one and only restaurant for breakfast, we never received service. Though we wanted to order off menu, we had to use the buffet and get our own drinks. The only time we saw the wait staff was to bring us the bill. Maybe the hotel will be at a better status when the construction is complete, but until then, I would personally stayed at another hotel."
150,1898,"Sep 24 2007 	Fantastic Location and staff	I have just returned from my honeymoon after staying at the Renaissance Hotel Times Square, and yes there is major renovations going on at the minute but I have to say that, that did not ruin our honeymoon one little bit. We did hear the odd 'bang' and drill going once in a while but to be honest that was when we returned to the hotel to drop off all the shopping bags we had gathered during the day. The location of this hotel is 5 star and you couldn't ask for anything better, with all the city noise going on 24 hours a day, you can not hear it with their sound proof windows. The staff were top class and Omar the conceirge is fantastic he definately knows his New York without a doubt and how to get here there and everywhere and if you need tickets etc you MUST go see him.All I can say is yes the renovations can make you think 'oh my what have i booked' when you arrive but trust me when i say that, that should not put you off from staying at the Renaissance Hotel Times Square, I am already booking my next trip for March and I am certainly staying at the Renaissance, I cant wait to see what there do with this hotel I was told that it will be complete by December.Top Class Stay!!!!!!!"
151,1898,Sep 11 2007 	Right in the heart of Times Square	Excellent hotel right in the centre of Times Square staff very help full. 26 floors the room was great had every thing we needed also has a in room safe and tea and coffee&quot; Free&quot;.The hotel is clean and tidy as are the rooms.The renaissance is under going work at the moment to upgrade rooms we stayed for five nights and had no problems or heard any buliding work.We would stay here again.
152,1898,"Sep 10 2007 	Very disappointed	Having stayed at the Renaissance several years ago, I was very excited to return. However, that excitement was short-lived once we arrived.I did receive a letter regarding current renovations, but not until shortly before the trip, and long after I had prepaid for the room.I was assured several times that the construction would not start before 9 a.m. So I was rather unhappy to be woken up at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning by hammering. The woman in the room next door poked her head out of her door at the same time I did. She was irate, to say the least. She said her stay had been miserable because of the construction.I called at least three times during the next 45 minutes because the hammering would stop shortly after I called the front desk, and would start up again a few minutes later.The water also was turned off when I checked in, so I had to cancel my plans to go for a run and then have a shower.Things improved on Sunday and Monday. The water was not turned off, and I was not woken up by construction.Elevators were an issue, as everyone in the hotel was funneled into only one elevator between the lobby floor and the street level. There often was a long line for that elevator.The room itself was large by New York City standards, and the beds were very comfortable. A good shower, but the lack of a fan in the bathroom left it smelling vaguely musty. The TV, which appeared to be circa 1983, did not work properly. Using the iron and hair dryer at the same time shorted the electricity for half of the room. The outlets provided on the desk tripped about every 2 minutes, so using those was impossible."
153,1898,"Sep 9 2007	Very nice stay.	The Renaissance is under construction, but we had a very nice stay. We had a renovated room, it was beautiful, bed was awesome. Staff was helpful and pleasant. My only complaint was that we had to go to the lobby or bar to use the wifi. There was a $17 per day charge to have (corded) internet access in our room."
154,1898,"Sep 9 2007 	disappointed due to construction	We had stayed at the Renaissance before 2 years ago, and thought it was the best location and hotel at Times Square. With high expectations, we assumed that nothing would have changed.Were we wrong!!! Currently, there is renovating going on at the hotel,which should be completed by October. There is a narrow entrance in entering the lobby before riding up the elevator to the main lobby area. There was blaring music that was not appropriate when we entered the building. We are Marriott Reward members, and had requested a refrigerator, extra pillows, toiletries, and a high level floor. It took 5 hours for us to receive our room!! The room did not have the items we requested by concierge email, so we had to request again with the front desk. There was not an area to wait for our room,due to the lack of seating and the other people also waiting for their room. So, we went to the Westin,which we stayed at last year, and waited in their large waiting area.The room was nice when we got there, but it was not very homey. It looked like a businessman's rooms. There was no flat screen tv, no free bottle water ( the Westin offers), and it was noisy due to the construction. The ice machine area on each floor is supposed to have vending machines, but none were visible.The fitness room used to have a basket of fruit for those that workout, but this amenity was no longer available. The treadmills were old and needed updating. The buttons on one of the elevators did not light up to indicate which floor you selected.You would have to hope that after pushing the button, that the elevator would take you to your floor.We still love the location and the hotel will probably look nice after the renovation, but for those that have to endure the process- we should have notified at reservation of the construction-the management should have reduced the rate or reduced the points needed to stay due to construction.-where are the apples at the front desk?? all the other Renaissance hotels still make it available for it's guests"
155,1898,"Aug 31 2007 	Disappointing...	Marriott Renaissance is in a great spot - the heart of Times Square... but we were SO disappointed ... the hotel had told us ahead of time that they are undergoing &quot;beautification&quot; - translation - &quot;lots of construction noise&quot;! Since we were visiting for our Anniversary, I called the hotel in advance to make sure that we would be placed on a floor away from the construction noise... they assured us that it would be &quot;no problem&quot;..... just to paint the picture, our room was a)directly under the construction, b)outside the air-conditioning condensers, and c) next to the elevator!!!!! When I expressed my disappointment, I was assured that we would get extra Marriott Rewards Points!!! We had made the decision to stay at the hotel, understanding that there would be some inconveniences.... BUT, at $419/night, we didn't expect to be woken at 8:45 by saws and hammers... I'm sure it will be great once complete, but in the mean time, consider staying somewhere else....."
156,1898,"Aug 31 2007 	The staff is what made the difference!	This was my first stay at the Renaissance in Times Square, and I have to say, our stay was exceptional. Like many other reviewers have stated, the location is superb, right in the heart of Times Square. I knew when I booked the hotel in June that it was being remodeled, and had been monitoring reviews. I also received a letter in the mail before our stay advising us of the renovations.When you first walk in, it seems less than impressive, as the entrance is under construction and you take an elevator to the reception area. The lobby is nothing special ... but I am sure it will look much nicer come October when everything is complete.I had called the night before to request a newly renovated room, and they complied with our request. The new carpet in the hallway was busy and obnoxious ... not necessarily my taste ... but I guess it won't show the wear as much. The room was very nice, and the bed was heavenly.The best part of our stay, however, was the staff, in particular Cathy and Mario. They were so friendly and helpful, it truly made our trip special. They even went so far as to have a complimentary bottle of champagne and strawberries sent to our room. It is details like this that make the hotel stand out from the rest.We weren't bothered what-so-ever by the renovations, on Saturday morning we could hear them starting around 10 am but it was not too loud or bothersome.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and we will definitely return to the Renaissance on our next trip to NYC."
157,1898,"Aug 21 2007 	Great location will be great hotel	this hotel is great for its location, literally in the middle of Times Square, you walk out of the hotel and you are in the thick of all that is happening and also very close to Rockefeller Center, Central Park. etc. Its only downside at the moment is that it is going through what the hotel call a beautification, so on arrival yes the lobby is bad, well non existent really, the check in area is not good, and there are hoardings around hiding the building work. However I was sent a letter from the hotel before I arrived telling me about this, I also knew from reading Tripadvisor and had emailed hotel to ask them about disruption to hotel during work. Therefore I cannot complain about hotel as others before me have, I was aware and still booked. When renovations are complete this hotel will be great. When we checked in I was given an old room, within about 10 mins of checking in front desk rang to ask if everything was ok, I asked to be moved to a refurbished room, they couldn't do it for first night but promised me for 2nd. On 2nd day we were out sightseeing all day and came back to find we had new room and all luggage had already been moved. Ask for a refurbished room, they are brighter and more modern and just seem cleaner. Breakfast was standard but view over Times Square priceless, staff all very attentive and helpful.Overall a great hotel for sightseeing in the Big Apple"
158,1898,"Aug 20 2007 	Good Hotel	Hotel is under renovation, so the lobby is tight. The room was nice but small, which is probably the NYC norm. We had a package that included breakfast. Food and service at the restaurant was excellent, and the view is great. Other hotel staff were good. They parked my new Suburban for 3 days without incident, although it cost $64 per day. The location of the hotel could not be better if you want to be in the heart of Times Square within walking distance of Broadway, Rock. Center, 5th Ave. shopping, etc. We hopped on the subway near the hotel for a Yankees game and the next day for sightseeing in lower Manhattan. It was a pricey stay, but overall it was worth the money. When renovations are complete I'm sure the experience will be even better."
159,1898,"Aug 15 2007 	Top location comfortable bed!!!	This was our second visit to NYC, and having previously stayed at the Hotel Pensylvannia (not the best) we decided to 'upgrade' ourselves for a bit of luxury following our wedding and head for the Renaissance in Times Square.The location could not be beat, the staff seemed helpful, however we were out more than in. The breakfast was fantastic as were the rooms (good size for NYC) and the bed was just fantastic...the most comfortable I have ever slept in.The only downside I would say is that yes you can get a fab view of Times Square, however, make sure that you ask for a room, maybe around floor 3-6 as if you are much higher you don't actually get to see much of the goings on in the outside world as you are too high up and all you get to see is other tower blocks and maybe a bill board or two!! (cannot complain though as prior to my arrival I asked for a high room thinking that the view would probably be the best, we stayed on the 15th floor).I do see some reviews slating this hotel, however, can honestly say that if people find it not to their taste then they are probably very hard to please.Overall would recommend this hotel and would definately stay again due to location of the hotel and comfort of the rooms."
160,1898,"Aug 12 2007 	No problems with the Renaissance	My daughter, daughter in law and I just returned from a wonderful 4 day stay at the Renaissance Hotel in nyc. Everyone was helpful and made our stay very pleasant. Our room had a king bed and we asked for a rollaway. The rollaway was twin size, did not &quot;roll up&quot; and slid out of the way nicely. We were not even aware of noises from renovations--in fact did not see any sign of them except for the lobby and anybody should be able to put up with a minor inconvenience! We would return in a heart beat!"
161,1898,"Aug 7 2007 	A Nightmare	This is a terrible hotel. Let's begin with the lobby. Oh, wait. There isn't one. You enter from 7th Avenue into a dank box with two rickety elevators that take you to the third floor, where you find... another dank box. This one has a tiny bar and several temporary desks. A video projector blind you as you exit the elevator, projecting meaningless sperm-like squiggles in a possible attempt to distract you from the disgusting space. Following a twisting passageway, you arrive at three elevators. Two and a half, actually, as one of them was used primarily to trap guests throughout our stay - to the point that hotel employees - ever helpful - joked about it. Once you arrive in your room, the space is actually fairly nice, if somewhat dirty. As I type this I literally cannot converse with others in my room, because of the 'minor' construction noise that begins on the floor above at 7am every day. The location is great, right in the middle of Times Square. But don't expect a view - the side of the hotel that would have one is blocked by that giant Coca Cola sign. There is a view of one thing, though - the four other hotels you should have stayed at: the Sheraton, the W, the Westin and the Marriott Marquis."
162,1898,"Aug 6 2007	SUPER--In the Heart of Town	Very nice Hotel, amazingly close to Everything in and around Times Square!!!!!Yes, renovations are going on, but we were up and out of our room and they did not bother us. If you are going to be in your room from 8am to 5pm, you may experience some noise, but after this location is remodeled, it will even be better than it is now.We did not have a remodeled room but it was still nice. The view from the room was wonderful, we were on the 9th floor, and you could hear a little bit of street noise but not much. Just request a higher floor if you do not want to hear the street.Our two queen beds were very comfortable with down comforter and soft sheets, and nice pillows. Lighting in the room was plentiful. A nice size closet, to hang your clothing. TV good and a variety of channels. Bathroom had good lighting and nice size tub/shower. The room also has a small refrigerator, with items for a CHARGE. Coffee maker with coffee for free.The A/C was very quite and efficient.I would recommend this property and would stay here again. Especially after the remodel. I will be excited to see the finished product."
163,1898,"Aug 2 2007 	renovations going on but this was nice!	we stayed here on 7/29 - 7/31, and enjoyed a renovated room on the 24th floor. the room was supposed to be a smaller room as it was in the end of the hall but compared to previous ny hotels we have visited, this room was spacious! the decor was modern, but even if the carpets were new, we wonder why they chose such a bold design for the hallways, and a garish color for the interiors of the rooms. the bathroom was nicely done too with extra towels. the king bed was very comfortable, so were the pillows. in the morning, we did hear renovations going on, but not a major inconvenience as it was after 8. a minor inconvenience was having to go to the 14th floor for ice, but we just had to do it once. the location was great, the enitre staff was accomodating and courteous. we would definitely come back if given a chance."
164,1898,Jul 18 2007	Awful	Terrible - I had an awful experience at this hotel. The staff was clueless about what was going on and were not courteous enough of to take care of the smallest issues. There was noise in the hotel at all times - especially with the construction going on. I will not stay here again.
165,1898,"Jul 12 2007 	Great Location	I stayed at this property using my Marriott Points.Room:We had a room with 1 king bed that was at the end of the hallway. It was a bit smaller than the typical hotel room at Renaissance Hotels, not sure if it is because we had the end room, or all the rooms at this property were small. Other than size, the room was very clean, had everything we need, and provided everything we expected from a hotel room.Service:The staff at this hotel were excellent at every level. Although we arrived very early, the front desk was very courteous and helped us check in early with no charges.Location:The location of this hotel cannot be beat! We had no idea that this was literally one of the buildings in the middle of times square and had a little trouble finding it when we first arrived. We were absolutely right in the middle of everything! We walked around times square, saw a show on broadway, and took the subway all around Manhattan."
166,1898,"Jun 23 2007 	Renovations were going on while we were there June 8-11	This was my second stay at the Renaissance and there is indeed work going on. However, the work goes on between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm so it really wasn't a bother because we were out of the room most of the time. The staff were courteous and helpful and even allowed us to check into our room around 11:00 am. I was a little disappointed that we couldn't eat breakfast in the usual restaurant where we could look out over Times Square as we ate, but they are in the process of remodeliing that as well. Temporarily, the dining room is where the lounge was previously located on the opposite side of the building.Even with construction going on, we had a wonderful stay at the Renaissance and would definitely go back. You can't beat it for location and the beds are wonderful! I also love the large bathrooms and the marble vanity tops with enough space for the three of us to put all of our stuff."
167,1898,"Jun 21 2007 	Nice Stay... will be much nicer soon	The hotel is under renovation. The room I was in, was not renovated, but it was nice. It had an 80s Dynasty feel to the room. It was not ugly its just not contemporary or stylish. The bed was VERY comfortable. I have stayed in the Times Square area many times in my life and never have I had such a quiet room. It was really amazing. I was shocked at how quiet it was in the room. I heard a few noises, the steel drums in times square, but it was not loud or bothersome at all. There is a small fitness center that is really outdated. I hope the gym is included in the renovations. Central Park is only a few blocks away... perfect for a morning run. I would stay here again."
168,1898,"Jun 20 2007 	Under renovation needs it badly don't count on Marriott Rewards benefits	Like a prior reviewer, I am Marriott Platinum Elite, which makes one eligible for a room upgrade, access to the concierge floor or to breakfast, a welcome gift, and a Marriott Rewards points bonus. The latter showed up, but none of the other benefits were given to me, the hotel hasn't responded to my inquiry about this at checkout, and Marriott Rewards corporate basically says &quot;tough&quot;. Over and above that disappointment (what good is being in the highest rewards level where special service is to ensue), the hotel is currently under renovation, which it sorely needs. The rooms are average at best for this level of hotel and daily room rate. The carpets, furnishings, wall coverings, etc., were pretty worn and badly in need of upgrading. The lobbies are incredibly small for such a large hotel, there are few onsite extra amenities and meeting rooms, parking is offsite and not immediately accessible, service is OK but staffing is slim, and the single restaurant is small, undistinguished, and competes with numerous restaurants in the area that are better and half the price. I was extremely disappointed, won't return. There are numerous superior hotels in the immediate area, particularly the Marriott Marquis (outstanding and far better than this alleged 4-diamond property), the Westin, the Marriott Courtyard (a lesser luxury property, but better), etc. Also, don't count on anything if you participate in Marriott Rewards."
169,1898,"Jun 7 2007 	Fabulous City	I stayed at the Renaissance last December and thoroughly enjoyed it. Room was clean, spacious and the beds were amazing! I wanted to take the bed home on the plane with me!! We paid for room only (not many NY hotels do B&amp;B or if they do they charge like wounded rhino) so we ate out which was cheaper. The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful and answered questions with a smile. Main reception is on first floor via a ground floor lobby - please check if you are staying at this hotel in 2007 though as I think they may be renovating it at some stage - although please check this with the hotel. It is slap bang in the middle of Times Square one of the best locations in New York - we were quite high up and had amazing views of the street and flashing billboards - we had no problem with noise as double glazing was very good and also being high up helped. Lifts were prompt - no waiting around for ages and in the stair well they have an ice machine which I think should be mandatory in British Hotels! its so handy to have an ice machine to keep your wine cool ;o) have a wonderful stay anyone who is staying here - I found it a wonderful hotel and as for New York well it speaks for itself! Loved it."
170,1898,"May 18 2007 	Best location great hotel	Rooms big for New York, clean and tidy. The bed was simply wonderful as reported by others on this site (wondered what the fuss was about) - I now understand! The location is the best in Manhattan, in particular for first time tourist. It's located in Times Square, tourist info office is opposite. Shops, all theatres, subway and tour buses within 200 metres of hotel. The downtown, uptown and night tour buses are across the road. The staff were freindly, especially the concierge who could not do enough for you. The best feature of the hotel has to be the view of Times Square from the restaurant in the evening or at breakfast. It's on the third floor, reception level and is a site to behold. All in all, this is a class hotel. One word of caution, they are renovating the hotel this year."
171,1898,"Apr 28 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	We arrived at the hotel on Friday 13th April. The check in was quick and efficient and we were shown to our room on the 21st floor. The first thing that we noticed was the sound.... considering the location it was peaceful. The room was large, well equipped and spotlessly clean. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, which we have often found lacking in most NY hotels. The bathroom too was a very good size with plenty of towels and toiletries. I noticed that the hairdryer was missing, but after a call to housekeeping, it was delivered 10 minutes later.Unfortunately the weather in NY was absolutely atrocious for the ten days we were there, but the staff always had a smile on their faces and made us feel we were &quot;coming home&quot; after a day out. We only ate once in the hotel, and that was for breakfast. It was bbuffet style. There was a very good choice and for a hotel, very good value. The location of this hotel is superb. No more than 2 minutes from the subway and of course theatres and shops. We travel to New York three or four times a year as our daughter lives there and we would have absolutely no hesitation in booking this hotel again."
172,1898,"Apr 27 2007 	Great Location	This was our first time in New York, &amp; we decided on this hotel due to its central location &amp; we weren't disappointed.We spent 4 nights here over Easter, the room was a reasonable size &amp; the double beds were just so comfortable - the best we've ever slept on - that it was a joy to get back to our room after a hectic day sightseeing.Our room was on the 15th floor &amp; the outside noise didn't bother us at all.All the staff were courteous &amp; helpful, the concierge recommended &amp; booked us a restaurant on our first night, It was reasonably priced &amp; a lovely way to start our holiday.Its a good idea if you are doing a show or if you want to eat by 9pm to reserve a table at a restaurant, as they all get very busy.The subway is literally a few steps from the hotel entrance &amp; a very cheap &amp; quick way to get around the city - $24 for a weeks unlimited travel on subway &amp; bus.If you want to have cold drinks in your room ask for a refrigerator on checking in, as if you move anything in the minibar it automatically gets charged.We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel on our next visit to NYC."
173,1898,"Apr 20 2007 	problems galore will never go back	Let me start by saying we have previously stayed at this hotel several times in 2006 and had wonderful service and great accommodations, which is why we chose this hotel for spring break 2007.... However we just returned from a 9 day stay over Easter. We are Platinum Elite members and were put in a shabby room next to the supply/service area where we were awakened every morning at 8 am with banging and chatter (and yes I did ask them to stop) that sounded as if it were in our room (they finally offered to move us... 7 days into our trip). Took several calls and a trip to desk to get rollaway that was supposed to be sent up 'right away' and then I had to make it (at 11:30 pm). Had several maitenance issues (that involved guest safety and required 2 phone calls) and frankly maitenance guy wasn't very inclined to fix it until I pointed out what would happen if one of us got hurt, desk never called to see if they were resolved. Room service order timely... but wrong. Breakfast buffet sparce and service terrible (20 minutes to get coffee...I was on my way to get it myself when he finally brought it over). The last sraw was when we returned from a show at 11:30 pm to find our room had not been cleaned (despite a call and trip to the desk before we left).We spoke with Asst general manager the next day, he was not very helpful. I did discover that management has changed in the past few months and its obvious it has not been for the better. I will say the Concierge Staff is top notch, but that is not enough to hazard a stay at this hotel. Also, they are not that busy as several floors are already closed off due to upcoming renovations set to start May 1st. Best of luck to you if you stay here.We won't ever again.... not with the Westin a few blocks away!"
174,1898,"Apr 15 2007 	Fantastic wonderful staff	This hotel is in a fantastic location, right in the middle of times square. The views from the rooms and the restaurant are amazing. I stayed there with my mother and my younger sister on a sightseeing trip. I had been to New York several times before and this was by far and away the best hotel I have stayed in. The room was spacious with a large bathroom and an extremely comfortable bed.What really made this stay special was the staff. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and polite and made an effort to get to know you. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning and the waiters remembered what we ate the morning before. I would certainly recommend this hotel."
175,1898,"Apr 9 2007	Everything it promised and more	Service was great, the view was amazing and the concierge was the best I have encountered. This hotel is everything it is cracked up to be. There could be no better way to experience the theatre district in all it's grandeur."
176,1898,"Apr 8 2007 	Overpriced small rooms	My wife and I spent a weekend at this hotel as a romantic getaway. Though the hotel was OK, I would say overall it was disappointing, and I would not recommend it for that kind of stay. The room was very small, even though it was one of the more expensive rooms ($429 per night). For this price, I expect superluxury service, which this was not. The number of TV channels was disappointing. Also, there was no turn-down service. And there were tacky touches such as a breakfast menu left on the bed. I didn't like having to take two elevators to get to our room. On the plus side, the location was great if you like Times Square, as I do."
177,1898,"Apr 5 2007 	Family Friendly Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my two kids (12 &amp; 13) during the Easter holiday. The hotel was pricey ($379/night) and I was feeling a bit cheated until I met the front desk staff. Their friendly smiles, helpful attitudes, and the special M&amp;Ms gift that they left for us in our room made the difference. I can honestly say that I did not hear my neighbors nor the street noise so the hotel is sound proof - this I loved! If you decide to visit Times Sqaure you must splurge on the the Gray-Line bus tour's All Loops package. We practically experienced everything that NYC has to offer tourists. Over a 3 day period using the Gray-Line hop-on/hop-off service (included in the All Loops package) we were able to dine in Harlem for a soul food dinner at Sylvia's, ate breakfast in Little Italy, shopped in SoHo, visited the WTC site, shopped at Century 21 department store, toured the MET, spotted celebrities, ate LOTS of sweets at Dylan's Candy Bar, toured Wall Street, etc., all by using the Gray-Line tours. Don't buy the tour package from the street vendors! Call their 1-800 # and pick the tickets up to save 10%. The ticket office is very close to this hotel. Thanks to Gray-Line, this hotel, and a great pair of walking shoes, this was the BEST vacation ever! The kids loved it and so did I - worth every penny!"
178,1898,"Apr 2 2007 	Great Place to Stay in the Heart of Times Square	We headed over to the Renaissance Hotel after a dreadful night at another hotel around the block. As soon as we walked into our room, we knew we had made the right choice to shell out a bit more cash for a highly rated hotel in the same area. The room was spacious, the view of Times Square was great, the staff were helpful, and most importantly, the bed was super comfortable! This is a very nice hotel and we highly recommend it if you are staying in Times Square."
179,1898,"Apr 2 2007 	A very nice hotel	We stayed here for three nights around the end of March.The style is a mixture of contemporary and art deco and manages to convey a feeling of understated class with a relaxed atmosphere.We stayed on the fifteenth floor and had a view out onto 7th Avenue. Plenty of hustle and bustle going on outside 24/7 but we were never disturbed by this as the soundproofing is excellent.The staff were very friendly and our maid even left us a thankyou note for the tip we left her each day.The location is excellent for the Broadway theatres along with plenty of restaurants and shops. The Olive Garden is right underneath the hotel (hotel starts on 2nd floor) and there is a great juice bar called Jambas next door.Also handy is the main stop for the Gray Line open top bus tours (just across the street). We found this very handy for seeing pretty much the whole of Manhattan in a short period. The subway station is also next door.The Rockefeller Center is a couple of blocks away, so is easily walkable. The Top of the Rock is a must-do visit.All-in-all we found our stay very enjoyable with the hotel providing a comfortable and friendly stay with a touch of class in a great central location."
180,1898,"Mar 23 2007	Nice Stay	This property was centrally located in Times Square and the rooms were nice. The beds were very comfortable. They hotel also carried the LATHER products, which smell great. I was a little disappointed as this hotel is advertised to be a 4 star. It is not. This is your typical 3 star hotel with nice amenities and nicer rooms. This is a smaller hotel and the staff was not as attentive as you would expect for a hotel of this size. The location was nice but when you are in NY, you really dont spend that much time in Times Square. Overall, the hotel was nice, clean, and in a good location. I would recommend it for visitors."
181,1898,"Mar 11 2007 	Great location. Very helpful staff.	My Mum, sister and I stayed here at the beginning of March. I'm very fussy about were I stay and we weren't disappointed by the Renaissance. It's right in the middle of Times Square (just behind the big Coca-Cola sign) but don't let that put you off because it's so quiet.The concierge staff were extremely helpful and all of the staff courteous and friendly. The rooms were really clean and the bathrooms were big and airy. The only thing I would say is that the hotel is going to be refurbished starting March and ending sometime in August. The plans were on show in the foyer of the hotel and it's going to be quite modern - quite a difference from what it's like now. All the rooms will have flat screen tv's, new beds etc so I'm sure it's going to be nice.If you want to stay in a hotel that's right in the middle of things then this is it. The breakfast is great and the location is excellent. We will definitely be back."
182,1898,"Mar 7 2007	Great Hotel	This hotel was in a great location for all of the activities we had planned. The subway stop is close and we were within walking distance of our Broadway play and the Rockefeller Center. The concierge was great. Omar was there through the week and he gave us wonderful suggestions. The weekend staff was also great and gave us good information about weekend construction on the subway and which cars to get on to get to the south ferry exit. Checkin was fun with Eric waiting on us, he had a wonderful attitude and sense of humor. The room was bigger than we expected for New York and quieter than we expected. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very clean. All in all it was a great experience and we can't wait to go back."
183,1898,Mar 2 2007 	Decent stay	Plus- Location is the best. Hotel is close to everything.- Room is surprisingly quiet given how busy the location is.- Complimentary buffet per my Marriott Platinum status was excellent with unbelievable view!Minus- Our room is very dated. Wear and tear are everywhere.- Bellboys and all guys downstair were helpless. I had about 5 bags checked in before my ride came and picked me up. No one downstair offered me any help (not even catching the door) and I had to make multiple trips coming in and out the door with all guys just looking at me. It was horrible.- We had to ride two elevators to get to our room. Just found that inconvenient.- Front desk promised to bring us a fridge... it never came.
184,1898,"Feb 27 2007	Comfortable bed was the star attraction	The room was not a big as I would have expected but was fine. The bed was the star attraction, one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We had requested a high floor and therefore had no noise distractions for an excellent nights sleep.As the hotel has an ecellent location we were able to walk everywhere around mid-town manhattan. A good nights sleep was much appreciated.I was disapointed with the quality of the towels in the restroom. They were old and shabby and I expected better for this quality of hotel. Perhaps I was misled by a website review that stated the restrooms had &quot;Body Shop&quot; bath products. They were NOT body shop and not high quality by any means. The bar maid in the hotel bar was not very friendly. The concierge were excellent. Omar's recommendations made my holiday special. Check-in and check-out was fast and without any hassle.Overall I felt the hotel was quite nice with a good location but for the price paid, the little extras can make the difference and these were lacking. I will try some other hotel next time in New York."
185,1898,"Feb 26 2007 	Great location at Times Square	We stayed at the Renaissance Times Square for 1 night in Feb.'07. Everything at the hotel is great from front desk to wait staff at their restaurant Foley's. Location--absolutely the best ! The hotel is right at Times Square. Tons of restaurants are within walking distance, as well as the theatres for shows. We took a taxi to get to Little Italy/Chinatown in downtown, total taxi fare is $12 incl. tips. Also we walked 10 blocks up to FAO Swartz toy store and got some really good toys there that weren't found in other places. On the way back to the Renaissance from FAO Swartz, we stopped at the huge Catholic church (sorry forgot the name already). The hotel is only 2 blocks to the Rock. center and NBC studios. We walked there a couple times and had a good time there.Food--we went to Foley's for breakfast. The whole restaurant has got a full view of the Times Square so it doesn't matter where your table is. Breakfast is buffet style, our server Samuel is great. Coffee is delicious there as well as the fresh orange juice. Food is good in quality, we loved the smoked salmon, hash brown with sun-dried tomatoes, lean bacon, sausage, as well as plenty of fresh fruits such as strawberries, watermelon......very yummy and healthy start of a day. Price is around $23/pp, half price for kids.The hotel itself is great in general. Small lobby but who wants to sit in the lobby when you're at Times Square?! Our room is very clean, quiet, with marble bathroom. We got a nice sized room with 2 double beds, a sofa chair, an executive desk, tv.....very nice size based on our previous stays at other hotels in NYC. I would definitely stay here again."
186,1898,"Feb 19 2007 	Loved this hotel	The hotel is in a great location - within walking distance to Broadway shows, Subway exits and Grayline tour. The rooms were very nice and surprisingly, no sound from Times Square could be heard inside. I would definitely stay here again."
187,1898,"Feb 18 2007 	Perfect in Every Way	We stayed 4 nights with our daughters, aged 14-23, and had a fantastic stay. All 3 rooms were in perfect condition, scrupulously clean, well appointed on both sides of the building. The staff were superb - efficient and very pleasant indeed, nothing was too much trouble. Try Lindy's Diner for a real taste of what the average English person expects an American diner to be! Also, try Alice's Tea Cup on the edge of Central Park for a more English tea than England can manage - the choice of teas alone is endless!We were unfortunate enough to be in NY when the storms began and the Concierge and Guest Services staff were fantastic in finding out about the current position on flights etc. Beware Delta Air Lines - in a crisis, they're absolutely diabolical. We all spent the night on the floor at the airport after many promises that could never have been fulfilled, and continual episodes of their being &quot;economical with the truth&quot;! Thank you Renaissance - you made it all worthwhile!!! Would love to return some day."
188,1898,"Feb 15 2007 	Nice hotel	Although the location of this hotel leaves a little to be desired, it turned out to be fine. The set up is strange, you go into a small lobby, and then are instructed to take an elevator up one floor to the real lobby. It is small, not very charming, and the concierge desk was not often manned. If you are staying in the Times Square area, be warned, its very noisy. I would recommend that you stay closer to Rockefeller Center. Its much quieter. That being said, our room itself wasnt bad. The bed was wonderful, the bathroom was good sized and there was a coffee maker, and mini bar in the room. My only complaint about the room was that it didnt feel real clean, it felt dusty and a little worn, but after our bad experience at the Grand Hyattit seemed pretty good. Dont expect any extras though, unless you ask, they werent real big on customer service. I think its a NYC thing."
189,1898,"Feb 15 2007 	Best location and great service!	I was a little nervous about staying in Times Square and how clean the hotel would really be. I needn't have worried, everything was spotless. The service was excellent, the staff was extremely helpful.The location is only a few blocks from Rockefeller Center and right in Times Square and if you like to people watch, head to the bar beside the restaurant and you can watch all the people on the street and enjoy an uninterrupted view of Times Square. I would definitely stay here again."
190,1898,"Feb 11 2007	Fabulous Time!	Stayed in the Renaissance for four nights from Feb 4th and had a wonderful time! The location is superb, we could see Times Square in all it's glory right outside our window! The staff were very polite and helpful. Our room on the 21st floor was excellent, large and well appointed, with a huge comfy bed (and plenty of pillows!) and a lovely clean bathroom. Due to the large number of restaurants right on our doorstep, we didn't eat at Foley's, the hotel's restaurant, but the smells coming from it every night were delicious!What surprised me the most was the soundproofing! I have been to New York once before, and at night it was possible to hear all the traffic noise and sirens through the windows (I stayed in a different hotel). However, this time when we closed the window, we could hear nothing! That combined with the bed made for a good night's sleep after a busy day.We also felt extremely safe in the Renaissance - as two 18-year-olds on our own, it was a comfort to have somewhere friendly to return to if we had any problems, or needed any advice.All in all, this made for a brilliant trip, and I would recommend this hotel to anybody!"
191,1898,"Feb 11 2007 	Lovley night in the City excellent location	Other than the difficulty discerning where to valet park, we had a great night on the town here. The lobby can be a bit disjointed and we were dissappointed that the bar did not open until later in the evening but our room and service was excellent.The bathrooms were large, very clean, plenty of marble and the toiletries were plentiful and fragrant.The best part of this hotel is the excellent location right in Times Square. Very fun and busy. We had room service for breakfast. I had Eggs Benedict and my husband had pancakes and then we split their signature dish, the lemon soufle pancake. Except for the over tart lemon pancakes everything else was excellent.Watch your valet ticket, we were charged an extra night because we were an hour over the 24 hour limit."
192,1898,Feb 7 2007 	Location Location	We spent my wife's 40th B-Day at this hotel and was very satisfied!! Hotel room was very clean and quiet. The coolest part was the table we sat at for dinner (Foley's Fish house) was were they sit on New Years to drop the ball. So you could only imagine the view. The food was good but nothing special. The view and service made up for it. I would suggest flying into LGA and not Newark (NJ) because it will cost you an arm and leg for Taxi fare back to the airport. Only $35 plus tolls from LGA.
193,1898,"Feb 6 2007 	Fantastic... Absolutely Fantastic	We have just returned from a 5 day break in New York and we stopped at the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square. The hotel is magnificent and situated in the best possible area. The service from the staff was incredible. Omar and Greg are a credit to the Hotel. If youre new to New York like we were Omar in the Concierge area provided great help in supplying information on how to get about, what to see, where to go, booking tables in Restaurants etc etc etc. Greg on the front desk provided help to any issues you experienced. (Our only issue was finding the best take-a-way Pizza... Greg sorted it). This hotel is best placed for all your requirements. If you are considering this hotel you'll regret not booking it due to its location. The Room is tidy with a huge bed. We have stopped at some great hotels in the past but this bed by far was the most comfortable. After long periods of walking, shopping and dining taking a shower or a bath and relaxing in that bed was ideal. A great start to the next day. We didnt eat in the hotel restaurant which was unfortunate on our part as the view of Times Square is breathtaking. I here refurbishments are taking place in March 2007 to allow customers to see the view on arrival into the hotel. Overall, this hotel is a must. We will be stopping again."
194,1898,"Feb 5 2007 	Best place for all of the action!!!!!!!!	Just stayed at the RENAISSANCE TIMES SQUARE this past Saturday night, excellent all around:LOCATION: you can't ask for better, steps away from all the theratres, restaurants and Times square.STAFF: excellent from the valet, doorman, front desk, in particular Greg at the front desk who arrainged for champagne and chocolate covered strawberries at no cost to us b/c it was our anniversary.ROOM: stayed on the 11th floor was a little concerned about street noise, not a sound all night. Requested a king bed, and got a king bed. Room was nicely decorated, bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.Overall I had a difficult time finding fualt with this hotel and are amazed at the bad reviews that I have seen posted before. We haved stayed at some of the best hotels and these guys are doing something right."
195,1898,"Feb 4 2007 	A Wonderful Experience!	We just returned from a week long stay at the Renaissance Times Square and enjoyed every minute. The room was spacious and very clean, as was the bathroom. My wife loved the deep tub and enjoyed a relaxing bath every night. Room service was delicious and affordable (try the breaded chicken and shrimp for a scrumtious late night snack). The service was impeccable. The view of Times Square from the bar &amp; resturaunt is all that it's hyped up to be. If you're looking to be right in the middle of Times Square, your wish will be granted. One step out the door of the hotel and your knee deep in the midst of it all. If we decide to stay in Times Square again we will not hesitate to stay at the Renaissance again. Enjoy!"
196,1898,"Jan 30 2007 	Great Location - Great Shopping	My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for four nights 18-22 January 2007. We spent hours choosing the hotel, and as usual read the reviews here on TripAdvisor before we decided. I sent an email in advance and asked for a nice room since it was my girlfriend's birthday, but thought no more of it. When we arrived (six hours delayed because of UK bad weather), Greg checked us in, wished my girlfriend happy birthday, and upgraded us to a 23rd floor Superior Room (2308). Good start!The room itself was fantastic. Hotel rooms in New York are usually pretty small, but this room was big (this might be because it was a superior room, of course). It had a very comfortable king-size bed with six pillows, writing desk and chair, glass table and another chair, cable TV, mini-safe and fridge with minibar. The room also had a hair drier, iron and ironing board, which all came in handy. The bathroom was big as well with a bath-and-shower combo. After visiting some friends in the Quality Inn 100 meters away, we realised how lucky we were with our room.We were worried about street noise, but it was not a problem this high up in the building. There are no windows in the hotel facing Times Square itself (except from the restaurant), they are either facing 7th Avenue or Broadway. The view is nice, and you can still see Times Square from the window. The windows can be opened for ventilation, but cannot be open fully. Unlike some other reviews, our room was spotless and clean at all times.Note that the fridge in the room automatically charges you if you remove any items, or so it said. We accidentally removed the Voss water bottle, then read the instructions. Whoops. We put the bottle back, and wasn't actually charged for it in the end.There is room service, but it was pretty expensive (for us) so we actually never ate in the hotel. There are loads of delis and restaurants nearby, so there is plenty of choice when it comes to food.We only really dealt with Greg at the front desk, and he was always smiling and really helpful. Really nice guy! After midnight you have to show your room key to gain access to the building, and this policy made us feel safe when entering the hotel late at night.The location at 7 Avenue @ 47th street is amazing - actually ON Times Square. It is very near all the theatres, and you can easily walk down to Macy's, Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building (around 34st street); and up to Rockefeller Centre (50th) and onwards to Bloomindale's, Tiffany's etc (around 58th). If you have lots of your girlfriend's shopping to carry, yellow taxis are cheap and reliable :-).All in all a very nice stay in New York, in a very pleasant hotel in a great location.One small tip: If you have been to Empire State Building before, consider going to the top of Rockefeller Centre. The observation decks at around the 70th floor give you a great view of Downtown and Empire State Building, but also of Central Park and Upper East/West Side. If you do go, don't forget to find and play around in the sound-and-light room :-)."
197,1898,"Jan 29 2007 	Great Location.. clean... very satisfied	My fiance and I stayed one night at the Renaissance and were very satisfied with the hotel. It's location is perfect for visiting Times Square and the Theatre District and our room was very clean. The bar across from the lobby had a nice jazz trio playing and had a decent view of the action. There was that smell that other reviewers have mentioned; it's not a bad smell, just very potent. My only complaint would be the noise from the street at night. From reading the reviews here, I knew to request a room on a high floor which is supposed to be quieter. However, that room wasn't ready when we arrived (we arrived before check-in time), so we took a Queen room on the 7th floor instead. That may have been a mistake. The sirens and horns definitely bothered me during the night. I think if we had stayed on a higher floor, that might not have happened. Overall though, we had a great stay at the Renaissance and would stay here again."
198,1898,"Jan 13 2007 	A central location for a perfect NYC experience!	My husband, 2 adult sons, and I just returned from 2 nights at this perfectly located NYC gem. We were in the heart of Times Square, but resting in a quiet 21st floor respite. The rooms are large &amp; the bathrooms well appointed. The staff is friendly and attentive and the hotel is only steps from Broadway shows and fine dining options.We are from New Jersey, so we are not strangers to NYC and come into the city frequently for business &amp; pleasure. It's a treat to stay overnight &amp; the Renaissance did not disappoint. We did not eat in the hotel and highly recommend Lattanzi's and Azalea's (Theater district) and Crispo's (14th Street). For breakfast go up to Cafe Europa (57th St.). The Renaissance is close if you want to check out Good Morning America or The Today Show. They are fun to see and I can tell you the staff &amp; Hosts of GMA make you feel welcome and pose for photos!Don't miss NYC and The Renaissance for a great getaway weekend."
199,1898,"Jan 6 2007 	I Will Gladly Stay There Again.	I stayed there Jan. 2007 for a two night stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Times Square with easy access to everything. The check-in was perfect. They were extremely quick and polite. My room was well decorated and furnished. The bed was perfect with quality linens. My only complaint was the dirty floors and carpeting, which they corrected immediately. In summary, marbled bathroom with great plumbing, great bed, perfect location, and impeccable service. I will definitely stay there again."
200,1898,"Jan 5 2007 	Shaky start but good overall	I stayed here with my 3 teenage kids for the last few days of Dec. Room was paid for up front and very expensive (More than $600/night) We were promised early check-in since we had a very early flight that arrived before 8 am. Room was not ready when we arrived, but promised by noon. We were dissapointed that it was not ready at noon, told to come back at 2 pm, when we did, the room was still not available. The person at the front desk told us I could get hot chocolate for my kids at the resturant bar, but the bartender could not be bothered with us! (He actually told us it would be too much trouble) We were so tired and the lobby is tiny, but we sat there for another hour and a half before we were given access to our room. The room was nice enough, but not spacious. There were hairs in the tub and hairclips left on the bar area - not a big deal, but for $600 a night, the room should be spotless! After I complained, they did send housekeeping up to clean the tub and later they sent up a bottle of wine.On the positive side, the location of this hotel is incredible - right in the middle of everything. We saw several plays and went to Rockefeller Center, etc., and everything was just a short walk. On New Year's Eve, the staff took extra precautions to make sure only registered guests were entering the hotel and they also secured a small area right outside the hotel doors where you could comfortably watch the action. Our room was on a higher floor, so street noise was not much of a problem and the view was great. The bathroom was spacious and attractive. Linens on the bed were wonderful. The on site resturant has a great view of times square, but is pricey. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room tidy and well stocked with soap and towels. The conceige was kind and helpful, but the best part of this hotel was Amos the doorman, who cheered us up every time we ran into him.I would probably prefer to stay at the Marquis which has much bigger rooms, and a full service lobby, but would definately stay here again."
201,1898,"Dec 22 2006 	Excellent	Well, all i can say is unreal! This little beaut is all you could wish for in a hotel. Bang in the centre of everything. The most comfortable beds on earth, deepest bath tubs,apples and news papers on front desk,what more can one ask for? Not really much more i can say as its just spot on, but i would like to make a special comment on the Concierge desk.... WOW! Omah and the girls helped me no-end! Everything i wanted/needed it was done there and then! they dont come better than Omah and his team! HIGHLY RECOMEND this hotel. A++++++"
202,1898,"Nov 11 2006 	Great for Families	We have recently returned form a 5 night stay in NYC.As we were bringing our 7 year old daughter we wanted a hotel with a central location. The Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square was perfect.The staff were fantastic especially Omar!!!!Our room was on the 19th floor and was a good size as was the bathroom. The safe was also big enough to fit my laptop in which was added security.With the subway 30 seconds from the door it was again perfectly located.We particularly enjoyed Foleys Restaurant with the best view of Times Square.Overall if you are travelling with children of any age this hotel would be a great choice. And even if you are not with kids in tow it is still a wonderful hotel.Although, as is mentioned in other review there was a strange smell in the lobby, however it's not a horrible smell just a smell of something cooking..................just dont know what!!!!! Lol"
203,1898,"Oct 29 2006 	Perfect	We stayed at this property for one night in October and had a great time. The hotel could not be located more centrally to the action and was perfect for either the tourist or business traveler. The rooms are nice -- slightly larger than other rooms we have stayed in in NYC -- and are very well appointed. The guest rooms are on higher floors and are very well insulated -- we hardly heard any noise from the street. Staff was also very friendly, something that you don't always find in NYC.We stayed at the Marriott East Side before and would definitely choose this property over that one -- quality and location are much better. The Residence Inn Times Square is comparable to this property (except that the rooms are much larger at the Residence Inn). The rates are also generally much higher at the Residence Inn, though. We would definitely stay at this property again."
204,1898,"Oct 11 2006 	Definitely would return	It was my first trip to NY and I wanted to stay somewhere in the middle of the action. This hotel is perfect for that. Everything is just a short jaunt away. The room was very clean and the hotel staff made above-average effort to accomodate a rollaway cot and gave about 15 towels (3 women the room), which were very very appreciated. The hotel was very secure. The little drawbacks were that the internet is available only Monday-Friday during business hours (if you needed to do business which I did but didn't want to drag my laptop)...and the hotel restuaurant for breakfast was less than fabulous. However Foley's (the major restaurant) was very very nice for supper and excellent seafood.I would definitely stay again for sure."
205,1898,"Oct 8 2006 	A few rough edges but overall excellent	Having stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites during my past three visits to New York, I was ready for a new hotel for my most recent vacation. The Renaissance, which is only a couple buildings away from the Doubletree, had caught my eye during my last visit, and so I decided to give it a shot. To put it briefly, it was a very smart choice. Although it has a couple problems, they were not enough to sour my experience. The Renaissance is my favorite hotel I've stayed at in NY so far.The service and the people working at the hotel are always the first thing any guest notices. In this department, the hotel excels, with some very friendly and competent staff that not only know how to smile and say hello to you (unlike some other hotels I've stayed at), but they are willing to help any way they can, and do so very quickly. They were willing to supply just about anything you needed, and when one of the sink faucet handles in my bathroom felt like it was coming loose as if it would fall off, they immediately sent someone up to fix it, and the problem was solved by the time I came back to my room early in the afternoon. The concierge was also a highlight. Extremely friendly, always willing to help, and he genuinely seemed interested in what you wanted to know, and gave you a very informed opinion and answer. The staff is great all around, and a great start to the hotel's many plusses. The free apples they offer at the front desk everyday are also great for a snack to hold you over until dinner, or if you just want a quick breakfast.The staff had pretty much already made a great impression, but the room really won me over. You enter the room, and there's a small marble hallway with a beautiful and large marble bathroom off to one side, and an equally large double closet on the other that's so large I was able to hold all of my luggage as well as my clothes, and still have tons of room left over. The room itself is very spacious for NY standards, and comes with a lovely bed that caused me to sleep a little later than I planned to on more than one occasion. (And I'm notorious for being an early riser!) The marble bathroom was also a winner with a deep tub perfect for soaking, and a shower head that had great water pressure. The only downside I can think of with the room was that the TV could have been better, and the reception on the channels was sometimes a bit iffy, as the picture would jump up and down for a couple seconds from time to time. But, it didn't happen very often, and when you're in New York, you're not going to spend a lot of time sitting in your room and watching TV.The Renaissance really pleases in just about every way. The dark wood and marble tone of the entire building is warm and inviting, as well as giving it a special feel and tone that you can't find at the numerous cookie cutter hotels in the Time Square area that are large and have gorgeous lobbies, but feature nothing you can't get in a local hotel in terms of rooms. You get all this, plus the great centralized location. I saw 7 shows while I was in NY (The Drowsy Chaperone, Forbidden Broadway, Jersey Boys, The Wedding Singer, Tarzan, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, and Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me), and all of them were a 5-10 minute walk away from the hotel. I guess the only negative I can think of, besides the previous minor problem with the TV, is that you definitely pay ofr the quality. It's a bit overpriced, especially the in-house restaurant which offers a great view, but the food isn't quite great enough to charge the rates that they're asking. But, at least you feel like you're getting your money's worth for the most part.As if this review hasn't made the point clear already, the Renaissance is well worth a visit. I'm actually surprised it's not higher in the ranking. Hopefully this review will convince more people to give it a try. I may be staying at a different hotel during my next visit, but if that idea falls through, the Renaissance will definitely be my first choice. All I know is I'll definitely be coming back."
206,1898,"Oct 8 2006 	2nd trip - still FANTASTIC	Stayed at the Renaissance in Jan 2006 and had a wonderful time so it was our 1st choice of hotel when we decided to revisit NYC in Sept 2006. Rooms are well appointed with a huge deep bath for a long soak after a hard days walking around the City. The beds are so comfortable it is hard to get up in the mornings. (Thick DURHAM mattresses). The pillows are soft and fluffy. The rooms are cleaned every day with fresh towels left. Rooms have direct dial telephone, internet connections, mini bar, television and a safe for your valuables. Hotel lobby has bell boys who open doors for you and greet you with a smile on entering the hotel. Guests take a lift up one floor from the lobby to the reception area on the 1st floor. This adds to the feeling of security for guests. The hotel itself is in a fantastic spot - right in the heart of Times Square. ( 7th avenue and 47th street). Handy position for visiting all major tourist sites and very handy for the TKTS kiosk for your theatre tickets. Hotel concierge OMAR deserves a special mention, nothing is too much trouble for him. Recommended places to eat - Try SPARKS restaurant for a fantastic fillet mignon. For breakfast - you must go to ELLENS STARDUST DINER on 51st street. Wannabee Broadway stars singing to you while you tuck in. Fantastic experience. Kids may enjoy the MARS 2112 experience - opposite the Winter Gardens theatre - dinner served by aliens. For a real treat, take a river cruise on the WORLD YACHT. $90 dollars each but worth every cent. Great food, music and dancing. The music and view at the Statue of Liberty will bring tears to your eyes.Places to visit - Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, Bronx Zoo, Central Park, FAO Schwartz toy shop, Trump Tower, Grand Central station, Ground Zero, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, NYPD museum and 5th Avenue shops.I will definitely be staying at this wonderful hotel again."
207,1898,"Oct 4 2006	Perfect for first trip to NYC	Just back from my and my 81-yr. old mother's first trip to NYC. The Renaissance suited us quite well. My priorities in choosing a hotel included: central location for simplicity in seeing as much of NYC as possible, adequate-sized room, nice view, and above-average hotel to make my mother's trip special. The Renaissance got high marks in every area.Since it was our first trip, we actually enjoyed being in Times Square--the constant excitement was fun for us. The amazingly convenient access to subways, Grayline HOHO buses, shopping and theatres was fabulous.Our room on the 19th floor facing 7th Street was very large (apparently for NYC standards), VERY quiet, sparkling clean, and had lusciously comfortable bedding. I had gotten a rate of $279 /night through a special offer on the hotel's website, which I felt was a great value.We had a couple of delicious breakfast buffets at Foley's Fishhouse in the hotel. Yes, we could have eaten cheaper elsewhere, but the awesome views of TImes Square were a great way to start our days. Our waiters were very attentive and friendly.The front desk staff and concierge were very accomodating (if not effusively friendly); we had no complaints there. There IS a &quot;different&quot; aroma in the lobby (probably cooking fish from the restaurant??), but we only smelled it in the lobby and it didn't particularly bother us.We LOVED NYC and the Renaissance!"
208,1898,"Oct 2 2006 	Great hotel great location bit overpriced	Stayed at the hotel for two nights. I find that the price of 400 per night was a bit steep, however, given the location, I suppose it was not too bad. I must say, the staff was one of the friendliest in NYC  always smiling, pleasant, courteous, never condescending or patronizing. Although hotel is a definitely 4 star, it has 5 star beds: clean, crisp and very, very comfortable. You will definitely have a good night of rest after long walking hours in the city. Hotels restaurant has the view, but not worth eating at more then once. The food was ok and kind of pricey. We ate at Maxie across the street from the Lobby of the hotel -- decent prices, but beware, the name says it all, portions are enormous and starter salad can be easily shared by 3-4 people. Same goes for pretty much every other dish that we have tried there. Go to Pax for light breakfast and lunch and ask Renaissance concierge for the dinner suggestions  the ones we tried were pretty good!"
209,1898,"Aug 24 2006 	Nice Hotel Good Location	I booked this hotel when my first choice the Marriott Marquis was unavailabe. Hotel is centrally located and nice and quiet. Rooms are a good size, bathroom has a nice deep tub forlong soaks after a day in NYC. I had a room with a king size bed and it was lovely.  I didn't like having to take 2 elevators to get to my room, but,  I will say I never had to wait more than 2 minutes for an elevator. Warning: unlike every other Marriott property I have stayed in, (at least a dozen) that puts a $50.00 per day hold for &quot;incidentals&quot; this one puts $100.00 and doesn't bother to inform you. I noticed it and went to speak to the front desk and got nothing but attitude from the woman there. Not a very pleasant way to start a stay. All in all, though the hotel is nice and except for the rude woman at the desk everyone else I came in to contact with was great. I might stay again, but, it will not be my first choice."
210,1898,"Aug 24 2006 	Great location	We stayed at this hotel from 1st-4th August. The location is very central with easy access to the subway and tour buses. The Rockerfeller Centre is a very short work and it's well worth the trip up 'Top of the Rock'. We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable, although my two teenage sons weren't too impressed at having to share a king bad when I had specifically request two beds upon booking. I'm sure if we'd made a fuss they might have changed the rooms but we were tired after the flight etc. so didn't bother. This was our first visit to New York so had taken pot luck with the hotel and all in all we were very satisfied with the accomodation. The rooms were a decent size and we enjoyed watching the world go by from the 7th floor.My only criticisms really are that the staff, whilst efficient, were not in the least bit friendly and on reception couldn't manage a single smile. Breakfast was expensive but very good and the restaurant (although we didn't have an evening meal there) has an amazing view over Times Square."
211,1898,"Aug 15 2006	Great location odd hotel	The location is great as long as you want to be in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The hotel has an unusual entrance in that you have to take an elevator from the street level to the lobby and then another elevator to your floor. The lobby is not at all glamorous and had a strange odor during our entire stay. Although we thought we had a reservation for two rooms, each with double beds, we were informed when we arrived that the fine print had indicated that this was not guaranteed. I had actually called the week before and was told that double beds would not be a problem. They wound up coming up with one smoking room with double beds and another non-smoking room with a king and a rollaway. The rooms themself are nothing special but do have unique views of the Times Square area. We have stayed at other hotels in NYC and found them to be more user friendly and enjoyable."
212,1898,"Jul 28 2006 	Great Location BUT.......	A word of warning about this hotel. Although this hotel is located in a very centric location the hotel does misrepresent itself. The problem started when I booked a room with 2 queen size beds. Upon my arrival the reservations clerk informed me that I would only be receiving a room with one king size bed and a rollaway. This was not the room I booked. Then when we went up to see the room, it was the size of my closet for 3 people. The rollaway was supposed to go in front of the door. When I informed the hotel staff that this was a fire hazard that is when they proceed to give me a slightly larger room and of course I had to argue with them to get it. On top of all this the first room had a large insect flying around in it, the chair in the room was stained and the room had been double booked. Before I was able to move our things out there was already someone else trying to occupy the room. With all the other hotels in New York City I was not impressed. Stay at your risk."
213,1898,"Jul 12 2006	Wonderful experience	I have stayed in several hotels throughout the U. S. and in NYC and this one is one of the best. For a tourist like me, its location can't be beat: right at Times Square, three subway lines directly next to the hotel's entrance, several others only a few blocks away, saving you a lot of time. All major broadway theaters in the proximity meaning you must not leave your room earlier than 20 minutes before the curtian goes up. Rooms are very well appointed, OK in size, spacious marble bathroom, perfect bed with pillow top mattress, down comforter and plenty of pillows. Housekeeping did a great job, turn down service is available on request. Rooms are a bit dark due to the tinted double glazed windows, but that is just fine, because they keep a lot of noise, heat and looks from the opposite bulidings out. Breakfast at &quot;Foley's Fishhouse&quot; ranks among the best I had in the U. S. and features a new special every day (e. g. different quiches, burritos, cheese blintzes, french toast). As the hotel has only about 300 rooms, restaurant staff treats you very nice and personally. Front desk staff didn't bend over backwards but had at least no attitude, a thing you won't find that easy in NYC. Minor complaint: I faxed my Marriott Rewards number and some room requests (e. g. no connecting door) well in advance to the hotel, none of which was added to my reservation when I got to the Front Desk. I therefore asked for a non-connceting room again and was given - a connecting room! They were apologetic and changed that instantly after my return to the Front Desk, but that could have been avioded. Nevertheless, the Renaissance will be my top choice when returning to NYC."
214,1898,"Jul 11 2006	Fantastic Location!	We stayed at the Renaissance for nine days at a rate of $315 per night. We had a room on the 16th floor with two double beds for two adults and two teenage children. The room was very spacious for a New York City hotel and the beds were super comfortable. The bathroom and shower were very adequate but nothing special. Even though we were not on the best side to view Times Square, we still had a great view. This was a very typical Marriott hotel--above average and clean, but not excellent or luxurious. The Renaissance is probably the best located hotel in Times Square, and thus, a great central location for getting around New York City. You are in easy walking distance of the Broadway shows, Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and 5th avenue shopping. We had great service from the hotel staff, especially Omar, the consierge. Foley's is a nice seafood restaurant with a breath taking view of Times Square and worthy of a try. The lobby bar has expensive drinks and mediocre service, but also a breath taking view of Times Square. The Renaissance is a very practical hotel option with a superb location and we are VERY GLAD we choose the hotel. When I return to New York City without the kids, I will likley opt for something a little more &quot;special&quot; and away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square."
