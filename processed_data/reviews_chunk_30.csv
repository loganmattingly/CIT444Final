115,632,"Nov 8 2005	Super spot	My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend in October, 2005, and will definitely return. This is the third time we have stayed in a 'Citadines', twice in Paris and now London. We like the whole concept of self-catering and the facilities for so doing are excellent here, there is everything you would possibly need. The location could not be better as most of the major attractions are within a few minutes walk of the hotel. We did not need to consult the staff very often but always found them very helpful and courteous. There is a small Tesco convenience store very close to the hotel but you really need to go a little further for a broader range of goods. There is a much bigger Tesco near Picadilly Circus and a good Sainsbury's along Picadilly. I would gladly recommend this Citadines to anyone."
116,632,"Aug 26 2005	Excellent value great location	Looked for a good central place in London and found it! You just can't beat the location, and while the apartment isn't huge, only the kitchen is cramped. Very quiet location if you get a room that gives onto the back street like we did. Friendly staff at the reception desk. In conclusion, excellent and we will be returning soon."
117,632,"Aug 4 2005	Poor Value for Money	Stayed for 2 nights in a 1 bed apartment, with wife &amp; 2 children.Room was clean, but a wierd layout. Toilet was in a different room to the sink &amp; bath. Kitchen was in a converted cupboard - you could not close the door or turn around when inside!! - They should take the door off and make it &quot;open plan&quot;.Main bedroom had a door with a self-closer so strong that the door &quot;slammed&quot; - not ideal when the kids are sleeping in the living room sofa bed. No provision of TV in the bedroom.Housekeeping service is only twice a week - completely useless if you are only staying 2 nights as you quickly run out of towels. They do not leave spare toilet rolls and the soap is so small, it disappears down the darin after one use.Shower was completely useless - although strong water pressure from the main tap, switch it to the shower and it is only &quot;dribbling&quot; out.A continental breakfast is served just off the main lobby - and was quite enjoyable in a relaxed calm atmosphere. Good choice and excellent quaility of fruit - only GBP9.00 per person inc VAT (no discount for kids though - even 4 year old ones!!).Staff were pleasant, although there were more excuses why they could not do/fix things than action.Next time I will be prepared to pay GBP10 per night more and stay elsewhere for better housekeeping service."
118,632,"Jul 31 2005	Perfect Spot to stay!!!	This is a great location - only minutes away from shopping, transportation (bus and taxis), restaurants/pubs etc. We stayed here for 1 week and found the apartment to be all we would ever need. We prepared the majority of our meals here and although the kitchen was tiny, it was well stocked. We brought dish detergent and extra dishwaher tabs with us which was a good idea as the hotel provided only one tab and no liquid detergent. They did provide dish towels and sponge and a small dishwaher is present as well.There is a small grocery store that is open 24 hours just off of Trafalgar Square (just a few minutes walk away) or a larger grocery store on Bedford St ( about 15 minutes away) - well within walking distance and all food stuff that is needed can be purchased there.All staff members were very helpful. We arrived at the hotel for check-in several hours before check-in time and the desk staff very graciously gave us our room without any wait at all. There is a breakfast available but the cost is 9 pounds - which is a bit pricy for a continental breakfast. There is a pub next door and another only a few minutes away - both serve breakfast. There are many cafes and eateries around the Trafalgar square area as well.The hotel provide only 1 set of towels (hand towel and bath towel) per person but they will issue more if you ask. There is free internet usage for hotel guests but only one computer so often had to wait but this was not really a problem once we learned to avoid the peak times.All in all, I would recommend this hotel highly. It is clean and well presented. Staff are excellent. I would not hesitate to stay there again.All in all, this is a great place to stay in London."
119,632,"Jul 9 2005	Good Location and Value But Not Quite Four Star	I just returned from a UK visit that included three nights in London at the Citadines Trafalgar Square. The location is fantastic. It is in very close proximity to many of the major tourist attractions and transport links making it easy to get almost anywhere in London in short order. In spite of that, Northumberland Avenue is really fairly quite given the location. The walk back from Tesco (the grocery) is a bit of hike if you buy too much but the store should hold all you need to stock your kitchen.The services was decent if not overly friendly and they held my rental mobile for pickup without question. Check in was quick and painless. The hotel itself is basically a brand new facility within a 1930s building. My studio was quite spacious. The kitchen was fully equiped with the exception of an oven and it was amazing what they could put into such a small space. It really came in handy and I ate a good portion of my meals there. The bath was nice as well and I had no problems with temperature or water pressure. The air conditioning and heating was individually controlled and worked quite well. The sleeper sofa was comfortable and easy to operate. Not all of the TV stations came in and the stereo couldn't pick up any radio due to the concrete structure of the building. The decor is much like a US budget/mid-range hotel. Think Hampton Inn and you will get the idea. A few minor irritations - no clock radio and I had problems with voice mail.I paid about $150 a night here and at that price, it was a great deal. Some sites show this hotel as a four star property. I would rate it high in the three star catagory. As long as you are not expecting luxury and can get a reasonable rate, I would recommend this property."
120,632,"Jul 4 2005	The jury is still out on this one......	During our recent visit to Britain we ended our holiday at this aparthotel.When we entered the lobby I was quite impressed and was hoping that it would meet our expectations. I have to say I was somewhat disapointed. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The bedroom and 2 bathrooms had a heavy safety doors (other than the living room).which made me feel quite boxed in. The windows in both the livingroom and bedroom were quite small and I missed a sense of lightness from larger windows. When I requested to change rooms for one with a larger window and some &quot;light&quot; I was told that ours was a non-smoking floor and that the ones with larger windows on the lower floors were smoking rooms. We did not get the amount of channels shown and it was a disappointment for our son who would have enjoyed the cartoon channel.The hotel is very centrally located which is a great plus for the tube or walking to many sights. The staff was adequate but for the price of $438 Canadian per night, I felt the services were lacking the rating of a 4 star hotel.As I have not stayed in any other hotels in London, I cannot compare the size of the room but felt that everything was compact and spacesaving much like an r.v. or a boat. There was little extra space in which to layout a suitcase etc. other than lay it on the bed. I have never seen such tiny soaps given in a hotel and our kitchenette was missing water glasses but did have wine glasses. I have to admit, it did not reach the calibre of hotels we stayed in in Glasgow and Edinburgh.I would check out other places before committing to returning to this hotel.A positive comment is that is was nice to have the kitchenette and the living room space separate from the bedroom and that the location was quite good."
121,632,"Jun 21 2005	Good value for money	About the Hotel (in fact &quot;ApartHotel&quot;...)Plus :- Location is perfect (Embankment and Charing Cross stations 1 and 3 minutes walk), also lot of doubledeck buses near Charing Cross. Trafalgar Square is a nice area very close to Covent Garden &amp; Tottenham Court. Perfect if you don't want to lose time in transportation. Excellent pub &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; at the left of the Citadines in case of;- Nice entry hall with one plasma tv, newspapers &amp; free internet access (but only one...);- 2 elevators (8 or 9 floors);- checked-in at 11 am and no problem about that early hour, the room was cleaned and ready;- got to check out before 11am but can benefit of a luggage room for lately flights/trains.Minus :- the staff is OK but not very smiling...- no restaurant (but this is not a &quot;hotel&quot;)About the roomPlus :- Large compared to London average standards : well furnished (modern furnitures), closets, microwave, toaster, fridge... very convenient if you want to save some  or simply have a drink or something to eat. TV (20 channels incl foreigner networks). hi-fi stereo;- Quiet area / we were on the 1st floor but on the backside of the building (very quiet street). But you can still hear what happens in your corridor and in the street...But it's OK by the way, not a major issue giving the fact that I don't like noisy hotels.- Quiet cheap rate (75=115 VAT incl. per night -- Internet rate) for UK- Sofa rather comfortable to sleep in- not huge but nice and clean bathroom with toiletsMinus :- no room service (&lt;7 days)- our view was not very exciting because of our 1st floor positionConclusion:Good value for money, no bad surprises, I have not been disappointed.If you're on a budget (so were we), put 15-20 more to book the Citadines instead of overpay a tiny-no bathroom room in a 1 star hotel in Paddington...Photos will be added ASAP"
122,632,"Jun 20 2005	Bring a roll of TP and a bar of soap	and if you have a lot of room in your suitcase I'd even consider bringing your own bath towel. The towels they supply are similar to the ones you used in high school gym class. For all the limitations of this place (and there are many which are well outlined here on tripadviser), if I take the kids to London again, I would stay here. If you need to sleep 4-6 people you just can not beat the price for this location. Our room was clean. The only shabby, worn out things were the blankets and the fold out sofa. The kitchen was in good working order. There is even a free computer downstairs but you will need to get up at 4 am to use it because someone is always camped out there. So my summary is, this place is good for families and groups. Do not stay here if you are a couple or if this is a romantic getaway. This is not a quiet, full-service, kind of place."
123,632,"Jun 19 2005	Great location but.....	This location is wonderful, just arounf the corner form Trafalger Square and an easy walk to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Buckingham, the West End and the Embankment subway stop. Beware, however. This is not a hotel but rather an apartment of sorts. The staff tries to be helpful but there is no Taxi stand, no Concierge, no restaurant, no fresh linens or room cleaning (unless you pay a fee), etc. It was clean, convenient and adequate for our needs."
124,632,"Jun 1 2005 	Great Location Pretty Good Hotel	Ok, so there are lots of good reviews of this place. So, my middle-of-the-road review score may be off-putting, but please read on. First the really good. It's about the best location for a semi-affordable hotel there is to be had in London. It's steps from Trafalgar Square, about 10 minutes walk from The Eye, about 15-20 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, 10 minutes from Leicester Square and Piccadilly, and on and on. The room was clean and had a well-equipped kitchen. The pull out sofa in the livingroom was adequate for my son and the space was well above average in size. The closest Tube station is the Embankment which is literally 2 minutes walk. There are hundreds of restaurants and shops within 20 minutes walk - location, location, location.The not so good - The price is high regardless of where it is. We booked through Hotels and the price with tax was about $270 per night in May. I travel a lot (Platinum Medallion Delta member) and see many, many hotels in a year. This one is just not a 4-star hotel. It's a 5-star location and a 3-star property. I have stayed in nicer Holiday Inns. Doesn't hold a candle to the Westins, Hiltons, and Hyatts I've stayed in. Sorry, but I don't care where it is. I have stayed many times in London and would readily recommend the Westbury Mayfair on Bond St over this any day if quality accomodations are your top priority.The bad - the toilet flushed with hot water. That's right, hot water (had been mis-plumbed). That same hot water comes from a heater shared by 2 rooms, so if you flush a few times and someone in the other room takes a bath or a shower, you have no hot water for a few hours at least. This was evidently a problem in one whole section of the hotel. I reported it and got a &quot;we know&quot; response. That's not 4-star customer care. Since this is an Apart-hotel (kitchen), there is quite a bit of cooking going on at night. You smell every aroma from the guy next door. If it happens to be fried food (as the guy next door was cooking), it tends to make your clothes lying out smell that way. Only happened one night with us, but one is too many.Minor nits - cable TV in our room only had 3 good channels out of 15 advertised. Washing your clothes in the laundry area (token operated) costs 7 pounds (14 dollars U.S.) per load. Way too high. Breakfast is 6 pounds ($12) for continental fare - again way too expensive.So, in short summary it's got a great location, is clean and fairly quiet, but lacks sophistication and extras cost too much. However, even with the negatives, I would stay there again for the location."
125,632,"May 31 2005	Hated the Staff	You can't beat the location of this hotel and the room was perfectly clean. However, I found the staff to be difficult. They did not seem to know the answers to any of my questions and couldn't have been bothered to try and find out. I also did not realize when I booked the hotel, that I would have to pay extra for clean towels. I stayed for 6 nights so I did not qualify for fresh towels. I also seemed to get an attitude from the staff whenever I asked for toilet paper."
126,632,"Mar 30 2005 	Unbeatable Location	I stayed at the Citadines in March and really enjoyed my stay there. The room is very clean and well appointed. First, I was concerned about the amenities, given that the hotel offers &quot;services apartments&quot;, but they provided towels, soap, shower gel, linens...etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed is a sofabed so if you go there, be aware of it. The only drawback was that they forgot to give me pillows for which I ended up searching the whole studio (but I was given some immediately). Last time I stayed at The Royal Horseguards, certainly in another sphere of hotels, but I liked the Citadines as well and it is cheaper. The location is unbeatable, you can practically see Trafalgar Square. The breakfast is overpriced, so if you care for English breakfast, exit the hotel, cross the road, turn into Great Scotland Yard, and right at the corner of Whithall is a pub offering breakfast."
127,632,"Mar 22 2005	Location is amazing	A group of six of us stayed in this hotel for three nights in March. The room was great, it had 2 separate double bedrooms and one double sofa bed in the living room perfect for 6 of us! The Kitchen area was small but had a good size fridge. The staff were mostly friendly and when we had a problem with one of the doors, the maintenance staff were efficient and the problem was sorted out very quickly. The staff on reception were mostly friendly except for one person who was quite rude at check in.The major attraction of this hotel is the location, 2 minutes from Trafalgar Square, 10 minutes walk to Westminster and 2 minutes to the nearest tube station Charing Cross. The location is worth the price but as there is no maid service every day you have to keep the place tidy yourself and if you require more towels these must be requested from Reception. Despite a few hiccups at the start of our stay I would stay here again and would definitely recommend to others."
128,632,"Mar 15 2005	Great hotel!	This hotel is great. If you stay anywhere in the area you are going to be close to enough things so the location was perfect -- definitely within walking distance of everything you would want to see and also right next to the Charing Cross tube stop.The hotel itself is quite nice. The only problem I had is that our room didn't have a bed -- just a fold-out sofa. It wasn't uncomfortable (like most sleeper sofas) it was just a hassle pulling out at night. That's the only problem I could find with the place.The &quot;kitchen&quot; was well stocked and would be perfect for a stay anywhere - or even an extended stay. The bathroom was also good -- and very clean -- like the entire hotel.Staff was friendly -- internet usage is free for guests (though there is only one computer for a fairly large hotel). Though the hotel did not blow me away, I can't imagine needing anything nicer than what we got here (unless you want to blow tons of money for a really ritzy hotel) ..."
129,632,"Jan 25 2005	Excellent place!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights in late January and absolutely loved the room and the location. This was my first-ever trip to London and I was very happy with the Citadines Trafalgar Square. Some good points include that it is a short walk to two tube stations, the Thames river, Big Ben and Parliament, and Covent Gardens. I loved that the room had a fully stocked small kitchen. Another great thing is that each room is climate controlled so you can make it as warm or cool as you want. It was also nice that they had free internet access in the lobby. The only two small drawbacks I can think of were that a) they give you one tiny little soap, but I guess you can ask for more, and b) you have to clean up after yourself as there is no maid service in the rooms. We would absolutely stay here again though!"
130,632,"Jan 12 2005	Great Location	I stayed here with my husband, three children and mother in January 2005. Rooms were not too tiny - it helped having a 2 bedroom for 2 adults and 2 of the children - you can fit another 2 people on the fold out sofa bed, but there would be no place to eat take aways or just sit around. Pretty good breakfast is available - the usual continental plus boiled eggs and toast. It was a very relaxing start to the day.One minute walk to Trafalgar Square meant that we could quickly walk or bus to most places.Most of the staff were very helpful.There is free internet access (in the foyer); a common-use laundry and a luggage storage room if your flight leaves after check out.This is where I will stay next time!"
131,632,"Dec 2 2004	Can't be the location	This hotel is 30 sec walk away from Trafalgar Square and 5 minutes from Leicester Square. We stayed in a studio from Sep 30 - Oct 2 which was small but adequate. The bathrooms are actually much larger than I expected for London and quite nice. The reception are decent but not the most pleasant I've come across by any means but at 70 a night smack in the middle of it all (you can walk across the bridge to the London Eye), you really can't complain. The location is worth the price."
132,632,"Nov 3 2004	Excellent all around esp. for families/groups.	My girlfriend and I travelled this October with my brother, and wanted to find a hotel that would afford us the benefit of separate bedrooms without the added expense of booking both a single room for him and a double for us.We booked a suite at Citadines based on Internet research and previous pleasant experience with this style of hotel (aparthotels, etc.), and our stay was fantastic.We paid 135 GBP for 2 weekend nights and 205 GBP for one night (weekday), finding the best rates (a special discount) by booking through the Citadines Web site, which had discounted deals not available on the travel sites. With the exchange rate at the time, our 3 night stay was $900, or about $100 per person per night.The hotel's location is unsurpassed. Half a block from Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery (Renaissance - 19th century art), and National Portrait Gallery (highly recommended, and free!). 1 tube stop or a 15 minute walk along the Thames Embankment from Westminster, including the Abbey, Parliament, etc. Just across the bridge from the Millenium Pier (Saatchi modern art gallery, BA London Eye, and water-taxi stop for Tate National and Tate Modern), etc. Embankment and Charing Cross tube stations were both less than half a block away.The building is extremely posh, with an elegantly decorated modern lobby, excellent elevators, carpeting, paint, etc. All very clean. I believe the hotel was a historic building of some sort, but I couldn't remember exactly what the plaque outside said.Our room was on the 5th floor, and had an unspectacular view of a side street, but was very quiet. The hotel was able to accomodate an early check in (8 a.m.), which I am guessing was partly due to the season and it being a weekend. There was free high speed internet access in the lobby, both free WiFi for laptop users and a terminal provided by the hotel for those without computers. I was also able to get signals for 4 different commercial WiFi providers which I could have used for a fee (flat rate/daily/hourly, depending on provider.) We didn't partake of the (expensive) breakfast served in the lobby. Our room had a kitchenette with a combination microwave/grill, stove-top range, sink, mini-fridge, toaster, and dishwasher. They provided cutlery, plates, glasses, and TWO different sizes of demi-tasse cofee/teacups, cutting boards, pot-holders, dish towels, etc. I can't remember if there were pots and pans. However you could easily cook breakfast, do sandwiches, or cook a limited dinner as needed. We did breakfasts each morning. A TessCo (mini-grocery store) across the street provided the essentials. We were very pleased with the kitchen, even though it was small. The main room had a small TV, a writing desk/dining room table, a few sitting chairs and a trundle-style sofa bed. My brother is a big guy and had no complaints about the bed, although I don't think it would be comfortable for a couple. The bed could be split into two single beds if necessary.An iron and full size ironing board, extra pillows and two folding chairs were provided in a small closet. The toilet had it's own separate room (like a closet, I guess we would call it a 1/4 bath in the US) so it was literally a Water Closet. The bathroom had a smallish tub and sink/vanity, and lots of extra towels. This is a nice touch because linen is not changed during your stay, unless you are there longer than a week or pay extra for mid-week housekeeping visits. The water was pleasantly hot. Although a lot of water (flow) came out of both bath and shower, the shower wasn't as highly pressurized as we are used to in the US. It was far better than other European showers I've used. One nice touch: adjustable height shower-head that went up to about 7 feet. I've often had European showers that come up to my collarbone, so this was appreciated. There's also a fold-out clothes-drying rack for doing in-room laundry.The main bedroom had one double bed and another small closet. Not a whole lot of space in that room besides the bed, but it was comfortable with clean linens and good pillows and mattress.This stop was near the middle of a 10 day total itinerary, and so we had lots of dirty clothes. We made use of the in-hotel coin-op laundry, which was one of only two minor disappointments. The cost for the laundry ended up being about $25 for one load. There were two washers and two dryers, and one of the dryers was broken. My brother had to run everything through the dryers twice, (accounting for some of the cost.) and was up until 2:00 a.m. waiting for the laundry to finish (machines had very long/slow cycles.)The only other complaint was the all of the doors had automatic hydraulic door-closers, and no door-stops were provided. We ended up using a folded up wad of napkins to prop open the bedroom when we wanted to easily go in and out (e.g. for packing) and prop open the kitchen with a stuck-open drawer. This seems like something that would be easy for them to fix with a $1.50 rubber doorstop...If all the other Citadines are as well run as this one, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to any travellers. Those planning an extended stay, or who have children or mixed parties who need that extra bit of privacy will especially appreciate the suites. The cost savings of in-room cooking vs. restaurant/hotel prices are wiped out a little by the higher cost of the hotel compared to a lower-end tourist facility, but the amenities make up for this.Overall, a good deal at a great location."
133,632,"Oct 30 2004	disappointed	The appartments were a good size for 2. The one we stayed in was a one bedroom appartment and was meant to sleep 4. I would say it is a real crush getting 4 adults in the one bed appartments. The water was a real problem, the bath would only fill a quarter of the way and then go cold. If the kettle was switched on in the kitchen with any other appliance, the whole place was plunged into darkness!! Service was disappointing and the staff very offish and cold. All in all, only stay there if you must!!"
134,632,"Sep 13 2004	Fabulous Location	The location was terrific, on leafy Northumberland Avenue between Trafalgar Square and the river in a substantial Edwardian building which at one time housed the League of Nations.The apartment was basic but clean and comfortable and the cute kitchen meant big savings on eating expenses. There are two grocery shops within walking distance. I arrived at 6am after a 24 hour flight and was given a room immediately."
135,632,"Aug 6 2004	Tiny 1-bedroom	Yes, the location is this hotel's best merit. The one-bedroom suite we stayed in (there were 3 of us), was really tiny. The kitchenette was literally a closet. The living room had the pull out couch for one person. The bathroom is also tiny and water pressure was a problem. The bedroom was small. Windows had to be opened at night because there is no air-conditioning, so you can hear the street noise of Northumberland and Trafalgar Square. Front desk was not that friendly. It was good for the price and we only stayed for one night anyway, coming back from France to fly out of Heathrow the next morning. Maybe the 2 bedroom apartment would have been better, but for one night, it was ok."
136,632,"Jul 5 2004	Good trade-off for the price	Just got back to the States from six days at this fairly nice and incredibly well situated hotel. One has to get use to the minimal housekeeping (one visit during my stay) and I had to chase after them for another face/bath soap (bring your own!) and for replacement dishtowels. The voice message system failed several times and I never received several messages I know were left for me. One of the two small elevators was out of order for two of my visit days causing long waits. But, kitchenette well equipped and one can save on London's horrendous prices by eating in. Free high speed internet in the lobby a plus, as was the ample room lighting, and the double-paned and large windows made my room airy yet fairly sound proof though nine stories over a busy arterial. Get ready to pay $14 for one load of wash &amp; dry in the launderette. Lots of shelves in the three closets in my studio, plus some drawers for storage conducive to longer stays."
137,632,"Jun 3 2004	Great Location	Great central location, close to all transport but in walking distance to everything anyway. Very expensive though. Houskeeping a bit slack. We were there for 10 days and only had 1 visit from cleaning and then they never left us any new towels. Also the room had a dishwasher but only enough detergant for 1 wash. Laundry service a rip. Also the computer with internet access they had for guests use was not there and had not been for over a month which was very inconvenient. Apart from that the room was great, quiet and dark enough to sleep, the sofa bed a bit ordinary. We had a great time though."
138,632,"Apr 11 2004	It's a toss up...	We stayed in here for a few days in April. It was my first trip to London and I was not sure what to expect from the hotels. Most of the ones we looked at online seemed really small. We had a studio apt, and it was decent. It was great to have a kitchen, (which was very clean). Over all the room was ok. The fold-out sofa bed was horrible though, it was noisy and uncomfortable. The bathroom, although clean, never had enough hot water for one shower and the Internet service was down the whole time. However, the location could not be beat! So, it's a toss up...would you rather have a good bed and hot water or be in a good location?"
139,632,"Apr 5 2004	Location is the best part of this hotel	Partly on the strength of the writeups here and elsewhere, I picked the Citadines-Traf. Sq location from among the TONS of hotels in London for my visit to the city a week ago (March-April '04).Traveling by myself, I chose the studio apt. The real virtue to the place is the location; besides being close to attractions that a first-time visitor would esp like (natl museum, Traf Sq, etc), it had the relatively unmentioned bonus of being right over the river from the South Bank Center. This was my 4th trip to London, so I didn't necessarily need to see the &quot;usual&quot; sights. Instead, I was going for a combination of cheap airfare, touring exhibits and performances. So, the proximity to the So. Bank Center was a real plus -- a 10-minute walk across the pedestrian bridge, and you're there -- for plays, dance, music and even some FREE shows (not to mention saving money by not having to take the tube to and from) ...but back to the apt itself: it was clean and tidy, with some nice amenities, like the CD player that others have mentioned. The microwave and little fridge were also nice.Less favorable points: the somewhat hard sofabed; the unfathomable elec. burners; the lack of an alarm clock; the poorly functioning shower; the high level of street noise at night (even on the 8th floor); and a somewhat lackadaisacal front desk staff.Having said that, for the sake of the wonderful location, the convenience and savings of a mini-kitchen, and the occasional ability to use the free Internet access, I'd still recommend this place. The location really can't be beat. You're a half-block from the Embankment tube station and within easy walking distance of major museums, Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Charing Cross, Chinatown, numerous theaters (and the half-price ticket stand), two major jazz clubs, and the practical conveniences of the Strand.p.s. Be sure to ask upfront about the cost of from-room phone charges. I wound up spending much more than anctipated on phone calls, when calling for event info and tickets, etc. But it's certainly more convenient than scrounging up coins and using a pay phone somewhere.p.p.s. Avoid the Italian restaurant around the corner from this hotel. Mediocre food, high prices. And the crepes place nearby is disappointing, too. But the Indian food from the combo cold sandwich-hot Indian food place on that same street (just up from the Embankment tube station) is great! and very inexpensive and enough for two meals."
140,632,"Mar 31 2004	Great value	A really great location, a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square; perfect for sight-seeing or central meetings. And an interesting change from most London hotels ? Citadines' rooms include a kitchen and sofa beds, and there's no service to the rooms (linen and towels are changed every few days, when they also empty your garbage, and you have to make your own beds).All of that means it's very good value for money, although after a couple of days one can end up yearning for a normal hotel that employs staff to look after its guests!I was in a basic room, though, and the furnishings were all on the cheap and tired side. Would be great for families; my young son loved it."
141,632,"Mar 13 2004	Great Trip	We stayed at Citadines Trafalgar Square from February 19-27, 2004. The hotel was in a great location for the tube and all attractions. It really is just a stones throw away from Trafalgar Square and you are able to walk to Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus, Soho and of course Buckingham Palace.We stayed in a studio apartment. It was small with a firm pullout couch but for all the time we spent in the room, it was all we needed. It also came with a kitchenette which was useful.I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and we plan on staying there again when go back next year."
142,632,"Feb 16 2004	Fantastic value location accommodation	Stayed in a studio here over valentine's weekend. Lovely touch of a box of chocolates on arrival. Spacious room, floor to ceiling windows, sofa bed was huge. Lovely, well appointed, clean bathroom with tons of storage. Well equipped kitchen with kettle, toaster, hob, combi-microwave oven, dishwasher, fridge and all the cutlery you will need including steak knives, cork screw and a fantastic balloon whisk should you feel the need to show off your skills at sauce making!An initial problem with the electrics in the apartment was sorted in minutes. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable.The location is amazing. Trafalgar Square and Whitehall was 30 seconds in one direction, the Thames and the London Eye 30 seconds in the other direction. We were able to walk to a show at the Old Vic nr Waterloo. I imagine that arrivals at Waterloo Station would have a lovely arrival in London walking over the Jubilee Bridges (which are right at the bottom of Northumberland Avenue) to the apartment.Will definitely stay here again."

4,638,Jul 5 2005	Good hostel in calm area.	I stayed at the hostel for 5 nights at june/july 2005.The hostel is located in an area dominated by business offices consequently making it calm at night and at weekends. St Pauls Cathedral is just around the corner (where sightseeing buses
5,638,Jun 29 2005	Basic but well located	The rooms are very basic
1,642,"Oct 4 2009 	Location location location	We found the Clearlake to be a good budget hotel. Its true that it is shabby but we found it to be fairly clean and you couldn't ask for a better location. We have been to London many times and we had always stayed on the other side of Hyde Park so we were pleasantly surprised by the easy access to shops, transport and museums etc. We didn't mind the fact that there was no breakfast because there were cooking facilities in our little apartment so we could make tea and coffee etc. Although there was not much in the way of cook wear or crockery. We paid 70 pounds per night for a studio apartment which we felt was very reasonable. Its no Hilton that's for sure but we really only wanted somewhere reasonably priced and convenient and it was fairly clean. It was a bit 'Fawlty Towers'!"
2,642,"Jun 3 2009 	Don't go there..	we came for 5 nights and stay only 2 - we couldn't stand this place.we got the appartment on -1 floor ..the appartment was very big (for 5 people), but it wasn't clean at all.the smell was terrible. no air. old...the smell of the carpets - disgusting!!!!!!!!the water in the toilet didn't washed properlywe didn't have hot water in the shower at first (but the hotel fix it fast)the location is great, and the area in lovelymaybe the other rooms are better.. hope so.sorry for my english.. good luck"
3,642,"Jul 6 2008	Great location near Kensington Gardens	My 21 yr old daughter and I stayed here June, 2008. Thanks to the reviews on this site, we expected what we got: budget accommodations with a separate kitchen and bath, horrible decor and old carpets/wall paper, and only somewhat clean. The linens were clean but frayed, the bathroom was fairly clean, but because it was warm and there is no a.c., the windows were left open a lot. London air is dirty, and all surfaces collect dust, which the cleaning people do not take care of.The location is great - 5 minutes walk from Kensington High underground station, close to groceries stores, and Naz, the main front desk help, was great for information and extra help.Don't stay here if you're fussy about desk and room condition, but for a small funky apt,. it's great."
4,642,"Sep 24 2007	Rates kept changing	We did not actually stay at the Clearlake because in a three week period, our quoted rate for the same room went from 85 pounds per night to 90 and then topped off at 92 and some change. This after we'd sent one CC number, which they then said they couldn't accept (it was Discover). When we emailed back with another number, we had no response for days. Then, when we finally heard something, it was from a different person who upped the rate. The third and final email upped the rate again and also informed us that two of our nights were no longer available--so more per night for a shorter stay.We chose to look elsewhere at that point."
5,642,"Dec 6 2006 	Enjoyed my visit	Although these apartments are not as up to date as some hotels I really couldn't find a problem with them. I've stayed several times, every time coming away happy. The rooms are clean. The wallpaper and carpets may be shabby but that doesn't bother me because I don't go on holiday to stare at wallpaper and carpets! It is EXACTLY what I am looking for. Cheap, convienent to tube and good shops. The staff are VERY friendly and helpful. While I do recommend the Clearlake the one downside is the fact that there's no breakfast. I found an Italian restaurant just down the road that does a lovely fry-up though!When I come to London again, this will be my first choice."
6,642,"Oct 8 2006 	Not bad for the price	Clearlake hotel staff was very helpful. We knew from other reviews to not expect the best room. We had also booked one of the cheaper studio rooms (#5), but we were given the chance to inspect the room before paying so we knew what we were getting into. Yep, it had old torn wallpaper and old carpet, but the room had been cleaned. They cleaned the room and left fresh towels daily. I have arthritis in my spine and was concerned about the beds, but they were comfortable even in the old studio. The staff was very helpful and honest! I paid by travelers check and one of my checks had stuck to another one. The staff returned it to me when they discovered the error. Laundry was done the same the day and at a low cost compared to other hotels we stayed in. The location was great! Tube was 3 blocks away with plenty of shopping and small grocery stores. Also nearby was Easy Internet store that allowed you to buy an hour of Internet time with a code with a password which allowed you to log off and back on anytime you came in the store. One of the few Internet stores you actually got to use all the time you paid for and could come and go as you needed. Having Kensington Palace and the park next door was great when you got back from site seeing and just wanted a walk through a park. Several museum including the A &amp; V are in walking distance. Although it wasnt the Hilton, the Clearlake hotel staff was great and this was a reasonably priced room in an area where other hotels were charging 200 GBP per night. If you can afford a little more you should upgrade to one of the apartments which are in better condition, but I would stay there again."
7,642,"Sep 28 2006 	Keep Looking! There has to be something better.	There should be a law against hotels like this one. Maybe my standards are high, but there's no excuse for this place; old ripped wallpaper and dirty torn carpet. It was shelter and there is lots of space. The location is not bad, but not great either. The pictures on the website are misleading."
8,642,"Aug 12 2005	Good Value Great Location	We stayed at the Clearlake Hotel for a week in early August. Based on previous reviews and pictures on the hotel's website, I wasn't expecting much more than basic accommodation and a good location. We stayed in unit 15, two bedrooms (comfortable beds), two bathrooms, small kitchen and a large living room. Great view of Kensington Park. The carpeting and furniture are dated, but clean enough. The place feels more like you are borrowing a friend's flat than staying in a hotel room. The trade off on current finishes and fresh paint is space - lots of space. There were four of us, two parents and two kids, and we didn't feel like we were tripping over each other. Quite a difference from the postage-stamp sized hotel rooms we have rented in the past (at about the same price, too). Staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations for restaurants and making arrangements for transport to Heathrow. Convenience store, grocery, and bus/tube all within a couple of minutes walk. I'm ranking it 4/5 primarily for its value:cost ratio and location. I'd stay there again."
9,642,"Jun 12 2005	Not recommended	Unfortunately, this is a case of it looks better on the website. Staff were very friendly and accomodating, but the quality of the room (studio efficiency) was just very bad - dirty, worn carpet, chipping paint, stained wallpaper - unit was just in need of major renovation. It was uncomfortable to stay in and was not particularly clean. Area is wonderful - S. Kensington, just across the street from Kensington Gardens, but with what you have to pay for a hotel in London, go ahead and pay more to have a cleaner, nicer place."
10,642,"Nov 7 2004	Good value considering it's London	Location and friendly, helpful staff are Clearlake's best features. Building is old and apparently high maintenance.We book a studio for four days in March '04. When we arrived, we were told the studio wasn't available because of a maintenance problem. So they bumped us up to a two-bedroom apartment for the same price. Zowie."

2,654,"Jul 27 2009 	Tiny room dirty didn't feel safe	I have never had such a tiny hotel room in my life, and I travel for business frequently! My room was a twin bed pushed against the wall and a desk. There was barely enough room for my suitcase. When I checked in (late at night) and asked the clerk for directions, he told me not to talk to anyone on the street or ask anyone for directions! I only stayed one night, so can't really comment on anything other than the neighborhood feeling iffy (it is a couple of blocks from King's Cross, so very convenient for the train I had to catch first thing in the morning). The room didn't feel very clean, and it was the kind of place where I checked for bedbugs first thing (there weren't any). I also slept with the light on. You must pre-pay for internet access in blocks of hours, which isn't terribly convenient. There was a sign on the bathroom sink illustrating &quot;don't drink the tap water&quot;. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. I feel like for what I paid I should have gotten a little better."
3,654,"Apr 29 2009 	Didn't honour a confirmed prepaid booking. DIDN'T REFUND. LEFT STRANDED!	We had a confirmed prepaid booking and when we arrived cold and tired after a long journey at 2200hrs we were informed they were full and couldn't find our booking. After waiting around for nearly 40 mins it transpired that they had mistakenly made the booking for the following night. I had the confirmation with me which showed we were there on the correct night. The young man suggested we go to the other Comfort Inn around the corner but they couldn't/wouldn't transfer the payment, so we had to pay again for the same night's accommodation. I was assured that our credit card would be refunded as we had to leave early in the morning on the Eurostar.I returned 3 weeks later to see the same young man and he once again assured me that my credit card would be refunded but he did not have the authority to do so. I was told to return the next day when someone would have the authority.When I returned the next morning the person in charge knew nothing about it and was very defensive when I became frustrated and angry with their complete lack of customer service. I still do not have a refund.Be aware that this can happen to you."
4,654,"Apr 2 2009 	A great budget choice	Stayed here for 2 nights with my 2 teenage daughters.Reception staff friendly and efficient. We were able to use the luggage store on arrival and again on the day of departure, which saves paying 8 per bag at King's CrossThe suite was clean and fairly spacious. One room with a double and a single and the other room with a single, also a sofa bed and a little kitchen area with a fridge and microwave. The shower room was tiny, but adequate as you are not paying Ritz prices! The shower was rather weak and the water lukewarm, but it wasn't awful.Breakfast was fine, I don't know what the other reviewers were expecting for the price. There was a machine dispensing coffee, hot chocolate etc, another one for juice, as well as bread for making toast, croissants, Danish pastries, rolls, cereal, cheese, hard boiled eggs and apples.I would definitely stay here again as it is an excellent budget choice."
5,654,"Mar 12 2009 	Really nice B and B	My partner and I went to London for a couple of nights for a break to see a show and Tina Turner in concert (after arriving, we found out tina had rescheduled - but never mind). The otel is a stone throw away from Kings Cross statikon. Staff are nice and friendly at reception. The room was a decent size, and spotless. Breakfast was nice everymorning. Maid cleaned the room in the day (which I wasnt expecting because we were only there for 2 nights, and you can come and go as you please. Its realy central, and only a few mins on the tube from Leicester Square, Picadilly etc. Id reccomend this hotel to anyone."
6,654,"Oct 8 2008 	Good and Cheap	This facility is located within 2 blocks of Kings Cross and St Pancras stations and the tube. It is in a quiet residential section with lots of B&amp;B's. The staff was very helpful, directing us to the neighborhood pub, the laundromat and calling a cab which we needed very early in the morning. There is an elevator if steps are a problem. The price was less by calling Comfort Inn's US phone number than in the website. The room was clean and spacious, there was coffee/tea service in the room with little cookies to tide you over till you get to a nearby restaurant. It wasn't fancy, but with the exchange rate right now - clean was more important than fancy."
7,654,"Aug 17 2008 	Great if you love mildew	Our room was at the top of the hotel, and I guess somebody left a window open and the rug got wet... after being in the room about half an hour, the stench of mildew became overpowering. Paying about $300 US, for a room lacking a bedside light, free internet, but having a noisy street life, and stinky besides, leaves the space (good) and location about the only things to recommend this hotel. Payment policies made changes impossible, and the only alternative they could offer was a basement room with unsecured window. Not that the clerk appeared to care anyway. I love Bloomsbury, but won't come back here. Seriously not recommended."
8,654,"Jun 23 2008 	Great For the Price!!!	I stayed here for 2 nights and then came back for another 2 nights for the remainder time in London. I was just by my self and it did well just for me. The bed was a double but barely fit me(6ft 200lb) but hey its a bed. It was a cozy small room and for what i used it for, sleep and shower, it was perfect for the price. Staff was friendly and breakfast, well um like below, find another place like burger king or alike. You barely can hear the subway but thats what the bathroom exhaust fan is for to block out external noises. Close to everything and loved the 5 minute walk to underground or eurostar :)Only problem was a double charge on my card that was remedied."
9,654,"Jun 15 2008 	Plenty of Comfort at Kings	Stayed here night before going to Disneyland Paris and also stayed here for 2 nights after coming back from there.5 minute walk away from St Pancras. Easily accomodated my family of 5. We stayed in a suite which had 2 rooms. One with a double bed and the other with 2 singles. It also contained a double sofa bed. Plenty of room. A good safe which did not charge a fee. It had a lift so no lugging suitcases up the stairs.A little kitchen area which had a sink, microwave and fridge/freezer. Also had tea making facilities.Bathroom was in good condition. Shower was a bit tricky to get hot water but with patience I managed to get the right temperature.Breakfast was no good for us but there is burger king just down the road.It is hard to find a hotel which can take 5 people in &quot;one room&quot;. Definitely book with this hotel in the future."
10,654,"Nov 20 2007 	Great location and decent standard for the price	I booked this hotel on the recommendation of reviews on this website after searching for ages to find somewhere central and not too expensive. I was a bit wary that it would be a bad hotel, but I was very pleasantly surprised.At 115 it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped to find something for, but I'm well aware that anything under the 100 mark in central London is likely to have some six-legged inhabitants sharing your room. However, the room was big enough for me and my wife, and while the bathroom was small, we only stayed one night and just used it to shower, so it was fine. Everywhere was clean, there was hot water from the shower, and the staff were friendly and helpful. In terms of the location, you are less than 5 minutes walk away from King's Cross tube station, within easy reach of all central attractions.If you're in London just for the weekend and want somewhere to stay on a (relative) budget, you can't go wrong with this place."
11,654,Jul 31 2007 	Nice affordable hotel in a convenient location	The Comfort Inn &amp; Suites is only about a block and a half from the Kings Cross train and underground stations. A few more blocks away in either direction are the Kings Cross Thameslink station and Euston station so the hotel is a great hub for day trips on multiple train lines or just using the tube. It's a good value for London.The hotel has some nice renovated features including the bathrooms. The rooms are can be small (I stayed in two different rooms on separate stays during the same week) but they are up to date as far as European hotels go and they are quite clean. The rooms had TVs and refrigerators. They even had air conditioning but make sure to ask for the remote control at the desk.I had a problem with my reservation but the staff was able to resolve the problem and adjust my rate. They may not be the warmest staff but they are efficient and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.
12,654,"Jun 16 2007 	comfort in the city	Just minutes away from the Kings cross/ St pancreas stations this Hotel is ideal. I even felt safe walking the neighbourhood late at night as a loan female, plenty of shops and eateries in the area.For a budget hotel I was very impressed, I had a very reasonably sized single suite . The ensuite bathroom had pump style toiletries and the water was warm, plentiful with a powerful large shower cubical. The suite had a very comfy bed, safe, tea and coffe facilities, Tv with good reception air con (I didnt use) and the bonus was the kitchen facilities sink, crockery, microwave and minifridge.The room was on the first floor and the hotel was extreamly quiet, no noise from inside or out.The room was also extreamley clean and modern. As a highly sensitive non smoker I sometimes find non smoking rooms have an odour of stale smoke covered by air freshner and this was NOT the case with this hotel.The breakfast room was small but again clean and the breakfast worker attentive without being intrusive. A selection of tea coffee and fruit juice with croissants toast jams and boiled eggs accompanied cerial, yogurt and tinned peaches on offer.Check in aqnd out was quick and efficient.i would highly reccommend this hotel and plan to use it again."
13,654,"May 21 2007 	Good value and worth a return visit	We spent a week at this hotel recently and found it to be perfectly adequate, although the experience in some ways was little like camping out. The room was large and comfortable, but count on purchasing such items as shampoo, tissues, dish-washing soap and wash cloths if youre staying any length of time. No bath mats are provided for the shower, which is tricky to navigate and very slippery. Other reviewers have indicated an indifference on the part of the staff, my first impression as well; but I later found them to be helpful and friendly if asked. Nonetheless, these are not professional innkeepers, and they lack any real sense of service (with the exception of the young woman who cleaned and set out breakfast). Only when asked did we find out how to work the room lights, which require a room card be inserted into a special slot. No one could explain the heating/cooling system, operated by a remote device with indecipherable icons, and the desk clerk finally advised us get used to the set temperature. Nor could they explain the automated telephone message system, which also lacked printed instructions and which caused us to miss a couple of important messages. And it does seem odd, even for a small hotel, to have only one person on duty at any given time, day or night. I had the impression that if anything went wrong with the room we were on our own.Having said that, the hotel was a bargain by London standards, was clean, quiet and convenient. The neighborhood is interesting and obviously in the process of shaking off its bad reputation. The Camden Town Hall, with a tourist bureau, is at the end of the street and there are half a dozen pubs, small restaurants, ATMs and Internet cafes within easy walking distance. Kings Cross St. Pancras station has a wealth of services available two blocks away. But stay on the main thoroughfares and avoid back streets at night: We witnessed one drug deal taking place just inside a nearby alley. I would stay here again."
14,654,"Mar 22 2007 	Great for what it was	I found the hotel perfectly adequate. In London with my mother and sister to catch a couple of shows and take in some sightseeing, all we wanted was a place to sleep which was clean and warm, and this hotel certainly fulfilled those criteria. Having learned - to my own cost - that one cannot always rely on those qualities in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel itself appears to have been converted from two townhouses in the recent past. Consequently, almost everything worked perfectly. Certainly there were no dripping taps, no limescale on sinks, no broken light fittings to be found on our visit.The suite was kitted out with a table, microwave, sink, and cutlery, so on the night that we simply could not face going out to eat, we were able to dine on supermarket fare. The light buffet breakfast may not suit those who rely on a hearty English breakfast, but I found it perfect. And while the woman on duty in the breakfast room was very obliging, the young men who staffed the front desk seemed a little more distracted. Overall, though, I found the hotel an excellent base if you want proximity to the Piccadilly Line, cleanliness and basic comfort."
15,654,"Mar 21 2007 	Great location.	Stayed for 1 night in suite 10 which wasn't too bad at all! The hotel is well located about 10 minutes walk away from Euston Station and only 5 minutes from Kings Cross Station. Underground lines provide excellent access to different parts of London from both Euston and Kings Cross. The Comfort Inn is located in a quiet street with lots of rather basic looking B &amp; B's. There was no road noise or &quot;people noise&quot; fromthe street. There were lots of fast food outlets 2-5 minutes away including Burger King, KFC and Macdonalds. There were also a number of Indian restaurants close by. There was an M &amp; S &quot;Simply Food&quot; in Kings Cross Train station.Check in was efficient, reception was very small but had an adequate supply of information and magazines.The suite was a reasonable sized room for London with a double bed, a settee, a small desk with lamp and tea and coffee and the real bonus a small kitchenette area.(see photos) 2 large windows look out onto the street, the window catches were a bit loose. There was a small self programmable safe which was easy to use.The kitchenette consisted of a small but efficient fridge, a microwave and a small sink. There were knives, forks and spoons for 4 and plates for 4. Basic but clean and adequate for heating up a &quot;ready meal&quot; type evening meal if you prefer to stay in and relax after a days sightseeing, which I did as I was by myselfThe shower room (no bath) was clean and ample towels were provided. Shower wash/shampoo and hand wash were provided in squeezy type dispensers.Breakfast was extremely basic in a tiny breakfast room. There were 3 juices, 3 cereals, do it yourself tea, coffee and toast, hard boiled eggs, croissants, cheese, fruit, yoghurt and preserves on offer. It was OK but nothing to get excited about!I would return here because of the location and the small but useful kitchenette facilities."
16,654,"Oct 11 2006 	Adequate	The room (suite) was large and good value for London. The room was clean and well furnished. The bathroom was spotlessly clean but the aroma reminded me somewhat of Venice. This may not be their fault. Notting Hill tube station was closed that day due to a sewage leak so I guess there could have been a general problem. The aircon was noisy and I had to turn it off at night. Kings Cross was not quite as bad at night as I had feared. Breakfast was entirely self-service (make your own tea, do your own toast) in a small room which included a sink where a member of staff washed the dishes as we eat. Her attire (long leather boots with heels) was perhaps better suited for the occupation for which Kings Cross is noted, rather than a hotel waitress. In conclusion an adequate basic, clean, budget hotel with good suites."
17,654,"Jun 27 2006	sub standard hotel - even for the price	We stayed only 1 night in this hotel which was chosen based on location - which is very convenient to Kings X station. It was an awful experience from the beginning. The person at the front desk would have much preferred to watch his television than let us in and was in no way welcoming or friendly. Our room was at the top of the hotel, the last floor not serviced by the lift. The room itself was attic style, roomy enough but in no way could be called a suite. Very very basic and unattractive, with small kitchenette and tiny bathroom - the only plus was the size of the room. Finding no toilet paper in the bathroom and not being able to get the aircon to work (it was a very warm evening) I went downstairs to ask the front desk person - the simple request for loo paper and how to use the aircon fairly swiftly became an argument. On being told quite rudely that there was a 5GBP deposit for the remote for the aircon I suggested it might have been helpful to tell us that as we checked in or to put it in the book in our room (I had checked) and when met with his increasing rudeness became quite angry with him. At one point he threatened to kick us out which really took it all to a new level of customer service - especially as we had already paid for the room. Breakfast the next morning was OK - but just that. Fortunately we did not see him again.Overall a horrid place in our view. Several weeks later we stayed at the Darlington Hyde Park based largely on reviews from this site and that was a totally different experience in every way - and for the same price."
18,654,"Jan 10 2006	Not Bad At All	After reading all reviews of budget hotels in the area and scared by the prospect of staying 10 days in a closet-sized room, we decided to try our luck with the only hotel that had not been reviewed yet but promised suites instead of rooms. Now we can say we have no reasons to regret this choice.The hotel is made of two adjacent Georgian townhouses. The conversion must have taken place very recently, because the room itself and everything in it looked brand new. The word &quot;suite&quot; is a bit of an overstatement applied to the room we stayed in (suite #10 located at the 1st floor), but it was a fairly large room, containing a very comfortable double bed, a sofa, a low coffee table, a tiny desk with a chair, a tiny wardrobe with coat hangers but no shelves and a tiny &quot;kitchenette&quot; in the corner equipped with a sink, a fridge and a microwave. There were also a TV, a safe (which wouldn't open but we didn't need it) a tea kettle with a supply of tea bags, coffee and cookies. There was enough room left to place one or two open suitcases on the floor and still move around quite freely, so I must say we were quite satisfied with the size of the room.Keep in mind that all rooms in this hotel are very different so your mileage may vary.The en-suite bathroom was not large but it definitely was not the smallest I have seen. It contained a wash basin with a &quot;continental&quot; style tap, a toilet and a rather large shower cabin equipped with a quality thermostatic water mixer working like a charm.The room was well heated even with a window slightly open for ventilation. There was also a huge and ugly gray box high between the windows that was most probably an air conditioner but we did not need it in January.When leaving a window open for the first night we were a bit afraid of possible noise from the street, but our sleep was never disturbed - the immediate neighbourhood turned out to be rather quiet. Actually, the hotel is ideally located close enough to the King's Cross tube station to reach it in 3 minutes but still far enough to avoid most of the noise of Euston Road. Actually, we heard more noise from within the not-very-sound-proof hotel - doors slamming and so on, but it was not so loud as to disturb our sleep.The self-service continental breakfast was rather small but fresh and quite edible. On our arrival the room and bathroon were immaculate, the subsequent daily cleaning was a bit superficial but still ok.To summarize: the best points of this hotel are its very convenient location (for a visitor who is going to use the tube a lot) and larger-than-average rooms. Another advantage for today is the hotel's brand new condition, but unfortunately this sort of things may not last very long. The weakest point is the not so good sound-proofing - it turned out ok for us but may appear unacceptable to someone with lower-than-average noise tolerance."
19,654,"Dec 28 2005 	Not bad - good location	Reasonably clean, good size room, though given ground floor when I'd requested upper floor.'Suite' meant small double bedroom, then another room with sofa, sofabed, kitchen sink and fridge. Not the advertised microwave, but there was one in reception just outside my door.Concerned at first that room might be noisy, I could hear 'doors closing, ground floor' from lift when I first arrived, and some noise from reception and other rooms but wasn't disturbed during the night at all.Breakfast small but adequate, self service in small room and reception.Location - excellent if you are arriving late at St Pancras, King's Cross or Euston."
1,657,"Quiet and perfectly located	We just spent a week at the Commodore Hotel and highly recommend this hotel to others. I have stayed in various hotels all over London and believe this hotel is the best value for your money. The rooms are small and sparcely decorated but are clean and cozy. We had a lovely room on the top floor and enjoyed the peace and quiet. The breakfast was very good as was the service. The location is fantastic and between the Lancaster Gate and Bayswater tube stations. Hyde Park is a stone throw's away. The rooms are inexpensive and if you are like my husband and I, you only need a room within which to sleep. This is the perfect spot."
2,657,"Great location	Spent last weekend in London with friends. Stayed at the Commodore for 3 nights in a very small but clean and nice room. Friendly staff, great location. We arrived at Gatwick and had no problems at all getting to the hotel. Quiet area, nice pub (the Mitre) and a fantastic lebanese restaurant (Fontana) near by. Would definately stay here again."
3,657,"Nov 3 2009 	Smallest room ever	I stayed for 1 night on the 15th of October. I wasn't sure where the hotel was located. I ended up calling for directions. I came in from Paddington rail as I took the London express. It was bit of a walk, about 20 minutes lugging your things around.The receptionist knew I just walked from Paddington &amp; gave me room number (I think) 34. It was on the 3rd floor with no lift, which happens to be the top floor. Seeing I had to lug my things up 3 flights of stairs I wasn't very happy. She said I could wait &amp; there would be someone to take my things up for me, but I had a friend that was waiting to have dinner so I opted to take the 3 flights of stairs. However, check-in was fast and efficient and despite giving me the worst room ever the receptionist was pleasant and friendly.The room was a disaster. There is a photo of the bathroom I had where you practically had to walk side ways from the sink to the shower. I'm 5'2&quot; and it was uncomfortable for me. I couldn't imagine anyone bigger than me to manage in there. There was also no room to put any of your toiletries. The bedroom itself had no room for anything. In fact, the desk was in front of the double bed. The space was about foot and a half from the desk to the end of the bed. That meant you couldn't pull the chair out completely. To work I sat on the bed and pulled the desk towards me. Since the space was so tight, I had to hop onto the bed to get to the other side of the bed as I couldnt pull the chair out to go around the bed.I've stayed at this hotel twice in the past and it's a hit or miss with me. I don't like big inconsistencies when traveling - be it business or pleasure. Therefore, I won't return to this hotel and would not recommend this to anyone - regardless of the location. There are plenty of other hotels within the area that are better."
4,657,"Oct 29 2009 	a bit basic for a four star but great location	I had never been to london before so we were there on a sightseeing/shopping trip. You can't fault the location as it's a three minute walk from lancaster gate tube station and about 20 mins from the marble arch. It also almost overlooks hyde park and kensington gardens. The hotel itself is a very basic for a four star but apparantly this is the standard in London. I dread to think what a 3 star or lower might have been like.The room was nice, bed was comfy and the linen was gorgeous but the bathroom was minute. You could hardly swing yourself, let alone a cat!! It was perfectly clean, however, and the minibar was well stocked. Breakfast was dreadful. A continental breakfast was included in the room rate but there was a very poor selection of cereals, fruit, bread etc. Service was impeccable though. Dinner was also very disappointing. We were going to a show one of the nights and hadn't left ourselves enough time to go to a nice restaurant for dinner as we had been shopping all day (the red shoes or the brown shoes-you know yourself!) so we had to eat in the hotel that night. We asked for two fillet steaks which were tough, overcooked and flavourless and were accompanied by limp salad leaves. So, avoid eating in this hotel if you can.We found the service from all the staff to be quite good. We arrived back late one night to find the room soaked from rain coming through an open window. They moved us quickly and efficiently and were courteous and polite at all times. Also, they looked after our bags the day we were checking out as our flight was late in the evening."
5,657,"Oct 23 2009 	Terrible Stay...Better Hotels for Same Price	My wife and I researched this hotel on Trip Advisor before we left. There were positive and negative comments, but we decided to spend 8 nights at the Commodore Hotel from Oct 16-Oct 22/09. Many of the reviews were very accurate. We upgraded to a suite (room G-5). Although the room was larger, the carpets were very dirty and stained, and should have been replaced years ago. The furniture is very worn, but the general appearance of the hotel and lobby area was okay. When we paid for our hotel online, it included a breakfast each morning as part of our stay. Unfortunately, when we went for our first breakfast, we were told breakfast was not included. The staff were very rude and unaccomodating, and made not attempts to clarify our concerns...they just told us we did not get breakfast. The bedroom had a king size bed, but, they only put a fitted sheet on the bed and do not give you a flat sheet. This means you sleep with a duvet that is kept on the bed from guest to guest. The bathroom was small, and there were exposed electrical wires underneath the sink. No face cloths are provided at all, but there was plenty of hot water.On the day of check-out, after again expressing my concerns, I was informed by the male front desk employee that indeed I should have received the breakfast each day for my wife and I. He apologized and said the other female employee was wrong.Overall, for the cost of the room, we saw other hotels with much better rooms for the same rate. The location of the hotel was excellent, but again, there are plenty of other hotels in the same area with much newer accomodations. In fact, we ate breakfast at another nearby hotel, and their staff were very polite and welcoming.I would not reocommend the Commodore Hotel to anyone. Read the reviews on Trip Advisor to see what others said. We made the mistake of trying the hotel because of a few positive comments, but we should have paid closer attention to the negative comments. The negative comments were right on the money. My wife and I are going back to London next year, but we will be staying somewhere else.As someone who has travelled to many countries and stayed at many hotels, take my review as being very accurate. This hotel should not be rated above 2 stars, and the staff at the hotel are very unpleasant, rude and unaccomodating."
6,657,"Oct 10 2009 	I've been before I'll go again	I have stayed in many London Hotels but am now set on the Commodore. This little hotel really does offer a lot. You are next to great places to eat, Hyde Park, and three tube stops less than 5 minutes walk, not to mention the Heathrow Express and Paddington in ten minutes walk. The rooms are fine, bathroom spotless, and service excellent. The area is very safe, and really nice to have a walk around. One of the nicest parts of London to base yourself and then take the tube everywhere."
7,657,Oct 2 2009 	A safe  quiet hotel in a good position for a london tourist	My room was so small but adequate &amp; pleasant. Downstairs there is 2 beautiful rooms to sit &amp; relax with one of the many papers supplied. The breakfast was a good European style buffet with an additional cost for a hot one but check its included as many seemed this was not included. The only fault I found was the carpet looked very stained but they put in a report to housekeeping &amp; that they didnt tell me there is a gym {but then again after walking all day I did not need it.}
8,657,"Sep 23 2009 	lovely hotel	bad, breakfast only as on two starts hotels, bad coffee and the selection of food was very tiny..they should def. focus on that. There was far too many waiters in the breakfast room which was ignoring as only little space. They should have one who actually spoke english instead.but leaving the breakfast behind, everything else was just spot on!"
9,657,"Sep 22 2009 	great staff excellent food convenient room a bit small.	My wife and I are in our seventies. We stayed 9 nights at the hotel. All staff were very pleasant and helpful. Excellent dinners. Only complaint would be size of room - we found it small but believe this is standard for London. Heating is controlled centrally, not in each room."
10,657,"Sep 16 2009 	Perfect	A top little hotel. Perfect position -across the road from Hyde Park. Public transport and local shops a 2 minute walk away. Friendly staff, clean room and a comfortable bed. No problems with traffic noise.Hot water when you needed it (not 10 minutes later)Enjoy!"
11,657,"Sep 16 2009 	Dont stay on the first floor!!!! Opt fot 7th Floor if and option	Just back from a short break to london with my partner, we had an early arrival, but we vould not go into our room until after 1 as they were not ready. so we just walked across the road to Kensington Gardens, these were fab!! We arrived back at out hotel again at around 6 or 7, we were given room 105, the rooms were small, our view wasnt the best we were looking out onto what seemed all the other rooms of the hotel. we were both woke at 5.30 am the following morning by someone that seemed to be doing a lap of their room up on the 2nd floor, all you could hear was creeking floor boards an doors banging and a television on, this went on until after 7am, if I wanted that noise I would just have stayed at home ans gone to work. When we went down for breakfast at 9.30, we said it to the receptionist about all the noise and disruption at 5.30, she was happy to move us up to the 7th Floor, of this was heaven, what a lovely room, apparantly the room that we had was an executive room, because it had a king sized bed, what ever you do dont upgrade to one of these rooms they arent worth it, and the standard Double Rooms are actually much bigger and newer looking."
12,657,"Sep 4 2009 	Very Nice hotel Great Location.	First of all i must say that the location is brilliant. Situated by Hyde Park, it is a stones throw away from Lancaster Gate, Queensway and Bayswater underground stations. Its also just of the main road so even in the center of London it is quite quiet. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are very clean. I've stayed in bigger rooms for a four star hotel but the room was big enough and the decor was simple but modern. I've had better breakfasts, however you can upgrade to a full english but that comes at almost 10 a head which i thought was rather steep for a bit of egg and bacon. Overall this hotel is very nice and in a very good location, but I've stayed in better hotels at that price."
13,657,"Sep 2 2009 	Top quality hotel but very reasonably priced.	We stayed for one night for our wedding anniversary, and only really wanted somewhere to crash out after doing some sight seeing in London. The location was perfect as was only a short walk from Lancaster Gate tube, and was a nice area too so we didn't feel worried about coming back late at night. Hotel was very clean, receptionist quickly dealt with our check in and our room was on ground floor. Wasn't sure what to expext as we hadn't paid London prices for our room but we had a Superking size bed, wet room, T.V and tea and coffee making facilities. Room was very clean and decor was ok too. I read some reviews before we booked and some people had moaned about space of furniture compared to the size of room. The furniture was big (big bed as mentioned before, and big wardrobe) but plenty of room for manoever and we didn't see what the issue was? We had continental breakfast included with our stay, restaurant was busy but we didn't have to wait long and plenty of choice of toast, cereals, fruit, yoghurts and juices to choose from. Food was nice and staff were friendly and helpful, also very efficient and cleared away quickly making more space for customers waiting. We ahd a thoroughly nice stay in the hotel and would recommend it highly, we did contemplate staying an extra night at the last minute but had to get back for our kids. We would stay here again."
14,657,"Jul 1 2009 	The end of our wedding was completed with this perfect place	I needed a place to stay on my wedding night that was close to Paddington station but offered a touch of class and luxury, and I got that and a whole lot more at the Commodore. We arrived late so did not get chance to use the whole facility or eat dinner there, but the room we got was amazing and in a perfect location with gardens outside. The staff allowed us to deliver bags a few days before and held them securely, kept a copy of the day's paper for us and offered a fantastic breakfast the next morning.I would recommend anyone who is looking for a fairytale room for their wedding night to stay here, or anyone simply looking to be close to Paddington, Lancaster Gate and other local amenities."
15,657,"Jun 28 2009	Great location - Central London	I stayed at this hotel with my father in Sept. 2008 for 6 nights. The location was excellent, as it was right near Paddington Station, subway stations, Hyde Park and Oxford/Regent Streets were within walking distance. We like to walk, and walked from the hotel to Trafalgar Square, Picadilly Circle, The House of Parliament, the Natural History Museum, Buckingham Palace, and St. Pauls Cathedral. Mind you, some of these trips took over an hour and a half to walk. So if you are not up for it, take the subway - as the cabs can get a bit pricey if you are travelling on Canadian dollars. There are lots of great, cheap restaurants around Paddington Station. Amazing location, can't be beat."
16,657,"Jun 21 2009 	I book this place often great! (but don't book a suite)	This is a GREAT value, quite smart little hotel. The double rooms with 4 poster beds are spacious, clean, nicely decorated and charming. The bathrooms are classy and well equipped, and the hotel is so very central for business and a night out. The only down-side are the 'suites' which are extremely tired and not very clean in comparison. I wish I hadn't upgraded. DO book a double room instead, as I often do. I haven't eaten the breakfast (I find it too hot in the breakfast room to relax - but I am fussy!), and have always found the staff pretty nice."
17,657,"Jun 14 2009 	Very poor value for money	After spending 800+ euro for two rooms (2 nights), we were less than impressed with the size of the rooms, the double room was smaller than the average garden shed, the single room was amazingly the same size as the double!!.Would I reccomend anyone staying at this hotel?, NO."
18,657,"May 17 2009 	Ok for what it is	Well located just 5 mins from Lancaster Gate Tube. The hotel is very clean and has friendly staff. Very comfortable lounge with plenty of free papers to read.The continental breakfast has relatively small choice however, the quality is very good.Only gripe - our room was a little on the tired side and had very noisy plumbing. Try to avoid the ground and lower ground floor rooms.My partner stayed here a few months ago and had a much better room. All in all, for the price its a good choice - clean, safe, good staff and save for our poor room Id say its a comfortable place."
19,657,"May 11 2009 	Great location great staff exceeded expectations	A great little hotel, which made a perfect base for shopping and theatre. The staff were all professional and friendly and made our group of five feel very welcome. We were delighted to get upgraded rooms and enjoyed the generous continental breakfast. I would definitely recommend it."
20,657,"May 5 2009 	Maximum 2 stars internet pictures are lying.	I reserved 3 nights at this hotel considering that is a four star hotel on a normal range. When we arrive we received a small room which was one meter bigger than the bad. One of our friend who had a single room, received a 6 square meters room. After we discuss with the personnel, they gave us a &quot;executive room&quot;. This was little bigger but with old furniture and situated at the ground floor with a horror view (pipes) and with a terrible smell. The breakfast very bad. No fruits variety and included only 2-3 things. For basic foods in other parts (eggs) you had to pay extra.I have no objection with the way that everyone is managing his business, but I really don't like the hotels, that lies the customers with nice pictures and wrong information. I think is much fair to publish the real pictures and the real condition of your hotel, maybe so you will have the customers that are looking for this and you will not have so many bad reviews. And also you can also help us to not damage our holidays."
21,657,"Mar 31 2009 	Great hotel Great Location	We stayed at the Commodore over Spring Break and were pleasantly surprised.The location is great, the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms were big for European standards and the water pressure was great. The staff was also really helfpul.If you are looking for a nice hotel in a quiet area, then dont pass this up- You will not be disappointed and dont listen to any bad reviews."
22,657,"Mar 25 2009 	Not bad for the price	I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Commodore with my husband (3/11-3/15). There were so many negative reviews that I was a bit nervous. However, for London, you can't beat the $125 we paid a night and I was satisfied with my stay.I was suprised at checkin. They weren't very nice or informative as I am used to most hotels explaining breakfast &amp; whatnot. The girl was pretty rude. No one helped us with our luggage. Usually we don't need help but this hotel seems to be two separate town houses joined. So to our room 52 it was something like this...Up the elevator to the 6th floor. Turn left and go down 2 stairs, then go up 3 stairs. The go through the door. Then turn left and go down a winding staircase (15 stairs or so). Then turn left and go through the door. There is room 52. Obviously we could have used some help with all of our bags through this maze.The room was a good size and decorated nicely in a Victorian style. The furnishings were a bit tired though. The bed was a king (actually 2 twins pushed together) and since we're used to sleeping in a king, we were glad to see that. The bathroom needed a thorough cleaning. The shower had mildew and it was just grimy looking overall. The room was clean otherwise but a corner of the room ceiling had some water stains. Appropriate amt of towels were provided and replaced each day. Coffee and tea is provided in the room and a good hair dryer was provided (trust me on this one as I have long thick hair and have used much worse dryers in much more expensive hotels).A pretty good free breakfast is provided- cereals, toast, some cheeses and ham, fruit, and breads, butter/jams. You can order eggs, bacon, etc for a surcharge. One morning, no one came over for 15 minutes and then when they did, we were told the kitchen just closed. They did agree to make the breakfast though after we complained a bit.The hotel is located right across from Hyde park and a 2/3 block walk to the Lancaster Gate tube. There are a few restaurants in the area and a really nice indoor/outdoor pub but not many stores if you run out of something."
23,657,"Mar 23 2009	Overall- decent hotel and away from the crowds	Overall, the hotel was pretty nice, but let me first focus on the few negatives:The dark-haired receptionist behind the counter when we checked in was not very courteous when we arrived at around 2pm on a weekday (I would hate to think it was because we were not white, but even the next day she didn't even crack a smile when we spoke with her, but was pretty jovial when she spoke with other guests who were white).The room we stayed in was the Albert Suite - the toilet didn't flush right away, so you'd have to wait around 2 minutes before being able to have it flush properly. There isn't much walking space in the bedroom, so it is a bit hard to iron, for example (iron and board had to be requested by the way, and they took these back when they made up the room the first night).The positives:The Albert Suite is beautiful! Only one quick flight up, the bathroom is off to the left of the little foyer as you walk in. To the right is the curved staircase; this leads to the bedroom to the right and the shower right in front (so there's only toilet and sink downstairs and only shower and sink upstairs). The rooms: the walls are all a red color and off-white color, there's a mahagony canopy bed, everything is in a very victorian style, heavy drapes, tv, phone, hairdryer, pictures of royalty everywhere, chandeliers...The other male receptionists were very friendly and we were able to leave our luggage beneath the main staircase for a few hours after we checked out (it seems like quite a few other people were doing the same thing).Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. The underground is not too far away, and there's also the little shopping street of Queensway that is also not too far from the hotel."
24,657,"Feb 23 2009 	Not even close to what they promise!	They promise a modern boutique hotel... When we arrived late one evening, we were placed in the basement (room L9) in what the called a &quot;standard&quot; double room, this room had NO soundproofing what so ever, you could hear the neighbours talking - and what they were saying. The restaurant ventilation was like a train passing by just outside our window. After a lot of arguing with the very unfriendly receptionist, we were upgraded to an &quot;excecutive&quot; double room. The difference between standard and excecutive beeing a bathtub, and that the excecutive had a little less noice from the kitchenventilation.... Upon check out, we waited for 20 minutes behind a couple with the same experience as we had - and they refused to pay full price for the room. They didn't get any reduction - as there were no manager available to reduce the price...General notes:- Hotel last renovated in 2002 - and looks that way- The bathroom was cramped - if you wanted to look in the mirror - you needed to close the door.- General conditions of maintenance was bad, with fungus in the shower, scratches on the furniture, lock to the roomdoors that didn't work and I could keep going.- Very poorly signed - difficult to find rooms in the hotel. Who knows what happens if there were to be a fire in this hotel - with people running aroud trying to find an exit...- If you just want cheap - find another hotel - that is cheaper- If you want style - and are willing to pay - as we were, there are lot's of good hotels in London, this is not one of them."
25,657,Dec 16 2008 	Poor customer care!!	We had booked the Commodore Hotel for our 2 night stay well in advance but on arrival we were told that due to no hot water on one floor of the hotel they could not accommodate us and had transferred us to another hotel (not within their group). We obviously were not happy but they forced 20 into our hands to cover parking costs and off we went to the Hotel Elizabeth which bearing in mind the Commodore had said was better than their hotel was the filthiest hotel I have ever walked into needless to say we did not stay and spent a long time with the Concierge at the Royal Lancaster Hotel opposite who had no rooms but were happy to ring round and find us accommodation. I am very upset about this and we did not even ring the Commodore Hotel to complain further as I knew that I would lose my temper as no doubt they would have fobbed us off with the usual cliches and perhaps a discount towards our next stay!! Will never stay with them again due to their poor customer service care policy! Also it is to be noted that the Commodore did not even ring us in the morning to let us know what was happening. It really did put such a dampner on our weekend especially as we had to find alternative accommodation and as you can imagine it was one of the busiest weekends in London (we ended up staying in 2 different hotels)!
26,657,Dec 4 2008 	A Good Tourists Hotel	I enjoyed my stay at the Commodore Hotel in London. A 10 minute walk to Paddington Station makes access to Heathrow Airport via Heathrow Express/Heathrow Connect very handy. Lancaster Gate tube is 5 minutes from the hotel and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens closeby makes for a nice walk and break from the busy streets of central London. So the hotel location is good. The hotel itself is a pretty standard tourist class hotel. The staff is friendly and my room was ready upon arrival at noon. To my surprise I had a king sized bed which was very comfortable. A definite selling point for this hotel and not very common for London hotels in this price range. The very competitive room rate made this hotel a good choice. A continental breakfast is included. Unfortunately nothing really to brag about in this department. The breakfast was acceptabe at best. There is an all you can eat English breakfast for ?5 about a 5 minute walk on Bayswater Ave towards Queensway tube which is much more fulfilling. A good stay overall.
27,657,Nov 14 2008 	Fantastic hotel and staff	A lovely Victorian hotel centrally located with all the amenities. The staff was particularly accomodating and extremely pleasant. The room was a delight--large with a four poster bed and all the necessities. The restaurant served a huge breakfast and the dinners were excellent. Check out the history of the grandfather clock in the lobby. Recommended for all!
28,657,"Nov 4 2008 	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Commodore in for 10 days in October 2008. We were a little surprised at the size of the room, as it was tiny, but well appointed. Housekeeping kept the room spotless. The bathroom was wonderful, marble lined with a wall-less shower and a water efficient toilet. The continental breakfast was more than adequate, the coffee great, but after 10 days, a change would have been nice. The hotel is a 2 minute walk away from Hyde Park, close to Kensington Palace, Marble Arch and many other attractions.As with the other reviews, we recommed The Swan Pub 2 blocks away for meals. Entertainment Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.All in all it was a terrific place to stay, we would stay there again."
29,657,"Oct 29 2008 	Tiny room not very clean	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in October 2008, and am having a hard time understanding how this hotel earned 4 stars--even by London standards.I went through several rooms before finding one that was adequate. The toilet was broken in the first room, there was little to no water pressure in the second room, but the third room was acceptable (I think it was newly remodeled). The room could have been cleaner. The duvet cover was stained, as well as some of the towels.That said, the service was pretty good. The bellhops were particularly helpful.I wouldn't stay here again. The location is excellent, but there are many hotels in the immediate area."
30,657,"Oct 26 2008 	Good location decent stay at the hotel	Stayed for two nights in May 2008 for our second trip to London. I decided on this hotel because it's in a different location from where we last stayed in London. I liked the quiet location and was easy enough to get to the tube when needed...pub and convenience store was also nearby.The hotel itself was ok. No issues with check in or check out. Hotel staff was friendly. The room was small but just enough for the two of us. We had twin beds, which were comfortable...the sheets were just ok with its cleanliness, nothing gross. Bathroom was clean and served the purpose. The room looks nice at first glance, but if you were to inspect up close then it looks a little tired...this actually applies to the rest of the hotel.The continental breakfast came with our room...tea/coffee and toast was just right for me. We were actually booked for a double room but asked at check in if we could get a twin room for the two beds...they were able to accomodate and we just had to wait a few minutes to make the changes. Can't complain much about the hotel because it was safe, accomodating, got a good night's sleep, and was in a good location. Some cosmetic work on the hotel and rooms is all that it really needs."
31,657,"Oct 20 2008 	Lovely Hotel stay	A great hotel in a quiet but very convenient location close to Lancaster Gate tube. Well furnished and clean rooms, great price, friendly helpful staff, beautiful public areas and no complaints, except I thought the continental breakfast did not offer much choice."
32,657,"Sep 28 2008 	Great little hotel	My teenager daughter and myself just returned from staying at the Commodore Hotel for 7 nights. The hotel staff was extremely helpful with everything from directions to arrangeing a car to take us to the theatre. Breakfast was great and the staff very effecient and quick.Afternoon tea in the lobby was lovely and the gentleman who served us was very polite and it was very reasonably priced for London. The Commodore was central to everything, close to subway, buses, and parks, but off the busy street of Bayswater, so we found it very quiet at night. Rooms are very small and a little shabby but they are renovating some of the rooms, They were always clean and beds comfortable.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experince all that London has to offer but is on a limited budget.As mentioned by the prevous reviewer the Swan Pub is a great place to take a break for supper and a drink. The Fish and Chips is huge and we shared for a very resonable price."
33,657,Sep 22 2008 	Clean and confi	Small room with very comfortable bed. Very clean room and bathroom.Less than 5 minutes away from Lancaster Gate tube stop (Central/Red Line).There's a pub called Swan a block away and they have live music on Sundays. There is also a small grocery store next to it.Staff was nice and polite.I would stay in this hotel again.
34,657,"Sep 11 2008 	Exellent	We stayed at this wonderfull hotel for a weekend.Very friendly staff, close to the city, the breakfast buffet is really amasing ( quality and quantity ).I forgot some shoes in the room, which they happily send by post to my home address.One to go back !!!"
35,657,"Sep 4 2008 	Staff were so friendly	I stayed in this hotel with my daughter from last Saturday August 30th to yesterday Sept 3rd. IThe staff at reception were lovely and great for help and advice on all sorts of topics, from how to book tours to using the tube and getting best value in booking the tube.They were always most friendly, courteous and helpful in every way.The staff who worked in the breakfast room were also so helpful. Again I found them at all times to be both efficient and friendly at the same time which is becoming a rare combination!!The location of the hotel was excellent and the next time I travel will be with my husband early next year all going well and I have already told him that our hotel will be the Commodore."
36,657,"Aug 13 2008 	Did not like this hotel	Just returned from a weekend at this hotel with my mother &amp; 2 sisters. When we first got our rooms, even though we had requested a low floor bedroom, were put up on the 7th floor which my 70 year old mother would not have been able for as the lift only went to floor 6 &amp; then you had to climb windy stairs. We put our case to them &amp; they told us they had nothing else available, the 2 rooms we were given were tiny twin rooms, shabby looking rooms. We were going to check out &amp; look for another hotel as it was for my mothers 70th birthday that we were over in london , it was only then the staff came up with a choice of different rooms which we ended up taking 2 ground floor rooms which were a lot better but we had to share double beds.The staff were not friendly, the breakfast was badly organised, quite chaotic. The location is good &amp; the reception area is lovely but I have to say I would not return to this hotel."
37,657,"May 27 2008 	Not Bad for London	Overall, our short stay at this hotel was fine. It wasn't exceptional but for a London Hotel it was reasonable. Our room was almost a mini suite which was a very pleasant surprise; it was compact but had everything we needed; tea/coffee facitlites, fridge, TV with good signal and plenty of channels, nice toiletries, mini safe. Cleanliness of the room was brilliant and location was great being so close to Lancaster Gate tube and Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Although reception service on arrival was very good, breakfast service left much to be desired. We had breakfast included in our nightly rate but there was no real understanding from staff who was entitled to full breakfast or continental, guests didn't know whether to seat themselves or wait to be seated and it was all a bit chaotic but at the same time very very slow even when the restuarant was quiet. The restaurant manager seemed to be forever apologising and looked run off his feet. This did put me off dining at the hotel in the evening. This is however my only gripe and it wouldn't stop me from going back for a short stay. As others have suggested, an Oyster card is a really good buy, gets you on the tubes and buses in all london zones."
38,657,"May 24 2008 	A Good Nights Sleep Awaits You	The Commodore offers exceptional service for a reasonable rate, in a central location, but with tiny rooms. The staff is multilingual and are very helpful with information about dining and tourist attractions. There are a few brochures in the lobby area. The included breakfast consists of cheeses, croissants, fruit, toast, cereal and juices &amp; coffee. The rooms are inadequate for American tastes but was functional, clean and had one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept on. The mini bar was reasonable and sensible. We used the stairs a lot because the elevator was the size of a sardine can. The bathroom was five by five and offered only a stand in shower with no tub, and a sink and toilet stacked nearly on top of each other. Besides the room size and view (our window looked at another window) I would call this an excellent hotel stay. When I return to London, I plan to stay there again."
39,657,"May 18 2008 	a fair stay at the commodore	when you check in at the ground floor lobby and you hear the words&quot;your room is one floor down,sir&quot; a little sinking feeling is to be expected...didn&quot;t I cheekily ask for a room with a view?OK the rate was about 110 pounds with continental breakfast included and it was the alternative offered because the hotel we really wanted wouldn&quot;t honour its web price..but why does it always seem to be US that gets the sticky end of the stick? Anyway, going down to the lower floor ,fairly close to the lift, another no-no for us generally, we were surprised by the room itself..L5.. it was fairly big, bathroom clean, bed large,the TV picture a bit fuzzy but only used for the news..but the view was there..albeit by looking up at about 70 degrees we could look up at the church across the road!...anyway it was the location we wanted and it was only ten minutes walk across hyde park to the royal albert hall, where we did the tour and saw a concert in the evening..an 8 quid taxi ride saw is back at the hotel..best not traverse the park in the dark!...shower hot but the towels have seen their best days ...my dogs towel has more body and fluffiness...breakfast was in a swish restaurant/breakfast room..only about six steps from our room to the left as it too is on the lower level as is the gym...ah yes the gym!! at 0640 the rythmic knocking on the wall next door had made me smile , boy that guy had some stamina i thought, imagining a honeymoon couple doing what comes naturally but then the news came on at max level and the banging went on and on...and on...after 20 minutes I had to get up, walk four steps the other way, to the right, along the corridor and bang on the door to the gym, to find that the running machine in there was literally four feet from our heads and the tv situated over it was on full blast with another guest doing her 3 miles before breakfast!! the commodore has provided some entertaining anecdotes for a conversation, we did enjoy the stay and if we stayed again would ask for another room, but when you have paid a low internet price( it seemed at the time) your bargaing powers are limited. would we stay again? maybe..but now we have seen the other hotels in the area we would look around for a better deal.if one was available."
40,657,"May 17 2008 	Good value if you avoid the tiny rooms!	We were first shown room 510 - a cupboard with two beds wedged into it, one across the radiator, the other across the door to the terrace (shabby decking with grubby furniture, overlooking the mews).However, once settled into a room on the fourth floor we found the hotel to be clean, comfortable and a pleasant base for the Bayswater area.Despite the large number of football supporters (mainly family groups), the breakfast buffet offered a good choice and the staff were very professional.Shall use again!"
41,657,"May 8 2008 	Not Really a Four Star Hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Commodore for a week during a holiday in early May 2008. We booked our trip package through Expedia. As I know that British and European hotels are older and smaller than what we would expect in North America, I paid extra to stay at the Commodore for the additional comfort of a place rated as four stars. I now feel that this rating is overstated and was relieved to check out on the last morning.First, though, the good points: The Commodore does have an excellent location. It is right across from Kensington Gardens / Hyde Park. If the weather is nice, it can be a pleasant walk to many sights (Kensington Palace, Diana Memorial, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Harrods). If the weather is bad (or you want to see more distant sights), the Lancaster Gate tube station is only about a 5 minute walk away. (A quick tube tip - Get an Oyster Card to save time lining up for tickets and to save a large amount from the normal cash fare.) The continental breakfast is fine, however, the breakfast room is often crowded. Also, if you are staying more than a few days, you may tire of the limited selection of items.Now, my reasons for giving the Commodore only two stars: First, the room we had was exceptionally small. We were in room 504, which we were told on check-in was one of the nicer rooms as it had a &quot;terrace&quot;. The terrace turned out to be a small balcony with a couple of dirty, old chairs which overlooked an alley. The room itself had no space for our luggage. (We kept it during the week in the doorway to the &quot;terrace&quot;.) The carpet was quite worn and closet space was very small for two people. The bathroom was adequate although roughly finished. However, my biggest complaint by far was the noise of the hotel. Pipes or some other kind of banging went on behind the bed most nights. Noise from other rooms was very disturbing with drawers and doors banging and floors above creaking all of the time. My wife once remarked &quot;the walls must be paper thin&quot;.Would I stay here again? Probably not. Even using British standards, I felt misled by the Commodore's four star status and would probably give somewhere else a try before I returned. I imagine that the accommodation that we had should have been rated three stars by British standards. But, by advertising itself as a four star location (and charging four star rates) I feel misled by the Commodore and have penalized it by giving an overall rating of two stars."
42,657,"Apr 29 2008 	Commendation for the Coommodore	I lived in London for many years so have not had to sample its hotels; now I reside in Greece and to stay just north of Hyde Park was an interesting experience.The hotel is well positioned, being a short walk from both Lancaster Gate tube and Queens Road, with its many shops, restaurants and (Whiteleys) cinemas. The standard of dcor is good. My room, up narrow stairs, with no lift access, was very small but perfectly acceptable. The fact that a staff member brought up my bag helped. Indeed the staff tended to be both attentive and engaging.Breakfast was the only meal I had at the hotel (it has a separate Mediterranean restaurant). The service was slightly anarchic but if you are not under serious time pressure that should not be a problem. The range of food and beverages was good and the coffee tasted like it had caffeine in it.A plus point was that rooms have good broadband connection (fast). A minus point is that you have to pay - although just under 7 for 24 hours is a better rate than many hotels offer. However, this should be free when you are already paying one of Europes highest rates for a room!"
43,657,"Apr 23 2008 	Nice Place Staff	No complaints -- nice, clean room. Comfy bed. Pleasant employees."
44,657,"Apr 16 2008 	A good bet	Initially the heating in my room did not work (this was a day when it snowed in London) so they moved me to another room without any fuss. The rooms were spacious by London standards and are completely modern, though the small TVs were disappointing. The hotel is located close to Lancaster Gate tube and Hyde Park, but is very secluded and I didn't hear any traffic noise. Breakfast was nice, but nothing exciting."
45,657,"Apr 16 2008 	A Lovely Place to Stay	I just came back from spending nine nights at the Commodore Hotel with two of my friends. We were there to see shows,tour the city and check out some wonderful restaurants.We had a wonderful time and all three of us loved theCommodore. After a day of touring we would come back and the lobby always had a great fire going. Its was very warm and inviting. They had a great breakfast and a very nice bar to have a drink. Even better were the people. Everyone there was so niceand friendly towards us. If was asked for anything it wasnot a problem. I would certainly go back. Thank you Commodore for a wonderful stay"
46,657,"Mar 31 2008 	Second visit	I actually stayed at the Commodore once before (10 years ago) and was very pleased then, so it was the natural choice to return. The location couldn't be more perfect, a two-minute walk away from Hyde Park and five minutes from the nearest subway. Also, the hotel has been modernized since my last stay with safety deposit boxes in all rooms and a gym. The one thing that disappointed me this time around was the continental breakfast buffet. It was probably the poorest breakfast I've ever experienced at a hotel (it was better during my last stay, with more choices like eggs and different kinds of cheese). Tea, juices and a few different choices of bread would have been OK for a weekend stay, but was very tiresome during this six-night stay... Apart from that, I do recommend the Commodore Hotel. Nice staff too."
47,657,"Mar 24 2008 	Great hotel	I booked this hotel as part of a package and it is the best hotel I've stayed at in London so far. It was less than a 5 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube station, was in a very quiet neighbourhood in which there was an internet cafe close by and an excellent pub less than a 5 minute walk away (The Swan on Bayswater Rd.), the room and bathroom were very clean and quiet and the staff were friendly.Breakfast was included each morning and I found the dining area to be rather large for such a small hotel. It was busy each morning but I never had to wait for a table. The staff were very attentive to clearing away dishes and replenishing the buffet.I arrived very early on a Friday morning and check in took no time at all and I only had to wait 15 minutes before my room was ready. I was also able to check out the night before I left, as my pick up at the hotel was at 4:25am and I didn't want to have to go through the check out procedure so early in the morning. They were more than happy to accommodate this request. There was always staff present at the desk, day or night.Pictures of this hotel online are exactly what you will see when you get there; no surprises. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it for anyone travelling alone or in a couple. I think it would be a bit cramped for those travelling with children. You really could not ask for a better place to stay."
48,657,"Feb 28 2008 	good great for the money	As with most all European hotels, the rooms were small. Knowing and accepting this, I stayed in the Commodore hotel for a number of reasons, location, amenities, and cost. When I arrived in my room, the bed had a few hairs on the top. Not that big of an issue, we removed the comforter. The blanket in the closet was dirty though and since we were on the 7th floor, the radiator heating had air trapped in it and didn't work. In spite of these technical issues, the staff was extremely friendly and came to fix the heat and bring us new blankets. The included breakfast was delicious. Regarding the location, it was far enough from the night time hotspots so we could get a good night sleep. At the same time it was within 5 minutes walk time to two tube lines. This made it very convenient to get anywhere in the city. If you compare this to an expensive Ritz hotel, you will be extremely disappointed, but if you look at the Commodore as it is, a budget hotel, you will be more than satisfied and extremely enjoy your stay."
49,657,"Feb 17 2008 	It was o.k. at the Commodore	I got an extremely good price and for that, the Commodore was a very good deal. The room was very small, which would have bothered me if I'd stay longer - but it was o.k. for one night. The bathroom was clean but very small - but it wasn't a problem really, since I was alone. It was a tiny but quiet room. The best I liked the breakfast room, and the breakfast itself. The location was positive for me: within 2 minutes I was in the Hyde park - and within 5 min. by cab at the Paddington station. After all: I'd come back again, if getting the same good price."
50,657,"Feb 6 2008 	What a Gem	I booked this based on other reviews as London is such a difficult city to find decent priced hotels that are not pokey and frankly quite horrid.This hotel is a truly wonderful find. It is really good value - I paid just over 100 for one night including breakfast for a twin room through Expedia.The entrance is very nice and homely and has a quality feel.The room was on the 6th floor and was very clean and just the right size. It is not newly decorated but it is still modern and neat. the shower had great water pressure and the toiletries were Neutragena and plenty of them.The breakfast was very good, served in a modern room, with plenty to choose from, from cereal, yoghurts, plenty of fruit, toast, ham, cheese etc which is a bonus as most hotels at this price do not include a breakfast.In terms of location I would say a 5 minute walk from Lancaster gate tube on the central line and is situated just behind the Thistle Hyde park and round the corner from a Corus hotel.I would definately stay again!!"
51,657,"Jan 6 2008 	Excellent stay!!!	The Commodore Hotel is situated near Hyde Park. It is easy to reach by tube (Central Line).Staff were extremely helpful. We emailed them the day before to ask if we could check in early. They made sure we were able to.Our room was on the lower level near the restaurant/breakfast room but we didn't have any inconvenience from it.The room was spacious and much to our liking the beds had duvets instead of blankets and sheets.The badroom was very clean, but maybe a bit too small. Breakfast was a feast with fresh fruit, cereals, croissants,...When I return to London I will stay here again!"
52,657,"Dec 14 2007 	Good value and Service	Stayed here in December 2007 -- Thought hotel was fantastic value for money -- room was a good size for the price paid, everything was clean, breakfast wsa excellent and staff were really friendly -- would definitely stay again"
53,657,"Dec 5 2007 	Very happy at the price	We got a great discounted rate on Expedia of only about 60 quid (price quoted was Aus$138 + tax per night).Room was in the lower ground level. Whilst space was pretty tight, the room was nicely furnished &amp; had a big king size bed, a mini bar and a very nice and good sized bathroom. Staff were helpful and breakfast was adequate. The only complaint was noise - we could clearly hear the gym equipment and tv in there next door not longer after 6 in the morning. However, we were up early, &amp; for the price we paid, we were thrilled with the hotel and would happily stay there again.If we paid full rate though, I would want a room upstairs somewhere away from the noise."
54,657,Nov 26 2007	Excellent hotel!!	As we all know London is terrible expensive. You might expect to much from what you pay but in this case I experienced the hotel industrie at it's best.After checking in we saw that they had booked us a queen size bed. Me being 2.06 meters scratched my head and went down to the reception. They gave me 2 alternatives to look at. Both rooms had a king size bed and I choose one of them. We were about to go outside to have a bite to eat and they offered to move our luggage. Very professional aproch.Location is perfect. Near to Lancaster Gate which is the central line. Hyde Park is a couple of steps away and around the corner you have a great pub!Yes London is still expensive but we did not mind to pay a little more to get this excellent service.
55,657,"Nov 8 2007 	good location but...	Good location on Central Line, nice lobby, some staff helpful and nice but on checking out The person at reception asked me twice if I had taken anything from the minibar, didn't like her insisting...Room on the lower ground floor, next to the lift and staff room, noisy from 6am to 10.30 pm. Breakfast ok but we have the same in France at the Ibis hotels (2 star hotels - about 50 euros/night, not 300 euros as in the Commodore)"
56,657,"Nov 8 2007 	A little bit below average unfortunately	We visited London for the first time and found a great deal with American Express. They claimed it was a 4-star hotel, however that did not seem to be the case. Though it was a decent location near Hyde Park and about a 15minute walk from the tube (train), it was not worth the effort to stay there. The service was ridiculous in the sense that they would shut off the heat every day, though it was in the 40's, there was trouble with the water system, and the staff was unhelpful. I understand that maybe they are trying to save electricity, however, at least let us know that you shut off the heat every day!The rooms were tiny and not the experience we expected from a 4-star hotel. We were extrememly dissapointed with our stay at this hotel and would not recommend."
57,657,"Oct 28 2007 	good find	we stayed here and were very happy with the room and the staff,as with all hotels, you will have differences in staff, some were reserved, but still very helpful, some were quite friendly. we also had the breakfast included every day and this was a real money saver. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to vary the breakfast fare just a little. it was good, but after a week i was ready for something different. This hotel is in a good location, close to the tube and paddington station, across from hyde park, a great place to rest your bones after a long day of sight seeing"
58,657,"Oct 15 2007 	Good Hotel to Stay At	After freading lots of reviews before my trip, I decided to write my review. The Commodore Hotel is a nice 3 star hotel. It's on the smaller side, but that's common for European hotels. The lobby was nice and inviting. It was rather Victornian in style which my daughter liked, but the room was not furnished that way at all and nothing else besides the lobby was. While we had a nice room, it was rather stark being all in white with black trim. The bathroon was bigger than expected, although it was behind a fire door that was supposed to be shut at night, making it awkward to get up at night. The beds were okay but not really great. It was quiet there which was nice. It's close to Hyde Park and many of the touristy areas. The Tube entrance was close by on the Central Line. On an previous trip we were close to the CIrcle Line which is a little more convenenient, but anywhere you get on the tube is great because the lines are easy to follow and you can get anywhere. The front desk people were helpful but not overly friendly. They charged 4 GPD for the Internet (1 hr. whether or not you used the hour). Breakfast came with our reservation. It was a good variety (nothing hot) but was the same thing every morning and there were many servers bustling about so it didn't seem very relaxed. But it certainly saved us money and gave a good start to the day. We ate at the hotel restaurant once (Mediterranean food) and it was all right, but there wasn't much on the menu that I wanted to order. It was the same area in the basement (with a window) where we had breakfast. Our rooms were clean and nicely done done up every day. I would stay there again--I liked the location. We were only there to sleep anyway. We bought a 7 day pass for the tube and it was very economical and easy to use."
59,657,"Sep 16 2007 	Great Hotel - Crappy Desk Staff	We stayed at the Commodore for 4 nights in early August, 2007.Great room, nice bathroom and tub, lovely outside patio, decent breakfast, but CRAPPY desk staff - felt like we were in East Germany in the 1980's every time we talked to them - very cold and arrogant - &quot;not their problem&quot; attitudeThe hotel location is great - near Hyde Park and THE SWAN - a very nice pub, also close to buses and the tube, and walking distance to Paddington station.But we sure missed that GREAT, SOFT ENGLISH HOSPITALITY !I'm sure they hired the staff from the Hanoi HiltonThe hotel was a great bargain....got our room through &quot;OTEL.COM&quot;, and we would highly recommend that website.If you don't have to deal with the desk, this is a very nice London hotel!"
60,657,"Sep 4 2007 	First time staying in the UK...Commodore is a good choice!	Our family of 4 stayed in the Commodore Hotel in July for 2 nights. As this was our first trip abroad and had never booked a hotel online before, the reservation clerk was really good. We booked 2 rooms in the townhouse part of the hotel - one with 2 twins and one with a queen (seemed like a king!). The rooms we had were very roomy. Our teenaged girls room had a huge bathroom. Our room was large but the bathroom was quite small with only a shower. Lots of antiques in the rooms...loved that! Very clean rooms, but we did get some cigarette smoke wafting in the rooms. England had just gone non-smoking so I think that some of the staff might have been smoking near doors and windows. They might need to work on their staff areas for smoking...for example: don't smoke outside the restaurant front door as the smoke really does come in! The breakfast was really good. Lots of choices for the continental as well as the English breakfast. The service throughout the hotel was excellent.Unfortunately the elevator did not go to our floor so we had to go up and down some stairs...but after 3 weeks of hauling our luggage, we were not surprised. The location was great. Not even a 10 minute walk to Paddington Station or 5 minutes to Lancaster Gate. Super convenient location. We found several great places to eat, but one to stay away from was &quot;Zorba's Greek Restaurant&quot;.We would stay at the Commodore Hotel again without any hesitation."
61,657,Aug 28 2007	Decent rooms - super location	Great location - bus stop and subway 3 blocks away. Across from Hyde Park. Close to Paddington. Our reservation through Hotels.com got messed up - we asked for 2 singles (for mom and son) but they had us in double. The front desk worked hard to correct (they were full) - took 3 shots but got nice room. Recommend you ask to see room before you fully check in. Rooms / baths can be small (it's London) but were clean and nicely furnished. It's an older hotel with character - e.g. some rooms had short stairs to get down or up to them. Continental breakfast was decent. Front desk was very helpful. Workout room equipment in good condition.
62,657,"Aug 26 2007 	Great Value Hotel	Great Value hotel, a stones throw from Hyde Park. A 5 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube. Not a massive choice of restaurants or pubs within walking distance this meant the area was quiet at night times though! Island restaurant and bar just next to Lancaster Gate tube is recommended.Hotel continental breakfast is very good, rooms are quite small but they have all we needed ie a bed, air con, tv and shower. Based on the price we paid I would recommend."
63,657,"Aug 21 2007 	Cute traditinal English hotel	I have lived in London twice and this was my first time going back for a vacation. I went with my husband and my best friend and her husband. We chose to stay in a traditional English hotel rather than one of the more well know chain hotels. We got a great deal on-line. The hotel is very nice, it was clean, and the staff was friendly enough. The rooms are small and the bathrooms tiny, but this should be expected from a traditional type hotel and how much time do you really spend in your room anyway?! The free continental breakfast was a nice way to start the day and included so much more food than any continental breakfast I have ever gotten in the US. The hotel is in a nice, safe area of London and so close tot he tube. One of my favorite pubs, The Mitre, is located nearby- they have great food and drink and a wonderful atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, quaint hotel who wants a taste of traditional English accomodations (with private bath rooms)."
64,657,"Aug 13 2007 	no one told me how small the rooms really were	First time to London, loved the city itself. The hotel is in a quiet area by beautiful Hyde park, 10 minute walk to the subway(underground or tube) bus stop one minute walk. It did take 20 to 30 minutes to get to destinations, we were ok with this. Onto the hotel, the room is so small I almost couldn't breathe. There was a small hallway that led to the double bed with only enough walking room on either side. Across from the end of the bed was a smaller closer and table with the tv(small again). The bathroom was a good size but you experienced hot and cold water regularly in the shower. We did ask for a bigger room and were shown one with another twin bed in it which was a foot bigger. We decided not to take it because at least we had a view out the back overlooking all the little houses. Yes you hear noises from the floor above you. The breakfast was very good and the staff was pleasant but not very helpful. When we tried to explain I was having difficulty with the size of the room, I did tell them we had a large bedroom, which I know is bigger than most, but I'm usually fine in most hotel rooms just not this one. When we were leaving the hotel the whole staff started to laugh at us, I found this slightly funny but also discerning at the same time. They really didn't care and said us north americans aren't use to it and shrugged their shoulders. I got use to the room, because of my view and the windows opened. The lift/elevator supposably holds 4 people but I would only go in with my husband, a 3 by 3 lift isn't very big, I guess this is all common for london. Thank God London was worth it. Oh yeah get a tube and bus pass for zones 1 and 2 for around $23 pounds for the week well worth it. I would go back to London in a heartbeat but not this hotel."
65,657,"Aug 5 2007	Basic  some problems	Hello,We stayed in commodore for three nights. * Rooms were nice and basic* Personnel was very friendly. We need to change one room and everything was taken care of and handled in a smooth way, thank you for that.* Location is good, short walk to tube. Close to Kensington and Oxford Street.The only problem we had with breakfast room. It is so tiny that there is no room to eat. Either you push waitresses or the ones sitting next to you. Not a good way to start your day.Anyhow, would stay again and eat breakfast in cafe close to hotel."
66,657,"Jul 18 2007 	Good experience	Stayed here for 2 nights ( Wed &amp; Thurs). three of us - one twin room and one single room. Rooms small but very clean and well equipped. Single room was compact and only had shower no bath which was a bit disappointing. Had a flat screen TV though while the twin room had a tiny portable. Could be claustophobic if you stayed there for too long! but why visit london to stay in your room!Found the hotel quiet but yet it was busy in the morning for breakfast. Breakfast was great - (Included in room rate (Stg 94 for twin and 84 for single) good selection for breakfast - usual juices, grapefruit, prunes, big bowl of natural yoghurt, cereals, bread for toasting, rolls croissants, mini danishs, ham and cheese etc cooked vbreakfasts could be order at extra charge. Staff friendly and efficient and refilled breakfast supplies almost to the end of service. 20 minute walk from OXford street, in an area with a lot of hotels. Very close to kensington Park and PAlace and only a short walk through it ( 20 mins will bring you to high street ken.)Overall enjoyed the stay in the hotel - found staff efficient and hotel clean which goes a long way! Would stay here again."
67,657,"Jun 20 2007 	Great hotel	For the last three days of a wonderful trip to Great Britain, this was one more great experience. The entire hotel staff was pleasant, helpful and available if and when needed. The meals (breakfast and evening) were quite good. The menu choices was quite adequate and once again the staff was there to make sure every detail was satisfactory. I am planning another trip to the United Kingdom and upon my arrival and departure, I'll be staying at this hotel. It was a wonderful stay.....and so close to the beautiful gardens. Much time was spent walking in the park.I would highly recommend the Commodore Hotel as the place to stay!"
68,657,"Jun 15 2007 	Good value 	My wife and I work in central London and needed somewhere to stay for a few nights so we booked this based upon reviews here. It's a nice hotel, nothing spectacular but excellent value for money. It deserves more than a 2 star rating.Location2 mins to Hyde Park, 10 mins from Paddington station, 5 mins from a central line tube and 20 mins walk to Marble Arch. All major tourist attractions are within striking distance but the hotel itself is in a small quiet square. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and it's an area where you can feel comfortable walking around after dark. So not in the hustle and bustle but close enough if required.Roomsmall but clean, showing some signs of wear but nothing to put you off. Great shower and a small bath. This is a room to sleep in not have room service though.Reception &amp; barfriendly and helpful at reception, bar was quiet with nice decor and sensible prices. No attempt to rip you off like many London hotels.Breakfastthe included continental breakfast was adequate if you want cereal and toast. It had cold ham and cheese which we didn't try. grapefruit and prunes were tinned but there was a fresh fruit basket. Hot food was extra but again no attempt to really rip you off something like 3.00 for hash browns and srambled eggs 8 for a full breakfast.There is a restaurant which we didn't try.Overall this hotel seems to have pitched itself at the midmarket and done it very well. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend it to people who want a sub 100 a night room for a few days. You'd probably need to pay nearly twice that for something the next notch-up."
69,657,"Jun 8 2007 	Hidden Gem in Great Location	I was a little worried about this booking as it seemed too good to be true. In fact this was an excellent deal. Fantastic location accross from Kensington Gardens and close to a zone 1 tube stop. Internet Cafe's on Queensway and walk to Notting Hill and Marble Arch make this a great spot. We were in the Townhouse part of the property which was not directly accessable by the lift but were able to use the lift to go up most of the way. Rooms were clean, bright and tastefully decorated. The included breakfast was good for getting the day going. Highly reccommended."
70,657,"Apr 28 2007 	good choice	We stayed in this hotel for a week in the beginning of March. I had read the reviews on the hotel through trip advisor before booking our package through orbitz. We choose this hotel based on price and location to the tube &amp; Hyde Park.I was pleased with this hotel. Our room had a unique set up. When you entered the bathroom was on the right and then you went up 5 stairs to the room itself which had a king bed. Our room over looked the street &amp; Hyde Park. The room itself was small as most european hotel rooms are. The room was tastefully decorated. We had few complaints about our room. Our safe was difficult to open and we had to have staff assitance to open it on one occasion (we have never had this problem before at other hotels). Our carpet was stained &amp; in need of replacement, and we could not dial our friends room in the hotel from our phone. The phone worked fine to call the front desk.We had the continental breakfast everyday which certainly helped to save some money especially given the current exchange rates! The tube is a short distance from the hotel which was great. The neighborhood around the hotel was quiet &amp; safe. I would definitely stay at the commodore the next time I visit london. I also recommend the Mitre pub around the corner. The food was great."
71,657,"Apr 1 2007 	Theatre Trip	On a Theatre trip to London, with some friends, we stayed at the Commodore, first time there, but will not be the last!!! Hotel was in an Excellent |Location, close to the Westend etc, Rooms were on the small side, however they were immaculately clean &amp; very well equipped, hotel staff were very friendly &amp; helpful &amp; the hotels facilities ie: public area's etc very lovely.the one downside is that the hotel would not be very suitable for some disabled or elderly people unless they were fit, as some rooms but not all were only accesible by Stairs.on the whole though the Commodore is well worth a visit"
72,657,"Apr 1 2007 	Great Location	We just returned from a spur of the moment trip to London. We departed Amman on the same day that we decided to spend a weekend in London! I immediately began my research on line for hotels and was dismayed at the costs of hotels and the disparaging reviews of some very pricey locations! I kept coming back to the Commodore Hotel because of its location and mostly positive reviews. So, my husband and I decided to take a chance and booked theCommodore. We arrived in the morning prior to check in time after a very long flight and layover in Bucharest. We were pleased to be able to take the Express from Heathrow to Paddington and then just a short hop from Paddingtonto the hotel by the underground. When we walked to the hotel from Lancaster Gate we were thrilled! Hear we were alongside Kensington Gardens, with it's trees, flowers, fountains, etc. (You must realize that Amman, Jordan is not green). We arrived at the hotel and the staff was very welcoming, checked us into our room immediately, even though we were there early. The lobby, while somewhat small was very inviting and confortable. Tea and desserts were served there if one desired. Our room was an inside room with kingsized bed, desk, chair, armoire, tv entertainment center with mini bar. The bathroom had a wonderful bath tub and shower. Once again, this is a luxury as one hates to use much water in Amman. The linens were quite nice, bed firm, but comfortable and pillows soft. We had a large window which allowed us to view the weather, check the temperature, etc before going out for the day. The breakfast buffet was comprised of your typical breads, cereals, fruit, juices, meats, cheeses, and condiments as well as tea or coffee. If one desired, they could ordera larger English Breakfast. The neighborhood was great for walking and there were many nice restaurants nearby. The architecture was also pleasant, so it was fun just to walk the city and view the different buildings and sites.The only negative we had was that the floors squeaked a bit, so that when the person above us moved about, we could hear it. We weren't in London to spend time lying about in bed and generally they did not start moving about until 8:30- 9:00, so this really was not a problem.I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. I did not see any of the basement rooms or other rooms to compare with, and ours was quite nice."
73,657,"Mar 31 2007 	Beautiful and great value for money!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the commodore mid-march and it went way beyond our expectations. We were in room 106, quite small but with a huge bed and wetroom. It was the perfect place to come back to after a hard days sightseeing, and the underground is 5 minutes from the hotel! The breakfast was well organised and good for being included in the price.The newspaper under the door in the morning was a lovely touch.The luggage storage in the corridor worried me initially, but when we went to pick it up before heading to the airport everything was fine.Overall an excellent stay, would recommend it and would stay here in the future!"
74,657,"Mar 26 2007 	Pleasantly Surprised	This was our first trip to London and the Commodore Hotel met our most basic needs during our 6 night stay. The staff were always helpful when engaged with a question. Yes, our room was small but it was cleaned daily with new fresh sheets &amp; towels everyday. You are going to be sight seeing all day in London anyway so the room is just a place to drop and recharge. My wife and I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast of meats, cheeses, cereals, tea etc. Well worth the cost when you are looking to save a pound or two. The hotel is located directly across Hyde Park which is full of excitement each day with opportunity to purchase local art each Sunday. Two tube stations on the Central Line assist you with moving to and from your sightseeing areas. Local pubs (The Swan, The Mitre &amp; Leinsteir Arms) are all in your area (walking distance) which offer great ales and english food.I hope you enjoy your stay at the Commodore because it is a great value for your vacation needs."
75,657,"Feb 28 2007 	Great Weekend Stay	We stayed at the Commodore on Sunday Feb 25, when my boyfriend and I and two friends were in London for a concert.We booked two months in advance after finding a great deal (56 per room inc continental breakfast) on ebookers.Both rooms were located on the ground floor and we were happy with our lot. We had a HUGE bed, and a wet room. Our friends nextdoor had a slightly smaller room and a bathroom.Breakfast was plentiful, with croissants, toast, cereals, cheese, ham, bread, yoghurt, juices... You could pay for a full english, but we weren't bothered.The location is great, just a couple of minutes from Lancaster Gate tube, on the central line. It's also perfect for Hyde Park.So, all told we were happy with our stay.It's not the best hotel i've stayed in and equally it is certainly not the worst. I would visit again, especially if we could get the same price!"
76,657,Feb 28 2007 	Perfectly adequate	Very well located in the centre of London. We had comfortable rooms in the basement. Got an excellent price from discounthotels.com - a good continental breakfast included in the price. Well worth the money - a really nice find. Recommended.Finnish family group
77,657,"Feb 27 2007 	Very Central to Tubes/Shops/Hyde Park	Just come back from a three night stay, very pleased with the hotel, had a town house room only one little complaint that it only had a shower and not a bath, but apart from that, very clean, staff very helpful. Location is great for exploring London, easy walk to Lancaster Gate or Queensway. Hyde Park just over the road. Would rebook at any time."
78,657,"Feb 20 2007	Great find	We had a two night stay in February. It was a few minutes walk from Lancaster Gate underground station and very easy to find, a great place to be. The hotel was inviting and we were welcomed and everything was very efficiently dealt with. We were on the ground floor, in G8, a lovely double room, but no view! Very clean, bright, with a comfortable bed, all amenities and good bathroom and powerful shower. Breakfast was down the steep stairs to the restaurant - just included continental, but fine on the first day, good juice and coffee - but no meats on the second day, we were towards the end of the breakfast period though! We also had a cream tea, which was pleasant. Good value for money. I am sure I will stay there again and would recommend it."
79,657,"Feb 11 2007 	Great find	We stayed here for a long weekend; theatre trip and museums.We chose this hotel, partly because of its close proximity to Hyde Park, which we love, and also proximity to Lancaster Gate tube stop, which makes everything easily accessible.If you are maybe planning a first trip to London, it is a nice area and very safe, even at night time.The hotel staff were friendly, and responded to requests promptly and with efficiency.The foyer and bar areas were beautifully decorated, with antiques, lovely mirrors and paintings - just as you imagine an English hotel should be.We had an executive room, which is larger than some of the others, (still not huge, but this is a capital city remember!) looks down into the central sort of atrium (quiet in the evening).Decor simple but cosy - dark wood furniture, creams and whites.The bed was good and comfy, bathroom small but well functioning and everything was spotlessly clean.There is also an ice machine on the ground and second floors, which was great for fixing a drink in the room as we got ready for our nights out!The breakfast room is small, and we had to queue for a table on one morning when we were quite late down, the other times we were seated immediately.A continental buffet is laid out - bread for toasting, bread rolls, croissants, butter, jam, honey, ham, cheese, yoghurts, fruit juices and cereals.I was surprised to see that the cooked breakfast option was extra - 7.50 GBP for a full breakfast, I think 2.75 for two poached eggs on toast. Consequently, I didn't see anyone having a cooked breakfast!In the past we have stayed at the Corus Hotel, which is a few hundred yards away, and the Commodore was a huge improvement, and for only a little more money."
80,657,Feb 8 2007	Poorly run hotel	We had not read any of the reviews and just turned up one night in December and got offered the room with the four poster bed and small sitting room up a spiral staircase. One of the attractions was a large bathroom with tub. The room itself was nice but there was no hot water in the bathroom. When we complained they said they could send somebody to look but since it was the evening we said no expecting it to get fixed by the next morning. Following morning still no hot water and they were surprised apparently having not believed us from the previous night. Turned out that the whole side of the hotel had a problem. Eventually they offered that we could shower in one of the basement rooms (which are horrible do not book one of these) They did give us a discount on the room but it was still over $240 but the staff were poorly trained and not at all responsive when we first started to complain. The tiny breakfast room was crowded.With so many hotels to choose from in London we would not recommend it.
81,657,"Jan 12 2007 	Lovely hotel - great value for your money	We stayed on second floor in a stardard double room for four night with my boyfriend, and we loved it!We booked this hotel through hotelsclick.com and got it in very low price compaired to London prices. Hotel was in a good conditions and had a charming athmosphere. Everything worked better than expected. Our room was small but beautiful. Bathroom was in a very good condition, shower was new and worked well. Continental breakfast was excellent, and staff friendly. It was extra that they had considered vegetarians too. Location of the hotel was also very good. Hyde park and also lot's of good restaurants were nearby. We highly recommend this hotel to everyone! A great stay with quite small budget!"
82,657,"Dec 15 2006 	Value for money	Date 13th December 2006Hard to call this a 4* hotel however for the price, 80 very good value. The room was small but functional and bathroom not much bigger than a broom cupboard. If you are looking for a short stay at a good price close to the West End then this was a good choice. Unlike some reviews we found the staff were friendly and helpful. Overall for the price and location we would use this hotel for the odd nights stay in London when going to the theatre. I would not recommend it for longer stays."
83,657,"Nov 21 2006 	Noisy Room	Great hotel, but don't let them put you in a basement room. Even though we had reservations for six nights, we were put in the noisiest room of the hotel: in the basement, next to the restaurant and staff preparation area. We could hear the staff laughing much of the day, and the restaurant noise from 6:30 am until closing in the evening. Fortunately we were not in our room much, but it was very annoying when we were. Otherwise, a very clean hotel with courteous service. Rooms are small, but that was expected in an 1800's building. Street is very quaint and clean. I'm sure the upstairs rooms in the hotel are quiet. I would return, but only to an upstairs room. Loved the location next to Hyde Park, made for easy access to running in the morning."
84,657,"Nov 17 2006 	Stay at the Commodore	The Commodore Hotel is located near the Lancaster Gate and Bayswater underground stations on the Central line in London. Pretty convenient, and its also walking distance to Paddington Station if you are not laden with bags. Reception staff were very polite and helpful and kept my room for me after a lengthy delay at the airport! It was very late... The reception area is nice and there is a small cozy bar as well open late (not noisy). My room was on the third floor and spacious. The elevator and corridor to the room are on the small side. The bathroom was clean and well appointed and the room furnishing just OK. There is a restaurant in the basement which I didn't use on this occasion but the food has always been surprisingly good from other visits always served by friendy and efficient staff. Breakfast is in the same area and one can choose from either a continental breakfast or full cooked English (for an additional cost). The staff at this hotel are eager to please and very helpful. I will return and can reccommend the Commodore, but if only the rooms were a tad nicer. There is an internet access point, but its not free, also internet in the rooms."
85,657,"Nov 6 2006 	Good hotel for Cemtral London	We stayed at the Commodore for 4 nights. Hotel is comfortable, quiet location and clean. Staff weren't overly friendly but were efficient at their job. Hotel is in a good location - walking distance to Queensway underground station.We had two rooms that faced the street and the the small park opposite. Rooms were small but that's London and you only used them to sleep in! We did see a couple of rooms that faced the back of the hotel ( over looking a quiet mews) and they were definitely more roomier!"
86,657,"Jul 16 2006	Pleasant Stay at Commodore	Stayed at Commodore 6/25-6/29 and found both the location and the hotel to be most comfortable. Assigned room 203, across from the remians of old church, nice room with four poster bed. Room was clean and bed very comfortable, heated towel rack was nice touch. Assuming you have breakfast with your lodging, just hit the buffet downstairs and don't order off the menu. Plenty of food. Make time for a nightcap at the Red Bar, open just for guests and is a nice cozy nook. Sizable martini's!!Location is directly accross from the Italian Gardens in Hyde Park and is short walk to either Lancaster Gate or Queensway tube stattion. Queensway Road is an interesting hodgepodge of resaturants and shops, great place to buy pain medicine for aching knees and sundries. Read a ton of reviews and confused about the negative entries on this property, Would have no problem recommending this hotel."
87,657,"May 19 2006 	Disappointing	Just returned from a two night stay at the Commodore as a colleague and I were visiting London on business. Booked this hotel as they had availability at short notice and a reasonable price (#100 per night-ok for London).First impressions were very good, the hotel looks lovely from the outside and this continues into the reception lobby. The staff were pleasant and handled booking in efficiently, offering help with our bags though we did not need this.Our room was on the 7th floor, not served by the lift (stops at floor 6), luckily we were travelling light so not a problem but would be for those staying longer with more luggage. The real disappointments began here, first of all with our room which was small and basic. My bed creaked loudly on the slightest movement though was reasonably comfortable. The view was good over the back of the hotel, and we could see that the rooms below had private decks and perhaps ours were the basic rooms. On a positive note the bathroom was good and everything worked.The real disappointment was breakfast which was a continental buffet, this was adequate but not good quality. The orange juice was very much watered down and we had to make our own toast. This was definitely not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Only 2 weeks earlier I had stayed in another 4 star hotel in london which was actually cheaper but far superior in every way. Unfortunately it had no availability for this trip.On the whole I would say that while this hotel is ok in most ways, it is most definitely not 4 star standard, but 2 to 3 star at most. The breakfast, lack of room service, and generally basic nature of the accommodation all confirm this. It is not good value for money and I would not stay there again."
88,657,"May 19 2006	A great find!	We booked this hotel over the internet for a 4 night stay in London. It exceeded our expectations in every way. The position is perfect for sightseeing...close to a Tube station, tourist bus stop, beautiful Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, restaurants, shops etc. The staff were pleasant, courteous and helpful...although most were hampered by poor English! We initially had problems connecting to the internet and they helped us resolve the problem. The room was smallish but with ample cupboard and drawer space. We appreciated having a safe as well. The bathroom was beautiful...recently renovated, lots of hot water, nice toiletries. The bed was comfortable although only having a doona (duvet) and no top sheet was strange. The room was thoroughly cleaned each day with tea bags, coffee, toiletries being replaced. The outlook onto a central well wasn't attractive but that didn't really matter to us. The best thing was the inclusion of a continental breakfast in the price. It was served in a newly refurbished room and was delicious...plenty of everything, attentive staff and food of very high quality. We would happily stay here again and recommend it to others."
89,657,"Apr 22 2006	Wonderful but needs a little T.L.C.	A family memeber, my son and I stayed at this hotel on a recent visit to London from my home town in England, while on vacation from San Diego. Before leaving the States, I did extensive research on several websites as to the best hotels for your money, and the Commodore was on my shortlist. For under 100 pounds a night, inluding breakfast, for two of us for a 3 to 4 star hotel seemed reasonable.We arrived a little early to check in, and our twin room was ready, so we all went to our room to look see what they were like, and I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the room was small, but thats the way the houses were built back then, so dont expect older houses to have large rooms, but it was furnished well, with dark, clean lines, bright white linens(heavenly soft, I didnt want to get out of bed in the morning), and a private deck, overlooking a residential Mews terrace. T.V., safe, internet point, telephone, hairdryer, conversion plugs, all the usual stuff as expected. Beautiful black and white marble bathroom, loved that.The staff were very kind, very helpful, and by the second day, knew our names and our room numbers, not warm and fuzzy, but friendly enough. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice, and enough for a very filling start to the day. We all did eat at the restaurant on our first night, as we were too tired to venture out very far, the food was obviously freshly prepared, arrived steaming hot, and was very good, however, it would have been nice if the waitress knew more than one phrase in English. Overall, a very good stay at this hotel, but it seemed like a three star hotel, trying to be a four star boutique hotel, and not quite making it, losing the details, like frayed towels in the bathroom, threadbare carpets in places, asking for a small thing at reception in the evening, and not receiving what was promised, not being able to regulate the temperature of the shower, so having to give up after ten minutes of being either frozen or scalded, cleaning of the rooms was not great, sufficient, but not up to a four star standard.But overall, a great stay, and would definitely recommend others to stay there, as it was good value for money."
90,657,"Apr 12 2006	Ambivalent feelings	Just a quick review and heads up for future travelers. We stayed at the Commodore two nights and found it somewhat disappointing for a four star hotel. The room was identical to what we saw on the web and we had a nice view out of the front of the building towards Hyde Park. The bathroom was adequate but needed some superficial repair. The front windows did not entirely close. The carpeting needed cleaning and we were charged for a bar fee which we did not use. The staff was friendly, and responded to our requests but did not go out of their way to inquire how we were doing. The restaurant downstairs was convenient, but a tad disappointing. We got the impression that there were staffing changes going on in the hotel. Overall, I would probably try another hotel on our next trip abroad."
91,657,"Mar 28 2006	Tiny room	This hotel had problems. When we arrived, the elevator didn't work for all floors. The room was tiny, and when I say tiny, I mean it. Not enough space. The place could have been cleaner.The breakfast was great, good food and included in the reservation. This is a 2 star hotel, not more."
92,657,"Jan 28 2006	Nice place but needs a lot of help!	I took my mom on a trip to Europe. We had not been back in 30 years, so I took my time finding the right places. Or so I thought. We arrived at the Commodore and the daytime desk help were a bit put off with helping. They did not want us to leave the hotel with our room key, which is odd for Americans. There were, however, the night shift people who were wonderful. Very friendly and extremely helpful. We truly enjoyed their company on all levels. Our rooms were on the &quot;second&quot; (3rd) floor. The rooms windows opened on the atrium area in the center of the hotel which made them nice and bright. My room was more or less okay, the carpet was dirty enough to not want to walk barefoot on, the bathroom was in need of a good cleaning but okay. My mom's room was next door, the heater did not work the whole week we were there, they came up numerous times to fix it but never did. Her heated towel rack was broken, her coffee maker was broken. It would seem that these things would be noticed on cleaning, but that seems to be an issue. The place was livable but needed help. Internet wasn't available in our rooms so we needed to utilize the lobby area and it felt awkward as well as imposing to ask to use something we were paying for. The bar was only open during minimum hours and only if there was extra staff to run it. Restaurant is in the basement and wasn't bad, actually a good deal for the money. Was empty each time we went in, so service was very good, being one on one like it was. The park was nearby and easy to access as well as the tubes. Would stay again, simply because of the staff. They were wonderful."
93,657,"Jan 4 2006	Good Value -- with a Bit of Cleaning/Repair	Off Hyde Park, the Commodore looks quite elegant from the outside. Entering the reception area continues the impression, as the staff is helpful, attentive, and well-dressed. The single room I ordered was small but certainly sufficient, with simple but tasetful furnishings. A bit of noise from the main drag a block away, but not overwhelming. There is an in-room Internet connection (not wireless) for seven pounds from noon to noon, which was a nice option.The bathroom was the only disappointment. The showerhead was cracked a sprayed water all over the room, which you think might have been noticed during the last cleaning. But then the bathroom could use a real cleaning anyway, and its odor was the first thing you noticed when entering the room. With a bathroom, small is okay, smell is not.Standard continental breakfast is included, as is access to the Commodore's simple fitness room with a climber/elliptical hybrid, a treadmill, and free weights.The neighborhood isn't full of restaurants, pubs, and cafes, but it has a few and a decent walk or a ride from the Lancaster Gate underground station three blocks away can get you to more lively locales. There are several other hotels around the Commodore, and security coming back from dinner or a show isn't a major problem."
94,657,Dec 3 2005	Nice place	We stayed in London for 3 nights in Oct and thought that the Commodore was a great deal for the price. London can be a pricey place to visit and we had no complaints about the Commodore.It is close to the tube station and you can walk around Hyde Park easily.Would stay again.
95,657,"Nov 2 2005	Good place for a short stay in London	This hotel is very convenient, as it is near to two tube stations, hence you can go anywhere in London with no need of looking too much around for the subway. We found the hotel quite silent. Although our room was near to a lift, we never heard any noise from it. In the room next to our, a man started talking on the phone in the middle of the night and we clearly heard him, so we found insonorization room/room insufficient.The bathroom was surprisingly wide, shower did not work 100% well but we had no problem. The room was not too big (but acceptable for two people) but very clean, a bit too much warm but during last days we had high temps in London, maybe that helped in this.Breakfast was average, they have excellent Greek Yoghurt but toasts were not top notch. The food was same type all the four days we stayed The young staff was very kind and attentive, we appreciated their help.the price make it a good spot to stay in London. It's in front of Kensington Gardens but off the noise of Bayswater. For sure a place to consider for a short stay considering the price."
96,657,"Oct 17 2005	Very nice hotel	We stayed at the Commodore Hotel in England from September 19 through Septemeber 25, 2005. It was in a lovely area (many hotels, across two streets from Kensington Gardens and easily accessible to the underground and many restaurants) and was a beautiful old building. The only problem we discovered was that our room was on a half floor, so we had to climb down one flight of stairs to reach it from the elevator. We arrived at the hotel about 11PM and there was no porter, so we had to take our bags ourselves. The room was a good size for a European hotel with character. The hotel had a nice little bar and a good breakfast buffet. Most of the staff were foreign, very polite and good at their jobs, but not extremely helpful when it came to asking tourist questions.I would recommend the Commodore, but be sure your room is directly accessible by the elevator. Also, be careful, there is a laundromat a few blocks away where we did our laundry and we had problems with the attendant. One dryer we used had some kind of plastic residue and ruined some clothing. The attendance refused to do anything, not even contact the owner."
97,657,"Oct 11 2005	Never again! 	We had stayed in Commodore in April 2004 and it was a very pleasent stay in a original victorian style room in a great location. We booked it again in May 2005. We got a schock as we saw our room. As we were expecting a similiar room , we got a very badly decorated room besides elevator with 2 big and 1 small bed where 5 people could easily stay although we had booked it just for two. The heating in the room was out of order and the room was like a sauna. As we asked them how this could happen because we had completely other styled room last year for the same price. They told us that most probably we were upgraded to townhouse room last year and what we have now is their standart room! As we asked them to change because of heating and elevator, they told us that they have no rooms available. Because of the fact that it was impossible to sleep in the room because of the heating &amp; noise of elevator, in the middle of the night we went down and demanded another room. They moved us to a room in the attic where it was impssible to move&amp; sleep as two . After a sleepless night &amp; making a big scandal with the manager, they found an available room in the basement. At least far away from the elvator and with a functioning heating and big enough for two!We were schocked how they are allowed to sell such boxes as rooms! This was our worst hotel experience worldwide!"
98,657,"Oct 4 2005	A cozy home away from home....	I was beyond impressed this past summer when I unexpectedly had the great fortune of spending 7 nights at the Commodore Hotel in London. It seemed every member of the staff went out of their way for me. The room was very cozy, and the bedding was very much like Westin's benchmark &quot;Heavenly&quot;. I'm not exaggerating when I say I felt sad to leave. I'll be back again next summer."
99,657,"Sep 2 2005	Rooms so small you could not turn around	I really liked the lobby and breakfast room at this hotel. However, the room was so small that it was very uncomfortable. It was a corner room and the bed took up the entire room. I know hotel rooms are generally small in London, but this was ridiculous. The breakfast was very good and the service was wonderful. The corner rooms should not be rooms, but broom closets."
100,657,"May 20 2005	reasonable hotel	Stayed in this hotel in April 05. Location is good on a quiet square and five minutes walk to Lancaster Gate Tube station on the Central line and a few minutes from Hyde Park. The area round the hotel is nice and quiet at night.The room was really small and particularly the bathroom was too small. The beds, however, were comfortable. There was a tv, safe and minibar. The hotel has a small lift and corridors. Hotel price included a reasonable continental breakfast. Not very much variation in meat and cheese. There is no secure luggage store (the staff put the luggage under the stairs). Staff is polite and helpful. Overall, not too bad hotel as long as the price is reasonable. Dont expect too much."
101,657,"Apr 18 2005	Great Hotel	Stayed in this hotel in April 05. Booked at on lastminute 5 days before travelling. Booked a twin room for 82.The hotel has a fantastic location just off Hyde Park and only 5 mins max walk from Lancaster Gate Tube Station.The room wasn't the biggest I've seen but it was perfect for what we needed. Very comfortable beds, tv, safe, minibar and private bathroom. The bath was rather tricky to get out of as sides very high. But everything was perfectly clean. Crisp white bedding.Staff very friendly and we were able to leave our luggage after checking out. Price included a continental breakfast - perfectly adequate. You could pay extra for a cooked breadfast.Cannot comment on either the restaurant or bar, though did look into the bar and it looked very cosy.The hotel furniture was all old style which made it a bit different from your average hotels which all look the same.Would definately recommend here and would stay again."
102,657,Mar 10 2005	A nice hotel for the London area	The Commodore hotel is a nice hotel to stay in London. The location was great. It was a white buliding with trees and with a church near by. The looby was tiny but with great deco. All though the service was not as good as the location. My family and I wanted another bed for a family member to sleep in. Well that didn't happen. So all four of us were crammed in a full size bed! The bathroom was like a closet. But for the sightseers this hotel would be okay because you would not be in your room very often!! I hope you find this review somewhat helpful.
103,657,"Jan 30 2005	Nice and Quiet	Ok it may have a small lift, corridors and dining room but the bedrooms have character are comfortable and are far better than the box type room at modern hotels. The area round the hotel is really nice and very quiet at night so you do not get woken up because of traffic or trains. One small point is that the gym could do with an excercise bike."
104,657,"Jan 29 2005	Excellent value in a quiet location	We took advantage of a late-booking rate on the day offered directly by the hotel over the phone which was half the web site rate. A polite request for a non-smoking, quiet room resulted in us being allocated to a splendid executive room on the lower ground floor. Don't panic - it isn't a basement and is one of four with large windows and doors opening onto an internal terrace. The terrace would be nice to sit outside on in summer. The bathroom had only a shower which might not suit everyone but was fine for us. Everything was very clean and we were pleasantly surprised to find high quality features like a down duvet and queen size bed with a good quality, firm mattress. There is also a small mini-bar which was big enough to take some fresh milk for our coffee. A hospitality tray with tea and coffee is provided, although there was no decaffinated or herb teas on offer. They are probably available on request.There are small features which could use attention in an executive standard room, like a damaged picture frame, but everything was functional. The rate included a continental breakfast and this is the only thing I would rate as poor. The pastries and cold meat (only one on offer) were not good quality and the cheese unimaginative. We didn't try the optional cooked breakfast, but this might be preferable.The hotel staff were helpful and friendly and are happy to store your luggage after checkout. Note that this is not a secure luggage store, so don't leave any valuables.Location is very good being set away from Bayswater Road on a quiet square and two minutes walk to Lancaster Gate tube station on the Central line, so you can get around easily. Conveniently, there's a tiny general store between the tube station and the hotel which sells emergency toothpaste, bottled water, etc. Overall, recommended as excellent value for money. We will use them again."
105,657,"Jan 28 2005	Amazing hotel cant find one thing wrong with this hotel!	Excellent location - 1 minute from hyde park, 2 minutes from tube station, off the main road in a quiet square next to a beautiful cathedral.Staff are friendly helpful, breakfast is delicious.Although the rooms are a bit small, they are clean, tidy well furnished and the bathrooms are very nice.I will definately stay here again due to its excellent, safe location."
106,657,"Jan 6 2005	Convenient location and reasonable place to stay....	My family and I have just returned from our stay in London. We started and ended our visit to Great Britain, at the Commodore. I can't say that I wasn't somewhat disappointed that the charming room pictured on the internet was not the one we were assigned to, and that initially the basement rooms seemed somewhat strange--however we were right next door to our three children, and close by to the restarant, so therefore conveniently located, for breakfast. Our rooms did not have much of a view, being on the courtyard(L3 and L6), but were clean and comfortable.We preferred the size of the bathroom, in the second room we had, for our last night in London(403), though still no charming antiques, and the extra money we paid for a better room was not particularly evident. All in all though, the Commodore Hotel was convenient and a fairly reasonably priced place to stay. (December,2004)"
107,657,"Jan 4 2005	Loved the welcome tray (tea coffee...)	Nice hotel in a quiet place.The people at the desk are just not smiling.The room was nice and cosy, the breakfast tempting.May be 4 stars is a bit too much.The rooms and particularly the bathroom are too small."
108,657,"Dec 26 2004	Great location 	My husband and I stayed at The Commodore from Nov. 24-27th. The hotel is very well located on a quiet street close to Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate &amp; Paddington tube stations. The breakfast that was included with the rate was very good. The biggest drawback was the terrible shower facilities. If the water wasn't freezing cold it was scalding hot and never anything in between! Would I stay there again? Probably if I could get another fantastic rate like our last stay."
109,657,"Nov 9 2004	Terrible Hotel	I booked this hotel with Lastminute for 95 for Saturday night. I was expecting a 4 star hotel.I was shown a standard double room in the Townhouse - do not stay in this part of the hotel, the rooms are hardly big enough to swing a cat and stunk of smoke. After being shown a second room which was as awful as the first we ended up paying another 40 to upgrade to a suite - the bar stopped serving at midnight (so did not meet with the definition of a 4 star hotel which states food and drink available 24 hours).Oh, and the next morning only lukewarm water so no bath or shower.Lastminute tell me they rely on the hotel to provide the star rating so beware - do some research of your own before you book."
110,657,"Oct 11 2004	My Stay at the Commodore	My wife and I stayed at the Commodore Hotel from Oct. 3-9, 2004. Here are my humble opinions and observations:GOOD: Nice location across from Hyde Park and on the Central Tube Line. Well situated off the main drag on a quiet street. Decent breakfast included and an optional English breakfast available for a fee. Nice little bar in the hotel. Also, I read the other reviews that mentioned the narrow hallways and small lift. These observations are true, but I've been on smaller lifts in Europe. It is still better than climbing the stairs. The hallways are at least wide enough to negotiate with luggage. This place is decent for the cost. London is expensive, after all, so you can't think in US terms as far as what you get for the price paid.NOT SO GOOD: Man, I'll tell you, if you are even close to being a light sleeper, you won't get much sleep in this hotel. Every conversation in adjoining rooms and in the hall could be heard clearly. Normal walking in the hall on our floor or on the floor above us sounded like stomping due to the rickety floors. The inevitable door slammer on your floor will wake you even if you are a sound sleeper. The real clincher was the hotel staff vacuuming the hall carpets at 8am every morning. In short, I've been in plenty of hotels in my life, and the noise factor is higher than average in this hotel. Also, the bed was the hardest I've ever slept on. If you are like Tom Hanks in Castaway and are used to sleeping on the ground, this bed will be OK for you. Otherwise, you may be tossing and turning alot. The shower had good pressure, but I got a lot of hot to cold to hot again.In closing, like most things in life, the Commodore has some good and some bad. I'll probably try another place if I go back to London, but this hotel is not a bad option overall. Cheers!"
111,657,"Jun 21 2004	For some Buckingham Palace wouldn't be good enough	My trip to London was terrific thanks to the staff and the lovely Commodore Hotel. The room was very clean (almost spotless), the bed was very comfortable, but a bit too short since I'm 6'3&quot;, but that wasn't even a problem; the bathroom was terrific. The room had a safe, TV and instruments to make coffee, which was supplied. Over all the room was perfect for one person. Yes, it could have been bigger, but I wasn't planning on spending long hours in my room. YOU'RE ON VACATION, SLEEP, SHOWER THEN GET OUT OF YOUR ROOM. Oh, had an amazing view of the 'OLD' church/apartment - beautiful. The daily breakfast (which is included) was excellent as well as the staff. Workout room is small, but perfectly fine for excercising. Tube is very close, as well as the park, which had people selling beautiful art on the weekends.Listen, I've stayed at the Lanesborough, Hempel and other hotels which were terrific, but for the money and service, this is a great hotel. For those individuals who want to cry about the hotel, call the Queen and see if she'll let you stay for a couple of days, since you're obviously not satisfied with anything. P.S. If she lets you stay at the Palace, ask her what's in those purses."
112,657,"Jun 15 2004	It's a good hotel for the money	My 3 friends, I and my son had a good stay at the Commodore Hotel at end of May.. We can say only good things about the hotel, staff and service--friendly, efficient, helpful!! Our stay was 6 nights. The location was perfect for our needs, Hyde park only 2 min walk from hotel and this area was simply a quiet, safe, peaceful place to stay. Inna"
113,657,"Jun 3 2004	Great hotel 	Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Commodore hotel in May '04 and we had a wonderful time there. Got a pretty good deal from laterooms website (69 pounds double room per night all taxes/breakfast included). Location is very good, about 5 min walk from Lancaster tube station. Also 10 min walk to Paddington station (many trains depart from here, also the Heathrow express). Very quiet neighborhood. We were very pleasantly surprised with how well the entire hotel is decorated in its Victorian settings (pictures of the Queen Victoria everywhere). Our room was on the 6th floor, despite the small yet function lift and narrow hallways, the room was comfortable yet typical small for london standards. Room was a bit stuffy since no A/C and some oil exhaust from the kitchen would rise up around dinner time. Bed was very good, cable tv and wonderful antique style decor. Bathroom amazing as well. Breakfast was in self serve buffet cold foods with cooked breakfast @ additional charge. They also have a pre-arranged taxi service that will pick you up directly from the hotel to take you to Heathrow for 30 pounds flat rate (great for 2 or more people, since the Heathrow Express is only slightly cheaper and departs from Paddington station). Overall a very nice place and we would stay here again."
114,657,"May 14 2004	Hotel with character	I can't believe some of the negative comments about this hotel. I've stayed three times now and it is full of character. Set in a quiet square just five minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station, the place has a wonderful charm and ambience. It is clean, the staff are pleasant. OK, the corridors to the rooms are quite narrow, and the lift is small, but the rooms I stayed in were large, well-appointed, clean, and very comfortable. Breakfasts were above average, and for an extra 7.50 the cooked English breakfast - made to order - beats any of the usual self-service fare kept under hot plates in some other hotels! I have always got a good rate from using the Internet and will stay there again."
115,657,"Apr 28 2004	Cheap 	I booked the hotel because of the cheap rate (59 GBP for double room incl. tax and breakfast) and the 4*, but the hotel was a bit disappointing: very small room, poor breakfast, but friendly staff and quiet area, good location. The year before i stayed in St. Giles (near British museum). Altough it was a 3*, the rooms were bigger and beter furnished, but breakfast was self service."
116,657,"Apr 23 2004	Do not stay here	DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES STAY HERE! I booked the hotel under the impression it was a 4* hotel...but i wudnt even give it 2. the bed was uncomfortable, and tiny, you could hardly sit on the couch, the tv channels were in german. the room looked dirty, as did the fake marble-looking bathroom. the corridors and the lift are a JOKE as to how small they are. the only good thing about this hotel is that it has a 11oclock check out that can be extended to 12oclock. for the amount i paid for it...i was bitterly disappointed. ive stayed in many a hotel, and many a 4*hotel as well...however, this hotel, i would NEVER stay in again under ANY circumstances."
117,657,"Mar 30 2004	Not terrible	Stayed here on the last night of our European adventure. The hallways and elevator are cartoonishly small, however the room was a very comfortable size (much larger than the rooms at the Holiday Inn, where we stayed earlier in our trip). The bathrooms was beautiful with the exception of the shower curtain, which had a bit of rust at the bottom. My only compliant was with the bedding. The pillows and mattress made me feel as though I was sleeping on a giant marshmallow. If you can handle the squishy bedding, you can't beat the price and location."
118,657,"Mar 26 2004	Four star hotel I think not	Do not stay at this hotel. I came with high hopes after viewing pictures of this hotel on the internet. The supposed luxury accomodations etc. I was sorely dissapointed. We stayed in a double standard, which was roomy, with a nice bathroom. The good things end there. The customer service was horrible, especially the receptionist at the front desk, who barely gave us directions to our own room after plopping the keys down in front of us. Our beds were not made, we had to call for towels and blankets several times before they even came. The internet service was not working - and that also took several calls. Prompt service was not a priority for these people. The supposed hotwater maker was rusty and disgusting, the curtain in the shower had a mildew ring. The room was musty and the people who work at this hotel have one thing on their mind: getting money from the customer. The towels in the bathroom looked like they had been in a fight with a tazmanian devil. There is no such thing as genuine, hearfelt customer service here. It's all about hustling a buck. A terrible hotel with staff who could care less about your well being as long as you spend your money on the highly overpriced minibar and $15.00 internet access."
119,657,"Mar 8 2004	Would never stay there again!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel in February of '04. The room was small and COLD with no way to regulate the heat. The housekeeping was minimal. The worst, tho, was the shower which burned us each morning as the &quot;mixer&quot; for cold water didn't work. We complained several times but nothing was done. We spoke to the General Manager and the desk clerk about a rate reduction the night before we checked out, which they agreed was reasonable. However when we went to check out the clerk denied all knowledge of the conversation and refused to summon the Manager or discuss a reduction, telling us to write a letter instead. This was the same fellow we had observed denying every guest request and having phone converstaions with irate previous guests. Would never stay here again!"
120,657,"Mar 3 2004	A Good Choice	I just stayed at the Commodore (Feb '04), and was very happy with my room and the hotel in general. It is conveniently located but tucked back in a quiet, leafy circle with little traffic. The room, halls, elevators, and public areas are mostly very small, which is to be expected in this price range in London. My room (504) was immaculate, the marble tiled bathroom perfect, and there was a lovely private patio with a table and two chairs overlooking the mews in back. The restaurant in the basement looks recently refurbished. There are many low and moderate-priced hotels in this part of London. I'd go back in an instant, especially to this room."
121,657,"Feb 28 2004	Enjoyed the Commodore Hotel	We stayed at the Commodore Hotel, 50 Lancaster Gate, London, England for four nights. With all the sights to see, we did not hang around the hotel during the day, we only slept there and enjoyed the breakfast that came with the cost of the room. We paid $124 a night and tax and service fees were not included, so there was an additional $100 added on. Lodging is expensive in London. The room was comfortable. The only problem we had was on the last day when we were left with one towel between the two of us, the housekeeper did not finish making the bed and did not resupply the tea service and we were charged for the mini bar when we did not use it. These little things did not bother us and were dealt with easily. The front desk people were very friendly and helpful. We were able to store our bags for no extra cost at the hotel since we arrived early in the morning and our room would not be available until 2:00 p.m. The breakfast was wonderful, an assortment of cereal, buns, cheese, yogurt, juice and fruit, and the location of the hotel is great especially if you like to walk or run in the morning - the entrance to Hyde park is just across the street. Also, the Tube (we found to be the most efficient way to get around and the seven day pass is the cheapest fare even if you are only staying four days) is just a few blocks walk. There are also bus stops very close by. I would stay there again."
122,657,"Feb 15 2004	Great Hotel in my book!	I was very pleased by the Commodore Hotel. I have stayed in cheap London hotels before, and the Commodore was very nice in every respect. The rooms were the biggest I've had in London (though I always stay in cheap places) and the beds were very comfortable. Even the bathroom was big, for an English hotel bathroom. It was all marble and very nice. I was also thrilled to see that my double room also had a sofa! I've never gotten more than a utilitarian desk with my bed... but this room had a nice desk, a decent bed with good linen, and a sofa. For 69# a night, I was extremely satisfied. The tube station is nearby, and the bus station is even closer."
123,657,"Jan 29 2004	A great place to stay	My husband and I just returned from London (Jan, 2004) and had the pleasure of staying at The Commodore. The room (an executive double (?) on the ground floor) was very clean though fairly small by American standards. Just a note- the hallways are small but you won't have to climb stairs. There is an elevator to all floors. The large wardrobe had plenty of room to stash our things, and we appreciated the programable safe. They also provided and electric kettle and tea/coffee supplies. There was enough room on top of the wardrobe to stow our two large suitcases which freed up floor space. The room also had a desk (with a hairdryer in the drawer) and chair. The high ceilings made the small room seem a bit bigger. The draperies and lovely chandelier were elegant touches.  The bed (two twins put together to make a king) was firm but comfortable. There were four large, high quality down pillows and a synthetic comforter with a duvet. All in all, it was one of the better hotel beds I've slept on. The bathroom was spotlessly clean-very modern with cultured marble walls and chrome fixtures.  The price of the room included a continental breakfast served downstairs in the restaurant. It featured 6 types of cold cereal, milk, orange and apple juice, yogurt, ham, cheese, croissants, bread, an assortment of jams, and fresh fruit served with tea or coffee. A full english breakfast of eggs, bacon, tomatoes, and baked beans could be purchased for an additional 7.50 pounds. The wait staff was very pleasant. The food was always fresh and attractively presented-far more than I can say for some American hotels I have visited.  The location of the hotel was perfect for sightseeing in London. It was a 5 pound cab ride from the Heathrow Express at Paddington station, 5 minutes walk from the Lancaster Gate tube station, and about 3 minutes from the nearest bus stop (both city buses and tour buses stop there). There was a lovely 300 year old pub, The Swan, just a couple of minutes walk away on Bayswater. The hotel itself is located about a block from Hyde park. The park is easily accessed through Lancaster Gate. The area itself is very quiet and we felt quite safe walking at night. We traveled all over the city and found the location very convenient.  Okay, here are the complaints. Mind you, these are very trivial but I wanted to include everything. The hotel room keys are HUGE. They're attached to a billiard ball type thing and it added to the weight in my backpack. The heated towel rack in the bathroom didn't work until our last day there (it would have been nice to have it operating as it was cold outside). There were only two towels in the bathroom. I'm sure we could have asked for more. There were very few channels on the television. We were out most of the time, but when we did want to watch TV, we had about 4 things to choose from and two of them were news. Also, buy a phone card if you plan to make any phone calls (local or long distance). Their phone rates were very high.  I know I've gone on forever, but I would have appreciated more details when I was looking for a hotel. The hotel staff was very helpful, the room was nice, and the location was good. I would definately recommend The Commodore."

1,660,"Nov 20 2009 	DISGUSTING HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE	The room smelled like smelly mens feet and everything about the room was dirty and grotty.At night the room was freezing cold and the spare blankets smelled so bad I resorted to sleeping in my clothes.. scarf and hat included. When showering as there was no fan in the ensuite ( where mould grew on the ceiling and walls and pieces were falling from the shabby ceiling tiles), the fire alarm went off...following which the guy from reception pounded on the door. Walking the streets all night would have been a better experience. NEVER AGAIN."
2,660,Sep 14 2009 	Horrible horrible horrible...I even left and stayed at another hotel!	I booked to stay at the Corbigoe as it was cheap and in a nice area.When I arrived the atmosphere was not very welcoming and we went up to our room and it wasn't even clean from the previous guests!! We complained and left to stay at the guest house on the opposite side of the road.
3,660,"Aug 22 2009 	A Terrible Experience!	This hotel is such a shame that is worse than the shelter! Once I got into the room, everything was terrible. First of all, the pillows were terribly dirty and they just used a blanket to cover it (they wouldn't change the blanket till you checked out) . Besides, the television was very small in and it was impossible to watch BBC One since I believed the signal was interfered. Also, I can tell you the most terrible thing that caused my mum sick was the toilet had never been cleaned and the towel had never been changed as well. I really couldn't believe it because cleaning the toilet and changing the towel are really important in a hotel as we take a bath or shower everyday. Since they call themselves as a hotel, I believed the breakfast would be a traditional English breakfast, however, the breakfast was just a few pieces of bread, coffee and tea, which was kept in an old tin. Furthermore, the 'hotel' was far away from the Victoria station as I spent about 15 minutes to walk to the hotel from the station and I found that the nearest station is Pimlico station, which took me a few minutes to walk to there. Finally, please do not trust the information from their own website because I was cheated by their description!Good luck."
4,660,May 17 2009 	Should be Shut Down by London Tourist Board!	What a Nightmare!This place is disgusting and should be shut down by the London Tourist Board. Mattresses had stains all over and springs were popping through. When we complained the manager suggested we stack the mattresses. Mold in the bathroom and none of the electrical outlets worked. Bathroom had a dangerously high step up and the door did not close in the opening. The toilet paper holder and toilet seat were broken and everything was filthy.The single closet was falling apart and almost fell over when we opened the door. The room was filthy and carpets were disgusting with the blanket being much the same. The windows did not shut and as we were just below the street level which compromised our security. The staff was rude and uncompromising and the continental breakfast which we did not eat was still left out unprotected by the end of the day when we returned to collect our bags to move to another hotel. Don't let anything convince you to stay at this Dive. Its just not worth it and is guaranteed to ruin your London trip which it would have done for us had we not left after one sleepless night.
5,660,"Mar 22 2009 	Vile!	Stayed here ages ago but I think everyone needs to know how rubbish it is!!This hotel was disgusting! We went to London for 2 nights, hoping for a safe, clean place to stay. We originally booked the Park Hotel, further down the road, but we got moved to the Corbigoe Hotel as the room in the other one was 'poorly'!. Our room was right on the top floor and we were horrified at the state of it (and we aren't even fussy!). The carpets were filthy and the bed sheets had some very suspicious stains on them! the best of all though has to be the shower! it was broken and was held up with an old, sweaty UMBRO SOCK! the chain on the toilet wouldn't flush! we didn't dare get in the bed sheets and wore flip flops in the bathroom at all times! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! The only positive thing I have to say about it is good location...but I'd rather stay somewhere miles away than in this hell hole!!!"
6,660,"Mar 3 2009 	Cheap hotel	We had read reviews just before our trip, that this is a hellhole. So our expectations were very low, and we had desided to check the first night and change if it really is that bad. We had a 6,5 months years old baby with us. For the price and location, this was very good hotel. Of course, there very flaws, only one towel (we asked the next day and got 2 more), the heating was on only by night, but that was when it was needed so no problem.No real blanket, but the system of sheet and dayblanket was good enough, and I think that was how it was mentioned to be.The biggest flaw was the shower. We were it topfloor, and waterpressure was, well,non-existent at that altitude. So showering was a bit hard.For budget traveller, this was very good. Shops and restaurants nearby, 100 meters on Pimlico Underground, about 1 km to Victoria. And the inner city sightseeings in walking distance."
7,660,"Feb 28 2009 	Never again	We booked a 3 night stay here for my birthday. My first time staying in London. The room we got was right next to reception. Very noisy. The bathroom needed a ladder to get in to it, if you dared go in. Mould was growing everywhere. No towels were provided and when we asked were told they were out of clean ones. We bought our own in markets. At least we knew they were clean. The window was held in with screws. The noise from reception was terrible. The staff were rude. We didn't stay for breakfast any morning. Didn't want to chance it. Would rather sleep on streets than stay here again."
8,660,"Nov 12 2008 	Never write reviews but...	Very dirty, &quot;newly refurnished&quot; in early 60ties (see the 1970 warranty in the reception of being a member in some hotel group) and necessary repairs in the way like: damaged case-door hinge repaired that the door is screwed to the shelf and you can not open it. Sharp rest of off-knocked soap holder in the shower, faded and ragged drapery on bed, moulded corners in shower basin, plugged washing basin, shower etc. I realised they do no vacuum cleaning during your stay - only think they do is that they &quot;somehow&quot; make your bed and desinficise WC. During my stay the heating was off, I experienced very cold nights, especially beware - there are no quilts, only a linen and bed spreads (not well thermo-isolating, dirty, of course).You are strictly asked to check out already at 10:30, however when I arrived just before 13:00, the &quot;large&quot; (as the receptionist said) room was not made yet. It was a double room those size and equipment I would compare to a prison cell (2,5x 4 m including bathroom), no table, no chair.The second day when I returned, the room door stayed opened, however I locked it in the morning. And what more - the receptionist gave me another key - so I also could enter another room.Also interesting was the fact, that leaving luggage in the hotel (I do not write in reception, on purpose) is charged 1 GPB per piece (I have never seen such charges, it was always free). In fact the luggage was in the breakfast room where other guests could enter.Really terrible experience, I would not believe that for two nights you can after monday night reduction pay 99 GBP."
9,660,"Sep 23 2008 	Bit of a shocker	We arrived at Corbigoe, around 11.00am after a 30 hour flight, really just wanting to put our heads down for a catch up sleep Wow room was not ready, asked to come back at 3.00pm left bags and walked around London . 7 flights steps no lift no help. Shown twin room, sheets clean, bathroom very shabby, shower mouldy not working, had to ask for help. Noise from TV and neighbours next door all night. A coat of paint would lift the atmosphere throughout. All the Traveller wants is clean, tidy room available on arrival, and a decent breakfast .Juice, Cornflakes, milk, make your own white bread toast, butter and jam. Coffee and Tea was providedCome on Corbigoe London smarten up your act, other B/Bs in England, Scotland, Germany and France are so far ahead with service to the traveller."
10,660,"Sep 2 2008 	Do not stay here if you value your life!!!	We originally booked in at The Park hotel (owned by the same people who own The Corbigoe). However when we were given the rooms (on the top floor - no lift, 10 flights of stairs) we were disgusted at what we saw. The rooms had not been made up and were filthy. The beds were dirty, the bins were over flowing with food. The bathroom - well don't ask. I immediately went downstairs and requested a refund (we had to pay as soon as we entered the building). The guy said he understood why we did not want to stay there but wanted to take us to a better hotel, with bigger rooms and a nicer shower. Foolishly we agreed and were taken to The Corbigoe.From the outside, these hotels look beautiful - however the inside leaves a lot to be desired. I think that because of the original memory of The Park, we conceded that the rooms at The Corbigoe were better - however the truth is, they were not! I have uploaded photos of the bathroom because I believe people should see what they could encounter if they chose to stay there.We were given two rooms - a twin room and a room big enough for three of us. My room was not ready when we were taken there but was assured that it would be cleaned before I came back after sight seeing.I wouldn't put my worst enemy in this room. The beds were uncomfortable with very dirty sheets. Not sure if we imagined it, but we itched all night long. The window was broken so would not close, making it cold and noisy in our room. The person next door to us, clearly could not use a key and decided to kick his bedroom door open at night. This terrified us (I was with two children). At any time of day, we could make our way down the several flights of stairs and find dirty bed linen on the floor - still there several hours later. A vacuum was also left in the landing, possibly for show as I refuse to accept that it is ever used!The bathroom was so filthy we were considering not washing during our stay. The mould and pure filth was extensive in the bathroom. I can barely believe we came out alive! There was no hot water for the shower after early morning and we used bottled water to brush our teeth due to the dirt on the sink taps. The toilet was deeply stained with a brown substance - that was just lazy cleaning staff - no excuse for such awful standards. We did not pull the shower curtain around us, for fear it might touch us - yuk!! The bathroom smelled and this obviously drafted into our sleeping area. The handles on the wardrobe and cupboard were broken and there was such dust inside that you would never hang your clothes up anyway. The breakfast described as continental was just toast and jam. But to be fair, had they served up anything more, it would go uneaten as you can just imagine the environment where it may be cooked. The reception is advertised as 24 hour, however this appears to be shared between the two hotels. We came back from a trip to the theatre at midnight and could not get in. Eventually a man came carrying keys to let us in, but it took him a further 15 minutes to locate the right key and get us into the hell hole.I am not passive in any way and complained repeatedly to the manager, however this fell on deaf ears. We found the staff to be rude and ignorant and unhelpful. I am aware that it is a budget hotel and as such did not expect plush surroundings, but a basic standard of hygiene should always been maintained and here it was not. It would be better and cleaner to sleep in the tube station. We will never return and will put this review on every travel website to disuade people from having to endure the same kind of discomfort that we did."
11,660,"Jul 17 2008	The Corbigoe Hotel	Having read the reviews about the Corbigoe hotel on this site only shortly before our stay which we had booked months ago and not being able to cancel the booking at such short notice we were prepared to face hell's teeth when we arrived at the Corbigoe, but were pleasantly surprised. We had booked a triple room and were given a room for five persons in the basement. In relation to the price (if you buy cheap you get cheap) the room was clean and OK. It is true that the breakfast (tea/coffee, toast and jam) is nothing to write home about but that is not the most important thing in a hotel, is it? The staff were very kind and helpful and all in all we had a pleasant stay at that hotel. The Victoria line gave great access to the city centre."
12,660,Jul 16 2008 	NO WAY	Stayed 1 night in Corbigoe in a Barbie-room.We were given a tiny room that hardly fitted the double bed and the cupboard. Shower was like in a cupboard. Imagine: we were 2 people and had to take turns as only 1 person could be standing in the &quot;room&quot;. Bathroom was outside the room!Very disappointing experience. Spoiled our first day in London.
13,660,"May 29 2008 	most horrible place	we recently stayed at this hotel for a 2 night stay, originally we were meant to stay at the park hotel the man on reception said he would take us to another hotel just down the road with better rooms as we got kids. upon checking in the first turn off was we were on the second storey up 4 flights of stairs. the room had a double bed and a bunk its smelled really bad outside the room inside was small the bathroon was dirty and grimey and smelled, the beds were hard and had vile bed linens on the windows were dirty we kept expecting something to crawl out from under the bed it was the worst 2 nights of our lives my kids were miserable they promised cable tv/internet where was that we had 2 channels, the kitchen was vile we did not eat there we bought flip flops just so we could have a shower and towels and bedding to sleep on it was a cesspool not fit for human inhabitants and thars putting it mildly i wouldnt put a animal there nevermind people.....if this was a better hotel i'd hate to see the park. Please fellow travellers check trip advisors before booking a hotels i'm afraid i didnt and this resulted in the worst experience for me and my family."
14,660,"May 18 2008 	Don't go there	We were 8 adults from Denmark staying there for 4 nights. We had booked 4 dbl. rooms 6 months in advance, but on the day of arrival we were put into a 4 bed room, two 3 bed rooms and a doubble room. We were asked to change rooms for the next day and then back again the following day.The rooms (floor, shelves) were dirty and in the bathroom there were mould fungis all over.Breakfast was, if you like toast and jam, all right, but no good service at all.Don't expect to get new or dry towels when needed. Sorry to say, but the worst hotel we have ever stayed at."
15,660,"May 14 2008 	Run While You Still Can	If I could give this place no stars, I would. The staff is nice, but the hotel room was dirty especially the shower and I had problems with the toilet flushing, but I think that might be all over London. I had to &quot;tippy toe&quot; in the shower because the floor of the shower was so horribly filthy. Nothing was done about it until my last day at the hotel. Also, I came in on a day that it was snowing and the hotel had no heat. At least, the hotel clerk gave me a portable heater, but I still managed to get sick. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
16,660,"Mar 6 2008 	Hell Hole	This has got to be the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. It was a last minute booking so we didn't have time to check it out first. It's hard knowing where to start but I think the most shocking thing for me was the boarded up fire exit which I'm sure can't be legal or in any way in line with health and safety regulations. Also, I remember the stair carpet not lying correctly so you could easily trip and fall down the stairs. We were given a twin room and both of the beds had sheets and pillows that had stains not just on one side but on both sides and at both ends of the beds suggesting that they had turned the sheets over several times rather than washing them. I was just glad we were only staying for 1 night and couldn't wait to go out and come back drunk so that I wouldn't care so much about the appauling room. We weren't brave enough to stay for breakfast. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL - IT NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN! It truly is a health and saftey risk and so please don't risk it - just read the previous reviews."
17,660,"Feb 27 2008 	Better than other reviews say	I was originally booked into the Park hotel (same owners and same road) but was told on check in that the bed was 'a little bit broken' and so I was taken down the road and checked in at the Corbigoe. Having read reviews for the Park I was surprised that my room, although small was clean and comfortable. The en suite was small admittedly but perfectly adequate, and looked as if it had been retiled fairly recently. The room I ended up in was actually a triple (double + single beds) so was plenty big enough for a lone traveller. It was on the 4th floor, which is a lot of steps but they can't exactly make the floors closer together. The tv worked fine, although it hadn't been tuned properly (soon fixed). Its on quite a busy road but with the windows closed it was fine. My only particular gripe was that there was no milk for the tea and coffee in the room.This place i fine if you need somewhere to stay for a couple of nights while in London (either sight seeing or for work) but not a luxuary place for a special trip but you can't expect that for 30 a night in central London."
18,660,Feb 12 2008	go somewhere else	scary..very dirty..smells..do not do it..very nice people though!
19,660,"Jan 12 2008 	do not use this hotel	please do not use this hotel. It was horrible. The bed was clean and comfortable, the room was warm and the breakfast coffee was ok but everything else was awful. Everything was shabby dirty creaky. The cleaner I dont think had ever cleaned the windows in our room as, when I rubbed the condensation away cos it was raining, dirt ran down the window. We were just leaving then thank goodness. The window frame was filthy, the bathroom sink was awful and the loo needed a gallon of bleach down it. . The only reason we stayed (2 nights) was because we had never intended spending any time there apart from sleeping and thought we could put up with it. The shower was the worst thing. I could not bear to use it. The shower tray was held in place with so much sealant you would not believe and where there was no sealant there was black mould. Breakfast I suppose was ok if you like cornflakes, rice crispies and plastic white toast and jam. (As much as you want though I have to say)I often think that when you are out and about on a city break, the hotel doesnt matter much as all you do is sleep and wash in it. But next time I will trade up..no doubt about it. There were mostly foreign guest there, Italian, Spanish etc. I was ashamed because we have stayed in cheap hotels in lots of European cities and all bar none have been great."
20,660,"Nov 30 2007 	Foul	Run by the same people who run the Park hotel. I was due to stay in Carbigoe but was moved to the park because the boiler was broken (although my colleague was never moved). Absolutely disgusting, nothing had been cleaned in weeks, there was a thick layer of dust everywhere and the portaloo they claimed was an en-suite smelled so bad I couldn't bear to brush my teeth in there. Please don't stay, unless you want fleas."
21,660,Oct 29 2007 	Forgot for it	Save Your money for another hotel. Belgrave Road is full of small hotels which are better than Corbigoe Hotel. They lost our reservation which was before confirmed by theyr sales manager. All negativ comments on Tripadvisor are TRUE.Tomas
22,660,"Sep 23 2007 	Worse Nightmare - Carbigoe Hotel	Carbigoe Hotel, 101 Belgrave Road , London.When we arrived at this hotel and saw the accommodations, we were absolutely shocked! First we had to climb 87 (!) steps to get to our room! Then the room was tiny, smelly, the lock on door was broken, bathroom was absolutely disgusting, sheets were stained, mold everywhere. We immediately checked out, but the hotel manager had the nerve to charge us two night stay! We didn't care, as there was no way we would spend even one night in this hell hole! It is horrible!"
23,660,"Jun 27 2007 	Much better than expected	We had read some really bad reviews about this place but decided to book anyhow as it is a great price for the location in London. We were pleasantly surprised, the hotel was in a great location with two tube stops close by, the staff were very friendly too. Rooms were very small, however clean, breakfast was not fancy but ample. Would definately stay here next time we come to London."
24,660,"Jun 18 2007	Not a fantastic experience	Myself and 3 guys went to London for 3 days and as we are students, we wanted a cheap hotel. The Corbigoe looked ok on the website and seemed a reasonable price. It is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. My room was very near to reception and all I could hear was the owner's mobile going off at 2 am and people going to their rooms, as the walls were paper thin. My supposed en-suite room had the toilet along the corridoor and lots of people used it which meant it was dirty. The so called continental breakfast consisted of cornflakes and toast - not a huge selection. Overall the place needed a good clean and more towels!! The only plus point was the location - very near to Pimlico station and not too far from Victoria. I would not return again, and would certainly not reccommend the corbigoe to a woman travelling alone."
25,660,May 4 2007 	close it down	We stayed in this hotel on 22th September and I wish I could never stay there... the worst experience of my life... don't book this hotel and force them to close down...
26,660,"Mar 13 2007	a moist intriguing experience	Well, you get what you pay for- in our case a 2,5x2,5 m2 room, with a tiny tv and a foul smell. Our towels didn't dry in the four days we stayed there, the kettle was broken and there was mildew in the shower. The walls are paper thin- you hear every move your (horny in our case) neighbour does. Eat breakfast somewhere else. Seriously. Just around the corner a sweet spanish man makes you a delicious breakfast and good coffee.Use Pimlico underground station, much closer than Victoria.The toilet is in the hallway- and don't be surprised if someone left you a present- the toilet flushes poorly.But the staff is not too bad."
27,660,"Jan 7 2007 	Stay away!	Corbigoe is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I planned a trip to London for New Year's and while looking for a budget hotel I came across the Corbigoe website. Happy to see that there was a website and that there was an online booking discount offer, I called the hotel to ask a few questions, got them answered in a relatively professional manner, and went ahead to make my reservation online.I arrived in London and took the tube to the station Corbigoe recommended on their website. Big mistake. If after reading all these reviews you still plan to book with them, take the underground to Pimlico (2 blocks away), NOT to Victoria. After a long and convoluted walk I found the hotel. I was hoping to get in the room, shower, and sleep for a few hours. My friend who was staying with me was arriving later that day.At the receptionI was told that the room wasn't ready for another 3 hours...The guy at the reception told me however that I had to pay for everything now. Not being used to paying upfront, and not having enough cash, I was dismayed but gave him my credit card. He told me that there is a three-pound surcharge for using a card, and as I realized later, an awful exchange rate.He told me I could leave my suitcase in the room and come back in a few hours. I walked into the room and was overcome by disappointment, fear, and a desire to run away! The room was tiny, untidy and dirty. I thought that they probably hadn't cleaned it yet since the previous customers checked out. I left the hotel, and returned after about 2 hours, which I thought was ample time for them to get it cleaned, since they knew I had arrived already. When I came back the room was still unavailable, but the man rushed the maid to wrap up the cleaning so that I could use the room. As a result they forgot to leave any toilet paper or soap.I took a nap and thought that after I wake up everything will seem better. After I woke up, things were even worse. There was serious mold on the walls. The carpet was still dirty (I found jelly beans on the floor). The drawers were dirty and sticky. There was a thick layer of dust on the closet. The bathroom ceiling leaked every time someone upstairs showered. One of the wall lamps had no bulb and was broken.Given that there are no phones in the rooms, I wasn't sure how they would let me know that my friend had arrived. But he had no difficulty finding the room. Apparently, he gave the receptionist my name and they told him the room # and let him in without asking any other questions (not even his name) and without letting me know that someone was here to see me. During the 6 days we stayed the room was never cleaned, the (two) towels never changed, and the bed was made once.When I checked out there were two men in the reception. I returned the key and told them I'm checking out. They said &quot;OK&quot;. I also gave them 3 umbrellas that I had to buy for the rain, and told them that they could give them out to other customers when they need them (I needed one the first night, and was told that they didn't have any). They took them and remained silent. I stood there for a minute or so, waiting for the courtesy &quot;thank you for staying with us&quot; or &quot;we hope you enjoyed your stay&quot;, but all I got were looks of &quot;ok, you're done&quot;. At that moment all I could do was smile and be happy that I was out of there.Had I not paid in advance, and were it not a busy time of the year, I would have left from day 1. I was looking forward to writing this review to prevent others from ruining their vacation. I am not really fussy about where I stay, but at Corbigoe I was counting down the days for my vacation to be over."
28,660,"Dec 18 2006	ok	We expected a cheap hotel with low standard and that is what it was. The linen was clean, the bathroom got cleaner during our stay... but it was cold and unwelcoming.Some small changes could make it to a nice place. For example if the men/owners(?) were nicer! If there was a welcome board on the inside of the roomdoors, Telling:&quot; welcome to carbigoe hotel. We hope you will have a pleasent stay &quot;...so on and at last &quot; please note our breakfast time, our checkingout time...&quot; etc.There was one time for breakfast at the reception and one at the breakfastroomdoor.We had to ask for towels, toiletpaper etc. We didn't bother to ask for soap, we used our schampoo.otherwise it was worth the price we payed."
29,660,"Nov 26 2006	Should Be Closed Down	Neve assume that London has hotels to offer if you just turn up without having made any plans. Otherwise you end up staying at the bottom of the barrell in the likes of the Corbigoe hotel! The staff have no attention to detail and just seem to be plain lazy. The place looks like it was set up 30 years ago and hasn't had a touch up since. They overbook you into their hotel and then send other customers down to their other flea pit, the the Rama. We sussed this out when speaking to two other guests. The hotel does not have rating and the experience which I had has taught me never to come to London under prepared."
30,660,"Sep 25 2006 	Its not worth a rating it was worse than terrible	My husband organised a cheap break for us for our 5 year wedding anniversary for two nights, Im generaly not to fussy about staying in a one star hotel providing its clean. When we arrived the staff members were reasonably helpful, they gave us keys to our room which was one level down from reception and requested confirmation as to whether or not we wanted breakfast, we said we did and paid an extra 5 each for the two mornings.When we opened the door to our room we were welcomed by an awful stench (it smelt like a cat had urinated in it). The ceiling was stained from leaking water (this started dripping throughtout the second night when we had rain) there were two double beds that smelt musty and a single towl for us to share placed on one of the beds, and half of the plug socket was smashed with wires exposed.The bathroom was disgusting, the tiles were dirty with mildew everywhere, both the sink and toilet were grimey , and only one toilet roll had been provided (I cant say I found the idea of having a shower very appealing) and again the wires were exposed on the light above the mirror.After our first nights stay, we had showers in the morning and placed the dirty towel on the floor, for them to replace. when we came back that evening the towel had been picked up, folded in half and placed at the end of the spare bed to dry.In order to get ready to leave, I stripped the bed (Im a bit daft like that) anyway, its then that I saw what state the pillows are in, it was disgusting they were extremely yellow!Breakfast - Yuk!!!we went to have our breakfast only to find that the glasses were stained and the tray where the Milk and Orange juice were placed was greasy and black, when you lifted up the jugs there was a shiney silver circle (the colour the tray was meant to be) where the tray had been protected from the jugs!On our second morning, they ran out of butter so I went looking for someone in the Kitchen to ask for some more, I was shocked at the mess and scum around the Kitchen, if I didnt have a strong stomach I would have been sick at the thought of where the bread etc was being stored.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. and think that Health and Saftey need to get involved.and they need to consider getting off their backsides, stop chinwagging on their mobiles and scrub the rooms before the next poor sucker walks through the door and gives them another bad review."
31,660,"Sep 19 2006 	TERRIBLE AWFUL DISGUSTING...(need I say more?)	Unusually I did not check the reviews on tripadvisor like I normally do before booking a hotel. I really wish I had now...The experience of my girlfriend and I was very much like those of so many people who have left reviews. On arrival we were told that the room they had reserved for us was not available as there was a 'problem', so they would be taking us to a nearby partner hotel - the Chester Hotel.'Taking us' actually meant that we had to walk quite some distance down the street with a member of the reception staff, who didn't offer any assistance, even though we had quite a few bags between us. We were then met by a member of staff from the other hotel.Had I not already paid for the room through hotels.com, I would have walked away as soon as I saw it. However, I did not see there being much chance of me getting my money back so we decided to brave the room for the night. The room was very small and was probably even too dirty for cockroaches to stay there. The fridge in the room did not work, the cups for us to drink tea from were covered in a healthy layer of dirt, which was actually not such an issue given that there was no tea, milk or sugar provided in the room (I eventually discovered that this was to be found in a tray outside of reception in the basement, not that I would ever have taken the risk of consuming anything from those cups) and various wires covered the floor in front of the bathroom door as the TV was some distance from the aerial socket, meaning a trip or fall was a possible occurence. Two double beds (but only 1 towel in total!) were provided in the room for our use. This was fortunate as it allowed my girlfriend and I to choose the option with the least unidentified hairs on the pillow/under the duvet. I am sure that the carpet would have proven itself to be more than a match for Mr Dyson's greatest inventions. It was very much a place where you allowed skin to make contact with any surface at your peril! My opinion of the hotel was cemented when I visited reception at 9am to return my key and check-out. After knocking on the door marked reception twice, I was met by a man dressed only in boxer shorts who just managed to grunt a thank you as he took my key. This demonstrated the level of (un-)professional service provided by the hotel. At this time, one of the two entrances to the hotel was wide open: we were very pleased to see that security was so high on the list of priorities of the hotel management. Overall, I would never ever ever ever suggest that anyone use this hotel. Not only was it disgusting but the general level of security and safety provided by the hotel was a real concern. If you are thinking about taking a room here as it is the cheapest option in London, stop being such a spend-thrift, spend an extra 5-10 and go for one of the large budget chains such as Etap and enjoy the extra travelling time from central London, it is worth it!"
32,660,"Jul 2 2006	this hotel should be illegal!! i challange you to find a worse hotel in london!	When my dad and i first booked for our accomodation, we booked for the park hotel. It looked so nice and cosy on internet. On arrival we were informed that we would be staying at the corbigoe hotel instead of due to electrical faults! Also that we'd be moved to the park the next day, so we thought right, fine better than nothing, and at first the staff came across as friendly and helpful! i must have had a stressful day to think that! After checking in and mentioning that we'd booked two en-suite rooms, we got a double room each, no extra charge, how generous we thought!! ! we mentioned that we had booked 2 ensuite singles, and instead of an explanation or apology, we got a dirty look!! the tv in my room did not have a single channel that worked, the draws and wardarobe were unfit for use and had a funny musty smell, so badly that i had to wash my unworn clothes when i got home!! no ensuite facalities in the room except for a wash basin, bedsheets that smelt horrible and were stained, bed that looked threadbare, the carpet may as well not had been there! i looked forward to having in room tea and coffee facilitys, but after inspecting the cups, i wouldn't let a dying person drink out of one! the paint work needed redoing badly, carpets that looked like they hadn't been hoovered ever! scratches all over the bedside draws! the towels provided in room, was so disgusting i wouldn't dry my dog with one!! as for the rest of the hotel, all carpets were threadbare, the toilet smelt horrible, was tiny, and the door lock was about as much use as a chocolate fireguard! i tried to avoid using the toilet as much as possible, the subway toilets in westminster were like royalty-type compaired to this! the shower was so small, so dark,so dirty, i went without a shower for 3 days, i thought to myself, which would i rather do, smell or catch a disease!! the staff were inconsiderate, i had the misfortune of being in the room nearest to reception and had the pleasure of them shouting at the top of there voices at 5 in the morning! and no i didn't request a wake up call!! i looked forward to a nice breakfast and cup of tea! the tea tasted like it had been drained out the nearest sewer, the breakfast was cornflakes or toast, the cornflakes tasted like they were quite literally &quot;so last year&quot; one morning my dad and i sent the toast back!! we felt fortunate to be given jam to go with it! i am a lover of orange juice, there juice didn't taste of orange! so after all that we had to pay out for food on outings! the breakfast room was cold, un appealing, cramped, basic, and not to mention so uncomfortable that i would have been happier to sit on a park bench! if you want accomodation that is at least clean and provides a cup of tea, i wouldn't so much recommend this hotel for that!"
33,660,"Jun 19 2006	What a Dump	OH MY GOD - what a dump this place really is - we booked to stay in the Park Hotel and was ushered along the street to this hovel - unfortunaltely we had already paid or we would have told them where to go. We were on the top floor - window would not close all catches broken so very dangerous considering we were in a family room. The furniture was all broken/bare wires everywhere, it was called ensuite - what a cheek it was a stinking shower and toilet in what i can only call an airing cupboard. As we were only staying for one night we decided to make the best of it and went in search of a pub not to return until midnight. Considering how stinking/shabby everything looked we decided to pass on breakfast and checked out by 8.30am just to be out of there. So my advise to you is not to stay here - even on a budget you are being robbed as this place is surely a health hazard and should be closed down."
34,660,"Apr 30 2006	Corbigoe Hotel then...	I booked into this hotel primarily because this was the cheapest I could find in London and our New Zealand dollar (at that time) would only fetch 33 English pence. My wife and I are not fussy people when it comes to accommodation and with some foresight had an idea of what we may be getting ourselves into.We booked and stayed for 5 nights and although breakfast was included we did not eat there but preferred to make sandwiches in our room. Some issues about Corbigoe are listed below:1. Expect to be asked to pay your full accommodation costs at book in time.2. Staff are OK but not overly helpful3. No lift, If you are on the top floor you will need to negotiate some pretty tough stairways ( alright for those who like the exercise).4. Change of towels and bed linen are irregular.5 TV set will get 2 or 3 watchable channels6. Double room was adequate but ensuite toilet and shower required attention (mildew etc).On the plus side:Centrally located, close proximity to Pimlico station and local laundromat, Victoria Station about 1km away. (If you are concerned about the cost of &quot;eating out&quot; in Westminster City you can catch a local bus just outside, which will take you all the way to Campbell Town for cheap eating).Overall:As one reviewer pointed out, &quot;You pay for what you get&quot; My reason for flying half way around the world was to see London's sights and scenes on a budget. I used Corbigoe Hotel for the purpose of having a cheap place to rest my head each night. Although, I was far from enthused about Corbigoes service, it primarily suited my needs. Would I stay there again? Maybe, if Corbigoe can rectify its faults and upgrade its service (if not already) I cannot see why not."
35,660,"Mar 21 2006	Cheap means cheap	You definetly pay for what u get, when we arrived we were greeted by a tiny room, the room itself was clean and tidy, so was the bathroom apart from the shower which looked to have not been cleaned in weeks, we were disappointed with the breakfast which was small,(and the breakfast room was so cold you needed to wear a coat), definetlely not good enough for a days wlking around in London, for breakfast there was only cornflakes, tea, coffee(which was cold), and toast which you had to make yourself bearing in mind there were only 2 toasters for everyone, you even had to make your own tea, not the best organised in the world then when we were leaving we wanted to leave our luggage for the day and they charged us 1 pound per bag, I wont be staying there again."
36,660,"Mar 19 2006	Turned Out Great !!	After Reading all the scary reviews on this place(After being booked of course) We were freaked to say Just a Little. But not sure what anyone else &quot;really&quot; went though, BUT Our stay was Great. We were on the 1st floor and our room was very clean and Bigand it had it's own toliet/shower. The Bed and linens were clean and the were very polite and acommadating. It was cold and they offered and supplied extra covers and asked many times was everything was satisfactory.What a Pleasant stay it turned out to be.Thanks"
37,660,"Jan 23 2006	Stay at own risk!	This was the most disgusting hotel I've ever had the displeasure of staying in! The only thing clean in my room was me...and that was after walking around London for 8 hours! The bathroom was a biohazard, the sheets were dirty and the staff were completely useless. In terms of safety/security: at one point during our stay, some random guys with keys to our room just waltzed in while we were changing to go out (&quot;we&quot; being 3 females in their 20's). When confronted we were told by the staff that the workers were told to wait but just wandered up to our room anyway. Fair enough but...um...but how did they get a key?!?! Oh and breakfast was great...if you're into stale cornflakes and white Tesco bread with a toaster. Avoid this hotel like the plague...it's a waste of your money and likely a genuine health hazard."
38,660,"Nov 7 2005	Bad experience Do not consider this hotel	Hello,We booked a room at Park Hotel, 64 Belgrave Road in London. When we arrived, the receptionist told us that our room was to another hotel: the Corbigoe Hotel at the same street at number 101, close to Pimlico tube station.She told us: &quot;room number 15, a big room with bath&quot;We got the room on the top floor (4th),terrible dirty,disgusting and small!Receptionists were rude and disonest.We ask to keep our bags the last day and they ask us for 4punds, ok, when we take it bak they ask again for other 2 punds.That's the wrost experience I ever had.Please DO NOT consider these hotels: The Park and The Corbigoe. Disonests, dirty and rude service.Trust us, don't go there!!"
39,660,"Oct 14 2005	No charm - not too clean	We were warned by another tourist that cozy means small. When we opened the door to our room, our first view was of a wall. There was a long hall leading to our bed which was crammed into a corner. There was not enough room in the hallway for two of us. There was not enough room to place our luggage in the room except on the bed or in the aforementioned hallway. There was an amoire with mismatched and barely functional clothes hangers. The bathroom was o.k. - clean and with good water pressure but there was no bath mat, no face cloths and only two small towels. We had to ask for soap. There was a window that didn't lock. All drawers in the amoire and side table were dirty so we didn't use them. We had to pay for breakfast upon arrival - this was a suprise as we were under the impression it was included. The breakfast room was a bleak affair with a large bowl of cornflakes, some bread and coffee. I guess you get what you pay for. We stayed for three days because we had paid in advance and had little confidence that we would get our money back. We moved to Melbourne House on the same street. It was paradise."
40,660,"Sep 13 2005	Dirty!	Had a reservation att the Park Hotel on the same road (please see reviews about that Hotel before booking!), but was ushered to the Carbigoe instead.The room was tiny, dirty and smelly. Will absolutely never return to either of those hotels."
41,660,"Sep 7 2005	A nightmare	I wanted to cry when I arrived at the front door,so imagine what I found inside! It is the last time I choose a cheap B&amp;B by internet,I have learnt definitively."
42,660,"Jul 17 2005	DishonestRude 	It is totally below the lowest rating that can be made here with dishonest reception that does not provide the room according to what has been reserved but trying to offer discount to make the guest stay. When the trick does not work &amp; the guest cancel the stay, the dishonest hotel charge the total amount of full stay, rather than one night stay!!!!! Hope those who have the bad experiences with this hotel assist us to get back our tourist and consumer rights!"
43,660,Jul 1 2005	Possibly the worst hotel (or hole) in London	This might be the cheapest hotel in London but its definitly the worst. 24 hour reception involved a man in a sleeping bag asleep under the reception desk. If anyone complained the owners suddenly ceased to be able to speak English. The rooms were reasonalby clean although the furniture had no handles! We left too early to sample breakfast which was maybe a good thing! If you want the cheapest hotel in London this is for you but if you want any soft of standard of comfort look elsewhere!!
44,660,"Jun 20 2005	Heinous	I recently had the misfortune of spending 1 and  nights in the royal Carbigoe Hotel,the most disgusting condemnable rat hole I have EVER seen. I am a United States Marine currently vacationing with a friend from back home in Europe and I had thought from prior experiences in Iraq I had seen the worst. NEVER did I EVER expect to find a place of business let alone a Hotel in downtown London in such Heinous condition. If you continue on you may find humor or you may find disgust but this is the absolute truth about 2 gentlemen and how we paid to sleep under conditions you wouldnt find in the worst Compton Crack house. Honestly people it was so nasty it was funny, at least to a bunch of 22 year old travelers, families beware.We had just finished up a wonderful 5 days in Barcelona, full of fun in the sun, great food and awesome people en route to London where neither my friend nor myself had ever been. After squelching by on remedial Spanish we both looked forward to being able to utilize our English again, myself more than my friend as I have been living abroad in Geneva for over one year already without returning home to the states. We arrived in the late afternoon to 101 Belgrave road via Taxi from Victorias station which is fairly close by. The Carbigoe hotel was chosen in advance off of Expedia primarily because of its location and due to its reasonable price we had low expectations from the get go. As we entered our palace the first thing my friend and I realized was that this was not the same hotel we had seen pictured on their website, we wondered. Next we noticed a dingy smell of crud permeating through our nostrils complimented by the overbearing noise of an ensemble of hammers drills and screaming Arabian men. An Arab man wearing a polkadot butterfly collar shirt with goldrope necklace came around from the corner countertop and greeted us with a sly smile whilst we pulled out our Expedia confirmation.Preeminent dread filled my thoughts as the gentleman at the front desk proceeded to tell us we had to pay him and that our expedia reservation was just a reservation which required a fee in which he claimed he received nothing. Hmmm. Pretty pricey for a minimal service arrangement such as hotel accommodations. Of course being the streetwise cat that I am I immedietly countered with a look of extreme anger and mistrust and demanded to see where it says that I had to pay twice. Having the paperwork on me of course worked to my benefit as he could produce nothing. After the two minutes of haggling it was time for my pal and I to see our room. We were given the key to room # 14 a few stories up, I grabbed my luggage and headed 2 feet from the desk towards the only direction other than the exit which was a narrow decrepit carpeted monstrosity someone could also describe as a staircase. I went on to lug my hefty baggage upstairs when I almost tripped over the ridiculous amount of garbage strewn across the first landing, I wobbled and regained my composure then proceeded up the next flight of stairs. We finally reach our destination. Room #14 we open the door and find ourselves in a room as follows, Four disgusting soiled walls with random holes and hand prints everywhere. Three mattresses pushed together to form what I guess was supposed to be their equivalent of a kingsize bed (hence the knickname we gave the hotel the Royal Carbigoe) linen strewn with I kid you not, pubic hairs. Notheless It reminded me of something youd see in the home of abusive foster parents. The carpet was stained and reeked of urine, was also torn in most areas. The sink jutting out of the wall was rusted and when we turned the knobs we were shocked to find brown water spurting out from the faucet. For entertainment my friend and I were shocked to see a non-functioning 1960s era television set that Im sure not even the salvation army would have excepted as a goodwill donation from a dying 80 year old man. The furniture could hardly be called even that. Our dressor unit looked as though it had been manufactured by a three year old, it was crooked and had rusted nails sticking out of every nook and cranny, even the dcor on my Marine Corps issue wall locker was nicer. Overall this place was a dump. But as heinous and awe inspiring this room was we could not overlook the one comforting amenity the management was so kind to include, and that was two stained and dirty coffee mugs with two wet instant coffee packets, even a complimentary half used roll of toilet paper. thanks guys. Well, were only here for two days we both thought since we are only using this as a place to crash out at night what the hell. Hmmm Why then am I writing this paper? Please continue reading.We were both getting cleaned up before getting ready to go out for a night out on the town, although I must admit it felt a bit more like getting dirtied up in this joint. My friend came dashing up the stairs, I could tell 10 seconds before he entered because of the increased creaking coming from the floorboards beneath his feet. He came in wet with a beach towel wrapped around his waist (they didnt even supply us with a towel) on his face was the look of disgust. He said Deniz man the shower is clogged.. I ran down to investigate and opened the community shower which was at best a 4ftX4ft closet that had been tiled inside and converted into a shower by someone simply jamming a pipe through a hole in the wall and then chiseling a hole in the side of the floor which was clogged up due to cigarette butts jammed up inside its crevice. I wanted to puke at the site of dirty water overflowing into the hallway and onto the already moldy dirty carpet. Nonetheless after a half hour of drainage I was able to take a 30 second shower myself by quickly wetting my body down then to subdue the imminent flooding that was about to occur, quickly shutting off the water and soaping up (with my own soap of course, they didnt provide us with any. Although their was a dirty brown piece of soap floating on the shower floor..) then I rinsed off very quickly (the shower still overflowed). My buddy and I quickly got dressed and locked the door behind us running from this disaster.. we were quickly slowed by the Arab man who ran the front desk stepping into our way and propositioning us to bring him back some ladys when we returned later that night. Although I cannot speak directly for the opposite sex, I will go as far as to call this man the sketchiest person alive. We ran down to Victorias station and after this episode we were determined to hit up a bar in order to drown out the awful feelings this brief encounter with the carbigoe hotel had induced.We returned sometime in the wee twilight of morning, I wont go into detail of our exact condition but it was good enough so that we didnt really mind lying down in our disgusting room and passing out. We were both in a deep comatose slumber when at sometime between 7 AM and 8 AM we were awoken by a banging and kicking at our door. Could this be real? Was I dreaming? I quickly came to and my friend from the other side of the room (yes we moved the beds) babbled in a half sleepy tone what the hell is going on..?? I got up went over to the door and asked who it was. In a thickly accented language one might call English our Arabian friend who we can also now refer to as Mr. Sketchball was demanding we open up and let him in. Well since I am only a guest in his Royal Palace of Carbigoe I was obliged to do so. He came in, this time wearing a brown leisure suite but with still the butterfly collar and gold rope knecklace adorning his hairy chest. Sketchy sat down on the edge of my friends bed. He spoke of things, many things but it wasnt until he pulled out a set of keys from his leisure suit pocket did we actually comprendo what was going on. He said in a raspy voice whilst exhibiting the sly smile we had both come to know and love you go upstair, new room, today we have construction demolition this room. Hmm.. could this be true, was our friend Senor Sketchball really demanding we leave this room so he could destroy it. What luck!!! So we gladly agreed to Sketchballs demands and told him within one hour wed be ready to relocate, he gave us a grin and said Yess you lucky, today you move up in Carbigoe. What could we say after that?Although I dont recall what room number we were now moving into, it was located directly above our current lodging and as we made our way through yet another set of wobbly stairs and through the mountain pass of garbage left on the landing and up over a stream of toilet paper stuck to the floor in front of our new accommodations we breathed a sigh of relief. One more night here and were GONE. Amen. We opened the door and found a room almost identical to the one from the night before, except for one improvement. This time there were no holes in the walls. I felt flushed, I felt angered at the thought that our good friend Mr. Sketch hadnt accommodated us this well the first night. I know this room was vacant because for nothing less than novelty my friend and I had toured the hotel top to bottom the day before taking pictures and documenting the other oddities we found hilarious. Makes you wonder. Anyways this time we left our luggage and locked the door, setting out for our last day in London. We got done sightseeing around 9 PM and headed back to the Carbigoe, thank goodness, only a few more hours left and we were out of here. We had to wake early in the morning, approximately 1:30 AM so we asked Mr. Sketch if he could give us a wakeup call, he agreed but I asked him how he would go about this since we didnt have any phone in our room, he smiled  Chills ran down my spine as I became even more creeped out than ever before as he grinned. I then asked again so, sir how do you plan on waking us up? he pushed some yellowed, cracked button on the wall and I heard a slow whiney buzzer go off, ingenious! He has a system, well see if it works. I turned to Mr. Sketch one last time with hope in my eyes and asked him also if he could call a cab for us to be ready and out front at 1:45 AM. He looked back and grinned muttering something that sounded like no problem. This I believe is common practice at most hotel establishments around the world. I suggested we pack up early so we wouldnt have to worry about it at 1 AM My friend agreed so we did just that. I looked on the floor and saw a dirty black sock, thinking it belonged to my friend I almost went to pick it up when my friend informed me it wasnt his. I had noticed this sock since earlier in the day but I just assumed that it was his. I guess I was wrong. But someone tell me this, WHY IN THE WORLD was there someones dirty used sock on the floor of my hotel room, I paid to stay in this hotel room WHY! Before we hit the hay my friend suggested we walk back downstairs to check out our room from the first night. We did so and were shocked to see a sheet tacked to where there was once a doorway, we peered through even further and to our astonishment found a demolished room, Sketch wasnt kidding when he told us a demo crew was coming up there that day, I mean I took pictures this room was completely destroyed, I smiled at this thought and said to myself this was perhaps a good thing.Luckily my cellphone alarm went off at 1:30 I never heard the buzzer. My friend and I got up, I was ready first so I told my friend I would go downstairs and find out if our friendly front desk attendant had called our cab since he hadnt woken us as he promised. As I sped down the spiral of doom known also by the name staircase, I heard the buzzer go off. Slick guy you are Mr. Sketch, Very very slick. This guy was so on the ball that when he heard me coming from all the way down on the 1st floor he felt compelled to push his stinkin button, that way I could never say he hadnt done for me what little he could. Thanks. So I make it downstairs and I see Mr. Sketch, not smiling, not frowning but rather dismayed and in panic. He had not called the cab. Our bus was leaving Victorias at 2:15 AM, it was approaching 2. Thanks again Sketch. So I kindly and patiently asked him Sir, could you please call us a taxi? It is urgent. He assured me that he would and picked up his cell phone and smiled, slyly he hung up after a few words and said ok I call, you pay me now. I looked at him and assured him that when the taxi came I would pay them myself, and that I appreciated his kind goodwill gesture of trying to take that burden upon himself. He fumed back No you pay me now for call Taxi, service me pay cell phone bill! I laughed, could this be for real, this fellow who had made our stay a virtual nightmare, whom I showed more compassion and leniency than most without so much as a single complaint, could he really be mad at this simple and favorable request. Even after all the money I had paid to stay in this dump, which I might add is a considerable amount for what could be considered a negative five star establishment, Mr. Sketch still wanted more. That was it, it was time to release. I looked at Sketch, I stared him right in the eyes and saw nothing, no feeling, no conscience, no remorse for his selfish and devious ways and I let loose a verbal assault with such eloquence and tact that he could say no more. He stood there silently staring at his pathetic wall as my friend came down and joined me in the akward silence that seemed to last forever, although in actuality it was only momentary. A car pulled up, not a taxi but rather another middle eastern gentleman in his own private vehicle and Sketch motioned us that our cab had arrived. This was what we call where im from in Boston, a Gyspy Cab which I believe is quite an illegal practice. Sketch and the driver spoke and embraced, perhaps our taxi driver was a relative or fellow crook, we didnt care at this point we had a plane to catch. So we climbed into this so called taxi to knowingly get overcharged and headed out to nearby Victorias station never to return to that stink hole called Carbigoe again. NEVER. Overall London was great, but I attribute none of this to our hotel at all. If anything this hotel was the only blemish on our entire trip which took us to many other destinations over a 2 week period.For those wondering why I would take my time and write such a piece let me say this. If it is not already evident I am not a writer, this was not for profit and this was not to defame the establishment mentioned, at least not for personal gain. I was so compelled after staying in this establishment and so dismayed that there appears to be no regulations or sanctions to prevent this place from operating and advertising falsely I might add on reputable websites such as expedia or hotels. Lastly I will simply state that I wouldnt have my WORST enemy confined to this rathole. The management is horrendous and this is a building that ought to be condemned. Like I stated earlier I have clearly slept in rougher places, but certainly not by choice and certainly not for any kind of fee. So Carbigoe, I surely join many, many others in saying your hotel is the MOST heinous and disgusting hotel I hope to ever, ever see. For people reading this please take my word and dont subject yourself to this type of masochist abuse by staying here."
45,660,"Mar 14 2005	A little Gem	Having paid such a nominal amount for what we thought was a 'Budget Hotel' in London, imagine our surprise as the concierge opened the front door, we were greeted by a large marble floored reception with a beautiful chandelier hanging above the centre piece fountain.Our initial surprise turned to amazement as we were shown to our fully en suit room. Beautifully furnished with a Moroccan theme, the view from the room over the rooftops with the London Eye glistening in the distance was simply breathtaking. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi the size of an olympic swimming pool and the fresh flowers lying on the bed epitomised the level of service and care that the staff of Carbigoe Hotel show to their guests (how refreshing)! The restaurant had a fully a la carte selection that would seriously challenge Mr Ramsay at Claridges.This quiet little &quot;gem&quot; tucked away in sleepy Belgrave Road is an absolute delight and we have no hesitation in recommending the Carbigoe Plaza Hotel (they even do a Honeymoon special rate - superb)!The truthIt was shocking. Unfortunately i am unable to use a similar word beginning with the letters 'sh' to fully describe how awful this hotel really was."
46,660,"Mar 10 2005	The Pits - Vile!	I wish there was a minus scale rating on Tripadvisor as this hotel does not warrant even 1 out of 5. It is vile and I was bitten by bedbugs!!!!! Disgusting, dirty and most certainly unprofessional. I would't even consider it to have Youth Hostel standards - honestly! I wish I had read the reviews below before booking.....do any official tourst boards act on the information stated by guests on advisory sites such as this? If so, the reviwes give plenty of reason for the place to be condemned, closed down and...if possible, bulldozed! PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS HOTEL."
47,660,"Mar 6 2005	Good	please, people is really funny. If you want low cost dont expect a 5stars service. The hotel is good , i stayed 3 nights and everything was ok. Greatings!!!!!!!!"
48,660,"Feb 16 2005	If you are looking for hell you find that on Carbigoe	This hotel isnt even worth lookin' at. For starters we arrived to found out that our order had mysteriously been lost. The guy in the lobby tried to trick us three times into some &quot;special&quot; deal that was in fact the same as regular price. Then finally we got this crappy hole in the basement, room number one with one double bed and two single beds. The double one, was terrible so say the least and the other two were broken. The bathroom was like the bathroom in the film Trainspotting, we had to ask for the hair dryer and there was no soap or nothing. The guy in the lobby doesnt look like he is trustworthy and you will feel insecure at this hotel. The check out time isnt 11 or 12 like they say on the homepage but it is 1030 so if you leave at 11 then you have to pay an extra full day. To sum up this is the worst hole I have ever found in London, the worst lobby guy in the world and I seriously hope that nobody ever goes there again."
49,660,"Feb 7 2005 	Looking for sexual harrassment? Book this hotel...	We reserved a double room at Park Hotel, 64 Belgrave Road in London through a travel agency. When we arrived (10:30 pm) at the hotel, the owner/receptionist told us the hotel was being repainted. So he took us to another hotel, Corbigoe Hotel, 101 Belgrave Road. He and the owner/receptionist at Corbigoe looked at us a lot... and looked pleased that we were from Sweden (or &quot;Swedenland&quot;, as they called it).We got a double twin room on the top floor (fifth floor, no elevator). Sure, it was spacious, but we were asked to only use on of the beds. The mattress and the pillows were lumpy and hard, and just felt really nasty. The shower was drizzling (not fun, we both have very long hair...) and we had no soap nor towels upon arrival. We did not dare to use neither the mouldy fan nor the spotty water boiler. On the second night the owner wanted us to change to a smaller room. So we had to carry down all our luggage, from the fifth floor to the reception, and wait in the breakfast room (damp wallpaper and broken blinds) while he looked for another room.After 15 minutes he returned and said we could keep our room. After trying to offer us free beer several times he helped us to bring back the luggage to the fifth floor. We then remembered to ask for new towels. We first got a towel with spots, so we asked him to change it. But he first invited one of us to the balcony (through the fire escape door) to, we suppose, romance her with the &quot;beautiful view&quot;... Of course that did not work. The other one of us agreed to follow him back down for yet a new towel. He first looked in the reception desk, but claimed there were no towels left. So, he grabbed her hand and led her downstairs to the breakfast room, where he had a closet with &quot;fresh towels&quot;. Upon return he pinned her to the wall and put his arm around her waist, and whispered &quot;Do you feel comfortable?&quot;. &gt;&gt;Yuck&gt;&gt;. She said &quot;nonononono&quot; and ran up the remaining stairs back to the fifth floor.On our last day he asked us to please stay for a cup of tea, and even wanted to give us breakfast for free. But we wanted to leave this nightmare as soon as possible and instead asked for a receipt. But he refused to give us one. &quot;No, you don't need it.&quot; &gt;&gt;Excuse us?&gt;&gt; While talking, he would not stop shake hands with the one of us that asked for the receipt. Finally, he asked if she was happy (??!!) and said that she was a fine girl. And hugged her. &gt;&gt;Yuck again&gt;&gt; When we left the hotel, he was checking us out one last time. Maybe he will miss us, we definitely never want to see him nor his Park Hotel-accomplice ever again.We will not return to London for quite a while..."
50,660,"Jan 17 2005	Worst hotel ever!	Carbigoe hotel can be described with one word: discusting! I can't believe how anyone can call this a hotel! The room was dirty, and the bath room was probably never been washed. The reseptionist made the whole place even worse! In the middle of the night, somebody tried to brake into our room, so we refused to stay there more than one night. We cancelled our stay there, and were suppose to get money for one night back...we never got those money. If you wanna feel safe, never stay at this hotel!"
51,660,"Dec 21 2004	abhorrent	When I booked this hotel I understood completely that it was a 1 star hotel. I am in no way a hotel snob and have stayed in quite a few lower grade places. This hotel ,however, should have a negative star grade. It is absolutely horrible. I thought the stairs were going to collapse on the walk up to our room. When we opened the door we discovered not 2 but 3 twin beds shoved into our room. The comforters had dirt and grime all over them. My dog has better bedding in his doghouse. The hotel was doing some kind of construction on the floor above us and the sound was terrible. My travel partner and I left immediately. I booked the room through Expedia and I am extremely disappointed. The pictures on their website are not of this same hotel. I strongly urge no one to stay at this establishment. Also, please double check all hotels if you are booking through Expedia or any other company."
52,660,Dec 16 2004	Run don't walk away from this hotel	I booked this hotel on line and paid ahead of time and they gave my room away. I called two hours prior to arrival because my airplane was late getting in. The manage said no problem we will keep the room for you. When I arrived they had sold my room as well as another couple from Spain. I had no money on me so they charged my credit card 20 pounds for cab fair. My husband and myself as well as the Spanish couple had to share a cab to a hotel that was 1 1/2 hours outside of London. We did not even arrive untill in the hotel untill 5:00 am. I was only staying two days in London so this basically ruined my trip. I consider myself lucky not to stay there as the whole hotel smelled of mold. The pictures of the hotel online are not the hotel at all. There was an award plack on the wall from 1970. I think it must have been the last time they cleaned.
53,660,"Nov 30 2004	nasty and ugly	Wow, this was the nasties place I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in hostel's before. The carpet looked like it hasn't been clean in over 100 years, and I am not exaggerating. The ceiling was stained. At least it was all there, because the first room they tried to put us in, it was missing a big chunk. The bathroom was the best of them all. It was so small that you could sit on the toilet, brush your teeth over the sink and take a shower at the same time! The TV was more of a decoration because it didn't work. However, the location is great and it is safe. It just depends on how low you want to stoop for your living conditions."
54,660,"Oct 3 2004	Stay Away- Worst hotel experience ever	We arrived at Victoria station in early September, 2004 at 10 pm (25 min walk with luggage). Pimlico station is only 5 min away but this is not advised on the web site. On arrival our internet booking was confirmed and we were asked to pay for our 3 nights in advance with a request for cash as part payment as &quot;the receptionist had to go shopping early in the morning&quot;. (Being tired and wanting to rest we agreed)After we had paid we were then told there were no rooms available as our room had a damaged door that could not be locked and were escorted to another hotel in a nearby street for the first night.At this other Hotel we were asked to wait for the room to be made ready. We asked to see it immediately and found the room unclean with an ash tray full of cigeratte butts (we had always requested a NON smoking room).We refused this room and after some more phone calls (never in English, so we could not know what was being arranged) we were taken to another hotel where we were given a room on the 3rd floor. It was clean and acceptable. We were told they would come back at 9 or 9.30 in the morning to take us back to Corbigoe Hotel for the remainder of our stay. We left at 8.30am the next morning to visit the Corbigoe to see the room first, as we had doubts. The room they were to give us was still occupied, so we couldn't inspect it. The 'receptionist' knocked on the door and asked the lady when she was leaving (we were embarrassed that he disturbed her). She said she was leaving at 10.30 as arranged, and when I apologised that she had been disturbed, and that we had just asked to see our room, she put her finger and thumb to her nose and indicated by sign language that it was smelly.We queried about the room with the broken lock that he had said would be fixed, and he said, 'I'm giving you my best room'.We left for sightseeing, returning at 7pm. We looked inside the room, and the bathroom stunk. We said it was unacceptable and very smelly. We asked for it to be cleaned, and left to have dinner.When we returned about 8.30pm, it was obvious nothing had been done to clean the bathroom. There was mould on all the walls, and the toilet smelled badly from not being properly cleaned, and broken dirty tiles on the floor.When we complained again, they then took us to another hotel down the road, which was a basement room with an even smaller bathroom, about the size of a toilet with a shower and handbasin in there as well, that was in very poor condition; and the room was even smaller than the one we had been in.We refused that room and returned to the Corbigoe frustrated but with no other choice but to stay the night. We were shown the cancellation policy that if you don't like it, go elsewhere; everywhere else is very expensive they said, and they would not refund the money for rent.When we asked to see the owner, we were told he may be there the next morning about 10.30, but they were not sure if he would be there. It was difficult to find out who had any responsibility -one minute the man called himself the manager, the next time he was just the 'receptionist'; their story of their position kept changing.On the third morning we asked to leave our luggage till later that day. We were told (by a different 'receptionist' who said it was his first day), that it would cost one pound per piece of luggage to leave it. He said we could leave it in the hallway, and when we asked for a secure place, he offered the breakfast room downstairs. He said 'we've never had any problems'. How did he know if it was his first day?My husband called him into the room, asked him to step into the bathroom, and said, 'would you like to use this bathroom? (because of the smell) He replied 'no sir', and agreed that we should not be charged to leave our luggage.I am sure there are some quite reasonable hotels in the area, but always always inspect the room before you pay your money."
55,660,"Oct 1 2004	The worst Hotel I ever stayed in.	DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!! This hole in the ground should not be called a HOTEL. The rooms are Disgusting. The manager makes you pay first and then tells you that the room you booked is not available, then he puts you in a dirty room. Stay away from this place unless you want to get ripped off."
56,660,"Sep 25 2004	badbadbad	This was our first stop on our european tour this summer and we didn't get off to a good start at all. When we first walked in the room, I felt like crying. The carpets were dirty, there was hair on the bedsheets, the bathtub was plugged so everytime we showered it took forever to drain, and the complimentary coffee was on a tray on the floor! To make matters worse, my mom found a dirty sock under her bed! I cringe even just thinking about the experience. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. The staff is also very rude! DO NOT stay here no matter how tight your budget is!"
57,660,"Jul 28 2004	Do Not Stay Here!	Our booking was originally for the Corbigoe Hotel on the same street. After walking for 25 minutes from Victoria Station (with luggage), we were greeted by an unfriendly man who spoke no English except, &quot;I don't speak English. Please wait.&quot; Eventually, another man (whose English was not much better) came from another hotel to collect our money. Then, he made us move to the Park Hotel because Corbigoe was overbooked. After giving us the room key, he informed us that breakfast was not included in our room rate, even though when we reserved the room, it was included. He told us that we would have to pay 3.50 pounds each if we wanted breakfast. When we protested, he dismissed our arguments and continued to tell us that breakfast was not included. We found out the next morning, however, that fighting for breakfast was not worth it, since it was simply cornflakes and bread (hardly worth 3.50)!Our room was on the 4th floor, no lift. The room was tiny, with only an aisle of one foot to walk around. The bathroom was tiny (smaller than a cruise ship!) The toilet did not flush all the time, and the water was either really HOT or really COLD, and the shower did not have adequate water pressure. The room was filthy. It was obvious that it hadn't been vacuumed in a very long time, and during the 4 nights we stayed there, it was never vacuumed. The trash was only emptied once, and we never got enough towels. There was a kettle to make tea, but after the first day of using the teacups, they never replaced them. Every morning, around 4am, we were awakened by a loud noise emanating from somewhere in the building. The doors squeaked a lot, as did the stairs, so we could hear everyone in the building moving about. All members of the staff were discourteous and could care less about customer satisfaction. We were never made to feel welcome at all, except when we paid for our room. All these people care about is your money, and they don't seem to understand the concept of customer service. We were not the only people who had problems with the hotel. There were two other parties who were moved from a different hotel, and each got into a shouting match with the staff.Whatever you do, don't stay at Park Hotel or at Corbigoe when you come to London! This is the worst place I have ever stayed at. Even youth hostels are better than this!"

2,661,Sep 28 2008 	Bring some ear plugs!	Hopefully of help to would be patrons - the Hotel is ok for spending the night in London. Generally it looks clean but there was a layer of dust on the TV and in the wardrobe of our room. We also found a 'Rentokill' box hidden in one corner of the room which tends to make you think that there is an unseen problem. The water pressure was almost non-existent from the sink but luckily the shower was reasonable.Sleep maybe possible if you take a room in the upper levels - we suffered from people going outside to smoke at all hours (and I mean all hours as the last crowd finally went in at around 03:45). The room doors have a nice gap a the bottom so the light streams into your room when someone walk down the corridor - and speaking of that

1,662,great location lovely staff but needs double glazing	Arrived early for check in but staff kindly let us in to our room early since we had been travelling from early morning. Room nicely decorated but bathroom very small. The main problem with the room was a very bad draught coming through the window very cold. Think double glazing would solve the problem of the cold and the road noise which kept us awake.Area lovely but not much to do in the immediate area not a great choice of entertainment. Taxis very expensive took one to west end cost us twenty five pounds each way. All said we enjoyed our stay needs a few minor adjustments.
2,662,"Nov 20 2009 	Very Hot Very Small but Very Clean ""Superior"" Room???	Checked in at 12:05pm and this process was very quick, very easy and two hours before we could check in! the reception staff asked about a morning paper and explained about breakfast times and asked if I wanted to open an account on my room, this was an excellent start to our 3 day mini break in London.Room 567 (Superior Room) here we come, plenty of lifts close to reception upto the 5th floor and then I opened the door to our (cupboard) room.The room I have to say was very warm and very clean but also very small, my concern was if this is a superior room I really would not like to stay in a standard room. I was unable to turn off the radiator in our room only down, we had to sleep with the A/C on all night ( It was too hot) and with the size of the room I woke with a fantastic headache the next morning ** note ** go out and put A/C on whilst your out and also sleep with window open, its quiet enough to do this. The bathroom I thought must be massive in that case and as I opened the door I realised this was also tiny, just big enough but careful in the bath / shower as there really is not a lot of room!The hotel location is only two minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station (Central Line) very useful, and has a small taxi rank outside the hotel again very useful and Hyde Park over the road (nice) The Swan Pub is next door and a corner shop just after the pub both useful for our stay.The staff are very polite and very helpful, breakfast is very good better than I expected to be honest and the hotel is very clean!!!Overall, I thought the staff are very good, the location was good, the price was OK, the room was poor BUT clean, I decided not to complain because we only spent limited time in the room anyway!"
3,662,"Nov 17 2009 	Great Location faultless service organised	Stayed here for a night in October and a night in November 2009. Rooms really nice, small, but really clean and modern. Bar open until very late. Breakfast was superb, I was astonished how good it was, great eggs, beans, bacon and sausage.No complaints."
4,662,"Nov 16 2009	Lovely Hotel...	I dont understand what people can complain about with this hotel! I stayed here begining of November for my 21st birthday with my mother and sister. Check-in was easy and fast, room was fine! After looking at reviews and pics on here we were abit worried, but it was really nice! Not much space for 3 of us to store and hang our clothes, but we were only there for the night. It was clean and comfortable. Nearest tube station - Lancaster Gate was approx 5 mins walkin distance. Everything else was in easy reach. We didnt eat at the hotel, so cannot comment on the food, but The Swan pub next door, does a lovely breakfast! I would deffinetly stay here again and recomend 2 other ppl...despite the drunken man shoutin outside our room at 2 oclock in the morning."
5,662,"Nov 14 2009 	Great Location Well Appointed	Right across the street from Hyde Park, the hotel is very comfortable and clean. Nice size for London and continental breakfast is very pleasant. Best feature is location and access to transportation - Central Line tube stop very close by and frequent local buses take you to Oxford St"
6,662,"Nov 11 2009 	Hotel had everything we needed	Lots of other reviews state rooms are small,I found them adequate.The Hotel has a great location,handy for the tube and if you like to walk you can walk to Harrods etc through Hyde Park or Oxford St no problem.There was a great selection at breakfast,cooked or continental.Will use this hotel next time"
7,662,"Nov 9 2009 	Not as bad as previous reviews	Myself, sister and my mum stayed at Corus for a weekend break. Due to previous reviews, we almost cancelled are stay but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. It werent as bad as a lot of people worked out. The rooms were clean and modern, the bathroom was small but big enough and I couldnt touch the four walls as a previous reviewer suggested. All of the staff were friendly.It was a 2 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube station which is on the central line and close to all tourist attractions. As a few people commented on the wait for breakfast, we went to a pub 2-3 doors away, called the Swan. A good full cooked breakfast, served immediately for 8 each.All in all a good hotel for the price, close to everything you need to see, a pleasant stay."
8,662,"Nov 3 2009 	Great view. Great location.	This was a very easy, middle-of-the-road stay. I asked for a room with a view of the park, and they gave it to me. I asked for a better hair dryer than the one in the room, and they provided one. We asked for more towels, and they arrived within two minutes. The room was small, but we expected that. The room was updated, but the bathroom was lacking. It wasn't as clean as it could have been, but it wasn't anything I wouldn't do again. One major downer, but not a deal-breaker, was that our room was literally right next to the pub next door, and one night (Friday night) we couldn't get to sleep until after midnight because of the noise. We knew of this complaint from previous reviews, but we just assumed we would probably be at the pub too, however, we weren't, and it was really loud. I'm sure you could request a room far away from the pub if you think it might be an issue. Good price. Hyde Park is gorgeous and right across the street. We walked through the park to Harrod's and to Buckingham Palace...quite a jaunt, but it was nice. I would stay here again."
9,662,"Nov 3 2009 	smart tip	excellent location, small but very &quot;stylish&quot; rooms, very quiet, just across hyde park/kensington garden, 50 m to Lancaster gate (district line) underground station, a lot of different kind of restaurants in walking distance..."
10,662,"Oct 31 2009 	Great location curfuffle at breakfast pokey rooms poor disabled access	I went down there with 3 other pals (one in a wheel chair) for a boys weekend, On check in we were offered single rooms in stead of the twins we had booked, we jumped at the chance. Our good fortune turned out to be short lived as the single rooms were tiny, being over 6 foot i banged my knees in the bath room more than once. The bath is quite difficult to get in and out off, however even on the 8th floor the shower was excellent. There are 3 lifts/elevators which had mind of there own, I did feel like a little boy playing in the lifts trying to go to breakfast going up and down 3 times before I reached the reception. If you have booked a full english package, which tecnically speaking is not true as they serve butter from scotland and seville orange marmalade. Seriously what you get is well worth the money, the only issue is when you get into the dining room. you need to be in there as early as possible to prevent getting stuck in a queue in the lobby before going down to the dining room. To be fair to the Hotel we were warned about this problem and they do lay on tea and coffee for people waiting in the queue. The only issue I have is that they are not dealing with true problem of the queues and only dealing with the consequences of the queues.The location of the Hotel is good, just over the road form Hyde Park and a short walk from Lancaster Gate tube station. They do not have a recognised disabled access method, which caused our part problems."
11,662,"Oct 30 2009 	Definitely NOT a 4* as indicated	This hotel was described to us as a four star ...it was not!!! The room was cold and pokey with little space to pass each other between wardrobe and bed, It was supposed to be double glazed too but the draught was lik a gale. The window sills were covered upon our return in the vening with at least 12 ladybirds. Breakfast was well presented and managed though but that is the only positive thing about the stay. We will NOT be returning as it was such a disappointing experience. PS forgot to mention the gentleman in the room next door snored all night long so no sleep was had by us !!"
12,662,Oct 29 2009 	Not up to Standard	Had booked with local travel agent and paid extra at time of booking for room upgrade. On arrival the allocated &quot;superior room&quot; was the size of a wardrobe and although spotlessly clean was in no way equivelant to the 4 stars it purports to be. Spoke to receptionist who was very nice and re-allocated us to a room on the 10th floor which she stated was of the same standard and price. This room was 4 times the size and more in keeping with a 4 star establishment. The real problem came next next morning at breakfast. After standing in a queue for 15 minutes our room number was noted and we were informed there was a further 30 minute wait for breakfast. After a complaint to the manager we received a full refund for the first days breakfast as we refused to wait and were fast tracked into the dining room for the rest of our stay. The staff were very helpful at all times and I cannot fault them but this does not make up for the shortcomings of this hotel and I would not recommend it.
13,662,"Oct 29 2009 	Bank Holiday weekend break	Unfortunately we read the reviews on this hotel after we had booked &amp; paid for it. Had we read them beforehand we would not have done so. The room itself &amp; bathroom were tiny, far too small even for two adults (and we are by no means large adults). It was obvious that this was originally a good sized room which was divided in two to produce two rooms which are totally inadequate for any normal person to stay in. Everything about the facilities was small &amp; cramped and this is the first hotel that i have stayed in where a double bed, out of necessity, had to be pushed against the wall !!!!The bathroom was ridiciously small. Really not much more to say about it.We were told on the day we booked that it would be wise to get down early for breakfast the following morning as the hotel was very busy. Having read the reviews we took heed of the warning and were down at 7.30am the following morning. Obviously everybody else was told the same thing and crowds started to build up around 8.00am. By the time we were leaving the dining room at 8.15am there must have been 40-50 people queing to get in for breakfast. We made sure to be down at the same time on the following morning but having to get up at 7.00am while on holidays, just to get in for breakfast was not acceptable.On the plus side the location of the hotel itself is great, very close to Lancaster Gate underground and right beside Hyde Park which is beautiful. The rate per night was reasonable but i definately would not stay there again nor would i recommend it to others. I would much prefer to pay extra and have the feeling of staying in a hotel, not a shoebox!!!"
14,662,"Oct 29 2009 	Small rooms but convenient location	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel for 3 nights from 17th to 20th August 2009. The exterior and reception areas of the hotel look very decent, butthe room that we had was really tiny. We had asked for a double bed on booking but on arrival they gave us a room with twin beds, that couldn't be joined together either because the room light was situated inbetween the beds. Also the hotel was fully booked so we could not even upgrade. The room had no wardrobes, only a metal rod with some hangers to hang clothes out. There was no space to store luggage. And the bathroom was cramped. So from a room size perpective, it was not good. However, the location of the hotel is excellent. Across the road is Kensington Garden and two tube station, Paddington and Lancaster Gate are within very easy reach so you can travel anywhere at any time. There were some lovely restaurants in the area as well. Other amenities were also closeby, such as a laundromat and internet facilities, that were much cheaper than the hotel.So if you're just looking for a place to sleep at and intend exploring the entire day, then this hotel may suit you. Otherwise give it a miss."
15,662,Oct 28 2009 	Full English? Expect to wait... and wait... and wait...	My thoughts:1. Small room overlooking staff's smoking area- lovely smell of tobacco wafting into the room. 2. Really liked the idea that i could brush my teeth whilst sitting on the toilet and soaking my feet in the bath!3. Nice that they offer coffee and tea in reception area in the morning- not so good when you realise it's because when you go for breakfast you are told there are 40 others in front of you and so to expect a half hour wait at least! Something we were not warned about on check in. When we complained we did have a refund for breakfast that day (as we decided we didn't wish to waste the day waiting for a breakfast we'd paid for like 40 others) and were booked straight in for the day after. However i realised the reason for such long queues was that tables were not turned around quick enough.4. May sound trivial but biscuits. (It all adds to the experience) Well the lack of them with tea and coffee. When we saw them on the house maids trolley we were told they were not available for the type of room we had! What nonsense! I do think paying hundreds of pounds justifies a biccy with your tea!5. Yeah great flat screen TV as advertised but a shame that you can't tune them and that only terestrial TV is available.6. If you use your shampoos and body wash on first day they are not replaced.
16,662,"Oct 26 2009 	nobody has mentioned the queue for the breakfast!!!	Oh dear corus!! Lovely hotel with a great location, just far enough away to walk to Regent street and other sites in London, but 4 star - no way!We have never had to wait over 25 minutes to get a table for full english breakfast before, we have been to many hotels in the UK and had to wait a few minutes for breakfast but not 25 - that is terrible. Some people we spoke to had booked to go on the London Eye but were not sure whether they were going to make it, and if you have paid for full english surely you should expect it. Could not fault the staff as they were coping with it very well, the problem is the restaurant downstairs was too small for the amount of guests - not good enough Corus. We upgraded to an executive room which was on the 10th floor and was very roomy - well worth doing. The only problem was the whistling noise coming through the celing vents, whats that all about??? It didnt happen all the time but at 7 o,clock in the morning when your on a leisure break its not a great thing to happen. We booked in for an evening meal on the saterday night and we could recommend this as the food and service was excellent and good value. One more tip to all visitors to this hotel, if you want to have a drink either before or after your meal go to the Swan pub which is just around the corner on Bayswater Road, much cheaper and an excellent atmosphere. Overall we had a great weekend break but could have done without that wait on a morning."
17,662,Oct 25 2009 	Pokey Rooms	We booked a standard room. Huge mistake. The room was so narrow you had to get on the bed from the foot. A pathetic looking ironing board hung off the wall next to the bed and a tacky little metal fan was fitted to the wall to cool the room down. The window was fitted with ironwork which made the room look more like a jail cell than hotel. Everything was done on the cheap.
18,662,Oct 23 2009 	Lovely but bit out of the way!	The hotel itself looks pretty from the outside and inside looks really elegant and nice. The rooms are small but you can't expect much bigger in London really! I don't think it's worth the price as it was really quite expensive (80 per night) but it is a really nice place to stay. The nearest tube station is Lancaster Gate which is about 5/10 minute walk away but there isn't really much in walking distance without the tube. The nearest shop was quite expensive so I'd advise having something already with you if you're going to get peckish on your way home from a night out! Taxi driver had a bit of trouble finding it too.
19,662,"Oct 18 2009	Great location tiny twin room with grotty outlook	The hotel location was excellent beside Hyde Park at the top of Oxford Street, the reception staff were friendly the breakfast great. The twin room 308 was very small and dark and with a horrible dirty outlook and it smelled slightly damp. I didn't complain as I was with my teenage daughter who didn't mind, it was not the only one in the corridor and it was a last minute deal, however I would not accept that room again in what is suposed to be a four star hotel. I would recommend for the location with the warning to check the room first."
20,662,"Oct 18 2009 	stayed at the Corus Hyde Park	It's a 3 stars hotel, so I didn't expect much (part of a long business trip in the city). I was actually really surpriesd. The staff was really great and welcoming, my room was a bit too small for my taste, but it was okay. I ordered through last minute travel site, the price was affordable. Right on the corner of Hyde Park, that was amazing."
21,662,"Oct 16 2009 	Great Location	This hotel is in an excellent location, very near the tube and opposite hyde park. However the regular rooms are very small, we had to upgrade to the family room to ensure a good standard of room. Breakfast was nothing special, limited choice and availability. Staff fairly friendly but as its a very busy hotel can queue for a while at reception and bar areas."
22,662,"Oct 9 2009 	Clean and friendly place to stay	I read some of the reviews on this site before our stay and agree, yes the rooms can be on the small side. Our room on the seventh floor was fine for our four night stay. We had a faulty lightbulb which was attended to swiftly. The food was great and one thing I'd recommend is the pre-theatre dinner two course meal for ten pounds each. The portions are not large but certainly filling and beautifully presented-not just thrown on the plate. We were served on both nights we did this by the lady who showed us to our breakfast table each morning. We wondered if she ever got to sleep at any time! She always seemed to be there. All the staff we came in contact with were very friendly and efficient. We will certainly consider staying here next time we are in London."
23,662,"Oct 9 2009 	ok hotel but standard rooms are frighteningly small	We booked the hotel based on the nice photos on the website and seemingly great price. When we arrived we found that our &quot;standard&quot; room was more like a cupboard under the stairs, we could barely stand up in it and immediately had the sense of panicky claustrophobia! To get a normal size room you have to get an executive type room. We booked it online through British Airways, and initially were told that the hotel wouldn't allow us to upgrade ourselves when we asked to pay more, but thankfully someone from BA spoke to the hotel and we were allowed to pay more money for a normal size room. The foyer is nice and smart and the location is great."
24,662,Oct 7 2009 	An OK hotel but rooms VERY small...	Having stayed at many London Hotels in the past I stayed in the Corus Hyde Park for my wifes birthday to allow us to see a show. The pictures seen on the website do not do it justice. Checkin/Out easy and quick. Breakfast---interesting one here. MASSIVE queues just to get in for breakfast in the morning plus MASSIVE queues to actually get food. Staff during breakfast seemed uninterested. Bar---clean and quick. Room. We stayed in a double room. This BY FAR is the smallest hotel room we have EVER stayed in. The actual doors to enter room and enter the bathroom wereabout 3/4 the size of a regular door. I am a big person and some times I had togo in sideways...no kidding. The room felt as if an original normal sized room had been partitioned down the middle with a false wall. The bathroom was so small i could touch all four walls easily with alimb while sitting on toilet. The shower was excellent but to enter shouwer the side of the bath was so high that I imagine some people may find it difficult to enter/exit.All in all a good hotel and value for money.....but rooms terribly claustrophobic.
25,662,"Oct 6 2009 	OK Hotel	Good hotel clean and tidy, good location right next to Hyde Park, facilities just what you need for a short stay and won't break the bank, just don't eat in if you like adult size wholesome portions - try the Swan pub next door. Not that the foods not good - it is, modern tasty and good service - just tiny portions. If they were intended to be works of art they would be priceless . After a hard days shopping, sightseeing or work however its just not what you want or need!"
26,662,"Oct 6 2009 	very enjoyable stay	Good location, 3 mins Lancaster Gate Tube. Room clean and with everything required. Staff courteous and helpful.Breakfast perfectly adequate.Double/secondary glazing would have been helpful for traffic noise."
27,662,Oct 6 2009 	small rooms	The standard double room is too small and not worth the price. Too many peolpe for the breakfast during the weekend. Wating time 20-30 minutes. Next time I'll find another hotell.
28,662,"Oct 6 2009 	Small but well-equipped room in a good location with FAST lifts/elevators	First trip to London. 20th anniversary gift from DH. Lobby is attractive, modern. Check-in was slow. Waited about 12 mins. to check in, tough when you're hungry. One of the best aspects of the hotel was the bank of elevators. We were on the 7th floor and those things were FAST and there were plenty of them, I think 4. Very pleasant surprise and great since we constantly forgot things in the room or ran up to drop off jackets or umbrellas after walking outside to face yet another gorgeous warm late Sept day. High ratings to London and Mother Nature for producing those jewels.The room was laughably small, very plain with stark white walls and threadbare carpeting at the entrance, but overall well-appointed. Room was about 7ft x 15ft. (plus tiny bath) with a double bed at the window end tucked in the corner against 2 walls. Our neighbors must have thought I was sending code because I knocked my elbow against the wall every time I turned over. There were no drawers or closet/armoire, just a rack to hang things so we basically lived out of the suitcases, which I hate, especially for a 3 night stay. There was a long angled desk and chair with a huge mirror (and magnifying mirror built in) that really saved the room. It was so convenient for me to get ready at that unsteamy mirror while my husband showered. AND the hairdryer (which was very powerful and not the typical hotel blower) was located at that desk. My hair looked GREAT in London. I also loved the shower, once I figured out the arrangement of knobs etc. Good water pressure and roomy enough. The hotel should invest in one of those curved shower rods to give a little more space. Biggest drawback was the noise. Our room was at the junction of Bayswater Road (a very busy street that runs along the north edge of Hyde Park) and a side road. There was traffic all night long. I was glad I saved the airplane ear plugs because that saved my sleep for the last two nights.We really liked the location. Hyde Park is a lovely place to walk and sit outside. Our first day, we walked down to the Victoria and Albert Museum, saw the very impressive monument to Prince Albert (a one mile walk from Corus) and Diana's fountain (less impressive, the Royal Family could definitely have done better with that). The Lancaster Gate tube stop is a block and a half away so very convenient, though we ended up taking the doubledecker buses everywhere and enjoyed them more (nearly half the price of the tube as well).Food: a continental breakfast was included in our package so we did eat there each morning, preferring to save our dining pounds for other meals and there wasn't a wait any morning for the continental. My expectations weren't high from reviews I'd read, but the spread was sufficient for our needs. Every day was the same: a platter of very nice ham, a variety of packaged cheeses, croissants and rolls, oatmeal, cereal, some unappealing fruit, plain yogurt with fruit sauces to stir in, tea and coffee. I was happy to see the ham and cheesethe protein kept me going until lunchtime. We didn't try the restaurants but were disappointed by the early closing of the bar and even more so the Swan next door. We tried to go there at 11:45pm on a Saturday night when tables were still occupied outside and we were shooed away by the waiter who insisted they were closed. Not so pleasant to the touristsin fact few of the bar staff we encountered were anything close to welcoming. We were surprised because we are a former bartender, cocktail waitress couple who knows our way around a drinking establishment. Definitely NOT pushy or obnoxious, plus we tip well (which I don't think is the custom in the UK). All in all a pleasant stay at the Corus. I might like to try another hotel (there are tons in the area) if the price was right and the reviews were excellent, but in the Hyde Park area, I would recommend Corus."
29,662,"Oct 4 2009 	Poor	This hotel, in my opinion, is best avoided. We stayed two nights, wither end of a trip to Tokyo. We had booked a family room, which turned out to be an outsize double. Cleanliness wasn't fantastic, and the whole thing felt a tad grubby and dated. There weren't even enough towels for a family. The family sleeping accommodation was two double beds pushed together 'Goldilocks and the three bears' style! The first room in particular was poorer, on a corridor that stank of stale cigarettes. Safes were either inoperative, or not screwed to anything. What a waste of time.On both nights we were distured by fire alarms, and when i stumbled downstairs to find out what was going on, nobody knew. Shambles. Breakfast was a ridiculour price, so we ate at the nearby Craven Cafe, which was very good. I managed to get 50 off my rate for the inconvenience. If I had more time to do some research, I wouldn't have stayed on my return. I cannot recommend this hotel"
30,662,"Sep 30 2009 	Fantastic Convenient and Spotlessly clean	Lovely hotel in very close proximity to Lancaster Gate Tube. Rooms were very clean, couldn't fault them. Staff were friendly and eager to help. Bathroom small but has everything required. Ironing board and iron in room, flat screen remote control TV, hairdryer, air conditioned... No drawers though, which I found a little irksome.Breakfast was self service and no queues, served from 6.30 - 10 am. Plenty of choices to suit everyones needs. Word of warning.. we returned from the theatre and decided to visit the hotels restaraunt, however it was closed at 10.30 pm!! Walk out the doors of the hotel and across the road into beautiful gardens and on Sunday mornings the local artists display and sell their work on the railings to the park.. very nice."
31,662,"Sep 16 2009 	Just what I needed	Booked a single room at this hotel at the last minute, having got a ticket for Proms in the Park. Hotel was within walking distance of venue.Nice, but small, quiet room on 5the floor with A/C, Flat screen tv and small bathroom, perfectly adequate for my needs. Room was clean and bed very comfortableStaff were excellent.Didn't eat in hotel."
32,662,"Sep 12 2009 	Great Location	Stayed for three nights in what most be one of the smallest standard rooms in London.Bathroom was tiny, but both the room &amp; bathroom were very clean Hotel is well placed for Hyde Park &amp; close to Paddington Station &amp; tube links.Check in was smooth &amp; staff were very helpfull.Breakfast wasnt worth bothering with! You had to stand in line until your room number was called, then you had to find a table &amp; serve yourself. Food was luke warm &amp; of a poor choice. ( breakfast was served in the basement which was a rather drab room ) Many tables had not been cleared ,generally an unpleasant experience !We found a good take away around the corner .  They would cook anything that you requested for a fraction of the hotel price !!( &amp; it was of a much better quality) The local police &amp; taxi drivers all ate there !!!!!!!!The bar was nice &amp; made the best vodka lime sodas &amp; they had a very comprehensive selection of whisky.We would stay here again ."
33,662,"Sep 12 2009 	OK .. in the end	My experience was a tale of 2 rooms. I was initially given a room on the 8th floor which was more like a cell than a hotel room. It was so small I had difficulty in getting my bag through the door. The room was dark, dingy, and the carpet smelled badly of cigarette smoke.After complaining, I was told that I could be upgraded for the discounted rate of an additional 20 per night. I had a second go at trying to be moved which was successful. The room on the 9th floor was much better and resulted in a pleasant stay.Personally I thought the hotel was not great value compared to other hotels of similar standard.On the positive side it is in a good location, ideal for Hyde Park."
34,662,"Sep 8 2009 	great value for money	this hotel is really good, i enjoyed staying there, mostly the location is great. I ordered the room through easyclick and i think it was a good price. The rooms are very nice and clean. I wouldn't say it's very fancy, though, and the rooms could be bigger. but the location is so great that I really didn't mind. Hyde park is right outside the hotel, and the tube is so close."
35,662,"Sep 7 2009 	Corus is a hotel I'd stay at again	Stayed at the Corus from Aug 23-28/09. Have to say that the location of this hotel is fabulous. Hyde park is right outside the door, and the Lancaster Gate tube station is close by. I recommend getting a tube pass for travel around London, we purchased a 7 day oyster card but found that we didn't use the bus system. Very easy to access the tourist attractions from this hotel.I found the hotel was exactly what I expected...a mid-range hotel with rooms on the small side. This is my second stay in the same area of London, and the rooms at the Corus are huge in comparison to the last hotel. I think this is to be expected in London unless you are prepared to pay the big $$$.Extremely friendly staff, clean rooms, internet access in the lobby (for those of us that do not have laptops), and breakfast every morning. I must say that the breakfast is very mundane, but there was something there for everyone. Staff was excellentI would recommend this hotel to anyone as a very reasonable, clean, and central place to stay while in London."
36,662,Sep 3 2009 	Not 4 star. Three at best. Entrance nice but rooms tired and very small.	We booked a superior room for a weekend break with superbreak. Luckily we got a good deal but would have been disappointed if paid any more. Fire alarm went off each morning and this could be very dangerous as people ignored it. Sunday went off at 9.30 in morning for about 10 minutes. Breakfast was slow to say the least and asked for receipt on checkout to show that we had no bill to pay and they were unable to do this. Location great and very close to tube. Was clean but I have stayed in better rooms in 2* bed and breakfast. Poor quality fittings in rooms.
37,662,"Sep 2 2009 	Great Location canny staff good breakfast but Claustrphobic rooms.	Stayed over the bank holiday period, 1st room (standard) couldn't see out of the window becasue of all the condensation and its position. For the price they charge for a standard I expected something far, far better than that. Very claustrophobic. This should really have been a single room judging by the dimensions.On complaining, was upgraded to an executive room free of charge. This should be the level expected for a standard room, certainly not what I would call an executive standard. Bathroom was small but usable. However, because the extractor fan did not work mildew was forming on the grouting.The room itself was very clean and the maid service was good. There was a very unusaul smell perveying around the corridor on the floor we occupied. (5th)The meals were ok, unfortunately as the breakfasts are self-service, the food is continually topped up during the period and is kept hot in the baine-maries. (only the weekend before we stayed in a country hotel and breakfasts were cooked to order and prices were half the costs ). The staff in the restaurants were very welcoming and pleasant enough.We took an early &quot; Theatre Dinner&quot; which was quite nice but not a great deal of choice. Our waitress, a polish girl by the name of &quot;Blanka&quot;, seen to our every need and was very charming and very efficient with a good command of english.The fire alarms went off in the early hours, twice. An apology was placed in the lifts but apparently it is a frequent occurance.The hotel has an underground station only 100mtrs away ( you can feel it when lying in bed) and is across the road from the parks, the main city centre isn't too far away if you enjoy a walk.The previous year we stayed at the Tara Copthorne and was a better hotel in comparison and much cheaper. The owners/management should have a real good look at what it charges for its rooms and the level of accommodation on offer. Sorry, but just because its got a good location does not justify its pricing policy. Would we stay there again? I don't think so. I heard other people say it was very good, well theres no accounting for peoples taste is there."
38,662,"Aug 30 2009 	overnight stay	Stayed at Corus 1 night. Had upgraded to executive room. Room was small, bathroom tiny, decor tired. Hate to think what standard/superior room would have been like. Breakfast not included. Large queues for breakfast.Location superb opposite Italian gardens Hyde Park. 10 mins walk in Hyde Park following serpentine brings you to Hyde Park Lido, great location on lake for breakfast, full english breakfast 6.50 + healthy alternatives, juices etc.Hotel average, location great"
39,662,"Aug 28 2009 	Lovely Hotel Great Location	This hotel is in a great location, just beside Hyde Park and within walking distance of the tube. The rooms themselves are a little bit small but are really clean and comfortable. The Swan pub is around the corner and offers some lovely food at a reasonable price. I will be staying there again when I go back again in October."
40,662,"Aug 25 2009	Never again - 2 nights twice as many problems!	The location of this hotel is great - same could not be said of some of the staff and their accounts department. Evening meal on the first evening was when it came alright, however when it came to pay the bill we were ignored and in the end my daughter went to bed. Only after another 25 mins did I finally get the bill!Made a cup of tea in the room and the long life milk was off !Breakfast - dont bother with the full english - you have to give your room number in then are told to wait untill it is called out. We were told around 15 mins - 45 mins later after others had come down after us had gone for theirs we asked what was happening , &quot;Sorry we overlooked your room number.&quot; Safe to say that on the second morning we booked breakfast to be taken to the room. Finally we paid our bill for the stay only to receive a letter later the following week saying that they had had problems with their card machines and would I kindly send them a cheque for the amount owing. Luckily I still had my receipt and card authorisation code and have contacted my bank to check, who told the amount had gone through on the said day. Contacted the hotel and told them only to have a half hearted apology. Their account had also since twice tried to put my card details through without my being there.Be very careful staying here with your cards! Location is not worth being conned!!!"
41,662,"Aug 24 2009 	Great Location Not so Great Hotel	I can't recommend this four star hotel. The rooms are tiny (usual for London) and painted stark white, like little hospital rooms with absolutely no character or charm. Unless you upgrade your room, there are also no fans or air conditiioners and consequently the little rooms heat up very quickly. The staff is indifferent and somewhat snippy. The continental break at around 8 pounds is difinitely not worth the money. I suggest picking a three star hotel with a little local charm and staff who care if you live or die."
42,662,"Aug 21 2009 	good choice	I had the opportunity to stay in three different types of rooms on two seperate occasions at this hotel.... all in a span of few days.Thing is we were a party of three enroute canada... and had reserved one single and one standard twin room.We arrived early in the morning and were informed that single room was ready but the twin room would not be available till 2 pm.. however they offered us an upgrade to executive twin room for 30 pounds per night.i stayed in the single room while my companions stayed in the twin room. On our return from Canada we stayed in london for one night in standard twin room... and heres my take on the room categories..The standard single and twin rooms are small... but very comfortable.. specially if you dont have more than a single suitcase each. Rooms are fitted with modern amenities, flat screen TV, inroom safe, climate control, kettle and tea/coffee.Bathrooms are also on the smaller side but very clean. Adequate towels, washcloths, tissues, etc.Rooms are kept very tidy too.Continental breakfast was included in our room rate and was the usual fare. Nothing special.The executive rooms are much larger. But I believe they havent been refurbished in a while. The standard rooms have more contemporary fittings.I guess if one needs lotsa space the executive rooms are fine. But if one doesent plan to be in the room for a long time, the standard rooms are more than adequate.The location of the hotel is very good too. couple of mins walk from lancaster gate tube station. A taxi ride to nearby paddington station costs around 5-6 pounds, and gives easy access to heathrow via the heathrow express ( 16.50 pounds, per person, one way, standard class).I have stayed at the Cumberland during one of my earlier visits, which is better located ( right next to marble arch tube station)and is a four star hotel, but its also lot more expensive.Comparitively, the Corus Hyde park offers better value.If I am on a business trip to London again, I would definitely stay at the Corus."
43,662,"Aug 20 2009 	excellent for a theatre break	the only down side was that the bed side lights did not operate separately so when my son or i woke up in the middle of the night we did not feel able to put our bedside light on for fear of waking the other person up as they were operated on a joint basis only.other than that friendly staff, convenient location, excellent breakfast choice."
44,662,"Aug 19 2009 	Good clean no frills hotel in good location	Very welcoming staff and good, clean room. Like most hotels, not a lot of room for two largish cases but that is normal.Facilities good and real nice food."
45,662,"Aug 18 2009 	Good location enjoyed our stay !!	Just back from a 2 night stay at the Corus ( booked via Travel republic ) Board was B&amp;B ( contintental).Hotel is really close to Lancaster Gate ( central line ) and overlooks Hyde Park, about 10-15 mins walk to Oxford streetLobby area quite nice, our room was not ready until 2pm. The room itself was small, but cosy, beds comfortable, aircon working, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilties. Bathroom was small, but clean, good power shower. Breakfast was ok ....could have been better ( more fruit) but was adequate, the breakfast room was nice and the seat by the window was lovely in the sunshine.Staff friendly enough, nice little bar area. Would stay again, for the price and location ."
46,662,"Aug 18 2009 	nice hotel but definitely not a 4 star hotel. not value for money.	I chose this hotel on the basis that it is a 4 star hotel and was very disappointed. we stayed in room 602 and oh my goodness it was the tiniest room ever, even by london standards!!we booked into the viceroy, Executive room and wished we'd never bothered, as I'm sure the standard room couldn't have been much smaller! I wish we'd complained now looking back but i am going to complain as it really was tiny!! even the door into the en suite wasn't a full size door!!the staff were ok, nothing special a bit like walking into a travel lodge, hotel was clean but very average, not at all a 4 star quality!the food for breakfast was good but the service in here were terrible! tables were left messy and while we were eating used plates/bowls weren't moved as we had finished using them. staff were generally pleasant and well mannered but it all seemed apologetic at the state of the service. again not 4 star!in general I would say it's an average 3 star hotel not a 4 star so with that the rooms are VERY over priced even though hyde park is on it's door step and it's very close to lancaster gate tube station."
47,662,"Aug 16 2009 	Not Bad	This hotel has a great location just outside of the central city. The concierge and front desk staff are not very friendly, but overall the hotel is decent. The room was a decent size. We had trouble with the toilet not flushing and maintenance came to fix it twice before it worked. The continental breakfast is lacking. They only provided the bare minimal in food. Overall, for the price, location and surroundings."
48,662,"Aug 10 2009 	Awful	I have stayed in many hotels in London over the years for business and pleasure. I was so disappointed by this hotel. On arrival we were checked into a room that can only be described as a rabbit hutch, the air conditoning did not work, there was no windows and the &quot;bathroom&quot; door wouldnt close. The en-suite was so small my partner could not stand up. We went back to reception and they offered to upgrade us for a fee of 20 each to a room that was still so so small and again the air conditioning did not work.We lasted one night in this hotel, when we tried to complain the staff were unhelpful and rude. I wouldnt wish anyone to stay in this glorified B &amp; B"
49,662,"Aug 8 2009	A hotel to go back to in London.	My husband and I just returned from a 3 week trip thru France tovisit family, a trip to Paris and a 5 day trip to London before coming home. We were just delighted with the Corus Hotel. Withone exception, everyone was polite, efficient, helpful and gave youthe feeling they were there to go the extra mile if need be. And forthe one or two glitches, they did indeed go the extra bit. The hotelis cozy and upbeat with a really nice reception area and bar andrestaurant. We did go down the road for a much cheaper andexcellent breakfast. That was the beauty of this hotel. It is located next to the Lancaster tube, across from Hyde Park anddown the avenue from stores, buses, Marble Arch, etc. I wouldabsolutely recommend this hotel to friends and we will most certainly return. We stayed five nights so they upgraded us, no charge, to aroom that was perfectly fine with a large bathroom. We had no problems with the service, wake up calls, etc. All in all, avery good experience."
50,662,"Aug 4 2009 	Excellent hotel - just order a larger room :)	We stayed at Corus Hotel Hyde Park for four nights. We loved it. Just make sure you order a larger room. Our first room was the tiniest hotel room Ive ever been in. Room around the bed only on two sides, no closets, and no room for the suitcases and in the bathroom you could wash your hands while on the loo. Thankfully we were able to upgrade after the first night. And it was like going from hell to heaven. Suddenly our room had a living area, a walk-in closet and the bathroom (with shower AND tub) was larger than our first room. Disregarding the first night, this hotel was absolutely fantastic. The service both at front desk and restaurant was superb. The room was bright, clean, modern (goes also for the first tiny room).I would not hesitate to go back ?"
51,662,"Aug 3 2009 	Clean hotel/good location	Stayed here for a 3 night trip with my partner. Located very close to both tube and Paddington Station in order to see the sights. Lovely buffet style english breakfast, but only downside is that it can get v busy and you have to queue for a table. Staff were friendly &amp; helpful. Rooms were small but very clean, we asked for a quieter room and the hotel provided this for us on the tenth floor.Room could do with a bit of redecoration though. Overall though a nice hotel and good value."
52,662,"Aug 2 2009 	disappointed	We booked to stay here for a 3 night break to London. The location is good as its very near Lancaster Gate tube station on the central line. We had a standard room and it was tiny, the smallest room I've ever stayed in and I felt quite claustrophobic in there. The bed was small for the 2 of us, not sure if it might have been a 3/4 size and not a double. However we really weren't in it very much so I guess it didn't matter. Bathroom was fine but again tiny. We had breakfast included in the basement restaurant which was fine, full english, the usual.It is fine for a one night stay or for someone on their own on business but definitely not for a romantic break to London!"
53,662,"Aug 1 2009 	Great Location value for money but room small and breakfast slow!!!!	Hotel was in a nice location, close to a tube and a bus stop. However as previous guests have said the rooms( Superior) are small and the breakfast is very slow!! On the first day there was a 20 minute wait for the full english breakfast (downstairs) so we opted for the continental (upstairs). It was ok - croissants and coffee/ juice etc. but no fresh fruit. The next morning we opted for the full english,after all that's what we had paid for and we were told it would only be a few minutes. We were called out by room number and made our way downstairs expecting the breakfast room to be heaving. Not all, verging on empty and it appeared that the reason for the delay was lack of staff to clear tables. On the whole it is value for money if you get a good discount but I would have been extremely dissapointed if I had paid the full price."
54,662,"Jul 31 2009 	nice hotel in the centre of london	i stayed here for 3 nights for a break to go shopping and see london. it was a nice hotel in a great location. the rooms are extremely small though and with your suitcase, theres not much room to move around. its a typical boutique hotel but its location is really what makes this hotel great. its right beside the lancaster gate underground stop and therefore it makes seeing the sights in london very easy. its directly across from hyde park and a 20 minute walk to oxford street although i always used the tube as it only takes 2 minutes to get to oxford street. The breakfast is fairly standard but its a full english. the continental is terrible though. theres more to choose from in the continental section of the full english breakfast restaurant. if you can get a decent enough price for thishotel (which is hard to as it is london) but around 90 - 100 a night then it'll be well worth it"
55,662,"Jul 20 2009 	Fantastic location service food!	Close to Lancaster Gate tube station we found the hotel clean, comfortable with excellent staff. The rooms are well designed and compact, not for those with a fuller figure. Of particular note is the hotel restaurant which offers early theatre suppers as well as both Malaysian and English evening menus. I would have no hesitation on reccomending this hotel to others."
56,662,"Jul 19 2009 	Brilliant hotel close to lancaster Gate Tube station	Lovely hotel overlooking Hyde Park easy walk to top of Oxford Street and the biggest Primark! Excellent Service, we booked this as a cheapy girls weekend and did not expect a full english breakfast to be included. 3-4 mins walk to Lancaster Gate tube station, arrived back fairly late at night and no feeling of threat at all as can often be felt when leaving tube stations as a couple of women on their own. Good pub next door. Overall a lovely hotel and would not hesitate to book again."
57,662,"Jul 17 2009 	Compact but comfy	I arrived at the hotel exhausted from a delayed flight from Glasgow to find the hotel easy walking distance from paddington station, However if you are taking the tube I think lancaster gate is closer. I was delighted to see how close it was to Hyde Park across the road! The reception area is nice and very courteous staff, I was a bit dismayed to see a sign charging 30 for air con but luckily I had it in my room. Also there was a 5 surcharge for breakfast in my room which I felt was a bit steep. But that was my only concerns the room itself was very small but very well laid out and very modern, Lovely comfy bed and great shower! Although the green neon light in the bathroom is dubious but I suspect its just to look good! Tea and coffee where fine and I had an iron and trouser press in my room. Sat TV a lovely LG plasma for ctaching up on the news, We went for a walk and arrived in a lovely arab part of town which gave me lovely memories of Abu Dhabi the smell of the shisha and lovely arabic food. The room at night was quiet consiering it was central london this was fab and the shutters on the windows really kept any noise to a minimum, all in all great hotel great price if a wee bitty small."
58,662,"Jul 12 2009 	Location fantastic - room ""compact and bijou"" though!	Booked the Corus through our local Thomas Cook on a two-night Superbreak. Great value at 110pp including rail travel, even adding on another 55 each for a theatre/dinner package made it a well-priced London break.Pleasant reception area, extremely polite and helpful young lady checked us in very speedily, nice to get two keycards. Room on 6th floor with our &quot;usual&quot; London view - the backyard and the rubbish bins! - but could hardly expect panoramic Park views for the price. Room was clean but by some distance the tiniest double room that I have ever encountered in over 30 years, even the room door was narrower than standard size. Shower room (no bath) 6 tiles by 6 - assuming 8in tiles thats 3 and a half feet - miniscule handbasin and correspondingly tight shower. I'm average height and weight, my wife is petite so no problems for us but too bad if you're built for comfot rather than speed as it were..........Bed similar in that not full size(?) and against the wall. One chair, hanging rail (no enclosed wardrobe, no drawer space at all), ironing board, hairdryer, decent sized desk, massive wall mirror. Wall mounted TV, full Freeview, air con with excellent controls, good lighting. Full breakfast was good - the downstairs restaurant not as nice as the brasserie - a touch canteenish, but good selection of hot and cold food and again unfailingly polite and aattentive staff, plates cleared quickly and efficiently.As others have commented, location cannot be faulted, barely a minute to Tube station in a well-lit area opposite Kensington Gardens. 4 star rating a tad ambitious - would look for a full size room with wardrobe / storage space, bath and armchairs, but for a base to do the London tourist bit this hotel certainly ticks the boxes."
59,662,"Jul 11 2009 	Good for London	I admit to being slightly worried at some of the reviews on the site (I never book anywhere wthout consulting Trip Advisor) Normally in London we stay at the Ruebens, but this was a last minute rail inclusive deal so we booked perhaps despite the reviews. Without exception all staff very very friendly and helpful, the public areas spacious, the English breakfast very very good if perhaps served slightly &quot;canteen&quot; style. The room was very small but very clean and very well equipped with air con, flat screen t.v., and even iron and ironing board. Perhaps the biggest plus was the location with easy access to Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate tube and Marble Arch. Certainly not in the same class as the Ruebens, but at perhaps a third of the price its certainly somewhere I'd stay again."
60,662,"Jul 10 2009 	Great Location Small but clean rooms	As other reviewers have said, the location is great. Room we had on third floor was small but clean and more than good enough for us (how much time do you actually spend in a hotel room when in London anyway!) Bathroom particularly small, but again it was clean and the shower was great. It was very hot when we were there so the air conditioning was good to have. Wooden shutters on the windows (instead of curtains) made the room dark and quiet so no problems with getting woken up in the early hours!We were on a full B&amp;B rate, this was more than satisfactory and set us up for a long days walking!We walked from the hotel down to Leicester Square and took under an hour and had a lovely sunset walk round Hyde Park which is across the road from the hotel.We had a great time in London and a great stay at Corus Hyde Park and would definately stay there again"
61,662,"Jul 9 2009 	Great location small but adequate room - nearly came to grief on their internet booking system!	We booked this hotel well in advance as at 109 it was a good(ish) value solution to staying near the Hyde Park concert venue. The location couldn't have been bettered.Check-in nearly didn't happen as I'd failed to notice that due to problems with the Corus website I'd booked a room for the night I tried to book on the website rather than when I wanted to stay! Thankfully the wonderful Monika on reception saved the day and we secured a 7th floor room. Perfectly adequate but very small (the room, not Monika!).The bar/reception area was a pleasant spot for a post-gig drink and the late night store next door a good solution for accompanying late night nibbles! Heard poor reports about the continental breakfast but we used local coffee shop as not included in rate we had."
62,662,"Jul 6 2009 	Good location good price watch the room description!	My partner and I stayed at the hotel last week and all in all it was a good stay. The check in was friendly and the room was clean. We did not eat or drink in the hotel so cannot comment on that. One thing I was rather miffed about was the description of the room.. We paid 20 extra via Last Minute.com for a superior room, but were rather disappointed with the Corus' version of a superior room. The room was really small with no room to walk about at all. There was no mini bar or comfy chairs, the toiletries were basic to say the least and there were only 8 channels on the TV - no freeview, just American news channels. For us it was not too bad as we only paid 20, but for guests paying full rack rate, this could be a bigger disappointment for them.The location of the hotel was brilliant - a one minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube on the Central Line and a 15 minute walk to Marble Arch/Oxford Street. If you're looking for a nice place to eat near the hotel, we ate at 'Island' restaurant which is part of The Royal Lancaster Hotel - great food, great service and not bad value for money, we paid 56 for 2 (we only drank 2 bottles of sparkling water though!)All in all a good stay, the hotel is not four star compared to others I have stayed in - just be careful about paying extra for an upgrade.."
63,662,"Jul 6 2009 	Good Value	Cost 99.00 B&amp;B in advance through last minute so good value. Clean, good location, friendly staff (for London). Relaxed lobby area with plenty of seating. Tiny rooms. Continental breakfast was rubbish, but english breakfast not bad. Smack bang across from Hyde Park. 10 minutes walk to Oxford street. 15-20 minutes to Knightsbridge. Next to Lancastergate tube station. Would not pay the normal hotel rate (220!!) but would stop again for a couple of nights for the right price."
64,662,Jul 6 2009 	Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.	This hotel is in a fabulous location but that's really where the good news ends. They had originally booked us into a non-smoking double room despite my having specifically requested a smoking room. They then changed this to a twin smoking room which was totally unsatisfactory for us as a couple on a weekend break. The room was small and poky with dirty carpet on the floor and the most basic of amenities. The windows were old and single glazed which allowed all the noise from the street to be heard all night. The walls of the room were paper thin and we heard our neighbouring rooms occupants every move. This is definitely NOT a four star hotel as they would like to suggest and we will definitely not be staying there again.

66,662,Jun 29 2009 	Corus Hotel - Slow rude and painful - Do not book this hotel	The hotel is not a 4Star and the staff are positively rude to guests with no sense of customer service. I cancelled my booking beacause it was such a bad experience
67,662,"Jun 28 2009 	What a ""PLEASANT SURPRISE""	Come on readers lets get real, we booked this break on the Super Break Deal, and for what we paid for two nights B&amp;B at the hotel and return fare from the North of England anything above travelling down in the Guards van and sleeping in a two man tent in the back garden of the hotel was going to be a bonus. I must admit that last week looking at some of the reviews of the hotel we were starting to get a bit concerned. We had no need to be, Great Rail Travel, Smart Clean Hotel, I agree the rooms were a little on the small side but they were very clean and adequate for us. We would rather have had a small clean room than a large dirty one. We were shocked after reading the reviews how good the breakfasts were. We had no complaints at all and we have rebooked for a pre Christmas shopping break at the Hotel. We might add that we are picky with regards to cleanliness and decent food, and everything was fine. Probably the best  for  bargain we have had for a long time. Some costs, Taxi from Kings Cross to the Hotel, we paid 15.00 including tip. Get a day Tube Ticket 5-20 each restricted times or 7-40 each any time go any where. Lancaster Gate Station 2 mins away, well worth it. .Good luck and please don't be put off by some of the reviews, go with an open mind and enjoy it. A &amp; J ( Harrogate )"
68,662,"Jun 27 2009 	Great Hotel!!	Just got back today from a one night stay at the Corus Hyde Park after attending The Killers gig at Hard Rock Calling.I only really chose this hotel due to its location to Hyde Park, and seeing as though it had fairly high ratings thought id go with it...Good move....Its a lovely hotel, just across the main road from Hyde Park, it also has Lancaster Gate tube station a two minute walk away. Staff on reception very welcoming, i was checked in, even though i was a little early which makes a change for some hotels!! I had booked a single room as i was on my own, and although fairly small, it was fine..Clean, tidy and with a great shower..It even had air-con...Can't comment on the bar or restraunt as i didn't use them, but they looked popular so i think thats a good sign.All in all quite perfect..Great location and a lovely hotel, what more can you ask?Oh, and as usual The Killers were superb!!!!"
69,662,"Jun 22 2009 	For the price you can do much better than this!	Generally I research hotels before I book them. I guess I was too busy to put a little effort into this. We booked a standard room but were upgraded as there was availability. I would hate to see the standard room! Our room was small and dated. The toilet was like a cupboard that gave little privacy. Thankfully, our stay was short. We were kept awake late at night with a guy packing a van only to be woken at 6 the next morning with the bins going out. Not to mention house keeping at 8:00. Don't bother with breakfast, it's not worth it, we ended up eating out. The bed is something like what you might expect in your granny's. It's really soft and bumpy. It's also the first time my toes tipped the end of the bed, I'm only 5ft 1. What really did bother me was when we went to check out and we weren't even asked if we enjoyed our stay! In this age of economical chaos, it's about time hotels stepped up to the mark. Don't rip people off, charge a price that reflect the quality of the service that you provide."
70,662,"Jun 21 2009 	Too basic to be a four-star in my book	The room here was tiny and cramped, and was very, very basic, with only the minimum of amenities in the room. Not what I would expect of a four star hotel at all. There was a barely functioning television, a not terribly clean bathroom, and generally, the place is tired and in need of a bit of a makeover. Toiletries in the bathroom had clearly been opened and left by the previous occupant, which is not pleasant. I have stayed in much cheaper places with the same level of furnishing etc before. Also, it was advertised as having free internet access, but this only applied to communal areas.On a positive note, the staff are lovely and friendly, and were very helpful. It's a shame that the hotel doesn't match the quality of the staff."
71,662,"Jun 16 2009 	Good location but not very nice	The room we had booked was so tiny that the bed more or less filled it. We paid for an upgrade to a slightly bigger but more tired looking room which we were told was 40 per night, but later turned out to be 40 per person per night. All in we paid in excess of 400 for two nights.The hotel is not in my opinion 4 star and was very noisy at night and in the mornings. If it wasnt for the location I would have gone elsewhere despite having paid in advance!"
72,662,"Jun 15 2009 	Get what you pay for	I got a good deal on this hotel at Hotel.com but I definitely would not consider this a hotel a 4 star and I travel to London all the time on business. My room (#510) was the size of a closet and the bed would not have even fit width-wise. The shower was so short that I couldn't stand up in it and I had to take a shower kneeling down. The electric outlet in the bathroom ruined by electric shaver, even though it has a plug in for a US shaver. It shorted it and it will no longer work. If you want WiFi, be ready to fork over $20, same goes for breakfast. The TV did not work the second night. The walls were so thin that I could hear every noise from the connecting rooms. Think again before you think you are getting an amazing deal on a 4 star hotel."
73,662,Jun 11 2009 	Nice Hotel Good Location for a short visit	This is the second time we have stayed in the Corus this is a great location only minutes from Lancaster gate tube and very close to Hyde park if you like a walk. We had a meal on the first night however this was really poor. The plate was chipped and the food was certainly not cooked by a chef. The room was ok for our short visit would not recommend for anything more than 5 days as you would get very confined in the small space. The morning we had to leave the toilet blocked so did not have to wait to have this fixed as we had to check out. I did advise the receptionist who did not seem to be bothered. I have recommend this hotel because of the location and cleanliness however would advise eat out. Wow nearly forgot we had a fire alarm at 7 am due to someone smoking in a non smoking room the hotel; was evacuated.
74,662,"Jun 8 2009 	Perfect location	This hotel is in a perfect location, its quite and less than a minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station. The bedrooms are clean and tidy, however they are on the small side. We stayed in a standard double room and the bed was tiny and uncomfortable, my partner who is well over 6ft had a difficult time sleeping. The bath rooms are also very small and not being very tall i found it difficult to get into the bath/shower which had a very high side. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, but i dont think i would stay here again."
75,662,Jun 5 2009 	very good	This hotel had great concierge service and could not be handier for sightseeing.opposite hyde park in Lancaster Gate it is great to walk to many venues and good position for Hop On hop Off bus.If you can find time for guided tour of Royal Albert Hall it is worth it.
76,662,"Jun 3 2009 	Hotel nice; staff disorganised; food 	at check in we were offered a MUCH bigger room for 20 a night upgrade, a birthday trip with my bro and our respective partners, so we thought ok. Asked for rooms on the same floor. His room was great, reasonably sized ours was obviously a standard and much smaller room. Asked could we have the room next to theirs on the same side of the corridor told it was taken and that ours should be the same as theirs anyway. I told them not so and wouldn't pay the upgrade. Staff thought our room was next door anyway but was actually a few doors off on the opposite side. Finally spoke to the shift manager who said would change us to the one next door !!! BUT even tho' I told the staff we were in a rush to get to the theatre this all took about 30-40minutes and subsequently got to the theatre late. I found a bug in our bed and my bro found stains in his !! Next day when we went down to breakfast we had to wait 15minutes but were told to help ourselves to coffee (upstairs continental breakfats room which we could have had but weren't told so) when called to breakfast downstairs had to wait another 5mins to be seated in a half empty room. Food stations both upstairs and downstairs were very messy and poorly stocked, food was not nice, both mornings the croissants tasted like they had been out all night. I had to go and ask staff for toast instead of being offered. The first day my bro had room service breakfast, which came with no cutlery and the milk in two large mugs instead of a jug. In the bar in the evening the tables were cluttered and sticky and no-one was around clearing up. the executive rooms we were in had no mini bar just an empty fridge. Either they had major absences or this hotel has very bad HR skills. The standard room we had first been given had a tiny portable tv with a rubbish picture. The building was 4star but all the rest the servicing and food etc was most certainly not. The location however was fantastic !!!"
77,662,"May 31 2009 	other reviews had really worried me	My husband and i have just returned from this hotel after a 2 night stay with 2 boys age 7 and 12. It was a special treat, but after reading some bad reviews i was really concerned in the days leading up to our trip. We haven't stayed in many hotels but this compared well to others that we have stayed in ( also 4 star). We felt that for central London in a very good area of the city and for the cost we had a very good deal. We booked through Superbreaks for 2 nights, 2 rooms and top price show tickets for 560,( show tickets were 240 alone). Yes the rooms are small but who cares? what do you need to do in them? The rooms were clean.Our view was not great but we didn't look at it, Hyde park is across the road so we had lots of lovely views outside. All the staff were friendly ( so were we) and helpful. Breakfast does get busy but they do warn you about that on an info sheet on your bed and they advise to arrive before 8.30 to get a seat straight away and this appeared to be perfectly true. All in all we had a great time and would definatly go back again."
78,662,"May 31 2009	Good hotel in a great location	This is the second time I have stayed in the Corus Hyde Park, the first being in May 2008 - it is difficult to find anywhere else that offers good quality rooms and a great London location at an affordable price.The hotel is just over from Hyde Park and Bayswater Road, only a couple of minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station, which makes this hotel an excellent base for exploring London. If you have half an hour spare, a stroll through Hyde Park in the sunshine and some people-watching is always a pleasant way of killing some time.The hotel lobby is large and airy and welcoming, although I noted the door porter with the top hat who was there in 2008 no longer exists. Check-in was slow as we got the trainee behind the desk, but ultimately went smoothly.Our room this year was an Executive Twin (&quot;Viceroy&quot; in Corus language) which was not one of the recently refurbished rooms that have modern grey furnishings, flat screen tvs etc. Instead ours was slightly more dated, but nonetheless well maintained, clean and considerably more spacious than the standard rooms. The bathroom was clean and standard fare, although has no windows and no extractor fan either - it rapidly turned into a sauna after just a quick hot shower. However we found a big toenail clipping on the bedroom carpet when we arrived and noticed that the soap scum around the bathroom basin (there is no soap dish) hadn't been cleaned up one day, making us wonder how thorough the room-making actually is. Bedding, sheets and towels were all very clean and correct.The room looked east from the hotel which is surprisingly quiet considering the location of the hotel. It was very quiet overnight allowing for lovely, restful sleep. However I can imagine that the rooms overlooking Bayswater Road &amp; Hyde Park are considerably noisier (the traffic never stops!), something to be beware of if you need quiet to get to sleep.Other than check-in and check-out we had little contact with staff as there was no reason to, except at breakfast time. Unfortunately the cooked breakfast buffet, despite being delicious, is a rather chaotic affair over the weekend when the tourists in the hotel all descend for breakfast at the same time towards the end of the breakfast period. Queues rapidly form in the hotel lobby to get into the breakfast room downstairs, upon being admitted downstairs you then queue again, waiting to be seated by the waitering staff. There is an obvious shortage of resources, with staff unable to replenish tables with sufficient cutlery, crockery, milk, etc, and the buffet often running short of plates or eggs or mushrooms etc.. It's not uncommon to see guests themselves scavenging cutlery or milk jugs from other tables. We witnessed complaints from other guests in the breakfast room on more than one occasion, although I noted that the stressed, hurried, and overworked staff always remained very polite and courteous to the guests. However the hotel is obviously aware of this as a laminated notice was left on our beds during Friday, recommending to take breakfast before 8:30am as it was expected to be very busy after that over the bank holiday weekend.The in-house evening restaurant (&quot;Olio's&quot;) is vastly improved from the first time we stayed at the Corus in 2008. In 2008 the food was delicious, but the portions were positively miniscule for the prices being charged - almost to the extent of being an insult. We tried it again this year for an evening meal, and were pleasantly surprised by much larger portions that left everyone satisfied, all still prepared to a very high standard. Probably one of the tastiest meals I can remember having. The following night we opted for their &quot;pre-Theatre&quot; offer for earlier diners, but due to the appalling service where we were waiting for over half an hour between ordering and receiving anything to eat (they claimed the printer broke and the kitchen didn't receive our order...), we only made it to the theatre that night in a sweaty rush with literally a couple of minutes to spare.Locally, The Swan pub literally around the corner does decent pub food, non-extortionate drinks (compared to some places in London!) and is furnished in a very traditional &quot;ye olde English pub&quot; style that I presume appeals to foreign tourists wanting the pub experience, although I found it a bit twee and very dark! Further away from Hyde Park, up Craven Terrace, we discovered some more small pubs and restaurants which looked busy, although this was in the last few hours of our stay so we didn't get to sample them. The area in general feels perfectly safe, especially on the busy Bayswater Road, evidenced by the number of women of all ages walking around on their own, not to mention that it's the kind of area that is home to a few embassies and high commissions.Overall it's a very good hotel to stay in, and I would happily stay here again next time I need somewhere in central/west London. They really need to fix the peak-time breakfast experience, and hope they continue to roll out the room modernisation although the older rooms are still of a very good standard."
79,662,"May 25 2009 	Good location clean good service good value	Stayed three nights at Corus. Our room was quite small (but not the smallest I've stayed in), but modern (flat screen tv etc) and very clean. Could've had a better luck with a view considering the location of the hotel (had a view to an opposite wall about 10 meters away), but it didn't bother us. Staff was very helpful and friendly everywhere in the hotel. Full English breakfast was substantial. Location is quite good, quite a bit closer to West End compared to Bayswater/Queensway hotels. Also nearest tube station (Lancaster Gate) is located 50-100 meters from Corus. Bonus is The Swan (pub) next door (live music!). I've visited London several times during last few years and this hotel has been best this far in its price range. I do recommend."
80,662,"May 19 2009 	OK hotel. Very good location	The room was small but OK, nothing more but it was OK. Location is everything in London, this Hotel is over the road from Hyde park, next to a decent pub and just down the road from the tube. The concierge will keep your bags before checking in and after checking out so we really made the most of our time."
81,662,May 18 2009 	Nice location very small rooms	The location is very good..the staff were very friendly and helpful..However the rooms and bathrooms are very tiny that I hurt myself in the shower (not good for tall guys:)
82,662,"May 15 2009 	Small single room  but clean and tidy	My room was clean and tidy. The TV was good and the air con excellent. My only problem was that my room backed onto the main road. The windows are not double glazed so I could hear the road traffic into tho the early hours, even though I was on the 8th floor! Not good. Apart from that though the staff were great and the hotel quite modern."
83,662,"May 13 2009 	Very good location tiny clean rooms	We stayed at the hotel December 2009, with our two teenager sons. We had two double rooms. The rooms were tiny (our double bed was attached to the wall), but they were very clean and cute. There was place for bagages etc. It was ok. Breakfast was good and the lobby was nice to sit and relax after long hours of walking. The neighborehood was vey nice and quiet. Just across the street was Hyde Park. The tube was just a block away. Walking to city centre was 15 min. I would definetely recommend it."
84,662,"May 11 2009 	Excellent Hotel - would recommend	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again. We stayed from Friday to Sunday.Our room was a good size, and very clean. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The hotel itself was very nice, modern and clean. We did have to wait about 10 minutes on the Sunday to be seated for breakfast, but it is very well organised and the staff work hard to get everyone seated as quickly as possible. The English Breakfast choice is very good, and the quality is good. Location is very good, hotel is right opposite Hyde Park, and its a 10 minute bus or tube ride to all the major sights. Overall, we had a excellent time here, and we would stay again."
85,662,"May 10 2009 	nightmare in the morning	JWe've just returned from a weekend at the Corus Hotel. We booked through Superbreak and got a good deal of 198 for the two of us bed and full english breakfast. After reading reviews of the small rooms with beds against the wall and confirming that with reception, we upgraded to executive room on arrival and on reaching our room were glad we did. The room was small in comparison to some of the B&amp;B's we have stayed in at less than half the price, but was clean and had everything we needed for our stay, with plenty of tea and coffee, butn not especially good quality. The bathroom was adequate and had plenty of soap etc that we didn't use. Our room was on the ninth floor overlooking Lancasther Gate. The room temperature was comfortable, the window's opened easily and there was airconditioning if needed. The bed was a normal double bed size and was very comfortable, there was plenty of extra bedding if needed. The hotel was full but in our room we hardly heard a sound. The reception and lounge areas were bright and well furnished and the reception staff were pleasant and professional but not especially warm. It was almost as if they were reading from a script and not showing any personality. We didn't hear an english accent among the staff all weekend. The main problem with the Corus Hotel is the organisation at breakfast. There isn't enough room in the restaurant and each morning we had to wait in reception until we were called. Once in the restaurant we had to wait to be seated. Staff were running around clearing tables and trying to stock up food but lacked organisation. The breakfast is self service and food was frequently running out, and we were having to wait for food to be re-stocked. Rather than a relaxing start to the day, we felt rushed and left breakfast feeling stressed and jaded. All in all the Corus is a clean comfortable hotel in a good position right by Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate Station and only a short stroll to Paddington Station, but it isn't good value for money and we struggle to understand how it has a 4 star rating."
86,662,"May 9 2009 	Very comfortable hotel superb location opposite Hyde Park near Tube station	Had a lovely stay at the Corus Hyde Park, with a nice room directly overlooking the fountains in Hyde Park - literally over the road. Ideal location for an idyllic stroll through the park along The Serpentine, feeding the ducks and swans in the lake. Children's playground nearby too, although we didn't have a child with us!  Very safe area, set amongst pleasant residential roads of Regency style houses, with a few little shops and restaurants up the road. Also very, very close to the Lancaster Gate underground tube station - just round the corner. We would take the tube four stops along the Central Line (East) to Tottenham Court Road and walk down Charing Cross Road to the centre of London: Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square etc. (or just change to another tube (Northern Line) one stop to get there). Our room was extremely clean. We had a lie-in and didn't leave the room till late morning each day, but they still managed to service the room every day with fresh bed linen, and fresh towels etc in the en-suite. The hairdryer was useful. Air conditioning kept the room temp. perfect. A comfortable, spacious bed - had a good night's sleep. There was a kettle and tea/coffee etc provided to make lots of drinks, too.  Altogether a really conveniently situated, nice hotel and we're looking forward to returning as soon as possible!"
87,662,"May 5 2009 	Great location horrible little room	I should start by staying that I only paid 10 for this hotel room through a lastminute.com offer and it was therefore perfectly adequate. If i had paid more than 10, i would have complained. The lobby of the hotel is nice and if the rooms matched it, it would be a pleasant stay. We had a standard room which was unbelievably small. The bed is up against the wall which means you have to climb over your partner to get out. There isn't any room to move around in the room either. If you only wanted a place to stay for the night and didn't really want to be in the room it might be ok, but if you think you are getting a 4* treat of a room, you will be really disappointed. We might have been in one of the worst rooms because of the deal we got, but while it was clean there was a massive brown stain on the carpet near the bathroom. I'm hoping that it was just a water stain that wasn't cleaned up quick enough. There were also foot prints on the walls (??) and horrible dark hand prints. We didn't get breakfast in the deal so can't really comment on that. The reception advertised our room at 220, which would be a horrific rip off. If you are looking to stay some where less than 150 a night, stay at the City Inn Westminster as it is so much nicer and offically cheaper. If you have booked to stay at this hotel and can't cancel, or feel like chancing it, the location is the only thing going for it. It is right opposite hyde park, walking distance from Oxford Street and if you walk directly across the park from the hotel, you end up at South Kensington, right next to the Science Museum/Natural History Museum. Unfortunately for me, that still isn't enough to recommend it. I probably wouldn't stay there again even if i got the room for 10."
88,662,"May 2 2009 	Very nice hotel in a good location	Booked this hotel in conjunction with a ticket for Danicing on Ice at the O2 Arena through Superbreak. Was more concerned with getting a ticket for the show, so the hotel was secondary in my thoughts.Stayed 2 nights with my Mum and we both thought it was a very good. The rooms are small, we had a standard twin however it was twice the size we had during our last trip which was to Paris. The room and bathroom were expectionally clean and serviced daily. No wardrobe but enough space for hanging clothes for a short visit. Beds comfy. Tea and coffe making facilties and plenty of supplies. Breakfast was included and was OK for us, cereal, cooked english, toast, etc. Don't think we would have paid 12.50 however, if not included.Location was great, right next to Lancaster Gate tube and 15 min walk to March Arch/Oxford Street. Right across the street from the Italian Gardens in Hyde Park, so as we had good weather it was lovely to just cross the street and sit in the sunshine.Overall, both Mum and I would highly recommend this hotel. A good find and will definately return. Finally, Dancing on Ice was also excellent!!"
89,662,"Apr 29 2009 	Convenient but a few issues	We stayed here for nearly a week after flying in from Melbourne, Australia. We believed we could do an early check-in, because of the time we arrived in London, but this was only at another night's accommodation expense. We found the desk staff very helpful and friendly, and happy to help us with our maps and tours etc. We were astonished at the small size of the room! On our booking from Australia, they hadn't checked on our age or mobility, but older, less mobile people may have had difficulties with the bed being up against the wall or the very high bath sides. We liked being on the bus route, plus being really close to the Lancaster Gate Tube Station - get an Oyster Card! Hyde Park is across the road, and Kensington Palace very easy walking. The shops and restaurants quite close on the other side of the hotel are also very convenient. There's a Post Office and Laundromat available there, too. Another close by attraction is 'The Swan' - almost next door and offering great food and entertainment at reasonable prices. We ate there often, as the hotel's Continental Breakfast was a grim affair - very poor choice of cereals and the only fruit they seemed to have was tinned orange segments! Beverages were also quite ordinary. I would caution anyone staying in London to be punctilious about security. Hotels provide you with a good room safe and a note on the back of the door saying that they cannot be held responsible for losses if the safe is not used. Take this advice. Through a moment of absent-mindedness, I found out the hard way..... Internet access is quite expensive here, as in most British hotels, but works very well. The bed and bedding was comfortable and the room well serviced... even over serviced...Breakfasts and room size apart, there is very little not to like about this hotel. We obviously had a couple of other issues as detailed above, which obviously not everyone would experience, and they could have happened in almost any other hotel in London.A big thank you to the excellent front-of-house staff who made our stay so pleasant!"
90,662,"Apr 22 2009 	central location	I had read the reviews about the rooms being small and a soon as we checked in we got asked if we want to upgrade for 30 per night which we chose not to do. We were in room 414 and I was pleasantly surprised the rooms were no where near as small as paris hotel rooms, there was no wardrobe only a hanging rail, the bathroom was very small but it was ok and the shower was good. We were not in our room very much and thought it was perfect for our needs the only moan I had was the window would not open and it was boiling but there was air conditioning. The hotel is nice and there are internet facilities its 6.50 for a minimum of 90 minutes. Put a 1 in the machine rather than buy a token from reception and its a 1 for 20 mins. The breakfast was ok, would never pay 12.50 for it, I appreciated the complimentary paper though. The hotel is right on hyde park and on day 1 we walked through hyde park to oxford street in 10 minutes, the hotel is right next to lancaster gate tube station buy an oyster card its only 1.60 per journey. We ate in the swan oub next door to the hotel, its a touristy pub and very nice food and live music on some nights. I thoroughly enjoed london and would recommend the hotel if you got a good deal, we paid 200 for two nights and that included train fare from edinburgh, bargain!!!!!"
91,662,"Apr 18 2009	Clean hotel great location helpful staff	Stayed in a twin room on 8th floor with my teenage daughter, we were both happy with the room. It had a partial view of Hyde Park. The room was comfortable and a decent size with ironing board, hairdryer, safe, coffee/tea maker and flat screen tv on wall . Plenty of space for two suitcases, carry-ons, and a place to hang clothes. Plenty of space to sit with laptop. The shower was an adequate size for us and the bathroom looked fairly new and clean. The beds were clean and comfortable with a small table with phone between them. The windows had sliding shutters that kept out the noise from the street. The staff was helpful. The location was great. A short walk to Queensway for shops and restaurants and a little longer walk in the other direction to Marble Arch/Oxford Street for shopping and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel."
92,662,"Apr 14 2009 	Great spot nice people room good - shower unuseable	Central spot, good food, nice hotel BUT room small (but clean) however the shower can only be used by dwarfes - its over bath with just 6ft headroom and into this protrudes a ceiling overhang. I am 6ft 1&quot; and fairly big with it and had just an 18inch gap to get my head and shoulders in!!!!"
93,662,"Apr 10 2009 	decent hotel	From the bad reviews, I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. It was close to the tube, across the street from the park. We heard no one! The breakfast was fine, nothing fancy, but certainly good enough. The room was normal small for European standards and clean enough. I thought the staff were very very helpful. I would stay here again, especially because we tend to be away from our hotel except to sleep."
94,662,"Apr 1 2009 	nice hotel and very good location	the hotel is located in front of hyde park. if you've got a room on this side of the hotel you've got a great view. and the subway station is very close, just a few metres. the hotel staff was everytime friendly and very good to kids. good breakfast in the morning for 7 euro. so very nice hotel !!"
95,662,"Mar 26 2009 	I would be happy to stay here again	I was dreading the hotel after reading the reviews- however we came on a personal recomendation. Got a deal with lastminute.com whcih made the rooms cheaper- for the room itself, over 100 is a bit steep.The foyer was very nice and smart. We were able to check-in at 12:30 which was excellent. It was nice to freshen up in our room rather than in the toilets! The room wasn't huge but way big enough for two women to be able to share! The beds were comfy, it was dark enough at night and the shower was clean and powerful. We were woken up at 6:30am by next door who were IRONING. Ther toiletries were nice enough as well. We didn't eat at the hotel, preferring to try different places in London. Overall, a good stay in a nicwe hotel- provided I get a deal again, i'd go back. The location was amazing- 10-15 minutes walk to Oxford Street and 2 mins from tube."
96,662,"Mar 23 2009 	You get what you pay for.	At first glance this is a very nice hotel and good location. We were placed in a room that had been recently been painted (perhaps that very day) and became ill as a result. We asked to change rooms and were placed in an &quot;upgraded&quot; room on the ground floor. Not very upgraded in my opinion. The bedding was clearly aged and towels were clean but stained. The carpeting needed replacing as well. The noise from being on the ground floor was loud, but to be expected.  The manager was nice enough, but the staff was not as polite as I would expect by UK standards. I asked for advice on a day trip at the concierge and he seemed annoyed and uninterested never looking me in the eye. I did my own investigating from there on out. Breakfast is overpriced and crowded. The hotel staff even recommended that visitors arrive for breakfast before eight-thirty so that they could prevent overcrowding. We did as they suggested thus did not have to wait, but was annoyed at a timetable whilst on holiday."
97,662,"Mar 16 2009 	Good location with nice average room	Hotel is 2 mins walk from Lancaster Gate tube. Nice small hotel with average room, should book viceroy rooms. Friendly staff, thanks to Hafiz from concierge, help with tours and entire stay. Traveller with budget will find this hotel is good yet very clean, nice bed and fresh towels. Breakfast was good eventhough same dishes everyday, olio restaurant average only, nothing great but worth a try. I would go back there if i'm on a budget holiday."
98,662,"Mar 14 2009 	Convenient location to tube 	Hotel staff, particularly the Front of House Manager was very polite &amp; helpful.We thought the paid upgrade to a Viceroy room was dissappointing. The room we were allocated was dark, plain &amp; very basic. We immediately complained &amp; the above manager showed us 2 rooms to choose from. We settled on a double room &amp; was offered complimentary Tea/coffee in the lounge.Irritating to have the maid knock on the door at 8am - why?Full English Breakfast satisfactory if not chaotic.Frank - waiter in the lounge area, what a pleasant man."
99,662,"Mar 8 2009 	Great Location! Hotel Average	Hotel - Corus Hyde Park; Good location, no, its a great location! Lancaster Gate Tube 5mins, Queensway Tube 10min walk. Oxford Circus 10mins using the toob!Hyde Park, across the Road. The Diana Memorial playground in Kensington Gdns, is across the road, and a 15min walk. Lots of joggers in the park, and nice for a pleasant stroll. Hotel itself was ok, just that, I wouldnt have chosen to stay there if I had to pay with my own money. But it was ok for a freebie, rooms ok, bit small, nothing special, not particularly modern, but nonetheless they were adequate, but they need sound proofing tho, and flat screen TVs and need more channels (only had 8). The dinning rooms were adequate, and communal/foyer/reception areas all adequate, even if a little bland.Breakfast was OK, but not particularly good value at 12.95 a plate for a full English and 7.95 for Petit Dejeneur (but we didn't have to pay, as it was included in our deal).Reception staff were fine, room wasnt ready at 14:10 when we tried to check-in tho - and thats not good IMO. The concierge was helpful. You can leave your bags with him if you arrive early, or drop them off later and go on a wander, he has London maps and is happy to point out how to get to places and whats in the near vicinity too.Queensway: is just up the road, 10min walk from the hotel, this is more like the real London, less touristic, plenty of ethnic places to eat, North African, Middle-Eastern, Italian, Indian and Chinese restaurants, plus cafe's, Pizza houses, supermarkets, chemists, Banks, coffee shops, waffle houses and up the road is Whitelys Shopping Mall with cinema and more places to eat and drink; the Ice-skating/Ten-Pin Bowling venue is just up from Queensway tube too. Overall we liked the location of the hotel, and if you're feeling fit, you can easily walk to Oxford St from here, its virtually a straight walk. We would consider staying again if the prices was right, because of the amenities close by and that it is well located. With ease of access from the Central Line tube. Its not a great or particularly outstanding hotel itself IMO, but when you're in London you are not going to be stuck in your hotel for much more than sleeping hours, so this make the hotel adequate for what it is, its t the cheaper end of the market, not no-frills as such, but functional. There was nothing particularly to dislike. The location is the winner for this place."
100,662,"Mar 1 2009 	Good location nice foyer small room	I treated myself (I don't usually stay in Hotels - I do B&amp;B). Anyway a few days in London and I wanted a good location. I got this and it has a nice entrance foyer with staff that were very courteous although I didn't have a lot to do with them.My main gripe was the room was tiny. I booked a 'superior double' apparently but couldn't find anything superior. It was nicely presented, clean and quiet but rather on the small side. I was on my own in a double (told you it was a treat) but I don't think 2 people would have faired too well. It's a good job I didn't take the cat as there was no room to swing it, particularly in the cramped bathroom.I spent more money than I've spent on a hotel to stay here as I wanted to be central. I stayed in the Hilton at Gateshead the week before and the room and the experience was so much better than this.I'd stay here again if I could get a good deal but not sure it's worth the money I paid this time - will check for good deals before booking again"
101,662,"Mar 1 2009 	Overpriced	Hotel has a great location - handy for Lancaster Gate, Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens. But I felt their website was misleading. The promise of a superior double room with a separate working area space actually turned out to be one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in and was located in their Mews Block, i.e. ground floor level. Apparently these rooms are much larger than standard but the hotel's website mentions nothing about a Mews Block nor about being on the ground floor (elevated ground floor is probably how they would describe it but you still hear the rubbish being collected, cars driving by and horses on their way to Hyde Park.). The one other off-putting factor was dirty plates in the corridors - I had to walk past half eaten fish and chips left outside the room next to mine from early evening until late morning - not nice. Room itself was very clean."
102,662,"Mar 1 2009 	good location. Modern rooms but very small!	We were staying in a standard double room and whilst it had been refurbished recently and was to our taste, two major things let it down - firstly the double room for 2 people had the bed up against the wall - very disappointing when there with a partner and not something you expect of a modern double room.The bathroom was tiny and although clean and fairly modern you had to shower with your head bent down as there was wall sticking out above the shower which was very poor design. But otherwise, overall good. Staff friendly enough and fairly good value for London. Worth staying"
103,662,"Feb 23 2009	Corus Hotel Hyde Park	This hotel occupies an elegant building in a superb position -- very close to Hyde Park,Kensington Palace and bus and tube transport.The reception area and public rooms are very smart and the staff really helpful and friendly.Breakfast was pleasant and better than many other London hotels but oh dear the room!Having booked a standard double I didn't expect luxury but our room was so narrow that the standard double bed had to be pushed up tight to the wall. Access into /out of bed was made even more of an adventure by having to limbo underneath thedressing table shelf which butts right up to the end of the bed.This room was barely adequate for a single bed but with a double it was ridiculous Reception staff informed me that all of the standard doubles are this small and that I should have requested an executive room--- refreshingly honest and what good advice."
104,662,"Feb 22 2009 	Very pleasant and convenient	My husband and I stayed at the Corus Hotel Hyde Park the last week of April, 2008 for four nights. The hotel itself was very pleasant and the staff were helpful. We were able to schedule a day trip to other parts outside the city through the concerge service at the Corus. The only negative aspect of our stay was that our room was not ready when we arrived (after stated check-in time) and had to return to the hotel more than once only to find out that it still was not ready. Finally, on our third attempt, we were &quot;upgraded&quot; to another room. In the elevator, we realized that the floor we had previously been assigned to was under construction. The room itself was small, which is characteristic of any hotel room or residence (in terms of room size) that I have experienced in the UK. We were, however, very comfortable and had access to everything we needed. There was a hairdryer in the room, so there is no need to bring one (along with the dreaded converter). The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The bathroom a little cramped. but functional, so no complaints there. If you are traveling to London, chances are you are not going to experience the hotel life, anyway, right? We purchased the option of the included breakfast and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the full English. We got up early every morning and had a good sized breakfast before leaving for various parts of the city. I would definitely recommend this option, as it was well worth it in quality and convenience. The hotel itself is VERY well located - the Lancaster Gate tube station is just around the corner (turn right coming out and cross the street and the hotel is just down the block on your right). In addition, Hyde Park is a lovely walk and just across the street - and so is Embassy Row, which is home to several very beautiful residences and is a nice stroll (but don't take any pictures!). There are also always taxis outside the hotel, and if nothing else, the doorman can hire a taxi for you. And, don't miss the fish and chips at the Swan pub next door to the Corus - that is where we started and ended our trip. And the Young's Ale isn't bad, either! If we return to London in the future, the Corus will be at the top of our list of places to stay."
105,662,"Feb 15 2009 	So pleasant after long days sightseeing...	We stayed at the Corus in January - my husband, teenage son and I and we all enjoyed the hotel. We did have the full breakfast, rather than the continental, included in our rate- eggs, bacon, toast, cheese, yogurt, fruit, coffee and tea. We were up early and planned full days, so enjoyed a leisurely breakfast in an almost empty dining room before heading out for the day.The hotel is an extremely short walk from the Lancaster tube station (maybe one block) and a 5 to 10 min. walk to Paddington station. We found the concierge very helpful - he spent a good deal of time helping us with maps, looking up info on the internet for us, etc. and didn't leave us until we were sure we knew what we were doing. The rooms are tight, but many hotels in London have the same issue. Certainly the room was clean, and very quiet which was appreciated after our long days. We ate a few times at The Swan Pub right next door and loved it - friendly, warm place where we all ate, dinner for three at under $40 with the recent exchange rates. I chose this hotel because I wanted a place far from the noise of downtown London, yet convenient to everything by tube. I also wanted breakfast included in the rate. All in all, it was exactly what I wanted. I would definitely go back."
106,662,"Feb 2 2009 	A great location in central London	I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park at two different times, one on a group trip and the other on a solo trip, but both times had similarly positive experiences. The first time I had a twin room, which I shared with another fellow who was in my group. Room was a bit confined, but enough room to get around. Room was clean, bathroom was functional but not particularly roomy, and bed was comfortable. The second time, I had a nice room, which had a double bed, and it came with a more spacious bathroom and room in general. This bed was very comfortable.Any hotel in London is going to be expensive, as this is one of the world's costliest cities. However, for the money, I found the Corus Hyde Park to be a good value, relatively speaking. The lobby is nice and spacious, but the breakfast is not exactly what I consider to be a great deal, for the price that they ask for it. They do have a nice bar in the lobby with a nice selection of beer on draft, and the concierge is very friendly and knowledgeable as far as getting around. There is a great pub located directly next door, The Swan, and they have great fish and chips, a huge assortment of draft beer, and upstairs they have a fellow who is very entertaining and plays the piano most evenings. Past the Swan, which is a historic spot in London (see plaque on right side of building), is the Lancaster Gate Tube station, which is located on the Central Line of the Underground. The hotel is also located near several city bus stops. Right across Bayswater Road is Hyde Park and the Serpentine, which is great for an early morning walk, which my girlfriend and I took and enjoyed. About a 15 minute walk down Bayswater Road, towards West London, you run into Queensway, which is a street full of all sorts of shops, restaurants, a casino, an ice skating rink, and several department stores, and if you need to pick up any last minute souvenirs for anywhere in the UK, Queensway is your spot, some pretty good shopping and bargains to be found.All in all, this is a decent hotel, not to be mistaken for the Ritz, but it treated me well both times I was there and the location is hard to beat as far as being located within arm's reach of everything in London."
107,662,"Jan 26 2009 	Pleasant stay at Corus Hyde Park	I didn't get around to reading other Trip Advisor reviews (which are mixed in opinion) until after I had booked, but I needn't have worried. The location is fantastic - close to the tube, Hyde Park, restaurants. Also close to Paddington St -I dragged my suitcase for the the short walk to the hotel after arriving on the Heathrow Express train. I stayed in a single room and knew in advance it wouldn't be huge. I was pleased with the clean and tidy room that had space for a desk, and also a fold-out ironing board. Staff were friendly, although service was a bit slow in the restaurant. The continental breakfast was disappointingly small (cereal, few slices of cold meat and cheese, and the only bread were some small rolls), but in my case it was included in the room price.  I'd be happy to stay there again."
108,662,"Jan 24 2009 	Used to be better	I've written good reviews about the Corus in the past and had found it to be clean, comfortable and with good service. After a break from traveling for work I returned and actually was rather disappointed to find the Corus has downgraded in a few small ways which add up to a mediocre stay. I shan't be asking to stay here again."
109,662,"Jan 22 2009 	What a Dump	Had the hotel stay from hell in this kip last weekend. Arrived late (approx 10.45) on Friday evening. Booked through lastminute and had a copy of my conf. email. According to reception I had no booking. Couldn't understand because in addition to my conf. mail I had emailed the hotel telling them I would be a late check in and recieved a reply telling me I could check in anytime after 2.30pm?!?So, we booked fresh, a double room. We were sent to the most ghastly room I have ever seen. A double room in a 4 star hotel with the bed against the wall, and the fresh, strong scent of nightclub ashtray. Disgusting. No other double but could have better twin. Bad news when away with girlfriend. Room was Blue!?? 1970's chic, with a filthy carpet, filthy torn chairs, 2 beds, one bedside lamp, 20 year old tv with bad reception.Tried to get lastminute to sort out problem on Sat morning- they told me they had mailed a cancellation notice(sat unopened in my mailbox, it arrived just before conf. mail). After that they didn't want to know. Customer Service. It simply does not exist with that type of company or this kind of hotel which exists for unsuspecting visitors to London who don't realise that they are being had.Met duty manager on Sun at checkout. He couldn't have been more unhelpful. My problem at this stage was that I booked through lastminute for 170 euros total, and they wanted 230. Because you've given a card on check in you are wasting your breath making your case, the manager told me to take it up with lastminute, like it or lump it."
110,662,Jan 22 2009 	Wonderful Hotel	This hotel is wonderful. We stayed here for eight nights and enjoyed every min. of our stay. The room was very clean and quiet with a nice bathroom. We had a window over looking the street and Hyde Park. The staff at this hotel were all very friendly and went out of their way to assist us. The breakfast was very enjoyable each morning at a table overlooking Hyde Park. Anyone visiting the greatest city in the world would enjoy their stay at this hotel.
111,662,"Jan 20 2009 	Worst staff ever.	This has to be by far the poorest hotel I have ever stayed in, and for one reason only - the staff. The daytime staff were ok, although Giovanni at Concierge was rude and it seemed deliberately unhelpful whatever the time was. The night staff it appeared hadn't been trained in either customer service or, how to even be just plain polite. Asking if there was room service after midnight was like trying to get blood out of a stone - the night staff just cant be bothered. Although it is apparently possible to get baguettes through the night if one wishes, when asked for, one certainly does not get, as the reception staff reply with , &quot;I no understand.&quot; Many conversations were had with reception staff in plain, simple english - all my wife and I wanted after a night out at the theatre was to come back, have a sandwich and go to bed. When I rung down to reception and ordered 2 cheddar and pickle sandwiches, the man's reply was &quot;We got no cheddar.&quot; So we ordered the next thing on the menu - a feta cheese. the reply: &quot;we got no feta&quot; . So again, we ordered the next - a ham and pickle. &quot;we got no ham or pickle.&quot; I then said - so what do you have in stock then? The reply &quot;I no understand.&quot; So after deciding it was less stress to have nothing at all, we went to bed. We were disturbed by who I can only imagine was the same man from downstairs, knocking at our door. My husband got up, answered the door, and the man came into our room, uninvited, asking what we were going to order. We explained we hadnt ordered anything, and it seemed they had nothing downstairs anyway. &quot;But you rang. You must order something or I will have to do a report.&quot; A report on what? I asked. &quot;On the sandwich you ordered!&quot; I told him we hadnt ordered anything at which point he turned around and said &quot;i dont understand&quot;. I asked him to leave our room, at which point he refused and did nothing, just stood there. I dont know if he was waiting for a tip (?!) but I had to basically usher him out of our room. Disgusting behaviour. I went down to reception the next morning and spoke to Jackie, a duty manager,. who was also just as rude, ignorant and untrained as her night colleague. Her exact response to my account of the previous night was &quot;well if you dont like it, check in somewhere else! you have a problem with the way a member of staff treats you, file a complaint against them, not the hotel!!&quot; Ridiculous! Definitely the worst hotel I have EVER stayed at, hardly slept at all, and as someone who has worked in customer service for 22 years, I KNOW that a LOT of the staff there should be fired for sackable offences, and not maintaining even the most basic levels of customer service and manners. The manager there (who was never available when asked for) needs hauling over the coals."
112,662,"Jan 14 2009 	Noisey	This was out second stay at the hotel and will probably be the last. First stay was great, in a standard room. The second stay we upgraded to a duluxe room and this was a big mistake.The room was ok but the bathroom was in need of a good clean and modernisation. It seemed dirty and it was tiny.The TV was broken and when we turned it on it was set on full volume! Not the best way to find out at 10.30 at night. The pipes had an air lock in them so all night there was the most awful noise (like a ship horn) every few hours. The location of the hotel is great, close to everything, Hyde Park, Oxford Street and a tube station but I am sure there are other without all the hassles we experienced."
113,662,"Jan 6 2009	Wonderful time at the Corus	We had a great stay at the Corus hotel. it was a quick and easy check-in with friendly staff, our room was comfortable and clean and definately big enough for 3 adults. It was in a good location, across the road from Hyde Park, not a long walk from Oxford Street and the underground was only a few mins walk away. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. No complaints at all, would definately stay here again."
114,662,"Jan 4 2009 	Tiny tiny tiny	The location is perfect, two minutes walk from Lancaster Gate underground station, but the room, double bed, was extremely small! Yes, it was clean and the bathroom was brand new but the walls were thin enough to hear everything happening on our floor. Long, long queues for breakfast, which was not something special and though it was prepaid we skipped it several times, in order not to lose the day."
115,662,"Dec 19 2008 	Mixed feelings	We stayed four nights at the Corus Hotel in September 08. We found the location to be very conventient, very close to Lancaster Gate tube station and also walking distance (10-15mins) to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express. We found the hotel and our room to be very clean. We used the concierge service a number of times and they were very helpful and quite friendly, although one time we got a man that did not communicate very well in English. The room was small, but when in London you don't spend a lot of time in your room, so we found this to be ok. The biggest issue was having space for all of our luggage as we were travelling around for quite a long time and had accumulated quite a lot along the way. Our stay included continental breakfast, which we found to be very average. There were very few options for breakfast."
116,662,"Dec 15 2008 	Fine Hotel at a Good Location	I stayed here for work in November, after I stayed in another hotel (Shaftesbury Premier Hotel Paddington London) for work in October. I would rate this hotel as much better than the Shaftesbury, because the rooms are far more spacious, there is more light in the rooms and the bathroom actually had a bath. Rooms were clean, no complaints there.Moreover, the enterance with reception, restaurant and bar was excellent. Staff was all very friendly and helpful. The location was perfect, next to Hide Park and very close to the underground. The neighbourhood is fine, altough not the place where you have many bars/restaurant/nightlife, it is a quiet neighbourhood.On my last day, I tried the continental breakfast for the first time. This was a big disappointment (although I don't know how the English Breakfast was). Very little to choose from, definetely not worth the money. It was better to get a muffin or sandwich at any caf.Basically, this hotel delivered everything you would expect from such a class of hotel. Although it is not cheap, but then again nothing in London is. It is a reasonable price for London standards. Therefore I would certaintly recommend this to anybody else."
117,662,"Dec 7 2008 	Tiny Room Rude Receptionist Paper Thin Walls	We stayed here for one night and tried to book originally by turning up at reception.The receptionist told us on arrival that they had no rooms left at all, I said I had seen some on the internet and she told me that this was not the case.I made a phone call to the hotel and booked a room over the phone. I then returned to reception and hey presto they now had a room available for me, and internet people said there was &quot;loads&quot; of availability!!We booked an executive suite in this supposed 4 star hotel. The room is under a 2 star and is no way an executive suite. It was tiny, old run down bathroom with a door half the size of a normal door. The bed was very old, the mattress was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on with broken springs in it.On minor points the hotel website mentions that the executive suites come with LCD Television (we had a tiny old TV with terrible reception and no remote), water (1 small bottle to share between 2). The bed covers are scratchy and old (no duvet) there are wires hanging out of the walls and the ceilings are so low it feels very claustrophobic.I would never recommend this hotel, and for the same money in London (we paid 169 not including breakfast) there are plenty of far superior hotels. I have had better experiences in Hostels! Never stay here!!!!"
118,662,"Nov 21 2008 	great stay	we stayed here for 3 nights, the room was clean, a bit small but we were not in the room other than at night, we had our 8 month old baby with us, staff were excellent, all very friendly, hotel location was great, tube 2 minute walk, swan pub next door nice and friendly, we walked through hyde park to harrods which only took 30 mins, and also walked to oxford street which took about 30 mins,breakfast was fine, good selection, we ate in the hotel 1 night it was great and staff couldn't have done enough, ordered room service dinner which had a 5 tray charge, same as any hotel we hav ever been in, no complaints, great value for money in london,"
119,662,"Nov 19 2008 	Distinctly average and Costly	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in early Nov. We were allowed to check in early and the front desk were very helpful, but the gave us a small cupboard with 2 single beds! Im so glad when we went back down to reception they changed it for us, as there would have been no room for both our suitcases!We were given a double room, and told it wasnt a smoking room, but as we had booked a smoking room, we were told that would be ok. I dont know how non-smokers would feel about this.The room was small with only room to move around if someone was sitting on the bed. The bathroom, was extra small, with one not being able to move from toilet to shower without closing the door. The room was eye level clean in that all the noticable places were clean, on closer inspection it was dusty and the carpet could have done with a hoover. and the blind was held up with velcro, with a huge gap which kind of defeated the purpose.Decent storage space regarding the room size, and tea/coffee facillities were in the room, No ironing board and iron though.its my advice NOT to order room service, after a long day my bf and I ordered dinner at around 9pm. 2 steak and chips was really overpriced, and the food definately sub-standard, had i been in a restaurant, i would have complained, and im not really a complainer. Just trying to leave a fair review.the lobby is nice and most of the staff are too. But you will pay for absolutely everything in this hotel, which i dont think is great considering its rating. You are allowed to leave your bags free of charge though with the concierge which is great if you have a late flight and are checking out early like we did.My advice is if your not happy with the room, ask to be moved, dont order room service, and dont let the impressive lobby fool you, its fairly average."
120,662,"Nov 17 2008 	room was tiny !	the hotel was lovely, staff very friendly and helpful. breakfast was good - although we were told that 'full english' and 'continental' were served in 2 separate rooms!! the only downside was the size of our bedroom and bathroom - you couldnt swing a cat! there was barely room at one side of the bed to walk to the bathroom without hitting off the shelf were the tv was. we didnt mind about the bedroom as we were only staying for 1 night and it was spotless clean and the bed comfortable. we were on the 5th floor and the walls of the bathroom were slopped [attic like]. it was impossible to have a proper shower - once the shower curtain was closed, there was a width of about 12&quot; to shower in.. but as the shower head was in the corner, overhead bath on the slopped wall, you couldn't actually stand under it, due to the shape of the bath. if we had been staying more than 1 night, i would have asked to be moved to a different room."
121,662,"Nov 15 2008 	Fawlty Towers in London?	We were booked in at this &quot; supposedly &quot; 4 star hotel to attend an awards ceremony at the Hilton Park Lane Hotel.All accommodation was paid for in advance to include full English breakfast. When we arrived we were asked for our credit card as the room needed to be paid for before we could have it.We showed them all the paperwork regarding the booking but were still informed that the room was not paid for. We had to contact the company who organised the booking in order to get it sorted out.The room was a twin, but was the smallest room we have ever been in, with both beds against a wall, with a space between them which would only allow one person at a time to be there. However it was clean, and reasonably comfortable, if very basic, with no storage space except for one small hanging rail. The bathroom was tiny and anyone of a larger stature would have struggled to use it. On arrival for breakfast the following morning we were informed that this was not included in our booking, despite being on the booking arrangements. After a trip back to the room to get the paperwork this was then sorted out with reception. The food left a lot to be desired. The eggs were like bullets, and the rest was barely edible. Not what you would expect from a hotel of this standard.The only good service we received was from the Concierge, Jean, who was excellent and could not have been more helpful, and was also extremely polite and amenable.I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone."
122,662,"Nov 5 2008 	Think I got one of the better rooms......	Booked this as one of the 'mystery' hotels on Lastminute, purely on price. It's at a pretty good location but the place is looking tatty around the edges - frayed carpets and flaking paint in the rooms.It's also one of those irritating places where they charge for absolutely everything - WiFi? Extra. Forgotten a razor? Pay for it. Breakfast in your room? That's a fiver please....I actually got a decent-sized room, but there was a woman in reception complaining loudly about the size of her 'cupboard' sized room. I did see a few of the others as they were being cleaned this morning and they were teeny - even the doors are smaller!"
123,662,Nov 3 2008 	Don't Eat at this Hotel go next door to The Swan Pub	While the Corus Hyde Park is well situated to Hyde Park the food left a lot to be desired! 22 for a very tough sirloin steak even I found hard to swallow! But the Swan Pub just left around the corner does wonderful steaks for 9!! Plus really friendly service no matter what time of the day I went in I skipped the Corus breakfasts as well and had the full English Breakfast at the Swan along with dinner at night.The 50 surcharge for a later checkout time I thought was excessive overall the Corus was comfortable and clean. Not sure I'd stay there again though.
124,662,"Oct 22 2008 	Disappointed	Fortunately I stayed here at someone else's expense. For an expensive hotel I expected more than average standards of service - in particular, only 8 Freeview channels on the TV, fag burns on the bedside table and the films on the TV failed.Staff were fine, and I can't say the room was uncomfortable. But it just lacked the edge that you expect for 200 a night."
125,662,"Oct 21 2008 	Convenient	We'd stayed at the Cumberland Hotel last year near Marble Arch, but this year, needed something a little more affordable at the last minute. The Corus Hotel Hyde Park ended up being a decent option for the week stay. The location was great -- as mentioned in other reviews, very close to the Lancaster Gate tube stop.Upon arrival, they provided us an upgrade to a &quot;larger room&quot; which was still small by American standards, but sufficient by London standards. We didn't plan to spend much time in the hotel room, so it was fine for our needs.A full hot English breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, fresh fruit, etc.) was included in the price, so that was a great bonus. I'm uncertain why they had 2 breakfasts offered -- one continental and one full English.The location really can't be beat. If you're not looking for luxury, but need a clean, convenient, affordable and safe place to stay, then the Corus Hotel Hyde Park is a great choice."
126,662,"Oct 16 2008 	Convenient Location Nice Accomodations	We stayed at Corus Hyde Park for three nights from September 30, 2008 through October 3, 2008 on a trip to London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We booked with British Airways Holidays and got the room for a bargain of $426 total for three nights ($142 per night).The lobby was nice, using mirrored walls to make it seem spacious. It featured modern furnishing and two computers with internet access (I think we paid a pound for 15 minutes).The hotel is very convenient to the Lancaster Gate tube station and only a 10 minute walk to Paddington. When leaving the Lancaster Gate Tube station, turn right, cross the street, then take your first right, after &quot;The Swan&quot; pub. &lt; 5 min walk.The first day we arrived we wandered through Hyde Park and found we were also only a 15 minute walk to Knightsbridge.The hotel rooms were small, as expected in London, with modern, simplistic furnishing. It appeared to have been renovated within the past 5 years. Our room was on the 6th floor and had a view of the back alleyway. There was some noise at night, garbage bins in the back alley, but that is expected in the city. We had everything we need, including a flat screen TV and a shower with great water pressure. We also had tea and tasty ginger biscuits in our room. Our rate included breakfast daily. It was a nice spread, including juice, coffee, tea, cereal, croissants, rolls, cheese, deli meat, granola, yogurt, etc...We had drinks at the bar one night and the bartender was pleasant and accommodated our strange American mixed drink requests.I would stay here again. Not the nicest hotel in London, but a good bargain, nicer than I expected."
127,662,"Oct 10 2008 	Corus Hyde Park - Not quite what it seems	If you hear the word upgrade from any of the staff, please ignore them. I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park for two days in October paid for by my employer.I had booked a standard double room but when I got to the hotel they advised that all double standard rooms had been booked so they would upgrade me to a twin single room. It was hardly an upgrade just standard small room with two single beds. In fairness they had advised that as a gesture of good will, wait for it, they would upgrade me to a superior double room the day after.The day after, they put me in what was supposedly a superior double room which once again appeared very standard.There was no bottled water in my room but there was water in the room next door occupied by my colleague.The Corus website stated that all bedrooms had large flat screen TVs but both rooms I stayed in had standard 19 CRT TVsAvoid staying on level one as this is infact the basement, avoid staying on level two as this infact the ground floor. Both of these floors had poor views and a lot of street noise.We ordered Mohitos from the bar which were the worst Mohitos I had ever tasted. The hotel restaurant was empty on both days I was there &amp; when I tasted the food I realised why. The presentation of the food was awful, the chips seemed to have been cooked in old oil, the Malaysian food was limited in choice and not very appetising. The restaurant was also very cold as it was incorporated into a conservatory structure. The physical hotel, furniture, carpets etc was visibly suffering from wear &amp; tear.I would not stay at this hotel again. The only positive thing abut the Corus hotel was that it was close to Lancaster Gate tube station, Hyde park was across the road and there was a decent pub next door."
128,662,"Oct 10 2008 	You can do better	We stayed at the hotel for one night to attend a function nearby and had it not been for the exellent location for that specific event, we would have been very very disappointed.The room has to be the smallest I have ever stayed in, so small in fact that 2 people have to move around the room very carefully to avoid bumping into each other and all the extras one would expect in a 4 star hotel are there, but on a very small scale. It really feels a very cramped environement, with unomfortable beds.Shop around to get a decent sized room if you can, otherwise prepare for the doll's house experience"
129,662,"Oct 5 2008 	Small Room - Excellent Location	We stayed for two nights in October 2008, for a short break in London. We chose the Hotel mainly on price  and it transpired to be good value.The location is ideal  close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate Tube Station. It was an easy walk across the gardens to the Albert Hall. The down side was the size of the room  it was very small and dark, because it was facing a wall - we had a twin room and there was just enough space between the beds for one person and each bed was against a wall. However, the biggest problem was the lack of storage space. There was a small hanging rail with a shelf above it and that was it. No drawers for underwear or any other items. There was, however, a safe (always useful). The carpet could do with cleaning.The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels (replaced daily) but it was small with (again) no shelves for personal toiletries.We paid extra for breakfast (12.50 for English). The food was freshly prepared and there was plenty available. The coffee was just average though  no Decaff, only instant.In summary a convenient place to stay in London, as long as you dont have to stay in the room for any longer than necessary."
130,662,"Oct 4 2008 	Good value for money in a Great Location	I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel near Hyde Park for a one night business trip. I spent an hour or so looking at all the small hotels under 100 in the area (both their websites and trip advisor) and concluded that i'd only get a B&amp;B that resembled student accomodation. Nothing wrong with that, but I wanted somewhere that was going to guarantee comfort, cleanliness and good service. I opted for the Corus Hotel standard room for 120 and got exactly what I'd asked for. The check in staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel lobby was nicely designed and modern. The room was indeed small but very well designed, clean and with a comfortable bed.I arrived at 8pm tired and just wanted to spend a night watching TV, so I ordered room service. The food was good and the waiter that brought it to my room was again friendly and helpful.I'd also chosen the hotel for its location. In the morrning, I got up early to run around Hyde Park for half an hour. What a great start to my day, the park is beautiful and packed with historical landmarks. Afterwards it was back to my room for a quick shower and a speedy checkout.In summary, small room but the whole experience was perfectly formed. They do haver larger rooms at higher prices if you're making a longer stay. I'll go back there for more, next time I need a bolt hole in London for the night."
131,662,"Oct 1 2008	Excellent location short on space	This hotel is in a brilliant location, literally minutes from Lancaster Gate Tube station. The exterior is attractive as is the reception and seating area. The room was certainly the smallest we have stayed in in London, but was fine for a one or two night stay. It was very clean and the beds were comfy with nice duvets and pillows. Tea and coffee were provided and it was a change to have good size mugs rather than the usual cups. Shower was powerful and the toiletries provided were good. Air conditioning was efficient and quiet. On the down side there was no drawer space and limited hanging space - no wardrobe just hangers on a rail. Iron, ironing board and trouser press are provided.The staff were all lovely; polite, friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay based on the room we stayed in - don't know if other rooms are more spacious. We got a good deal on the London Town website - I would thoroughly recommend them."
132,662,"Sep 18 2008 	Pleasant modern hotel good location	We stayed at this hotel for one night to attend an event in Hyde Park. Hyde Park is just over the road and Oxford Street and Paddington nearby. We easily got a service bus from Victoria Coach Station to this hotel. The hotel itself is modern and most rooms have been recently renovated. We had one of the recently renovated ones. It was clean and modern with an LCD flat screen TV (with a good reception for once), the room had the usual Tea and Coffee making facilities and an ensuite bathroom and shower with complimentary toiletries and also an ironing board, iron and trousers press which was very useful. It also had air conditioning. The view from our room was over the back of the hotel so not very exciting and the room itself and bathroom were very small for a double. Considerably smaller than a travel lodge room for example. However, it was spotlessly clean and as we were only there for one night it was perfectly adequate for the price that we paid of 95. However, beware that depending on how you book this room it could cost considerably more and I don't think given the size of the room I would have liked to have paid a lot more for it. It is worth shopping around different websites to try and get a good price. I did book direct with the hotel in the end but I think the price went up after as there was a big event on nearby and people started to book the rooms up. The cost of our room didn't include breakfast. Full English breakfast was an additional 12.50 or continental breakfast was available for slightly less. There was a pub next door, The Swan, we didn't eat there but the menu looked good. I would use this hotel again but only if it were for a one night stay."
133,662,"Sep 17 2008 	Great Hotel location	We stayed ta the Corus Hyde Park for one night on Sept 14th and were pleasantly surprised. The location is ideal, 2 blocks from tube and across from Hyde Park. The reception was quite helpful with directions and information, The room (1001 - standard, double bed w/bath) was small but typical of Europe. Clean and plenty of air circulation (your own thermostat) in room safe, etc. The continental breakfast was bread, cold cereal, yogurt, coffee/tea, juice..your basic. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean, centrally located hotel."
134,662,"Sep 13 2008	Friendly and welcoming	We stayed in a twin room for one night in September 2008 and really enjoyed our stay. The reception and especially the concierge were extremely friendly and helpful with every request. The room was a reasonable size, quiet, and very clean and tidy; the bathroom was quite compact though. My only bugbear with this hotel was a lack of decaffinated tea and coffee. When I asked for some to be sent to the room they replenished all the regular tea and coffee instead. Despite this I would definitely stay here again. The location is great, we walked to the hotel from Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube station is a stone's throw away."
135,662,"Sep 4 2008 	Clean modern good deal for the money convenient location	We booked a room at the Corus Hotel Hyde Park as part of a larger vacation package. There were several hotel choices available, but after considering price and reading previous Trip Advisor reviews, we chose this hotel. We were not disappointed! Granted, the rooms were a bit on the small side, but that will be true nearly anywhere in London. The biggest peeve we had with room size is that it seemed like the bed was unnecessarily pushed up against one wall -- there was space to center it more in the room, but a built-in nightstand prevented this. Regardless, my 6'4&quot; husband and I slept well. The bathroom was also quite tiny, but with room enough for one person. Considering there was a desk/dressing table in the room, this was not an issue for getting ready in the morning.To address the noise concern: we were on the 7th floor, facing Lancaster Gate -- a road, but admittedly the more quiet of the two that the hotel sits on the corner of. When the built-in shades were open, yes, there was some white road noise. But it was remarkably muted just by closing the shade. All light was blocked out too -- a blessing and a curse since there was no alarm clock in the room and no sunlight to wake us up.The buffet breakfast was decent. Not the best we've had, but certainly enough to give a good start to the day. It was included in our stay, but I'm not sure how much extra I would have paid for it.Staff was friendly, concierge was a godsend. The location was great, too -- just a minute or two to the nearest tube station. Granted, most tourist attractions were to the east of the hotel, but that made it easy to know which direction to head on the tube! Hyde Park is literally across the street, Kensington Palace and Gardens are minutes away. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay here. We would recommend it to other travelers and would stay here again, should we return to London."
136,662,Aug 28 2008	loved the location	we booked a cruise with 2 nights at a hotelthis is the place we gotit was a nice place rooms were clean the location was the best easy to get to buses and walk in hyde pkwould stay againcarol
137,662,"Aug 24 2008 	Good location decent rooms but a bit noisy!	Booked this hotel for a two night stay combining some sightseeing with my mum, with some business meetings. Reception was welcoming and let us check in to our rooms an hour early. Concierge service advised us on the best way to get cheap theatre tickets and looked after our luggage during our last day sightseeing.We stayed in a twin room on the ground floor, which was small but fine by London standards. The room was clean with efficient and quiet air conditioning which is important in the summer! The beds were comfy and the bathroom was a good size with good shower and a bath. One significant problem with the room was that it overlooked the lane to the side of the hotel where the delivery entrance is located. On the first morning we were woken at around 6am by a lorry unloading, but it moved on quickly and we went back to sleep. On the second morning, however, the deliveries began at 6am and went on till after 9am. The delivery people were not quiet - shouting and slamming doors. We didn't get any more sleep that morning! When we complained on checking out, the receptionist said all the rooms are double glazed, but if the noise bothered us we should have asked to have been moved. We pointed out that our room was single glazed and that it is hardly practical to ask to be moved since the problem started at 6am! We didn't receive an apology, and the receptionist pointed out that the hotel had to have deliveries. He also continued to insist the room was double glazed, and seemed to think we were at fault since we hadn't asked to be moved!We had the continental buffet breakfast twice, which was fine but on the second day we ate towards the end of service when a lot of foods had disappeared (no cold meats left) and you had to wait ages to get clean cups or hot water for tea.The location of the hotel is excellent, moments away from Lancaster Gate underground (central) and across the road from Hyde Park. I was able to get to Westminster for work in around 20 minutes during rush hour."
138,662,"Aug 16 2008 	good location good foodexecutve room just ok	Stayed for 4 nights and booked an Executive suite. Room size was ok, so a bit disappointed, noise outside was bad, one window tat could not stay open unless I pushed a piece of paper in,but that made noise outside worse so had to close it after one sleepless night. We used a fan instead which made it bearable as the aircon did not seem to do anything except hum.Bed were comfortable,bathroom adequate with plenty of towels and a hairdryer. Small portable tv with only 6 channels. I did look at two other rooms,room 1025 was superb, with fitted wardobe,shower cubicle and seem to be newly decorated with lots of space and very quiet unfortunately had a double bed,other room was even smaller than the one I had. breakfast was fine when i came down early, if a bt late there was a long queue.I had paid for the english breakfast but you also have the choice of contnental. I asked for room service 3 times for my daughter as she preferred to have a lie-in,but except for one time,she did not get any even when I went down to ask, I had to take some bread rolls for her myself in the end. Good location, bus 94 goes to oxford street and stop oposite hotel if you get fed up with the tube.Staff was helpful. Hotel was very clean and I may come back again if i get a discount not full rate."
139,662,Aug 13 2008 	Good location near the tube and west End	The hotel is close to the west end and within walking distance of a number of great restaurants in Bayswater / Queensway. Check in was quick and friendly and my room spotlessly clean. The room was very compact and the bathroom tiny. However for one night it was fine and the bed was very comfortable. The bar area and reception were informal and comfortable and bar and bistro prices were both very reasonable. Breakfast was ok with a fair selection of dishes. Mine was included in the price but I dont think it was worth the 12 if you had to pay for it on top of the room rate.
140,662,Aug 11 2008 	Great Hotel	I've just come back from 2 nights in London and we stayed at the Corus hotel. We had a slight problem when we checked in (they said our booking was for 2 days later) however once I showed them my confirmation they quickly sorted it out and found us 2 rooms next to each other (which we had asked for).I think the rooms were the executive rooms and they were very spacious and well decorated. A few of the other reviews said the rooms were very warm however ours had air conditioning however we never needed to put it on. The reception and bar areas were very nice and all the staff were very friendly.We had the full English Breakfast and it was lovely - lots of choice and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table.The hotel was located just by Lancaster Gate tube station which was great for getting around. Overall we had a great stay and I wouldn't hesitate to go back there.
141,662,"Aug 5 2008 	Great location lovely decor great staff	'My partner and I, with our 8 year old son, stayed at the Corus Hyde Park hotel in august 2008. The location was perfect, with Lancaster Gate station a minutes walk away and on the Central Line, and the scenic Hyde Park just across the street. The hotel`s interior was top class too and we really felt we got more for our money staying here, than we would have staying in some of the well-known chain hotels. We stayed in a family room and when I saw the room from the outside I paniced slighty as it looked a bit like a store cupboard, with elevators on either side of it, but once inside, these worries disappeared as it was spacious and the decor was modern, clean and stylish. My son`s bed was separate from ours, with the bathroom in the middle, so he felt a bit like he had his own room, which was good. He was especially impressed with the &quot;green&quot; lighting in the bathroom (the dimmed version), and the wall mounted tv, pretty decent hairdryer, kettle and handy ironing board were all great. I have to say the hotel staff were all extremely pleasant also, without it being &quot;put on&quot;. They seemed to work in a happy environment, which you don`t always get in hotels. My son again especially loved that when we came back to our room at night, those who had cleaned it, had laid all his toys and teddies out on his bed for him. This was a nice touch. The full engish breakfast was great too, with a choice of hot foods, and cereals etc. We had a small wait one morning for breakfast (15mins max) but the hotel had left a note in our room to let us know that as they were particularly busy that weekend, that they expected a wait at breakfast and advised guests to come a bit earlier if they were in a hurry. Again this was a nice touch and although the hotel was very busy, it never felt that way. Even though we were right beside the lifts, I don`t recall ever being disturbed by them, the three nights we stayed. Overall the hotel had a great feel to it, very calm, spacious and friendly. I never usually write reviews but the length of this one should show how impressed I was by the hotel!"
142,662,Aug 3 2008 	What small rooms for a 4*	Stayed for 1 night at end of July - glad it was only 1 night as the room was the smallest I have stayed in ever! The window opened onto an inner courtyard and as there was no air conditioning this had to be open. There was no air to come in through the small gap of window and we were subject to the chatter and clatter of hotel workers drifting up to us into the small hours. What a shame...lobby and reception area plus outside of hotel are lovely but the room really let it down.
143,662,Jul 25 2008 	Lost a stone as no air con!!	The hotel's appearance was lovely-great reception and lobby and the breakfasts were great. the room was approx 10 feet by 6 feet no window to open and no air con!! we could not sleep in the heat. staff were most unhelpful and on 2 occasions on a 3 day stay we witnessed staff arguments.
144,662,"Jul 18 2008 	Shabby and outdated	I stayed at this hotel on business recently. Yes, the Corus Hyde Park has a lovely reception area and friendly staff which is nice but isn't the accommodation quite important too? I noticed that the hotel will recently complete upgrading the air conditioning of rooms which I can imagine will ease the high room temperature being that the windows open only a couple of inches. The glamorous reception and friendly staff were overshadowed by the outdated and shabby double room I stayed in. The bedspread was full of holes and the brown with blue tartan carpet looked filthy - something not of this decade! The surface of the bath around the plughole was cracked and stained so no baths taken here! On the plus side, the breakfast was nice, that is, if it is included in the price of the stay. Otherwise it is 11.50 which I suppose is average for London. I have found unfortunately that this is a not uncommon feature of hotels in central London - they look great from the outside but ultimately they let you down."
145,662,"Jul 12 2008	Great Hotel with awsome service! and perfect location.	I stayed at the Corus hotel on my last visit to London and I highly recommend it to any traveller who wants to stay in a central location, as the hotel is a quick two minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube station which is on the red, central line. This offers easy access to all of Londons top locations. If you arrive at Heathrow, the Heathrow exspress takes you from the airport to Paddington station in 15 minutes and then a taxi ride is a quick five minutes to the hotel and should not cost more then 5 pounds.The rooms are a little small but one can expect that from London hotels, if you want a bigger room you going to pay a large amount at another hotel, and for what when you not going to spend that much time in the room. Even know the rooms are a little small they come with all the facilieties one would need for a pleasent stay. A BIG plus of the hotel is the service, my sister became very sick during our stay and the hotel was unbelievable in helping out! I Would like to thank all the staff for helping out! I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to visit London and want to know they are in good hands!"
146,662,"Jul 8 2008 	Clean and central	An extremely clean post-modern interior at this hotel which is on the edge of Hyde Park in London.We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist, even though we had just walked from Victoria Station and probably looked a little dishevelled and hot!Our room was small, but adequate, and very clean. As ever we were overlooking the bins and kitchen door below - but that's just our luck!Breakfast the next morning was full English and served in the basement restaurant, with plenty to choose from at a serve yourself bar.The bar was very busy late at night (probably as the local boozer The Mitre shut at 11pm because it is a residential area).The highlight of the stay though was without doubt our trip to see Morrissey at the 02 festival in Hyde Park, which is just a 10 minute walk away.Highly recommended."
147,662,"Jul 6 2008 	Good Hotel Well Located	Just returned from a 2 night stay at Corus Hyde Park Hotel, London. Booked this hotel after much research on Trip Advisor and it didnt disappoint. The hotel is in a great location beside Hyde Park and less that 2 mins from Lancaster Gate tube station. It is ideal for visiting the main London attractions. The lobby and bedroom were spotless, double room was small but well equipped and adequate for a short stay. Had the continental breakfast one morning which was par for the course - english breakfast pricey. Overall my view of Corus Hyde Park is very positive and would have no hesitation in returning."
148,662,"Jul 2 2008 	No complaints - GREAT location!	I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park for 3 nights with a friend. We are 2 girls traveling together, and felt completely safe at the hotel. We had two twin beds with a small nighstand to seperate the beds. Of course the room was a tad small, and the bathroom was tiny, but, this is Europe - much different than US standards. We absolutely loved the location, and the staff were super friendly! The tube is just a few blocks away, and the &quot;Swan&quot; pub is right around the corner - GREAT location!We loved London, and loved our stay at the Corus - would recommend for anyone looking for a good deal in a great, safe location!"
149,662,"Jun 24 2008 	Well located but very small 	Stayed here for 1 night on 21st June 2008, was part of a group of 9 on a Hen night.I stayed in a twin room with another girl, the room was tiny, smaller than most &quot;Travelodge&quot; style rooms and the bathroom was even smaller, was not comfortable for the 2 of us trying to get ready for a night out.The location of the hotel is pretty good, along the Bayswater Road, directly opposite Hyde Park and a very short walk from Lancaster Gate tube or a 10-15minute walk from Queensway.Black cabs seemed to pass the hotel frequently and a cab into the Covent Garden area on a Saturday evening cost us about 15The common areas of the hotel were clean and well presented and the staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough to help (Which included the concierge man giving his pizza to 4 very drunken girls..us.. at 4am haha). The bar stayed open until about 3am, after which you could order drinks from the concierge... as with any hotel, the drinks were expensive.The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing to write home about but if its included in your rate then you may aswell have it. Breakfast is served until 10.30am and check out is 11am.If I had to would I stay here again...... possibly, I personally think it was quite expensive, 120 for a double and 140 for a triple... having said that the triple rooms were VERY large and worth the extra 20 for sure, the 9 of us all ended up getting ready in the triple room and having drinks there before we headed out.My 3 main complaints and warnings about the hotel would be...1 - The rooms are VERY hot, you can open a small window but they are very stiff and would need 2 people to open them.2 - The bath is built over some kind of ledge and there are signs warning you to watch your head, needless to stay you dont think of that when you step into the shower and 5 out of 9 of us had very sore heads where we had hit them on the ledge. The bath/shower is also very small and not that comfortable.3 - The hotel is on a road that is classed as a &quot;Business Permit&quot; road from 8.30am - 8.30pm and there is no drop off bay so be very careful, my boyfriend dropped me off, helped me up the stairs with my bag, was literally 2-3 minutes and was greeted with a whopping great 60 car parking ticket!!"
150,662,"Jun 20 2008 	Small but almost perfectly formed	I stayed at the Corus Hyde Park for 1 night on a business trip. I was in a single room on the 9th floor. The room was tiny, but it was well laid out and there was a fair bit of floor space considering the size. The desk was ample size. There was not much storage space although it was fine for one night. The bathroom was also small but for one person it was adequate. If there were two people in the room then it would be way too small but then it was only a single.Breakfast was OK, I was there at 7am and it had not all all been put out yet but was definitely fresh!The staff were very helpful and the whole place seemed very clean.I thought the location was good for Oxford street, it's a 10/15 minute walk away along the side of Hyde Park. Very close to Lancaster Gate tube station.I'd have no problems with staying there again."
151,662,"Jun 7 2008 	Small rooms but comfortable with good location	I had stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago, and had to go to London on business again, so thought I'd see if it had changed. The hotel is very conveniently situated a couple of hundred yards from Lancaster Gate tube (Central line) which has excellent connections to central London. If there are any problems on the Central line, there is another tube station about five minutes walk away. There is a good pub next door (which serves decent food), and also a corner shop that stocks most essentials.A good point is the friendly Hotel Concirge, who will hail taxis and provide useful local information. All the staff are extremely pleasant (although I didn't meet one who was British) and helpful. There was no problem with check-in or -out, both of which were speedy and efficient.The rooms are small, but well thought-out. I had an ironing board (with integral iron), portable fan (the rooms are warm, but are all having air-conditioning installed by this August), and a good flat-screen TV. The window could be opened, but only with a struggle. Another feature that I appreciated (and was surprised to find in a hotel of this quality) was a refreshment tray. This had kettle, teas/coffee/biscuits etc. The bed was comfy, and the blackout from shutters, rather than curtains, was surprisingly effective. There was the usual gripe about soundproofing between rooms not being very good, and there was no lock on the bathroom door, but that was about all for the accommodation.It is possible to book either continental or full English breakfast (the difference is about 10), but I didn't feel the quality of the full English would warrant paying this if I stay there again, although there was more than enough of everything. The Lobby is spacious and attractive, with several alcoves to sit and read in, and the bar prices were on a par with the pub next door (or vice versa). Directly across from the hotel are Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park which is great for a stroll."
152,662,"May 28 2008 	Not A Bad Hotel But Definitely Not A Four Star Hotel	stayed at the corus hotel hyde park during march on a trip to london. yes the room was small, enough for 1 person only, since i was solo traveler i didn't have a problem with that, but i can't see 2 people staying in that small room. my room overlooked baywater road, and i found the street to noisy at nite, and i sleep rather deeply. did eat at the breakfast buffet once, thought it was adequate. had a couple drinks at the bar, they had some issues with the register, so drinks were charged to my room. room card wouldn't work once or twice, a new one was issued immediately. since i was traveling during the early spring, the weather was still cool, so the air conditioner wasn't required. but i did sleep with window open several nites for fresh air. the location of the hotel was great, great great. about a block from the lancaster street station. across from hyde park, kensington park is across the steet and down some way. prince albert memorial was within walking distance. so was the science museum, the albert and victoria museum, princess diana memorial, so much within walking distance. the fire alarm did go off during the dead of nite, but something was burning and the fire department came and we were evacuated. overall i think the hotel was decent for the price."
153,662,"May 17 2008 	Awful !!!!!!	The absolute worst hotel experince of my life. The room was smaller than most prison cells. With abnormally hot weather, and no air circulation (and no air conditioners), it was impossible to sleep. The bathroom had a sink smaller than most airline washrooms, a shower that was too low for anyone over 5 foot to stand upright in, the shower nozzle kept sliding down the suppot pole, and by the time you finished trying to clean yourself, you were standing in water halfway to your knees, because the drains didn't work. The furniture and curtains had suffered from years of smoker carelessness, with burns and holes everywhere. The room was sparsely equiped, wih no iron or board, no wardrobe (where would they put it ?) &amp; a small TV mounted in the corner near the ceiling.This is NOT a 3 star hotel. More like a youth hostel from the 60's.We won't be back."
154,662,"May 10 2008 	Expected Better	4 star hotel, so expected better.The breakfast was one of the worst I have ever come across. The continental breakfast which was included in our package was awful. The only fruit was tinned grapefruit or tinned orange segments. There was no fresh fruit. The choice of cereals was limited - just bran flakes, cornflakes and one other type of flakes. Selection of bread was awful and stale. Only juices were orange juice or apple juice. Second morning we brought down our own food and used just the hotel's milk. (Note - I would not be a fussy eater either.)Other thing that was really annoying was that when we arrived, we only had a one night booking, as opposed to the 2 nights I thought we had - my fault, not the hotels and so I booked the next night through the website I had used as was much cheaper than the hotels' price of 125 (without breakfast). Took 3 trips to reception that day and next before reservation was confirmed, even with hotel voucher. And when we arrived back to hotel on 2nd night, room cards did not work and had to go down to reception again! Internet access in lobby, but was 1 for 10 mins - should have been free access - have stayed in a lot of 2 and 3 star hotels and most had free access.all rooms were meant to have air conditioning - ours didnt, all that it had was a fan.Room was small and toilet blocked in our room after one flush - had to get maintenance up to it.Only good thing about this hotel was its central location - was only about 2 / 3 mins from Lancaster Gate tube stationbut there are lots of other hotels in the area and not as pricey as this one!"
155,662,"May 5 2008 	Appalling!	If you want to stay in a good, clean, decent hotel in London, AVOID the Corus Hotel in Hyde Park. Although the lobby makes you think the rooms will be lovely and clean, leave your expectations on the front door step. The Corus Hotel is disgusting. The rooms are the tackiest, dirtiest, old-fashioned rooms in all of London. It is a complete waste of money, and despite the location, it has absolutely nothing else going for it. The rooms are filthy, and the facilities in the room and the hotel are sub-standard. There is no complimentary wireless internet, which is available in every other hotel I have ever stayed in. As a frequent traveller, who has had the opportunity to stay in a number of hotels worldwide, I can honestly tell you that the Corus Hotel in Hyde Park is the worst you will find for the price. The door man is friendly, and once you get through the front door, don't expect to find anyone else who is even remotely helpful, or who understands hospitality. There is one gentleman who works at the concierge desk, who is from South Africa and manages to raise the standards of the place, But, take my advice and stay away from this hotel."
156,662,"May 3 2008 	Not a 4 Star Hotel	The rooms at the Corus Hyde Park are incredibly small. I booked a double and one side of the bed was against the wall! The bathroom door was so narrow that any large person would need to turn sideways to get in.Of course there is no bath in the 'bathroom', only a pokey shower which never seemed to get hot enough.No wardrobe - just a metal frame thing with about 6 hangers on it (for two people!). Ironing boards and hair dryers are just stuck to the wall, and can't be put away. Looks a mess. These are not rooms one would wish to spend much time in.A Four Star Hotel this is not. It barely rates 3 stars in my opinion. The only 4-star features are the location and the room rate.No mini-bar. Poor selection of tea/coffee/biscuits in room.The wall-mounted LCD tv had the sound quality of a tin can.No air conditioning. The room was very hot and it was only possible to open the window in inch or so. A small, noisy fan was the only way of cooling the room.On the plus side (I'm trying hard here) the room was acceptably clean, although the grouting in the shower looked 'tired'.Staff pleasant enough, but distant. Public areas nice enough but bland.The room was reasonably quiet at night given the location on the busy Bayswater road.Fire alarm was going off intermittently in the afternoon with no explanation from staff as to whether this was a test or a real emergency - guests just milled about confused.The location is excellent for west end entertainment, shopping etc.If you want a real 4-star hotel in this area, there are a few to choose from that offer a real 4-star experience and better value for money.Not recommended."
157,662,May 2 2008	ARGHHH!	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night at the end of April and I hope I never have to stay there again. The staff were friendly and the food was actually quite good. However the room was awful. More like a cell it overlooked an alley with noisy airconditioning units stacked almost outsie the window and the skips for empty bottle disposals in the same area that seemed to be being filled all the time. The traffic noise was very loud as well. The double glazing seemed not to work and I spend a noisy evening not being able to work or relax and a noisy night not getting much sleep. Not recommended at all.
158,662,"Apr 25 2008	good hotel great location	I stayed at the corus hotel hyde park in febraury 2008, i travelled with a college trip and they organised the hotel. on first impressions the hotel is very grand, the entrance is made of marble and as you walk up the marble stairs you are greeted at the entrance by a very polite doorman who carried our bags inside. our room was good, its was a little small but for the money i paid it was good value. the room was cleaned every day and the maids did not hassle you to vacate the rooms while they cleaned. The bar area and reception is immaculate and all the staff are very friendly and approachable. food was good i only had breakfast at the hotel but it was really nice, it was served buffet style and there was lots of variety.  The hotel is located directly opposite hyde park and the view form my room over hyde park was amazing. the only problem i had at this hotel was that in the breakfast not many of the staff our english so sometimes it was hard to get what you are asking for, but other than this hotel is very very good."
159,662,"Apr 23 2008	Excellent Choice for London	What a great find!This hotel is aimed at &quot;budget business travellers&quot;. And tho I was there on vacation, it suited me perfectly. This means it was not a luxurious place to hang out. But it was very clean, comfortable, friendly and with a wonderfully active lobbyJust one subway stop past the excitement of Oxford Street, the hotel is also across the street from Hyde Park which allowed me to enjoy everything about the city and introduced me to its wonderful royal parks.The staff was very helpful and eager to please, offering me a choice of three rooms since I was staying for seven days.Concierge, doormen, bar staff, cleaners were all great.My only quibble.. it would have been nice to have a table lamp in the room as the overhead halogens didn't produce a very warm or inviting light. Others have commented on the tiny rooms. But mine was a twin with plenty of room.If you need a comfortable place to stay in London which is affordable for north americans, this is it."
160,662,"Apr 9 2008	Small but perfect	Just spent 2 nights at this hotel. Yes the rooms are small and yes they resemble ship cabins but they are cleverly designed and immaculately clean. All mod cons, hairdryers, ironing board, trouser press, tea/coffee facilties, great shower. Very central location. Get off tube at Lancaster Gate, exit tube station, turn right, 3 mins walk. Would stay there again."
161,662,Apr 8 2008 	Lovely and Clean	We stayed two nights at the Corus Hotel. Lovely clean room staff were very freindly and the English breakfast was very good. Just minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station it was ideal. As we own our own B&amp;B we are very critical of standards. We would stay there again. Sheila and Roy from Sheffield
162,662,"Apr 3 2008	Pokey and Overpriced	Stayed for three nights on business. Room is very small and under- equipped but the bathroom is a joke- you cannot sit on the toilet without putting your feet in the shower. You can hardly turn around in it. There is no storage space for clothes.Walls are too thin and you hear a lot of noise from your neighbours and passages.The lift provision is totally inadequate- on the 4th floor at 9.00am, every lift which stopped was completely full. I suppose this is a result of them having lots of large groups.Not recommended"
163,662,"Mar 31 2008 	Very nice hotel	I looked long and hard for a nice '5 star' type hotel in central london with a budget of 100 for a nights stay for my boyfriends birhday. I finally came across the Corus Hotel which met my budget nicely and although it wasn't a 5 star hotel the pictures I'd seen of it lead me to believe it was going to be more than suitable for a nights stay. I was a little nervous though as it was slighly cheaper compared to many other hotels in that location and some reviews I'd read were quite negative however as soon as I arrived there my worries disappeared. The staff were very friendly on arrival and when I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday our room was upgraded to a room on the sixth room. The room was comfortable, clean and tidy. The deco was alittle dated in the sleeping area but the bathroom was quite modern. The shower was great - very powerful! The rate included continental breakfast which can be served in your room for no extra cost.The location of the hotel for us was alittle away from the west end - 10 min taxi ride or approx 35 mins walk - not great if you're a lady wearing heals. However the views of hyde park from our room were enough for us not to worry about paying extra for taxis to take us everywhere. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a nights stay! Not sure if the room size would be big enough for a full weeks stay but certainly fine for a night or two."
164,662,"Mar 29 2008 	modern but small	the decor in this hotel is lovely but the rooms are small, the bathrooms are the worst, the baths have high sides so hard to climb in and there is a big ledge above your head which makes showering uncomfortable as its possible to keep hitting your head on the ledge whilst washing your hair, the staff are nice and friendly and the food is excellent, its right next to a tube station so getting around is easy. the only thing that lets this hotel down is the bathrooms, and i would say for what you get its a little overpriced, next time i will pay the litttle extra for a marriot hotel which are by far the best"
165,662,"Mar 28 2008 	reasonable and pleasant	I had a single room on the eighth floor for an overnight stay this week. The rate (80) was as good as you get in London unless you are in a Travelodge or Travel Inn, and the location is great - 2 mins from Lancaster Gate tube stop on the Central (red) line. It's across the road from Kensington Gardens/ Hyde Park and a pleasant stroll to Marble Arch and the shops if you prefer walking to the Tube. 10 minutes walk to Paddington Station too.The rate included continental breakfast which they will serve in your room for no extra cost, quite nice for a single traveller.The room had an iron and small ironing board, a very compact but pleasant bathroom, wall mounted flat screen TV. It was all rather spare but not unpleasantly so, and both clean and comfortable."
166,662,"Mar 24 2008 	Corus Hotel an Excellent choice for all!	We arrived on 15 mar 08 and stayed for 3 nights.The address of the hotel is lancaster gate, so get off at this tube station and not paddington it will save you a lot of time!The hotel was very clean, staff friendly, continental breakfast was nice and plentiful! Located in an upmarket area facing hyde park!Cannot fault this hotel."
