1,1270,"Oct 19 2009 	Perfect in every way!	Beautiful old hotel. The best of everything from service to food to room...you name it, every possible luxury was provided...happily. Probably the nicest hotel experience I have ever had! I arrived after 3 weeks of traveling with a group and I was down to my last nerve. I did not have a reservation but the gentleman at the desk quickly picked up that I needed some pampering and gave me a BEAUTIFUL suite and some much needed TLC."
2,1270,"Mar 3 2009 	Wanted to see what it was all about	We liked the Savoy, it was beautiful and the room was large and nicely decorated (traditionally speaking). We stayed for 1 night as we wanted to check out a higher-end historic hotel for our last night before flying back to Ottawa. With FX rates what they are, and the fact that London hotels are expensive anyway we ended up paying close to $500 CAD for the night. I think I was expecting more for the price - maybe a bit more of a &quot;wow&quot; factor, but overall we thought the hotel was fine. Great location for sure, close to the Tube. I think next time we visit London we'll look for something less expensive and more modern, but that has more to do with taste and lifestyle than the fact that we found something wrong with this hotel."
3,1270,"Nov 21 2008 	The icon of historic London hotels	[Of note, this review is of (somewhat) historical significance due to the renovations due to be completed in 2009.] Length of stay: 11 nightsCheck-in: Taxi from the train station to the hotel. Flawless check in. The porter (Tony) was the consummate professional, offering to pay the taxi for me when the cab had misplaced my fare. Accomodations: Basic single room befitting a single traveller who came to London to see the sights. The room was clean and functional. VERY nice bathroom with walk-in shower. I agree with earlier reviewers that the hotel in general was beginning to show its wear, especially noticed in the halls.Dining: I sampled everything from the Savoy Grill to In-Room Dining to the Thames Foyer (for both breakfast and tea) and the American Bar. Impressive all the way around. The tea in particular was excellent and blew away the Ritz; Savoy Grill is a solid one-star Michelin.Location: London is big enough that I don't know if there is a hotel in a perfect location, but I was within walking distance of many of the theaters (Vaudeville, Savoy, Adelphi) and the Opera. Charing Cross is the nearest Underground station.Service: Impressive all the way through with some missteps. Turn down service was missed on two of the 11 nights and room service entered a couple of times without notice. The concierge services were notable (reservations at The Square on a moments notice). Tony the porter/bellboy was again very gracious, the master of casual conversation when necessary and professionalism when required.Cost: Appropriate for the overall experience.Summary: I look forward to visiting again in the years to come. The hotel was definitely due for refurbishment and I hope many of the staff return."
4,1270,"Oct 29 2008 	Old London luxury	I stayed here with my partner and his family for one night while we went to see a show. We were on a reduced rate due to family working there so I cannot comment on value for money but I loved this place. The rooms were so cosy and warm feeling, the bed was amazing and the whole atmosphere was just warm and welcoming. Not sleek and stylish but like being wrapped in a cosy vintage blanket. The bathroom was a problem, as pointed out by a sign in there, that the bath is very high and it's very easy to slipon the floor getting in and/or out. I read the sign and thought 'oh right maybe for oldies' and then went on to slip myself and I was and agile early 20s so be careful! However, I still give 5/5 as the service, location, atmosphere of the property was so enjoyable. Perhaps the location isn't right for everyone but it all depends on where you want to be!"
5,1270,"Aug 1 2008	A bad location and the restaurants overpriced	The Savoy is one of those old grand hotels like the Plaza or Pierre in New York. But.....Our room was very old and again on the small side. While we had a lovely view of the Themes River, it is in the West End which is an awful location unless you are going to the theatre every night, which we only did once. The Grill on the top floor is very good as well as Banquette for something more casual. The only London hotel I've stayed in with an indoor pool which was very handy. The afternoon tea in the lobby lounge was decent and the bar was nice."
6,1270,"Jun 4 2008 	What a fantastic room	I stayed here for 2 weeks on a business trip and this hotel was fantastic! I was looked after so well. My room was huge (it was a corner room) and it had a large, updated, white bathroom with 2 sinks. I came home each evening to a fresh bowl of whole fruit that was always something in season. The staff were courteous and helpful. I can't say enough about this hotel. The location was okay. I do recall taking taxis everywhere and would take the tube to/from work each day in Canary Wharf, which took about 30-40 minutes. I felt very spoiled during my stay here"
7,1270,Feb 11 2008 	Fantastic	I stayed at the savoy last February with my husband and three year old daughter.On arrival we were greeted by warm welcoming staff who ensured our car was seen to immediatly they even handed our daughter a lovely teddy bear! When we got up to our room we found we had been upgraded to a suite and there were champagne and chocolates waiting for us (my husband had informed the desk that it was my birthday) this was all free of charge.The hotel is lovely rooms are clean with enormous beds and spacious bathrooms.To top it all off the view of the Thames was fantastic.Although pricey the Savoy is worth every penny and i cannot wait to return.
8,1270,"Jan 1 2008 	Nice Experience in an old hotel	Stayed at the Savoy for two nights in September. The hotel has a nice location, close to public transport. The hotel has an old school glamour to it, but you can also see that some things are worn and outdated. We prefer more modern hotels. The room was a good size and clean. We did the afternoon tea, and that was a nice experience. Overall a good stay."
9,1270,"Dec 13 2007 	Great Service	The Savoy is pricey - but well worth it - especially if you can get it on a &quot;special&quot; of one sort or another. Centrally located in downtown London, it is a great location for those who don't want to, or can't, spend their time (and money) going into and out of London. I was there with my 82 year old disabled father who was visiting London for the first time since the battle of Britian in 1943-44. He was treated like royalty by the staff and especially by the engineers !! When dad's scooter needed a replacement screw at 8pm - the engineering department, which is open 24 hours a day) had it fixed in a half an hour !! When we checked in at 8am, we were given a courtesy &quot;early check in&quot; and they even gave us an upgraded room, which was large enough for his scooter. In fact we could have put three or four scooters in that room !! The service and amenities are the Fairmont 5 star treatment that I have grown to love and appreciate. Evening turn down service, shoes shined at night, newspaper at the door in the morning, and a high speed internet connection make staying at any Fairmont a treat - and the Savoy was an especially delightful treat. Although the hotel is not entirely handicap accessible, the staff went out of their way to try to help dad get around. I understand that the Savoy is closing in 12/2007 for renovations, and that handicap accessibility is something they are going to try to remedy when it reopens.The hotel has one 110volt outlet per room, and they will loan you a voltage converter if you need more outlets. I brought a 6 plug &quot;strip&quot; and by using that we had plenty of outlets to charge the scooter, my camera, and the other devices we carried.While we were there I had a cocktail (or two) in the &quot;American Bar&quot; and saw dozens of photos of movie stars on the walls. It seems that this is THE place in London for the rich and famous to stay. It is rumored that Frank Sinatra would not stay anywhere but the Savoy when he visited London, and the same for Elizabeth Taylor. In fact, when dining at the upscale Savoy Grill, the wait staff may tell you which table was Sinatra's favorite, or which was the favorite for Winston Churchill. I met some folks at the American Bar that were Rolling Stones groupies. They invited me to a party the following evening at Simpsons on the Strand (one of three or four restaurants in the Savoy). I declined as the party didn't start until after the Stones concert was over with at 1am. The following morning at 5am the entire Rolling Stones came through the lobby and it was then that I discovered that I had declined an invitation to party with the Rolling Stones !! Next time I will be more prepared to rub elbows with the rich and famous."
10,1270,"Dec 9 2007 	Stately reputation no longer deserved.	This hotel needs $50m spent on it to re-qualify as 5-star. The rooms &amp; amenities are incredibly old &amp; tired. I stayed at The Savoy in the middle of a London heatwave &amp; the air-conditioning in my room didn't work. The toilet didn't flush at all initially &amp; even after repeated attempts to repair it, it didn't flush consistently. The battery in the safe went flat so I couldn't retrieve my passport when it came time to check-out. Far from being attentive, I found the service pretentious &amp; insincere. I felt annoyed &amp; imposed upon when a different member of staff knocked on my door every 90 minutes to ask if &quot;everything was ok with the room&quot;. Especially as they were not the least bit responsive or helpful when everything was not &quot;ok&quot;. Between the constant knocking &amp; repeated attempts to repair the air-conditioning, the toilet &amp; the safe, I felt like a member of staff was in my room 80% of the time that I was. The Savoy trades on its stately reputation, but it is no longer deserved."
11,1270,"Nov 17 2007 	Old Fashioned Elegance	Stayed for 3 nights and loved it. Our Junior River View Suite was really just a large-ish room, but we had a balcony overlooking the Thames and a postcard view of Saint Paul's. Bed and bathroom are super-comfortable. The place is definitely ready for its refurb, but still beautiful and graceful. Staff was efficient and friendly. The American Bar is probably my favorite hotel bar in the world, with its chatty and elegant host. Tea in the front restaurant is a wonderful experience.Location is extremely convenient for sightseeing and metro stops.There really is something special about the Savoy...you get a sense of tradition and understated elegance that is missing at other hotels. It has a bit less of a 'wow' factor than the Dorchester but I like it better for its clubby and traditional feel. I hope this feeling survives the refurb in December."
12,1270,"Nov 12 2007 	Ladies 	I like this Hotel. Its quintessentially English. It does white gloved afternoon tea. It has a hotel brolly and stand in the bedroom waiting for you and if you're a guy you wont be able to leave the men's room unless first brushed down by the attendant who'll find some fluff on your jacket somewhere that's for sure. Ghastly stuff that fluff!The Hotel is located right bang in the middle of London. It's five minutes from the Thames, a tube station, Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. It is also close to more theatres than you could possibly hope to do in a long weekend including of course The Savoy Theatre which is right next door to the hotel. Guys you have all the gentlemen's menswear shops you could possibly wish for not even a cricket ball's toss from the front of the hotel. We had a room with a side view of the Thames but I'm guessing that the Suites at the back would all have a gorgeous view of the river, the London Eye and of course, Big Ben.The hotel is populated by Ladies and Gentlemen all of whom have a taste for the finer things in life. Yes there are people there too that have probably saved hard to enjoy this fine hotel once in their life. But these are people who know how to behave and how to enjoy great food and drink and abuse neither.The service is first class without being too deferential or sycophantic. They've got the balance just right. Ladies &amp; gentlemen looking after ladies and gentlemen right through. Enjoy!"
13,1270,"Nov 7 2007 	Not worth your money	Before we arrived at the Savoy we were very excited because we had heard some good reviews about the hotel and we usually prefer to stay at a Fairmont hotel when we travel. However, staying at The Savoy has changed our minds forever. We came across numerous issues and were very disappointed in the way we were treated by their personnel. We found the hotel to be very old - elevator was always stopping at the wrong floor, we had problems with our toilet - it would not flush. We called for servicing several times and they could not fix the issue. We asked if we could change our rooms, but the maintenance person said it was too late in the evening to do so and there were no rooms available. The staff was not very knowledgeable and was unable to assist us with our travel plans when we asked for directions. They kept transferring the call to someone else and it took awhile before they could find someone who knew the answer. We also found the staff to be misleading - they advise the client wrong/misleading info and try to blame the client for their mistake. We think the hotel is overrated and needs alot of work on the decor, but more importantly find personnel who are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and honest. We will definitely not stay nor recommend this hotel to any of our family and/or friends. Maybe the Hilton would've been a better choice...."
14,1270,"Nov 7 2007 	Absolutely Amazing	Almost impossible to describe with words. But I have to simplify I would say this is one of the best hotel you could stay, so much history, great location and service, perfect!Great restaurants within the hotel, and the best Sunday brunch I ever had in my life, from seafood to carving station, chocolate fountain, and the best part, unlimited Laurent Perrier Champagne.The hotel is closing for renovations soon, but it is definitely something to experience before the renovations are done, if you are going to London before mid-December you should definitely consider The Savoy as your hotel of choice. It might cost more than you like to pay, but I can assure is worth."
15,1270,"Oct 29 2007 	First Class	The Savoy is a first class experience from start to finish. It is due to close at the end of this year and reopen in 2009. I hope that it loses none of it's charm and character once the renovations have been completed.When we checked in, the friendly but professional receptionist advised me that our room was not ready. However, she advised that this would not be a problem and that she was upgrading us to a suite!The suite was the best hotel room I have stayed in within the United Kindom. Spacious and clean, it also featured a massive en-suite marble bathroom with a large bath and fabulous separate walk-in shower.The service was impeccable at all times throughout the hotel and the food was delicious.This was our third stay at The Savoy in as many years and we will definitely return when it reopens, providing that it does not lose its endearing character and charm."
16,1270,"Sep 20 2007 	Get there before the refurb	Having been to The Savoy a number of times for business meetings it was always a hotel I have wanted to stay at not only for the history but also for its location. However the cost has always been a little hard to bear. You can imagine my pleasure when idly scanning through hotels.com and seeing the hotels latest offer of 99 pppn including continental breakfast.I booked and treated my wife for a 2 night surprise visit. Apparently the cheaper rates are due to the fact that the hotel is closing at Christmas for one year to undergo a refurbishment. Does it need a refurbishment? Probably is the answer but it isnt tatty. More like faded but still impressive.From the moment we walked through the doors we were made very welcome indeed. The doormen were attentive and eager to help. The reception staff were efficient and courteous (showed us to our room, happens infrequently these days). This was the standard for the whole stay. The room was great if you like Art Deco. We do, and we loved it. From the curved doors to the best bathroom I think I have ever had in a hotel everything was just as I expected. Bathrobes, slippers quality shampoos and the like were also in the room. There was even a small stationary set in the desk.The continental breakfast was very good indeed. Smoothies and mini muffins to start with. Orange juice on tap. An almost limitless choice of teas and a basket of breads and pastries. More than sufficient and as always the service was of the highest calibre.We didnt eat at the hotel but a menu for the Savoy grill indicated a three course meal for 60. There are apparently another 6 restaurants in the hotel as well. We did have a drink in the American bar late on Saturday night and it was a nice experience. Pianist, nice atmosphere and, again, great service. Expensive? On face value yes. 30 for two cocktails. But I personally think its worth it.Finally the location. Two minute walk to Covent Garden and five minutes to Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross Tube. I dont think there is a better spot for tourists. If you baulk at hotel mini bar prices, we do at any hotel not just The Savoy, there is a Tesco express on the corner of The Strand and Lancaster Place/Waterloo Bridge 2 minutes away.You should stay at this hotel at least once in your life. You should probably stay before they refurbish it, its like going to the old Wembley, just one of those places you should see. You never know, Americans own it now, they may make a hash of the refurb and ruin it forever. No disrespect to any Americans intended.Service like this doesnt seem to exist in hotels anymore and Ive stayed in plenty all around the world for business and pleasure. I for one am prepared to pay a premium for it but its nice to get a bargain once in a while."
17,1270,"Sep 3 2007 	The Savoy in London's West End Theatre District	The Savoy isn't the reputed, 7 star Burj Al Arab in Dubai, Arab Emirates which costs 60 Euros just to step inside for a glimpse of its dazzling lobby. No, The Savoy, located on The Strand (in London's West End theatre district) has far more history and class behind it to set such pretentious and insolent limits. Frankly, a curious tourist could walk inside and enjoy the elegant, calming atmosphere of The Savoy without much ado. With limited budget, they could make their way to the &quot;Banquette&quot; and enjoy chef/patron Marcus Wareing's delightful concoctions. And, if you return the staff's politeness, you just might get the best seat in this informal setting--in the corner, in the far end, closest to the kitchen, overlooking the drive where one can watch the guests stepping out of their elegant cars and into the Art Deco style lobby of one of the most historic hotels in London. Opened in 1889 with 263 rooms and suites, The Savoy has seen history played out in its resplendent halls. Starting with the management of Cesar Ritz from Paris, chef Auguste Escoffier, and master of wine Louis Echenard (maitre d'hotel), the hotel became known for an unparalleled attention to detail and innovation. It was not uncommon to see guests such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lily Lantry, or even Edward VII seeking out the hotel's impeccable service. Sir Winston Churchill, Eleanor Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, and many many others have ventured through the doors of The Savoy. In 1953, Queen Elizabeth II was crowned. The Savoy threw &quot;the ball of the century&quot; on the evening of Coronation day.In short, few hotels could possibly try to replicate the feeling and ambience that are invoked at this fascinating place. And, for a weery travel such as myself, it was a relaxing haven where I found myself writing short stories and--in general--feeling creative. So many memories seemed to be floating around the halls and the rooms that it was difficult to capture all of the words and the emotions that sprange from brain to fingers. To add to the quality of the visit, the polite staff were everywhere greeting their guests, attempting to be helpful and welcoming. The rooms were not extensive but warm, inviting, relaxing, calming, clean, and carried the theme of Art Deco throughout. And, the garden, just steps away, was simply an extension of the hotel itself. Another of many ways to relax and enjoy the brief moments one has to be peaceful.Note: sorry but, due to renovations, the hotel plans to be closed from Dec/2007 thru 2009."
18,1270,"Aug 28 2007 	Fabulous hotel	We had a wonderful stay at the Savoy for our first visit to London. The location is so convenient, I would hesitate to stay anywhere else.Check-in was quick and pleasant. As we arrived about 9 am, our room was not ready, but they took my cell phone number to contact us while we saw something of the city. They took care of our luggage and we were off. We received a call about noon from the front desk that our room was ready.The gentleman who showed us to our room was very nice, asking about out plans and even made some suggestions.Our room was very nice, with a view of Waterloo Bridge. Soft sheets, plenty of soft pillows..but the real highlight is the bathroom! At the end of our first day, we were tired and achey. Well, the tub is big enough for two and filled so quickly, there is even a sign not to leave the room to avoid floods. With the provided bath salts, that tub really hit the spot. Of course, I later fell in love with the rainshower fixture. I have to figure out how to get one at my house.Continental breakfast was included and it was always delightful to enjoy it in the Riverview Restaurant. Once we saw how much it would have cost if it hadn't been included, we made sure not to miss it! The room is lovely and the service is great. If we wanted to upgrade to the full buffet, it would have been 5 pounds more per person, but we never thought that was necessary. We did need it delivered to out room one morning when we were taking the Eurostar to Paris for the day and needed to eat before the dining room was open. There was a 6 pound charge to deliver it to the room, but it was worth it.Another treat was the American Bar. We met a wonderful server Claire and a great bartender James. They helped us have a blast one night!The doormen were always great, the room was always spotless and the concierge always answered every question. One even made a great suggestion where we could find a good curry! It was very good, by the way. Oh, and we had a treat our first evening when they left a little cake in honor of my birthday, which we were celebrating on this trip! It was delicous. What else can I say? An historic hotel, especially if you appreciate Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, with fantastic service! I would stay here again."
19,1270,"Aug 20 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location!	We just returned from our stay at the Savoy. We absolutely loved the hotel and had a wonderful time. Our rooms were recently remodeled and on the second floor right up the stairs and around the corner from the lobby. I think the room numbers were 201 and 202. Since we had our two teens with us, we had two connecting rooms. They connected through a hallway, not through the actual rooms. This meant we used one door to acess both rooms. It was not a family room. We actually liked these rooms better because they each had a bathroom. They did not really have views, but the rooms were big and the bathrooms were amazing! The rainshower was the highlight of the bathroom. It was so hard going from these rooms to the ones at the Westin in Paris. They just could not compare. The buffet breakfast every morning (included in our rate) was great! We loved the tea and hot chocolate. The staff remembered our names and greeted us each day. Everyone was nice and helpful. One complaint I would have is that when we checked in they asked me what newspaper I wanted delivered to our room. They did not tell me it would be an extra charge. When I checked out I found out they charged me three pounds a day for the paper. Other than that we loved our stay at the Savoy. I would absolutely stay there again. Just to let you know, they did tell me that the hotel will be closing in late December for a complete remodel and will open again about a year later."
20,1270,"Aug 17 2007 	A superb experience!	We stayed at the Savoy for two nights in August 2007. It was a 'hotel/show' package, but was still quite expensive compared with our usual practices! We were a bit 'apprehensive' about whether it would be 'posh', and whether we'd be the 'poor relations', having done a package. We couldn't have been more wrong! from the friendly. warm greeting from the commissionaire, to the reception staff, porters, maids, restaurant staff and everyone we met. They were professional, but relaxed, friendly, helpful, welcoming. It was a great experience!. Our package included continental breakfast, but for 5.00, (5.00!) we upgraded to the full and mignificent buffet! The room (de luxe) was large, with a huge bathroom. In no time we were really used to being in the Savoy! If you're simply thinking about it, just do it!!!"
21,1270,Aug 13 2007	Dissapointed	Took my wife for her 30 birthday as a special treat but i found the savoy to be anything but special. Having stayed at other various 5 star hotels in london we had high expectations of the savoy. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The carpets looked like they had been layed around 30 years ago by blind men. The toilet didn't want to flush. The bed was small and as soft as a marshmellow and dipped in the centre. We both had back pain in the morning. The bath and a chip in the middle. The room needs fully refurbishing. We had dinner in the Thames Foyer at around 9. The restaurant was very quite but while the staff were friendly they was very slow. We didn't recieve the attention we thought we would considering the place was empty and costly. Overall the staff were helpful but i left this hotel wishing i had gone somewhere else.
22,1270,"Aug 9 2007 	Great Hotel Great Staff Great Location	I took my entire family to the Savoy for 9 nights in July and August and we were completely satisfied. We booked interconnecting rooms. One room for the children and one for my wife and me. The interconnecting family rooms dont have the views that the other rooms do, but they were large and very comfortable. There was no charge for a roll away bed for my 2 year old either.The location is great and we could move easily about London by going to the close by (5 minute walk through the Thames entrance) Embankment stop or the bus stop across the street. We could walk to the Waterloo Underground stop as well. We also walked to Buckingham Palace (35 minute walk through St. James park past Trafalgar Square) and the London Eye (15 minutes), Big Ben (15 minutes), Westminster Abbey (20 minutes). So, its location was very convenient.The staff was terrific. The housekeeping was a little different than we were used to, but I think it is an English housekeeping issue and not the staff, i.e. not removing glasses of water where there is a minute amount of water remaining in the glass.Our kids spent some time in the pool which is small and indoors, but they had fun and it was a nice respite from walking through the city.We read the prior reviews regarding the exorbitant costs for the restaurants in the hotel and avoided them all together. This proved fairly easy since there is a nice caf in the park on the Thames side of the hotel which we ate breakfast in a few times. Additionally, the hotel is very close to other cafes (Caf Nero, Starbucks), chain restaurants (Wagemama), and traditional English restaurants (Porters). So, one can easily go without eating in the hotel and save a few hundred pounds.Our only issue, which is minor and we hope will be resolved with the reconstruction to begin in December of 2007, is the labyrinth of hallways and stairs to get the elevators from the Thames entrance. With children and a stroller, it proved to be very tiresome. However, this inconvenience was vastly outweighed by the terrific service and amenities of the Savoy."
23,1270,"Jul 9 2007 	Excellent Location	What makes a 5 Star, a 5 Star?I personally would not rate the hotel as a 5 star, 4 star plus possibly.Don't get me wrong there is nothing at all wrong with the Savoy, it is a very good hotel in probably the best location in London. The rooms are of a large size, the beds are comfortably the bathrooms are great.For the cost of staying here, I was maybe expecting something a bit more. I suspect alot of the guests at the Savoy don't even think the rates are expensive. Especially when in the lobby I overhead an American trying to get theatre tickets for Mamma Mia that night. He was charged by the hotel about 80.00 per head, if he had walked to the theatre approx 10 mins away, would probably not have paid more than 50.00 per head. To the hotel's credit they did advise him of this.All in all a good hotel, where the location is second to none. To be honest the premier travel inn at county hall is one of the best least expensive hotels that I have stayed in London."
24,1270,Jul 2 2007	Valentine weekend	A trruly 5 star hotel with impecable serivce and unfortunately prices to match. Afternoon absolutely fantastic but 35 a head as was breakfast at 25 per head
25,1270,"Jun 25 2007 	Love the hotel hate the mean spirited extra charges!	A special occasion demands a special hotel, and our stay at The Savoy delivered most of what I had hoped for when I booked the 1 night stay for me and my wife. The positives? A top welcome from Tony, the friendly and efficient doorman who took care of the valet parking arrangements for me and insisted on helping me in with my bags. The room itself was one of the art deco originals and although in need of modernisation it had all the atmosphere and charm that I had hoped for. Superb bed, with great linen and acres of room to stretch out. Massive bath, of Olympian proportions in a traditional and spotless marble bathroom. And binding the whole thing together was a sense of history and all round specialness that The Savoy has exuded for over a century.And the negatives? Unexceptional check-in and no offer of assistance with luggage  made me feel almost invisible as I staggered away with my bags towards the single lift serving guest floors. The extra charges for almost anything consumed, including the bottle of water left on the dressing table, with a Lewis Carroll style label around the neck, inviting the guest to Drink me! then to discover that a whopping 5.00 would be added to the bill. The minibar was astronomically overpriced  we debated the relative merits of opting for the 4.00 Pringles or the 6.50 nuts (we picked the nuts in the end, in a flourish of indulgence). And then there was the 1.50 phone charge for calling the Banquette restaurant, which is part of the hotel  deducted from bill with apology from check out clerk, but it just shouldnt have been there in the first place. The VAT on top of the published rate is just a racket as far as Im concerned, but so many of the better hotels seem to quote this way. And as a finale, there was the discretionary 5% service charge added to the bill, which I felt obliged to pay, even though the door staff and restaurant staff had been taken care of previously with adequate tips. Of course, I have the money and the amounts are relatively small - it's just a point of principle that when the little touches are all charged so ruthlessly, the sense of welcome becomes diluted by the strictness of the accounting process.A very grand hotel that gave us what we wanted, but the art of hospitality was a little thinner on the ground that I am used to in other parts of the world. Perhaps its just a London thing?"
26,1270,"Jun 24 2007 	WOW The Savoy!	I still find it hard to believe we stayed at The Savoy!What a lovely, grand hotel, a true delight in every way.We found the service to be superb, they go out of their way to make you feel very welcome, and are not stuffy! Classically art deco throughout. Our room was spacious, with a FANTASTIC view of the Thames! Bathroom was beautiful with the memorable rainfall shower! Had room service evening meal in our room one night and the service was outstanding. Only negative was a few things looked a little tired, but that almost goes along with the whole art deco theme, so it excuses it...at least in my mind.Very expensive, but worth it just for the memories! Enjoy!"
27,1270,"May 16 2007 	Great New Years Eve	We stayed here one night for new years eve.Great great great... cannot say that enough.Expensive but really worth it.We arrived at 2pm to check in but the room was not ready so they treated us to a full English afternoon tea on the house or drinks in the american bar. At 70 for 2, the tea was great and better still free!..The service at this hotel is the best I have ever had."
28,1270,"May 10 2007 	Brilliant! Loved it!	Wonderful...from the moment we arrived to the sad time 3 days later when we had to leave, this place is awesome. Kind, courteous staff, rooms beautifully done in grand elegance, crystal, glass, heavy drapery, and perfectly appointed lav. Robes, slippers, bath salts, everything we wanted and more! Quiet room, bed so comfy i could sleep forever, American Bar fun, lobby delightful (watched a couple become engaged!) everything perfect. Wish the dollar was better!"
29,1270,"Apr 21 2007	Still An Excellent Hotel	Using the Fairmont web-site I booked online only two hours prior to checking in.As you'd expect, of The Savoy and of a Fairmont hotel, it is excellent. In particular the service is, as one would hope, attentive and careful. The room was large, well equipped and comfortable, and the bathroom was almost as big as the main room.All in all, a very good hotel, excellently situated on the Strand near to Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden, with all the airs of excellence that one would hope for."
30,1270,Apr 20 2007 	Sheer class!	Booked a 3 night stay at the Savoy for our 10th wedding anniversary. We decided to splash out a little and book a junior Suite. There is agreat feeling when you arrive a such a top class hotel. We checked in to find that they had upgraded us to one of the master suites. We were personally escorted to our huge suite by very friendly staff. The view overlooking the Thames was fantastic.This set the tone for a wonderful 3 night break. The hotel staff were extremely friendly throughout. The Savoy is an expensive hotel. You have to expect things like food and drink to be expensive as well as your room. One thing you might not expect is that VAT is added on top of your room rate. So expect to pay at least 17.5% more than the rate quoted. On our final night we dined at the savoy Grill.The food was absolutely fantastic. The set 'sampler menu' is a 7 course delight!It costs 70 per head but is well worth it. But beware the drinks arepricey. Not many wines under 60 a bottle. With Service charge you won't get much change out of 250.If you stay at the Savoy you must expect top prices. In return you get the best Service I have ever experienced. But for a special occassion it's well worth pushing the boat out. Thanks Savoy for a great time we will never forget!
31,1270,"Apr 18 2007 	Excellent experience	We love this hotel, my partner &amp; I alway stay here atleast twice a year sometimes with our daugther. The staff are as you'd expect from a 5* hotel as is the service. The rooms are immaculate, gorgeous bathrooms with rain forest shower heads. The Grill restaurant is superb-Gordon Ramsey has excellent menu choices. Great location for Covent Garden &amp; Simpsons on the Strand restaurant is just next door."
32,1270,"Mar 28 2007 	Beats sleeping on the embankment	On my last day at school as we were saying our goodbyes my headmaster offered his hand and told me that &quot;You leave this school unscathed by education...I have no doubt you will eventually end up sleeping on the embankment.&quot; Well, he was sort of right when we checked into the fabled Savoy. This was a birthday treat for my wife and although we have eaten there before, staying would be a new experience. I was pleasantly surprised. We had booked a Deluxe King room and on arrival we were upgraded to a 6th. floor junior suite with a fabulous view over the River. The room was huge with beautiful plasterwork, a very comfortable bed and some nice pieces of furniture. The marble bathroom was smallish for the size of the room but had the most amazing deluge shower I have ever stood under. The staff were very helpful and greeted you whenever you passed them. Breakfast was the only let down. At these prices you don't expect thin sliced soggy toast. Overall a nice experience...I am sure you can do better for the money but there's only one Savoy."
33,1270,"Mar 15 2007 	Wonderful but watch the cost!	We stayed here for one night only but it was lovely. The room was expensive but the rate did not include VAT which was an unpleasant surprise. We had the buffet for breakfast which was ridiculously expensive (not realising, I only had a bowl of cereal which cost me the full &quot;all you can eat&quot; rate of 27!!!! The frosties were not even gold plated!!!) Service charges for room service were also on the excessive side and the mini bar was a shocker.That said, however, we did not expect it to be cheap, and our stay was wonderfully memorable. I would not do it too often, but overall the experience was worth it! The room was lovely (awful view but suppose they cannot help what they are surrounded by), and the bed was perhaps the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The shower was amazing and though my other half had had a bath only hours before, had to try it out as soon as we arrived.The staff were beyond reproach and nothing was too much trouble even when I parked my car randomly and blocked off the front of the hotel!"
34,1270,"Mar 13 2007 	Sad to say but this place could use a few changes	We travel alot and Love staying at fancy hotels and eating at gourmet restaurants and being pampered while on vacation. Unfortunately, we didn't feel entirely pampered at the Savoy. I read all the mixed reviews on this site before making my reservation because I hoped that the 5 star place where Claude Monet painted would be a wonderful experience. I am sad to report that the bad reviews were right. The front desk staff is young, and sometimes maybe immature, and the professionism was uneven to say the best. We arrived not feeling welcomed at all. Our first room (yes, we had to move) had a b'dai that didn't work and almost caused a flood while we were there. They did not handle it well. After someone came to the room to inspect, we were not offered another room, but we were told that a plumber would come the next day? After worrying about how we were going to plan our day around a plumber, we finally called and asked if we could be moved and they coplied which relieved us but we still had to pack up and plan around the move the next day. The second room was bigger, but really just acceptable by american standards. There were stains (food?) on the carpet, not too big but really something that looked liked it could have been cleaned better. The First room with the bad b'dai was too small, and there could have been a meter more length at least. One walked carefully betwen the bed and bureau but it had high ceilings and beautiful old details. The Marble bathrooms were pretty beautiful too, and the place is right on the RIver pracitically--which makes it a beautiful property. The Buffet Restaurant Staff were definitely well trained, and were very accommodating. The food Quality was excellent. The Banquette Restaurant staff were also great and the menu read well. We almost had dinner at the Savoy Grill which looked great too. The concierge staff were also helpful and very nice. Our highlight was HOT Stuff a restaurant recommended in the nytimes, where the proprietor TAJ was so Kind. I guess my feeling of Savoy is mixed too, my feeling is that I basically was not made to feel totally at home there, half the time, I was greeted warmly in the halls by the staff the other times made to feel awkward --but I can say that I won't be returning to the Savoy anytime soon. I did fully enjoy my time there but I wish it would have been more like I imagined it before now,"
35,1270,"Feb 4 2007 	Old and Overrated	I have stayed in a number of Fairmont properties and truly expected this to be the best of the best, based on the price and reputation of &quot;The Savoy&quot;. What a huge and I mean HUGE dissappointment. I will never stay there again and on the 2nd day considered rebooking at another hotel. We planned our trip for one week at the hotel and upon arriving we asked for a room upgrade. We were told we could upgrade for an additional $160 per night. So we passed! We were not granted early check-in even though I'm a President's Club member of Fairmont, so we had to go from an 8 hour flight to the hotel and then wait 6 hours for a room. The 2nd person that checked us in offered us a free room upgrade when we informed her of our anniversary! So, we went to the room and it was a 2 bedroom suite. It was fine, but nothing great at all, just seemed old. The bathroom had a tub/shower...and a rubber bathmat that slipped ever time you try to get in the tub. I fell 3 times getting into the tub. The bathroom is very, very old, not luxurious at all. The price for the room that we stayed in was approximately 450 pounds and if I had to pay that amount I would have been embarassed and mad because the room and hotel were just not resort-like or anywhere near a luxury hotel. I'm still kicking myself for not checking out of the hotel and moving elsewhere. The restaurants there were ok, very empty and very pretentious waitstaff. One drink in the bar will cost you $25. Also, the &quot;service charge&quot;, VAT and such add approximately $100 onto the cost of the already over priced room. Be warned: Stay elsewhere"
36,1270,"Jan 27 2007 	Amazing just wonderful!	Arriving at the Savoy my boyfriend and I were greeted by polite and very friendly staff. The building is amazing with alot of history.A nice little bar with piano playing in the back ground, a touch of class... The room was very nice and spacious and the shower was just delux! Found out there is a swiming pool on the roof top so do take advantage if you decide to stay. We staying in a king delux and champagne awaited us. To end a perfect evening my boyfreind did the down on one knee thing. Bless!!!! I said yes of course ( but made him wait till morning for an answer!)"
37,1270,"Jan 22 2007	Lovely family weekend at the famous Savoy	Spent Saturday night there, mid January with my wife and the twins (5 year old boys). My wife had booked the hotel plus dinner at the Savoy Grill as a 50th birthday present. In terms of staff, I cannot fault the experience; from doorman through to the Maitre d' at the restaurant, and everyone in between, were all just wonderful to us and the boys: not pretentious or stuffy or haughty (a slight fear for us) just kind, engaging and helpful. They very much helped make the weekend a delight.We booked a 'special' family experience for 349 for two interconnecting rooms and breakfast. The rooms were lovely traditional style rooms, high ceilings, plenty big enough, elegant furniture and prints, marble bathroom, (mid-size but adequate). We had been told there wasn't a river view family room available but that we would get one overlooking the courtyard: we didn't get that either, but faced a rather unpleasant looking block of rooms opposite, but this was the only negative aspect of the trip (bar the price - see below). In all other respects the rooms were better than expected.We went swimming in a small but lovely swimming pool on the third floor, and ate dinner early at 5.45 with the boys in the famous Grill. The food was simply brilliant, and whilst the whole affair was little taxing on the two boys after about an hour, they managed well: they were treated to a tour of the kitchens, were given special treats by the waiters and were generally treated with respect - another fear we had had in advance was that they would be unwelcome in this rather sedate envrionment. If they were, we weren't to know it. The kids menu was not quite appropriate for the unrefined tastes of my two, but the kitchen were happy to supply pretty well anything we asked for - pasta with melted cheese for mains, a portion of carrots to start etc.Kids eat free there but before you all rush, the adults pay through the nose! To be fair, it was a special event for us so we didn't hold back on the glasses of champagne to start etc. The basic cost is 30 for the pre-theatre menu or 60 for the full menu, both 3 courses each (plus a couple of delightful extras thrown in). If we'd have been more careful we might have walked out with change from 200 but in the end...we didn't. And thus to the overall costs - from a tempting family experience offer of 349 spiralled to over 700 by the time we included the dinner, the valeting, the ridiculous mini-bar charges etc. all of which could be easily avoided if you wish to. That said, and given slight reservations beforehand, (I was expecting faded glory but we got art deco splendour) we had a delightful time; highly recommended."
38,1270,"Jan 15 2007 	Suite dreams 	I stayed here last weekend for my in-laws Ruby Wedding anniversary. It was an incredibly memorable stay not least because of the amazing service we received (and the amount of food I ate!). Our party of 6 had three suites on the 8th floor, each was different and each was lovely  ours had a separate living room (although a smaller bathroom). We all had amazing views of the river and very comfortable beds and great smellies.My in-laws were spoiled from the moment they arrived (they stayed there 3 nights) and when we got there so were we. We had lunch and tea in the Thames Foyer where the pianist serenaded us not once but twice! Then we had dinner in the Savoy Grill which was probably the greatest meal out Ive ever had. AND then on to the American bar for another pianist and drinks.We had the 7 course tasting menu in the Savoy Grill were my in-laws came 40 years ago on their honeymoon (see I wasnt kidding about eating). Im not sure if it was the special occasion or just the exceptional service but we had the head waiter serve us who was outstanding and we went on a kitchen tour just before dessert. The food was amazing.Like other reviewers I felt the only let down was the breakfast in the morning (River Restaurant). Its a buffet and my husband found his cooked food items werent exactly hot. At the time we went for breakfast 9.50am it was not well-stocked and they were trying to get everyone out by 10.30am to set up for lunch which was very disappointing.Yes the communal areas are a little faded but it is part of the charm of the place. Our rooms, the American bar nor the Savoy Grill exhibited the need to be re-decorated.Its rare I stay in hotels in London (my mother lives here so not really any need) but this was a lovely memorable stay."
39,1270,"Jan 8 2007	Robbed at the Savoy	I was staying at the Savoy on a business trip. My room was broken into and I was robbed of 3 laptops. They were too large to go into the safe. They were not out and visible, but kept in cases under a chair in the room. Apparently the thieves had used a housekeeping closet to access the roof and break into my window. Key records showed that there were a number of staff entries into my room that day, many of them after 6pm - when the crime took place. The hotel said it was turndown service, but when I entered my room at 10:30pm, my bed had not been turned down. The hotel offered me a &quot;river view&quot; room as consolation for my loss. I only wanted a room without a rooftop nearby. Not that it mattered... but there was no river view. I was disappointed in the hotel's response. All they kept saying was &quot;this never happens here.&quot; Other staff members told me it happens frequently."
40,1270,"Jan 1 2007	Very good hotel but needs renovation of bathrooms	Booking the Fine Resorts with Amex is a good move here. For about 350 pounds, I had all the amenities and a guaranteed upgrade to a river view junior suite. The suite was nice; room was large but bathroom really needs a renovation. The old tubs are a pain to get in and out of (and unsafe) and you see grime and gook in the wall and bath tiles. At that price, it should be better. Hotel public room facilities are nice; breakfast and afternoon tea very good. Service is also very good. Concierges were somewhat helpful but frankly not as on the ball as I'd hoped at that level. I've stayed here a few years ago and was hoping with all the various hype that there was more renovation on the property; it's not truly at the 5 star level for its price but the location is quite good and the views from the suites are pretty and it certainly isn't bad -- just not quite as good as it should be."
41,1270,"Dec 5 2006 	comfortable luxury	Having stayed at the Savoy several times previously it was our first choice when planning a short shopping trip for christmas recently. The booking with the hotel didn,t go toally smoothly and I had to chase up my confirmation which should have been e mailed to me, and I was also shown as having been given an upgrade when I had actually paid for the room specified on the confirmation. In addition the fact that I had paid for a B&amp;B package wasn,t specified so I telephoned the hotel in the early evening and my call was diverted to the head office in Canadawhere an extremely helpful guy ironed out all the problems. On arrival the check in was quick and smooth and we were immediatlely shown to our room by the check-in girl. This personal service isn,t very common but I think it should be.The room was a junior river view suite on the 6th floor and had a wonderful view of the river, eye and big ben. I had booked afternoon tea which was lovely if a little expensive and we had planned to eat in the informal restaurant Banquette later in the evening but changed our minds as the restaurant was virtually empty and previous experience told us that this would mean it would be devoid of any atmosphere. We ate across the road at Salierie instead.Breakfast was ok but it is the one aspect which I am never really happy about. It always seems a lot slower and less organised than you would expect from a 5 star hotel and in the past I have had to complain about the food as well as the time taken. The choice available is good but I,m always left feeling slightly annoyed about the whole experience, made worse as I really look forward to having a breakfast cooked for me when I,m away.My other gripe is the policy of closing the bar at 10.30pm on a sunday. This is absolutely ridiculous and means you can,t arrive back at the hotel after a meal,theatre or just an evening out, and enjoy a nightcap or two. Having said all of the above, our overall stay was very enjoyable - the staff are very friendly, the hotel has a certain atmosphere and the location is excellent. There are many other hotels in the area but none seem to have that certain something which the Savoy has and I would therefore recommend this hotel without hesitation."
42,1270,"Nov 14 2006 	Expensive and Disappointing!	Being familiar with Fairmont hotels and the historic reputation of the Savoy, I anticipated a wonderful stay. Unfortunately it was anything but memorable. The hotel is now living on its reputation. It is tired, worn and frayed and very expensive. I always stay in 5 stars hotels and the Savoy fails to meet the basic criteria of a 5 star hotel. Whatever wonderful traditions created its aura have long since past. I found the staff to be cold, impersonal and totally uninterested.The rooms (I had two stays back to back with a short break in between) were tiny, the furniture and walls banged up, and everything past its prime. To pay $600 a night to stay in a smelly closet is an affront. The common rooms were worn and the staff was rude and couldn't wait to get rid of us. Twice while we were in the bars we were asked when we would be leaving as there were others waiting to be seated (we had been there 30 minutes). Perhaps we're just used to a higher standard in America."
43,1270,"Nov 1 2006	Anniversary Break - Very Good	Checked into a Junior Suite for one night for anniversary stay. Had a great time. Room was beautiful art deco, lovely room overlooking the Thames. Paid 500 including breakfast and a bottle of champagne. On arrival concierge very efficient. Drinks in the American bar were fun in the early evening, very buzzy, with a great atmosphere before people head their separate ways for the evening. The breakfast in the morning (River Restaurant) was the only disappointment. Had to queue to get in, and then there was a huge queue for the buffet which was not well-stocked and very disappointing. Almost like they were on some cost-cutting exercise (I can only believe this as they have had 100 years to get breakfast right, so people turning up for breakfast can't be a surprise). I've had better breakfast service in 3 star hotels. I did complain at reception, and was comped my drinks from the bar the previous evening by way of consolation. Used the delightful little spa later in the morning (which we had all to ourselves) before checking out. Would definitely go back. It's steeped in history, great service overall and a real antidote to modern uniform hotels. I would however, book room only, and take breakfast elsewhere."
44,1270,"Oct 25 2006 	Fairmont Expectations Met Local Surprises Delight	It's definitely clear The Savoy has been brought in line with some of the standards set forth by Fairmont. It's definitely good to see there's another layer of quality management guiding the hotel. Check - in was fast and efficient, and I was led directly to my room. The key system was a little difficult to understand, I never quite had an easy time opening the door to my room. Housekeeping excelled with additional touches such as replacing half-used items with new, but not disposing of the half-used items, would also neatly fold clothes found strewn about. A service charge is added to the bill upon check out to cover maid service; it's definitely deserved and saves me the trouble of leaving cash in my room. As a Fairmont Presiden'ts Club member, I was entitled to a coveted banquette seat in Simpson's (next door), and given a free glass of champagne and some canapes while I perused the menu. Definitely a value add for even general members in the free Fairmont President's Club. I also wasn't charged for the internet usage due to my FPC membership. It's nice to see a free hotel frequent guest program begin rewarding guests with little extras right away, just for signing up. Fairmont definitely has my repeat business. The concierge staff shone particularly at this location. I reserved some theatre tickets long before my stay, but there was a problem with the time written on them, and I arrived at the show late due to the mistake. When I presented my problem to the concierge later that night, he offered to call the theatre to rectify the problem, and said he would contact me by 10 the next morning. By 9 the next morning, I had a call informing me the full price would be refunded. Excellent! I suspect I wouldn't have had such service directly from the theatre company myself without intervention. I didn't get to sample this service, but I think it's neat that the hotel room service offers takeaway cuisine for the plane flight. It comes in a Savoy cooler that you keep. The price is steep, but a good way to pamper yourself."
45,1270,"Oct 23 2006 	Excellent hotel and superb staff	We (youngish couple) were in london for two nights and decided to spoil ourselves by booking into the SAvoy. I can honestly sayt that the hotel was superb. The location is great - short distance to Covent Garden, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben etc, and also on the doorstep of all theatres.Our room was an excelletn size and from the moment we checked in the staff treat you like royalty. The rooms are decorated in an 'old world' style, with chandeliers and fireplaces.this ios definitly the place to stay for excellent service, large rooms and superb food.I will definitely go back!"
46,1270,"Sep 28 2006	Maybe it's a London thing..........	It all started well from Heathrow using their car service. I arrived on an early flight so I used the gym to freshen up after the flight and went straight to the office as my room wasn't ready. They were very helpful and the staff were the best anywhere I've been at that point.When I did get back and check-in to my room it all got very disappointing. See the list below. Some things are small and people might roll their eyes, others are not. But given I've stayed all over the world I know what 5 star is, and this isn't it. I also know what USD 600 per night should buy and this is also not it. Then again, this is the first time I've stayed in a London Hotel so maybe it's a local thing.- Given they had all day, my bags were still not in my room upon return and I had to wait 10 minutes for them - no apology by the way.- The room overall was small (definitely a London thing I've been told) and run down, peeling paint, a head board from the 60s, cracked tiles in the bathroom and just little things like pens that didn't work.- The mattress is lumpy and takes some effective positioning to avoid what felt like a rolled up towel under your back. Now this was a real surprise because I've had hard/soft beds but you don't stay at place like this and expect a lumpy bed.- The bathrobe actually had grease or some sort of dark grimy stain on it.My general feeling is The Savoy runs on past glories and lacks any real attention to detail and is in desperate need of a refurbishment. The staff are exceptional at the desk, but maybe management should take a look at their own rooms a bit. I was very glad to see it was well down the list of London hotels, it deserves to be there. I won't return and will be trying somewhere else next time."
47,1270,"Sep 26 2006 	Great location	We stayed at the Savoy for two night prior to a cruise in early September. The location is the best. It central to everything, so it is only a short taxi, bus, or tube ride to anywhere you can't walk. As we were booked through the cruise line, we had an older room with no view. The room and the bath were both huge. The room was clean, although it could have used some updating in some areas. The electric didn't work when we first got to the room and we had to call several times before we finally flagged a technician down in the hall to get him to fix it. Breakfast was included in our package and it was amazing. A wonderful buffet with a beautiful view. It was expensive, so if it's not included, I'd eat elsewhere. Would I stay at the Savoy again? No, probably not. I don't think it is worth it. I stayed at the Strand Palace across the street several years ago and the price is about 1/3 that of the Savoy and the location is the same."
48,1270,"Sep 15 2006 	Great experience	This hotel was a great value for the money. The location was very good, lots of buses run along the Strand and its an easy walk to wandering through Covent Garden. We even walked to Big Ben from the hotel! We arrived after an overnight flight at 10am and our room was ready. The concierges were very helpful with everything from transportation questions to restaurant recommendations. We did find questionable charges on our bill upon checkout (we did not drink a bottle of wine from the minibar or eat chocolates for ridiculous hotel prices!) and the front desk staff was quick to take them off. Overall, a very nice experience and the tea was the perfect break in a busy sightseeing day."
49,1270,"Sep 2 2006 	Excellent stay in London	We are always amazed at how well we are treated at Fairmont Hotels, as Presidents Club members. The Savoy was no exception and provided a glimpse of elegant English service and style. We used a suite upgrade voucher and were shown to an exceptionally large 1 bedroom suite overlooking the Thames, in a quiet location on the top floor of the hotel. An exquisite breakfast was available in the Riverside restaurant each morning (included in our rate) and we enjoyed special treatment at Simpsons. Overall, highly civilized and gracious and we would definitely make a return visit."
50,1270,"Aug 27 2006 	6 great nights at the Savoy	Following a British Isles cruise we stayed 6 nights at the Savoy (Aug 20-26th) in a deluxe room at the Summer special rate of 209pounds a night.Our room was large &amp; comfortable and cleaned twice a day (morning &amp; turndown approx 7pm) loads of fresh towels, Savoy robes and the rainfall shower was wonderful (special shower head about 18 inches in diameter) . We had 2 beds with fluffy white feather duvets, they were wonderful &amp; comfortable. The toiletries provided were very nice quality (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath/shower gel) There was a large, lit closet with a safe that was easy to use. You will even find a red &quot;Savoy&quot; umbrella to borrow.On arrival there was a tray of fresh berries &amp; an almond cookie shaped like the Fairmont &quot;F&quot;The staff at the front desk &amp; the doormen get to know your name so as I passed through the lobby they would always say 'good afternoon Ms ______. Very friendly and welcoming.One funny thing, the wake up calls are done by real people - not a taped message, so the first day I had a wake up call and when the phone rang at 8:00am I just picked it up and set it down without listening, then it rang again and I did the same thing, then it rang again and finally I said hello. The fellow said &quot;Madame you hung up on me twice, this is your wake up call&quot; I apologized saying I assumed it was a recording and he said 'Madame this is the Savoy, we do not have recordings&quot; :-)Room Service was a fortune (ie) 20pounds for continental breakfast, 15 pounds for a sandwich. One night we were tired from touring and stayed in and ordered dinner - I had the most delicious Lobster Salad (24 pounds) and Chicken Curry (18 pounds) in fact it was the best meal I had in my entire UK trip (16 days). I also had a double bailies on the rocks (18 pounds)High speed internet is 18 pounds for 24hours and works great, you can also pay 30 pounds and get unlimited movies in your room for the same 24 hours. (to buy a movie on it's own is 13pounds each)The lobby is small but comfortable and lovely, the elevator (only one is tiny and looks like it's 100 years old - and it is) Like the elevator, the hotel corridors are very plain and un-grand, the Tea area looked lovely but we did not partake.The concierge was outstanding, he arranged a private tour for us and gave us vouchers to jump the queue at several venues (saved waiting in line) (ie) London Dungeons, we handed our Savoy voucher to the person at the door and were admitted immediately whereas there was a huge line up - at least an hours wait at the door to get in.The Concierge also arranged dinner at Simpson's in the Strand and told us we would be receiving one of the coveted booths and free champagne for being a Fairmont President's Club member, however on arrival we were just seen to a regular table in the centre of the restaurant and nothing special was done for us. I didn't say anything at the restaurant as I didn't feel like champagne anyway (we had just had drinks at the American Bar) but I did mention it to the concierge when he asked how dinner was and he was so apologetic and promised me something wonderful to make up for it if/when I stayed at the Savoy again in the future. Total for 2 drinks at the American bar = 26 pounds.The location of the Savoy is very convenient to the theatre district - you can walk instead of taking cabs. We saw Lion King, Mamma Mia, Phantom of the Opera &amp; Mary Poppins, you are about a 5 minute walk from Charing Cross Station, 8 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and loads of restaurants like Pizza Express (which we loved)There is also a little Tesco express where you can get soft drinks, snacks, sandwiches, muffins etc... very inexpensively to avoid the high cost of room service. There is a Cafe Nero, &amp; Starbucks within a 2 minute walk as well.All and all a great stay at the Savoy and I would definately recommend it, we were in room 404 looking out into the street &amp; office building next to us. There are river view rooms available for booking at a high cost.See our photos"
51,1270,"Aug 24 2006 	I rate this Number 1!	Finding a good hotel in London is as difficult as finding a good one in New York, but after countless visits to the UK over many years I have finally found the ideal hotel, The Savoy. It is ideally located on The Strand within minutes walking of several Underground train stations, theatres, Regent Street shops, and the lively Soho area. Remembering that everything is expensive in London, The Savoy represents excellent value. Despite many of the rooms and hallways needing refurbishment, the overall feel is of enduring quality, spotless cleanliness and service excellence. There are similarly priced nearby hotels that are newer or more hip, but my experience tells me that these are mostly a triumph of style over substance. And it is in the delivery of substance that The Savoy excels. The Savoy offers an excellent fitness facility gratis, several restaurants, access to high speed internet (prior to booking, become a member of the Fairmont Presidents Club and get this free, along with local calls), delicious food (the River Restaurant has an incredible buffet breakfast and the Savoy Grill is an experience not to be missed), and last but not least, warm friendly and abundant service. I have just spent a week at this hotel and it was far better than reviews here suggest. If you want a renovated room, then ask for it, but chances are it will have a limited view as was my experience until I was immediately offered the alternative of a junior suite overlooking the Thames. The suite wasnt renovated but it didnt really need it. In fact, the hotels charm is its original art deco features evident in the light fittings, patterned carpets, chrome door surrounds, etc. Also notable are Georgian style antiques in rooms and hallways, spacious rooms decorated in the Adam style with wall panels and elaborate architraves and cornices, and on the walls are extensive artworks some of which are for sale. In keeping with its Gilbert and Sullivan origins, in many ways it is a quirky hotel with a veritable labyrinth of passage ways that can seem gloomy, obscure entrances, and old elevators, including one with a red lacquered interior reminiscent of something out of The Mikado. This hotel certainly clicked with me and I will be staying there whenever I visit London."
52,1270,"Aug 23 2006 	No as good as it was	We stayed one night as we were attending a party and the Savoy was very close by. We booked two Fairmont rooms a twin and a double. The double was large the furniture in good condition, the bed was very comfortable, however the bathroom looked a bit tired - large chip in the bath showing raw metal. The main problem was that the room has a connecting door with the next room and the occupants had the TV on all the time - even when we arrived back at 2am... as well as a very small child.The double had fruit and chocolates and a complimentary bottle of water, the twin had nothing... The main corridors do not have a feel of a luxury hotel and the whole ambience of the hotel public areas is a little cold. The American Bar is the exception because it was busy and it was fun,the staff were excellent.The reception staff and the man who organises the parking were exceptional, friendly, efficient and very helpful. However I found that the staff around the main area of the hotel to be &quot;stiff&quot;, no smiles or even a nod of recognition. However the hotel is in a good position with Covent Garden only a few minutes walk. Also it is right in the theatre area.I had not stayed at The Savoy for many years (prior to its takeover by Fairmont) and it was sad that it appears to have lost the special feeling it once had as soon as you arrived inside."
53,1270,"Aug 17 2006	First time in London /Savoy	We stayed at Savoy end of July (4 days)2006. We were booked in a jr. suite, but we upgraded to a suite overlooking Thames. Our toilet broke and without sucess they were unable to fix, so they moved us to 2 room suite. (412/413) It was nice, way to big for us and bathroom was not as nice as original room. We loved the Savoy, the staff, service etc. was great. Made reservations for 4:00 Tea. Very nice but WOW expensive. Everything in London is very expensive, but when you are on vacation is OK to spurge every now and then."
54,1270,"Jul 31 2006 	Wow!	My sister, myself and my 2 small young sons stayed at the Savoy for one night in July.We booked a deal room rate and were quite obviously delighted when we arrived at reception to be told we had been upgraded to a suite overlooking the Thames! I think they took pity in the fact all four of us would have been in the one room!anyway, car was handed to the valet (so handy to have that 24 parking service) and we had lovely service up to the room.The suite was SUMPTUOUS! gorgeous carpeting, moulded ceilings, rounded windows, blackout curtains, desks, fireplace - just gorgeous! the only thing that didnt really fit was the bathroom which was decorated quite starkly and the shower head wa broken away from the wall.Room service was prompt and lovely - breakfast the next day was room service to the room. I ordered just one full breakfast and that filled the 4 of us! enough toast, croissants, juice. tea, milk and full fry up to go round!! which was handy considering the price.On checkout we were allowed to leave our baggage and car at the hotel until we collected them after being out all day in London.Really the service is outstanding, the hotel is an icon and fabulous and the prices should be high - otherwise it wouldnt be the treat its supposed to be would it ? and we'd all go every time in London! (wish we could!!)"
55,1270,"Jul 22 2006 	great service !!	A 3 night stay at the Savoy was included in our British Airways &quot;Taste of London&quot;. My wife and I were treated superbly by the entire staff. Agreed that the hotel is costly; what you receive in return is over the top service. We were fortunate to have a full breakfast for two included each day of our stay. ( about 70 plus each tab ) I was pleasantly suprised by the front desk's gesture of allowing us to have the breakfast in our room, rather than the restaurant. As we were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary, I had arranged for a floral bouquet on arrival. An oversight on my part resulted in two bouquets delivered. The hotel, however, only charged for the orginal bouquet.In addition, the concierge on duty allowed us to leave 3 pieces of luggage while we traveled to Germany. After our arrival back to London, we picked up our luggage at the hotel, with a smile and a &quot;how was your trip?&quot; from the front desk.The Savoy is central to Covent Garden, and a short walk to the Eye. IF, (and that's a big IF) you want to splurge for a special occasion, I highly recommend the Savoy..."
56,1270,"Jun 26 2006	Lovely (except the bathroom!)	We stayed at the Savoy for one night. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with everything you could wish for (at a price). The bathroom was a big disappointment. Although it was spotlessly clean there were broken tiles and it was in dire need of a make-over. The service was faultless and all staff went out of their way to make sure you were being attended to. The breakfast was served in the River Restaurant and the choices were staggering. Prices were high 5.00 for a pot of tea!! We were attending a function at the Savoy so dinner was banqueting style, but was one of the best function dinners we have ever had.The hotel is worth going to and the decor is magnificent but be prepared to pay high prices for absolutely everything except the view."
57,1270,Jun 17 2006	Pricey water!!	Don't buy the water - it's 12 a bottle!!! - rip off
58,1270,May 10 2006	Lunch at Winston Churchills Table?	My wife and I had a marvellous stay at this hotel. We had booked as we believed that it was near the Royal Opera house. It was - only a five minute walk away. We lunched in the Grill room where Winston Churchill used to dine and breakfasted in the Garden restaurant overlooking the River Thames.The service was impeccable without being overbearing and the room was charming.The downside was that it was expensive but the atmosphere was terrific and the experience worth every penny.What I cannot understand is why it is so far down on the Tripadvisor list. Please be assured a visit to this hotel is very worthwhile.
59,1270,"Apr 16 2006	The Consumate 5-red-star hotel	The Savoy is probably the most prestigious hotel in the world, and it lives up to that. Our art deco room (a free upgrade) was spacious and comfortable. The Savoy has a calm but friendly atmosphere with impeccable service throughout. Afternoon High Tea in the impressive Thames Foyer was a delight. The American Bar is lively and special -- we were entertained by an excellent young cocktail pianist who was only too happy to take requests. Breakfast in the River Restaurant, with its Thameside location and picture windows was superb with service to die for. If there is a criticism, the old plumbing perhaps could do with attention, and the windows are not particularly easy to open and close. But the Savoy has everything :- tradition, great ambience, excellent accomodation, superb service and food, and a fabulous location, especially for theatreland. For a treat stay at the very best of the best, look no further."
60,1270,"Apr 2 2006	Room with a view	I have stayed at the Savoy Hotel on a number of occasions in the last four months, although I prefer the Ritz (if you have guests who wear jeans you are liable to be thrown out of the bar, because they operate a very strict dress code. Savoy do not. Their river view suites, although expensive (expect to pay over 600 which does not include the awesome 17.5% VAT and service charges (irrespective of the size of your tips) are wonderful. Try and get room 812 (if you can) even 712 is o.k. When it gets dark outside the panorama of all the great London sights presents itself in the many lights and colours reflected by the Thames. You won't want to move away from the window, so their excellent Room Service is just what you will want. Enjoy your meal and wine without taking your eyes off the view (unless it's a romantic affair - in which case you will be able to judge which view your partner really prefers.) If he or she keeps staring at the London Eye instead of gazing into yours, you will know that it is probably a short-lived affair.The American Bar is disappointing - absolutely no atmosphere - small, cramped, stiff - could be given more ambience with more colour and better seating.Front Desk staff are superb. When you use the lift or elevator, do remember that it is the oldest (first of its kind) in the U.K. In the &quot;old days&quot; the ever-present elevator boy carried with him a regular supply of smelling salts (for the ladies) and cognac (for the gentlemen) I dare say they ought to bring back the practice (minus smelling salts and cognac) but with a glass of champagne.....Enjoy the Savoy - not many of its kind left in the world....even the old Plaza in New York is now gone. How long before the Savoy is going to be converted into apartments????"
61,1270,"Mar 3 2006 	Great Business Hotel	Stayed here the middle of February for 5 days for business. Great location near the City, the Inns of Court and easy access to Canary Wharf through the tube. The service was very good, and anything we needed, housekeeping was very prompt in delivering. The room was very clean and very large for European standards. (I sure wish I knew how to get all those super upgrades that people talk about. While our room was very nice, we had a view across an alley to the office building right next door.) We had a room with 2 very comfortable double beds, with a desk and 2 armchairs. Very nice marble bathroom with a rainshower shower head, but the bath had that funny 1/2 glass door that really doesn't keep the water in. The breakfast buffet was great, good selection of food, but way too expensive if you're not on an expense account. The Savoy Grille was excellent both for food and service, but the American Bar was overpriced, and not that special. I will definately stay here again next time I come to London, even if it's not on an expense account. We paid GBP 195/night, which was a very competitive rate for a 4-star hotel, and the hotel is worth the expense."
62,1270,"Feb 28 2006	Big Ben as my bedside clock - what could be better?	my wife's birthday, they upgraded us to a suite, it couldnt have been better, just to lay in the exceptionally comfy bed, leave the curtains open and have Big Ben as my bedside clock and the London eye lit in all its glory was worth the visit. I couldnt fault the visit, maybe some people will say its a bit tired, it is and in some hotels that would not be acceptable but here that only adds to the charm of the place."
63,1270,"Feb 24 2006 	Great standard for a hotel - terrific location service and quality	I returned to The Savoy for three nights on business and felt at home. I love the quirky bends in the hallways and search for the room as much as I am thankful for the terrific location, high quality service and great staff. This is the place to stay. You know you are in London as it has charm and style."
64,1270,"Feb 23 2006	Expensive .. but you're worth it (or don't stay there)	My husband and I stayed for ten nights at The Savoy to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful time but it's a good thing we were expecting it to be a splurge. Our room was fairly small but very elegant and beautifully decorated, and the bathroom was spectacular. Our four-year-old son was with us and had a wonderful time exploring the hotel and wearing his child-size Savoy bathrobe and slippers. The concierge staff was excellent. They arranged excellent theatre tickets for us (super-expensive tickets but the seats were great) and a babysitter. I found the staff in general to be incredibly helpful and polite. They squeezed us in for spur-of-the-moment afternoon tea when all the tables were booked, offered us a kitchen tour when we ate at the Grill, were delightful with our four-year-old and handled taxis, packages, laundry, etc. with perfect efficiency. As other reviewers have mentioned, the room service prices are completely insane, but the breakfasts are spectacular. We figured out that ordering one full breakfast and one continental gave us a nice selection of food for the three of us and was slightly less expensive. Everything cost more than you can possibly imagine it would (we never got used to the prices in ten days there) but I didn't feel that anything was completely outrageous except the phone charges. You're better off renting a cell phone from them, honestly. Ultra luxury and comfort but don't go there expecting bargains."
65,1270,"Feb 13 2006	A memorable stay if a bit tired in places	I took my fiancee to the Savoy for a one night stay, booked at a very reasonable price on the internet. Both of us were looking forward to the experience and in general it didn't disappoint. We were offered an upgrade at check-in and ended up with a suite on one of the upper floors. It was very comfortable as you would expect, though the decor was a bit 1970s in places. We didn't eat dinner in the Grill room but spent a pleasant evening in the bar listening to the pianist/singer. Breakfast in the morning was good if expensive (25!) with a great view over the Embankment.Staff were polite and attentive.Compared to other London 5 star hotels I have been in, the Savoy fits into a certain bracket - slightly old fashioned and a little tired in places. For some this may add to the appeal. It is certainly not as overly opulent as Claridges or the Dorchester, but a stay there is a memorable experience none the less."
66,1270,"Feb 8 2006 	Unexpected Delight	I travelled to London for business and chose The Savoy only because it happened to also be the location of the conference I was attending. I usually stay at One Aldwych or Threadneedles or somewhere else a bit more modern. I must admit how delighted I was with The Savoy. I was expecting an old-style and outdated room, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was outfitted with all the modern ammenities (including an outlet for an american plug) but still maintained the look of a classic, deco hotel. I understand that The Fairmont is updating the rooms and the hotel. (The room I stayed in had been updated.) The only negative is that the public areas badly need updating -- especially the hallways and stairways, which have dreadful carpeting, peeling paint and few paintings/decorations. The fitness center is as nice as and as large as any I've seen in London -- including t.v. screens at each workout machine (and an indoor heated pool). Lastly, the staff was terrific at every turn -- no pretentions and very helpful."
67,1270,"Jan 12 2006	The Savoy - Almost the Gold Standard!	I wanted to treat myself on my big UK journey so I booked a night at the Savoy in one of their Deluxe King rooms. I turned up at the hotel around about 9 am, just intending to drop my bags with the Concierge and then go out on a day exploring. To my surprise and pleasure I was fully checked in on the spot (amazing considering the time!) and, beat this, was upgraded to an outstanding suite with a view of the Thames River and Waterloo bridge. My room had a separate lounge room with an elegant work desk looking out on the river as well as a fireplace, sofa lounge, armchairs and an armoire holding the TV and bar fridge. The large bedroom had an extremely comfortable bed, large wardrobe space and an armchair. The bathroom was all marble and glass with a very luxurious rainfall shower, toilet and bidet, heated towel rack, large well lighted mirror and spacious bench space. Toiletries were top-notch. Housekeeping visited twice a day, refreshed my toiletries and turned down the bed in the evening.I was almost tempted to shrug off the day's exploring to just relax around my room. I was so pleased I gave the guy who checked me in 20 pounds as a thank-you.While at the Savoy I used the room service (which was expensive but very good), had dinner at the Savoy Grill (expensive but nice although I just didn't quite feel comfortable), and used their high-speed Internet (which wasn't bad price-wise). I also got some of my clothes dry cleaned and laundered which was expensive (but which hotel doesn't price gouge for this service) but they came back so beautifully presented that I didn't mind the price.The only thing that I could say was a minor irritation was that Housekeeping was rather keen to get me out of my room the morning of my check-out as they came by to ask me three times when I was leaving despite the answer being the same each time.All in all however I consider my experience at the Savoy a benchmark by which to judge other five star hotels and I would happily stay there again."
68,1270,"Dec 22 2005	Magical Stay	Even before we arrived, we were treated to great service. The concierge (Mr. Mitchell) desk helped us in getting a driver to pick us up at Heathrow, got us Soccer tickets and suggested several other nice things to do. Check in was easy and we were escorted to our suite and given all kinds of information about our room and the area. A wonderful bowl of fruit and a welcoming candy tray were waiting for us. We had everything we needed taken care of whenever we needed it. My wife needs distilled warm water for her medication every morning and night and they gladly brought it to her within minutes of our call. We ate at the Banquette restaurant and enjoyed it as we had some crazy hours and needed to eat dinner at 11 PM most nights. The food was very good. Whenever we came in or left the hotel we were greeted warmly and most of the time we were addressed by name. We had a great suite and they told us that there are more refurbishments to rooms happenning now. The location is very good as you are a short two block walk from Covent Garden and a ten minute walk to Trafalgar Square."
69,1270,"Nov 1 2005 	outstanding service	I can not say enough about the wonderful treatment we received here at the Savoy. Our bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave. We were on the 9th floor and it was very quiet. We had a huge bathroom with wonderful soap and shampoo. The staff could not do enough for you and the evening turndown service with fresh towels was just an added plus. My only small disappointment was work being done next door was a little noisy but didn't start till after 10:00 a.m. It is a great hotel and being in the middle of the theater district was the best location in London, I think."
70,1270,"Oct 26 2005	Food Poisoning	I went out to The American Bar at The Savoy Hotel for drinks . I did not stay at the hotel. We all ordered cocktails - but I was the only one to order a fruit cocktail. This was at 10pm, by 4 am I was vommiting. I continued to vommit through till 7pm the following night. I actually think the fruit juice must have been off. I spent a lot of money there and not neccesarily impressed to spend the next day in the bathroom. Just wondered if anyone else has had same problem. When I mention I got food poisoning at the Savoy, people look at me in disbelief - but they didn't spend 15 hours hovering around the bathroom door!"
71,1270,"Oct 1 2005	Nostolgic and unique	We paid a fair price for our room. When we arrived our room was not ready. The person at the front desk sent us out till it was ready. We were sooooo sleepy from our flight. We walked from coffee shop to coffee shop to stay awake! They did hold our luggage... when we returned the manager appologized and gave us an upgrade suite with a river view. It was fantastic.! The breakfasts were excellent... They accommodated our every need. Forget their massages..not up to par. The workout room was great and service was spectacular! Love the ambiance... The Grill was also excellent! as was the bar. What is also great is the location near theatre.. and of course the Savoy Theatre.. we loved the prints and drawings of actors from the past... 100 yrs + it added a great deal to the atmosphere... Is it worth staying again! Oh Yes! Service was outstanding despite the rather mixed up reception at the beginning.. Savoy made up for the inconvenience.If you love history, theatre, service, excellent cuisine...Savoy should be a consideration."
72,1270,"Sep 12 2005	Loved the Savoy!	We began our trip to the UK with an overnight at the Savoy, simply because it is very central and now affiliated with Fairmont - a chain well regarded in North America.What a lovely way to start a vacation! Superb service, and a charming hotel. And we had time to try their afternoon tea - something not to be missed, even if you don't stay here.We did upgrade to a suite, courtesy of some Fairmont coupons, and had an enormous and well appointed room overlooking the Thames. Can't wait to go back and stay even longer!"
73,1270,"Aug 31 2005	Loved the Savoy	We stayed at The Savoy over New Year's 2004-05 and were blown away by this incredible hotel.The room, first of all, was goreous and charming. Probably one of the largest bathrooms I have ever seen in a hotel room, let alone in London! It had marble floors, a rain showerhead and tub so long it accomodated my 6'4'' fiance. We were in heaven. We went to Paris overnight and returned for one night before our flight home. We stayed in an even larger, nicer room than before. We couldn't believe how lovely.As for the service, we were very needy patrons at the concierge desk, and they were more than obliging. We got several great restaurant recommendations, they got us a dinner reservation last minute on New Year's Eve, theater tickets and into tea at one of the fanciest places in town on New Year's day (their tea service was booked). We were more than impressed.We checked out the gym on our last night and were so disappointed we had not seen it sooner - it was totally state-of-the-art.Highly, highly, highly recommend."
74,1270,"Aug 19 2005 	shabby	I stayed for three nights in a supposedly superior room at over 300 per night. The room overlooked a courtyard full of pipes and grotty machinery with a noisy aircon unit just outside my window. I was promised a king size bed - what i actually got were two beds pushed together, all night i kept falling bewteen them. The bathroom radio didnt work and when I turned the tap of the bath, rusty water poured out. The corridor carpets are worn and the whole place needs a revamp. It simply isnt worth the extra cost if you are looking for something a little special (which it isnt) and I get the impression the hotel is resting on its name. The Grill and the American bar have great atmospheres, but as a staying guest at the hotel you dont get any special privaleges. I was turned away from the bar at around 7pm because it was too full - generally with people off the street who have come in for a drink but are not staying. The mangement need to sort their act out if the hotel has any chance of surviving. I would happily go there to eat but not ever again to stay."
75,1270,"Jul 22 2005	never again	This once gracious hotel has fallen on hard times and is horribly mismanaged. Pay attention to what they are charging you. Make sure that you have a hard copy of your confirmation with you and check that you are being charged that room rate. Odds are you are not. Also, you must request a preliminary copy of your final bill. The desk staff will attempt to keep you from reviewing the bill but check it carefully. There were errors of close to $800 on my bill."
76,1270,"Jul 14 2005 	Service? What Service?	Service, service, service! That's something the elegant, prestigious, famed Savoy knows nothing about. It truly is a beautiful historic hotel, but it's too bad that the people think they're doing you a favour by letting you stay there. From the very beginning, they don't tell you what their address is. Because if you don't know where the &quot;Strand&quot; is in London, you just aren't good enough to be there. I got lost finding it because even a Londoner gave me the wrong directions.The bathrooms are moderm but of old-world design. It's great to simply soak in the big tubs after a long day.But customer service leaves much to be desired. I was charged a higher rate than what my travel agent had booked. I was given someone else's bill for express check-out. I was billed for a paper that I didn't want. And then they have the nerve to add on a &quot;Discretionary Service Charge&quot; - a tip - without my asking. The staff that i encountered was snotty when I pointed out a mistake in my bill. They are so sure of their righteousness. They're living in the past."
77,1270,"Jul 13 2005 	Unequivocably NOT Worth The Money	This is no where near a 5 star or even 4 star hotel. The fridge on my mini bar was broken for three days and even though they checked to charge me if I had eaten anything, it did not occur to them to fix it. Yes, I know I should have asked and it obviously didn't bother me that badly because I kept forgetting to tell the desk, but a 5 star hotel would have fixed this without me complaining. Then my toilet started leaking water all over my bare feet (needless to say I was not pleased). Then I asked housekeeping for a lint brush and no one knew what that was (the fact that very few of the staff spoke sufficient English was likely the problem). The common areas seemed dingy as well. The concierge only gave recommendations from a well worn copy of Zagat's and seemed to have no personal knowledge about what was going on in the city.That said...the bed was really comfortable and the room was a good size. The American Bar was fun. They fixed things when I remembered to ask. The doormen were quite pleasant.But given my issues, I would not have paid the amount of money if I weren't at a conference in the hotel. Claridge's, the Connaught, the Mandarin Oriental, to name a few....there are a lot of better choices."
78,1270,"Jun 30 2005	Will Not be Returning	We stayed at the Savoy last year, a surprise birthday gift from my husband and even more of a celbration as I just discovered I was pregnant. The stay was superb, despite the first room being tatty...the helpful staff quickly changed rooms and provided a bottle of Lauren-Perrier.This year we returned with our four month old son, booked directly with the hotel this time and upgraded the room.How disappointed. we checked in 10 mins before 2pm, but still our room was not ready &quot;a problem with the room&quot; we were told. I had booked an early check-in. I explained that we had a 4 month old and that we had been travelling since 6am and would need a room pronto....with reluctance a room was found. It was lovely, however, London was 32C and the room had NO AIRCONDITIONING! I politley exaplined that we would require the rrom to have functional AirCon and reminded them that there is Medical Evidence to support that infants sleeping in rooms above 18C are at risk of Cot Death and once more with reluctance the Supervisor suggested a new room would be found.We returned to the room one hour later after a walk around Penhalligons in Covent Garden and discovered that our luggage (which was in the previous room ) had gone missing! We had reservations for Afternoon Tea in the thames foyer at 1630hrs, it was now 1610hrs with only 20 mins to get changed and refreshed. With no sign of the luggage I returned to reception and their very helpful Customer Relations Manager (Isabelle) comp'd the Afternoon Tea and arranged for our luggage to appear and a suite to be arranged.After tea I thought all my Christmasses had come at once. The suite was fantastic with a view directly over the London Eye. The room was hot but we were assured the aircon worked.....famous last words. At 9pm the room was a sauna and my &quot;GroBag&quot; thermometer showed that the room was far too hot for our son to sleep in....over 27C. Once more called down to reception and minutes later 3 fans arrived!!!!!!!!!!Martino the night manager was fantastic, even to the point of assissting in finding us alternative hotel accomodation. We were at 11pm....phew...in bed in the smallest room in the hotel, not what I had booked, but with functional aircon. He informed me that the whole hotel had had no aircon for the past three days and only some rooms were now working.I beleived that the staff should have had the integrity to inform us of this at time of check-in. Our first night was a disaster and the following night (also complementary as a result) was tinged bitter sweet. With Health and Safelty issues this hotel needs to remeber that its customers comfort is priority. people may visit the Savoy on the basis of its great name (and location) but they also want to have the facilities advertised functional and to hand. This did not happen on our stay and as a result, more so, of the unforthcoming reception staff my family will not be returning.However, the restaurant staff...Thames Foyer, Riverview and the Grill are superb and cannot be faulted. A pity the reception staff could not take a leaf out of their book."
79,1270,"Jun 24 2005	Great London Itinerary	Since I have enjoyed and benefited from so many reviews when planning my trips, I decided to write a review upon my return from London (where my husband and I spent a week this past April). You should note that since everything was rather expensive in London when we traveled there, we decided to focus our spending on the sites and attractions. I had also been to London before and did not remember being so impressed by the cuisine.Thursday: Arrrived in London early in the morning. Checked into the Savoy Hotel (a great hotel in a great location!). Purchased tickets for a show (On The Town). Headed to Trafalgar Square, then walked along Whitehall Street (using the Rick Steeves book as a guide). Toured Westminster Abbey (using Steeves book as a guide). Had coffee at the cloisters (where they have a snack shop). Checked out Big Ben and Parliament from Westminster Bridge. Headed back to the hotel before heading out for an early dinner (fish &amp; chips) and the show. Our only mistake: seeing a show the first night we arrived. We were so tired!!!Friday: Headed out to the Tower of London. Purchased tickets at the Tower Hill tube stop because we were told there would be lines at the Tower. There were no lines. Headed to the crown jewels first because we were told there would also be lines there later in the day. That was true!! We went on a Yoemen tour, which I think are given every 1/2 hour, but I could be wrong. The tour was very entertaining - don't miss it!! We then went to the Imperial War Museum. Don't miss the Holocaust Memorial at the Museum, which is one of the best I've seen anywhere in the world!!!!!! We spent a lot of time at this Museum (more than the guidebooks estimated). If you are a history buff - plan on spending a lot of time here. We met friends from London for dinner.Saturday: Went to the Cabinet War Rooms/Churchill Musuem. Definitely purchase the audio guide here. Once again - if you are a history buff, you will spend a lot of time here. We then took a boat to Greenwich (took the tube back), where we saw the Royal Naval College (don't miss!), National Maritime Museum (great for kids, otherwise rather boring), Old Royal Observatory (interesting), Cutty Sark clipper ship (but did not pay to go on it), and the market (nothing special). We probably enjoyed the boat ride out to Greenwich, more than our time spent there. We could have probably skipped this side trip. We met our London friend for dinner. We had Indian food, apparently a must in London. We also went to the Tate Modern museum, which is open late on Sat nights. When going to the Museum, be sure to cross over the Millennium Bridge!Sunday: Went to the British Museum (a must see!!!). The guidebooks provide more than enough info about this place - in short, don't miss it!!!!! We spent the rest of the day relaxing, which we needed after our busy first few days. We went to Hyde Park (saw Speakers Corner, had a picnic, walked around, and just enjoyed a beautiful day with the locals).Monday: Went to the British Library - fascinating!! Then went to Windsor Castle. There is not much to see in the town (tourist shops), but the Castle is interesting. We went on the free tour of the grounds, which is short and interesting. Make sure to take photos at the front of the Castle before leaving.Tuesday: Went to Buckingham Palace for the changing of the guard - must arrive by 10:30 am to get a good spot. Of course - this is the most &quot;touristy&quot; thing we could do, but it was still fun. Took the tube to Harrods (check out the smaller version of adult cars in the toy section and the Diana/Dodi memorial if of interest to you). Went to St. Martin-In-The Fields for a 1:00 pm free concert - so relaxing and beautiful. Had lunch in the Cloisters (per Steeves suggestion). We had doubts about lunch, but it was one of the best meals of our trip! I realize that does not say much given my comments about our spending at the beginning of this review. So don't go out of your way to eat there, but if in the area, stop by. Then went to the National Gallery, after which we walked around the high end shopping area. Then headed to back to the hotel to get ready to return to NY.We were obviously very busy in London, but had a great time! Enjoy!"
80,1270,"May 31 2005	extremely accommodating service	My husband and I stayed at The Savoy over Memorial Day week-end, and could not get over how helpful the staff was..even before we left home we were in touch with the concierge, who gave us ideas of what to see and do in London, being that it was our first trip there.We ordered room service for breakfast one morning, placing the order with the front desk the night before. My husband requested grape jelly with the meal. Not only was the breakfast brought to the room exactly on time, but the chef had looked up a recipe for the grape jelly on line, and they made it from fresh grapes, which took 1-1/2 hours to make. Fantastic!! Over and above normal accommodating service.Definately recommended as a comfortable , wonderful place to stay!Congratulations, Fairmont!!"
81,1270,"May 13 2005	London needs Fairmont!	We stayed at the Savoy in February having booked a great rate of 129 + VAT for our room. We were being very annoying guests even before we arrived, as we e-mailed the hotel on a few occasions changing our room package twice!! The staff member we were in contact with couldn't be more helpful, and didn't once give us the impression our requests and questions were a nuisance. He even upgraded us to a Deluxe Room (four room categories up). We are members of Fairmont's President's Club, which does mean that little bit extra personal service, but it is exactly that kind of service at many Faimront Hotels that keep us coming back again and again, and how excited we were when they took over the Savoy!! The hotel did have a certain faded elegance, but give me that over such out of keeping renovations as the Waldorf. Plus Fairmont are spending millions this year, so I am confident anything that needs updating will soon be done. Our room was tastefully decorated, with high ceilings and a nice view from two windows up the Thames towards St Pauls. The size was perhaps not terribly huge, perfectly adequate even with a cot put in the room for our baby daughter. The service whilst at the hotel was great - Ronald at Reception was particularly attentive and engaging, and we chatted to him on checking out about Fairmont's plans. We were slightly disappointed not to have a cocktail in the Thames Foyer before dining out (we were not allowed in the American Bar with our baby) as all tables were reserved - we would know next time to book a table even for cocktails. However we did make a point of having a cocktail on our return, and they did not disappoint. All in all I plan to return - London needs a forward thinking hotel group like Fairmont to take over a Landmark Hotel like the Savoy - landmark hotels are what they do best. Oh and just one other little point - there is no charge for turndown as stated in one other review - 35?, that would definitely have given me a sleepless night!"
82,1270,"May 8 2005	Not quite the luxury you hope for	We stayed at the hotel for one night on an excellent deal. I informed the hotel it was for my husbands birthday and they were good enough to upgrade us which was an unexpected excitement. Our room was an art deco style room but felt a bit shabby and unloved. It felt like redecoration was due. We swam in the pool which was unusual colours and quite fun. The food and service were excellent. All in all, very nice but not top notch."
83,1270,"May 5 2005	Mega Style and Glamour	Just returned from London and a stay at the Fairmont Savoy. Very high standards are maintained at this first class hotel. The best of everything is what you can expect if you are like me and insist on perfection. Frette sheets, rain shower marble bathrooms with the very best towels that money can buy. Fresh Flowers in every room and throughout this landmark hotel. If you can afford it and want to indulge yourself stay at this hotel."
84,1270,"Apr 24 2005	Needs a revamp	The Savoy needs a serious revamp, The rooms are not up to scratch and for the price it is a bit depressing, the balcony for our room was a disgrace, dead birds, broken glass, paint peeling from the exterior walls amongst other things.I will say though the American Bar is fantastic the dry martini was invented there. the pianist (mauro monturo) is amazing, you name it he can play it, but alas the bar and the food can not make up for the rooms, oh and the fact that they charge 35 to turn the bed down.go to the dorchester, connaught or claridges some of which are from the same group but are of a higher standard"
85,1270,"Mar 28 2005 	Excellent luxurious stay	Stayed at the Savoy for a week on business in March 2005. Truly luxurious, not a single fault. Service is impeccable, extensive in-dining choices, huge breakfast, lovely rain showers. I will stay there as often as possible when I come for business."
86,1270,"Feb 25 2005	Had a lovely stay...	We stayed one night (18th February), having booked a special offer deal via Fairmont's website. Our room was 617, and had a fabulous view of St Pauls, the Oxo tower, and Canary wharf in the distance. It even had a balcony, locked on our arrival, but swiftly opened on request. The reception staff were lovely, service fast &amp; professional. There is a certain faded grandeur about the Savoy - though it certainly didn't extend to our room - but you don't go to the Savoy for an identikit 5-star &quot;look&quot;. The old art deco is the point, surely...."
87,1270,"Feb 18 2005	Disappointing	We stayed here for just one Sat night in Feb 05. Stayed in Junior river view suite on 8th floor - 816. Room was at far left of hotel with good views over to South Bank and up river to Houses of Parliament. Spacious entrance lobby, smallish bedroom to left but with oodles of wardrobe and drawer space. Very comfortable bed (double not King size though) and excellent pillows. Curtains a bit weary looking around the edges but other soft furnishings OK. Wardrobes hv seen better days. Bathroom - fairly large with good rainfall shower but bit austere and with no wow factor (bathrooms have to have a wow factor for me!). Sitting room to left of entrance lobby was large and well furnished but just faintly worn about the edges. Metal framed windows were not great - pretty old double glazing affair with flaking mortar and paint in between panes and definitely might be difficult to shut if you didn't have strong pair of hands! Hum from traffic below was fairly constant but not obtrusive. Atmosphere of suite was like staying at home of Great Aunt - bit faded around the edges but comfortable and homely. Corridors of hotel again bashed about the edges a bit, look in need of refurbishment. Public areas good - love them or hate them I think - lots of chocolate, beiges and browns. American Bar I found disappointing. Obviously outrageously expensive but cocktails good - but why should we have to remind waiter after 15 minutes that he hadn't yet brought the second round of drinks we'd ordered - I expect better service than that for 12 a cocktail! Savoy Grill - fabulous room setting lovely banquettes and circular tables - good ambience and lighting. We had taster menu at 65 per head which was only OK. Main course was good (not amazing) but rest of dishes were only OK - how disappointing is that? Service was outstanding though. (I have to say that apart from the bar waiters who were pretty poor the entire hotel staff were friendly and extemley professional and helpful). Also had lunch in the informal restaurant overlooking entrance - fixed price for 2 or 3 courses - extremley good value and excellent food. Would I stay here again? No. At over 350 for the room, over 240 for a meal for 2 (albeit including a bottle of champagne and half bottle of wine) with the final bill for one night's stay coming out at about 800 and when you consider little things like the poor service in the American Bar, wrong newspaper delivered to our room, having to wait over 15 minutes for them to bring our car round when we checked out - I haven't come away with any special memories except how large that bill was.."
88,1270,"Feb 1 2005	purse went missing mice problem horrible room and service	If you had a choice, please, don't even think of staying at The Savoy. I think it's a hotel for people who don't know better. Well, I was one, for sure.I'm originally from Asia, but have lived in the States for decades now. For Christmas, my wife and I decided to go to London but could not get a room at Mandarin Oriental. So we got a room at The Savoy for 2 nights till Mandarin Oriental became available. We had heard of Savoy but never stayed there, so we were excited. --Big mistake. We should have just delayed our trip and never stayed at The Savoy.We booked a deluxe room with a King size bed, which turned out to be a dump.Here are problems we had at The Savoy:-scornful welcome upon checking in. Their comment: &quot;You travelled all the way from Asia just to stay with us?&quot; Upon our telling them we live in the States, &quot;Oh, American... well, you will enjoy our culture here.&quot; All the comments were so scornful and totally uncalled for. -Stained, really dirty carpet in our room-Stained (brownish spots) bedspread-Frayed sheets-Squeaky bed-Towel hanger barely hanging off the bathroom wall-Basin that took 1 hour to drain fully-Constant change of scorching and cold water when showering-Closet door's hinge broken, later it fell apart-Greasy doorknobs-MICE -The Savoy has mice problems, especially in the kitchen (I found this out after contacting a travel agency later.) No wonder my asthmatic wife kept coughing and wheezing so badly.-SECURITY ISSUES -someone had gone through our personal stuff (luckily for us, we had put our Rolex, Cartier, all the jewelry pieces, cash and passports in the safe the night before.) and jammed my wife's empty party purse under the bed's leg. Hotel claimed that she was just being forgetful! (Who would place a purse under bed's leg and forget about it?) WE CHECKED OUT IMMEDIATELY, CANCELLING THE REST OF OUR STAY. We haven't seen the refund for the cancelled stay till this day. (We had paid for the room in full via expedia, but The Savoy said they would 'personally guarantee to refund a one night's stay in the name of Savoy' but hasn't done so. We are currently disputing via AMEX.)So, please, do not even consider staying at The Savoy. This hotel is a has-been. In our grandparents' age, it was a really good hotel. My grandparents had a really fantastic 2-week stay there decades ago. Now it's a total touristy place for people from that period and tourists who have heard of its glorious past, unaware of what it is now. If you are still going to stay at The Savoy, please be sure to put your stuff in the safe. That way, you have some protection. Also, upon being led to a dirty (they may claim the room is just historical, such as our case) room, please ask for another room. If you are asthmatic, don't stay at The Savoy. My wife's asthma attacks completely stopped upon checking out. Enjoy your trip to London!"
89,1270,"Jan 29 2005	Charming romantic and of course it's old	I've lurked &amp; exploited tripadvisor long enough (thanks, all!); it's time for me to weigh in, hoping to balance this discussion.Yes, the Savoy is old. If you seek modern sleek splendor do go elsewhere. But for old-style charm, grand public spaces (lobbies, cloakrooms), and immaculate service, you can't do much better.Our old room did have some small carpentry &amp; plumbing glitches. The place doesn't need renovation so much as two hours of minor repair. But the old room also entailed lovely fixtures &amp; cabinetry, and the largest bathtub I've ever soaked in.Staff were very polite, despite prior reviews. The Fairmont chain purchased the Savoy days before our arrival, so I doubt they get much credit for that. I do hope they don't modernize. We did wish they were better-informed re area attractions, and the new management brings some new staff. Don't expect much local knowledge from the American accents!Yes, our elevator (ahem, &quot;lift&quot;) was a bit slow &amp; quirky (&quot;when WILL that door close?&quot;), but I would rather put up with that, than lose the opportunity to ride the oldest lift in England.If you book through a package, you'll get no view. Try to get a high floor regardless; it'll be better air &amp; light that way.Healthclub is modernized. Wish we had made time for it. Didn't dine in the hotel, except for an excellent but wildly expensive breakfast.If you go: Heathrow express is fastest/nicest way, but you still need to tube or taxi the rest. Piccadilly-line underground is fastest/easiest (Covent Garden stop is a short walk). Taxi is for wasting time &amp; money.Nearby, do shop at the original Twinings. Don't miss the Temple Inn &amp; Church. Eat at Simpsons, if you really want full-retro English."
90,1270,"Dec 27 2004	Unpleasant food and service at times.	The Savoy has a tremendous reputation - perhaps now that there are different owners it will buck up a bit.One of the worst restaurant experiences I had in my life was being overcharged at one of the premiere Savoy restaurants - it ruined what was a disappointingly boring meal, a bottle of champagne that was not properly chilled, and suspect as well as the cork was not popped at the table and was loose in the bucket; and insolent rude service which was unexpected and patronizing. The kitchen appeared to make no great effort and the prices were astronomical. At other times dinners were not at all remarkable.I have hope that things have changed as it is a lovely historical place and brilliantly situated, and the front-line staff make great efforts, but one has a sense that there is a long way to go. Bear in mind that many of the rooms are not as large as they were in our parent's or grandparent's times, and have been divided again. As well the standard of service is now aimed more towards businessmen on large accounts and represents a lesser kind of clientele socially. It is not a place where one's old memories are happily rekindled.The ferris wheel apparatus across the river as well has spoiled the view.Smaller boutique hotels that try harder are within five minutes walk on the Strand. The Ritz is another option."
91,1270,"Dec 27 2004	Wonderful Hotel	We just got home after staying 5 nights at the Savoy, plus I had my mother and sister join for a night. We all loved it.The hotel is a classy place with a very nice lobby and beautiful rooms. After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous - but having spent my earlier years in London prior to coming to the States I was determined! Service was excellent with room service in 10 minutes or less. All our rooms (4) were beautifully decorated in classic art deco style with THE most comfortable beds. Bathrooms in marble etc with superb direct down overhead showers. Afternoon tea was excellent for both quality and service. I saw nothing jaded or threadbare in the areas I was in - except the first elevator we went down in in that turned out to be a barebones service elevator direct to the kitchen I think!. It is not the &quot;Grand Entry&quot; style of modern hotels such as a Grand Hyatt with 20 stories of lobby, rather it is more on the elegant side and it has apparently been recently redecorated. The only bad/irritating experience I had was one doorman last Wednesday evening when he was chatting on the phone rather than getting me a taxi - I had to walk 50 feet to get my own taxi. Which is why I almost could not quite give 5 the stars - but is anybody really perfect?. Not that you always need a taxi -Chicago and Stomp are playing literally across the street and Covent Garden and Leicester Square real close. Everybody else in the hotel was always very helpful (including all the other doormen)I will definitely be back there."
92,1270,"Nov 29 2004	Swanky Savoy	Stayed at the Savoy while on vacation in London in late October and truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were very courteous and friendly. The room was &quot;roomy&quot;; very comfortable bed, sofa couch in front of the TV, bed turndown service. The bathroom was large and beautiful; marble everywhere, towel warmer, separate bath and shower, vertical rainfall showerhead. The Savoy lobby and hotel driveway were classically stylish. Only one neg: Due to the exchange rate, found it difficult to eat at the hotel's restaurants due to the high price. Perhaps a casual coffeeshop would be a welcome addition. Lots of other places to eat nearby the hotel though. The hotel location was awesome. 3 minute walk to the Underground(Charring Cross, Covent Garden). Hotel is right on the Strand and just below Covent Garden. Many theatres and shops close by. A busy enough area but not &quot;too&quot; busy. Would love to stay there again sometime soon. Made our trip to London even more memorable."
93,1270,"Nov 23 2004	Love It!	We have stayed here several times in a range of their rooms (depending on funds)! The suite we had overlooking the Thames was wonderful, while the standard rooms we have stayed in do tend to be smallish and dark - they are still well furnished. The bathrooms never disappoint - I love the marble baths and have to spend several hours luxuriating.The Grill restaurant is stunning - service is excellent and the food is heaven on a plate.Location is excellent.If I had to be picky then I would say the American Bar is small and uncomfortable. But the lounge area is great and the staff friendly and helpful."
94,1270,Oct 13 2004	Over Priced	The Savoy is well situated for most attractions. However The Savoy is really living on a past reputation of 20 years ago or more. The hotel is very tired looking with thread bare carpets and depressing decoration.The good points about the hotel apart from location is that the staff are very friendly and efficient and the food in all the restraunts was also very good.It is not a hotel that I would recomend or go back too as I think you can get better deals at far better hotels in London. We stayed there in October 2004.
95,1270,"Sep 23 2004 	Nice location rooms on the shabby side	I stayed at the Savoy in London for two nights in September, 2004.The location was great. It was right across from Covent Garden, close to many attractions, and in the Theatre district for those that are interested.The staff was excellent. Quiet, efficient, polite.Room service was efficient, the food was good, and for London, the cost was reasonable.My complaint about that hotel is not that anything was wrong with it really, it is just such an expensive hotel with this reputation for being one of the finest, and it simply isn't that. The rooms are a fair size and there is high-speed internet access for those that would like it. However, the ceilings and walls are dirty, and the paint is peeling in some areas.If you are thinking of treating yourself to a top notch hotel, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. If you want a hotel in a great location with good staff, I would say you might love your stay."
96,1270,"Sep 21 2004	Enjoyed the Savoy	I really enjoyed the Savoy. I paid 75 pounds for a car to pick me up which was very convenient and the driver was very nice and informative. When I arrived they had upgraded my room and somebody showed me around the hotel and made sure everything was in order. The hotel is pretty much in the center of London. I took a cab or walked everywhere. And take a boat ride on the Thames. I took one to the Tower of London and you can get some great pictures. At the Savoy everyone was very friendly from the doormen to the front desk. The only drawback I had was at the cashier's desk when they said something was wrong w/my credit card. It was actually a debit card and they made a big deal about it, not sure why. Might be b/c they couldn't take out the money all at once, I don't know. But it really annoyed me and upset me b/c they made it out to be my problem which it wasn't. And also watch out for the phone charges. I had a phone card and still got charged an arm and a leg. My longest call, 17 min., cost me 198 pounds. But besides those couple of snags the Savoy is really very nice and you might see a couple of famous people. I had just missed seeing Nicholas Cage by 10-15 minutes."
97,1270,"Sep 15 2004	Room was great hotel was okay	Stayed for 3 nights at the Savoy. The hotel location on the Strand is unbeatable. You are also sheltered by street noise since the actual building is inset from the street. As other reviewers have commented, the hotel common areas do look rather dated (carpets, elevators, furniture). The dim lighting doesn't help either. On the other hand, the ladies' cloakroom on the 1st floor is big, bright, and well-appointed. Worth a visit (women only).Our standard room had a king bed; a long mirrored writing/dressing table; generous wardrobe w/ mirrored doors; TV/mini-bar cabinet.The bathroom was a large, rectangular room that included a luxurious bathtub and rain showerhead, towel heating rack, beautiful pedestal sink, bidet, and of course, toilet. Toiletries by Floris were very welcome. The window could be opened and provided more illumination.The employees were friendly but not too knowledgeable (of Harrods closed on Sun., the Savoy pool hours). Overall, service was good. We were allowed to check in early at 11am. When we complained about a problem w/ our room, it was promptly resolved. The porter and doormen were professional.We had drinks in the American Bar (live pianist). Nice but overpriced.We did enjoy our stay at the Savoy. The only reason it didn't get a 4-star rating is because the hotel could do a bit more to modernize the older areas."
98,1270,"Sep 10 2004	Skip the Savoy	This hotel was listed as a &quot;splurge&quot; in a guidebook, so we chose it, really looking forward to the view of the Thames. There is no place in this hotel, even public rooms, that have a decent view. The room was nice, very big bathroom and comfortable bed. The location was good as well. But overall the hotel was cramped, confusing to get around in, dated, and rundown. The elevator smells like a dumpster. The prices are ABSURD. We read the room service menu and laughed like it was a joke book. Most staff were friendly with the exception of a french guy at the desk who checked us out. He was almost rude enough to write a letter about. Would never stay here again."
99,1270,"Sep 4 2004	forget it -- a waste of a huge amount of money	Stayed at the &quot;Savoy&quot; in March 2004 .This place was so disappointing --It is a dump, plain and simple. Save your money and go over to Jermyn Street to the lovely little hotel there."
100,1270,"Aug 30 2004	What a Dump!	Don't even think about it. This place relies entirely on a reputation formed long ago, which bears no relation to the reality of its present condition. Go for tea, but throw your money in the Thames before you rent a room here.For nearly 500 Pounds Sterling a night, you should probably expect more than being escorted to an occupied room, and then being led aimlessly around by a member of the front desk staff that can't even find your room.It is old, it is dirty, and entirely indifferent to the happiness of its guests. Try the Mandarin Oriental instead -- we stayed there our first three nights in London and there was no comparison."
101,1270,"Aug 8 2004	Good Location	The Savoy is a great location if you are going to see the Lion King or if you like to explore little nearby streets by Cov. Garden. As for the hotel when you walked in it had a bad smell, that didn't seem to go away. We had our kids so we had two rooms, and they were worn. The best thing about the rooms were the cozy beds, it was a fun location but I don't know if I would stay here again."
102,1270,"Jul 10 2004	All Bark and no bite	While making reservations for Tea , I was warned that jackets and ties were required and that there was a strict dress code. After coaxing my husband and son into a jacket and tie, imagine our surprise to find men wearing jeans, polo shirts, no ties and no jackets! Ladies were also dressed informally! The tea and pastries were nice, but the service was non exsistent! We had to look for the server to pay the check! Overpriced for the service and food. Dress code obviously not enforced and high tea was more like low tea!"
103,1270,"Jun 3 2004	The staff made our stay a good one.	The Savoy was our first stay in Europe May 18-May 21(we went on to France). I was expecting a nice 5 star hotel and it is. It's just not as nice as I expected. The rooms are clean with nice furniture, and great bathrooms with oversized tubs, but I don't think we got one of their better rooms from what I saw advertised on the internet. Regardless, we enjoyed our stay in London and the staff at the Savoy was especially nice to me and my wife. They made us feel very welcome there. I would stay here again if I return to London. One issue to consider is the air conditioning. We had one hot day and the AC turned up on high did little to keep the room cool. This might be an issue in the summer time."
104,1270,"Jun 1 2004	Afternoon tea was wonderful	We booked afternoon tea for a party with our friends. What a lovely afternoon. Everything to eat and drink was superb, but it's the service and ambience that made it so special. We stayed for hours, with no feeling of being rushed, and the tea, sandwiches, and pastries were supplied when requested, as much as we wanted. How different from other places I have been to!Other places may have &quot;higher ratings&quot; by reviewers, but the Savoy will always be one of my very happy memories as the staff and surroundings complemented the food to make an unsurpassable experience. Thanks to everyone there."
105,1270,May 24 2004	oh dear	Arrived to a nice welcoming but things went down from there the room was about 280 for a twin and all extras were very expensiveAfter settling in and going for a walk i returned and it took five minutes to explain i was a resident and had to show my key card to proove itFood was not bad but very little and i was forced to keep my jacket on at all times in the american bar at it was hotDont go if you want a relaxing time its far too formal and nothing special
106,1270,"May 15 2004	Disappointing	Stayed here as an experiment - not the great hotel I was expecting! Many others have better rooms, facilities, breakfasts... and the food at the Savoy Grill was overpriced and of distinctly indifferent quality (both meat and vegetarian options). Their much-vaunted cocktail bar does do good cocktails (as it should at those prices!) but the atmosphere is not up to much. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere!"
107,1270,"Apr 29 2004	Wonderful First Stay!	My first trip to the Savoy--April 2004, was a great success, and I would go again in a heartbeat. Arrived in the early morning to find that not only was the room ready early, but that it had been upgraded without request. The room itself was bright, pretty and quiet even at the back side of the hotel, the bathroom spectacular, with a tub one could drown in blissfully. The Savoy Grill was top notch, service and food both excellent."
108,1270,"Apr 26 2004	Wonderful experience	We booked the cheapest possible rate over the Savoy's website at GBP 119 and were expecting a very cramped and basic room. To my surprise, the room was roomy and beautiful, with antiques and lots of classic touches. The bathroom was spotless, huge, with lots of marble and a great shower and bath. Staff and service, expecially the concierge, were excellent, very friendly and not stuffy at all. The gym/pool were very clean and modern as well. Location is perfect for walking or taking the tube to all the sights in London.One complaint would be the outrageous room service prices for breakfast (USD 50.00 for continental breakfast for 1 person!). Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel."

1,1273,"Nov 26 2009 	Simply the best hotel we have stayed in	We visit London alot for weekend breaks and have stayed at many good hotels there including Claridges and Browns. After our visit to The Stafford this is now the only hotel we will use when in London. A hidden gem ideally located with friendly staff , gorgeous rooms and a fabulous bar. Cant wait to go again."
2,1273,"Nov 3 2009 	A sophisticated hidden gem with wonderful rooms and lovely service	We travel a fair amount and for our last weekend in London in 2009 stayed at the Berkeley where the suite we had was so outdated it looked like it was last decorated in 1985. So, we tried a completely different hotel and opted for The Stafford. Tucked away behind St James palace it's a 5 minute walk from Bond Street and light years from the Berkeley. We had one of their new mews suites and it was wonderful. Beautifully decorated, very spacious (easily suit a family with a few kids and not feel crowded) and it felt luxurious. At the price of a London suite when little details are missing it really grates, no so with The Stafford. Free soft drinks in the mini bar, night lights in the floor and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Finally the service, understated and very classy. No wonder it's a hit with the Americans. I never write reviews, but The Stafford deserves it, I had no complaints at all (rare) and recommend it."
3,1273,"Oct 30 2009 	Totally and Utterly Compelling!	Having stayed in hotels in all over the World and in particular in London The Stafford beats them all into a cocked hat! It has recently beeen bought by a wealthy private individual I am told and I see that someone has warned us all to beware. Well that is not my experience. The rooms are quite outstanding, generous in proportion with many thoughtful extras. On my last visit service was seamless. The Concierge are the most helpful and knowledgable I have come across and the American Bar has the best staff ever, mixing formality with humour in a way that has become a dying art form. I love it! The Managers are always in evidence and seem to know everyone by name which all adds to the 'home from home' atmosphere that i have yet to experience elsewhere. Every time I go it just gets better and better. No Big Shots here just wonderful hospitality in a beautiful hotel. Long may it continue."
4,1273,"Oct 29 2009 	Lovely and Perfect in Every Way	This hotel is fabulous. We stayed in one of the suites in their carriage house and it was beautiful. The room and service were fantastic. The staff really go out of their way to make you feel welcome! Also, the location could NOT BE BETTER! You are walking distance to some of the best restaurant, the Buckingham Palace, and the green park tube! You will not be disappointed!!!"
5,1273,"Oct 3 2009 	Warning - hotel has been taken over	We have been to this hotel before and found everything to be perfect. However on our most recent stay it wasn't the same. The location is still wonderful but there were little things wrong everyday. The newspaper didn't arrive the first day, we had no bath mat the second day, no face towels the next day and believe it or not no bitter in the bar (translation: bitter = real beer) on the last day. It then all became clear when the bar staff let slip that the hotel had been taken over 3 days before we arrived. Let's hope that things settle back into their old routine. The hotel is expensive so you expect things to be perfect."
6,1273,"Sep 14 2009 	World Class Hotel	The Stafford is a wonderful hotel, brimming with style and charm. The location is ideal: on a very quiet side street just a couple of minutes' walk from bustling Piccadily, not far from Buckingham Palace. The standard rooms are elegant and functional, with comfortable beds and luxurious furnishings. Service is superlative -- every member of the staff I encountered was exceedingly friendly, helpful and professional, and they really went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. The food was excellent, and room service was always prompt. Overall, one of the best hotels at which I have ever stayed."
7,1273,"Sep 8 2009 	Incredible style service. Traditional elegance. Incredible decor.	The rooms here are decorated so beautifully and individually. Real style. No fru-fru and not that antiseptic contemporary style in so many gutted old British hotels. Service was amazing. Location is just perfect. St. James's, near Buckingham, Westminter Abbey and the Churchill War Rooms. Beautiful St. James's Park down the street. Green Park tube stop right there. Hotel breakfast, though not included, is an amazing value. Best we had in Britain, including many hotels."
8,1273,"Sep 8 2009 	Adequate but not compelling	Our family of 3 stayed at the Stafford for 7 nights during the last week of August. I picked it over the Four Seasons Canary Wharf due to its great reviews and excellent location despite a much higher rate. The pre-paid non-refundable rate for a suite that accommodates my family of 3 at the Stafford was double that of the Four Seasons.The location of the hotel is indeed perfect, located in a quite back street in the very posh St James areas. Minutes to tube, theatre, shopping, parks and Her Majesty's residence.It has been many years since I visited London for pleasure and I came mentally prepared that things are expensive, compared to Asia where we live and also tothe US. Still, at 500 pounds a night I think it compares poorly with the Dar AlMasyaf Jumerirah Dubai where we vacationed earlier this year (similarly priced),not to mention Asian hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental, Aman resorts or Bayan Trees. There is nothing wrong with the hotel. The room is of a reasonable size sothat the three of us can move around without bumping into each other. I evenenjoyed the period features such as the wooden floor (instead of marble) inthe toilet and the fact that our room door doesn't open properly because itwas converted from a stable. What is lacking is warm of service. Perhapsthey were trying to emulate the feeling of service by a proper English butler.Only the youngest employees ever wore a smile (such as the young Americanlady at reception and the very green waiters in the dining room) and I dare say 7 days is a proper observation period. Compared to the Paris hotelwhere we stayed also for a week, it was miles apart but then it was ratedNo. 1 in Paris by Trip Advisor. My wife's only real complain about the hotel is the lack of an in room electric kettlefor making tea/coffee. To charge people another 5 pound for a cup of teain such an upmarket hotel is kind of parsimonious. I would not go back nor would I recommend it to a friend. As I said thereis nothing wrong with the hotel, just not my cup of tea."
9,1273,"Aug 27 2009 	Proper poise polish and panache	It was a pure delight to stay here. I had read all of the glowing reviews of the Stafford Hotel prior to booking a stay here, and our time at the Stafford exceeded my expectations in every way. This is an extremely well managed and well run proper British hotel. It's elegant and comfortable at the same time and the entire staff makes you feel right at home from the minute you walk in the door until the time you leave. From reception to the concierge desk, the bellmen and the nice people who work in the restaurant, I felt very welcome here. The central location gives you quick access to the best that London has to offer. Being adjacent to Green Park keeps things quiet at night but it's a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly, etc. (Be sure you know about the pedestrian walk-through shortcut tunnel which will save you a lot of time!) Underground stations are quite close, too and there are a number of quite nice restaurants nearby within a five minute walk. We had two connecting rooms, #216 and #217. While the rooms were certainly nice, they seemed a little &quot;crowded&quot;. Maybe one less piece of furniture would help open things up a bit to make it easier to get to the windows or walk around the room. My only &quot;complaint&quot; (and it's not much of an issue) is with the decor. The older part of the hotel seems a little matronly for my taste. I think I would have preferred the updated style and modern furnishings of a Mews unit. Perhaps next time. While the bathroom of #216 seemed to be more contemporary, the one in #217 seemed older, cramped and the shower/tub was a little awkward climbing in and out of. We ate continental breakfasts each of the five mornings we were there, and they were superb. The staff was so attentive that we felt like we were the Royal Family and being treated accordingly. We didn't eat any dinners in the restaurant at all, but enjoyed a casual meal in the American Bar. A tip of the cap to Yannick, an excellent barman who makes a wonderful Pimms Cup! Ask for a tour of the wine cellar, which has some amazing bottles and also features some very interesting World War Two memorabilia. (Apparently, it was used as a shelter during the bombings.) I did, however, find the caps hanging from the ceiling of the American Bar to be a bit gimmicky, preferring instead to study the framed historic objects on the wall and ignoring the caps that previous guests had left behind. And why is there an Oakland Raiders helmet jutting out from the wall? Strange. All in all though this is a terrific place. I looked forward to arriving and hated leaving. I hope to return."
10,1273,"Aug 21 2009 	A little corner of tranquil luxury in London	You should always get an immediate feeling you are staying somewhere that is delivering a service at the top end of their game.. An attentive doorman, hall staff standing almost to attention giving the feeling of presence, well dressed, well spoken reception teams. This place has it all. In spades. Immediately calming from the moment you step through the door, leaving the frenetic hustle of London and St James St behind you. No chinzy, mass produced vases and furniture in this lobby, all antiques and originals. My room was smaller than the major chains that sprawl around Picadilly, but as we all know size means nothing, it's the attention to design and detail that makes the mark. And that eye for detail is superb. Again, original art, decorative crematics and furniture, a BOSE audio system, branded wooden coathangers. A full marble bathroom of a refined opulence that you could almost imagine the floors below the building straining under the weight of, dressed with fine accessories from Floris. Abundance of fluffy white towels, and even a night light under the sink. The room had a large fridge stocked with complementary mineral water, and so rare in many hotels, genuinely plenty of space for your own purchases.The food was excellent on both nights I ate there, my corporate budget did't quite justify the 60 necessary for the two courses and wine in the main restaurant, however the very welcoming yet exclsuisve feeling public bar delivered some cooking with flair. I used to wondwer what a 20 'burger would taste like (paying towards the rates perhaps) however I was suprised to find that the 19 Stafford Burger was actually good value for money considering the quality of the meat and accompaniments). The pan fried calves liver was a homely and perfect as if cooked by my great Aunt with no other covers to cater for.Improvements? Now we are talking minor niggles. An i-Pod dock on the BOSE system, and a DVD player would be welcomed. And even sometimes the most well heeled traveller would prefer a kettle in the room rather than have to order room service. I'm sure that The Staffordf would make it either unitrusive or perfectly formed. Apart from that, what a brilliant hotel. The owner should be proud of their team's achievements. I only fear that I will never be able to afford a stay here unlewss it's picked up by the corporate tab. Never mind."
11,1273,"Aug 8 2009 	Ideal hotel in central London... a pleasure to stay here	A trip to London normally means business and a multi-national corporate hotel. This time the trip was personal (Royal Opera House and shopping) so I decided to treat myself to something different.From beginning to end, my stay at the Stafford was first class. The staff (especially the conceirge and in the American Bar) were by far the most polite and courteous I have ever experienced in a hotel and in London. The room, although slightly small, was ideal for me as a single traveller; quiet and cool it was lovely to come back to after a night at the opera. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of storage space (and hangers).The location is ideal, only five minutes walk into the centre of London with Green Park tube station very close by. And if you need a taxi, the porters will go out to the main street to fetch one for you... even in the pouring rain!The complimentary newspaper was also available at the weekend (how many hotels do this!). Breakfast was probably the best I have had in a hotel and had great selection available. On checkout, I discovered that there had been a communication problem between my travel agent and the hotel regarding extras included in my booking (complimentary breakfast and a credit for food in the restaurant/bar) which resulted in a higher than expected final statement. On production of my booking confirmation sheet, the hotel agreed to honour what I had expected to pay for, which meant that they lost out financially. It wasn't a large amount of money but I wouldn't expect many hotels (especially in London) to agree so readily to do this!Would I return to the Stafford? Most definitely."
12,1273,"Jul 25 2009 	Very accessable very quiet hotel with courteous attentive staff	Spent 10 nights at the Stafford in July 09.Very quiet and relaxed hotel, yet in the heart of London, with access to all of the capital, via Green Park tube. Though we walked everywhere. Visited Borough Market, Canary Wharf and all the usual sights.When you come back to the hotel, it is with a sense of delight, that you will get peace to enjoy the rest of the evening. Free Wifi and good TV channels, all of Sky Sports channels plus the business channels. Read or sleep - all possible with peace.What did we not like? Really there was nothing I can complain about. Anything we asked for was delivered immediately. The rooms are beautifully furnished. Some may be a bit smaller than rooms in the US or other cities. But this is London, and as far as I am concerned this is the city where it all happens. The bathroom was very large with a walk in shower and a bath. Towels were always hot and very comfy.Been to London twice a year for the last twenty years and this is the hotel I have been looking for. Going to go back? Yes!! August 09."
13,1273,"Jul 22 2009 	London Pride - a home that's dear to us	The Stafford oozes class and makes for a perfect weekend break. The moment your taxi draws up outside and a courteous doorman opens the taxi door and takes charge of your luggage you know you are staying at a hotel where guests' needs are paramount. At every turn there were helpful, professional staff and we were given an unhurried tour of the hotel before being shown to our (upgraded) room. The heating/air conditioning worked very effectively and though the room had double glazing, this was scarcely necessary to keep out the noise because there simply wasn't any. Despite being in the very heart of London (2 minutes from St James Palace, 3 minutes from Fortnum and Masons) tranquillity is guaranteed due to the fact that the Stafford sits at the end of a mews terrace. The room was beautifully appointed with a superbly comfortable bed - so wide I think the bedside tables were in different postcodes - and the bathroom was elegant marble with extremely fluffy towels and bathrobes and quality Floris toiletries. Room service was excellent, tea and coffee arriving almost instantly and served from stylish pots into bone china cups. A rose in the vase on the tray is a simple touch which was noted and appreciated.We ate in the American bar and it certainly lives up to its billing. It was convivial with excellent food but the main restaurant looked equally appealing and proved to be so because that is where we had breakfast next morning. Yes, you can get a much cheaper breakfast in the arcade round the corner but you pay for the style as well as the substance and the Stafford has both in spades. In some ways the Stafford reminds me of a scene from Miss Marple with its elegant yet homely atmospere but this is to ignore the fact that the hotel has also firmly embraced the 21st century with Bose CD players and free internet connections. There really is nothing to fault with the hotel; it is expensive but it's worth it. We will surely return."
14,1273,"Jul 15 2009 	Pompous attitude presentable suite	On a whim, my partner and I stayed at the Stafford this weekend, selecting a mews suite (approx 1200 per night.)The suite itself was of an excellent size, pleasantly furnished and well-maintained. The living room was somewhat too small for the amount of furniture and, really strangely, only one of the bathroom's two sinks was supplied with toiletries.We were advised on arrival that the restaurant required gentlemen to wear a jacket. A pompous attitude in the 21st Century, and I noticed in passing that there were few restaurant patrons. Quite right!Aside from a few minor oddities (DVD player in the bedroom but none in the living room; a hallway almost larger than the living room) and the most mediocre breakfast I've been served in an alleged 5-star, no major complaints. But, on the whole, the Sofitel provides superior comfort minus the attitude, and the Stafford is not somewhere I would rush back to."
15,1273,"Jun 23 2009 	Charming hotel wonderful staff	Like a country house retreat in the centre of London, so quiet you would have no idea you were so close to bustling Piccadilly, which was great as we were able to stroll to the theatre. I was only here for one night, but I found the hotel to be very welcoming and the staff friendly and helpful. The decor is very traditional, so if you are a lover of the modern look, I wouldn't recommend it, if you prefer traditional you will absolutely love it. The room is cosy and the beds are huge and ridiculously comfortable.But be warned - their famous martinis are absolutely lethal..."
16,1273,"Jun 9 2009 	Best Hotel in the World	My wife and I decided on a weekend trip to London to celebrate our 32nd Annivesary. We saw a review on the Stafford on a TV travel show and decided to try it. From the moment we arrived when Richard the manager said &quot;welcome home&quot; we felt this was something special. We were fortunate to be upgraded from a queen double to a king double.. The room was light and airy with plenty of cupboard and drawer space. The public rooms are beautiful especially the American Bar where we ate on more than 1 occasion over the 3 days. We asked Richard about the wine cellar where the American and Canadian officer sheltered in the blitz during Worls War II. He offered to take us down to view this 380 year old store. A museum has been set up with items of memorbilia which were extremely interesting. no sooner had we told the receptionist that we were celebrating, a cake appeared in out room. Even the bellman offered to walk us accross the road to show us the shortcut to Green PArk. They just seemed to want to go that extra mile. I will certainly go back when I next stay in London."
17,1273,"Apr 29 2009 	Wonderful weekend	Can't disagree with any of the glowing reviews elsewhere on the page. We were only in town for a weekend, so thought we'd treat ourselves; and the Stafford proved well worth it. Welcoming staff, extremely well-appointed room (especially after finding we'd received an unexpected upgrade) and brilliant location. Can't comment on the food, as we had dinner plans of our own on the Saturday, and had our Sunday breakfast round the corner at the Wolseley (also highly recommended). Something to look forward to next time!"
18,1273,"Apr 29 2009 	great little hotel	The Stafford is a little gem tucked away In St. James' Place London. The hotel is old though it has been recently refurbished. The lobby and lounge are quite small though charming and the rooms are cozy, though it had LCD tv and high-speed internet. The restaurant/coffee shop served a nice breakfast and decent food. The staff are extremely friendly and were even went out of their way to help. The down side is that because it is so tucked away, even London cabbies are unfamiliar with it! (luckily they have GPS). The hotel is just behind Green Park and is a 2 minute walk from Green Park Station and a 10 minute walk from Piccadilly Circus."
19,1273,"Apr 21 2009 	Great location great service	Lovely traditional hotel, in a quiet but central location. Our room was very comfortable, though perhaps a bit on the small side, with a great bed and nice bathroom. Service is welcoming and very professional. Free internet and laptop use is a bonus. The hotel is expensive, but worth it if you can afford it. We definitely would return if planning to stay in the St. James/ Green Park area."
20,1273,"Dec 2 2008 	Style in St James'	An outstanding hotel in every respect. I had read on Trip Advisor how friendly the staff were and thought that some folk must be exaggerating a little bit. To my delight this accolade was right on the mark. I have never experienced such friendly, helpful and diligent hotel staff anywhere.Our room was very good, the bed in particular was an excellent size. It was by no means a top of the range room but could not be faulted.The bar was very good too and very well stocked -however, I must warn those on a tight budget, don't get too carried away as this is an expensive place to drink. That said, I had the best 'whiskey sour' I have ever had!Definitely a hotel I would recommend for anyone who wants homely comfort and style in the centre of London's West End."
21,1273,"Oct 24 2008	The only place I stay in London	When I travel to London, its the Stafford or nothing. simply the best in location, atmosphere and SERVICE."
22,1273,"Oct 22 2008 	Superb Stafford	I have never written a review before even though I have stayed at some top 5 star hotels in London (Covent Garden etc). However, I have just spent a weekend at the Stafford to celebrate my 40th birthday with my husband and I can honestly say it was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in. Our room (a suite in the mews) was beautiful and the service provided by all of the staff was exemplary on every level. When we arrived back at the hotel on the Saturday evening I commented to one of the concierge that my feet were aching and his reply was 'never mind you're home now' and that is exactly how the hotel feels-like your very own exclusive home in London. We are already planning our next trip and can't imagine going to any other hotel in London."
23,1273,"Sep 26 2008 	So glad we chose The Stafford	First-ever trip to London this past summer. Originally had other hotels on my radar screen but TA forums led me to The Stafford, for which I am grateful.We (family of four; two college-aged sons) spent five days in a suite and a room in the main building and another five in a suite and a room in the Mews. The main building is more traditionally English; the Mews more modern and felt a bit more spacious. We enjoyed falling asleep to the sound of gentlefolk in the courtyard below sitting at the famed American Bar's outside tables. In the states we'll generally choose a Four Seasons, or a Westin or Hyatt depending upon what's available. I was initially wary of staying in a smaller, non-chain hotel but quickly came to appreciate the benefits of The Stafford. The custom is to leave room keys (yes, actual keys!) at the desk when going out, which means there is a fair amount of contact with staff. Everyone - porters, concierge, business office personnel - was unfailingly friendly, professional and helpful. Continental breakfast was included with our room cost. We expected a hard roll and coffee, but instead enjoyed beginning each day in the hotel's lovely dining room, where breakfast (French press coffee, generous baskets of bakery items, divine marmalade and much more) were served on tables with crisp white tablecloths by impeccably professional and unobtrusive wait staff. Loved the St. James location. We walked everywhere from the hotel - close to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Green and St. James parks, not too far from Covent Garden. We could walk to a number of restaurants (The Wolesley, Chor Bizarre Indian and Cecconis for Italian being among our favorites). Took a walk one evening over to The Dorchester and saw The Inter-Continental and Four Seasons -- after a quick overview we were so glad we'd made the choice to stay at The Stafford. While the common areas of these other hotels seemed lovely, they felt more &quot;generic&quot; and, at least the evening we were there, felt more Middle Eastern than British. They are clustered in an area with very busy streets and lots of traffic, and we were so happy to return to the Stafford with its oh-so-English window boxes spilling over with red geraniums, and tucked well away from even from the genteel sounds of St. James Street.The Stafford apparently has a tradition of attracting American visitors that I believe dates back to WWII when US military officers stationed in London were fond of The Stafford's (hence, &quot;American&quot;) Bar. Scores of model airplanes hang from the ceiling of the bar (jackets required for men, there, by the way) and lots of fascinating photographs line the walls. There are also a number of portraits of the Queen Mother around the hotel; we were told that she was an admirer of The Stafford's impressive wine cellar.The concierge staff was helpful and effective, especially Frank Laino, who is touted as &quot;the world's best concierge&quot;. He is clearly deserving of his title.The only negative of our stay was a misunderstanding in regard to our arrival. Since we came into Heathrow early in the morning, we arrived at the hotel around 9:30 and asked if our rooms were available for early check-in. They were, and we were grateful to be able to get settled. We thought this was a lovely courtesy and were thus surprised when we were charged for an extra night upon check-out. The issue was quickly and kindly resolved, but I do recommend that guests at this (or any) hotel clarify exactly what the terms of early check-in are. Other than that, I have struggled to come up with a negative, but alas, the only thing I can think of is that there were no cotton balls or q-tips in the bath. Bring your own, and stay at The Stafford. You will not be disappointed."
24,1273,"Aug 28 2008 	the best hotel	This is my favorite hotel in the world, (so far!). It actually feels like I'm staying at my own very posh house in London, full of my loyal and friendly staff, who are happy that I'm finally back. The only place that's more centrally located is Buckingham palace, which is basically next door. It's thoroughly English, down to the giant brass keys that they give you. Everything is perfect, but nothing is modern. i wish i could live at the Stafford."
25,1273,"Jul 13 2008 	A Superb Hotel	We stayed three nights at the Stafford hotel and could not have been more pleased. The service was outstanding, the food at all times of the day was delicious, and the accommodations were top notch. The hotel is located in a great neighborhood, within walking distance of Piccadilly Circus and a variety of shops and restaurants. The staff was helpful with all of our questions and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The price is expensive, especially when you take into account the exchange rate against the U.S. Dollar, but we highly recommend it."
26,1273,"Apr 22 2008 	Nice old-world hotel	The Stafford is a good, traditional hotel but it fails to really impress in the way it could if the property were polished up just a little bit. The hotel is in a beautiful old building with a great location in the middle of St James. It is very tranditional and very English. There was nothing wrong with my room but it was absolutely miniscule and I'm used to smallish European hotel rooms. There is no way two people could have shared this room comfortable. My only real gripe about it, however, has to do with cleanliness. First of all, nothing seemd terrible clean to me to start with. Then, I found crumbs from a previous guest all over the desk chair (orange ones, so no one had even checked it or they would have seen them). Then there were the pretzel pieces under the chair/table that weren't cleaned up even after pointing them out to housekeeping. Clearly, no one is paying attention to cleaning here - and these are 'deep cleaning' things but very basic ones. The room service menu also leaves a lot to be desired but that is the case with many hotels."
27,1273,"Mar 27 2008 	I'd like to keep the Stafford my secret it's that good	My family of 4 stayed at The Stafford 2 separate times on our trip and my son and I returned on the last leg of our Europe jaunt because we enjoyed it so much. Because we were staying in London for only 4 days, I found that an apartment wasn't an option. Most require a week stay at least. Booking two separate hotel rooms for my husband, me and our 2 adult sons was an expensive option, until I found The Stafford. They have family suites which are basically two suites connected via a common hallway. The outer door to the hallway can be closed and the two suite doors left open. The Stafford's family suite rate was less expensive than if I booked two separate suites at another comparable hotel, even though that was exactly what we were getting. Plus, let me just say that the suites were amazing! The rooms were spotless, quiet, sunny and fresh. Each had supreme appointments, right down to the heated marble floors in the bathrooms, full shower, separate tub, 2 sinks. The tub even came with its own 2 rubber duckies. Every detail was considered in making these suites homelike. They have thought of everything. Besides the fabulous ensuite baths, each suite also had a sitting area with a large plasma TV which my sons enjoyed, as well as a desk area and a separate ladies vanity area. It truly was spectacular for the price. In addition, the hotel had a quaint parlor room where you could take tea, dessert or drinks, as well as a bar and gourmet restaurant. We were welcomed at the hotel like old friends each time we returned. The location of the hotel was also good. Close to Picadilly Circus, the Picadilly and Green Park tube stops, Green Park, St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, along with plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.I've stayed at other luxury level hotels and this one beat them all hands down. I would recommend this hotel highly and look forward to hopefully returning sometime soon."
28,1273,"Feb 24 2008 	Exceeded Expectations	The last few trips to London, we've stayed in larger hotels, but our travel agent suggested the Stafford. The hotel is very well situated, right near Piccadilly Circus and St James Park , yet located on a quiet side street so that there was no noise once inside.The rooms had a feel of a well decorated London flat more than a hotel and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Service here is some of the best I've experienced. We will definitely stay here on our next visit, and would recommend the Stafford for couples or families w/ kids."
29,1273,"Sep 20 2007 	Excellent in every way	We spent one glorious week in London at the Stafford with our 3 yr old daughter in July. Not only did we have great weather, the wonderful staff at the Stafford really made us feel at home. The concierge at the Stafford is the definition of proactive. Before we arrived, I received an email with info about road closures because of the Tour de France-- very helpful since we were driving into London. I'd also bought tickets to a show that we didn't want. In addition to getting us prime tickets for the Sound of Music, the concierge also offered to sell our original tickets (no takers). And they hustled to get a last minute babysitter for us during an especially busy weekend in London. So it goes without saying that they can get any restaurant reservation in town-- including the Ivy!Our 1 bdrm suite in the Mews was done in shades of blue and chocolate, and felt like a chicly decorated apartment rather than a hotel room. We had a foyer with ample room to park the stroller and a powder room. The living room had a mini fridge, an Ipod docking station, and a desk with Wifi access. I even had personalized namecards! Our bed was very comfortable, and we had plenty of closet space and hangers. We didn't eat in the formal restaurant, but had drinks and dessert in the American bar (cozy but my husband had to wear a jacket). Food from room service, esp the fish and chips, was excellent. We did encounter some minor snafus with room service and a surly waiter, but management was very responsive and cleared things up quickly. The location is ideal-- the Stafford may be secreted down a small alley, but it's just steps away from the commercial hustle and bustle. It's an easy walk to Old Bond Street, Piccadilly, Green Park, the Tube, etc. Great restaurants are also nearby (we loved the steak tartare and people-watching at the Wolseley) We loved The Stafford and definitely plan to return."
30,1273,"Sep 18 2007 	Lovely hotel	I stayed just one night on a whirlwind work trip, but have to agree with the positive reviews. The staff were very helpful, the room service for breakfast both days was super-fast, the location is amazing - you can run right out the front door into Green Park and then Hyde Park. I also had dinner (the fish and chips!) in the American Bar, and it was yum. I had the basic room and it was quite tiny (as I said, a work trip!), but still very nice with a Bose stereo, small plasma tv etc. I also took a pass down to the gym at Piccadilly to do a spin class, and that worked well. While we all know that phone calls from a hotel room are expensive, I was blown away at the cost of my call to home - 15 minutes was 68 pounds, being over $150 Australian dollars! So be warned on that one."
31,1273,"Jul 26 2007 	Lovely Hotel Amazing Location	We stayed at The Stafford from 6/30-7/7/07 with our two children, ages 5 and 9, in a double deluxe room (for the grownups) interconnecting with a double room (for the children) in the Mews. Overall, we were extremely pleased. Our (interconnected) rooms felt more like a small, luxurious apartment than a &quot;hotel&quot; room -- we loved the amenities, such as a half bathroom in our foyer, large closets, &quot;warm&quot; marble bathroom floors, flat screen tvs, DVD players, IPOD docking stations, etc. The deluxe double has a lovely sitting area with its own flat screen tv. And while there weren't any special &quot;children's amenities,&quot; the staff thrilled our kids by bringing them an IPOD for their docking station and provided us with bread to feed the ducks in St. James Park. My husband regularly used the new fitness center in the Mews and was quite pleased with it (he did not feel the need to use the deluxe health club located near Piccadilly that the hotel offers to guests). The location is outstanding. The Green Park Tube is steps away. It's an easy walk to Piccadilly, St. James Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, etc. Our kids were excited to see the guards outside St. James Palace, and witnessed a &quot;small&quot; Changing the Guard there in addition to the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. There are excellent restaurants and shopping within walking distance. The concierges are pleasant, responsive and professional, as is the front dest staff. My only &quot;nit&quot; was that housekeeping was inconsistent -- i.e, the rooms were spotless, but some days they would neglect to replace the soaps, shampoos, etc. or empty the wastebaskets. We loved The Stafford. We have recommended it to our friends, and we would definately stay there again."
32,1273,"Jul 24 2007 	Luxury is Back	This was the first time I have stayed at The Stafford since its recent renovation. What a difference. We had one of the new Mews apartments and the standard of luxury was very impressive - his and hers basins, huge bath and equally vast separate shower, underfloor heating, full-size Floris toiletries, two plasma TVs and an iPod . The breakfast was very good and I liked the fact that if you just wanted a continental breakfast - not a cooked one - it was available at a cheaper cost because the hotel is a la carte. The location is wonderful - a short walk to all of London's great sights. Most of the staff were very welcoming and pleasant - especially in the breakfast room - but the front desk staff are all Cockneys and their manner is somewhat brusque and, as is their way, offhand. That's fine if you think that's picturesque but I preferred the French, Spanish, South African and New Zealand staff members who were unfailingly polite and smiling. The concierge, Frank Laino, however deserves all his accolades - very polite and helpful. Would definitely come back to this rejuvenated gem."
33,1273,"Jun 1 2007 	Very Comfortable	I stayed two nights at the Stafford on May 8 &amp; 9, 2007. This was my first stay although I had visited the hotel and looked at a sampling of rooms in 2006. The first night I stayed in a deluxe junior suite in the main building and the second night in a deluxe junior suite in the new mews building that had only been open one week. Both rooms were large, comfortable and quiet. I preferred the mews suite because of its nicer bath and newness.My main building room was in the rear and was extremely quiet. It had a separate sitting room with a good reading lamp. The bath was fairly small, but had a separate shower. The room was furnished traditionally with king bed, chair and sofa. Actually, both rooms had two twin beds pushed together to form a king which I found satisfactory.My mews room was on the rear of that building overlooking the Park Place cul-de-sac. It had one large room with a sitting area at one end with only a loveseat--no upholstered chair. The TV was flat panel, wide-screen, whereas the main building room had an older conventional TV. There was some street noise, but it was muffled and acceptable to me. The bath was huge with two sinks, a separate shower and heated tile floor.The Stafford is excellently located a short walk through the park from the Green Park tube station. There are many nearby restaurants on and near Piccadilly. It is walking distance to many attractions, including the theater district. The general neighborhood in nice and upscale. A laptop is on a table in the lobby for free guest use and was almost always available when I wanted to use it.Breakfasts were very good--from the menu--no buffet--in the attractive restaurant. I had dinner one night in the New American Bar and enjoyed it. I didn't eat dinner in the more upscale restaurant.Overall, I found the Stafford to be a very pleasant place to stay and will stay there again. I would classify it as a 5-star hotel."
34,1273,"Apr 18 2007 	Incredible Hotel	Just got back from London and loved the Stafford Hotel. Rate was reasonable (for London) and included dinner 1 night at their restaurant (excellent) and breakfast everyday. They had a room for usfirst ting in the morning eventhough check-in was not until the afternoon. Service was incredible. They were very helpful and knew who we were after the first day. Every dinner suggestion was wonderful.I loved the location (St. James) I had stayed near Holborn my previous trips, and this was far more convenient for tourist spots, fine dining and the theater.While there was construction going on in the Mews, we could not notice it from our room. The only problem (and a minor one at that) was a small shower. However, this minor inconvenience was overwhelmedby the other hotel amenities. My favorites were the free bottles of water (two, replaced every day at no cost, free internet access downstairs, and two 110 volt outlets). I would definitely stay there again."
35,1273,"Dec 4 2006	The Stafford is Not a Luxury Hotel	The Stafford is undergoing major reconstruction at the moment. I stayed in the carriage house section of the property, which is supposed to be the finest room that the hotel has to offer. It was not that nice (small, smell of mildew, lumpy carpets, not enough hot water for two people to shower consecutively). Even without the construction problem, I would not consider this a true luxury hotel. The best thing that can be said about the hotel is that the staff are friendly, but the property itself is below-par. I would not stay at this hotel again."
36,1273,"Apr 28 2006 	The Best Hotel in London	My family has been staying here for over 15 years. To me, it is the best hotel in London. The location is great (with its own private access to Green Park), the staff all that you could ask for (they take time to know everyone's name and what their preferences are), the rooms are wonderful (I prefer the Carriage House annex to the main buliding).Some may decry the lack of amenities (there is no gym, pool, etc), but that's fine with me. This is a hotel with charm and class.Is it expensive? Absolutely!!! Is it worth it? Yes (especially if you do not have to pay)"
37,1273,"Apr 18 2006	Country house elegance	My first stay at this wonderful hotel, an all too brief stay of 2 nights (if only it could have been longer !). An excellent central location in a lovely secluded street near St James Palace, and near to my library, and to excellent shopping.This hotel is so quaint with staff who go the extra mile to provide that rare commodity known as &quot;service&quot;. A great restaurant, nice lounge, and a wonderful bar at the back of the hotel. I didn't quite meet the evening dress code for the bar but the barman told me in the most delightful manner possible; he did not make feel awkward (as some hotel bars might have done) and I was pleased to correct the situation in just a few moments.Good &quot;front-of-house&quot; staff who are welcoming without exception, and knowledgeable about London.My room was a tad small but nicely decorated. Bed was a little soft for my liking.I will definitely return when I need to stay in Central London."
38,1273,"Jan 25 2006	Excellent Hotel	Great hotel in a fabulous location. Can see why is it rated as one of the best in London. We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready. We were given another room in the mean time to rest in whilst we waited for our room to be prepared. The staff were excellent. Very quiet area and close to Green Park Underground Station, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, Trafalga Square. The room was average size and the facilities were nice."
39,1273,"Jan 15 2006 	Charming hotel great service	Very charming.At least, I guest that's what they will call it. Decor is a bit dated, no flatscreen televisions, the grouting in the bathroom just three days past the point where it should have been re-done etc. Not the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed in, just make this hotel a little dated. Nothing that can't be fixed with a little investment.The basics are certainly there though. The location (although that always depends on your needs and as long as you're in the centre of london...) The staff is wonderfull in it's service. friendly and attentative. They do remember you and have the prescence of mind to pickup the conversation where you left it the last time yo've spoken to them. And the (I believe belgian?) girl beind the reception just makes your day. Food is great, and it is certainly nice to see this hotel is being noticed by some people you might not walk into on the street.Despite the little imperfections, I will definetely stay there again. I believe this is called charming."
40,1273,"Jul 19 2005 	Traditional luxury in a stellar location	The Stafford Hotel occupies a prime London location. Only a short walk to St. James's Palace and Green Park, this hotel is situated in arguably the top neighborhood in the city. But the Stafford doesn't sacrifice peace and quiet for its central location. The hotel is tucked into the warren of historic side streets and courtyards of St. James's, making it almost unbelievable that busy Piccadilly is just a block or so north. The front of the hotel is on a short dead-end street; the rear of the hotel is essentially a courtyard (Blue Ball Court).In the midst of genteel clubs and upper-crust establishments of St. James's, the Stafford is a traditional and historic older hotel, furnished and maintained to a high standard. With only 81 rooms, the Stafford focuses on an individualized service for its guests.Standard rooms are moderately-sized--a bit small by U.S. standards, but generous for London hotels. Ours included a small entryway with a countertop/cabinet housing a safe and a mini refrigerator. The fridge was ours to use with (thankfully) no minibar in sight. A bottle of house wine, fruit, and bottled water was included at the start of our visit.The room was well furnished and included a firm king-size bed. Typical for British hotels, the &quot;king&quot; consisted of joined smaller mattresses, but with almost no discernable gap or bump...very comfortable. Heavy curtains and double windows insulated us against any street noise--and there was almost none due to the hotel's location. The individually controlled central airconditioning/heating system was excellent and blessedly quiet. A marble bathroom included a large tub, vanity, and separate phone booth-sized shower stall. Water pressure was adequate--perhaps a bit too adequate in the shower. Towels were large and plentiful, and washcloths were provided. The hotel furnished soap and shampoo, but surprisingly, no other amenities other than shower caps (and who uses them anymore?).The room's television featured a limited selection of channels, with no movies or other entertainment options. This is a relatively minor issue for those visiting one of the most interesting cities in the world, but even the most ambitious tourist needs time to &quot;zone out&quot; watching TV at times. They won't find much to watch on the Stafford's limited video system. These comments apply to the standard double room; the hotel's carriage house rooms and suites offer a different experience for a price premium. London hotel accommodations are not known for many bargains and the Stafford's location and quality do come with a sizeable pricetag.The Stafford is a historic building, actually a series of converted buildings, including three former townhouses and a stable/mews. As an older building, even one furnished and maintained to a luxury standard, noise from creaky floors was a minor annoyance in our main building room. Surprisingly, plumbing noise was less noticeable. No doubt there are exceptions, but the clientele of the hotel seems to be a quiet, sophisticated group of travelers. This lends to the ambiance of the hotel and means few worries about one of our hotel pet peeves--the obnoxious and noisy fellow guest.The atmosphere at the Stafford is further enhanced by a dedication to providing excellent, efficient service. We experienced a high level of service from the front desk, office/cashier, and bar staff. The concierge staff were the most helpful we've seen anywhere. As a smaller hotel, the Stafford does not offer all the onsite facilities that a large, 5-star property might. But they do very well. Need business services, like a computer or a mobile phone? No problem, the hotel will loan guests a laptop computer and arrange for use of a phone. The hotel features a naturally upscale dining room, lounge, and a famous bar. The diminutive American Bar is like a private pub...a very nice private pub, filled with an amazing collection of memorabilia. The small bar can be smoky, like most bars and pubs in London, although odds are as good that no smokers will be present, given the small size of the bar.Guests should ask to tour the Stafford's vaulted brick wine cellars. Private diners are held here (which must be fantastic), but even a quick tour is fascinating. The cellars include a collection of memorabilia from the Second World War, when the hotel was used as a billet for Allied Officers, and the cellars doubled as bomb shelters."
41,1273,"Jul 13 2005	Not what I expected	After reading various internet reviews and an Andrew Harper's review, I decided on the Stafford in London. Unfortunately, it was not at all what I had expected. Instead of cozy English charm, I found tired, dreary rooms with tiny bathrooms. The service (which had been spoken of highly in several reviews) was mediocre at best. They were not in the least bit friendly or accomadating other than one concierge that we had some contact with, Peter.I feel that I saw a fairly good sampling of the rooms since we had 2 junior suites and a double room. None of these rooms fell even close to the quality of what is described in the literature as a five-star hotel. The prices for the accomadations ($950 per night for the suites and about $650 per night for the room) was absurd given their suboptimal quality. After two nights, we moved to a much, much nicer property ( The Athaneum Hotel and Apartments). I strongly recommend the Athaneum. I would not stay at the Stafford again in those particular rooms although they may have rooms that are larger, better kept and more attractively decorated. I did not see any of those.The only positive aspect that our family saw about the Stafford was its excellent location in St. James close to many sites and the upscale shopping that we had specifically come for on Bond Street, Jermyn Street etc. Otherwise, what a dissapointment the Stafford was!"
42,1273,"Jun 19 2005	Stafford excellent in every way!	One of the nicest hotels I have stayed at, anywhere. Rented 2 adjoining rooms for my wife/I and our 2 college-aged daughters. Great location, helpful staff, and absolutely quiet rooms. We travel quite a lot, and found this hotel to be 'top rate' in every aspect."
43,1273,"Jun 7 2005	A really good hotel	I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend and loved it. As a young couple it can be quite intimidating staying somewhere like this but the staff are great, very friendly and professional, a good combination.Our room was very comfortable, and the american bar is worth the stay alone. Really bizarre collection of baseball caps, signed photos and more which give it real atmosphere. And as has already been mentioned, excellent service again.As for the complaint re the noise in an earlier review I find that extremely harsh. This hotel is tucked away off any main streets and the noise is limited. If you're going to stay in the centre of London then surely you expect there is going to be some sort of noise!My only minor quibble was that when we called down for a sandwich and a drink at 2.30am the night porter asked us if we realised that it was 2.30am which seemed slightly cheeky since the room service menu clearly states it's available 24 hours. Anyway...Lovely hotel, great location."
44,1273,"Mar 21 2005	Loved the Stafford!!!	The Stafford is simply the most gorgeous hotel I've ever stayed at. I cannot express enough how charming and special the place is. I regularly pop in for traditional afternoon tea on a Sunday. I also love having dinner in the American Bar - fantastic burgers and club sandwiches, all served by a barman who remembers your name.Best of all is actually staying at the Stafford. The staff are like family. Nothing is too much trouble. Forget going to the Ritz or one of the big touristy hotels in London. The Stafford has far more class and is thus filled with people who really know the difference between &quot;flashy&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot;."
45,1273,"Dec 22 2004	Great Location very quiet	We stayed at the Stafford Dec.3, 2004 for 3 nights. It was our first visit to London and we really didn't have much time there. I found the Stafford to be a very nice hotel, very quiet and in an excellent location. The Green Park tube station is just a couple of minutes away. Our room was smaller than I'd anticipated, but I'm used to American standards, so actually in European standards it was spacious. We had a sitting area and it had a small fold-out sofa. The bathroom was gorgeous, all done in marble and with heated towel racks. We had a mini-bar in our room, a safe and bathrobes. The staff was very, very helpful and friendly. My only complaint was the cost; wow, everything was so expensive! I'd come back here again if I can afford it."
46,1273,"Aug 1 2004	ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PROPERTY!!	My sister and I stayed at The Stafford in March, 2004 and as a former flight attendant and one who continues to travel frequently, this hotel has to rate as the very best. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. I cannot say one negative comment. I would never stay anywhere else when again in London. And the location is perfect. Kudos to the general manager and his entire staff."
47,1273,"Dec 1 2003	nice place to spend Thanksgiving	Yes,the rooms are small but they are cozy and charming. The food at the restaurant is excellent and afternoon tea is worth the price. But why no mini bars in the rooms? As a woman travelling alone,I felt safe and secure here. And you can't beat the proximity to the Green Park tube station."
48,1273,"Nov 27 2003	christmas at the stafford magical	My wife and two daughters spent a magical christmas here. Mulled wine and carolers in the famous cave wine celler. Formal Christmas Eve dinner with attentive, friendly service and always the funloving manager Terry Holmes making what could be a stuffy atmosphere a delightful and somewhat zaney but memorable experience. Christmas day brunch is a must as well."
49,1273,"Oct 26 2003	Okay...	Well..it was okay. The lobbies (and first couple of floors) were really smokey. The rooms were alot smaller than shown on the website. The streets are very busy, and you don't get much sleep, unless you learn to ignore the continuous honking, and sirens. Creaky floors.However, the bathrooms were very nice, and you get a nice, big, buffet-style breakfast. People there were pretty friendly."
50,1273,Aug 9 2003	Nice but not for me	Based on lots of good press I stayed here at the end of 2002 and even chose a room in the 'famous' Carriage House. I had one downstairs and would recommend to try to get one upstairs if you go so you can benefit from the higher ceilings vs. the llower floor. The hotel is indeed very British if that is what you want. I found it a little stuffy and prefer less traditional hotels myself.Maybe I caught the hotel during a bad time since I had to wait a long time for porters and front desk service. In the bar I was reminded that I should really be dressed formal and only served because there were not a lot of other guests.The location is very good and there is nothing wrong with the Stafford but I would not come back since there are many better choices for my taste.
51,1273,"Jul 20 2003	Superb.	The most delightful hotel I have ever visited. The level of courtesy and service immediately made you feel at home.The staff in the bar were especially charming. If you ever ventured in by yourself they would engage you in conversation to put you at your ease. They of course would also remember what you had been drinking on the previous evening. It was great fun to watch them gently flirting with the permanent resident as she sat at the bar on her own stool and told stories of her time in the French resistance.The porters also deserve commendation, they recommended a delightful restaurant for us and I never once had to open a door (something that can be quite rare in British hotels). They also were concerned that we shouldn't be lumbered with having to pay too much for parking and found us a spot where we could leave our car. Most kind.Our marble bathroom was well stocked with luxurious Floris toiletries (of which I am now a fan) and it was a pleasure to relax in the very deep bath whilst listening to the selection of CDs left for us to play on the Bose music centre.To conclude....Don't Go!! I want it all to myself."
52,1273,"Jun 9 2003	The Best of London	Have been staying at the Stafford for 14 years and will not stay anywhere else in London. I go to London 2-3 times a year on business and always stay there. It represents the quintessential London luxury hotel, on a very small and intimate scale, but never takes itself too seriously. Staff is constant, with very little turnover. The first bartender, Charles, stayed for over 40 years, and likely would have stayed longer had he not been prematurely taken from us a few years ago. And the Manager, Terry Holmes, has become a London institution. This is the kind of place where the barman remembers your favorite drink (and your name) without being reminded and regardless of how long it has been since your last visit. The sommalier in the restaurant can recall the bottle of wine you drank on your previous stay and will check to see if it is still available. The Chef will prepare anything you request if he has the ingredients in the kitchen, and if he does not, he will go find them if you give him a little advance notice. The Consierge (they call them Hall Porters, in the old English tradition) can always be counted on to get those hard to find theater tickets or restaurant reservations on short notice, or to provide a guided tour of the 350-year old Wine Cellar at 2:00 a.m. after returning from a long night out (I actually did this). Guests tend to be very loyal to the Hotel, chosing to stay there year after year. And there are examples of third generation guests whose grandparents and parents also stayed at the Stafford."

3,1278,"Aug 3 2009 	STAY AWAY FROM THIS ""HOTEL""	First and foremost"
4,1278,Jul 28 2009 	This place should be shut down.	Needed an overnight stay in London before our departure back to the U.S. Wish I had researched better. Filthy place with narrow hallways and dangerous stairs..room was disgusting. Stained walls and smelled of mildew . Bathroom was just as disgusting with no working lights. We slept on top of the covers fully clothed
5,1278,Apr 27 2009 	Not coming back...ever!!!	My cousin recommended this and he was totally disappointed as well. When we checked in
6,1278,Mar 1 2009 	Filthy!	This hotel is undoubtedly the most unclean place I have ever stayed in.The room was tiny
7,1278,Feb 7 2009 	Absolutley filthy stay well away	Stayed here for two nights this moth
8,1278,Feb 5 2009 	Stay Away from this Hotel!!!	Oh my God!!!! Me and my boyfrend thought living a NIGHTMARE!!! Please STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL for YOUR HEALTH!!! I try explain my experience: little hall quite dirty; receptionist were ungry and not kind; our room at 4th floor (without lift) and accessible from a series of narrow and dangerous stairs; a very very very little bedroom really filthy (not to talk about WC!!!); carpet everywhere just like green for parasitics!!! Hope you'll never visit this hotel!!! The only positive thing is the location but... not so positive to choose this hotel... hotel?!?!?!?!? PIGSTY!!!	
9,1278,Jan 23 2009 	Dreadful	The bedroom walls were filthy with some dubious stains on them. The furniture was poor and falling apart. The &quot;en-suite&quot; was basically a tiled cupboard and was dirty.The breakfast was ok though.	
10,1278,Dec 9 2008 	Low cost staying	We spent a long weekend in London &amp; did fix my choice on this hotel bacuse it was said to be cheap. Actually
11,1278,Nov 16 2008 	Children Nightmare	Heavily infested beds with BED BUGS
12,1278,Nov 14 2008	Awful!	If I had not been wandering in London trying to find somewhere to spend the night before a flight on the following day
13,1278,Oct 13 2008	Don't Bother!	Alarm bells started to ring when I was checking in &amp; two separate groups of people complained to reception about the quality and cleanliness of the rooms. The people at reception showed no signs of regret or apology for this and said that it was not their fault that the customers had chosen to stay with them and that they could either stay or lose money if they went elsewhere. The rooms were terrible
14,1278,Oct 13 2008 	Terrible!	WORST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED IN!Do not believe any good reviews of this place
15,1278,Sep 30 2008 	DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!	After recently staying at the hotel on Saturday Evening we were left feeling very disappointed. When we returned home we did look on the internet at other hotels we could of stayed in and they are of a much higher standard at the same or lower cost and we have come to the conclusion that we have been cheated!! After walking in to the hotel we were greeted by very friendly reception staff which gave us a good impression of the hotel we were gave the room key 205 after walking in to the hotel room this is when the disappointment began the hotel room was very small with a double bed in the room -  Point 1 - The lock on the window was broken which left us feeling that our belongings were very unsafePoint 2 - There was no Hot water even though the switch had been turned on all day we then had to wait a further 20 minutes before we could get readyPoint 3 - The bathroom and bedroom walls were extremely grubby Point 4 - The mattress on the bed had about had it with regards to comfort.Point 5 - We were kept awake all night by people walking around above us and running water ALL NIGHT!! With all these points combined you can understand why we didn't even want to try breakfast and get out of there as soon as possible. As a Travel Agent selling London Breaks we visit the hotels to see which ones we can promote and sell to our customers however the hotels need to be up to a certain standard to even open!!  We payed upfront at this hotel and we would like our money back half if not a full refund as this is absolutely not acceptable!!	
16,1278,Sep 10 2008 	ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE	We were sent to the Ventures by another hotel we were booked with as some of their rooms had maintenance problems. I was horrified. My room was disgusting. The stains on every wall were awful
17,1278,Nov 25 2007	The most terrible hotel ever!!!	People
18,1278,Mar 5 2009 	Avis plus que défavorable		
1,1282,"Nov 25 2009 	Loved it	I loved this hotel. We stayed in a corner delux room which was fab. There are great cocktails in the bar and the breakfast is very good (although a little expensive). I liked the free coffee from the machine in the corridor and the late night access to the vending machine selling wine and beer etc. We would normally stay at The Hoxton when we stay in London overnight, but this place is really so much nicer we will be staying here from now on. Finally the staff are absolutely brilliant."
2,1282,"Nov 14 2009 	Needs Work	I'm not someone that requires luxury, but I was disappointed by most aspects of The Zetter. The TV was small and wall/ceiling mounted, so it was hard to see, the furniture was base plywood, the chair was dated-modern with a few screws missing, and the shower lacked pressure. The back courtyard was noisy, and the windows were not new, so both the noise and cold air crept through. The staff was polite, but not warm. The neighborhood is OK, but not great, and the location is not the best for taxis (though the desk will call for you). People have told me that he restaurant is above average hotel fare. Bottom Line: Not a bad hotel, but could use some work."
3,1282,"Oct 8 2009 	Great value	The Zetter is a great value. If you want to be in the &quot;hip and trendy&quot; Clerkenwell area, this hotel is a good deal. Rooms are clean, chic and not as tiny as most big city hotels. The staff tried hard to be accommodating. The hotel is not particularly luxurious, but I can recommend it for those looking for value in London."
4,1282,"Sep 29 2009 	Head Down to the Zetter!	If you want to be away from the maddening crowds, then head here!!We went for the weekend - Fri to Monday, and stayed in Room 503 (best in the house!) which had a massive roof terrace, which is great for a bit of sun bathing when you come in from sight seeing! The staff are great, especially with my million questions - you are away from the hustle of the tourist areas, which for us was great, and you are literally 10 mins away from everything on the bus, tube or taxi.We had breakfast at the hotel on the Sat, which was delicious, and then went round the corner on the Sunday to Smiths of Smithfields for their Sunday breakfast - you get the best of all worlds then.Downsides - room was a bit hot, and the bathroom had the mirror that is always hot to stop it from steaming up, which is great, but the bathrooms a bit tiny, so ends up like a sauna! For the money paid, if we hadn't done the 3 nights for 2, I would have been a bit disappointed with the toiletries....sounds a bit spoilt, but I would like to know that I'm getting spoilt for my money...nice toiletries do make that difference. I am that shallow...!The area is fairly quiet during the day at the weekends, which for us, we enjoyed  its not manic as soon as you head out of the door. Its a less touristy area, and more residential. If youre after something a bit more personal, which is quite funky, then this is your place."
5,1282,"Sep 24 2009 	this place is perfect!	Perfect location, very small but beautiful rooms (standard in London), BIG bathroom and immaculate. Clerkenwell is a VERY COOL foodie area that is super close (5 mins by tube or bus) to central London attractions. I will always stay here when I come to London."
6,1282,"Sep 8 2009 	Posh without the Dosh!	This was one of my favorite hotels, the service was great, the staff was excellent and the rooms were fantastic. We were there for a family wedding and everyone loved it, not so perfect for those looking to do some sight seeing but if your just wanting a london get away its perfect!"
7,1282,"Sep 5 2009 	Quality in an urban chic decor	We've Stayed at the Zetter for a couple of night this summer and really enjoyed our stay. The customer service we got was second to none, very warm welcome but yet quite a relax atmosphere. We only tried the full English breakfast from the restaurant. Verdict: delicious and very good value."
8,1282,"Sep 3 2009 	We Loved Our Stay	We had an extended family stay at the Zetter over the wedding weekend of my daughter. There were a lot of us with a lot of needs! And the staff at the Zetter went way beyond the call for everyone and everything. They accomodated romance and strops and room service with grace. Thanks, we recomend you and commend you!"
9,1282,"Aug 31 2009	Trendy but hospitable and efficient	The Zetter (at a bargain rate) was a mixture of treat for getting a new job and getting away from noisy neighbours on a boring Bank Holiday weekend. Despite knowing the area (and indeed the bar/restaurant) from experience I had some apprehensions about staying. Would it be snooty/up itself, not really clean enough, ditzy, you get the picture.In fact it was none of the above - super comfy bed, quiet (corner rooms are worth going for btw) and friendly, on the ball staff.The entertainment system (TV wasn't the greatest but worked ) does allow for barricading yourself in - judging by my neighbours at least 4 rooms on my floor were Do Not Disturb but you couldn't hear a peep. Music is free and films are 5 a view. Plus you can bring your own.There is noise in the corridor from the bar below but you can't hear it in the room with the door shut. There is also some footfall noise from room above but none from same floor neighbours. Walk in 'rain' shower in small, clean bathroom. Magazines and great choice of 24 hr room service.My only (v minor) gripes were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room - you have to go and get free coffees/teas from a machine in the hall although this does mean you get OK coffee for a change. No minibar either although the automated bar prices - also in the hall - didn't cost the usual body parts. The decor and approach is quirky (V Clerkenwell) and will need, ahem, updating sooner rather than later if it is to stay cutting edge, but all in all a boutique hotel that actually delivers."
10,1282,"Aug 17 2009 	AbZolutly Perfect!	We visited london for my birthday weekend which I had no idea i was recieveing! - I was worried as my husband had chosen and booked everything (and it is me that usualy does the planning) I didnt know about the trip until we arrived on a train from sheffield! and i can officialy say i was wrong to doubt him - after staying in numerous chic hotels around the world this is by far one of the best! interior design is beautiful and quirky. The staff go out of their way to help you and always have time for a quick friendly chat. The room was small but perfectly formed with delicious toiletries and robes on hand after a day of seeing all the london sights! The hotel restuarant was lovely the staff amazing and the food out of this world - especialy the desserts! As we retired to our room somewhat tipsy - we discovered the lovely second hand books - although we didnt read for long as we fell into a deep slumber - As we awoke we found lovely little touches like a newspaper left outside the door complete with a leaflet of all the bit and bobs and flea markets going off localy and made ourself hot drinks from our own machine outside the room! To sum it up - The vending machines - The coffee machine (free) the newspaper, the books the lovely design the super friendly staff and the location really made my birthday weekend one of the best ever! Tip - Jamie Olivers 15 resturant is on the bus route right outside the hotel and is only 3 stops along - The food was lovely but not as nice as the hotel! I really recommend staying here!"
11,1282,"Aug 17 2009 	Environmentally-conscious Fun Friendly Comfortable with touches of Luxury!	What a fantastic experience. A red-eye flight had left my man and I exhausted. We arrived a good 4 hours before check-in time, and were told to wait five little minutes for our room which would be ready in no time. This really scored points. The room was large-ish, clean as a whistle, and stylish. Aveda products were found in the modern shower. Nice. We sunk into the extremely comfortable bed, surrounded by a very soothing light. Quiet and calm in the center of bustling London! The location couldn't have been better. After a well-deserved nap, we explored the neighbourhood. We loved being in a less tourist-centric area, where gastropubs and stylish wine bars were filled with locals in-the-know. It was a perfect center for going just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Late night, this hotel was great for cocktails, room service (24h) and fantastic concierge services. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, more knowledgeable and professional. The mini-bar on each floor offered a selection of Champagne, Wine, and Cocktails. Every morning, a free copy of The Guardian graced our doorstep. Free wi-fi everywhere. This hotel also uses all kinds of natural energy sources, which makes it all the more appealing! An A+ experience. Highly recommended."
12,1282,Aug 10 2009 	wonderful zzzzzzzz	A lovely relaxed sunday night stay in an interesting area of the city. Professional friendly staff great rooms the most comfortable hotel bed and amazing walk in shower.I have to stay in london occasionally with work and i am going to INSIST on staying here Ohhhh and i love the online music library
13,1282,Aug 1 2009 	cosy and efficient	sometimes we have to visit London for overnight stay in this area and find this hotel quirky and fun + very efficiently run and thoroughly modern in its approach. The food and service is very very good and I would recommend the hotel. We like the decor and style - very modern but comfortable with all little comforts catered for!
14,1282,"Jul 30 2009 	Great hotel	I had the pleasure of staying here twice while on business in Europe. The second time I checked in the manager left a note in my room welcoming me back. It's nice that they appreciate repeat business.The rooms are small, but it is London. The location isn't the best, but it was perfect as it was walking distance to my office."
15,1282,"Jul 22 2009 	Amazing Staff Great Room Perfect Location	We stayed here as we couldn't get into Malmaison and we really wanted to be in the Clerkenwell area.When we arrived at midday we were able to check straight in. The staff were so professional, charming and helpful.We booked a compact / bijou / smaller room (sorry I can't remember the correct name for it!) however the room was so well designed and had a high ceiling with large windows that it really didn't feel small at all.The decor was stylish with coloured lighting, robes, great toiletires and little touches such as bottled water and books.There was a selection of things to buy in the room (snacks etc) and 24 hour room service which we used and the sandwiches were delicious. The in-room info was really interesting too, detailing information about the design and ethos of the hotel.The hotel is just over 5 minutes walk from Farringdon tube and is really easy to spot.I would defiinately stay here again and hopefully next time try their restaurant and bar. Overall a fab hotel :-)"
16,1282,"Jul 17 2009 	Absolutely spot on- would highly recommend	I have stayed at The Zetter on a number of occasions and can't fault it. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped, the staff are friendly and very helpful, the decor is great and the showers.... sooo good!I would stay here everytime!! I didn't use the restaurant this time but have eaten there before... it is very good - totally unlike a hotel restaurant and there is a lovely area that you can sit outside in a pedestrianised square when it is nice.It is walking distance to the West End/ Soho/ Oxford St (not in heels though!) and about a four minute walk to Farringdon tube station - which is a link for both overground and underground trains."
17,1282,"Jul 6 2009 	decent location nice rooms great service	Well firstly, if you're an American visitor, you might just find the rooms a tad a on the small side - this is prime City London real estate, and understandably the design squeezes out every square inch of space; the quid pro quo is that whilst it's not cheap, generally it's reasonable value for a central London hotel. I've certainly suffered a lot worse for more.Check in was friendly and efficient - I was offered a choice of rooms and elected for one towards the back of the hotel away from Clerkenwell Rd which given the location is always going to be a tad noisy.The room decor is simple but modern; there are nice touches like the marble sink and walk in shower you tend to get top end 5* hotels; outside our room was a real expresso machine, and best of all, fresh milk in a flask.I didn't use the restaurant or bar - frankly there are just too many choices 5 minutes from the front door! but again the decor was modern, stylish and clean.My only problem was that I found the air conditioning was not working on what I imagine was London's hottest night for several years, and it was pretty unbearable in the room overnight. However, it was sorted out quickly and I was graciously offered a discount on the room. Things do go wrong with customer service - that's a fact of life - and the mark of a good experience is one where you are content with the outcome. The Zetter came up trumps on this score.Overall a good place, and given the quality of some places in the city, I don't think you could go too far wrong."
18,1282,"Jun 25 2009 	Excellent Service and Style	I have stayed at The Zetter twice in the last month on business. I had been staying regularly at Malmaison but I had had enough of the poor service and the annoying 'Mal speak' of all of their generic menus etc. The Zetter was a breath of fresh air with friendly, attentive staff and an individual style and personality. The rooms and restaurant are bright and airy (which was a pleasant change from the dark gloom of Malmaison) and the breakfast is excellent. I have now insisted that The Zetter be added to our company list of recommended hotels and will certainly be returning frequently in the future."
19,1282,"Jun 23 2009 	The best hotel for me	I went to London to spend my husband's 35th Birtdhay... it was my present to him and just what I was looking for!The food is great, the service very laid down and friendly and the area is really chic and bohemian, and is not in the middle of the normal turist crowd, thanks for that!The rooms are small but cozy and clean and very nicely decorated... they have tons of movies, music and books and we stayed in a suite with a balcony! which was GREAT value for money and proved to be a VERY romantic night!I will go back any time!"
20,1282,"Jun 22 2009 	The Chic Hotel in Clerkenwell	We chose The Zetter for a wedding reception last year and am glad we did, as everything went perfectly which truly made it a memorable day. The staff are very friendly and accomodating, the rooms stylish and elegant, a wonderful Mediterannean restaurant and at very affordable prices.Located in the heart of Clerkenwell, it is conveniently located for sight-seeing, shopping, many restauarnts and bars which has lots to offer for everyone.I would certainly recommend The Zetter and we are looking forward to the First Wedding Anniversary as we are booked in there again."
21,1282,"Jun 22 2009 	Hip 'n' happening hotel in East London. I can't literally can't fault it...	My fiance and I decided to treat ourselves with a night in a London hotel and choose the Zetter. The Zetter breaks with the usual formula for boutique hotels and I loved the colour schemes, funky touches (like the vending machines which dispense champagne) and general ambience of this hotel. The breakfast was well above par - I had the bagel with bacon and avocado which was yum  and the service was friendly and faultless. Yes, it's not in the very heart of central London, but it makes up for that very slight inconvenience if you can call it that by being in the very heart of the cool Clerkenwell area. I can't wait to go back. And the fact that they have such green credentials just is the icing on an already delicious cake!!"
22,1282,"Jun 17 2009 	Nice hotel - a little inconvenient	This hotel bucks the boutique hotel standard of chocolate brown and dark rooms in favor of very light and airy decorating. It doesn't all work right, but is a very refreshing change. The rooms are spacious and quiet. I particularly appreciated the interior shutters and double windows. My room was virtually silent.The breakfast at the hotel is substantial - and - unlike most UK hotels - reasonably priced. I didn't feel like I was being gouged.While the hotel is supposedly situated in a trendy area, you could have fooled me. After days of exploring, I really didn't find anything out of the ordinary. My one complaint is that the hotel isn't particularly well located. Getting anywhere typically involved at least one tube transfer. It got a bit tiresome trekking back to the hotel with packages and for a nap."
23,1282,"May 29 2009 	Cool hip and restful	The Zetter is a gem of a small hotel juts dont let the fact that MP Hazel Blears stayed here put you off! I stay here roughly every other month and the staff are welcoming and helpful.The bar and restaurant offer decent meals and reasonably priced drinks for the weary without fuss or an over complicated menu like others!Rooms are on the small size or rather compact but fully functional with decent size beds, the bathrooms are great with powerful showers. My only grumble is the fact that there is no mini bar in the room - you have to put up with a Japanese style vending machine on each floor near the lift shaft, quirky and sometimes annoying late at night!"
24,1282,"May 27 2009 	I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London	We stayed at the Zetter in August 2008 (apologies for the late review).I have nothing but praise for the hotel and its staff, and would stay here again any time I am in London.We got a rooftop suite with a balcony for about the same price as ordinary rooms at luxury hotels which we looked at closer to the centre of London.The room was quite large, with a huge bathroom (with nice toiletries and a rain shower). The bed was insanely comfortable, with great sheets and big pillows. The design of the room was smart and very stylish, but not too minimalist, with a big wardrobe, a desk/workspace, a luggage storage area, and different lighting schemes, all of which could be controlled from near the door or beside the bed. The balcony was small but pleasant, and the room had full length windows with a view over the city in the distance from the Gherkin around to the London Eye. It is the extra touches that made the Zetter a very special experience - free internet, free bottled water (still and sparking), a good selection of CDs on the inhouse entertainment system, free newspapers delivered every morning with a daily note from the hotel with weather and tourist suggestions, mist free mirror in the bathroom, and an interesting and quirky selection of books in the room. The staff were friendly, discreet, helpful and eager to please. Both check in and check out were a breeze. The room was spotless, and the cleaning staff went the extra mile when cleaning the room - arranging toiletries, folding clothes which had been left out, putting books and personal items on the bedside table. The food in the restaurant (for both dinner and breakfast) was really wonderful (particularly the Garlic roasted prawns with chorizo, sweet potato &amp; glazed pork belly, and the selection or pastries and jam in the morning). The cocktail list is imaginative, and the wine list is brilliant. The restaurant also delivers almost its entire menu as room service. The hotel is an easy bus ride to (for example) the British Museum, and a very short walk to Farringdon Tube Station. Overall, this was a wonderfully romantic place to stay, and one of the nicest hotel experiences I have ever had."
25,1282,May 21 2009 	Stylish hotel	Excellent staff and a stylish hotel. Would definitely stay again. Restaurant is very good too. The hotel was faultless from our arrival to departure. The room and bathroom was spacious and very well designed. We had a handwritten note from the manager welcoming us back on our return visit. The staff care and want to create a good impression.
26,1282,"Mar 25 2009 	A home from home	I always love staying at the Zetter! There's free wi fi, loads of CDs to listed to on the TV based entertainment system, you've got Smithfield Market nearby and some good restaurants (although some not open at the weekends so it can be a bit quiet). The 55 bus takes you to Oxford Street and drops you off right by the door on the way back. Make sure you get a room looking onto St.John's Square. Good hotel for breakfast - lots of newspapers and great jams."
27,1282,Feb 18 2009 	Modern and central.	Got a reasonable rate i view of low good exchange rate. Stayed in second cheapest room and this was really quite nice. Can confirm shag carpet which may hide many sins. Nice bathroom with rain shower. Could have nicer toiletries. Restaurant nice looking but service somewhat chaotic. Breakfast too expensive. Recommend lunch at modern pantry across the square.
28,1282,"Feb 16 2009 	An excellent laid back boutique hotel	The Zetter is an excellent hotel with a superb restaurant.My wife and I stayed in a deluxe corner room with a king size bed and it was a good size with quirky Zetter decoration that made it stand out from the run of the mill rooms available in London. Our room was quiet despite it being on the 1st floor and the shuttered windows and balcony, that you can actually open, made it light and airy.The bathroom was great, if a little small and had a wonderful shower .The hotel bar is nice and relaxing and a great place to enjoy a cocktail.The restaurant is superb and offers really high quality italian food as a reasonable.Finally, the staff in the hotel and restaurant are really friendly and made our stay very pleasant"
29,1282,"Feb 16 2009	Noisy but fabulous!	We stayed in one of the rooftop studio suites, which had its own terrace and was worth every penny, in my view. Still, we did suffer from some noise from the street below. But that was the only down side. Lovely bed, lovely touches in the room, great staff, great cocktails (is it any wonder that the Make Me Happy cocktail is a bestseller?). Lots of things you'd actually want in the minibar. We watched a film and hung out and it was fab. So there's no pool and the rooms are smallish. But the location is spot on (have lunch at the Modern Pantry across the road and dinner at a great Viatnamese place called Pho around the corner if you've already eaten in the restaurant) and everyone is really nice to you."
30,1282,Jan 21 2009 	Zetter could be better	I picked The Zetter for convenience and because it is supposed to be one of the hip places to stay in London. I loved the modern styling of the bathroom but my room had shag carpet which creeped me out a bit. I would prefer a floor treatment that is simpler. The industrial style shutters made me feel like I was in a cell instead of a 4 star hotel but it did do the job keeping out the sound and darkening the windows. The restaurant food was nice but expensive.
31,1282,"Jan 20 2009 	Great little gem of a hotel	Stayed at the Zetter in a deluxe room for one night in December on the way back from Bruges. It is a lovely boutique hotel and reasonably priced compared to other London hotels. I would not rate this hotel as a 5 star establishment but if you need a hotel in easy vicinity to Kings Cross or Liverpool street stations then this could be the hotel for you. The rooms are very modern and all have the facilities, ours was very small but fine for one nights stay. There is free tea and coffee available next to the vending machines on each floor and the hotel bar has a nice ambience and good cocktail list. The cooked breakfast is nice but extremely overpriced as is the continental which is nowhere near as good as a genuine continental you would get abroad (a small table with various cereals and yoghurts on). Overall a great little hotel with friendly staff."
32,1282,"Jan 19 2009 	More expensive and not as good as the Hoxton	Stayed Saturday night after staying Friday night at the Hoxton (which was full on Saturday).Arrived about 7.30pm - easy unrestricted parking directly opposite in St John Square. Simple check in.Room facing Clerkenwell road, bit of city noise but we're used to it - even like it!Room pretty small, but rather nice bathroom. Microscopic wardrobe space. Nice bathrobes provided. Lighting nice &amp; very configurable after you find all the switches. Rather small lcd tv. Free internet access, wired (cable too short - bring your own!) or wireless (signal rather poor). Several other providers with good signals.Rip-off prices for anything from the snacks tray in the room, 2 for a small packet of Burts crisps. No kettle in room, but free tea &amp; coffee making facilities by the lift - but shoehorned into too small a space.Bed very comfortable with down quilt and pillows, current issue of Time-Out, Wallpaper and Blueprint in the room, along with some secondhand books - nice touch.As an ex-Londoner I know what to expect of Clerkenwell and it's a charming &quot;villagey&quot; area - especially at weekends - an easy wander-about peacfulness and very close to some very historic areas (wander down St Johns Lane - under the stone archway in the square opposite the hotel, and down towards Smithfield). Yes - the location is a quite a big plus.Check-out equally easy. But - I paid 85 with hotels.com, and then found out at checkout that with vat the actual bill was 100. Bill hikes at check-out don't amuse me, and along with the rip-off pricing of the snacks (and phone, 1/minute for national calls - though I didn't use this, it rather underlines the &quot;opportunistic&quot; pricing) - I'd prefer to see the hotel to be &quot;straight&quot; with the customer - charge what they need to charge to run their business profitably with a clear up-front charge and not try these sorts of tactics.On the whole, I felt that as the Hoxton offered better value, transparent pricing and &quot;extras&quot; at shop prices - the Zetter had let itself down by comparison. It's a very nice hotel though.The smaller room size is an acceptable compromise for a cool location *if* all other things were equal. The Zetter could fix all this up with a &quot;new deal with customers&quot; - someting we're all looking for in the credit crunch!"
33,1282,"Jan 15 2009 	Exactly what we were looking for	We stayed at the Zetter as a stop off on our honeymoon on the way to Marrakech, and arrived in London before the earliest check in time, but the staff helpfully checked us in anyway. We were shown up to our fabulous corner room, which was stylishly decorated and extremely comfortable, with quirky furnishings and huge sash windows. Everything worked perfectly, was spotlessly clean and the entertainment system was easy to use.We had planned to go out for lunch, but liked the look of the Zetter's restaurant so much that instead we decided to stay there to eat. The staff in the restaurant were lots of fun, making us feel very welcome, supplying first class pizza and puddings and then plying us with enough alcohol to make our short walk to Farringdon tube a truly hilarious experience. After a sobering afternoon's shopping (spending most of our honeymoon budget on the King's Road), we arrived back at the hotel to get ready to go out for dinner, and this was possibly the best part of our stay. We took full advantage of the small but extremely relaxing shower room, entertainment system and ambient lighting.We dined at Konstam (quintessentially quirky and fabulous, the best chicken and duck's liver we've ever eaten) and walked back to the Zetter, contemplating going out for the evening, but the bed was too comfortable and we decided on an early night ;o)The next day we had a leisurely start, a fantastic breakfast then checked out and were able to leave our bags at the hotel whilst we went for a wander down to St. Paul's before embarking on the epic tube ride to Heathrow.We will definitely be back, we plan to spend a weekend there for our anniversary and make the most of it, and if we could we'd move in."
34,1282,"Jan 2 2009	Not bad but not great either	Oh dear - I booked this through Tablet and whilst it looks good on the site it isn't as good in the flesh. The lobby and and atrium are impressive but our room was a bit dreary. It has really annoying shutters opening onto Clerkenwell Road that don't close properly, the decor was not that cool, a bit sludgy, the bed was way too small and it was 230 a night.The Modern Pantry and Cicada around the corner are very good for beakfast and dinner resepctively."
35,1282,"Dec 15 2008 	Absolutely great	We chose the Zetter as the cheapest hotel nearest The Barbican, at only 99 for the room. We also payed 20 for the parking space which saved us from finding an NCP nearby. We had little expectation, due to the fact it was so cheap (compared to other hotels in the area) Well from the moment we got in the hotel we were surprised, the staff could not do enough for us, our room was clean, neat, stylish and had everything we needed to relax including a hot water bottle. Some people may find the rooms too modern, The vending machine mini bar system was expensive but no more than any other hotel I have stayed in. We decided to pay the additional 50 per head for the dinner and breakfast option. In the resturant the service was just as attentive, and the food was amazing and presented wonderfully, breakfast was just as great too so turned out to be a great additional option (we were not charged for any soft drink we had for either meal) . 100 per person may sound expensive for dinner bed and breakfast but we thought for the food we ate, and the superb service we received throughout our stay, it was well worth every penny and would go back"
36,1282,"Nov 14 2008 	Eye for detail	The Zetter; Restaurant and Rooms.The first thing you notice is the wonderfull staff, they really went out of their way to help out with London hints and tips. The room was fresh and the terrace was a treat. After you figured out how to turn down the heat the room is really confortable. Fresh linnen, a paper on you doorstep. Coffee (espresso) machine in the room. The restaurant serves quality food for a reasonable price.All and all a great stay.Jan"
37,1282,"Nov 7 2008 	A must for anyone staying in the Clerkenwell area	My boyfriend and I stayed at The Zetter over the August Bank Holiday weekend earlier this year and we absolutely loved it!We were only there for two nights and we only wished we could stay longer. When we arrived the staff were helpful and went out of their way to help us whether it was in the form of giving us directions or information on the area. We were impressed when someone escorted us up to our room and explained to us about all the amenities and facilities. Very few hotels take the time with each guest. We stayed in the deluxe corner room which was a little smaller than expected but perfectly formed. Everything was provided for in the room with the added bonus of the tea/coffee facilities and vending machines on each floor. A novel and brilliant idea! The rainfall shower was a wonderful feature and all the modern dcor and touches throughout the hotel made it feel special and different to the standard hotel rooms nowadays.Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner is a must in the restaurant and the location is ideal for other great restaurants, bars and clubs walking distance from the hotel. I cant say nicer things about the hotel. Its a definite must for anyone staying in the Clerkenwell area!"
38,1282,"Oct 5 2008 	Pretty special	Pros:Very cleanStaff brilliant (especially Miguel)Good locationGreat designComfy bedGreat mini barGreat communal spaces especially the barCons:Very expensive. From 1.30 for a small bag of maltesters from the vending machine, to a charge to bring room service food to the room, to a charge for the toothbrush and toothpaste pack it all added up to a collossal bill. Maybe its standard London prices to pay 500 for 2 nights in the second most basic room exclusive of food, i dont know, but i got a bit of a fright. if thats not an issue for you though its pretty superb"
39,1282,"Sep 29 2008 	Stylish and comfortable	We stayed for Saturday night, booked on the Friday and paid 135 for a 'superior' room booked direct on the hotel's website - the 'seasonal rate' which includes vat - so not sure why the previous reviewer coughed up so much! Room was lovely and spacious, overlooking St John's Square. 2 comfy armchairs, lovely comfy bed, great waterfall shower. It's about a 5 minute walk from Farrindgon tube so very easy to get into the city centre. Breakfast was very pricey - 16 for the full English but that included a massive buffet with some lovely fruit, much nicer bread and jam than you usually get from hotel buffets, and endless coffee. We'd definitely go back, and would recommend checking the hotel website for their own best prices."
40,1282,"Sep 21 2008 	Overpriced for an Ikea room	Simply put, I felt the c.190 we paid for an overnight stay on a Saturday night (exclusive of breakfast) offered poor value for money vis-a-vis other nearby hotels I have stayed in. Standard grumbles: bed too small, too noisy, temperatures turned up to 'roasting' etc. Most of these points I could have forgiven at a lower price point. In the spirit of objectivity, the staff were friendly and the bottled tap water by my bed was provided gratis."
41,1282,"Aug 27 2008	What a great place	One of the best if not the best hotel i have stayed in. Very friendly staff, beautifully finnished with really nice touches through out. My only negative comment would be the rooms are perhaps a touch small for some people, ours was a standard room so larger ones are availiable . Would stay there again without a doubt.Great restaurants nearby too on Exmouth market!"
42,1282,"Aug 9 2008 	Good Hotel	I stayed here for one night.Reception: Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room: It was spotless, comfortable and I had plenty of space. Bathroom: Spotless also. A nice touch was the shaving and dental packs left for those of us who forget both on occasion. They cost 2 pounds each but from a convenience perspective, they are potentially well worth it. Location: It is quite near the Farrington tube stop and from that point of view is &quot;Centrally located&quot;. Overall it is a nice boutique hotel. If you want to avoid the chains, and stay in a unique environment in central London. then I would definitely recommend it."
43,1282,"Jul 28 2008 	Cramped out of it but well designed	My husband and I stayed here in September 07 for 2 night as we were in London to watch Prince. First of all - getting to this hotel by public transport made us feel a little uneasy. It was a 5 minute walk from Farringdon tube station and because it was the weekend this part of London was deserted and we felt vunerable walking to and from the hotel - especially at night when we were going out for the evening (we assumed it may be different when people are at work during the week). This was compounded by the fact that there were several shady looking characters hanging around the tube station and surrounding streets.The hotel itself is very nice. It has a fantastic chic boutique design with loads of retro features, and the balcony which the rooms are situated off is a great sight. However, the room itself was really small. No room at all to hang clothes - maybe one or two items, nowhere to put hair brush, makeup, shoes. It was literally the bed and maybe one or two feet either side of that and a bathroom. Also, although this hotel is newish, it is starting to look worn due to the carpet choices they have made and the flooring in the bathroom.One evening we ate at the hotel restaurant, which was lovely food. We had a fantastic meal. It had a really cool young vibe and we had breakfast there too which was also really nice.All in all, if you need to stay in this part of London and dont mind a small room, then go for it - it is clean, stylish and serves great food."
44,1282,"Jul 21 2008 	Perfect friendly hotel	We stayed here on a short 3 day break in London. We stayed in a St John's Room and it was a good size, plenty of room, even with a cot for our 10 month old daughter. Staff were all very friendly and very accommodating, they even stored our daughter's meals in their fridge and heated them up for us at the start of each day. We had booked the room on a weekend deal including breakfast and the breakfast was well worth it, all cooked to perfection. We have stayed in a number of small boutique hotels inn London and although a little less central this was by far the best all round hotel."
45,1282,"Jun 29 2008	Sleepless in Room 118	Stayed two nights in this funky Clerkenwell Hotel. Two gripes. The first night was fairly sleepless due a low rumbling noise coming from the ceiling which was too noisy for sleep, yet too quiet to force you to get up from your bed and set the complaining engine in motion.Next morning we were moved to a room with a silent ceiling, but there was now offer of compensation, not even a free glass of water!Second gripe is that the beds are small as mentioned by other reviewers.Apart from that, the stay was great!Hey! Zetter! Get that noisy ceiling fixed!"
46,1282,"Jun 18 2008 	Great for Clerkenwell business stays	This is a good choice if you're in Clerkenwell on business. It's a small/boutique hotel, very centrally located, decent breakfast and good evening drink spot. We stayed here a handful of times on frequent trips to London and the staff is courteous, helpful and friendly. The rooms are SMALL, even by London standards. Not much room to hang your clothes - so if you're a man traveling with a hanging bag or more than 1 or 2 suits, beware. Comfortable beds, clean rooms, decent bathrooms - all just a bit past their peak as far as the mod trends. But overall, good choice."
47,1282,"Jun 16 2008 	Phenomenal service	Just a delighful hotel. I stayed in both a single and a rooftop studio. The single is small - but fine for one person. All rooms are nicely done with cute, kitschy detail. May also be the first hotel ever that doesn't nickle-and-dime guests (lovely details - like a complementary espresso machine just outside the room and complementary bottles of water in the room). Rooms may be between 3 and 4 star - but service is definitely 5-star in every respect. Only disappointment was that I booked last minute on a very busy week, so they couldn't accomodate my whole stay - I moved to the 5-star Sofitel St. James, where the rooms were elegant and the service was horrible by contrast to this little gem. And, though London restaurants are rarely much to write home about - the Zetter's is among the best I've tried in that city. The Zetter is my new favorite place in London - I'll stay there every time I return."
48,1282,"Jun 13 2008 	excellent trendy	trendy, but not with the excess of some edgy hotels.excellent room and definitely one of the best restaurants in town."
49,1282,"May 21 2008 	Pleasant 	Booked a rooftop studio as a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend. When we arrived they told us they upgraded us to a deluxe rooftop room, which was lovely! Really funky room, with everything you needed, plus an excellent minibar selection. Lovely views across London &amp; really comfy bed. Cocktails were delicious in the bar and the food in the restaurant was the best meal I have had this year! I would go back just for the restaurant."
50,1282,"May 15 2008 	Perfect place for younger/ more style-conscious travelers	Stayed in one of the top-floor studios (506) and could not have been happier. The Zetter's nailed all the basics--good bed and bath, kind and helpful staff, nice room amenities--but it's the little details that really pleased me, e.g. the iPod speakers, the quirky design elements, The Idler and campy 60s paperbacks on the nightstand. The little strip of a balcony was a pleasure in the evening with a bottle of wine and a friend. The location could not be better...well, depending on what you're in the Old Smoke for. All the nightlife, galleries, restaurants and shops in Clerkenwell and Shoreditch are in walking distance, which for me is perfect. However, if you're after a central London location and want to be near the main tourist destinations--or if you want the services available only at larger hotels--you'd probably be better off staying somewhere else."
51,1282,"May 12 2008 	A great hotel	We recently stayed in a roof top studio at the Zetter and had a great stay. really friendly and responsive staff throughout our stay. in particular we appreciated the hotel staff going out of their way to have our room made available several hours before check in as we'd just flown in from australia. the room is not large but its been made very comfortable with a great bed and lots of other small touches. really liked the free music library accessed through the TV and the free in room wi fi. the studios come with tea and coffee making facilities in the room but the free espresso machines on each floor are a great touch too. the real winner is the roof top patio with views out over the london skyline and a great place to sit and have breakfast or read. it was sunny during our stay so we really appreciated having our own little piece of outside in london. the restaurant is excellent both for breakfast and dinner. try and get a package with breakfast included as the al la carte breakfast menu is fantastic. we also chose to have dinner there several times as it was so good. location wise, clerkenwell has a lot of character of its own and has some interesting local history and some large markets nearby but it is a bit out of the way if you're looking for the bright lights of areas like soho. having said that, the tube stop is just down the road so very easy to get around and the few times we did get a taxi it was always less than ten pounds a trip. a very friendly and well run hotel."
52,1282,"Apr 26 2008 	Stylish hotel great value for London	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Zetter for 3 nights. Rooms were very stylish and clean... Really tiny but we weren't in the room much more than for sleeping anyways. Staff was helpful and accommodating. When we checked in, they treated us to a round of drinks while we waited for our room to finish getting made up. The TV in our room was broken and the staff went out of their way to get us another one. It wasn't a big deal but they wanted us to be happy. The hotel is a little out of the way from the hustle &amp; bustle of the city; but just a few blocks from the Ferringdon tube stop so it was easy to get anywhere we needed to go. Would stay here again."
53,1282,"Mar 29 2008 	Truly fabulous!	For a very special birthday weekend, decided to stay in the city we live in, but enjoy a bit of luxury. I booked a top floor suite with a balcony (and a rate that included breakfast) directly from the hotel. It certainly did not disappoint!Firstly the service from the hotel was exceptional - right from the time I booked on the phone (when they invited me to come and view which suite I would like), to the moment we checked out. I stay in hotels a lot, but was refreshingly surprised by the warm, professional and efficient manner of the staff. My ONLY disappointment was in the restaurant, where things were too slow.The room was gorgeous, but won't be to the liking of traditionalists. The bed was really comfortable and the attention to detail was fab (umbrella for rainy London, decent hairdryer, nice magazines and books, low level lighting option, decent range of drinks and snacks, an ipod dock that actually has good speaker, solar powered light for balcony, FREE bottled water from the well and lovely robes and slippers - the last of which I was happy to pay the 4 for, but they said I were complimentary!). They certainly have made good use of the weird space on the top floor, so even for girls who pack too much, there is lots of storage. (also there is a lovely hairdresser round the corner and I got 10% off by mentioning I was staying in the hotel!)We only had breakfast in the hotel, but its a good place to walk from and also near to tube lines for getting around for a good weekend.I'll definitely go again."
54,1282,Mar 9 2008 	Nice hotel food a little pricey	I stayed in the corner double deluxe room in Oct 07. The room and hotel were very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The food I ordered from room service although nice was expensive (19 lamb curry and 16:50 for the breakfast) An excellent hotel in a fashionable part of town close to all attractions. Would deffinitely stay again.
55,1282,"Feb 6 2008	Excellent staff and service	First and foremost-- excellent service. In fact, I've not stayed at a hotel with such attentive staff in a while. The room was nice- clean and stylish. Could have used a closet. Overall, the service made up for any issues with the room. Also, the food was excellent. In fact, I would have preferred only eating at the hotel. Highly recommend and great location."
56,1282,"Jan 10 2008 	Stylish comfortable and friendly hotel with loads of nice touches	We spent 6 nights in a rooftop studio superior. The room (#507) was very comfortable and stylish and of a reasonable size.The room was furnished with a queen sized bed, a decent cupboard (with safe), desk and chair, 2 arm chairs and a coffee table and a media centre.The bathroom was also reasonable in size with a great strong shower (in bath). The bathroom products were lovely, as were the soft fluffy white towels.The heating in the room was great.Coffee and tea making facilities and a nice mini bar (with reasonable prices!) was in the room. The lower floors each have a vending machines for coffee and food and we made use of those too.Our room had a small terrace which had views north (could see telecom tower and a predominantly inner city view looking towards Exmouth market). The terrace was furnished with a table and chairs. Unfortunately it was too wet during our stay to really make good use of this outdoor area.The room had a lot of nice touches:- free clerkenwell water (from the well below the hotel)- free wi-fi (in the room)- daily newspaper with a tourist info sheet attached listing suggestions for that day (eg which markets are on, if there are any special events etc)- local area information detailing eating and shopping options- London Timeout (and other magazines) provided in room- ipod docking station- a groovy tivoli alarm clock radioThe only minor complaint we have is that our room was just outside the lift and we did experience a bit of noise which disturbed us a few times, particularly in the middle of the night.We used the cool hotel bar a few times (great spot to meet friends) and ate in the restaurant too (the breakfast is excellent).We found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly.The hotel location was good too. There are some interesting walks in the immediate area. It was about a 15 min walk to St. Paul's cathedral and less than 5 minutes to the closest tube. An oxford st bus route stops just outside the hotel. There were lots of nice places to eat in the immediate area, including pubs , cafes and fancier restaurants and there are a couple of street markets very close too."
57,1282,"Nov 21 2007 	good value in London	Room was clean and well designed, hotel staff were very friendly, breakfast was great, and the location near perfect."
58,1282,"Nov 6 2007 	zetter	We stayed at the Zetter for one week; it proved to be a cute charming little hotel in an excellent location for those wanting something away from the touristy. Our room was ok comfortable, the room seemed to be striving for a chic demure but falling short of its goal. The biggest draw back with the room is the almost non-existent place to store or hang clothes if you will be there for more than a minute there is absolutely no closet or drawer space pass hanging two suits or one suit and an overcoat. While we found the hotel cozy we felt it not worthy of the $500.00 a night price tag we paid for our room (when we left the hotel we spent the next three weeks at the Hotel Suez ($150.00 a night) in Paris, and the room was easily comparable to the rooms at the Zetter and next week I will be staying at the Sagamore in Lake George, New York $400.00 a night room and well worth the price.) Anyhoo, forgive me I digress; but I thought it best to put the room in perspective the area surrounding the Zetter provides a pleasant and enjoyable neighborhood to walk around, and public and private transportation are readily available. There are quite a number of very nice restaurants in the area, delightfully enjoyable at very reasonable prices. (Benugo - breakfast place, Raj - Tandoori, La Cucina  Italian, Langeleto (not in the neighborhood near Oxford Circus) and the food at the Hotel Zetter is very nice."
59,1282,Oct 31 2007 	Will be back soon !!	Stayed the Zetter Saturday and Sunday in room 111 (a superior rear of the hotel) as we had asked for a quiet room and it was perfect. The staff were fantastic and made you feel at home at all times. Ate in the restaurant both nights and the food was spot on and the wine was fairly priced by London standards and although there was much less of a buzz about the place on the Sunday it was lovely to come back after watching a dismal American football match at Wembley.Tubes and bars very close by and its only 20 mins walk to St Pauls so it is not as far out as you may think. The breakfast was really good especially the freshly cooked English which is included in the weekend rate.We will definitely use the hotel when next in London as its a total change from the standard chain variety.
60,1282,"Oct 15 2007 	Small room enough for one person cramped for two	Stayed a Saturday night as we attended a wedding reception nearby. Check in was friendly, although the staff did not seem to know about the confusing parking signs in St Johns Sq behind the hotel. Did not risk it and parked in the NCP up the road. I had booked a standard &quot;Guest&quot; room via the hotel website and was told at check in that I would be given a &quot;nice&quot; room. Now I quite like a funky hotel, but it has to be comfortable too. I found the 2nd floor room facing the Clerkenwell Road to be small, stuffy and not quite up to the standard I expected. The window shutter system does not do enough to shut out the noise, especially from the bar across the road at chucking out time. The bed was comfy enough but a small double. Persons Of Restricted Growth may feel that it is a kingsize and it would be fine for single occupancy, but I found it on the cramped side. The shower was by far the best bit, a good drenching overhead rose provided loads of water. The small oblong basin seems to only be good for bathing a baby iguana and occasional tooth brushing. There is no coffee/tea making facilities in the room but a free coffee machine on the 1st and 4th floors. I have to say that I did find it a pain getting dressed to go and get an OK-ish mug of coffee. Word of warning here - wear shoes when using the stairs. They are nicely carpeted, but edged in steel so tend to cut into the soles of your bare feet when nipping out. We did not have time for brekkie, probably would not have tried it anyway as the price of 16.50 for the Full English seems a bit steep. All in all, I thought that we would have been better off up the road in the Holiday Inn, a bigger room, a bigger bed, and tea/coffee in the room all for two thirds of the price that I paid here."
61,1282,"Oct 9 2007 	Nothing could be better than the Zetter!	Loved the Zetter. Stayed here for several nights in May 2007. Unique hotel with excellent attention to detail. Enjoyed the views from a rooftop studio. If you're looking for hip, fun accommodations, the Zetter is for you!"
62,1282,"Sep 22 2007 	Very carefully designed and run hotel	The cost of the room was in excess of 250, but as it was a last minute booking and everything cheaper in London seemed to be full, my employer picked up the bill for a night in one of the Studios at the Zetter. Check in was very efficient and the room itself was fantastic, with lots of nice touches, which suggested that someone had spent a great deal of time thinking about making guests' stays as comfortable as possible. The best &quot;extra&quot; was that fresh milk was brought to the room during the evening and put in the mini bar, so that I could have a decent cup of tea the next morning - why don't more hotels do this instead of providing cartons of UHT? There was an excellent radio next to the bed and a rather complicated television, which apparently also doubled up as a computer, with free internet access. On the small rooftop terrace there were two chairs and a table from which there was a decent view over the rooftops. Breakfast the next morning was good - an enormous cooked breakfast, as well as a comprehensive buffet. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. If a cheaper hotel had been available I would have used it - indeed the Zetter has cheaper rooms, but overall I felt that the experience justified the price."
63,1282,"Sep 11 2007	The best Hotel in London by far!	I discovered the Zetter through work and have stayed a few times whilst on business. However, the hotel truly comes into its own when staying for pleasure! My wife and I travelled to London with our six week old daughter to be greeted in the usual relaxed yet professional way. Check in was friendly and timely. Our room was ready for us along with a travel cot made up to the standard of a guest bed with its own towel set for our Daughter...Magic!!! The Zetter's usual style and atmosphere was present and correct along with it's quirky sense of humour. Every member of the team who met us were freindly, professional and supportive to our needs as a young family. We did not feel out of place with our baby daughter. If you go try a &quot;make me happy&quot; cocktail and don't forget Eggs Benedict for brunch helped along with a superb Bloody Mary. My thanks again to the team for a truly memorable stay!"
64,1282,"Aug 31 2007 	Fantastic Hotel!	My Husband and I stayed at the Zetter for two nights on a weekend in Aug. It was the best hotel we've stayed at in London. Check in was quick, friendly and efficient. We were up graded TWICE to a corner delux roof top suit. It was amazing! When we asked why? The staff said just because they were not busy over the weekend. The area of Clerkenwell was relaxing, safe and had some fabulous pubs and places to eat. We felt 'at home' straight away, which normally does'nt happen for us in London.We had our first lunch on our terrace, the second at the Slaughtered Lamb. Both were great. We went to see Prince on the Sat night and staff gave us great advice re tubes etc. We ate at Fifteen on the Sunday night and again staff were very helpful re taxi's. Breakfast had great choice and a lovely room to eat it in. Over all, as soon as we can afford to go back we will.Jane and Paul Casement, Manchester"
65,1282,"Aug 28 2007 	Ideal Location for Hotel	The Zetter is ideally situated for all areas of London. 5-8 mins walk from Farringdon Tube Station, the bus stop for the No 55 Bus to the West End is just across the road.Small but functional reception area, with welcoming and efficient staff. I arrived about 1.30 ( Check-in from 2pm ) and our room was ready. We were upgraded to one of the best rooms, on the corner of the top floor. I was taken up to the room and shown where everything was and how things worked.A great room with a fantastic roof terrace, 2 sunloungers, ( shame it was not warm enough really to sit out, although I did eventually notice there was an infra lamp, that actually gave out a reasonable amount of heat.The bed was huge and very comfortable to sleep on. Great coffee machine in the room, with fresh milk delivered to the room. The room was a reasonable size as well. and very quiet, view over the back of the hotel. Bathroom small but adequate, shower was wonderful, although if you don't want to get your hair wet, best to wear a shower cap!The only bad points about the room were that the tall lamp, which I think was made of pottery had been knocked over at some point before we checked in and was broken in 2 places. It should really have either be repaired or replaced. There was also a rug on the floor that had a couple of dirty marks on it.Breakfast was excellent although a little pricey 14-15 a head.All in all a great hotel. We would definately stay at The Zetter in the future.Restaurant recommendation: Smiths of Smithfield 5-10 walk, near Farringdon Tube"
66,1282,"Aug 7 2007 	Good and Bad	I booked this hotel through the Mr and Mrs Smith online booking system as a surprise for my husband's birthday-weekend. And, like many of the other reviewers here, found the location fantastic and the staff very amenable and friendly. Overall the aesthetic and decor is modern and whimsical. We stayed in room 111 (I booked a superior room but not sure what the difference is) that was disappointedly a bit tired. It really needed a makeover, even if just to touch up all the scuffs in the paint. It was a marvel of little space saving ideas, like the tiny little bookshelf, the inset lights, the pocket door on the bathroom. And, it was very quiet  we were never disturbed by noise from outside or other guests. Overall, the room was very small, the wardrobe held about 2 items. If you unfolded and used the suitcase stand, you couldn't walk the path through the room, you would have to climb over it or the bed. The rain head shower was fantastic - loved it. We enjoyed the free digital music that was provided but found it impossible to use the DVD player (the DVD we brought with us didn't work, nor did the one that had been left in the room). The free wireless worked very well. The coffee/tea facilities are free but not in the room. They don't give you an ice bucket for your room, just little plastic bowls that hold about a half-cup of crushed ice. So, you see it is a fun hotel, but at more than 180 per night, you want your room to feel fresh and clean and be able to either hang up your clothes or if not the at least be able to access your suitcase easily. We only have weekends in London 4 or 5 timess a year but would probably try another new one next time."
67,1282,"Jul 30 2007 	Wonderful Rooms	We stayed at The Zetter for one night, It was perfectly located for us, one stop from Kings Cross. The room was fabulous! Very retro but very comfortable and to a high standard. We were very impressed with the free coffee and tea making machines on the landing and being able to look down inside the middle of the hotel was very unusual. The staff were friendly and the bar was good for relaxing in after a day in London. We didn't use the Restaurant but the menu looked good."
68,1282,Jul 29 2007	Outstanding stay	Excellent staying in Zetter Hotel!All the services with high quality and people were very sympathetic!
69,1282,"Jul 27 2007 	Funky place	If you want to stay somewhere a bit different, and not in the usual tourist areas, then the Zetter could be the place for you. Its fairly pricey (200 B&amp;B + bottle of Prosecco sparkling Italian wine (actually pretty nice)) but was good value.It is a five storey place that has been given a funky, modern look. The rooms are fairly small, but are nicely done, and are a bit different from your average, chain hotel. The free access CD library (via the telly) is a good touch. The wireless broadband access (again via the telly) is ok, but you have to pay 10 for 24 hrs as a minimum. The bathrooms are really nicely finished, and the rainfall showers are fantastic.The public areas of the hotel are not massive, but then it is not a massive hotel. But they too are funky, including the 5 storey atrium, lit in neon red at night.We didn't eat in the restaurant - we intended too, and had high hopes, but the menu disappointed. On our visit, there were only about 5 mains to choose from, and 2 of those were pizza. However, we did have a couple of post-dinner cocktails on our return, and can throroughly recommend a Smithfield Pony (7.50). The breakfast (not included in every package, but was in ours) was really nice. A la carte hot breakfast, plus a good selection of breads, pastries, fruits and cereals, all of them good quality. Service was pretty painfully slow it has to be said. We had to flag down a waiter for a menu after waiting nearly ten minutes, and then flag the same chap down 15 minutes later to place our order. The full english was worth the wait though, a good size and high quality. The same could be said about my wife's smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.The hotel itself is on Clerkenwell Road, less than 5 minutes walk from Farringdon tube. At weekends, there surrounding area is not exactly rammed full, but there were a few busy looking bars - one directly opposite the hotel, and the famous Turnmills club is about 100 yards away. To walk (at a fairly good pace) to Covent Garden takes about 25 minutes, St Pauls just over 10 and the Tate Modern between 20 and 25.Ok, you could get hotels nearer to the main areas, but we really enjoyed staying somewhere smaller that wasn't right in the thick of it, like the West End hotels are. We'd definitely stay there again..."
70,1282,Jul 27 2007	A place to call home!	I keep booking over and over rooms at the Zetter for friends and family staying in London and never been disappointed! Impeccable service that comes always with a big smile on everybody's faces and even if I have eaten in the restaurant only a couple of times ...the food was delicius and the atmosphere funky. LOVE IT!
71,1282,"Jul 26 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	I visited the Zetter on the 12th July for lunch with a business colleague. I love the style of this hotel, if you like Boutique then you will love the Zetter. The service from the Receptionist right through to the Restaurant staff was superb and extremely accommodating. The hotel is a breath of fresh air from the normal quite stuffy venues that you can find in the City and I really enjoyed the relaxed, friendly nature of the staff, they made us feel at ease as soon as we arrived. The food was excellent with plenty of choice on the menu for a lunch, the service was equally excellent. I did have the opportunity to view one of the bedrooms for a future stay I am planning for my partner and I. The bedrooms are very stylish whilst still feeling homely for a boutique hotel, I'd certainly recommend one of the suites with the balcony views, also the view from the top of the avery to the lounge area below is quite dramatic. I'd have no problem recommending this hotel for anyone looking for a business or leisure trip."
72,1282,"Jul 24 2007 	Love that hotel!	A second stay for us at the Zetter and we again had a fantastic time. I am amazed by some of the less than ecstatic reviews I have seen - it is my favourite hotel in London and one I don't hesitate to recommend. Ticks all the boxes - quirky, polite, chic, unpretentious, yummy food, smiling happy staff.What more do you want!!!!!"
73,1282,"Jul 18 2007 	spectations exceeded	we went for dinner at the restaurant last friday, 13th july 2007.it was four of us and we have the most amazing dinner ever. starter, main course and dessert. we also have wine and we only paid 150.00. great for such a nice restaurant, great location too.would advise everyone to go and try."
74,1282,"Jul 18 2007	Loved it!	I had a wonderful time at The Zetter, the room had a great view and was a good size, the food was great and the service very nice... a beautiful touch: they have their own water!! The location is also with great access to the city and very lively night area... Definetely will come back!"
75,1282,"Jul 5 2007 	Loved it - will definitely stay again	I booked my husband and I a night away in London as a surprise for our wedding anniversary. My sister who is a travel agent had recommended The Zetter as she thought it was just our style. How right she was! The staff at the reception area were extremely helpful and attentive. I usually find the staff extremely rude in London hotels, though I think this may be a language barrier thing as they are nearly always foreign with very poor English. Any doubts I had regarding The Zetter were quickly forgotten. They asked if we were local, if we wanted to know anything about the area, whether we wanted dinner reservations, breakfast in bed etc. Always smiling and chatty. I mentioned it was our anniversary and later that evening we returned to our room to find a bottle of wine with a handwritten postcard from the manager, Justin, expressing his congratulations. Not something you hear everyday.I booked us a St John's Superior room which was lovely (room 411). I thought it was about normal size for a city hotel and it certainly wasn't tiny but made excellent use of space. Bathroom was clean and modern and the shower was AMAZING. I wish I could have one in my home. Bath robes are lovely and comfortable. Bed was fabulous.Reception area was lovely if you're into quirky, retro styling. The bar area is fantastic with great decor. We took our Mr &amp; Mrs Smith card which gives you a complimentary cocktail. The cocktails were fabulous and the bar staff were very attentive and chatty.Location is not too bad - a 10 minute walk to the tube and a 20 minute walk to Covent Garden. I think there are a couple of clubs nearby if that's your sort of thing, but it wasn't for us!Only complaints are: no complimentary toothpaste - you have to pay 2 for a (really cute) dental kit; DVD player was constantly skipping or freezing; Internet isn't free either which is a real shame."
76,1282,"Jul 2 2007 	Didn't get it	Booked a 2 night weekend stay at the Zetter and as 2 girls sharing was advised to upgrade to a St Johns Sq superior room at a rate of 170 per night incl bfast which was supposedly a bigger room with a queen bed. We decided to splash out on a really nice hotel as a treat for the weekend.On checking in, we were amazed at the size of the tiny room which had a double bed. After half an hour of the front desk faffing about (totally disorganised), we were eventually moved to a similar room, still not 170 worth in my opinion. We were overall really disappointed with the hotel, rooms were like grey cells of mdf and the &quot;wallpaper art&quot; was a rectangle of fabric on the wall. A bit of neon lighting too - really not worth the pricetag and photography on website makes it look better than it is. We decided to check out after 1 night as the hotel did nothing to address our issues as they were full both nights and seemed to be much more interested in the wedding guests arriving. We moved to Threadneedles for another 10 per night. Was like going from rags to riches. Worlds apart."
77,1282,"Jun 23 2007 	Nice experience	Stayed at the Zetter on a business trip. A really unique hotel. I live in downtown Chicago so I'm used to a bit of noise every now and then and didn't have an issue with it as other travelers seemed to. I had a double bed, flat panel tv with interactive features such as music selections and movies. Bathroom had a great rain shower. Would stay again."
78,1282,"Jun 21 2007 	You can do better for the price.......	Small unimpressive reception - check-in was efficient, if uninformative about the amenities, breakfast times etc.Standard double room was on the small side, ok if you're on your own, but would have been cramped for 2 people, as would have been the bed. Modern, stylish decor, though I wasn't keen on the drab, khaki colour scheme.Small tv, with only a handful of channels, controlled through the PC, which made it slow &amp; cumbersome to operate.I wasn't tempted by the breakfast, which seemed expensive at 16.50 for an 'English', in a hotel that is minimalist in most other respects. There is a Tesco just round the corner though.On the plus side it is in a good location, only a short walk from Farringdon tube station, and just over a mile from Kings Cross - near to Sadlers Wells, St Paul, Tate Modern &amp; with many restaurants nearby. You also get a free Guardian newspaper (though a cut down version) and a informative newsheet with weather forecast &amp; local attraction/events, which was a nice touch.In summary, a nice, modern, stylish hotel, though for the price (134 for a standard room at the weekend), I would suggest you try Malmaison, just round the corner, with larger rooms, more amenities, a nicer building, and a bargain at 134 a night (including breakfast) if you book through Superbreak, or The Hoxton Hotel, again significantly cheaper."
79,1282,"Jun 12 2007 	Small but perfectly formed!	Myself &amp; my wife had a lovely 3 night stay at The Zetter. The location is a key strength; very close to a selection of trendy bars &amp; restaurants, in a safe area of the city, and with easy access to the West End.The staff were always friendly &amp; were very detailed in explaining how the complex TV/DVD/MP3 system worked in our room. They responded to any requests we had in a matter of minutes.The room itself was very impressive, if a little small. There wasn't much storage space, a lack of spare carpet space and the bed was a small double but other than that it was great - funky lighting, nice decor, modern bathroom with 'rain-style' drop shower and some decent finishing touches. Free ice &amp; water was also a nice touch.Overall, it is pricey but if you can cope with living in a small space then it is a great place to stay."
80,1282,"Jun 12 2007	Loved it	Stayed at this hotel for two nights late last month (May 07) during a business trip to London. As far as location is concerned it is probably not the no.1 choice for those visiting London for pure leisure as there are others more central. For business purposes, particularly if you have to be near Farringdon, this is definitely a very good choice. Guess the boutique label is a bit overstated but it surely have a few interesting distinctive features. Te room was spacious (guess I was lucky with no less than 4 windows overlooking the street in front), books on the bedside (this was a novelty for me), broadband internet connection  free of charge, vending machines on every floor and a great, but I mean great, restaurant/breakfast room. I have no doubts recommending it and will definitely be back."
81,1282,"Jun 10 2007 	I wanted to love this place.	My chance to stay at The Zetter came only recently when I was visiting London with my girlfriend and wanted to stay somewhere close to the &quot;action&quot; - Farringdon, the City (for going out and sightseeing) and the West End (for shopping). I booked directly with The Zetter but then found a better deal through Mr and Mrs Smith, so sent a very clear email instruction about 4 weeks before I travelled to cancel the original reservation. I didn't receive a response from The Zetter, but didn't think anything of this but thinking back, I should have probably made sure my old reservation was cancelled.As we arrived at the hotel on the Sunday evening, the staff serving us at reception were very frosty. I explained that we booked through Mr and Mrs Smith and showed my card. No mention was made of the complimentary cocktail that you should get on arrival. Not to worry.We were showed to our room and to be honest it wasn't very big and for the money I would expect to have a bit of space around the double bed to move around. It felt very cramped. We paid extra for a rooftop room and the view did not disappoint. We were treated to glorious views of the City and the rest of London plus the weather was fantastic so the beautiful blue skies definitely added to the experience. London was quite warm, and a bit of air-conditioning would have been nice. However, the room's aircon wasn't working properly so we had to keep the windows open. Again, not something you'd expect from a GBP245 per night room. Bed was very comfortable and the room definitely was style. I really liked the touch of having an iPod dock and the other small touches were nice.Bathroom was a perfect example of making the most of a small space - gave me some great ideas for renovating my own place! I don't think it is nit picking to note that the towels were consistently like drying yourself with sandpaper. Perhaps some fabric softener would have been nice - it felt like the towels hadn't been replaced since the hotel's opening and they had a grey-ish look to them.As I say in my title, I really wanted to love this place. I have dined at the hotel restaurant a few times and I have always liked the hotel's vibe. I wanted to avoid a big chain because I wanted personal service. As the days passed, I realised that noone behind the desk said &quot;good morning&quot; as you went out in the morning nor did anyone say &quot;good evening&quot; when you came back at night. This you might expect in a 400 room Hilton but not in a 56 room hotel such as The Zetter.The final complaint and I have left the best until last. On the Tuesday morning at 8.30 my cell phone rang and it was a very rude receptionist asking where I was as I had not turned up for the original booking that I made directly with the hotel. I explained that I had made a subsequent booking through Mr and Mrs Smith and had sent a cancellation email to [--]. The receptionist told me that they had not received this mail and she would have to speak to her manager about the cancellation fee. At this point I was made to question my own sanity and I would like to add that I have subsequently checked by sent items to find the mail with the confirmation code clearly stated. I told the receptionist that I had already checked into the hotel - could they not have detected that I was the same M. O'Leary from Singapore? Apparently not. I said that I was not prepared to pay a cancellation fee and would check out immediately if this was levied - I was then told not to be too hasty by the rude receptionist. Again, this isn't a massive hotel and I felt that the service quality was overall pretty poor; especially how this situation was dealt with. The fact that they had made an admin error was made out to be my fault and I was repeatedly told that they were fully booked last night and had held the room for me. I was supposed to deal with this at 8.30 in the morning?The hotel is stunning, the decor is great and the location is perfect . The bar is very cool - so retro! They started selling Meantime beer from Greenwich which is a real find. The restaurant (not that we went this time) is very good italian, with a great wine list. The view was excellent from the roof terrace.When I looked at the bill and saw GBP800 for the three night stay, I started asking myself whether it was really worth it. On this occasion, I don't think it was. I don't think I will be returning to the Zetter to stay. Hopefully someone from The Zetter will look at this review and do something about the service. With so many gushing reviews on tripadvisor, maybe it was me? Genuinely I feel that there is much room for improvement."
82,1282,"Jun 9 2007	For an American audience	This was my second stay at the Zetter. If you have a lot of energy or a few extra minutes, you could check out my previous review. In short, I am still very impressed with the hotel and even more impressed with the surrounding area. But if you are American (as am I), I wouldn't get too caught up in the rave reviews by British tourists. On the whole, hotels in London are lousy with respect to value compared to other European capitals and especially compared to the U.S., and you will be disappointed if you expect the Zetter to be on par with similarly priced modern/ trendy hotels in the U.S.. The dollar is very weak compared to the pound, and unlike the restaurant scene the hotel choices in London have not really improved much in the past 20 years. The rooms are small but well designed. Housekeeping is flawless, the staff is great, and the bartenders are simultaneously good-looking, engaging, and make great Mojitos. The biggest asset of the hotel is the surrounding area. You will feel that you are in the &quot;real&quot; London...hip, safe, exciting, and as convenient as anywhere else for sight-seeing but without the tourist hordes. Just keep in mind....for London (but not the U.S.), the Zetter is a really good value."
83,1282,"May 31 2007	it's the best in the land!	Some live in a house, some live in a flat, some live on a boat, but I on the other hand, until a few months ago, lived in a hotel! Not just any hotel, rather a restaurant with rooms, which in reality doesnt sound as seedy as one might assume. Housed in the old pool rooms on Clerkenwell road, The Zetter is more like the loft apartment you always dreamt of owning rather than a room to rent. Great management, staff who go over and above the call of duty, a restaurant serving home cooked Italian food that gives Elizabeth David a run for her money. What more could a 30 something girl in the city ask for?"
84,1282,"May 8 2007 	Zetter the coolest hotel in town	What a wonderful experience staying in the Zetter was........ From the moment I arrived the reception I felt special and very modern. The rooms are just fab, I just love the pink lights, choice of music and all the quirky extras that are dotted around the rooms, very original. I also really appreciated the local information that was in the room for the guests, not only interesting but very useful The convenience of the vending machines on each floor is a brilliant idea, how many times have I forgotten that vital essential, and there they all were, not to mention the naughty treats, vodka redbull and chocolate yum yum!I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, again, service and food was just wonderful. The menu had that &quot;special something&quot; which made the meals just irresistible. Would I come and stay again.........absolutely would recommend to everyone!"
85,1282,"Apr 30 2007 	Greatest Cocktails on Earth!	My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our engagement in London in style and after searching the found The Zetter to be recommended as stylish, modern and funky. We were not dissapointed - the staff could not have been kinder (and that was before they knew why we were there) - the rooms were really cool, with great quirky bits like pink lighting, rain showers and the comfiest pillows ever - but the best part for me were the cocktails. AMAZING. We had a great weekend and would definately, definitely go back."
86,1282,"Apr 11 2007 	I love this hotel	The only problem with this hotel, is that it such a short stay!Not many londoners are aware of this trendy area, let alone this little hotel. The area is amougst cafes, bars, restaurants and iconic nightclubs, I say pah to the west end.You must visit the Zetter. They have these cool pink lights all over the hotel and grab a cocktail from the bar, the waiters are all beautiful."
87,1282,"Apr 10 2007 	Stylish but compact	The Zetter pitches itself as &quot;restaurant &amp; rooms&quot;, and it was the restaurant which drew me to it as I was attending a business dinner in one of its private dining rooms, and decided it would be the most convenient place to stay afterwards. It's convenient for Farringdon stationThe standard guest room I was staying in was smartly decorated, with some attention to detail. Although a double room, I think it would have felt cramped with two guests in it. There was no wardrobe, only a suitcase stand and a couple of coathooks - not a problem for me, but I would have expected at least some clothes storage space.The bed was comfortable, and the secondary glazing kept out most of the noise from Clerkenwell Road. There were also folding shutters to keep out most of the light. The rooms are however arranged around an atrium, which means there is likely to be some noise from the bar on the ground floor (or from guests on other floors).The room comes with a PC which provides the audio-visual entertainment through the tv - it plays DVDs, and includes an MP3 &quot;jukebox&quot; with a good (and free) selection of albums. The fan in the PC was noisy though. The wifi in the hotel is now free, but irritatingly if you want to access the internet using the PC keyboard it costs 10. There's no minibar fridge in the room, but there is a selection of non-refrigerated drinks and snacks, at the usual eye-watering prices (other than the bottles of water, which are free). (Note that there is a late night supermarket two doors down the street!).The shower room (note there is no bath tub) was relatively spacious. Bathrobes provided, but 2 a pop if you want to use the shaving or toothbrush kits. The shower has a large shower head, though (if you're bothered about such things) the spray wasn't particularly powerful or adjustable.The room was clean and well-maintained, other than a slightly faulty shutter and the sliding bathroom door being very squeaky and not locking. Overall, I would recommend it, but be wary of the potential noise from the atrium."
88,1282,"Apr 3 2007 	Absolutely fabulous!!!	This is the type of hotel you have to stay in before you die!This was our second visit and hopefully not our last. We stayed in a top floor room with patio and city views and it is well worth the money. The decor is chic with litle extras such as throws, hot water bottle, books to read in the loo, neon dog(!) and excellent music through the TV which kept my husband entertained and very jealous!The cocktails down in the bar are perfect and moreish, the staff always polite.The room was large and comfortable, the bed as good as my own and the shower washes away any trace of a hangover in the morning. We truely did not want to leave and hope to return soon. If you're looking for somewhere special this is it."
89,1282,"Mar 19 2007 	A Mod Good Time	My girlfriend and I stayed at The Zetter and Rooms recently during a six day business trip. It was our first stay at the hotel and in the Clerkenwell area. In short, the stay was exceptional. However, when we arrived, we discovered (much to our chagrin) that the hotel could not honor our reservation for a Rooftop Suite because of a mixup. We thought, &quot;Oh no, this is not good.&quot;. But the staff was apologetic and we were offered a smaller St. John's Square room for two nights until the mixup was fixed. The staff threw in a few perks, including a complimentary bottle of champagne and two days of breakfast at no additional charge. The restaurant is outstanding. The decor of the hotel is mod and tres cool. The staff is smiley and friendly. And once we were moved to the larger Rooftop Suite, it was dreamy. It had a balcony and immense space for a London hotel room. It exceeded our expectations in terms of amenties and decor. Granted, it's not cheap. But in the end, this is a very unusual, quirky, and delightful hotel and restaurant."
90,1282,"Mar 12 2007 	Pretty cool!!	My partner and I were in London for the weekend to see a show. Having previously lived in London I was looking for something a bit different - away from the tourist trail but near enough to get about on foot.The Zetter certainly delivered.Although the room was quite small, it was imaginitively decorated and the designer touches (such as neon pink light and knitted hot water bottle cover) really made the difference.The other great (due to it being surprisingly different than most other hotels) thing was the music library, free magazines and bottles of still and sparkling water provided free of charge and topped up every day.The other jewel in the crown was breakfast - very good menu with loads of choice - and good value if you get a weekend deal.I'd really recommend this to anyone who is looking for something off the tourist trail - a stylish, comfortable, cool hotel."
91,1282,"Feb 23 2007	hotel with heart in a great part of London	This is going to sound indulgent. I live in London but a couple of weekends ago stayed at The Zetter in Clerkenwell. Not my usual habit to stay at hotels in my own city... however, a friend and I were discussing the fact that you get such a different experience of a place if you're in the position of a tourist, and then got thinking how nice it would be to go away in London and just kick back and not worry about the washing up etc. We both love clekenwell (great restaurants) and had heard about The Zetter through various bits in the press. So away we went. After having a little trouble finding the entrance (we were round the side of the building), we found ourselves in the reception area, next to a cabinet full of curios and quirky craft-pieces. First indication this is not your usual corporate hotel. A striving to be individual is felt everywhere. Though the hotel's nearish to the city, it's collaborated with lots of local design businesses so you do get that village feel. There were some lamps in our room from a Clekenwell design company and our little knitted hotwater bottles - much needed since snow fell the following day - were also from a local crafts association, I think.Room was lovely. Not huge - in fact on the small side - but the use of space was very clever and we never felt squashed in. Lots of great touches, from the drinking water that comes from the wells of Clerkenwell (took me ages to twig that), to the thoughtful selection of magazines. Not forgetting the English heritage cum minimalist cum 1970's design. Sounds like it would never work, but believe me, it does. Fantastic views over london even though the weather was grim (i've attached a pic of the view from the room). We were lucky enough to be on the 5th floor and have our own balcony.The Zetter has a restaurant, too. We didn't sit down at a table but had some tapas at the bar. Had some really good blinis and charcuterie, along with some rabbit with chestnut pasta. The cocktails have to be tried. Service not at all formal but everyone was very friendly and helpful in a laid back way. All I would say is that if you want to be based in the west end, The Zetter isn't right in the middle of it. But it's only 10ish minutes walk to Covent Garden. I think Clerkenwell's so much nicer, though, so try something a bit different!"
92,1282,"Feb 13 2007	Coffee point?	Stayed at the Zetter for a birthday treat. The rooms are great. Lovely large beds and goose down duvet covers and massive showers. The in room entertainment systems is fantastic as is the subtle lighting. The shower is also impressive in size but doesn't blast you away as you might expect. The hotel falls down on to fronts. Firstly breakast isn't included, and for this price it wouldn't. Secondly there are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms. You have to utilise the drinks station outside in the coridoor which while not the end of the world does mean having to dress to make yourself half decent. Minor points which if improved would make this fab place even better. (and if they updated the music system with new tunes too!)"
93,1282,"Jan 22 2007	Restaurant/ Front Desk Staff Were Appalling In Emergency	This is not a review of the hotel facilities, which look lovely. In fact, I had tentative plans to go back with my girlfriend this spring to stay, but have no such intentions any more. On the evening of Sunday, November 19, 2006, our family ate at the restaurant (upon my recommendation, following very positive Guardian reviews). We had all recently arrived from outside the country, including my parents who had travelled to London from North America to meet us. To make a very long story short, the service, which began as standoffish and snobby and best, degraded to downright negligent during the course of a local power outage which saw the dining room go virtually pitch-black (where was the emergency lighting?) whereupon my mothers handbag, including passport, cash, cards, digital camera, etc. (valued in excess of 1000) disappeared from the back of her chair. Health &amp; Safety policy? Moral obligation? Potential culpability? Leadership under duress? Ha. The staff seemed not to care whatsoever, although they were otherwise able to tally our bill by hand. The kitchen was closed out of necessity, but they kept serving drinks in the dark. No one did anything to help, until they were forcefully pressed at the front desk to contact the police on our behalf.We were one of maybe five occupied tables in the very large dining room that night. There was a CCTV camera pointed right in our direction. No one would or ever did pull the tape, despite requests.My mother was in tears most the night. She was then stranded in London for the rest of the week without a passport, unable to board her intended flight. (It had to rebooked three times). I could go on..."
94,1282,"Dec 22 2006	Lovely neighborhood lovely hotel	Really nice boutique hotel. Big rooms, comfy bed. In addition- there is a coffee station on each floor that makes fresh coffe/expresso/cappucino by the cup. Free wireless internet. Plus, they have 2 different kinds of water by the liter - still and bubbly. It is free and it is refreshed daily. Seems small, but when you are walking all over the city, this is an extra nice perk."
95,1282,"Dec 13 2006 	Wanted to love it...	I wanted to love this hotel, really. The room decor is adorable and larger than most boutique hotels. The indirect (overhead red/white dial) lighting is fun and creates a good ambiance in the room. The bathroom fixtures and &quot;rain&quot; shower and toiletries are fantastic. The hotel is only a short walk from the tube.But, the service (or lack thereof) killed everything. The front desk was rude and condescending. They hassled me for wanting a non-smoking room, made me feel &quot;difficult&quot; for asking for one, tried their hardest not to give me one...and then, surprise, one magically appeared! When you return for the night, no one greets you or makes you feel welcome. And they were equally cold and aloof when I checked out as well. I love boutique hotels and have stayed in many in London. I get excited for each new one to try. I can't tell you what a disappointment it was to be treated so rudely when everything else was so perfect and would have had me raving about The Zetter."
96,1282,"Dec 12 2006 	The Faultless Zetter	My mum and I stayed at The zetter for 2 nights on the 8th of December for a weekend of Christmas shopping. The hotel allowed us to book in early and the staff were happy, obliging, helpful and made you feel looked after and were very attentive without being in your face. We stayed in St Johns room superior, which was lovely, not overly large but perfectly formed and the touches of the hot water bottle, endless free tunes and the big shower were once again faultless.We ate in the hotel the first night, we didn't book and the restaurant was heaving but they got us in as we were staying in the hotel (perks that are normally forgotten in todays slack customer service regimes). The food and cocktails, service and atmosphere was great, PLEASE try the vodka and espresso martini, velvet to the lips and ended up being a staple end to our evenings as we chilled in the stylish lounge before stumbling up to bed. The next night we ate at Smiths a restaurant under 5 mins walk away which was once again amazing. It is four floors with a cocktail bar, everything u need under one roof.I would definitely go back to The Zetter time and time again, it was so refreshing to get decent service and excellent value for money in stylish and faultless surroundings. A top weekend."
97,1282,"Nov 3 2006 	I want to live here!	This was my second stay at the zetter and it is the only place in London I would want to stay. I normally stay with friends but from now on I will shell out the extra cash for the experience of staying here. I have stayed in a couple of supposedly luxury hotels which have nothing on this little gem. The design is fantastic, the staff are friendly and the area is great. Only slight problem is noise - I did have some difficulty getting off to sleep as for some reason noise really seems to travel.For London this hotel is serioulsy good value and I would highly recommend it - and if you do stay here you must book into Moro just 10 mins walk away."
98,1282,"Aug 15 2006	Wow!	Fantastic place! We had the second size room up. Fantstic decor, lovely bathroom. I have since read all the paint is eco friendly. Didn't eat in the restaurant but in retrospect would have been nice. The next morning we walked past Moro restaurant which is just around the corner - definately wish we had eaten there! Breakfast is WAY too expensive but will stay in the hotel again."
99,1282,"Aug 7 2006	Finally a design hotel that doesn't cost the earth!	I have just returned from a birthday mini-break in London organised by my husband at a place called The Zetter. We had such a good time that I felt compelled to write a review - especially as I am usually quite a fussy customer.It is hard to say what's so good about the Zetter - it is a combination of things. It is really beautifully done up in designer-style, but without being at all pretentious or intimidating. In fact it seems to have a bit of a sense of humour with really nice quirky individual touches like pink mood lighting and matching woolly hot water bottles and blankets in the bedrooms, and huge great big coloured swirls hand-painted on the restaurant walls. The staff there are really friendly too, but not at all in that slightly false 'looking for a tip' way - just relaxed, yet smiley and approachable. The facilities at the hotel are definitley enough to keep both sides of a marriage happy - there's the amazing interactive TV system to keep the boys busy for at least a couple of hours, and lovely oversized dressing gowns, luxury toiletries and huge power showers to keep the girls feeling pampered and happy. The rooms are a little on the small side perhaps, but for the price (approx 140 pounds a night) still great value for money considering this is one of London's trendiest neighbourhoods we're talking about.We really enjoyed exploring the local area following the recommendations of our interactive TV's 'out &amp; about' guide. There are loads of great galleries, bars, clubs and restaurants all on your doorstep, but be warned it's hard to fit them all in when you've also got to make time for the simply delicious 'modern Mediterranean' cooking on offer in the Zetter Restaurant. It's really tasty fare, and a definitely a notch above the usual standards of a hotel restaurant. I think I'll be demanding a return trip next birthday!All in all a fantastic experience, and one which I'd highly recommend."
100,1282,"Aug 2 2006 	Plenty of Charm 	This hotel has plenty of energy and charm.The staff through to the vending machines and help-yourself coffee make this little place a new generation of quirky, afforable hotels.Felt like I was chilling out in my own lounge drinking cocktails in the retro atrium lounge... Very cool..Even saw a few 'b' list celebs hanging in the bar!"
101,1282,"Jul 22 2006 	Very Hip hotel	Stayed at the Zetter for a one night stay prior to our return to the States. Hotel had been recommended by a few travel blogs as hip and trendy. Booked room 507 ( top floor studio with outside patio ) Room very pink!!! (mood lights).We had just stayed at the Savoy on the front end of our Europe trip - so a comparison would not be fair. The plus side - great funky location, walking to the Old Bailey, lots of city vibe (even for a Sunday) Great service from reception. Room was on the large (for London) side. Great water pressure. The Media Center TV is a great plus.So so - it's just not a 5 star experience (although at 293 you would expect it - the price is only a few pounds shy of the Savoy). BUT, the hotel is not close to anything touristy- expect to walk. The front reception is just cramped, there are two elevators (small at that) and there is not way for the staff to know when you arrive that luggage assitance may or may not be needed. The Zetter is an environmentally friendly hotel, thus, you need to keep your hotel key inserted in the slot by the AC to keep it operating ( never hovered below 19 dec C ) - it was over 90 degrees the day we visited the Zetter, needless to say - keep the extra key inserted so the room stays cool!It good hotel - not great - the staff does try its best under the circumstances.."
102,1282,"Jul 21 2006 	A Gem of a Hotel	The Zetter Hotel does several things right. I was hard pressed to find something wrong!To start, the restaurant is amazing. Mediterranian cuisene done very very well. Lots of amazing fish dishes, scallops, shrimps, etc. I ate there twice during my stay and each time was quite a treat. Be SURE to order a &quot;Make Me Happy&quot; martini from the bar. The Tropicana and the Citrus were also excellent. Cheers to the inventor of the anything but standard Martini list. The staff of the property was so courteous, friendly and helpful. Being from the states, I initially felt lost in the city. But the staff was so helpful pointing out must see sightseeing areas, tube stations, and even hooked me up at a nearby club on Saturday night. They really helped make otherwise difficult navigation easy.The rooms are very well appointed. Comfortable bed, amazing bathroom &amp; shower, even a free cauppucino each morning! Makes the complimentary coffee in America look a bit weak if you ask me! I really liked their energy concious attitude. In order to get the power turned on in the room, you have to put your key in a little slot just inside the door. That way, you don't accidentally leave the AC on when you leave, wasting money and energy.Probably the most unique thing I came across was the bottled water. They make their own! Apparently they have a full water processing plant in the basement and tap into &quot;Clerks Well&quot; thousands of feet below the hotel. The water was as good if not better than Fiji (my personal favorite)If you are looking for a small hotel where everyone knows your name, think the Zetter! Far less pretentious and &quot;trendy&quot; than St. Martens Lane or the Sanderston. This place gets it right! If you're lucky enough to book a room with a terrace, you'll fall in love immediately!"
103,1282,"Jul 7 2006	The Zetter worked for us!	My mother and I stayed at the Zetter for 8 nights in mid-June and we LOVED it! It is not for everyone; you have to appreciate the fun and funky style and be prepared for smaller rooms (typical for London) and a location that is not central. However, as we were repeat visitors to London (and not there to sightsee), we found the nearby tube station quite convenient and also chose to walk to our destinations. The area has an amazing number of incredible restaurants--but beware of Sunday when most are closed--and the Zetter's breakfasts were invariably yummy. We enjoyed the hallway coffee machine and its variety of fresh offerings, the rooms were very comfortable and decor throughout the hotel was stylish and fuctional. The staff? Helpful and friendly-- we felt like we were saying goodbye to family when it was time to go."
104,1282,"Jul 3 2006	Good restaurant quirky hotel!!!	Stayed at the zetter on the 24th of june. A really great looking hotel and with a lovely restaurant. Lots of quirky aspects to the hotel (pink lighting, the zzzzz menu, recent life size portrait of Gordon Banks in hotel bar). Unfortnetly my key card failed four times, including when I arrived back inebriated in the early hours of the morning, which led to a rather uncomfortable night sleep on the hallway floor. I had other issues with build quality but hey I dont want to bore you.Good fun, reasonable value, would not return, pay the extra and try the sanderson, the metropolitan, etc..."
105,1282,"May 26 2006	Funky Hotel in Funky Location!	From the moment we walked into the Zetter Hotel, I could give it nothing but 5 stars!The reception staff were helpful and friendly and as I have never been to this part of town before (clerkenwell), they recommended some great bars i.e vinoteca &amp; clubs in the area to visit.Rooms are funky &amp; modern, but also comfortable, especially the beds... My husband loved the music libary, 4000 tracks to choose from, free of charge!The vegetarian breakfast was delicious and serivce was prompt &amp; with a smile. The Bar tender that made my mouth-watering cocktail, a Smithfield Pony, the night before was a gem.. There were too many decisions on the list and made-up one especially for me!We wished we could of stayed another night but the Zetter was fullly booked. I can understand why! Very impressed with the hotel, I'm suprised more people do not know about this Chic Clerkenwell Hotel. We'll be passing the good word on"
106,1282,"May 20 2006 	A triumph of style over substance	I stayed for one night at this hotel, and would rate it as the worst nights sleep I have ever had.The appearance of the room was great - contemporary styling, comfortable looking bed, wonderful film library and sound system in your room. But that was where it ended. The Zetter is in an old building, on a busy road. I think it must be near a hospital as there were a lot of sirens during the night, which is unusual in London. The windows are single glazed, so from a noise viewpoint it felt like I was sleeping out in the road. There are no curtains, but shutters inside the windows. And they don't fit. So by the time I had dug in my bag to find earplugs and finally got to sleep at 3.30 I was woken only a couple of hours later by the light shining through the gaps.The bed in my 195 per night was small. It was fine for me, but I would not have wanted to share it.There was no light in the shower (needed when it is made of dark tiles), and no light suitable for make up in the bathroom. I eventually coped by shining the desk light onto the mirror in the room.On reading the room guide it said that earplugs were available at reception.....but who wants to go to reception in the middle of the night. I have no idea why they do not place them in the room. The guide also told of the tea and coffee machine on each floor. On investigation, it was a superb machine....but again who wants to go out of their room to get tea or coffee.On the upside, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the restaurant was good, hence a rating of 2 rather than 1."
107,1282,"May 8 2006	Service Makes Location Not Worth It	The hotel room was as expected- hip and modern. The attached restaurant was very good, with a great all-glass view of the neighborhood. Now the negative- The bar is in a strange location and not conducive to chillin, with inconsistent service (e.g. wrong drinks, no memory of previous drink). The hotel service was also disappointing. For example, when we called to order room service, after much thought, it turned out the menu was out-of-date. Our items were no longer on the menu. No one told us anything about the area or introduced the room when we checked in- with the desk being somewhat cold. Items were missing from the room, so we had to call for them. Finally, the hotel is really too far if you are in town to see the sights. Though the tube can get you anywhere, the station is a bit of a hop. With better service- the location may have been worth it."
108,1282,"Apr 19 2006	Funky Chilled	My girlfriend and I (24 &amp; 27yrs old) stayed at the Zetter for one night over the Easter Bank holiday. I paid 160 for St John's Sq room which on reflection I thought was slightly overpriced.The room had a comfortable amount of space with a roomy bathroom, everything was very clean and tidy as you would expect. The shower was really nice probably the best feature in all honesty. One tip is to turn off the computer that controls the TV etc at night otherwise you will find yourself being woken up by the cooling system on it! Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't eat in the hotel but did find a very nice restaurant further up Farringdon Rd on the right hand side of the entrance to Exmouth Market.We did have cocktails in the bar which were excellent! All in all it's a nice hotel in a cool part of London and close to a number of tubes. If you want a chilled funky hotel then this could be the place for you!"
109,1282,"Apr 19 2006	Nice but not that impressed........	Stayed at the Zetter with my husband for one night during Easter weekend. The hotel was really nice but nothing special. The room (we stayed in a suite on the top floor) was pleasant, nicely decorated, good size for London (which means small if you are staying anywhere else in the world, including New York), bathroom was nice as well (really good shower but the bath itself on the small side). We had a small roof terrace with the so called city views (yes we could see few buildings from there, but it was not anything spectacular)Basically even though overall it was a really nice hotel I would not really stay there again unless for business and paid by the company. There there was no WOW factor like you get with hotels in this pirce bracket (we paid around 300 for one night!!!)We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but had room service which was good food but a bit overpricedLocation is fine if you dont mind travelling by tube to all the touristy spots!"
110,1282,"Apr 16 2006 	Just OK	Stayed for two nights in April. On the good side: a fantastic shower, decent sized room and a cool location. On the bad side: Crap food, lots of street noise, inattentive (bordering on incompetant) staff and a TV that broke twice. I'm sure there are better places in the neighborhood."
111,1282,"Mar 22 2006 	Hip and trendy area of London	I stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel room was nice i stayed in a St Johns Square room which was a large room with a comfortable bed. Nicely decorated and quiet room. Nice lounge in lobby to have a drink after work. Staff was helpful and kind. Clerkenwell have many good restaurants and bars. I ate at Portal and St Johns both good and had a glas of wine and cheese at the Enoteca on St Johns street which all were good. If you are a tourist and wants to do sightseeing this is not the area to stay in but if you have been to London many times and just want to meet with friends, eat at nice restaurants and bars this is the hotel to stay in. /Stefan"
112,1282,"Mar 6 2006	Weekend Retreat!	Have just spend a grown up long weekend at The Zetter escaping from our two toddlers!I travel and stay in London regularly and so wanted to find a special hotel that would feel very different to work so spent a great deal of time on tinternet trying to find one - I was not disappointed.From the booking process to the moment we left, the staff did all they could to provide a great experience. The hotel is small and non the worse for that. I would describe it as funky chic with some great design touches like the atrium and bar. The room (a corner king) was an excellent size for central london with a small bathroom (but sensational shower). Again, the little touches like complimentary own source water and knitted hot water bottle make the difference. The breakfast is excellent - always freshly prepared and some interesting options (although the English breakfast should not be overlooked and kept me going all the way back to Leeds that evening!).Whilst the Zetter is certainly not cheap it is affordable luxury and is certainly somewhere that I would recomend to anyone looking for a bit of urban cool."
113,1282,"Mar 5 2006 	Great value!	I stayed here 4 nights for a business trip. Although the room was a bit small and the bed was only a twin I was satisfied with the price of the room (GBP140 + VAT), especially since most hotels will charge a lot more.The bathroom and shower stall was good-sized, they event had Elemis shampoo, conditioner and shower gel! I ordered room service for breakfast, lunch and dinner during the week and was delighted to discover that they delivered the meal within 15 minutes each time! That's better service than most hotels in Asia, Australia and the United States!!The staff at the reception was friendly, check-in service was speedy and although my room card key failed to work twice during the week they replaced my card key immediately.Clerkenwell is very close to the City of London so if you're meeting people in the &quot;City&quot; you're only a 5 - 10 minute walk away. If you're planning to do some shopping on Oxford Street or Knightsbridge (like me) then Farringdon tube is only a 5 minute walk away. However, compared to when I lived in London 10 years ago the price of transportation (taxi and tube) has really gone up! There's a news agent right across the street from the hotel - it's great if you need to get the latest magazines and news. There are restaurants w/i walking distance (a noodle shop and cafes within a 30 second walk from the hotel).I would definitely stay hear again."
114,1282,Mar 2 2006	Very hip	Nice hotel and the price isn't bad. I am not sure that it is better than the Malmaison just down the road though. The cd jukebox feature on your TV is a nice touch but the &quot;glow lamp&quot; (or whatever it is called) next to my bed required to be switched off so that I could get some sleep without seeing various colours projected across the room! Very hip and great decor The mini bar is a vending machine in the hall-way but this was not a negative for me.
115,1282,"Feb 19 2006	Absolutely fantastic - would definately recommend!	I arranged a mid range room for my boyfriend's birthday and upon booking under the &quot;special requests&quot;, I asked if it would be possible to either upgrade us or just make it a little bit special for him.Upon arrival, the reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The receptionist had said that she noticed my request and had upgraded us to the top floor suite. (Excellent!)The room was really nice. Well laid out, a nice terrace with spectacular view and a nice sized bathroom. The shower was a rain dance shower and I didn't want to get out! The bed was comfy, hot water bottle - nice touch although not needed! The room had air con settings which was nice and there were nice quirky extras such as Time Out, books and other magazines.I do think that if you are paying for this room it isn't &quot;value for money&quot; and it made it that much better to know we had been upgraded complimentary. The breakfast was extremely expensive. 3 people = 50+.One slice of toast = 2.50!Although the staff were very friendly though.All in all a wonderful experience and we would definately recommend it and go back."
116,1282,"Feb 2 2006	Zetter Rocks!	Can't say enough good things about our experience at the Zetter Hotel. We stayed four nights and loved it. It is within a few blocks of the Farringdon Tube stop, which is convenient. We arrived at the hotel at 9am on Sunday morning after an overnight plane trip from the US. The reception was incredibly warm and friendly and they did not even question that we wouldn't be checking into our room right away. The woman at the front desk said that there was a room ready right away but it was on the streetside. She suggested that we wait about 1/2 hour for a room on the quieter side of the hotel to be ready as we were going to be there for four nights. So, we had a great breakfast in the hotel restaurant and our room was ready. The room was great! It is small, but that was to be expected in London. The bathroom, however, was quite large, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Maid service went out of their way to accommodate us with cleaning times and always did an excellent job. The hotel restaurant was the best food and atmosphere of our visit and the staff, again, was so welcoming and helpful. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and would definitely go back."
117,1282,"Jan 27 2006	Pretty in Pink	We had a short but fabulous time in this gem of a hotel. I booked a 2 night w/e stay on their great website for my wife's birthday and they didn't disappoint. From the Staff's great attitude (endlessly helpful, all smiles, no over-formalities)to the quirky but really well judged decor the place was a winner. Our Top floor room had a big patio, with great views. Highlight: Cooked breakfast in bed listening to Neil Young (one of their thousands of free music tracks on the fancy TV system). The local area is also great at weekends (though you might not think so at first reckoning), a short walk to St Pauls, and on over the amazing Millenium bridge to the Tate Modern on Saturday and then Columbia Road flower market and Spitalfields (another great market with lots going around it) on Sunday. Cannot wait for another excuse to go!Oh and their rooms have groovy porno-pink coloured lighting, good for getting in the mood if you need to, (hence pretty in pink title)"
118,1282,"Jan 25 2006	Great Stay at a Hip Hotel	My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Zetter, including New Years Eve, and loved it. We were in a St. John's Square Superior Room and found it to be plenty large enough and in great shape. Here are a couple standout tidbits we liked. - AMAZING rain-style shower - great music selection on the interactive TV system - red mood lighting, if you want it - hot water bottle - discounted rates on weekends which include free internet access (normally 10 pounds a day) - vending machines have gin and tonics, champagne, rum and cokes, etc - 5 minutes from Farringdon Underground station - great clubs nearby - hip decor, with a 5 story atrium. guests exit their room and can look down into the loungeOne of the best things about that place, was the Texaco station next door where we could get our fill of Nestle's Kit Kat Chunky. Trust me, fellow Americans, you have not tasted chocolate till you try a regular, everyday candybar in Europe. You will never look at our waxy American stuff the same."
119,1282,"Dec 19 2005	If you stay at the Zetter stay at the back	Nicely designed rooms, poor room maintenance (the usual lack of attention to detail I've come to expect from even some of the best hotels - scuff marks, stains on carpets and furnishings, non-functioning heating and a noisy VCD deck) but good service and breakfast. Shame the owners of the Zetter were too cheap to double glaze the windows and think that their poorly designed shutters will keep out the traffic noise. Ask for rooms at the back, away from Clerkwenwell Road and St John's Square. If you don't like noise and you can't get these rooms, stay at the Covent Garden Hotel instead."
120,1282,"Dec 7 2005	Gorgeous Hotel would definitely go back	My boyfriend and I stayed here at the end of November for our first anniversary. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't be very romantic as a few of the pictures on the internet look quite stark, but it was very cosy and you could change the lighting which was very cool. We stayed in a standard room the first night and a suite the second night. The beds in both rooms were the most comfortable we've ever slept in. I think it's a shame that they only had tea and coffee in the suite. The standard room had an excellent shower, but no bath. The suite had a bath, but the shower wasn't great. Also in the suite you could pipe music or the T.V into the bathroom. There was a huge balcony/terrace, but unfortunately it was too cold to sit out on it.The staff were really friendly and helpful.We would love to go back!"
121,1282,"Nov 28 2005	Style comes with a price and The Zetter is cheap!	I recently visited The Zetter Hotel for two days. The hotel is located at the fashionable district of Clenkerwell which, in fact, is NOT near any of the attractions of London. The tube is conveniently located a few blocks away, although, in the middle of the night, the streets surrounding the area are empty and look a bit creepy. The lobby of the Zetter is nothing special and is small. We were kindly walked to our rooms. The space is very reduced and even the elevator is tiny. Decoration is rather claustrophobic (red carpet in the stairs, black elevator etc.). Our rooms (214 and 314) were very, very small. Even by European standards (and I am European), those rooms were tiny! We could hardly walk around the bed and the closet was minuscule. There is a desk full of things (the minibar is basically set up on it!) and there is hardly space to work. The TV is hanging on the wall and is flat. The screen is no more than 15 inches. Since the TV is powered through a computer it can be rather noisy at night and we had to disconnect the whole thing. The bed was extremely comfortable and clean, all in white. There are at least 8 switches to control the illumination at the room, some of which are useless (unless you want to have --- all night! -red light, for example-). The hot water bag is not a nice detail... (I would not put my feet on a bag that 200 people have used before me). The bathroom was very clean although was lacking in bathroom amenities (no hand soap, for example). Again, it was tiny. Check in and check out was without any remarkable problems.The best touch? A cappuccino machine at the entrance of the room. Very nice detail indeed! I would recommend this hotel to people that have been to London before and want a clean hotel without spending a fortune and that understand that the price comes with the inconvenience of location. Compared to other design hotels (Sanderson, Saint Martin's Lane), I think this hotel lacks lots of things and overdoes some others (lighting for example)."
122,1282,"Nov 28 2005 	Can't say enough good things about the Zetter	A funky, hip place that is a refreshing change from the usual stodgy London hotels. My room was small but clean and comfortable with a good view. I loved the in-room music selection as well as the modern bathroom and ultra-cool shower (possibly the best I've ever experienced). The restaurant is good but a bit overpriced for what you get -- there are a number of alternatives nearby. Staff will store your luggage for the day. The hotel is a short walk from the nearest tube station. I will definitely stay here again."
123,1282,"Nov 22 2005	A lovely night in a lovely hotel!	I spent a long time trying to find a London hotel to spend a romantic night with my girlfriend. We were booked into a standard room at the K-West but after reading some of the tripadvisor reviews I changed my mind. I also phoned K-West and was less than impressed with the attitude of the receptionist.My girlfriend came across The Zetter while searching for a restaurant to host her christmas party so I looked at the reviews and took a glance at the website. The place looked perfect so I called to make a booking. The lady I spoke to was very friendly and told me there were only a few remaining rooms, one that looks onto St. John's square and a Deluxe Studio, the best room in the hotel. I went for the studio!We arrived at the hotel around 2:30pm, check-in was 2pm but the room was still not ready so the staff were very apologetic and we were offered complientary drinks at the bar. I must add, the restaurant, bar and staff are lovely. 15 minutes later, we were handed to key to room 503 and up we went. The room is quite small compared to similarly priced European hotels, as we expected. It is split into two levels with wardrobe, bathroom and front door on the lower level as you walk in and bed on the top level. The far wall is all glass, looking onto the large balcony with nice views over the surrounding city. Very romantic. As advertised, there are thousands of songs which can be played through the TV and piped into the bathroom. A range of films are available, 4 of which are free at weekends. You are also provided with a DVD player and internet. The bed is very comfortable, it is also a 'Freshbed'! I believe this regulates the temperature of your bed, keeping you comfortable all night long.we ordered dinner and breakfast through roomservice, both reasonably priced and delicious! The service was prompt and polite. I really couldn't fault the staff one bit!The only problem we found was that the bath plug did not seal properly so we could not run a bath without the water running out. However, as a result, we were not charged for any of the mini-bar.We left the hotel feeling refreshed, relaxed and very happy! We will be returning to The Zetter."
124,1282,"Nov 8 2005	Hip but cosy	I stayed here with my boyfriend one Friday and we loved it. Let's start with the bar. It was small but relaxed and not at all busy for 8pm on a Friday night considering the area. The room, again was small but perfectly formed with a fantastic selection of free music to listen to and the beds there are amazing. The staff are attentive and friendly. We needed painkillers for our heads in the morning and room service were happy to oblige us by running to the local petrol station (which incidentally is 5 mins walk and equipped with most essentials). We had breakfast in the morning and I recommend the full english (for him) and the scrambled eggs (for her). It wasn't that cheap at 15 for the full works but it was extremely filling. When the guy calculated the wrong amount for breakfast and we queried it, he happily, and without fuss, removed the offending amount and even knocked a bit extra off (he charged us for a small pot of tea instead of a large). There are some excellent bars in the vicinity and some of the best clubs in London. This is a great value hotel in an excellent location. Enjoy your stay."
125,1282,"Oct 19 2005 	A Ninja Stole My Wife	Stayed three nights in October in a 4th Floor St John's Square Room.The Gatwick connection to Farringdon via Thames Link trains is excellent. The hotel is then a 5-minute walk once you exit the tube station.Arriving around 10am, I was able to check in early and start enjoying the room and hotel. First off, the bed: King size, firm and equipped with super soft and cosy bedlinen and 4 crisp, luxurious pillows.A generous amount of natural light was supplied by the large windows overlooking the square (two of which could easily be opened). Artifical lighting could be altered to create different atmospheres - including a soft rosy glow effect.The working space was on the minimal side - the desk arranged for this purpose having to compete with drinks, snacks and various papers.Storage was also slightly inconvenient and I could have used more space.As has been said before, the shower is heavenly. The cocktails also: particularly recommend: &quot;Last Night a Ninja Stole my Wife&quot;.Service-wise, I felt that the front desk was competent and friendly but perhaps lacking experience.Overall, I would rate my stay as extremely positive and would not hesitate to stay here again."
126,1282,Oct 2 2005	The Lovely Zetter	Had a great stay at this hotel. Very near to two clubs Fabric and Turnmills. Very new and modern. Made a change from the normal snobby second rate hotels.Loved it
127,1282,"Sep 13 2005	The best shower in London!	I stayed at the Zetter recently (I normally stay at Sanderson). I thought it was fantastic. I got a great rate through Tablet Hotels, by the way! They offer great service for the price - the room is limited (no baths) but what they do provide is very good (the best shower in London). The staff were very helpful and great all round."
128,1282,"Aug 8 2005	A great hotel (and I am picky)	I am in London on a regular basis and have stayed in many sorts of hotels. Many are in my opinion overpriced and unattractive. My wife and I stayed at the Zetter for a weekend in July and it was a very pleasant surprise. We got a special rate of 110 for a double room. The hotel is in the buzzing (and now trendy) Clekenwell area which is on the rim of the financial district. There are many bars and restaurants in the area. (Try the top floor of nearby Smiths for an upmarket meal with view over the City). The West end is a ten minute taxi ride away. For shopping in Kings Road, Knihtsbridge etc you are probably looking at twice that (or more?). The tube is nearby (but we avoided it due to the recent bomings). The Zetter is a modern designerhotel. I am not s huge fan of that type of hotel but this really works. Rooms are small but clean and well equipped in terms of pc, internet etc. Nice thick bedlinen, real duvet etc..Really great and proactive service (which is rare in London). Steamiron, adapter, blowdrier...it was all brought quickly when we asked for it. Downstairs there is a bar/restaurant/cafe which is light and spacious. We didnt eat there but we had english breakfast in bed both mornings and it was the best I've ever had. There is no minibar but a well stocked vending machine on each floor as well as an espresso machine/tea maker. I can recommend this for tourists and even for business travellers. Sure beats coughing up &gt;150 for an impersonal hotel machine from the &quot;leading brands&quot;."
129,1282,"Jul 9 2005	great place to stay a bit far from the action	Loved the room, very fun and modern though small, clean and comfortable, asked for a quiet room off the street, fourth floor looking over a small plaza, so quiet i kept my windows open all night and heard nothing. two blocks to a good tube station, only problem was it's not near anything, very dead at night; but only a quick, six pound cab ride from soho or two pounds on the tube."
130,1282,"Jul 5 2005	Funky comfortableRelaxing	I stayed at this hotel for one night on the 2nd of july 05. Booked it as a birthday suprise for my boyfriend the rooms are funky yet very comfortable. The lighting is especially nice and perfect for a romantic weekend away. The area is great just near old street where there are loads of clubs and resturants which are only a bus ride away. I would recommend this to any one, but particulary couples."
131,1282,"Jun 29 2005	Great hotel	Stayed at the Zetter over a weekend. The hotel lobby is small but impressive on entry and check in was swift and our room was ready, even though we arrived a couple of hours before check in. The room was small but very nice. The bed and pillows were the best and it was a shame we were in London to see a gig in Hyde Park and sightseeing, otherwise could've been tempted to stay in bed the whole time. We got a free paper in the morning too.The bathroom was great, though the shower not as powerful as I would've liked. Great free toiletries and fluffy towels. The hairdryer is hidden in the bottom of the wardrobe/hanging space if you start to panic. We had a room on the third floor that overlooked Clerkenwell Road and was not really disturbed by traffic noise.The area is buzzing on a Friday and completely different come Sat/Sun when all the businessmen have gone home. Great bars/cafes etc in local area - really not like being in London.Don't look at a street map like me and think it's not far from St Pancras station - it was a good 1/2 hour walk!"
132,1282,"Jun 16 2005	Fun but with some oddities	I was just at the Zetter on business. Stayed in a standard room on the 4th floor. I recommed a high floor as the noise from the bar can get loud. Thought the room was great, especially the free water as I have stayed at hotels that charge 10 dollars for the water in the room.I booked the spring pamper package at 165/ night. This includes a contintental breakfast, a 30 minute foot massage, a free movie and a free 1 day travelcard. Unfortunately the travelcard was issued for the day I checked in - and I checked in at 10pm - so it was not much use. (Nor would it be to anyone as check in is in the afternoon!!) The movie selection was 4 - and the most recent was Cinema Paradiso - the others being from the 1950s. I didn't choose any.The foot massage rocked and was really an hour so I gave a huge tip. The breakfast is a weird thing. Almost everything on the menu is cheaper than the &quot;continental buffet&quot; - which is pastries and cereal. Order a real breakfast - they are MUCH better!I had breakfast, lunch and dinner there and they were all very nice.The WiFi is a racket though. I walked all over the hotel trying to get a stable connection - which is 15 a day. The problem is, it is actually from 12 pm to 12 am, so if you need to log in in the morning and at night you pay 30!! I complained and said I had even had someone up to my room because the connection was so bad, so they took off the extra 15.Be sure to check your bill. I was charged for breakfast everyday even though it was included in my room rate.The staff are very nice and it is very clean. Great if you need to be in the City area of town. My door had a strange problem that it made a weird clicking noise like someone was trying to open it, every 15 minutes, which made sleeping a bit of a challenge, but I got used to it after a few days.The beds are great. I agree they need bathrobes. Like the nice hot pink indirect lighting and modern decor. All in all, a pleasant experience, but with a few quirks. You can't beat the price, though!"
133,1282,"May 2 2005	Zetter rules	Just returned from a weekend trip to London. Staying at the Zetter was fabulous. Stayed at rooftop studio room. View over London was magnificent. Room's contemporary decoration stunning, everything was clean and somehow hip. Lots of lovely details, for example a free Time Out magazine waiting for us. Service was really good everywhere. Hotel even managed to get us vip-tickets to Fabric club for friday night. Eating one night at the hotel restaurant was a good choise. Food was plain, modern and yet traditional italian style. Really good. Two people eating and the bill was just  100. I think it is a reasonable price for good food and service.Over all - a really good experience."
134,1282,"Apr 8 2005 	Trendy 	Stayed here in a standard double room for 4 nights which was very comfortable, although it would have been cramped for 2 people. I loved the room lighting and the music selection. The bed was very comfortable with luxury linen. The wardrobe was very small so not great for longer stays. The bathroom was modern with a large walk-in shower, but no bath. The toiletries are a bit limited-no body lotion- and there is no bathrobe. I asked for a quiet room and was given one overlooking St John's Square which was great. Free tea/coffee are available on each floor by the vending machines. There is a dvd player and internet access (very expensive-why do hotels make you pay for 24 hours internet when you just need 2 hours in the evening!). The location is OK if you've been to London before or have business in the financial district, but I wouldn't recommend for first time tourists as it is away from the main attractions."
135,1282,"Mar 22 2005	Excellent night out at The Zetter	I stayed at The Zetter recently with a small group of friends. We loved the rooms and the restaurant, which are stylish without being off-putting. It was great to be able to drink, eat and sleep in the same place. The food was lovely, and well priced for both dinner and breakfast. Staff were accomodating and personable. I believe they hope to introduce al-fresco dining on St John's Square, which will be lovely in the summer."
136,1282,"Mar 11 2005	Met expectations 100%	Being young and of limited means, we were reluctant to drop the cash for a high-end hotel. But we decided we don't get to London often enough to waste our time sleeping in a generic tourist hotel obtained through Priceline (our usual source for hotels). After reading about the Zetter in the NYTimes, it sounded like the right blend of boutiquey-ness and off-the-beaten-track neighborhood that we were looking for. And the price would stretch our budget but not blow it. So we reserved a St. John's Square Superior room at the weekend special rate, and it gave us an extra element of our trip to look forward to.We felt it was worth every penny. The bed was very comfy and clean. The fixtures were funky, from the colored lighting to the square sink (a bit too close to the wall for me to lean over while brushing my teeth, but I'll forgive the designer that flaw). Internet access was an expensive additional charge, but we appreciated that we could hook up our laptop by ethernet cable or wireless OR use the in-room computer, which serves multiple duties as an internet terminal, television, jukebox, internet radio receiver, and movies-on-demand system. There was a random but interesting collection of old books and magazines to browse on the shelves. We were also thrilled to find a copy of the current issue of Time Out London waiting for us. As New Yorkers, we rely on our local edition of the T.O. franchise for finding fun, and buying a copy was going to be our first task after checking into the hotel. Scratch that one off our list!Still, this is not a luxury hotel. Don't expect to be waited upon or addressed by name. There is no doorman, and after hours you have to use your key to get into the lobby or up the elevator (although there was always somebody at the desk). There is no room service, only a vending machine with snacks and the convenience store at the gas station around the corner (which the front desk had no pretenses about recommending). Yet the folks at the front desk were friendly and helpful, and when we found some used coffee cups that the maids must have missed, they sent someone right away to fetch it and give us fresh water bottles. The water (one bottle still, one sparkling) was drawn from the hotel's own well! Very cool.In the neighborhood were a number of interesting decent restaurants with a crowd about our age (mid/late-20's). The restaurants were nothing to write home about, but we enjoyed eating and drinking surrounded by locals from the neighborhood rather than the tourist throngs who dominate other parts of the city. We didn't hear a single American accent anywhere in the neighborhood while we were there, which was exactly what we were looking for. We skipped the Zetter's own restaurant, because the prices were a bit higher than what we were looking to spend.All-in-all we were very happy with our stay. If you're looking for a spacious room or doting service or ultra-luxury, this is not your place. But if you want a hip and funky place that gets the basics right with some unique touches, I'd definitely recommend the Zetter. And I'd definitely consider going back for business or pleasure."

2,1283, until we settled for a smaller apartment on the first floor (which had the bathroom door not yet in place
3,1283, I was then told by the duty manager a few days later that it was the gas company - which would have been more realistic but makes me question why I was given conflicting reasons).Therefore
4,1283, and whats great about it is there is a big 24 hours Tesco right next door! Earls court area is nice
5,1283, we found that there was MORE buiding work but not as much. We were woken up at 8:30 due to builders!! The apartments are nice and very modern
1,1293,Nov 16 2009 	Luxury room at a good price for a fun city weekend	I experienced this hotel over a weekend so I don't think it is representative of what it is like on the weekday when there are lots of business travelers. The room was a little dark but very cool and comfortable and I loved the bath products. I didn't use many of the many ammenities that the hotel has to offer but they were all available.
2,1293,"Nov 14 2009 	Great hotel; exceptional service	This is an impeccably kept hotel, with some great features in the building.It's in the business district so you will get better rates at the weekend and it's close enough to the major attractions to still be convenient. Only downside, the restuarant is closed at weekends (but very good alternatives recommended).Katrina was great about making our wedding anniversary special - thank you. Great package to upgrade (champagne, chocs, rose petals etc.); recommend this if you are planning something special. Generally the service was without fault, everything was exceptionally well attended to and timed; including room service breakfast ordered for 9:45 and delivered at 9:45 exactly! Perfect service."
3,1293,Nov 2 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Really Helpful Staff - Stunning Room - Top Breakfast	Stayed here with my wife as a birthday treat for her. We were given a double upgrade to a suite which was amazing. Staff had put a card and chocolates in the room with petals on the bed......made to feel very special!!!!
4,1293,"Nov 1 2009 	Wonderfully luxurious	Spending the night at this hotel was one of the best decisions me and my husband have made. The only problem we had was finding the hotel, the exterior is quite discreet. The service upon arrival was very welcoming and the room was bigger then expected. The view wasn't great, but didn't spoil the night. Having room service available 24 hours came in handy when we were able to order dinner at 11pm.We didn't get the chance to make use of the bar or restaurant while we were there, so we'll have to book for longer next time!"
5,1293,"Nov 1 2009 	Fantastic mid-honeymoon break	We stayed here mid-way through our honeymoon before we travelled up to Scotland. We booked the hotel through 'last minute. com' and their 'secret hotels' option (easy to know which hotel it is if you just google the description), and we got a fantastic rate. The hotel and rooms are very nice, the photos don't really do it justice, our room was very plush with a huge bed, and walk in shower. We also sampled the room service on a couple of occasions, the breakfast in bed was delicious. All food is cooked in the adjacent Michelin star Bonds restaurant so is pretty amazing. Location wise, personally I thought it was amazing for our onward travel needs, also as it's in the business / financial district, at weekends you'll find it nice and quiet. It located in a very grand area of London but is within easy reach of some of the cultural attractions such as St. Pauls, Tate Modern, Design Museum, etc.Overall I would definitly recommend this hotel to others as a short city break."
6,1293,Oct 28 2009 	A small paradise within the Banking District of London	I simply adore this place since the first time I have had the pleasure of staying in London. It is the only hotel I have ever cared to rest my head in when I am there. Thank you Threadneedles for creating a cozy enviroment for me and my husband.
7,1293,"Oct 26 2009 	Beautiful hotel with some really nice touches	I met my wife here on a Saturday for a one night stay after she'd been to a conference in the city and I was able to leave the kids with the grand parents. Although slightly tricky to find by car on this particular weekend (mainly as the road was closed for construction work on a building up the road) it's ideally suited for the tube which is yards down the road from Bank station. At weekends this part of the city is dead (even the hotel restaurant is shut) so you need to get the tube for food or shopping but it's all just a short ride away and not a big deal for us. The reception area is beautifully appointed and all you could hope for in a five star. There is an honesty bar around the central area (well stocked and a really nice touch) with sofas, chairs and tables and complementary magazines with a beautiful stained glass domed ceiling which is very impressive. The hotel bar is equally well appointed with contemporary furniture and moody lighting and I can definitely recommend the cocktails.The rooms are well sized with more contemporary furniture and an excellent bathroom including a TV you can watch whilst in the bath - nice! There are tea and coffee making facilities which I always like as some of the other five stars I've stayed in expect you to order room service very time you want a hot drink.Breakfast was taken in Bonds the attached restaurant which really is a great space. Huge ceilings and great architecture match the award winning breakfast which offers huge choice and generous portions (always important on a Sunday morning).The service throughout the stay was very good and I'd be happy to stay there again. We got a good late deal on lastminute.com but I think if I'd have paid the full price I'd have felt short changed. The main reason being there was no spa, gym or swimming pool which I would have definitely used if there had been one but you can get room treatments if you fancy a massage. There is a Virgin gym around the corner which we could have used and surprised they don't offer a day membership through the hotel or at least mention it on booking in.On the whole really enjoyed the stay and will definitely consider staying again if a good deal comes up again."
8,1293,Oct 20 2009 	Amazing stay	We ended up getting a romantic package for the weekend. They managed to upgrade our room from an executive to a suite. It was absolutely amazing! The rooms are lush and the breakfast was amazing. They had classical music on the radio when we walked in!
9,1293,"Oct 18 2009 	Great gem in the city	Stayed at Threadneedles twice now and each occasion had a really great stay. Attentive staff, good size rooms and amenities. The bed was large and comfortable pillows and duvets. Also, the housekeeping staff had noticed that it was our anniversary, and rose petalled the whole room and bathroom when we returned. Only downside is of course it's in the centre of the city so, bars/restaurants need to be thought about in advance as at a weekend the environ is dead. Saying that the hotel does do a great range in cocktails, and your not far from getting to places."
10,1293,"Sep 24 2009 	stay at this hotel !!!!!!!	We stayed on our wedding night &amp; found petals scattered around, chocolates &amp; a card - all from hotel !!!!what a place, great location in the city - especially weekends - no office workers around !rooms are really well appointed, the main reception / lobby is knockout, staff are tremendous very courteous &amp; friendly - not at all intimidating.Great breakfast ( in bed ) - wish we could have stayed longer."
11,1293,"Sep 19 2009 	FABULOUS	We booked hotel for our anniversary as part of a package to see Sister Act. Friendly and attentive staff, attention to detail in the room is excellent. Had wanted to eat in the restaurant but couldn't as we wouldn't have made it across London for the show as the restaurant didn't open until 6pm, which surprised us. Comfortable bed, great toiletries, excellent bathroom. My husband enjoys his food said it was the best breakfast he'd ever had. Fantastic domed ceiling in reception. Just loved it all. To make it truly exceptional at weekends when the hotel isn't as busy a 12 O'clock check out should be the norm. 11am on a romantic break is a bit early especially as housekeeping knocked at 11.01am and asked us how long we'd be!If they could start serving dinner at 5.30pm for pre-theatre and later check-outs they'd be onto a winner."
12,1293,"Sep 17 2009 	Very impressed	I recently spent the weekend in London en route back to Australia while my husband was still travelling. Because of its location in the City of London financial district, Threadneedles offers very competitive weekend rates and its proximity to the Tube, buses, etc . make it convenient for shopping and other attractions. The staff were efficient, courteous and helpful and the room very comfortable, modern and spacious, particularly by London standards. While the attached restaurant is closed on the weekends, the room service was very good (breakfast was excellent) and promptly delivered. A most pleasant experience."
13,1293,"Sep 14 2009 	Abhorrent Service at an Otherwise Great Hotel	This boutique hotel has great rooms and is very well-located for the business traveller with meetings in the City. But, for such a nice hotel, the service is inexcuseably awful. The concierge has no knowledge of the area and can't recommend lunch or dinner places on weekends or at night. Room service orders are botched. Laundry sent out only comes back on time when you threaten not to pay. Wake-up calls come late. (A wake-up call set for 6 am came at 6:30, and the called said, &quot;Whoopsie! Are you awake?&quot;) Cars ordered do not arrive. The housekeeping staff is overly aggressive and intrusive. I would recommend this hotel only (a) if you're stuck in the city; and (b) if the Andaz or Apex is booked! This could be a great hotel, but management needs to pull it together."
14,1293,"Sep 10 2009 	Highly Recommended! 5 stars at a great price!	My husband and I stayed at the Threadneedles for three nights before going to Portugal. It was a great hotel - I have nothing bad to say about the facility. The lobby is beautiful, our room was spotless, spacious, and the bathroom was gorgeous. A beautiful large shower and soaker tub! The only complaint we had was that the men at the front desk were &quot;decorative, not functional&quot;. They all looked like GQ models, however; they didn't seem to know the city and could not answer any of our basic questions! Thankfully we had done our research and didn't really need their help. The hotel is located in the middle of the financial district so on weekends it is a ghost town. However, because of it's non-touristy location, you can find some great prices online (we got our third night free!). The tube is right across the street and we were able to take the tube from the airport directly to the hotel!"
15,1293,"Sep 5 2009 	Fabulous weekend stay	The hotel is in the heart of the City of London - it is much more peaceful than the West End at the weekend which is packed with tourists at this time of the year. We took taxis which were plentiful but Bank tube station is nearby. Lovely area for wandering around - the buildings are stunningly beautiful. Spitalfields market is within strolling distance - on Sunday there is an Art and Design market which is brilliant and very different to a normal market. Although the hotel restaurant wasn't open at the weekend, the bar did very good tapas and cocktails. The hotel staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room was one of the best we have ever stayed in - the tv in the bathroom was a great novelty. Plentiful toiletries, including bath salts and a bath duck, dressing gown and slippers. There was even a large umbrella which luckily we didn't need. Freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast and great coffee. I would really recommend this hotel for a quiet romantic weekend break."
16,1293,"Aug 20 2009 	Top boutique hotel excellent value at week-ends	We managed to get a very good deal here including an updgrade to a suite (Hilary) and the deal was excellent value for money. As others have stated this part of London (City) is dead at week-ends hence the very good rates. Also this means that the hotel restaurant (Bonds) is closed so you need to find somewhere else to eat, however this isn't a problem as number of nice places to eat nearby - Spitalfields is a short stroll away on a nice evening (I actually love the City when it's quiet) or a short hop in a taxi. The bar is still open at week-ends, stunning to look at but might be pretty empty, good for a cocktail before you head out and serves amazing Mojito's (although not cheap and if you charge to your room a 12.5% service will be added automatically). Spitafields market is also well worth a visit on a Sunday when all the stalls are open. Overall a beautiful hotel and a great experience - perfect for a romantic break, stunning design, v.comfortable beds, and one of the best full English breakfasts anywhere (although service at breakfast was a bit hit or miss)."
17,1293,"Aug 12 2009 	Not bad but better value elsewhere?	Enjoyed my stay here. Couple of small negative points. Booked a double room which ended up being two twins shoved together with a noticeable bump down the middle - not ideal for a romantic night! Also (as I note another reviewer here noted) they needed two phone calls to respond to requests, when surely one should suffice at a hotel of this class. Morning paper missing too. I know these can seem like small grumbles, but when you pay for a hotel of this class you expect these basic things to work seamlessly. I left comparing this to my stay at the Cavendish which I loved and where I felt service was better. I know which one I will be staying at next time."
18,1293,"Aug 9 2009 	Extremely comfortable quiet and amazing value	Got a late booking and so a great deal, and we were upgraded as well. Living locally and knowing London very well we really appreciate the location and the comparatively high standards. Lobby which is old bank HQ - huge and beautiful space topped by stained glass dome. Great first impression. Room was directly on Threadneedle street but very quiet on a Saturday night, and probably midweek because of the double glazing. Service was friendly, efficient and refreshingly discrete. Bed was delightfully comfortable and bathroom extremely good. Room much better than a Marriot and we feel better than the Four Seasons Canary Wharf which is old tattty and overpriced. Parking may need to be NCPmidweek but not so at weekends where there are spaces to be found nearby in city side streets. In summary an extremely good night, slept deeply in great comfort, and so excellent value for money."
19,1293,"Jul 28 2009 	Home away from home.	Threadneedles is centrally located in The City of London in an historic building that has been elegantly updated while being very mindful of it's history.The entire staff is very knowledgable, and attentive to details.Thanks for an enjoyable stay away from home."
20,1293,"Jul 23 2009 	Everything you would expect of a 5* hotel	Opulent, stunning and everything you would expect of a central London Hotel. Threadneedles is a stunning luxury 5 * hotel opposite the bank of England. Stunning spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. High quailty towels, bedding and extras. dressing gowns, slippers and turn down in the evening. Totally centrally placed for enjoying the sights of London, without the hustle and bustle. Excellent food and service. Beautiful quiet bar which is used by others during the evening. The reception doubles as library and relaxation area, if your able to take your eyes from the stunning glass ceiling. Fantastic"
21,1293,"Jul 15 2009 	Very Pleasant Stay	Stayed in the Threadneedles Hotel in June with my partner on a weekend break. Hotel was very close to Bank of England &amp; 2 - 3 mintue walk to Bank tube station. As other reviewers have mentioned there is not alot of shops or resturants ect but with the tube being so close &amp; Tower Bridge &amp; Liverpool Street Station within walking distance you will find something.The hotel itself is lovely, beautiful dome ceiling in the lobby &amp; the honestly bar is a wonderful idea (as long everyone is honest &amp; doesnt put your room number down insted of theres!) We opted for the Breakfast in bed and were not disapointed. Fresh Fruit, Toast, Jams, Full English Breakfast &amp; Muffins were delicious.We stayed in an executive room of which we were upgraded from a double deluxe, bed was very comfortable &amp; the bottle of water upon turn down was lovely idea.The bathroom was quite big &amp; had a tv in it, which is a fab idea if you want to sit in the huge bath and watch tv at the same time! The little rubber duck which reads 'please take me home' it a nice touch.I would recommend this hotel to anyone - its clean &amp; the staff are always friendly &amp; you always get your breakfast on time! Result. Well worth the money!"
22,1293,Jul 6 2009 	really good	We only stayed for one night as we had an engagement to attend in the city that evening and decided to stay nearby. The hotel was very good and I thought the rooms were designed very well. Nice touches like bottles of water at turn down and even the newspaper had it's own bag! There was a TV in the bathroom and the toiletries were very nice and plentiful. We also had a good breakfast with very good service. The bed was very comfortable too. Overall really good.
23,1293,"Jun 25 2009 	A pleasant experience	The hotel was beautiful, the staff was very helpful, and the bartenders at Bonds were very accommodating, if not particularly social. The location was conveniently a short walk of three blocks away from my office, but, being in the City of London, the area was decidedly dead on the nights and weekend."
24,1293,"Jun 6 2009 	Amazing hotel!	What a wonderful hotel! We got an excellent three night deal via Expedia. Room was beautiful and the bed was the best one we have ever slept in. Hotel staff were professional but welcoming. Free newspaper and bottled water delivered to the room. The bathroom even had a television! Lovely shampoo, bodywash, etc. The only minor niggle was that our room hadn't been serviced by 3pm when we wanted to watch the FA Cup Final.The hotel has an honesty bar for residents so you can have a drink underneath the beautiful dome. Drinks are expensive but well worth it for the atmosphere.Nearest tube is Bank but Liverpool Street station is only 10 minutes walk away. The City is quiet at weekends but you can easily reach other areas and the weekend is the best time to see the City of London."
25,1293,"May 31 2009 	Great place for a special occasion	Stayed overnight on their &quot;romantic package&quot; - special weekend deal for a hotel that is aimed primarily at the business user during the week. Champagne and chocolates in room, flower petals on bed etc - all exactly as promised.Located almost next door to the Bank of England - not the usual spot for a leisure hotel, and very understated from the outside, so much so that you don't realise it's a hotel at all. Once inside it's luxury throughout, with excellent service. The lobby has a massive stained glass dome, where you can sit and gaze upwards, whilst using their honesty bar.Rooms excellent (although we did get a free upgrade to an executive suite, so they may not all be quite as big).Well located for attractions such as Tower of London, although at weekend restuarants can be hard to come by in the vicinity. Try Northbank on the Thames by the Millenium Bridge."
26,1293,"May 25 2009 	Nice Hotel just need to remember cutlery!	We booked the hotel via lastminute.com and it was one of their 'top secret hotels'The hotel was nice and staff seemed friendly enoughDue to the fact the hotel was near the Bank of England and we stayed at a weekend, it was very quiteI loved the fact i could watch the telly in the bathroom whilst having a relaxing soak in the bath Our booking didn't include breakfast so we thought as a treat due to our trip being for our anniversary we would order room service for breakfast (we went for bacon sandwiches and croissants)The food came and was hot but there was no cutlery other than teaspoons, so we rang reception to get something sent up.... it didn't happen and our breakfast would have been cold if we had waited.... believe me, trying to cut and butter a croissant with a teaspoon is not the easiest!Other than the breakfast mishap we both really enjoyed the stay"
27,1293,"May 22 2009 	FABULOUS HOTEL- NEEDS TO WORK ON THE SERVICE	We stayed here one night for a wedding that was next door.When we phoned to ask about an extra bed for our daughter no mention of a charge was made, we phoned twice. Both times we were told as long as we booked a bigger room we could have a cot.When we arrived we were asked if we wanted twin beds, we said no we requested a king bed and a roll away cot for the child. We were told it would be and extra 50 pounds!We were taken to our room, and it had twin beds. We were in a hurry to get to the wedding so were willing to make do! We then got a phone call apologizing for the mix up and they would move us to the room next door which was the room we had booked and paid for, and they would give us the bed at no charge for our inconvenience!When we went to check out the next morning.. we were told we had to pay 50 pounds for the bed! We explained to the woman what had transpired the previous day.. she just kept saying NO! As if it was not what had happened???We finally spoke to the manager, who made it obvious he did not believe us but he was going to waive the charge!We left with a bad impression of the hotel though it was absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully appointed!"
28,1293,"May 13 2009 	The best hotel experience ever	The hotel was simply great, from the moment you enter the lobby until you you reach your room; you are simply pampered all the way. A new bottle of water on daily basis, the cleanest sheets ever and bathroom. The guidance and tips the reception staff offered me as a tourist in London was great and to the point and actually they allowed me to save money in relation to transportation fees and which way to take to reach my destinations."
29,1293,"Apr 11 2009 	Wow. I don't want to go 3* again!	I only stayed one night, and booked the hotel on Friday for Friday, my original hotel booking at another hotel had falled through.The location for the hotel is fantastic - right in the centre of the city within 2m walk of bank and within a 10m bus ride of the value and nice restaurants of the east end - think Indian food. It's also a place where you can get to Oxford Street by tube or bus withtout a problem.The hotel itself; I was totally blown away by the quality of the decor and the furnishings. I had a double room - which my invoice has marked as &quot;LUX&quot; (which I'm assuming was luxury) but I think I was booking 'standard'. Perhaps it was a free upgrade - who knows.The room looked like it belonged in an upmarket house and didn't look like a hotel room at all. The things that stood out for me in the hotel werea. The bed linen was all fresh and high quality. THere was none of this white sheet that you usually get between you and the actual duvet (a short cut for hotel staff to keep their covers cleaner for longer). The bed was super comfortable - I had a backache that had persisted for a week, but the bed let me drift off within minutes of trying to sleep.b. We left the room for 1hour to get something to eat, and even though we'd messed the bed up just unpacking - housekeeping had come in and retidyied it!!! I was so blown away. And they left complimentary sparkling water and still water too.c. The toiletries were just lovely and great becuase we got a chance to freshen up before we left the hotel and there was enough for 2 - 3 showers without needing a replacement.d. The ambience of the room was lovely and there was a plasma tv in the shower (which incidentally was marble throughout).All in all, I can't find fault with the hotel and for the price I paid, I can't believe how fantastic it was. I may never stay there again, but only because I like to get a broad experience of hotels - and that means trying other hotels instead. However, if I was a frequent visitor to London, I would definitely stay there, and I have a feeling, that I was lucky to have lost my first choice hotel.I will treasure the memory of that day for a long time to come."
30,1293,"Mar 9 2009 	Jewel of a property in heart of financial district	Threadneedles is truly a gem. Stayed for four nights on a recent business trip and could not have been more pleased. The staff was as helpful and attentive as any I have encountered anywhere. The rooms are well appointed and very private. An ideal location for our business in the financial district. Convenient by underground and walking to anywhere you need to go in London. St. Paul's Cathedral was an easy 10 minute walk, and the Bank tube station is a two minute stroll. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic - marble, wonderful shower, great toiletries, etc. Shopping at nearby London Exchange is a plus."
31,1293,"Jan 3 2009	good but not excellent	My boyfriend booked this hotel for my birthday, we spent two nights in a Studio room. The room was spacious, with a sitting area at the end. The room service was excellent even at 11.30 at night, although a few little niggles made this hotel just above average on my list rather than excellent.A small light above the shower fell down and live wires hung near my boyfriend currently in the shower at the time. We also found a small amount of blood on a hand towel which had obviously came from another room and accidently appeared in our clean pile!Other than this our stay was enjoyable and we would definitely go back."
32,1293,"Jan 1 2009	Excellent	This hotel is smack in the middle of the city financial district so at weekends 1) in the absence of city slickers they offer good rates and (2) this historical area is blissfully peaceful. Two minutes from Bank tube station it really is a calm oasis from the bustle of the west end. Very few shops and restaurants open at weekends but nearby Liverpool Street station environs offer a bit of both. Nice, smallish double room, immaculately clean. Returning to my room one evening I interrupted the turndown service (which I am not a fan of). I mentioned this on a feedback form and the next day I received an e-mail apologising. I think this is the type of hotel that would note your preferences on their system to ensure your next visit is just how you like it. In summary I would totally and utterly recommend this hotel at weekends."
33,1293,"Dec 20 2008 	Highly Recommended	I cannot speak more highly of this boutique hotel, in fact I would go as far as to say its the best hotel I have stayed in throughout the UK.From the moment you walk in the discreet entrance next to Bonds restaurant, through to the the gloriously decorated foyer with its fabulous dome you leave London behind and enter a haven of charm and peace.Their attention to detail was outstanding, from the reception desk to the immensely polite and professional staff to the fantastic touches in the rooms. The personal business cards, the bath salts and rubber duck in the bathroom, the individual him and her menus for bath times, the ipod dock, the welcomed turn down service, the dangerously soft bed, the delicious power breakfast, all led to an experience worth every penny and one I cannot wait to repeat."
34,1293,"Dec 16 2008 	Fantastic bargain for a weekend in The City	I loved this hotel and my husband and I had a fantastic weekend break here earlier this year. The old banking hall is gorgeous, the rooms are luxurious and the service was excellent both times I stayed. (I had stayed on my own the previous weekend as I was having dinner with friends in London). There are also nice touches like cards suggesting a biscoti and brandy and offers of movies and popcorn in your room. The studio rooms are nicer than the suites in my view (I looked around both), as the studios are lovely large rooms, wheras the suites I looked at had 1 normal sized room with another normal sized room off it. Very kindly they upgraded us and very unusually, I asked to be downgraded back to a studio from a suite. They were very patient while I decided which to have too. At 225 + VAT for a studio on a Friday and Saturday night this was a luxurious bargain. We booked direct with the hotel. Service was attentive, fast, smooth and they didn't bat an eyelid when I phoned at 4pm and said I'd forgotten a comb and could they please buy one and leave it in my room for when I arrived at 5.30. I also love the small Threadneedles business cards showing your direct room number, very cool. As is the honesty bar. I'd stay here again, anytime, really liked it a lot."
35,1293,"Dec 12 2008 	Warm and friendly	Stayed for just one night. The room was lovely and the bathroom very warm and spacious. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only disapointment was room service. The food arrived under cooked and although a new order was supposed to be on the way it never arrived. Not to worry, the bed was very comfortable and room service breakfast excellent. I would definitely stay here again for the location and warm feeling of the hotel."
36,1293,"Dec 4 2008 	What a wonderful hotel!	Upon opening the front doors, you enter a truly gorgeous hotel! The foyer was constantly busy with guests at the very popular honesty bar, unfortunately we did not get chance to use this ourselves, what a fantastic idea though!The front of house team were especially welcoming on arrival asking how our journey was, if there was anything that they could do for us and a complimentary bedroom upgrade, they couldnt do any more.The room was amazing, with of the amenities that you could wish for including bath salts. If Id have stayed a second night Id have taken the option to order the movie menu where you can order popcorn and ice cream and lay in their ever so comfortable beds watching movies.This hotel is ideally located for whatever you are doing in London with the tube, 2 minutes down the road.I will certainly be returning!"
37,1293,"Nov 24 2008 	100% Perfect	Lovely Hotel, great price, brilliant staff, great location . I promise I dont work for them.Stayed a Friday night for my wifes birthday and it was perfect. Bank tube is a few minutes walk away which means London is very accessible. Compared with other hotels of this calibre in London you are paying about 50% less, though I do believe during the week rates are higher.Must not forget the breakfast which was very good ."
38,1293,"Nov 10 2008 	A Memorable Evening	I booked this hotel as part of a surprise 40th birthday present for my fiance. We were not disappointed as it is lovely. The staff were friendly, polite &amp; helpful. The room was spacious, clean and had some very nice touches such as an ipod docking station, lots of reading material, very nice toiletries (including a rubber duck by the bath!) and a TV in the bathroom.  When we returned from our evening out the bed was turned down, the curtains drawn and iced water left by the bed. The only thing missing was chocolates on the pillow!  The only criticism we have regarding our stay was that for such an expensive &amp; stylish hotel there is virtually no soundproofing between the rooms. You really can hear everything that goes on next door........We would happily recommend this hotel but don't forget to pack ear plugs!Top Tip: If you intend to stay at this hotel at a weekend then you should check their rate directly. We found it is the same as through some discounted travel websites but includes breakfast."
39,1293,"Sep 28 2008	Slightly disappointing	Booked at the last minute as a suprise for my partner to celebrate good news &amp; the guy on the 'phone said they could do something special. When I've previously stayed at One Aldwych we've been given a cake on my birthday or an upgrade. Nothing was provided at Threadneedles which is much emptier at the weekend. No major problems with the room ( other than uht milk): the &quot;Friday night package&quot; included champagne &amp; rose petals. The &quot;luxury chocolates&quot; turned out to be Terry's all Gold which at least gave us a laugh given all the luxury chocolate shops nearby. The food was a let down. Dinner was ok &amp; the service was good but in the morning I asked for a vegetarian breakfast &amp; was told that on our package I could have the power breakfast without meat. On taking my first mouthful of mushroom I bit into a piece of blackpudding hidden beneath it, ugh! There was no assam tea at breakfast, we were given 2 tea bags &amp; a pot of water, not what I expect at a 5 star hotel. The poached eggs were rock hard &amp; I was glad to get home &amp; make a decent pot of tea! We were thinking of booking for New Year's eve as Threadneedles is fairly local to us butafter this experience we won't be going back. As shame as there is a lot that'sgood about it."
40,1293,Sep 23 2008	Fantastic stay!	Our stay here was out of this world and felt very special.Everything was absolutely perfect - the room was amazing and the staff were really lovely.The Power Breakfast was delicious.Top marks all round! Definitely recommend it.
41,1293,"Sep 22 2008 	short breaks in your home town	sometimes it's very nice to go on holiday 30mins from where you live, no hassle with airports or long car journeys, just an overnight romantic get away. threadneedles may be in the city, which is, granted, a little quiet over the weekend, but why not do what we did. a pre-dinner cocktail on the roof top of the coq d'argent followed by an amazing meal in Bonds restaurant and a most wonderfully pampered night complete with rose petals on the bed in an executive room. west end hustle and bustle is over-rated."
42,1293,"Sep 8 2008 	pleasant hotel in The City	We stayed four nights in this hotel and found it to be well located, and very welcoming. All the staff were very helpful, no matter what our requests. The room was spacious, quiet and light, and the bathroom was very big. However, it was annoying to have to pay for breakfasts and internet access on top of a high room rate, unlike its competitor around the corner, the Hotel Andaz. But if you want to feel like you've stepped into a bit of London tradition, the magnificent glass dome ceiling in the lobby will set the tone straight away. The leather couches give you a feeling of being in a London 'club' and the comfort level is high throughout. It's close to plenty of London landmarks, and there are several good local dining choices, eg Gowings Wine Bar (mainly fish dishes, well cooked) and a great pub serving excellent steaks down the alleyway from the hotel (I know it's meant to be a proper street but most inner London streets seem like narrow alleys to me!) Overall, very welcoming, comfortable and relaxing."
43,1293,"Aug 15 2008 	Good to so so for price	Stayed at Threadneedles for a week in August. Like other reviewers have said, if you are looking for a bustling area on the weekend, this is not the place. The streets/restaurants surrounding the hotel are quite literally bare on Saturday &amp; Sunday. The Bank tube station is nearby, so getting somewhere to eat besides room service is fairly easy on the weekend.The room was spacious, nice bed linens and towels, small tv in the bathroom is a nice touch. A fruit plate greeted us upon our arrival, apples, banana, grapes, orange and a kiwi. A few apples that I ate were replaced during my stay. Very clean overall. The pop up plug adaptor on the desk was helpful. Hotel staff was very friendly. Used room service a few times, food arrived fairly quickly. Things I didn't like so much; there was no where to plug the hair dryer in in the bathroom, bit odd I thought. Internet is not free, pricier hotels never seem to have free wireless internet, but they should. When I'm paying this price for a hotel it would be nice not to be nickeld and dimed quite so much. The key card I was given kept not working. I had to go to the front desk 4 times during my stay to have them reset my card. I've had cards stop working before but never that often. I could hear people stomping up and down the hall very well, and could hear room next door from the bathroom. All in all a nice place for sure, comfortable, but a bit underwhelming overall. Probably will not be back unless it's on the expense account."
44,1293,"Aug 9 2008 	Very nice quiet hotel	Excellent hotel. Stayed only one night arriving late. Rooms are clean, and smartly appointed. Very stylish. Service was excellent. Voltage converters sent right up to the room. Only draw back is that the rooms are a bit dark. Excellent hotel for the business traveler; it is five stars. Very convenient to law firm of White &amp; Case."
45,1293,Jul 20 2008	Brilliant quality and service - still!	Stayed in the Threadneedles Hotel again and was as impressed as the first time I stayed.Brilliantly clean and well maintained it was a joy to kick back and just enjoy the room.Ate Dinner in the Bonds restaurant - great food and service. Breakfast was similarly good. Like all hotels in a commercial London district it has great weekend rates and when you look at what you get it is great value.
46,1293,"Jul 10 2008 	London's hidden gem	My girlfriend and I stayed at Threadneedles for a romantic weekend in the City. The hotel is tucked away in Threadneedle Street, opposite the Bank of England in the ancient Square Mile of the City of London. The interior is stuning - highlight being a large dome of stained glass in the plush foyer. As imagined, the hotel was quiet at the weekend but well worth the visit. The room was beautiful (we were in The Terrace, which has a balcony overlooking the city!) and had been fitted out with attention to every detail. The bed was also really comfortable, and breakfast was interesting, with a good selection. Staff, both on the font desk and in the restaurant, were very friendly and helpful.If you are looking for a weekend break in the West End, this is the wrong side of town, but we were glad to be somewhere a little quieter. Threadneedles is a hidden gem in the City. Well worth a visit if you can!"
47,1293,"May 31 2008 	Super Chic	This hotel was super chic. It's right in the heart of the best attractions, but on small side street, that's out of the way. The reception was warm and friendly, and were happy to meet all your expectations. The room was lavish and sexy. Perfect for my first time in London, as a New Yorker. Perfect ! A great getaway."
48,1293,"May 28 2008 	What a Great Stay	The hotel was great. We didn't really hang much in the lobby, and for an American visiting London, the room was a good size compared to what I have had in the past. Very shiek - almost W-esque. Clean and everything felt new. The soaking tub and shower stall (a little bit small on the shower stall) made the new bathroom outstanding. It is in the business district, so there is not a whole lot to do right around the hotel (and our 2 drinks at the Pacific Oriental across the street for 40 pounds didn't inspire us to search very hard). The Bank Station and Monument Station are right there, so you can get anywhere pretty easy. The staff was VERY helpful - making reservations and mailing us some documents that we accidentally left behind. I would definitley recommend this place."
49,1293,"May 7 2008 	Threadneedles is lovely	This was a really nice hideaway hotel in the city. The room was luxurious. I thought the room service menu didnt offer much, and neither did the food on offer for dinner (all food was supplied by Bonds restaurant next door). Nevertheless, it was great."
50,1293,"Mar 27 2008	A perfect boutique hotel	Quite simply this is the nicest, best value hotel I have stayed in in London. My girlfriend and i had a fantastic stay with great service at all times. we got a free room upgrade and the breakfast (which we had in the room) was superb. Lovely and quiet at the weekend and easy to get into central London. highly recommended!"
51,1293,"Mar 3 2008	Disappointing	Stayed with my wife between Christmas and New Year. The hotel lobby looks great and the rooms are stylish but the hotel is let down by so many things.- First room was a pain - not enough lights and the glass sliding door for the bathroom did not fit properly so no privacy- Getting breakfast was a huge pain most mornings. Did not arrive in time and got a load of rubbish on the phone when chasing. One morning I had to just give up trying to get it delivered.- A fruit plate arrived with the rotten fruit hidden by fresh fruit on topThe hotel were very helpful when water came through the bathroom ceiling - they moved us to a much larger room and gave us a free bottle of champagne, which was great. Would also not recommend as a business hotel as wireless broadband was very expensive.Prices on the website also do not include VAT, which is unusual for the UK."
52,1293,"Feb 3 2008 	Bank on it.	We discovered this hotel on our last visit to London and thought it looked very nice. For our most recent trip to London, the rate for this hotel was pretty good compared to comparable West End hotels so we figured after several visits to London staying a little out of the way would be just fine for us. The hotel is very nice and attractive. The lobby has an outstanding handed painted glass dome that is very beautiful. The hotels contemporary dcor is warm and relaxing and flows throughout the property. We had an executive room which is several room sizes up from the smallest room. It was a good size room but a little smaller then we thought it would be. The dcor was great, with nice earth tones and cool looking light fixtures that gave off a soft glow. The TV was too small and placed in a tall cage that blocked your view unless you were in the bed. Although not that important to us, it should be noted that the TV channel selections also were very limited when it came to foreign stations. The room also was beginning to show some minor wear and tear. Some nice artwork was on the walls, and overall it was a pleasant room to relax in. The large limestone bathroom was very nice with separate shower, heated towel rack, and flat screen TV.The one area that needs some improvement at this hotel is service. It was very inconsistent. Since it is a small hotel, it seems the front desk staff does everything from concierge to telephone operator. Some members of the staff were very good, some were not. The turn down service was also inconsistent, but when it was done right, it was very nice with a bucket of ice, large bottle of water and a lit candle in the bathroom. We stayed for seven nights so we had the chance to experience the area during the week and weekend. It is very quiet on the weekends with almost every store in the immediate area closed. The best place to go if you need something is Liverpool Station, a ten minute walk. During the week, the area is very active during the day but gets quiet fast at night. The Bank tube station is a three minute walk with multiple lines that can put you in many tourist areas in ten minutes.If you are a first time visitor to London, you may not want to stay here. If you have been to London before, this location could work out well for you. London is a very busy and crowded city, especially in the main tourist spots. A stay at Threadneedles allows you to stay at a nice modern design hotel, in a relaxing area, yet with access to all the fun pretty quickly via a great tube system."
53,1293,"Dec 14 2007 	Loved the Honesty Bar	This is without doubt the finest hotel that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.It contrasts classical style with modern amenities in keeping with it's City of London locality.From the moment you enter the hotel from the bustle of Threadneedles Street you are enveloped in a calming opulence that both stimulates and soothes the senses. Your eyes are drawn to the magnificant stained glass dome as the attentive staff invite you to sit down as you check in. You are then guided to your room that is so superior to the ordinary that it beggars belief.But it's the touches that make this hotel so special. Like the complimentary business cards that you receive on arrival informing friends and associates that you are in residence, or the champagne, strawberries and rose petal bath that can be arranged for the romantics.And make sure you have a meal in the restaurant- Brownes, it is outstanding and one of London's best kept secrets. As is the bar wihich is a hive of activity in the early evening as brokers and bankers converge after a busy day. And if you come in late then head to the Honesty Bar and help yourself to whatever you like. And if you are honest (like me) write it down in the book and then settle into the sumptuous chairs under the dome to the gentle sound of Cafe del Mar and pass the late evening in the company of friends.This is a truely exceptional hotel, run by a great hotelier and his very friendly helpful team."
54,1293,"Dec 8 2007	Didn't meet expectations	We have just come back from staying at the Threadneedles. The decor is lovely and a nice grand reception but, I have to agree with the reviewer that said this doesn't live up to its 5 star rating and the rate you pay. We had difficulties ordering room service, which then took a long time to arrive and was tiny and half cooked. For a breakfast that came to around 45 for 2 it was very disappointing. The staff generally did not live up to what a hotel of this calibre should manage including the lack of offer of help with luggage."
55,1293,"Nov 23 2007 	Worth every penny	I took my girlfriend here for a special occassion and it exceeded all expectations.The Executive room was huge and the rose petals on the bed and champange on arrival certainly did the job!Staff were friendly, and as we were there on the weekend the place was very quiet which gave the place a very relaxing feel.Will definately go back."
56,1293,"Nov 9 2007 	A hidden gem	The decor is wonderful, from the glass dome in the reception area to the very comfortable and well equipped bedrooms.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and made our stay most enjoyable. The location was excellent, within easy walking distance of restaurants, nightlife and the underground.The bar was always lively and bustling too.Thoroughly recommended"
57,1293,"Oct 15 2007 	Wonderful treat...	We stayed here for one night for our anniversary. It was a gorgeous hotel. The attention to detail was fantastic. Room service good and I highly recommend the American breakfast...mmmm...very yummy. Overall it was a real treat. The rooms were decorated beautifully, TV in bathroom was a treat (esp as the rugby semi-final was on!). Infact the room was so nice we decided to stay in instead of go out for the evening. The only thing was that I would not recommend it for children as the windows opened from the bottom up and led straight out onto a very small ledge and then onto....air! However, for us on an anniversary treat without our children it was not a problem atall. Pleasant, friendly staff and very clean. Overall 5 stars from us!"
58,1293,"Sep 29 2007 	Excellent 5 star hotel	We stayed for one night in the hotel, the room was good with a decent LCD TV. The bathroom was excellent with a large bath and a great walk-in shower, the LCD TV in the bathroom was also a nice touch.The breakfast was excellent and the decor of the hotel was amazing.I am hard to please but this hotel impressed me.The only thing to be aware of is at weekends in the City where this hotel is located none of the shops, cafes or restaurants are open, however it is just a tube trip to these amenities."
59,1293,"Sep 22 2007 	Bring earplugs	After reading the euphoric reviews on this page I was surprised when I arrived. Heaving our heavy luggage over the entrance steps (handicapped guests beware) no one made a point of giving us any assistance. I don't want to exaggerate, it's only three steps, but well... This kind of indifference was our continuous experience. We had problems with the TV, causing some grimacing at the reception, but yes, they were resolved... after a while. The affluent twenty-something who needs a Louis Vuitton sales rep coming to her room (a service the hotel might get a hefty commission for) will be satisfied. The non-deaf might have a hard time sleeping as various London bus lines are roaring through Threadneedle street (and yes, they do have night bus lines here, too). Bring earplugs. If the bus doesn't, the twenty-somethings will keep you from sleeping.Nice soap, nice rooms, big beds. There are not many places like this in the City of London. But it must have been a long way down from what I read on this page to where I have been."
60,1293,"Sep 16 2007 	Excellent	My Husbdand and I stayed at this hotel for a Saturday night in September. We have stayed in many similarly rated hotels in London and this was definately the best. We highly recommend it for tourists and business travellers. The hotel is a beautiful building both inside and out. It is lavishly decorated and the hotel has made the most of the building's period features. We booked a studio suite and were suitably impressed when we saw our room. It was very spacious, modern yet lavish decoration, and had everything you could expect from a 5 star hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel, however the restaurant looked impressive. Staff couldn't be more helpful. The hotel is quite pricey, however we would definately choose to stay in this hotel over other 5 stars in London. As it is in the heart of the City, the shops in the area are closed at weekends and it is very quiet, so it's helpful that it is so close to Bank station and it is very easy to get to all the major tourist attractions. We felt that the quality of the hotel was far superior to the 5 stars in more convenient loations, such as Mayfair or Oxford Circus etc for a similar price. The only downside to this hotel is that similarly to other prestigious hotels in London, the hotel does not have it's own car park. It is quite difficult to find. (A valet service would definately be helpful.) We parked in 140 London Wall Car park - which is at the London Wall Museum and is about a 10-15 minute walk away from the hotel. This car park was quite a find as it was a fixed fee of 3 for overnight parking at weekends. We are used to paying 20 to 30 per day in central London!Overall, we highly recommend this hotel and will definately be staying there again."
61,1293,"Sep 1 2007 	Not a 5-star at all....	Not under any circumstance is this a 5-star hotel. Having stayed in many hotels over the years, I can honestly say that this is a decent 4-star at best. There is absolutely no parking and the nearest car park is a good 7-minute walk away - no valet parking either.In addition, the hotel has an environmentally friendly policy whereby they do not change your towels for a couple of days. I am not staying in a 5-star hotel and paying the premium to do so to worry in the slightest bit about the environment. This is a policy bandied about far too much of late. Moreover, the sink blocked up due to the plug hole release mechanism failing. Whilst the staff were very attentive in sorting out this problem, it really ought not to happen in a hotel that is supposedly 5-star.Finally, whilst there was an excellent turn-down service with a bottle of water and ice being brought to one's room, the service occured between 6pm and 7pm in the evening - not really the best time when people are either relaxing before going out for the evening and/or getting ready to go out. Turn down should really take place around 9-10pm, when some people actually go to bed."
62,1293,"Jul 26 2007 	Another stay at a great hotel	I stay at the Threadneedles at a minimum once a month when in London on business. Its the only hotel I ever consider staying. This hotel could write the book on customer service. The doorman makes it a point to know my name, the hotel staff even stands up as you enter the building or leave the elevator. In a time where customer service is a lost art, this hotel gets it right and then some. I spend lots of time in hotels, so I know something on this subject, and I can 100% say this hotel will do you right and you will not be disappointed. I am not a person to normally give glowing reviews, but I am more than happy to recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay here for a very nice stayjust like home."
63,1293,Jul 16 2007 	Amazing!	What can I say! It really is an amazing hotel and i'd recommend it to anyone! I took my boyfriend there for his birthday as we were going to the Oxo Tower for dinner and from the time we arrived we were smiling! The staff were fantastically helpful and we were even given a room upgrade to a studio which was beautiful!! The bed (and room in general) was huge! We booked directly through the hotel as you get breakfast in Bonds Restaurant doing it that way (which was also fab!!). The hotel is really near Bank staion and only about a 5 min walk from St Pauls so great location. We really did have a brilliant weekend and we didnt want to leave!
64,1293,"Jun 11 2007 	5-star in every respect and some!	I stayed at Threadneedles for one night on June 9th 2007 and this hotel exceeded my expectations in every respect. The location was excellent for me and my friend, as its a short (15 min) taxi ride to High Holborn (and shorter still to St. Pauls Cathedral), where you could get out and grab a tube to Covent Garden or even walk from Holborn to Covent Grden or Leicester Square. The hotel is also close for The Gherkin and Lloyds of London buildings, for those interested in modern architecture.The building is a former banking house, and the owners have refurbished it into a sleek, comfortable, modern yet welcoming style. There is lots of lovely walnut everywhere, and the rooms are really luxurious. We booked a deluxe double room but were delighted to be upgraded to room 106, the Shackleton Suite. The bed was huge, the bedlinen stylish and comfortable and it was very comfortable and quiet. The bathroom had a large bath and big shower, and lots of lovely Korres toiletries, as well as robes and fluffy towels. There was a sitting area with a flatscreen tv, wi-fi for internet connection and a CD/DVD player in the bedroom! The air con worked perfectly, and there was everything we could possibly need. You receive complimentary mineral water and a lighted candle on turn-down, and papers too.We found the staff to be very attentive (the front reception staff stand up when you first arrive and when you approach from the lifts...we felt like royalty, but it was clearly part of the hotel's approach to providing courteous and attentive service....other hotels should take note! Threadneedles Hotel has got it sussed!), friendly and accomodating.The wi-fi internet access on our t.v. didn't work, so they sent a porter immediately. When he couldn't fix it, they allowed me to have internet access from the reception office and did not charge me a cent.The breakfast was delicious - again, the attention to detail was excellent (the cooked breakfast was laid out beautifully on the plate and tasted great, so they got it right on presentation and quality.)I felt thoroughly spoilt staying here and while I accept that this is a 5-star hotel and costs quite a lot, if you are interested in service, quality and beautiful surroundings, as well as a pretty good location, I'd recommend this hotel very highly.A final footnote: I left a brand new pair of sunglasses behind, and they are posting them back to me! Anywhere else and you'd be lucky if they even bothered to look for them, and it would be more likely that they'd never be &quot;found&quot;. Try Threadneedles...its beyond compare in my opinion (and I've stayed at The Savoy, The Ritz and many other so-called 5-star hotels who don't come anywhere near it.)"
65,1293,"May 28 2007 	Fantastic!	I surprised my new husband with a night at Threadneedles. Due to the fact it was a holiday weekend, we got a great price for the delux king room. There was tons of space in the room, the bed was very comfy (though I would have have liked a king bed instead of the two twins pushed together). The bathroom was wonderful - a bath which was perfect for our bubble bath and the shower was huge! I was given the opportunity to help with a marketing survey and was given a bottle of Mumm for my trouble. It's a very customer driven hotel and I felt the warmth from the moment I entered until I left.It's easy to get around London from this hotel as you are surrounded by transportation options. It's one I would recommend to family and friends!"
66,1293,"May 28 2007 	Luxurious 	I stayed at the Threadneedles for one night at the weekend, on arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite, which was great news!The hotel is very tastefully decorated, &amp; the Armstrong suite was lovely, very luxurious with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Bathroom was also very nice with a separate bath &amp; shower &amp; Korres toiletries. There were 3 Tvs but unfortunately you have to pay to watch films &amp; there are no DVDs to borrow at reception as at other boutique hotels - but then I suppose it is primarily for business guests rather than tourists.The hotel is very well located near Bank tube station, with a very discreet entrance - we nearly walked past!We ordered room service but it wasn't really anything special for the price, nice enough though.All in all a very pleasant stay, I would definitely go back &amp; would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a bit of luxury and comfort while staying in London."
67,1293,"May 3 2007 	Absolutely Fantastic!	My fiance and I stayed at the Threadneedles hotel for the weekend of my birthday and I have to say it was fantastic. We got a bargain through london town website and saved over 200 on their standard rate.We booked a superior room and were gobsmacked upon entering, the room was stunning and had classical music playing in the background! We even had our own business cards saying we were in residence, with the direct dial to our room printed on!I was very impressed with the mini bar selection, ok it was a little pricey but not outragous.After our fab night out at the comedy store, we arrived back at the room to find our slippers laid out, an ice bucket, 2 glasses and a bottle of water - it was just what I needed!In the morning our paper arrived promptly and we went for breakfast. I recommend the power breakfast which is yummy!All in all I had a wonderful night here and would love to go back soon!"
68,1293,"Apr 21 2007 	Amazing Boutique Hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Threadneedles hotel the other weekend and stayed for 2 nights. I would really recommend this hotel; upon arrival we were greeted by two reception staff who informed us that we had a complimentary room upgrade. Once in the room we had all the usual plus a LCD TV in the bathroom with a pile of magazines including ones about London which we found really helpful.The hotel provided us with complimentary still water and ice every afternoon which was nice to come back to after sightseeing in the 80 degree heat.Be warned the hotel is in the City of London which totally closes down at the weekend, however the hotel is very close to the Bank tube stop which mean you can be in the centre of London within minutes! All in all I loved this hotel I will definitely stay here again when I return to London."
69,1293,"Apr 11 2007 	Loved it!	My boyfriend and I spent one night at The Threadneedles in January and had a wonderful time.Location: In the heart of London City this hotel is located 2mins walk from Bank Tube Station. Because of this, the hotel and surrounding area is very quiet at weekends but only a short distance from Covent Garden so this did not bother us. Lobby: Large spacious area with a beautiful dome in the middle. Seating area with lots of comfy chairs and tables and a self service bar for guests. Modern and traditional all rolled in to one. Rooms: Decent size for London although not exactly large. Bed was the comfiest I had ever slept in  sheets were really soft. Facilities included; fully stocked mini bar, TV/DVD player in room, mini plasma in the bathroom, magazines and toiletries, 24hr room service, Louis Vuitton Concierge Service, tea/coffee with a wide range of choices, lots of wardrobe space with dressing gowns and slippers, bottled water and fruit etc etc. Everything in the rooms was spotlessly clean. Bar &amp; Restaurant: As mentioned, London City area is very quiet at the weekend and for that reason the hotels Bonds Bar &amp; Restaurant is only opened for breakfast at weekends. The breakfast itself was incredibly fresh and with a choice of anything you could think of. Service: The service at The Threadneedles was impeccable and everything you would expect from a 5* hotel."
70,1293,"Apr 9 2007 	Unbelievable quality - understated luxury	I had to do a few days work in London over the Easter weekend and needed to be near my client location.Threadneedles was my second choice, with serviced apartments being unavailable.I was delighted to feel that from the moment I arrived, the hotel staff were tripping over themselves to please me.The surprisingly quiet foyer area is beautiful with a stunning dome worthy of spending half an hour with a drink to admire.The room was very comfortable and everything had been thought of (like the TV in the bathroom was at the perfect angle to watch in the bath).There are only two (hopefully constructive) criticisms I could make;1) The AC was very loud in the room.2) The mini bar prices were just a bit too steep.My stay was very pleasant and I would definitely stay there again, but even though the quality was excellent - I'm not sure I'd choose to pay the full weekly rate (as opposed to the lower weekend rate) then again maybe Im just tight."
71,1293,"Mar 16 2007 	Great boutique business hotel	I've been on several business trips to London, but the Threadneedles is one of my favorite business hotels. The room I had was on the 5th floor, it was spacious and modern, and the bathroom was beautiful. It had a large bathtub and a separate shower and great toiletries (Greek products). The bathroom also had a small flat screen tv, so it was nice to be able to watch tv while taking a relaxing bath. The hotel also provided a bottle of spring or sparkling water each night, which was such a nice touch. My room had a small balcony, which I unfortunately did not get to enjoy. There is also a great hotel/bar (Bonds) downstairs. This hotel is close to the Bank station, which was convenient. The only complaint I had was that my room was close to the Royal Exchange, above which was a steeple that had a clock bell that rang every hour...throughout the night! So it was a bit annoying to get woken up by this several times at night. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic boutique business hotel, and I hope to return."
72,1293,"Mar 11 2007	Fabulous boutique hotel in the City	This lovely hotel has everything. If you are looking for a weekend stay in London and don't mind being in the (quiet) City, then this is perfect. Beautifully decorated, stunning lobby with a stained glass cupola, it's the epitome of the trendy boutique hotel. But trendy doesn't mean frosty, as the staff are friendly and helpful. The gorgeous rooms have lots of enticing little extras. My husband was particularly taken with the overnight shoe polishing service as the soes came back on a tray w ith the toes wrapped in tissue paper. If you can get a good weekend rate (we paid 160 inc breakfast ex VAT) and don't mind being a little out of the way (albeit within spitting distance of Bank tube on the central line) then this is gem and way better than you'd get in the average west end tourist trap."
73,1293,"Mar 5 2007 	Beautiful rooms/ amenities and service just fair	The lobby and the rooms are modern, fresh, and really quite stunning. The amenities in the rooms themselves are also excellent--top notch products and even a lit bathtub candle during turnaround. Everything else, though, is substandard for a five-star hotel. Europeans may find the service acceptable, but this property couldn't even begin to compare to a typical Four Seasons or even a Ritz-Carlton. The service is lackluster and amateur. The hotel contains no gym; you have to trek several blocks away to a large, sweaty, old property (that costs 12 pounds). On the weekends, the service here is even worse; the restaurant is closed entirely and you're limited to an extremely limited room-service menu. Not to mention that The City of London is completely dead on the weekends."
74,1293,"Jan 4 2007 	Lovely stay couldnt be better	I booked a room at this hotel for 2 nights for New Years Eve 2006, and it was fairly easy to get to from Bank tube. I totally recommend this hotel, the room was large and clean. the service attentive but possibly a little too friendly (they greet u when you walk in the front door, which i found a little too much), but overall its a great hotel."
75,1293,"Dec 12 2006 	Excellent!	Stayed there for three days and enjoyed it tremendouslyThe hotel is situated in the business area, which means you have to take the Tube or a taxi if you want to go out in the evening. We ordered some food from the hotel one night since the restaurant in the hotel was closed and we were too tired to venture the journey into the centre. This was not a great culinary experience, but convenient. The friendly service and the great atmosphere of the place, however, greatly outweighed the bad burgers that they serve and we would highly recommend the place."
76,1293,Dec 3 2006 	Outstanding	Excellent hotel - slightly out of the way in the city but the quality made up for it. Fantastic design with some great touches including a small light by the bathroom so you know where you are going in the middle of the night!! Staff were very professional and helpful. Will definitely return - not cheap but great value for money.
77,1293,"Nov 27 2006 	Exceptional	What can I say... Just got back from a one night stay at Threadneedles, and can not stop wishing I was back there. I could live there!!I chose Threadneedles following a equally good stay in another hotel which is part of the Eton collection. It is a 2min walk from Bank tube station and about 5 min from Liverpool Street Station. The check in/out process was quick and easy. The room was absolute bliss, no faults at all. Would recommend it a thousand times over."
78,1293,"Nov 20 2006 	Great value in weekends	Ok, in many ways this is a 5 star hotel. Everything is 5 star except for what many others also says, it's to cold. The location is great for people who are in London for business in the City, not so great for others. But it's just next to the central line, so no big deal really. I stayed in 3 hotels in London for in total a week. This was the best in every way, except for this coldnes. The decoration is for me perfect. Even so I have some complaints that I as a norwegian (we don't like to complain) don't bother telling the staff, since they are minor and I didn't really care. But still this is a 5 star hotel, it should be perfect. The water would never keep the same temperature so you had to adjust all the time. The pressure was also unstable. It's also impossible to shower without spilling water on the floor. Not much but still. Also I'm quite anoid by having to pay for wireless internett, when the web page gave me the impression that it was free. I know when you can afford such a expensive place you shouldn't care and bla bla, but 6 pounds for an hour or 20 for one day is kind of crazy.I would reccomend it in the weekends, but would have chosen another hotel like Soho for the regular price."
79,1293,"Nov 1 2006 	A few problems.	My husband and I stayed here in October for two nights on a weekend. We were able to take advantage of the cheaper weekend rates. The room was on the small side, but the bed was very large, and really comfortable with lovely cotton sheets and lots of big soft cushions. The bathroom was very nice and everything was really clean.We had a couple of problems though. On our last morning we had to get up early (6.00am) to catch a flight to New York, and there was no hot water in the whole hotel. Staff offered to take us across to a nearby gym, but we did not have time so had a cold shower. There did not seem to be any great apologies for this inconvenience either. Also, we could not get Chanel 7 on the TV in the bedroom, but could on the TV in the bathroom. This was really annoying to my husband as he had to sit in the bathroom to watch the cricket! We rang Reception and someone came up to the room and said they would contact their supervisor. Nothing happened the entire time we were there, and no Chanel 7!On the second day were were there, we came back to our room at about 3.30pm as we were cold and wet, to find them still making up the room. This was annoying as we had to go down to reception and wait in our wet clothes!We did not eat in the restaurants as they are closed over the weekends. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel either, as it is quite expensive.After all that, I must admit that the bed was fantastic, so at last we got a good night's sleep!"
80,1293,"Oct 31 2006 	Does everything right but...	Threadneedles, in the heart of The City, won't disappoint -- yet still comes up a little short. Since my two-day stay there last week, I've been wondering why the visit wasn't satisfying. I'd guess this place lacks those intangibles that separate a perfectly fine hotel from a phenomenal one.To be fair, Threadneedles meets nearly every discriminating traveler's criteria. It is centrally located (close to the Bank of England, St. Paul's Cathedral and Bank tube station), well appointed (the lobby has a lovely sitting area perfect for afternoon tea), and features an upscale bar and restaurant (though the food looks better than it tastes). The rooms are nice, too, and rather larger by European standards. Atop the queen-sized bed, you'll find an abundance of pillows; an ironing board folds out as you open the closet door; and a CD player complements the large flat screen TV. The bathroom features both a tub and stall shower, as well as lots of towels, shampoos, bath gels and other supplies. But Threadneedles almost lacks sincerity. In fact, it seems as if it's marking off checklist boxes rather than earnestly working to ensure each guest has a pleasant stay. Plus, at nearly two dollars to the pound, these days even the finest of London hotels seem like extorion. While it was a particularly balmy autumn week while I was there, Threadneedles left me feeling somewhat cold."
81,1293,"Aug 14 2006 	2nd stay - even better than the last!!	Stayed here a few months ago - it's very quiet due at the weekend due to it's City location! Last time's stay was brilliant (review further down).This time we booked the same deal - 150 for an exec room. Got upgraded to a 2 roomed suite which excelled in comfort and style and the goodies (toiletries, quality magazines and a plasma screen to watch whilst in the bath) in the bathroom are fab! Fantastic quality rooms, outstanding service at reception (once you find the entrance to the hotel!). I really cannot fault this hotel in the slightest - all boutique hotels should take a visit and learn a few things!"
82,1293,Jul 16 2006	Lovely Hotel however......	Hotel is fabulous and extremley classy. Room was very tasteful and modern. Only problem I had was when checking In - I had booked the room on last minute and paid for the full amount of the room using my credit card. When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist asked for my credit card which i handed over thinking they were just taking the details in case we used room service etc. The receptionist then proceeded to put my credit card in the chip and pin machine at which point i informed him that i had already paid for the room and showed him my paperwork. He then went out to a back room and on his return quitely infomred me that he had charged 180 onto my card - there was not much of an apology and I was a bit confused how this happened as I had not actually entered my pin number. Anyway he said he would get on to the bank and resolve the matter. I havent checked with my bank yet as only just got back!! We will see as the receptionist did not fill be with confidence!!
83,1293,"Jul 9 2006	Overall very good - worth the money	Stayed at Threadneedles for a Friday night on the Romance Package (260 for Executive King room) - as a surprise birthday treat for my girlfriend.Hotel is easy enough to find although there are not many clues on the outside that it's a hotel (doesn't say hotel anywhere, frosted glass in the entrance doors). Imposing common areas (converted banking hall).Checkin was swift at the minimalist reception. The rate on the registration card was different (17.5% more) than the rate I booked online. But this came right by the time I checked out. They authorised my card for 350.The porter accompanied us up to the room and offered to show us how everything worked.The room was large (especially by London standards) and had all facilities as advertised. The Romance package included Champagne, chocolates - which were ready when we walked in. The inroom stereo/hifi had poor reception and only Classic FM was available. The TV in the bedroom was awkward (not intuitive) to use - as you had to navigate channels via the menu system, rather than using the familiar channel +/- buttons. The room's windows were filthy dirty and haven't been cleaned in months. The room was neat, tidy and clean. The bathroom is nicely done, lots of space, the LCD TV is a nice touch. Seperate shower and bath. Great imported Korres toiletries. Our cold water tap worked opposite way around to normal, and there wasn't much pressure in the hand basin. Good selection of &quot;posh&quot; magazines in the room and bathroom.I requested the turn down to occur whilst we were out for dinner (at Bankside, 2 streets away). We returned to the room, covered in rose petals (well, they're fabric ones!), the turn down, complimentary mineral water (although being served in a glass bottle could have been tap water!), a filled ice bucket, slippers and a carafe of bubble bath in the bathroom. The airconditioning was very efficient. We were supposed to have a scented candle as part of the romance package - but this never materialised.The bed (the king size was actually two base sets joined together) was very comfortable and the egyptian cotton linen is always great. The blackout curtains do a great job - however our room faced a side street and we were woken up by the muncipal refuse collection and some construction noise :( Also, the walls/doors appear to be quite thin and you can easily hear whats going on out in the passage and possibly even in adjoining rooms. Our room (214) was across from the entrance to the service lift - and were further disturbed by noises from there. Also, the plumbing makes a noise - anyone turning on a tap or flushing the toilet above, below or next to your room makes noise.The complimentary newspaper was delivered in a pouch hanging on the door overnight.Breakfast was included on the romance package - but was very confusing. They say &quot;breakfast is included&quot; but don't say which one. I asked at the restaurant but the staff didn't know what was included and I had to go back to reception to find out. They said &quot;everything is included&quot; - but that's not true either - as you have to choose a breakfast (not self service buffet). There's the Power (full english) breakfast, the Canadian (with pancakes and bacon) and the Continental (which is self service). There's also a range of a la carte items - but these are charged extra. Service was very good and attentive, and the food tasty. Thank goodness breakfast was included, as at 19 for a full english would be a rip off!!We requested a late check out and were allowed to stay until 2pm - a nice touch, especially on the weekend when they're quieter (I guess this is a business, weekday kind of hotel). They could do with more staff on reception, as on checkin and checkout I had to wait to be served.All in all, very good - and I recommend it."
84,1293,"Jun 2 2006	Great atmosphere!	We were there during the weekend, when everything in the proximity is closed. So you need to go with the Underground to get somewhere. However, the underground is not far from the hotel. The atmosphere is great, spacious and modern. Food is nice as well (breakfast!). We did miss internet: either wireless LAN or an internet facility/business centre like space. Woulkd book again for business, but no for holiday."
85,1293,"May 3 2006	Beautiful Hotel - Excellent Staff	The Threadneedles hotel is situated in the centre of London's financial area. We stayed here during the last weekend in april (bank holiday). It is a great locationa and very need the tube station Bank.The hotel is beautiful and very stylish. The decor is very tatseful and everything was of a very good quality.Rooms are very well equipped and the bathroom was gorgeous with huge windows letting in loads of light.The staff were excellent - so polite and courteous and welocming, a real credit to the company.We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to everyone. Someone else on here has mentioned the parking being a problem as the near by car park is expesive - we found a little road near by where parking was free at weekends - this was great and seemed very safe.The strange thing about this area is that as it is the financial district it is deserted at weekends - meaning none of the crowds and noise that you are subject to in other areas. This is something which we liked."
86,1293,"Apr 24 2006 	So very nearly there....	actually it's more of a 3.5. Initially felt this was a case of style over substance - lots of dosh spent on the interior design - lobby,rooms restaurant all marvellous. And the setting - 3 mins from Bank and in the heart of the City which makes for a splendid if slightly eerie weekend break. Gradually realised that this was slightly less to the place than met the eye:Air conditioning - was v quiet and worked, although in a very hot spell I would not expect it to be adequate. Bathroom - splendid - separate shower, excellent pressure.Beds/linens - fab. Best thing about the place - v comfy.Service - very good. Helpful, efficient. They light a candle in the bathroom at turndown and provide 'complimentary' water. Which did beg the question - at 300 per night could they not put bottles of still/fizzy in the room anyway. Perhaps dash out to Tesco (5 minutes away) or M&amp;S??Coffee - rombouts filters (not stocked up at turndown) and Twinings. But - and it's a big but in a hotel of this price - v poor soundproofing. You can hear every door close, people in the room above walking about, (which is not great at past midnight) and the neigbour's plumbing. A problem in conversions true, but they should have put some of the budget into sorting this out. Also the entertainment system is, ahem, basic. A JVC(!) hi fi and a TV with a few channels and a remote which didn't work unless you sat 3 feet away.All in all, at the many discount rates available - do not pay more than 150 incl tax at the weekend - it's OK for a slightly weird weekend or to be on the spot for a v early meeting in the area the following morning as I was. Business amenities (wi fi) seemed non existent which again seems odd in a hotel which is principally going to cater to financial types wheeling and dealing. It's a shame when there are so few boutique hotels in the area (perhaps that's the problem). Think I'll revert to Malmaison."
87,1293,"Apr 18 2006	Great modern hotel	We enjoyed the Easter weekend in this great modern boutique hotel. The staff were friendly and the rooms were comfortable and well furnished. The hotel seemed very quiet on the weekend, which was ideal for us. The room service we ordered one evening was very tasty.We had a problem with a noisy air-conditioner, but we moved (and upgraded) to another room with no fuss.Through no fault of the hotel, we were caught out with an unexpectedly high parking charge using the 'City of London' parking at London Wall. Saturday morning is not considered off peak and the parking costs went from 3 pounds per day for the rest of the bank holiday and weekend to 3 pounds per hour between 06:00 and 13:00 on the Saturday."
88,1293,"Apr 8 2006	Have a great stay	A very nice hotel in a great location (in the square mile) which gives tourist or business travellers a high level of security and comfort.My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Such a beautiful and well appointed room! Absolutely great value for money (discount online booking rates).Excluding the very mediocre service in the downstairs restaurant at breakfast time, the staff were courteous and attentive. This is the only aspect holding the Threadneedles establishment from getting an &quot;excellent&quot;. A wonderful building with a great sense of presence, I highly recommend the hotel for all business and pleasure travellers."
89,1293,"Mar 7 2006	Excellent and quiet	We stayed at the Threadneedles hotel for one night. We had the Armstrong suite, very smart, beautiful bathroom and plenty of space. I have seen all the sizes of rooms and do not think that any are small really but all are given the same care and attention to detail. Plenty of hangers, ironing board, hairdryer, showshine, bathroom products, tvs in every area, cd players. Wonderful large windows, fabulously comfy bed and the most impressive lobby possible.Oh and the breakfast was delicious, bacon sandwich, whilst v expensive, was possibly the best bacon sarnie ever tasted!!! Oh and fresh everything else!Do go, particuarily on a special offer as it's very good value at the weekend, during the week this place is very popular, location etc, but worth staying an extra night!"
90,1293,"Feb 27 2006	Excellent	Enjoyed a very nice stay at Threadneedles in the heart of the city. Everything was excellent and no real faults, other than it is expensive. However, by London standards it was value for money.I would certainly use this hotel again."
91,1293,"Feb 19 2006	Superb Experience	I took my girlfriend to theadneedles last weekend for an early valentine's present. I wasn't let down at all! Booked the room on their 'Romantic Weeked Package' so got the Executive King for a good price - the room was lovely, spacious, modern and clean. Only problem was the reception staff, which was quite a major problem at that. My reservation had not been logged so they did not know i was coming, which in turn meant that the little bonus points of the package were not put in place before we arrived. This didn't really matter, as the hotel wasn't busy so getting a room was of no problem, but had it been peak time this may have caused some concern.In other areas the reception staff were substandard. One gentleman had to count and re-count a cash payment 6 times before he both realised and believed i had paid enough. But the rooms more than made up for this, and by all means this is an amazing hotel!"
92,1293,"Nov 11 2005	Very nice one-night stay	Stayed over last weekend for one night having been at a late function, although we live just outside London it was great not to have to get home. As others mentioned, and as you'd expect in the City, it's *very* quiet at the weekend. For me, that's a plus and we did indeed get upgraded and the hotel seemed almost empty.Would recommend this hotel overall - very nicely furnished and fitted out, lovely big bathroom with LCDTV, very comfortable bed, fresh fruit and such. Really lovely and very helpful and efficient staff.Minus points: as others noted, we experienced long delays for room service food, but the food when it arrived was of a decent standard and the breakfast arrived on time and was very fresh and delicious. Also, the room wasn't huge... we were upgraded to a larger room but I wouldn't want to be in a basic one judging by the size of ours. Finally, parking is difficult. I'm familiar with this area and planned to park in the street a short walk away (normally easy on weekends after 1:30pm sat) but road closures and building work nearby put paid to that and we had to unload on double-yellows outside the hotel and park a couple of blocks away. In the rain. But I guess most people will arrive by cab so wouldn't be a problem.Really nice, comfortable, hotel. Recommend."
93,1293,"Oct 18 2005 	Not Ready for Prime Time	Threadneedles has promise, and a number of lovely features, but I had some significant problems during my stay. I would have considered returning to the hotel had there been an attempt to address them, but not only did they go unresolved during my stay, but the manager never even responded to a letter I sent him following my visit. Despite its great location for business travelers, refreshing decor and very nice details, it is not up to its (less conveniently located) competition in its price range. Among the problems:-- a scheduled wake-up call (rather crucial for jet-lagged business travelers) never arrived. -- the sunflower-head separate shower had nice water pressure at tepid temperatures, but a trickle at hotter temperatures. Despite promises to fix it, it was never fixed and upon another complaint (a day later), a staff member told me that I should just shower at a lower temperature and that I did not need to take a hot shower.-- no clocks anywhere in the room (except a tiny phone display in the separate living room)!! The staff told me it was a conscious management decision, and the hotel did not even keep any stocked to deliver on a guest's request. -- multiple maintenance/housekeeping problems: cordless phones (a nice feature, but only if they work) being dead and unchargeable on check-in; faucet knobs coming off in my hand; all lights (other than a tiny desk lamp) in the separate living room failing to work throughout the course of the first evening, despite the efforts of the sole member of the bell staff (again, the separate living room is very nice, but not useful if you can only sit there in the dark). -- unimpressive room service (stale pastries, mistakes in orders, etc.).The complete silence of management in response to the problems, both during my stay and in response to a follow-up letter, is perhaps the most surprising flaw. In the future, I'll just take a cab to The City and stay somewhere more focused on customer service."
94,1293,"Sep 5 2005	A lovely luxurious hotel	I loved this hotel, it is discrete, very plush and the staff were very polite and friendly. We were given a free upgrade to a suite which, although fairly small (as always, in central London) was really lovely, good amenities and they even light the candles for you in anticipation of your return after an evening out! The only advice I would give is to make a mental note of the address, or take a map with you - because none of the taxi drivers I used had heard of the hotel and took a long time to find it!"
95,1293,Aug 30 2005	Best Hotel for business	This is the best hotel for business travel to London. Very high standard. I was looking up hotels online for my trip when I came across TabletHotels. Not only did they have the best rates out there but the customer service person I dealt with was so knowledgeable about the hotels that I booked this in a matter of minutes. This was the most gratifying business trip I've ever been on. I will be coming back to Threadneedles Hotel.

1,1298,Great for the Money.	For what we paid to stay here for 6 of us we were happy. The staff were fine and friendly. Would stay again no problem at all. Our rooms were basic but clean and comfy - more towels available you just have to ask.Its a Travel Lodge not the Ritz people should know that before they book it !Short walk to Wetherspoons for full english 2.99 and it was fab !
2,1298,"A good base to put your head down	After booking this hotel and then reading reviewson this site, I was apprehensive to say the least about arriving here. First impressions weren't great, the road if you came in from the left was under a bridge and looked very seedy, however from the right was like any usual street. Wouldnt come under the bridge way at night. The windows were dirty and reception wasn't very attractive, however staff were very helpful and checked us in quickly. We had booked 3 rooms and were pleased with the condition and cleaniness of all 3 of them. Tea/coffee making facilities and a Flat screen TV. Clean white linen on the beds. The corridor did smell musty but the rooms didnt. We used the hotel to sleep in and nothing more than a place to dump our bags so ideal for us. Nearest tube 5 minutes walk awayWeatherspons for breakfast at the end of the road 2.99 for a full englishThis hotel is extremely basic but then thats what we expected, it was clean and staff were friendly. An ideal base for getting your head down at night."
3,1298,"Oct 20 2009 	Cheap and Cheerful	Just spent four nights here at a total cost of 127 for 2 people including a cooked all you can eat breakfast.It is a little off the beaten track and is best used as a base rather than a holiday destination in itself. It is in Zone One of the Underground system and served by a tube station 5 to 8 mins walk away at Aldgate East. Our room (room 108) on the first floor, whilst basic, was bright,modern and warm. However, the shower had a tendency to occasionally runs out of hot water and one of the reading lamps was broken - reported on day 1 but not fixed. The windows face the street below and open about six inches (for security). The twin beds are large and comfortable. Best choice of rooms are sited at the front of the hotel away from the noise of Fenchurch Street rail station at the rear. The bar area doubles as the breakfast room and is not that comfortable; however prices, by London standards are reasonable.There is a Wetherspoon's chain pub - The Goodmans Field - about a 8 minute walk away on Mansell Street which we used twice and found the food satisfactory.All in all a sound base for a business user or, like us, for a few days to take in a couple of shows. And finally, taxi fare from King's Cross - about 12. Don't use anything other than Black London Taxis (except the Tube) or believe me, you are likely to be asked for considerably more. We asked the Reception to get us a taxi. An unmarked vehicle arrived, took us on a mystery tour to King's Cross and asked for 22 !!! I gave him 10 and threatened to report him. He soon cleared off. That aside our London break was thoroughly enjoyable."
4,1298,"Oct 2 2009 	Good value hotel ideal for groups of lads	stayed here for two nights with a group of friends. there was one couple in the group and they hated this hotel mostly because they were afraid to walk to hotel at night from tube. the rest of us found the hotel ok. its in decent location about five minutes walk from tube. its clean, rooms are ok staff seemed friendly and its cheap. all in all i had no complaints about this hotel"
5,1298,"Sep 10 2009 	Not for Business stays..	The room was very clean, but it didn't make up for all the problems.In the room:No PhoneNo ClockNo hair dryerNo washcloth! Only 1 hand towel and 1 bath towel. 1 small bar of soap.No free internet. There was an option, 5 GBP per hour, 10 /day or 20 /week. Not cheap!Poor sound insulation. I was on the ground floor and could hear every toilet flush from all the rooms around mine. I had to sleep with the Bathroom door closed. People in the hall.. I could hardly tell if a knock at the door was my room or another.Main entrance is on an alley, in not very nice neighborhood. It's a bit disconcerning to head out or return in the evening on foot."
6,1298,"Sep 5 2009 	friendly staff.	This hotel very clean had lovely helpful staff. Ten minutes walk from the tube ,did not know which way to walk coming out from the tube . The only down side about the hotel was it was down a side street which is very dark walking down a night hotel layed out breakfast for us at 05.45 . Good size rooms no room with a view one side trains other building walls ."
7,1298,"Sep 2 2009 	a great located MOTEL	stayed 2 night at 26pounds sterling per night, booked on line 2 months ahead; at that price the best motel in London! had room 4 on ground floor - restricted view but quiet. this is a MOTEL [but no parking] and I've reviewed it as such. not much contact with staff but what I had was speedy and friendly."
8,1298,"Aug 25 2009 	Unhelpful unfair unsatisfactory....unlikely to use Travelodge again	If you think you have a room reserved here, beware. Overbooking is common practice - expect to be shipped on to another hotel upon arrival. Staff are incredibly unhelpful.The refund you're promised as part of their Terms and Conditions? Well you'll do well to get that out of them without going through a small claims court.Customer services responses must be mailed, for an answer within 10 working days - i've now waited 18 working days, have sent subsequent mails, and made 7 call back requests......And still i wait! What a joke of a company!"
9,1298,"Aug 18 2009 	Avoid	'Why oh why did'nt I just review the hotel on this website like I normally do.........oh well age and overconfidance I suppose. The previous reviewer has said it all really however I would like to add some comments. Beware of room 303 as the air con is not working and when I approached two seperate members of staf they gave me scripted answers such as ''travel lodge do not gaurentee air con in the room even though they have them but do provide fans'' too close to be anything other than to be scripted. Tired dirty bathrooms and not enough towels this hotel really is the ryan air of the hotel world, with that in mind I had every intention to speak my mind to reception when I was asked the obligatory question ''did you enjoy your stay'' but quite frankly took pity on the girl in reception as she was the same age as my daughter hence the rant here!! sorry. In short like the previous reviewer has stated there (must be) better hotels in London."
10,1298,"Jul 14 2009 	Don't stay here	I have stayed in many hotels in London, and so far this is the worst one.With Travel Lodge you tend to expect a bog-standard level of service and quality. However this hotel falls far below my expectations of Travel Lodge, which usually meet or even exceed my expectations.Location: Firstly, this hotel is not situated in close proximity to Aldgate East Tube Station.We arrived at the tube station expected the hotel to be visible, and walking down a few streets we realised we were rather lost! So we went into the Aldgate East Ibis Hotel to ask for directions, whom may I say where very friendly and happy to help. However it was then a further 15 minutes walk through a rather worryingly dark and quiet area of London. Thankfully I was not on own, as admittedly I would have feared for my safety.We gladly spotted the hotel, which is actually situated along a dark and miserable looking side street (or should I say 'alley way)... I think the street name gives a clue there: 'Chamber Street'.Appearance/Cleanliness: From the outside the hotel looks like a secure psychiatric unit, only distinguished by the familiar Travel Lodge sign. Inside the reception things looked up slightly, but only to the point of resembling a 'not so bad' hostel. As for the room, it was okay... bedding, linen and towels were all fine. No major complaints apart from the shower basin looking like it needed a good scrub and the window restricter being completely broken, which meant the window could be opened fully, wasn't a big deal for us - but certainly would be frowned upon by health and safety, and not good for anyone feeling suicidal or with children. Also the room seemed to lack double glazing certainly didn't aid sleep!Service: Our only real encounter with staff was when we arrived to check in, instead of a friendly welcome the response was &quot;Let me just finish checking my email, be with you in a few minutes&quot; *rolls eyes*. My colleague and I don't usually bother with breakfast but feeling peckish we decided to give it a go. The sign read &quot;Wait to be seated&quot; so we waited, and waited and waited, and after 10 minutes we gave up and helped ourself to some fruit and juice, which for me seemed the only edible things on offer.So to summarise, unless it's absolutely vital (or you are a health and safety inspector) do not stay here. There are much better and even cheaper hotels in Central London."
11,1298,Jul 1 2009 	Great Location - but expect some noise	Great stay and comfortable rooms. Unfortunately it was very hot so opened window but was backing on to a train line. Staff happily moved me to other side of hotel which helped a lot.
12,1298,"Jun 30 2009 	Great value	My friend and I stayed at the travelodge in room 110. It was much better in terms of decoration than any other travelodge I have stayed in previously, it was relatively modern and had a flat screen tv etc. The location was good a 5 minute walk from Aldgate east station and a 10 minute walk from London bridge. It is also about 10 minutes from St Katherine's dock and a Waitrose. The only problem was we couldn't figure out how to turn the air conditioning off. The room was really quiet for London."
13,1298,"Jun 2 2009 	Would make a good suicide clinic	What a horrible room! I was put in room 003 which can only be described as a dungeon, given the high up tiny windows. Air con didn't work, and it was too loud outside to have the tiny window open! I was also awoken by the cleaners directly opposite the room talking loudly first thing in the morning.When checking in I had to wait at reception for 5 minutes despite ringing the bell, although to be fair the food was good.General location was grotty, and the overall experience was simply depressing. Quite simply, it was an utter relief to get out of there."
14,1298,"May 10 2009 	Value for Money	This hotel is situated within the business district of London, only 5mins from the Gherkin. Algate East tube station is less than a 5min walk away. A walk to Tower Bridge took us around 15mins.The only low point i can think of is the fact that we struggled to find the hotel. After searching for 20mins we gave up and hopped in a black cab, bt even then the taxi driver had never heard of it. When we eventually found it, it was down a side street with nothing else on it. Hopefully this will not be a problem now as it has been open longer as it was only new when we stayed.I would definetly recommend as it has a great tube link to all major attractions etc."
15,1298,"May 1 2009 	You get what you pay for.........	Basic hotel but excellent value for money in London. Rooms clean although one of the toilets did leak on the morning we were leaving.Down sides were we had to pay 10 to book in early and 10 to book out late even though the rooms were available. Also can't leave luggage.Another problem is the railway although the trains do stop between midnight and 6am but the weekend we were staying they were carrying out maintenance work on the lines - we weren't warned of this and were woken by the sound of a pneumatic drill!Breakfast 7.50 but not exactly gourmet........If you are just using the hotel as base, it's a great location."
16,1298,"Apr 17 2009 	Good value for money	Really pleased to find a room anywhere in London for 32 a night (saver deal), so went for it and wasn't disappointed. I too was surprised to have to get to it through such a dodgy looking tunnel, and then to be told that the doors locked at 10pm at night and we'd need to ring reception (visible from entry doors) for entry, raised concerns about the area, but like previous reviewer we came in from the Leman Road end (East Aldgate tube is at the top of this road) and all was fine. I would have felt a bit apprehensive though if had been a lone female and would have caught a cab back.The two guys we met on Reception really friendly and helpful. No probs with heating in the room, worked perfectly. Didn't mind the sound of the trains at all, didn't disturb my sleep and I'm a light sleeper.Best thing of all - the bed. Really big, at least a king if not queen size and a seriously comfy mattress. Room was clean and cosy, funky artwork and decor/bedding different from usual travelodges - used to be a comfort inn until 18 months ago, which probably explains the difference. Flat screen TV.Overall great value for money as had a very comfy nights sleep and was fairly close to tube. Not the prettiest area, but that's never the attraction with travelodges! Would use again at this price."
17,1298,"Mar 3 2009 	Good for getting around London at a cheap price	The room was clean and comfortable the only problem was that the lift wasn't working and the heating wasn't either it was so warm in the room when we asked at reception and they opened up the window which was fine until we realised it opened out onto the railway tracks (which we were aware would be there) even that was fine until we couldn't work out how to shut the window so at 6 a.m., it was very noisy. This has not put us off as it was great value and we are actually going back there again in May for a couple of days at an even cheaper price (we will have to make sure that we can close the window this time if needed). It is so close to Liverpool Street and the tube we find we can get about London easily. Another benefit is that a Weatherspoons is just across the road so you know that you are going to get food and beer at a reasonable price."
18,1298,"Feb 24 2009 	Heating issues...	I stayed for three nights having business in London and this was literally two minutes walk from my offices.The check in was fine and the staff polite. The lift wasn't stopping at the reception level, so you had to lug your bags up and down stairs to the first floor - still wasn't fixed by the time I checked out despite notices assuring guests that a 'fault had been logged'.The room was spacious, bigger that average for a travelodge, the shower was powerful and the trains which pass outside the window whilst semi audible weren't really an issue.The only complaint I have is the heating/ventilation system. It is useless. You really do need to be a rocket scientist to fathom out the control panel and when you do it blows hot or cold for about 30 seconds then turns itself off, in fact it actually tripped out twice so I gave up. It wasn't as cold as it has been but still uncomfortably. Reception did oblige with an additional duvet, but as for a heater 'sorry we don't have them for health and safety reasons'.There is a brand new travelodge 5 mins from this one so I will probably try that one next time."
19,1298,"Jan 15 2009 	Good for the money	The Travelodge at Aldgate East is a pleasant cheap hotel to stay in within zone 1 of the tube system in London. The rooms are clean, it's fairly quiet and the staff are friendly and helpful. There's nothing outstanding about the hotel, but it's great value for money, particularly in such an expensive city. The alley that the entrance is in is safe enough, although I would avoid walking there alone at night. Would stay there again and would recommend."
20,1298,"Nov 25 2008 	Not recommended	I had to spend one night in the city and/or docklands area of London and was attracted by the Travelodge due to the very competative price.To be fair, I booked for single occupancy, so I got a single room - with a small single bed. The room was on the ground floor; had a small row of windows along the top of the outside wall and I just knew the pavement and the road were only yards from my bed.Everything was clean and the shower was very good, but I still would not repeat the experience. I'd rather pay a little bit extra to be a bit more cofortable."
21,1298,"Nov 4 2008 	Cold!	I have stayed in many Travelodges throughout the last 8 years or so, and I like them because of the good price-quality ratio and comfortable beds (with other hotels in this price range it's touch-and-go and I prefer to avoid back pain). We chose Travelodge Aldgate East for a weekend in London because of the 49 pounds/night offer, and its central location. I've read the reviews on Tripadvisor regarding the dark alleyway, and sure enough: it's there. It's fine during the day but at night we preferred to take the long way around and enter Chamber street from the other side. No biggie.The Travelodge wouldn't hold our bags for us until check-in time (we could do a GBP 10 early check-in, but we just wanted to drop two tiny bags so didn't do that) but again, that can be expected for this price.What WAS very annoying, is that the heating didn't work properly. It was turned off when we entered the room and it was 16 degrees inside. When turning the heat on (aiming at 22 degrees), it would only blow (it's a combined aircon/heating system) for about 15-30 seconds every 5 minutes. So, when not unbearably cold, we never got really comfortable in the room either. The temperature did not rise above 18 degrees at any point and we even left the heating on during the day while we were out! It was a bit of a chilly weekend, but temperatures didn't drop below 3 or 4 degrees. I don't even want to contemplate what happens if it starts freezing!Cutting costs is one thing, making people stay in uncomfortably cold rooms is another (and this is not the first Travelodge where I'm experiencing this)."
22,1298,"Sep 27 2008 	To stay or not to stay... that is the question !	After a long flight from Australia we arrived at this hotelat about 8pm. We went to check in an handed the reception staff our Expedia confirmation to be advised that they did not have a reservation for us and that the hotel had changed hands 6 months prior and was now a different name and company. The reception staff then checked a folder to see if she could find a record of our booking in the old hotels system. After about 2 hours standing in Recpetion the matter was still unresolved . Reception advised us that they did contact Expedia to advise of this and have had many customers arrive in the same sittuation as us without a booking due to Expedia not passing on the information and due to the time difference we were unable to phone Expedia.com.au to see why they had not advised us of the change and to se what has happened to our booking. The reception staff advised us that even tho they could see on our invoice that we had booked and paid that they could not honor the booking and we would have to pay to stay the night. As it was almost 10.30pm by this time we decided to just pay and sort it out the next day. Due to the time difference we had to set our alarm for 3am to phone Expedia in office hours. When we spoke to Expedia they advised us that the booking looked fine on their end - we advised that it was not fine on ours and something needed to e sorted. After 7 hours and 5expensive phonecalls to and from Expedia the problem was resolved and our money was refunded by the hotel for the previous night. Due to the trouble we had been in the hotel upgraded us free of charge which helped rectify the problem from the hotel side of things however we could not believe the amount of phonecalls we needed to make to Expedia to have this fixed. Surely 1 phonecall would solve it all - 7 is an absolute joke ! We then had another problem with Expedia.com.au as our flight had been cancelled and Expedia.com.au did not notify of this either via phone or email and still after 16 weeks we are still waiting for our $700 refund even tho we have phoned and emailed almost everyday ! We get some stupid excuse that the Air Belin rep that they usually deal with is on Annual Leave and they need to wait for her to return - what rubbish ! so a warning to you all - spend that tiny bit extra and book with an agent or with the hotel directly. Expedia.com.au are an absolute joke and should not be in business! The hotel itself was very clean and comfotable. Staff were pleasant. The location was good in the fact that it was a short walk to London Tower however and a big however, we believe this is the dodgy end of town. The hotel was in a dark alley which had many shady characters lerking around. On our way back to London we stayed in Kensingtone at a hotel called Abcone - It was in a fantastic part of London and was actually cheaper than this hotel here."
23,1298,"Aug 18 2008 	Points to take on board	Eight of us came down from Scotland for a long weekend, the weather was brilliant, we enjoyed everything we had booked, the hotel room was okay, but, the safe which would have been beneficial to us was not in use, in fact we were told that the safes were going to be taken out!!! It is a travel lodge, why would you think in taking them out, surely that would be a benefit to all travellers. The air conditiioning was out of order, again we were told that it was being taken out. It seems silly that two essential benefits are being disposed of. The locality of the lodge was down a dark alley under a bridge, not the best of situations in a dark night. We kept in a group for safety whenever we were going or coming in the evening. It is in a central area, near the railway station, and visitors attractions. The Geddes Party"
24,1298,"Aug 8 2008 	Very Satisfactory with a very nice price	This hotel exceeded our expectations by far, especially when judging by the price. We booked a triple room which was very spacious and was equipped with a safe, fridge, kettle, en-suite, trouser press, fan, hairdryer and television. The room was very spacious not like many of the other hotels that are on offer around london. The location of this hotel is fairly central, from out hotel room we could see the tall buildings of London city (the pickle thing etc!) Although some of the reviews on this website stated that it was a tough area, we never witnessed any of this, and we arrived back at hotel late in the evenings.On arrival, we were greeted by very friendly hotel staff, who were happy to store our bags for us as we had arrived well before our check in time. When we arrived back that evening there was no problems in re-locating the bags and checking-in. Room service was also very quick and friendly.The lobby is small, and has a few brochures and daily newspapers. Although we didn't dine in the restanuant during the duration of our stay, it looked very modern and comfortable. This is an absolutely top-notch hotel, and I would definately recommend it to friends. It was very clean, modern and friendly!"
25,1298,"Jul 6 2008 	Not bad for the price	Location was fantastic a 10 minute walk to tower bridge and the tower of london. The room was clean and modern but was very hot there was air conditioning but it only went down to a certain point and didn't seem to be working properly. Also it does state it on the website but we didn't notice it that the hotel is built by a railway track so if you are staying at the back of the hotel its very noisy, I wore earplugs and could still hear the trains. The staff were all lovely and really polite and helpfull and the cafe/resturant/bar was reasonablly priced. Overall it was cheap and very central and you get what you pay for really, I would stay again but get a room at the front away from the train noise."
26,1298,"Jun 25 2008	Not the best location	We chose this hotel as it was the cheapest Travelodge we could find in London.The hotel is in a good place for travel links into London - a short walk from Aldgate (Circle, Metropolitan) and Aldgate East (Hammersmith and City, District) Tube stations, and an even shorter walk to Tower Gateway and Tower Hill for the DLR, Circle and District Lines. We also easily walked to the hotel from Liverpool Street (Central, Circle, Metropolitan, Hammersmith and City, Mainline Rail).Within Aldgate, the hotel is not in the nicest area. When I first checked in, I did not feel comfortable at all on Chamber Street. The dark alleyway has been mentioned in previous reviews. However, as we quickly discovered, it is just as quick to get to and from the hotel via Leman Street, entering Chamber Street from the much brighter, open end. I would advise checking a map and directions thoroughly before going to the hotel - it is not exactly the easiest to find.The hotel is close to a train track. As my friend and I have lived close to a railway line for over twenty years, this did not bother us. As mentioned in previous reviews, you can hear the trains from the rooms. However, I would not advise asking for a room at the front of the hotel to escape the noise (as was also mentioned in a previous review). Although Chamber Street is far from being a main road, we were kept awake by the cars speeding down the road (and, unfortunately, it was far too warm to close the window to escape the noise).For our needs, the hotel was ideal. It was cheap (148 for two of us for three nights), and a good location for the links we needed (Tube, DLR and mainline from Liverpool Street). It was a clean and spacious room. The only problem we had with the hotel service was that we had no towels in the room upon first checking in. But a quick visit to reception and that's easily solved."
27,1298,"May 6 2008 	muggers paradise!	We recently decided to see the Tutankhamun exhibition in London so we made a weekend of it and booked online to stay in Travelodge Aldgate east. A one night stay for 39. Bargain!!The hotel is everything you would expect of Travelodge, Clean, spacious room, big bed, flat screen TV and superb all you can eat breakfast. And only a ten minute walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge.Now for the down side. The hotel is in Chamber Street which when you first walk into it can only be described as a muggers paradise! It runs alongside a Railway line and the hotel is the only modern building, the other business' being in the railway arches ( think the garage in Eastenders). Both ends of the street are as bad and to walk along it at night, as you have to do unless you take a taxi ,is not a pleasant experience.The other downside is the proximity of the railway. The side of the hotel we stayed in overlooked the tracks and although the trains do not run between midnight and 6am and then only trundle slowly past the noise is enough to ensure you will not get a lie in on your holiday!"
28,1298,"Apr 9 2008	Long way to go....	Stayed for 2 nights at end of March, we were told it had just opened, understatement... it was still being finished off builders everywhere, hanging cables and so on. Reception staff unhelpful and rude, denied we had a booking and then wouldn't let me use hotel phone to phone booking company. As we waited every single person who arrived had check-in difficulties. Also in a VERY dark street in slightly dodgy area at night (we got lost coming from the tube station and even the police didn't know where it was. Plenty of other better places...even in London"
29,1298,"Feb 10 2008 	Nice rooms	This hotel has been recently renovated, the rooms are small but lovely, we had a flat screen TV, and the bathroom had a decent size shower, but no bath.The position of this hotel is good, close to the Tower of London and a short walk from a couple of underground stops, however it is impossible to find, there are 2 Travelodge`s in the Aldgate area and we ended up at the wrong one. It is impossible to find if you have never been there before, it is down a bit of a dodgy road, but I think it looks worse than it is.The other major down side is there is no where to store your luggage when you check out of your room. We checked out at 12, and our train home was at 7. We have to get the tube to Liverpool Street train station and leave our luggage there.Now that I know where it is I would stay here again, for the price you wont get much better in Central London."
30,1298,"Jan 10 2008 	Now a travel lodge	We recently stayed at this hotel for a long weekend. Situated about 25 feet from main line railway and the Docklands Light Railway - ok if you're a train spotter! Trains operate from about 6 am to midnight. We booked as the Comfort Hotel but when we eventually found it, it had changed to a Travel Lodge - never stayed in a Travel Lodge before and would seriously think twice about it in the future. The place is in need of refurbishment - bedrooms and bathrooms were clean but carpets and mattresses were badly stained - had to ask every night for towels and milk for the tea/coffee tray. Breakfast was ok - cereals, toast and cooked - but usually had to wait for the trays to be refilled. Staff were pleasant and always supplied items straight away but got the feeling that things seemed a bit disorganised. The hotel is situated in a very run down street next to a 24 hour car wash - to get there you pass under a very dark railway bridge (even in daylight hours) the street is dimly lit and certainly would not recommend females to walk on their own at night. We did however find another route to avoid this - just over the road there is a walkway (Magdalen Passage) takes you to the next street - takes a minute or so longer but definitely worth the detour. There is the Minories Pub and Wetherspoons nearby which both do reasonably priced meals and the food is good. We chose this hotel because it was near to the attractions we were visiting i.e. Tower, Dungeon - but as the tube is only 5 mins walk we were able to get to other places very quickly. Probably wouldn't use again."
31,1298,"Jan 1 2008 	Very mixed feelings over this hotel.	I had very mixed feelings over this hotel. It was clean and new inside, with excellent quality bed, tv, chair, bathroom etc. Stylish and modern, with nice lighting and decoration.It was previously called the Comfort Inn, and I walked passed it twice before realising it had changed its name to a Travelodge.But there are too many buts for a good review. It is down a street that would be good on the Jack the Ripper tour. Very back-street-down-town, an alleyway where they wash your car by hand at one end, and rip off the wheels at the other (probably, late-night anyhow).I stayed 6 nights, and every night my doorkey didnt work. Come back, and well fix it for you. 6 times. Hmm. The people in front of me in the reception queue had their reservation lost. The guy behind me  his tv didnt work. The staff were friendly and helpful, but there were too many problems.Breakfast was minimalistic but edible. I tried it once, and then went to cafes in the area.A great location for the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the East End. But thats about all it has going for it. The Sleep Inn up the road is MUCH better.2 star out of 5 star."
32,1298,"Dec 12 2007 	Comfort Hotel........ now a Travelodge!	The Comfort Hotel Tower Bridge is in the process of being tranformed into a Travelodge (December 2007). When I stayed the hotel was clearly in the middle of its transformation, as checking in proved especially difficult, as well as slow, but I think this was because when I arrived they were changing over to the travelodge computer systems. I stayed on the fourth floor, the single room, contained a single bed, desk, wardrobe, and a small but adequate bathroom with a shower. The carpet in the room was very badly stained in a number of places, which was not ideal. My room at the rear of the hotel was also just above a train lines, and the trains finished going past at around midnight and started going past again at dawn, the train noise was rather loud, and made the building shudder at times. Although the trains and the carpets would put me off staying at the hotel again, I am sure if you had a room at the front of the building, with less stained carpets, this hotel would be a bargain in a very central location.One other point to mention, is that it is located down a very quiet and dark back street, so if you are to arrive back at the hotel late at night you may want to get a taxi back or walk with someone."
33,1298,"Oct 1 2007 	Excellent Value For Money	After reading reviews on Trip Advisor decided on this hotel. If you are visting the tower of London it is in an excellent position. It's a bit far East for the attractions of the West End but it is only 10 minutes on the tube (Tower Hill station, 4 minute walk). We were visiting the O2 stadium and it proved a pretty good location (15 minute walk to London Bridge station is the most direct route to the O2) .Room was spotless, bathroom was big and clean, there was a large sofa in our room and all the usual extras including WIFI access if you wanted it. recommend room 315 (think it was bigger than most). The rooms at the back of the hotel do overlook the railway lines but the double glazing is good and the noise didn't bother us at all. Breakfast was good and plentiful, the bar is in the breakfast area so has no real feel but is there if you want it.Wetherspoons at the end of the street is good and cheap as ever. Can recommend the &quot;Red Chilli&quot; indian restaurant at the other end of the street. Sunday buffet for 9.99 was excellent value and with really good friendly service!Enjoy London, Covent Garden is good but Camden Lock Market on a Sunday is a must! lots of character and feeling about the place!"
34,1298,"Aug 30 2007 	Clean cheap 	This hotel is located in an alley and not even the cab driver knew about it. From the outside looks bad, but the inside is very modern and the rooms are small (like every other room in the UK) but very stylish and clean. The bed is comfy and the washrooms are to the standard of any 4 (or even 5) star hotel.The location is great, 3 blocks away from a Tube station, 5 or 6 blocks away from the Tower of London and minutes away from the other side of the river. The restaurant is pretty pathetic, but who cares, eat out and enjoy the city. It is usually very well priced."
35,1298,"Jul 24 2007 	Great value.	I had to be in London very early for a two day conference, so decided to book a nearby hotel so I wasn't rushing in the morning. I paid 78 for a twin room on hotelshopuk.comVery very good value, I couldn't get anything else close for this price, so very pleased with that.The hotel was bright and very clean, the room was lovely as was the bathroom. Ate in the restaurant the night before which was fine, bit pricey but to be expected in London (I am from Yorkshire after all!). The breakfast was great too. Overall I really enjoyed my stay, the hotel provided everything I needed. One reservation - the location. It was very near tower bridge, the tube etc but the road it is down isn't exactly bustling with people. You have to walk under a dark railway bridge, which as a lone female, I didn't enjoy. But apart from that, very pleased."
36,1298,"May 20 2007	Enjoyed our stay	Nice hotel, friendly, helpful staff, Rooms very clean and comfortable. Only issue was that we did request adjoining, non-smoking rooms when we booked, neither of which were received. This didn't affect our impression of the hotel and the service. The train track is close to the hotel, but we didn't hear the trains passing inthe night as they pass slowly. Breakfast was great!"
37,1298,"May 3 2007 	Great Inside	I booked this hotel on Expedia for $88 Canadian last summer (double bed). For the price we couldn't do better. The room was very clean and modern. Housekeeping brought cookies and tea everyday which was nice. Even though train tracks were right outside our window we didn't hear anything. The windows don't open but there is air-conditioning. The only drawback is the location. It's out of the way and it takes quite a long ride on the tube to reach many shops and popular tourist destinations (except the Tower of London, of course!) There's not much nightlife around this part if that's what you're looking for. The hotel is about 5 minutes from the Tower Hill tube station if you walk fast. Trust me, at night you'll want to walk fast! It's pretty deserted around this part at night and it's quite obvious that people sleep under the bridge right next to the hotel."
38,1298,"Mar 27 2007 	A pleasent suprise.	I have had a few bad experiences of hotels in London so I hadn't hyped myself up for this one being much better. How I was pleasently suprised!The hotel does look like a converted office block from the outside, but we found it very easy to find and very welcoming once you get up to it, as it is has full glass front.The staff were nice enough, though we didn't ask for anything our whole trip, so they weren't really pushed ;)We had booked a double room, which was a good size, nice en suite, air con, good lightening, decor etc. Only problem (that I see people have mentioned before) is that we were looking right over the DLR. This line does not stop till about midnight so if you are a light sleeper this is not the place for you.Both me and my partner sleep like a log though, so we had no problems!Location was fine, short walk from the Tower Of London and an even shorter walk from Aldgate East station (zone 2) so everything was easily reached.Overall we had a very enjoyable trip, which this hotel helped towards.Cheers!"
