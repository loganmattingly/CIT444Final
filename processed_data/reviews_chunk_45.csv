286,1040,"Jan 1 2006	loved the hotel	Stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in December and loved it. As for the one review we didn't see fast food outlets on every corner (however there was a great Sainsbury's down the street) One and a half blocks away from Victoria Station one direction and several EXCELLENT restaurants the other direction down Wilton St. Ask Danny for recommendations. Rooms were a very nice size for a hotel in this price range in Europe. Americans should feel very comfortable in this hotel. Only downside, the internet service was out of order. The people were all very nice."
287,1040,"Dec 19 2005	Perfect Location Great Hotel!!	VIctoria Park Plaze is the perfect hotel. They are just steps to the Victoria Tube station. We were only a few stops from most of London's key points of interest.The hotel itself was very clean and hospitable. The bathrooms have been recently rennovated and are really something to look at! I took advantage of the large bathtub many nights! I would suggest getting the deal that includes breakfast in you room rate. It was really worth it. We would wake up in the morning, eat a wonderful meal, then off to our next adventure. I felt very comfortable at this hotel and will stay there the next time I am in London!"
288,1040,"Dec 15 2005	Park Plaza - the place to be	Stayed at the Park Plaza. Excellent location (1 block from Victoria Station for subway travel across the city and within walking range of Big Ben/London Eye/Westminister/Buckingham/several theaters, etc). Great staff-helpful and polite. Rooms and continental breakfast were also great. This was our first trip to Europe and I would highly recommend it and it will be our hotel choice when we go back to London."
289,1040,"Dec 12 2005 	Great hotel 	I recently stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza on business and was very impressed.The location was so convenient for both Victoria tube/train station and for walking to Westminster. As the location was so near Victoria I was a bit worried that the hotel may be a little worse for wear, however my worries were unfounded.The reception area was bright and breezy, with helpful attentive staff. The room was of a good size as was the bathroom, which was immaculate.I ate in the restaurant and have to say it was one of the best hotel meals I have had in a very long time. The Maitre D was hospitable, particularly as I arrived about 15 minutes before the official closing time and the food was delicious.All in all, I'd be very happy to stay at the Victoria Park Plaza again."
290,1040,"Nov 23 2005	Good service with spanking clean and comfortable room.	We had a three day stay at VPP earlier this month. I can only repeat how exceptionally helpful the staff was. Danny, on the concierge desk, was especially good and Stephan trolleyed our bags down to the station the day we checked out. Our room was large by London standards and very comfortable; the bath was also quite clean with a nice contemporary feel with its bowl as part of the glass surfaced counter. Did miss an purposeful indentation or a dish for slippery soap.I wish Id known that there was a US style electrical outlet although what good that would have done at that point is questionable since I usually leave my US appliances at home. Also agree that the breakfast was overpriced but arent they all? Got the reservations through the BA recs but didnt get a great bargain like earlier reviewers. We were there on Remembrance Day and I was impressed with how the staff came to a respectful and attentive stop for the two minutes of silence to mark those who have given their lives to keep Britain free. Very moving for this American where such observances are few and far between on such a massive scale."
291,1040,"Nov 22 2005	A pretty good deal	My wife and I just spent 5 nights at the VPP. Itslocated 2 blocks from Victoria Station although wegenerally took taxis. We signed up for the Executive Deal, a room that gives you access tothe Executive lounge. Included are free breakfast,eggs, bacon, smoked salmon and pastries. There isa machine that dispenses coffee, cappachino, etc but the quality is horrible. However in the lobby duringweekdays you can get these items at the coffee bar.Also fresh juices in the morning and meats and beerand wine in the evvenings are included.The service and staff was first rate.Even though the room description says free internetit is only for one hour each day and if you want ahi speed connection there is a surcharge..I told thestaff I thought this was cheesy.The room itself was clean and the bathroom was fine as well. I would stay here again. All in alla pretty good deal."
292,1040,"Nov 22 2005	Great Place To Stay	Just returned from a five night stay at the Victoria Park Plaza. Outstanding location and wonderful hotel. One block from Victoria Station - convenient to trains, buses and the Tube. Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Green Park/St. James Park.The room and bathroom are very large by London/European standards. It was very comfortable for two people. The room was also incredibly quiet - we never heard neighbors to our sides, above us, or people in the halls.The buffet breakfast is very well done with a great selection of fruits and cereals to balance out the cholesterol-fest of the full English breakfast. The staff was very professional. And this is going to sound odd, but the elevators were incredibly responsive - I don't think we waited more than 10 seconds for an elevator.We found what seems to be a great deal on British Air Holidays - $166/night including VAT &amp; breakfast. If you want a traditional English hotel, check out the highly rated B&amp;Bs. If you want a great place for business or pleasure, go to the Victoria Park Plaza!"
293,1040,"Nov 17 2005	Comfortable place to stay	The Park Place Victoria Hotel is a very nice and comfortable hotel. It is close to the Underground station which is a plus as we wanted to travel to London via the Underground from Hethrow airport. We aquired this hotel through Hotwire and were expecting the typical you will get the worst room that we have that we often get when purchasing through Hotwire, but we were pleased that the staff were willing to accomodiate our preferrences.The room was large - similar to USA hotels. The bathroom was very nice. The hotel was not in a beautiful location but we were not in London to just look out the window."
294,1040,"Nov 5 2005	It Was Exactly What We Needed	My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza for ten nights in October and could not have been more pleased. The best part was its proximity to Victoria Station which is where most of our days began although you can walk to many of the main attractions from this hotel. I would say one thing though - as travelers who had never been to London before, it would have been helpful to know on the day we arrived that going out the entrance next to the train platforms and turning right on to Wilton Rd. was a far more direct path to the hotel. As we arrived from Gatwick on the train and hauled our own luggage, we made an unnecessisarily long trip to the hotel by looking for Vauxhall Bridge Road. That said though, it was a two minute walk on all successive trips.As for the hotel itself, we were extremely pleased with our accommodations. The room was plenty big and the bathroom was very generous - a separate tub and roomy shower. As I frequently washed out things at night it was very convenient having a built in clothes line over the tub and things dried over night. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of closet and shelf space. As previous reviewers have commented, it is great having an ice machine on the floor and we bought our own soft drinks at the grocery across the street rather than pay the ridiculous mini-bar price. Others have criticized the high price of the breakfast and I agree entirely. We went to Marks &amp; Spencer and bought fresh scones and jam, bought fruit and juice at the grocery and used the in-room tea service to have a very inexpensive breakfast most mornings. As food was not our priority on this trip, we found several small restaurants in the neighborhood (Italian &amp; Indian)that were more than adequate. Nothing is perfect though. I never could figure out the in-room climate control. I like sleeping cold and could never figure out how to make the A/C work. As we were on the second floor, opening the window at night was very noisy. Fortunately I travel with a white noise machine so I was able to open the window and turn up the volume on my machine. My other gripe is the lousy armchair in the room. London has some of the most uncomfortable chairs in the entire world. This one was like sitting on a concrete slab. I would also suggest that you might bring a couple of small bars of soap with you if you are staying more than a night or two. I throw out my soaps when they get as small as what they provide so I will bring my own next time. Having a U.S. electrical outlet is great for charging batteries you may use such as for cameras. The staff were very helpful each time we needed something and fortunately we were able to check in as soon as we arrived from our flight instead of having to wait until 2:00. We have even received a nice letter from the hotel thanking us for filling out the comment card when we checked out. I suggested bigger soaps, instructions posted on using the climate control and proposed they get soap dishes for the sink instead of having us just plop the soap on the counter as they do. All in all it was a terrific place to stay. We booked through Orbitz and got a really great rate - less than $200 a night. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Of course there are more elegant hotels in London but for the price, location and ammenities, this hotel is hard to beat."
295,1040,"Nov 3 2005	Central location in london doesn't mean much!	My husband and I spent a total of three days at the Victoria Park Plaza. I was impressed with prior reviews of the hotel and decided it sounded great and I was also able to get a price of $150 a night which seemed reasonable. Every review raves about the great location... i would compare staying in Victoria to staying in Times Square in New York City. Very busy streets during the day, spookily empty streets at night, an excess of homeless sleeping in staircases, fast food restuarants everywhere, and souvenier shops on every corner. Just like Times Square the Victoria area is very central and therefore helpful in commuting around the city but, with the underground station, as long as you are in the central london area (which is very large), you can go everywhere easily. So you don't need to stay in Victoria. Don't get me wrong it was great to be a fifteen minute walk from Big Ben, or in the other direction Buckingham Palace. But because of the immediate area around the hotel I wanted to avoid going out at night locally. As for the hotel it was fine. The hotel was modernly styled and provided everything you would have needed, including international converted outlets (which really helps when you are bringing your own electronics). The rooms were pretty spacious, and very clean. Our room was on the sixth floor. We opened windows for some air circulation (because there didn't seem to be any air controls in the room)) and therefore we picked up alot of noise from the street. The staff was nice and the lounge/bar in the lobby wasn't a bad place for relaxing with a drink. I never ate dinner at the restaurant because I wanted to get out into London and see what it had to offer. One morning looking forward to a true English breakfast we went to the breakfast buffet, it was 17 pounds (a rip off), and the food was absolutely terrible. Walk two blocks to any pub to get better food! Overall, London was a great city. Maybe because I live in a city I should have stayed in a more residential area."
296,1040,"Oct 15 2005	Lovely London Hotel	My husband and I stayed at Victoria Park Plaza for 6 nignts in October 2005. We had a lovely experience at this hotel. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. We had a cozy King bed. Bathrooms are very adequate and shower has great water pressure. We had a problem with our sink draining, however,when staff informed, they quickly fixed it. We loved the close location to the tube and railway station. Very convenint if you fly into Gatwick, as the Gatwick express gets you to Victoria station in 30 minutues. Room has U.S. outlet in it. There is a hairdryer, iron, and ironing board provided. We also made use of the the in room safe. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning. Felt it was overpriced. Better off getting breakfast at close grocery stores, or McDonalds inside Victoria Station. Overall, we were very pleased with our experience and would defintely stay here again."
297,1040,"Oct 13 2005	A Great Find	My husband and I visited London for the first time last October with my cousin and her husband (also first time visitors). We had researched many hotels on the Internet and discovered the Victoria Park Plaza thru a British Airways ad. What a wonderful experience. Clean, clean, clean. Extremely helpful staff. Terrific rooms. And contrary to what we expected in London, the room temperature was actually warm. Location was the best. Would stay there again should we be fortunate enough to return to London - a very civilized city."
298,1040,"Oct 11 2005	Highly recommended	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in October 2005 based on the Tripadvisor reviews, and after getting a great deal through Zuji.The Hotel is very close to Victoria station (2 mins walk) and is in a fantastic location-within a short walking distance to Buckingham Palace (10 mins) and the Kensington Area (15mins). Of course, with Victoria Station so close, the tube is the perfect alternative to walking. If you're flying into Gatwick, this hotel becomes even more the perfect choice as the Gatwick express takes you to Victoria Station.The Hotel has a great lobby (and a bar and restuarant which we didnt try but looked to be fine) which has a very modern, contemporary, comfortable feel.... the reception staff are friendly and helpful.The room and bathroom we had was quite big by London standards and we slept like babies... a little bit of noise when the rubbish was being collected one morning... but really the room was very comfortable... very clean. The room and bathroom were decorated in a contemporary style, without being exceptional, (bathroom was very nice) but more than adequate.Breakfast was included, and whilst not being amazing, was sufficient and was probably better than anything you could find around the station.All in all, we would highly recommend the hotel and will stay again when we visit London."
299,1040,"Oct 10 2005	Lovely hotel no complaints	Stayed one night for a weekend break in London. Lovely hotel, clean, modern and good location. Tubes and trains are near, but if the weather is good its perfect for walking to Westminster, Buckingham palace and also close to two theatres, currently showing Billy Elliot and Saturday Night Fever.The staff were all friendly, and efficient from room maids, to waiters and front desk. The choice and quality of food for both continental and english at breakfast was second to none, and the dining atmosphere was also good. It was great to hear and speak with Canadian and American tourists who love the city, its history and haven't been put off visiting the capital.Our room was on the sixth floor and didn't have any traffic noise. The room was clean, and a nice place to relax after a sight seeing. Not a great view but you can't have it all !!Would definately recommend as a great city centre hotel."
300,1040,"Oct 8 2005	This hotel will NOT ruin your London experience...	We stayed in Victoria Park Plaza hotel for 6 nights at the end of September and there is only one thing I want to say - it will NOT ruin your London experience. Spacious modern rooms, normal size bathroom, clean, comfortable... Most importantly, it's only 2-5 minutes away from Victoria Underground(Subway)/Rail/Couch(Bus) Station... There are so many cafes and restaurants around, plus 2 supermarkets, so you may want to think twice before committing to their breakfast package. Overnight travelers - keep your exhaustion under control:)) - chances are you will not be able to check-in before 14:00 (2:00 pm) if you require either a non-smoking room or a room with the king bed or both."
301,1040,"Oct 3 2005	Perfectly predictable business hotel	I have been to London before and find hotels to often be in poor shape: small baths, iffy elevators and hot water, smoky rooms. On this trip (vacation), I was willing to pay a bit more for consistent quality and predictability. I got it and recommend this hotel for either business or leisure. Very close to Victoria train station and tube stop. Also close to a Marks and Spencer mini-grocery and Sainsbury large grocery - save $ and buy breakfast there. Very modern bathrooms - a rarity in London. I will stay here again."
302,1040,"Oct 2 2005	Finally a decent hotel in London	I just finished 2 days at this lovely hotel. I had a bad experience with London hotels this past summer, so I was looking for something that was affordable and pleasant. I got my money's worth from this hotel. Firstly, the hotel pictures are exactly as the hotel is, including the standard room (which is called a superior room). The hotel is very modern/contemporary. We got a standard room which was quite spacious. Bathroom was very nice with lots of glass so it looked very clean. Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. And very importantly, the hotel was a 2 minute walk from the Victoria station...excellent. All in all, this is a lovely hotel and I would absolutely recommend this choice to anyone who is looking for a good deal and good value."
303,1040,"Sep 26 2005	Great Stay in a Modernly designed London Hotel	After reading all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor, I stayed with my wife at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel between 9/5-9/8 2005 and we were very pleased. Given the weak dollar to Pound exchange rate, we thought the hotel was a very good value considering how much 3+ star hotel rooms were going for in London. The hotel is situated about 5 minutes from Victoria Station, which is a huge underground and bus/train terminal. It is very convenient to get to from Heathrow airport from the underground and it will save you quite a bit of money versus taking a taxi. Although the area is mostly filled with commuters and business workers and does not have a bustling nightlife, there are some nearby restaurants and grocery stores and we found the area to be very safe even late at night. Central London, Trafalgar square and the theatre district is located North of Victoria Station and is very easily accessible with a 10-15 minute underground ride. (We decided to walk one night back from the theatre district which took about 30 minutes.) The hotel is very clean with a minimalist modern design. The room (ours was on the 7th floor) and the bathroom was spotless and decent sized for Europe. As some other reviewers have noted, there are various outlets incuding 110/Europe, etc. When we booked throuhg the British Air website, it also included a complimentary Continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was a very nice touch. Although most of the guests seemed to be on business travel, I would recommend this hotel for business and pleasure travel alike. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future"
304,1040,"Sep 19 2005	Great Hotel Great Location	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in the middle of September for four nights. Although I chose to wait for a room with a king bed, the hotel allowed me to use to gym to freshen up after my flight, then held my luggage until I returned at 13:00 to check in. I received a large, king bed, very clean, interior room. The decor was simple and modern and the bathroom was a great size with a large tub/shower. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The only wear I noticed in the hotel was the hallway carpets. There are 3 types of outlets near the desk in the room allowing for UK, EU and US plug types. Female travelers should take note that electrical outlets are not provided in European bathrooms. I had to dry and curl my hair without a mirror during my trip. The location was just next to the Victoria tube/train station which I found to be very convenient. There were also two theaters (currently showing Billy Elliott and Saturday night Fever) very nearby. As a solo female traveler, I felt quite safe in th hotel and the location."
305,1040,"Sep 17 2005	Great location good hotel	My husband and I spent 5 days at the Park Plaza. Overall, the experience was good. The location can't be beat since it's a couple minutes walk to the tube station. It's not necessarily a cute area since it's sort of touristy and has pretty much what you'd expect from a location around a train station. The room was large and clean and we had a king size bed. The only problem we had was with the safe in the room. It wasn't working and after we complained they send someone to fix it. He never got it working though so we couldn't use it the entire time. Not too big of a deal, just an annoyance. We found the lobby very full of business men so we never went to the bar/restaurant."
306,1040,"Sep 16 2005	Excellent hotel perfect location	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for 4 nights (9/1-9/5/05). The hotel is a short 2-block walk to Victoria Train Station - a perfect location. We had no problems walking with our luggage to/from the train (Gatwick Airport/Victoria Station). The room was very large and clean, with a large oversized bathroom. We took advantage of the breakfast, evening wine and one hour free internet access - it was well worth the extra price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. During our stay, the weather was perfect and we walked to all the sights. If we did need directions to our hotel, we simply looked for the street signs pointing to Victoria Station. We also felt very safe in this neighborhood. Because of the location, good service, great room and fair price, I doubt that I would ever stay anyone else but the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel. Staying here was the perfect place and helped to make our trip delightful."
307,1040,Sep 12 2005	Great value for money	Very efficient and yet friendly helpful Staff; good hot freshly cooked food with great choice and plenty of fresh fruit; clean comfortable beds and wonderful value for money.
308,1040,"Sep 4 2005	A+ place to stay	I'd like to start off with saying this hotel is an execellent value!We arrived (quite tired from an overnight flight from the US) at around 1:00 pm, our room was ready.The front desk staff from day one, was very friendly &amp; helpful.In fact during our week long stay, I'd say the front desk was overstaffed, a good thing really.The lobby and all public areas are kept spotless, a very modern hotel.Our standard room came with the following:Iron &amp; board-US elect outlet-hair dryer-in room safe with programmable digital comination (Very handy &amp; free to use) mini bar (did not use) 3 phones (1 in the bathroom) wall mounted make-up mirror in bathroom, bedding and room furniture all in tip top like brand new shape.I have to say the bathrooms are VERY modern as well, the bathtub was enormous both is depth and length. Always plenty of water pressure and hot water. Ice machine on every floor comes in handy too.Gym and sauna-steam room with showers as well.Victoria rail-tube station is less than a 4 min walk away, this area is very safe no matter what time of day or night.Some nice restaurants, and an upscale deluxe supermarket very close."
309,1040,"Aug 31 2005	Great hotel friendly staff	I stayed at the Victoria Plaza over the August bank holiday weekend and enjoyed it thoroughly. The hotel is very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff were very helpful and always happy to help.The location is perfect for exploring the city with Victoria station just round the corner (buses, trains and taxis on your doorstep.If I had any complaint it would have to be the slightly silly prices at the hotel bar.I will certainly be staying here again."
310,1040,"Aug 30 2005	Great hotel for shows in london	We have just returned from a weekend away to London, mainly to see the show Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace theatre, nr Victoria Station. We chose to stay at the Victoria Park Plaza, and after reading many other hotels reviews, we were extremely pleased with our choice.The hotel was modern, clean, sparkly and almost futuristic. Very nice indeed. The reception staff assisted promptly, and friendly towards us.No hassle check in, and straight to a lovely room. Gorgeous queen size bed which was so comfortable, lovely decor, large spacious sitting area too. Great bathroom, everything in the room, was over our expectations.Only one, negative, the traffic noise, slightly was annoying, so request a quiet room.Breakfast was self service, full english, with other choices too. Much to choose from, again, well freindly and lovely laid out restaurant.The location was superb for the theatres at Victoria. 2 minutes if that, from the Victoria Station, and only 4-5 mins walk easy to the theatres and many restaurants to choose from.We would definately choose this hotel again, in future.The show, billy elliot, is fantastic, go see it . its superb.We will go again and again i'm certain."
311,1040,"Aug 21 2005	absolutely fab!!	First of all what a great location. Just yards from vicotia bus and train station. Hotel itself was very nice. Staff were very helpful and the maid service was great. Stayed for three nights and really enjoyed it. Breakfast was really good, both full english and continental. I would definately advise anyone to stay here because me myself, well i'm very fussy but was very impressed. So well done to all the staff. See you next year, and THANKS!!!!!"
312,1040,"Aug 16 2005	Great hotel great location great staff	My wife and I picked this hotel through a Dutch website and got an excellent deal. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greated as though we were regular guests, in fact it was the first time we ever stayed there...The room was big, certainly for London standards and the bathroom was simply excellent. We had a room on the 7th floor on the street side of the hotel. The noice is a bit of a problem if you like to sleep with the window open. If so, ask a room that looks out over a small courtyard (inside of the hotel). The hotel is very modern, with nice art and even though the outside may not be very appealing, the inside is just great. There are also some theaters close by and the tube is nearby too (Victoria Station). Buckingham Palace is walking distance.We go to London quite often and we know already that we will return to this hotel.Go for an English Breakfast if you can, its simply excellent and beatifully prepared."
313,1040,"Aug 15 2005	Excellent quiet modern nice well located hotel	Just returned from a three day trip to London. Victoria Park Plaza was an excellent choice. The room was great and the bathroom was modern, high tech and roomy. Easily accessible to all the sites. We walked to the hotel from the train station. Public buses were also located there, so it made travel convenient. Though we ended up walking nearly everywhere. Thre were many restaurants and grocery stores right around the hotel. The service was great. There were sometimes as many as 5 staff at the front desk eagerly awaiting us, to answer questions, book theatre tickets, provide directions, or call us a cab. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
314,1040,"Aug 9 2005	Lovely Hotel Great Location	Victoria Park Plaza is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location. When we arrived, we were offered an &quot;executive&quot; package for 25 pounds extra per day that included a lavish breakfast and access to a comfortable lounge where cold drinks, wine and snacks were served every evening, a very good deal considering how expensive London is for Americans right now. The only problem we experienced was that the refreshments were not always replenished on a timely basis. But once the staff was notified the situation was quickly rectified. Service is, on the whole, a little inconsistent (we had to request a promised &quot;welcome tray&quot;; one morning we were sent to the Executive Lounge for breakfast when the dining room was too crowded). However, I will without a doubt stay at this hotel again and I will recommend it to friends."
315,1040,"Aug 8 2005	Excellent choice	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for 4 nights and found it to be excellent. It was modern and well priced, with a large room and comfortable bed, and good service. You can even walk to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben (or jump on the Tube if you prefer).The location is top notch - walking distance from Victoria Station. We caught the Bus from Luton Airport to the station (National Express) and it was easy. We then took the Gatwick Express train from Victoria for our flight out.We had a delay with our flight and unfortunately ended up at the Victoria Thistle Hotel as the Plaza was booked up. The Victoria Thistle was around the corned from the Victoria Park Plaza, and by comparison the Thistle was old, poor service, horrid bed and more expensive just to rub it in!We booked the Park Plaza on the British Airways Holidays website, but I think the Hotel has a price guarantee to beat any other offers, so it's worth checking it out. I wouldn't book a hotel on the BA Holidays phone service though - thats how we ended up at the Thistle which we really hated!We would stay at the Victoria Park Plaza again and recommend it if you want to stay in London."
316,1040,"Aug 4 2005	First Class Hotel With A Great Location	Our family arrived at the Heathrow Airport just a few hours after the bombing on July 7. Initially we planned to take the coach to Victoria, but the bus service was running about 90 minutes behind schedule. With the closure of the subway system, we decided to take the train(Heathrow Express) to Paddington station, then took a taxi to the hotel. It was a big relief once we got there. Check-in was fast, and our executive studio was ready. The room was big and clean, and the king size bed was very comfortable. The bath room was well-equipped and very modern. Service was excellent all around. With the room upgrade, the English beaakfast was included. The food was good and plenty of fruits. The servers in the restaurant were verry friendly and helpful. Danny at the Concierge was extremely helpful. Before we left, I told him that I'd read some very nice things about him on this bulletin board. He was happy to hear that people do appreciate good service.Location for this hotel is perfect, just 2 min walk to Victoria station and 10 min walk to the Coach station. There is a mini market(Sainsbury Local) just 5 minutes away. And yes, there is a Starbuck inside the Victoria station too.We plan to go back in a year or two, and we will definitely stay at this hotel again. By the way, British Airways Holiday's website offers very competitive rate and easy to book."
317,1040,"Jul 29 2005	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights the last week of June/first week of July 2005. The location was wonderful, one block from Victoria Station and with many restaurants and a nice grocery market within a block the other direction. The hotel staff was very helpful and accommodating. They were very pleasant to deal with and fixed any problem immediately. (The room keys seemed to stop working every day). There was some street noise from traffic and sirens at night, but not too much. The breakfast was OK, better at the restaurant than in the Executive Lounge. However, it is only worth it if you get it as part of a package or Executive upgrade. The hotel itself is ultra-modern and comfortable, nice rooms and nice bathrooms. We would definitely stay here again."
318,1040,Jul 27 2005	Absolutely Fabulous!!	Wonderful hotel. Staff most attentive to every detail - and friendly.Highly recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a great experience.Monica and Alison (Grandaugher )Day
319,1040,"Jul 25 2005	Loved the Victoria Park Plaza	The time that I spent at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel was very relaxing. My trip to London was 12 July thru 18 July. After a very long over night flight from San Francisco all I wanted to do was get my shoes off and relax before exploring the city of London. Upon arrival at the hotel the room was ready and waiting. This was during the time after the London Bombing. With these event going on the staff was very helpful and friendly offering advice on the ways to get around town due to closures and advice on places to see and to have some meals.The room was comfortable and always cleaned to the best of standards.  I discovered upon arrival back at home that I have forgotten my dental nightguard in the bathroom and when I contacted the Victoria Park Plaza, they returned it by mail to me, and for that I am grateful. I would highly recommend to anyone to stay at the Victoria Park PLaza"
320,1040,"Jul 23 2005	Loved the Park Plaza	My husband &amp; I stayed in the victoria Park Plaza for just one night on 21st July 2005. We booked it through the 'price check' on trip advisor after reading all the other positive reviews. We both enjoyed our stay and we were really impressed with the standard of accommodation. We paid an extra 25 on arrival at the hotel which apparently upgraded our room. For this we got a full english breakfast, drinks in the executive lounge between 6pm - 8pm and upgraded toiletries. For 25 we thought it was quite good value. We have stayed at a few hotels in London and found this the best that we've stayed in for a 4star hotel. It's in a fantastic location, the staff are helpful and courteous, the food was good (dinner in the restaurant reasonably priced) and the room was clean, spacious and nicely decorated. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definately use it again. Jennie, Kent."
321,1040,Jul 21 2005	Here when the olympics and the bombs happened!!!!!	We arrived on the 4th of july..around 11:00 a.m. Got a room right away(king) very nice ..loved the way lights wouldn't work without doorkey in slot...??? I brought my own washcloths because I had read ahead that they weren't furnished..yep!!! No plug-ins in bathroom....I had to curl my hair at the desk..no mirror ..so Husband had to tell me..Yikes!!! The bed was comfy..room very clean..(shower leaked every time but loved the ambiance of it....)I will recommend this hotel to everyone!!! Staff was helpful and pleasant..never really needed them till check-out time..Staff at breakfast were very courteous also. We just had the Continental Bfk. and it was plentiful for us......So a few flaws but I really will stay here again....Now about our trip...Luckily we saw everything we wanted to see the first 2 days.because the bombs went off on the 7th..We were just going down to the subway when the police stopped us and wouldn't let anyone down...I have never seen so many police in my life and police cars..ironically I never felt in danger..I guess I was stunned because this has never hit me this close before.. I was worried that we couldn't get homethe next day but everything worked out...WE enjoyed all the sights and hope to visit again...we would like to see the country side next time....thanks London for letting us visit...Oh!! the night of the bombing We were sleeping and we received a phone call from British Airways confirming that we were okay..I booked through them for our hotel but we flew Virgin Atlantic... I really think that was super of them to CARE!!!!!!!! Again WE loved the location of the hotel and it was convenient to everything..We could walk every where and We did......It was quiet (we were on 5th floor)looking at alley but we didn't care ..we weren't ever there...Thanks to all at VPP!!!!
322,1040,"Jul 18 2005	Great Value	Victoria Park Plaza provides great value contemporary rooms in a very convenient location in central London. The room was a good size, was well equipped and clean. It is possible to walk to major London sights within 10-15 minutes but it you don't want to walk to tube is 2 minutes away. Service was okay. Photos on the web site are accurate. I would be very happy to stay there again."
323,1040,"Jun 29 2005	Great hotel choice	Just spent four nights at this hotel, and can honestly say it has been the best London hotel I've stayed in. I go to London every year, meet up with friends and family. The Victoria Park Plaza Hotel is certainly one we will go back to. So comfortable, and the staff are really friendly. We had an executive room, and the use of the executive lounge - great informal breakfast setting - lovely food choices, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, including danish pastries and fresh fruit. You can also go in the lounge during the day, grab a cup of coffee from the machine. From 6 - 8 it is open for nibbles and wine (a couple of glasses just to get you in the mood for the evenin). Bar staff friendly and made you welcome. The room was large and very comfortable - lovely decor and had everything you could ask for. The bathroom was huge with a bath/shower and also a separate shower cubicle - very modern. Altogether great value for money. Will definitely be back next year."
324,1040,"Jun 28 2005	The flawless Park Plaza	My mother and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel in Central London for three nights this summer (2005), and I can honestly say that it was the best stay we've had in London, having visited the city two times before this year's trip. We upgraded our room to a studio room, including such amenities as immediate check-in (noon), english breakfast, daily newspaper, a large and comfortable room, late check-out option etc. etc.Everything in our room was working properly, the cleaning was good, and the beds were comfortable. Each time we contacted the front desk, we were given sufficient information/explanation, accompanied by patience and a smile. The breakfast was impeccable, and the Executive Lounge, where we retired for snacks, refreshments and a range of the day's newspapers late in the afternoon, was an excellent place of relaxation after a day of sightseeing.I hope to return soon - I'll recommend the Victoria Park Plaza!"
325,1040,"Jun 19 2005 	Very good London hotel	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza on June 15th. I was at a conference at the hotel - which has very good conferencing facilities.The lobby is spacious, light and very stylish, which describes the whole hotel. I love the modern art that's all over the place, including prints, sculpture etc. and also good flower arrangements. Had a good meal from room service and a nice breakfast in the executive lounge. Bedrooms are minimalist but the bed is very comfortable and the pillows excellent. The rooms are calming and whilst I didn't have a great view - looking over the inner courtyard - it was completely silent. Very nice bathrooms. Staff were all very pleasant. Location very convenient as you can walk from Victoria Station in no time. A very accomplished 4 star deluxe London hotel. Good deals can be found for this property. I am looking forward to trying the new hotel in the chain - the Riverbank Park Plaza."
326,1040,"Jun 19 2005	Surprise Surprise!	Upon arriving in London after an overnight trip from America, we just wanted to get shed of our bags and get our feet on the ground. We arrived way before checkin time and they graciously took our bags and assured us that if we returned around 1:30 our room would be ready and it was! This hotel was just what we were looking for and as we travel to London at least 2 times a year, the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel will be our hotel of choice."
327,1040,"Jun 16 2005	Great Hotel	Excellent hotel, in the top 3 we have stayed at in the world.Bathroom/ bedroom spacious and extremely comfortable.Food was excellent, as was locationAll in all lovely holiday in a superb hotel."
328,1040,"Jun 15 2005	Great place 	We stayed here during Christmas and it was wonderful! We had our 14 year old son along with a friend who had never been to London. The rooms were great , get the excecutive deal for breakfast and hor deurves at night. It's well worth the money and the breakfasts are alone wonderful. Location is great right near Victoria Station, within walking distance to the palace and a great take away cheap Indian restaurant at the corner along with a great Italian restaurant down the road. No doubt we'll stay here again."
329,1040,"Jun 14 2005	Great location great hotel	The Victoria Park Plaza is very modern and clean. The bathroom, in particular, was quite unique and had a useful fog-free mirror (although I didn't understand the 1/4 length shower door). The view from our room wasn't very good, but that wasn't a big deal to us.The location is great--very close to Big Ben, Parliament, the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace. Withing walking distance of many more sites (e.g., Trafalgar square). Also, just a 1/2 block from a main tube station which is key to navigating London. Many restaurants and pubs close by too.Overall, a great place to stay in London if you're willing to pay a little more."
330,1040,"Jun 12 2005	In the words of Tina Turner - Simply the Best	Never have I stayed in a hotel where everyone from the cleaners to the concierge greet you. It didn't matter where we were in the Hotel, the whole staff were wonderful and ALWAYS greeted you in a warm friendly manner. This really stood out to us as we have never encountered this anywhere else before and it was really appreciated. You felt welcomed and appreciated for choosing to stay with them. The Concierge's were a wealth of information and only too happy to help, suggest and advise. Danny in particular went out of his way to assist. Breakfast was a mass of colour and selection and it was fresh and well presented. Tea and coffee was constant served by friendly staff. Rooms were well presented, warm and inviting. Location was sensational. Train station, bus station on one corner, Internet access on another corner, great little curry house on another corner and general store opposite. Restaurant staff were courteous and friendly and meals were served quickly. Amenities were good, particularly business centre, even though we weren't there to use that, I will be recommending it for a conference centre to a number of people. Well laid out. We will be returning next year and I won't be spending any time looking for somewhere to stay. This will be our choice without question. I hope you too, if you choose here find it as good as what we did. And if not...tell them...I am confident that they would want nothing more to rectify any matter to meet customer satisfaction."
331,1040,"Jun 12 2005	Simply the Best	My wife and I spent three nights at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel and we were impressed from the moment we checked in. We had booked 'room only' and were given the opportunity to take the 'executive package' which gave us breakfast each morning, which could be taken in the 'executive lounge'. This package also included complimentary wines, beers, coffee, tea and canapes from 6 - 8pm each evening, again in the executive lounge. The lounge was also available to you during the day when coffee and tea were available. Whilst unpacking our bags in our room a maid arrived with a complimentary tray of 'goodies' including chocolates,biscuits, platter of fresh fruit, slippers, bathrobe,bottled waters etc - all this for paying an extra 25 per day FOR THE BOTH OF US. We thought this was excellent value indeed.Our room was spacious with a king size bed and the bathroom was well equipped.The decor is very modern throughout the hotel. We found all the staff to be most welcoming - always greeting you when you met them throughout the hotel.We would CERTAINLY recommend this hotel to anyone spending time in London. It is centrally placed, within a five minute walk of Victoria train and Underground station. We will definately stay here again when we visit London."
332,1040,"Jun 12 2005 	Good value hotel in convenient location	I travel to London regularly on business and have stayed in many different hotels. The Vicky Park Plaza is one of my favourites. It's consistently good -staff are helpful and friendly, room service standards are high. It's clean and modern - it might be a bit bland for some but you know you are going to get a nice, comfortable room. Quite comfy beds. Nice modern bathrooms of a reasonable size. Ask for a quiet room where you can't hear the traffic and you'll get a good night's sleep! Has a leisure club in basement. Breakfast is good - lots of variety. Very handy for Victoria Station and Tube. Lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance."
333,1040,"Jun 9 2005	Excellent value!	We stayed at the VPP for 5 nights near the end of May, 2005. We booked a package thru British Air and found the hotel to be a fantastic value! Things that make this hotel : Location, Location, Location! It is a very quick walk to Victoria Station and any point in London we wanted to get to was an easy trip. The hotel is also very close to many major tourist attractions. Also on the Hotelink transfer we were the 2nd stop on arrival and 2nd last stop on the way back to the airport. Any type of store or service you might need is an easy few minutes walk and the area has a wide selection of restaurants and pubs to choose from.Our room was more than adequate and the beds were wonderfully comfortable! It was cleaned nicely and each day fresh towels came. The variety of elec. outlets was a great feature, as was the in room safe. During our visit the weather was very warm and the AC was a blessing.We ate breakfast (included) each day at the restaurant, though we did not have the &quot;hot&quot; food- the fresh fruit, juices, rolls, cereal, and the rest of the &quot;cold&quot; buffet was tasty and presented nicely. The coffee served with breakfast was horrible though, many days I could not even drink it, but would get a cup to go from someplace after we were out.Things that needed work: the front desk staff!!! Though many tried to get the customer service thing right, as a whole they are very young and not very experienced in how to deal with the traveling public. Rude behavior and/or flippant attitudes were a common theme. We encountered a few issues upon checkin and we had no recourse as each person helping become less competent and more rude! A real plus at the front desk however was Danny, the concierge. He was truly a gem -however off except for the for the last 2 days of our stay. Each and every suggestion he made was right on and in a very pleasant manner; the management needs to take notice and hire more the likes of him!I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel because overall the physical plant is what you are looking for, not the personality of those working the front desk!"
334,1040,"Jun 8 2005	Wonderful Break	we stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for a weekend in May. This is the 3rd time we have stayed at this hotel, and as usual, the standards were extremely high. The staff are always very friendly and helpful and the rooms are excellent. We have stayed now with two different sets of friends on our recommendation, and both have been very impressed with the hotel and the service and stated they would stay there again!Can't wait for another trip to London, we wouldn't stay anywhere else now!!!"
335,1040,Jun 3 2005	An enjoyable experience!	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for a week in May 2005. Everyone was very helpful. The breakfast was delicious. The rooms were a good size and clean. The location was excellent - very close to Victoria Station. It was a very enjoyable experience for us and we would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London UK.
336,1040,Jun 2 2005	Great stay at the Park Plaza	We chose the Victoria Park Plaza initially because of its location as we were attending our son's wedding at the nearby Guard's Chapel adjacent to Buckingham Palace. For those friends and family visiting us at the hotel it was just a short walk from Victoria rail &amp; coach stations.The hotel exceeded our expectations the facilities were excellent with the added benefit of a secure car park. Once inside the hotel and away from the foyer the peace and quiet made it easy to forget its central location. The staff were friendly and attentive and always smiled even if just passing in the corridors.We would not hesitate to recommend it and plan to use it for our future London visits
337,1040,"Jun 1 2005	Satisfactory Stay at Victoria Park Plaza	I was awarded a stay at this hotel through my bid on Priceline at a very reasonable rate. My husband and I stayed at the VPP for three nights. The modern decor did not particularly suit my tastes, but the room was spacious and included several amenities. I found the beds and pillows to be somewhat uncomfortable. The bathroom was quite nice with a large shower (hot water/good pressure). The room was clean but not impeccably so. We had an attractive view which included the tower of Westminster Cathedral which was lit up at night. Noise was not a problem at all. We did not have breakfast included in our rate, so we simply grabbed a croissant or pain au chocolat at one of the many grocery stores within the vicinity of the hotel. The location was excellent--only a 5 minute walk to Victoria Station. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again if the price was right, but I would not go out of my way to revisit the hotel."
338,1040,"Jun 1 2005	A lot of hotel for a little bit of money...	This was our first time in London, (May 21-28) so we chose this hotel for convenience. There is an express train from Gatwick to Victoria Station, and you can walk to the hotel. The hotel is new and the decor ultra modern, which I didn't like, but I realize this is a personal preference. I like English decor and charm. I've heard the older hotels tend to have smaller rooms and walls can be paper thin. My husband was quite content here, as he does not care if there is a picture of the Queen hanging over the bed. The Victoria PPH was very quiet. The rooms are spacious, the bed was big and very comfortable. The bathroom is gorgeous. There is an ice machine near the elevator. If you are a business traveler, it is perfect - high speed internet access, every plug possible, and a business center. It's like having access to your office. One of the best things about this hotel is the price for its location. We paid 115 pounds a night, which did not include breakfast and tax. Compared to other hotels in the middle of London, it's a very good price. Buckingham Palace is within walking distance (about 6 or 7 blocks). The staff was friendly and professional, but not as knowledgable about London as I would have expected, as English was a second language for most of them. The area around the hotel seemed a bit seedy, because it's so close to the station. But the hotel was an oasis, and after sightseeing all day we were mainly interested in a good nights sleep. All in all it is a nice place to stay. Two thumbs up for convenience, space, and price."
339,1040,"May 31 2005	One of the best !	I have stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza on numerous occasions and have found it to be one of the best hotels in central London. I have recommended this hotel to several business associates who, like myself, have been very impressed by both the location and general high standard of the hotel and it's facilities. All rooms are very well appointed and without exception staff are efficient, courteous and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure, it's one of the best and I'll certainly be back."
340,1040,"May 30 2005	Highly recommended!	My son and I just got back from our stay in London at the Victoria Park Plaza. We could not have ask for more in a reasonalby priced (by London standards) hotel. Our room was at the end of a hall around the corner from the lifts on the sixth floor and it could not have been quieter, in fact the whole floor was always quiet. The ice machine was just a few steps down the hall and the room itself was large (equal to US size rooms), with very comfy beds with cozy comforters and the bath was a good size with both function and decorative appeal. The room and hotel were both very clean and neat. All of the staff were very friendly, courteous and accomodating. We arrived on an early morning flight and could not check in when we first arrived at the hotel because a room was not ready. However, they were very kind and applogetic and ask us to ck back a bit later and they would try and have a room for us. they took care of our bags while we went out to explore and get a bite to eat. When we arrived back we were able to ck in about an hour early and this was much appreciated as we were exhausted from an eight hour flight and jet lag. The best thing was when they brought our bags up for us, as I didn't think I could lug them another step at that moment. When we arrived at our room and saw how appealing it was we were so relieved to be at a hotel we could relax in. I had anguished so much over choosing a hotel and I am so glad we did decide on Victoria Park Plaza. Also, if you are flying into Gatwick Airport it is very convenient to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Express train. We would certainly stay there again!"
341,1040,"May 28 2005	great location	We stayed here for a week and it was absolutely the perfect location. Everything was within walking distance. The tube is within a block. Our room was on the second floor, so the only view was of roof tops. It was roomy and the bathroom was very nice. The only thing the room lacked was comfortable chairs. There was only a desk chair and after a long day of walking it would have been nice to have had a place to sit. We opted for the package that included the &quot;club room&quot;. We had a hot breakfast each morning, nice fluffy robes and slippers, a paper at our door, minimal snacks(a few pretzels or olives) each evening and beer or wine. It was especially nice to have a comfortable place to sit and relax--since there were no comfortable chairs in our room.The room was very clean. The decor is modern with an Asian infuence. We did not find the desk staff very friendly, although we really did not need anything. I did ask the concierge for recommendations for dinner and he was not helpful at all. Although this is a Radisson/Carlson hotel they do not accept Gold cards.There were lots of nice pubs within walking distance--lots of options for pub food dinners. We especially enjoyed the Cardinal.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. In fact our children just went to London two weeks ago and stayed at this hotel and also had an excellent experience."
342,1040,"May 26 2005	Modern Comfy Convenient Affordable and Fabulous!	What a nice change this was from the standard small &amp; old hotels during a concurrent visit to Paris. For the price and location of this chic, ultra modern hotel, it's a bargain compared to other pricey London hotels. A train station is conveniently less than a block away and getting around the city is extremely easy from the hotel. This is a sweet deal!"
343,1040,May 19 2005	Great location	A great location!! Near Victoria train and tube station... Rooms are pretty good and if you search well you can get some good discounts online! Staff is friendly and helpful... We stayed here twice so far and will probably return in the future..
344,1040,"May 18 2005	Location Location Location	We just got back from a three week European vacation which started in London. This was our second time to stay at this hotel. The first time was right after it opened in 2002. It is a great location. It is just a few blocks from Victoria station. I would have given it five stars, but the staff is fairly young and can be downright rude, so only 4 stars. The rooms are nice and modern. Also this was one of the few hotels I've stayed at while in Europe that has an ice machine. That doesn't seem like a big deal until you go 3 weeks without ice for soft drinks. They also have a very nice gym."
345,1040,"May 17 2005	Convenient comfortable weekend stay	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza with a friend for a long weekend. Very comfortable beds and extremely quiet with the window closed and the a/c turned to low. There was an ice machine right next to the elevators (these were good sized and working.) The desk staff were efficient and helpful (use the pay phone one level down rather than the expensive room phones.) Clean roomy rooms and good bathrooms (hot water, not very good pressure.) Nice exercise center - 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, universal machines and free weights, also personal trainer and steam room. Full English breakfast available every morning buffet style (watch for improperly cleaned china and scummy cream pitchers.)Very convenient location about 2 minute walk to the Victoria tube/train station. One day pass for zones 1 and 2 was 4.70 pounds. Can get crowded on the more popular lines and be prepared for a lot of underground walking.All in all, a great getaway in a very good hotel."
346,1040,"May 2 2005	Great Hotel	My mother and I stayed at this hotel during the week of April 19. All of the reviews before were right on the money, very comfortable, clean hotel with a great staff. I highly recommend upgrading to the executive level (25 pounds extra per night). You get complimentary bathrobes, fruit basket in the room, and some extra goodies. The hot english breakfasts on the executive floor was very also nice. We were never available to go to the complimentry happy hour in the afternoon, but other guests said it was very enjoyable. As for traveling about, Victoria Station is less than three minutes away by foot, and most tourist sites are within walking distance. I must admit, it is not in the most beautiful area, but for the money you are saving...it is worth it.My only problem was the internet use, it was extremely expensive. But there are &quot;Easy Internet&quot; cafes all over the city for about two pounds an hour.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on a budget."
347,1040,"Apr 4 2005	Comfortable beds great breakfast	I stayed at the Park Plaza for a Stag weekend in April. The staff on the front desk were friendly, efficient and mainly from continental europe, but their English was very good. The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms clean and well appointed. The beds were very, very comfortable. There were some dried-up stains along the wall dividing the bedroom and bathroom, which looked like water damage. The breakfast was buffet style in a pleasantly open and airy resteraunt area just off the main lobby. There was an excellent choice of cereals, breads, toast, cold meats and of course, a full english breakfast."
348,1040,"Mar 31 2005 	I'm going back	I stayed at the VPP this past summer and will be going back this summer. I got a great rate before (about $150 in July) and will be paying about $200 this year. The best thing about the hotel is the location. Just a couple of minutes walk from Victoria Station. But the hotel is also clean and comfortable. I didn't use the bar or restaurant, so can't comment on those. The hotel does have a/c, which is important to me (despite what people might tell you, London gets HOT in the summer), and ice machines (a rarity in London). The bed was also one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on, and I travel a lot."
349,1040,"Mar 22 2005	Clean nice-smile-service good location.	We stayed at the VPP in March '05, between 11th and 14th. Compared to the avarage London's hotel prices the VPP is a good deal and perfectly located.We got a really good deal through the Volareweb web site. If you fly in to Gatwick airport, VPP is perfect as the Victoria Station is just 3 minutes walking from the hotel. By the way from Gatwick if you're not in hurry and can take 7 minutes more by train I won't suggest Gatwick Express but the normal train that is cheaper and end off at the Victoria Train station as well.The hotel is clean and well organized. Breakfast is good and included (in our case). The little fitness center &amp; spa is a good chance to rest after a day spent visiting the city. The staff is nice and friendly. My only warning would be to be carefull for who has breath problems as the climate of the rooms is really too dry. More than 2 nights can create problems, especially if your have to take a flight immediaty after. Defenitly better the high floors!"
350,1040,"Mar 21 2005	Location Style and Price	I'm a repeat visitor to the Vic Park Plaza, having visited twice in Nov, 2004, after my first stay in Nov, 2003.In 2004 I shared a Twin Room with a traveling companion. It was not as large as my prior King-bedded room, nor with as large a bathroom. In both rooms the HVAC seemed tempermental so I'd be careful of this property in the dead of summer.The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms clean, the decor modern; VERY convenient to Vic Station, Gatwick Express, and Tube. Buck Palace, Westminster and other tourist destinations are within walking distance. Keep checking the British Air site for pricing... they tend to be better than the more common web reservation engines.I'd probably like the pricier hotels in London also, but this is at the top of my budget!"
351,1040,"Mar 17 2005	Great Hotel...especially if you fly in to Gatwick!	We stayed at the VPP in March '05. We have stayed in several London hotels in the past, and for the money this is a great choice. We got a really good deal through Orbitz which made the US exchange rate not quite so painful. If you fly in to Gatwick airport, VPP is very convenient as the Gatwick Express train only stops at the Victoria Train station...a short walk from the hotel, even with luggage! My only warning would be to try to avoid the lower floors on the northwest side of the hotel as there is a loading dock (not part of VPP) that can be noisy at night. One night, the noise went on from midnight to 1am! Again, this is not the hotel's fault, but just be aware if you are placed in the lower floors (We were on floor 3).We really enjoyed this hotel and found it to be the perfect location for exploring London...the tube stop at Victoria station makes for a quick jaunt to all the major attractions in London."
352,1040,"Mar 6 2005	Fantastic stay	Friendly staff, very clean and extremely comfortable. The bed was HUGE! Stayed for one night only, would stay there again."
353,1040,"Mar 1 2005	Great place to stay!	I just got back from my trip to Paris and London and i have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. First off, the staff go out of their way to make sure you're pleased. What ever i ask for in the hotel was looked after right way and within 10 mins. And they were very helpfull in picking out places to eat and directions to attractions. The only small knock i have is that the card for the room didn't work on day and i had to wait in line to get it re-programed. But that's happend in other hotels to so i didn't really mind. Like another poster said, BAhoildays have the best prices for this hotel. And it includes breakfast too. You just have to pay a small 3.00GBP fee if you want it delivered to your room. I would for sure stay here again and the location, price and staff can't be beat."
354,1040,"Feb 25 2005	Quality Comfort Helpful .under one roof	I have had the pleasure to stay in some of the best hotels in the world, and some of the worst, I can assure you. The Victoria Park Plaza London was not about its design or its location although its compares with most.It was down to the high standard and service of the staff from the managers down to the porters nouthing was to much trouble for them, they just went out of their way to please you, recomending places of interest to visit and recomending local restaurants which did try to rip you off.Yes I certainly would give this hotel the top acolade for service keep it up."
355,1040,"Feb 21 2005	Good value for money!	The good news is that this hotel has a great value for your money. I had on BAholidays which had a much better rate than expedia and other sites. Its in a good location from what I read about other hotels I was extremely satisfied with paying $150/night. The continental breakfast that was included was also very sufficient and served its purpose. If I were to be a bit picky, the towels weren't the cleaniest. The wireless internet was overpriced and I had trouble using it. I got logged out and could not log back in since I was not provided a username and password after paying 15 pounds."
356,1040,"Feb 18 2005 	Good business traveller hotel - for now	Stayed here for one night. The rooms are nice, good size large bed, nice bathrooms. However this hotel is still quite new and it looks like the furnishings will get tired very quickly. Bathrooms are great and rooms contain all mod cons the business traveller needs. Hotel has average bar and breakfast for 4 star hotel.This hotel is a bed factory as demonstrated by the number of flight crews going in and out so don't expect anything other than the minimum level of service. During my one night experience, I did not get my wake up call or newspaper and my minibar bill was wrong!For anyone on holiday, be warned, there is very little in Victoria and as with everything else in London, taxis are extremely expensive!"
357,1040,"Feb 15 2005	prime locationgreat hotel	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in early feb.o5, I have been to london on two other occasions and stayed at other hotels . I wish I had found this hotel prior to those trips..what a great place to stay!!!!! room very comfortable,excellent staff ,prime location less that a five minute walk to victoria station. Anything you might need is very close by, currency exchange..places to dine or snack ,tourist info, there is a theater two minutes from the hotel. a great home base in which to enjoy you visit."
358,1040,Feb 4 2005	superb allround hotel experience	an outstanding place to stay with superb accommodation and excellent service. a fabulous hotel experience and highly recommended to anyone. wonderful food with plenty of it. excellent central london location close to all major attractions.
359,1040,"Feb 3 2005	Victoria Park Plaza	My husband and I and our two teenage boys stayed here January 14, 15 and 16th, 2005. The hotel is very clean and contemporary. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom great. The only problem we had at all was that housekeeping kept forgetting to give us towels, glasses were dirty and so was the electric kettle. This wouldn't stop me from staying there again though. One of the other reviewers mentioned booking through British Airways and theirs was the best rate I found with advance booking.My son was glad to have internet access for his laptop - for a fee. I was peasantly surprised to find a U.S. electrical socket in our room because the converter I took with me didn't want to work. Our rooms had an electric kettle and instant coffee.We didnt eat at the hotel but stopped in at Sainsbury's (large grocery store a half block to your left as you leave the hotel) several times to get deli style foods and breakfast items. We even picked up the Sainsbury's brand coffee in individual brew disposable cups which were handy.We also ate across the street from the hotel where we had some good Portuguese style grilled chicken. Very easy access to Victoria station - we flew into Gatwick and got the Gatwick Express (38 pounds first class for all four us on the special 4 for the price of 2 via the internet). (It's the only thing we've ever been able to afford first class!). To find hotel when you leave Victoria Station turn right and go down about 1 and a half blocks. We also took the Original Bus Tour double decker bus/boat tour which we thoroughly enjoyed even tho it was rather cold. We got tickets from the hotel concierge and got on the bus just around the corner to the left from Victoria Station. All in all it was a lovely stay and I won't even bother looking for another hotel for my next stay unless their prices go way up.One word of advice - if you want to use traveller's cheques call ahead. We had trouble using traveller's cheques in shops in England and went to four banks before we found one that would cash them for us. Having just arrived from Portugal we had Euros and some shops would'nt take those either. Had no problem with either currency at the airport ."
360,1040,"Feb 2 2005	Wonderful Hotel!	Wow! Large, modern, clean hotel with plenty of restaurants nearby. We stayed here in October of 2004. Our room was very large and clean with Euro, UK, and 110v outlets. The bathroom was very nice and had heated mirrors above the sink and tub!The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is a very short walk to Victoria Station and there is a very large Sainsbury Market nearby. Not more than a mile from Buckingham Palace. Be sure to ask for a room that faces Big Ben. If we are ever lucky enough to get to London again this is where we will be staying."
361,1040,"Jan 25 2005	Great location	Stayed here for two nights,ideal location for victoria station and the theatre, staff very helpful and willing, reccomend a stay.Dave Craddock, Southampton."
362,1040,"Jan 21 2005	Fabulous place	Lovely hotel, great concierge, very helpful. Short walk to Victoria Station , it was just lovely!"
363,1040,Jan 17 2005	Best 4 star hotel in London	I have used this hotel on several occasions now for both business and pleasure and have still found nothing bad to say about it!Its simply the best deal in London (if booked in advance). Great location beside victoria station and its on the doorstep of a range of great reataurants. If these dont suit then you are 5 mins by cab from the west end (or one tube stop from green park) and the delights of shepherds market in mayfair.The staff are very helpful and full of useful info on restaurants etc. I was recommended an Indian around the corner - told it looked awful but food was great - perfect description - I had to be carried home! Cant remember the name - just ask concierge.The decor is very modern which I love and the rooms are spacious and in immaculate condition. Book it and you wont be disappointed!
364,1040,"Jan 4 2005	very surprised	My husband and I stayed here on our first trip to Europe and were very surprised. From everything we had read we had very low expectations for European hotels. The Victoria Park Plaza was extremely clean, and spacious. The beds were wonderful!! They also had a continental breakfast that was more than ample and filling. The hotel was close to Victoria Station which you can access all buses and trains to just about anywhere. My husband and I don't like to walk to the mailbox and we considered it close. We also passed a Pizza Hut and Burger King on the way!! Across the street from the hotel was a small convience store which we were able to purchase important items like chips and coke. The only complaint we had was that our room faced an alley area for several buildings and the garbage truck was outside banging around for close to an hour one night. I think every dumpster in london was in that alley!!!! This was an excellent hotel and if ever in London again we won't hesitate to stay."
365,1040,"Jan 4 2005	Loved the Victoria Plaza Hotel!	After reading reviews on your website for many hotels in London, and researching deals, my husband and I chose to stay at the Victoria Plaza hotel in London. What a GREAT choice! It's a 4 star hotel--even by U.S. standards, it's 3 years old so everything is still nice and new, the service was outstanding, the continental breakfast was much more than we expected, and our room was perfect--queen size bed, nice bathroom. It's a very contemporary hotel (which is usually not my style), but it just added to the great London experience that we had. We got a great deal on the hotel (including breakfast) by going to British Airways website and booking through them (ba). The hotel is also across the street from Victoria Station, so if you fly into Gatwick you can take the Gatwick Express train directly from the airport to your hotel doorstep (costs about $40 each for round-trip). It's also within walking distance to the majority of London attractions--we recommend taking the Original Bus Tour, as well."
366,1040,"Dec 21 2004	Victoria Park Plaza London	I work in Victoria, London and have decided to treat my Girlfriend and get her to join me over Christmas 2004.I have just finished visiting all of the big hotels in the area and checked out the rooms and facilities in every one. I can guarantee you this is by far the best hotel. You will also not save much by using the internet bookers, the best price I found was 101pn for the standard (superior) room on the web, but the hotel secured me 150 for a suite with seperate living area, beroom and large bathroom with bath and seperate walk in shower, which I must say is gorgeous. Decor throughout in all rooms is good, so if you do book via a web site don't worry about receiving an inferior room as is often the case in London.The hotel is sitated within minutes walk of 2 theatres, Victoria Main line, Tube and Bus stations, 10minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, 5mins tube ride to Oxford St, Regent St, Bond St etc for shopping and ideally located for Parliment and the wheel.The only downside of this hotel is that is has no pool, the Hesperia Hotel just around the corner does, well it's about 10m long (no jokes!) but this hotel is in the middle of a refurb, some rooms are good some are VERY poor, plus it costs more. Take your chances. If your staying in Victoria, stay in the Plaza, even if your strctching yourself, at least you'll be safe in the knowledge that you've got a decent, clean hotel."
367,1040,"Dec 12 2004	Definitely a great place to stay	My son and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza from Dec. 4 through Dec. 10, 2004, and thoroughly enjoyed every part of our stay. The hotel is an excellent location, within walking distance of many of the primary London attractions, as well as being a very short walk to Victoria Station. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly--Dan the concierge is mentioned in another review, and we found him in particular to be extremely helpful and knowledgable. I did take advantage of the &quot;executive special&quot; for an additional 25 GBP per day and felt that it was a good deal--full breakfast, free wine and beer in the executive suite in the evening, plus (supposedly) a larger room--I would have to say I doubt that the latter was actually true, but we had an extremely nice room, so perhaps it was--small by U.S. standards, but typical for London. This is a very busy hotel that appears to have a sizable following among English and other European business clientele--my son and I especially enjoyed having a beer in the lobby bar in the evening and watching all the activity. It is a great place to stay at a very reasonable rate."
368,1040,"Dec 5 2004	Clean and Convenient but BYO Supplies!	The hotel was clean and in a very convenient central location (literally around the corner from Victoria Station). We did seem to have a problem with supplies though. Stayed in a double room (2 twin-sized beds) and were given no washcloths, about four towels daily - barely enough for 2 showers, a hand towel and bath mat and we had to ask for toilet paper and tissues even after Housekeeping had serviced our room. Once, the Housekeeping staff even refolded our dirty towels and left them behind rather than replace them with new ones! Also, had a problem with a/c. London was experiencing unusually warm weather during our stay and room was very warm. Couldn't seem to cool the room down. Wound up opening the window all night for cool air. Concierge service was excellent and very helpful. Room service prices were outrageous though(ie. 5.50BP for a bowl of ice cream?!) and desk staff tried to talk us into a &quot;special&quot; rate when we checked in whereby if we paid an extra 25BP/day (almost 50USD), we, both guests, would get breakfast included. This is a ridiculous amount to pay for 2 people for breakfast/day so we declined. Save your money: There are plenty of cheap places to eat at Victoria Station and a small market down the street if you want fresh muffins, etc. for breakfast."
369,1040,"Dec 5 2004	Perfect location and friendly staff	My friend and I just returned from a week at the Victoria Park Plaza and we had a wonderful time! The hotel was within walking distance to so many big attractions (London eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace) as well as the tube, grocery stores, restaurants and a cheap internet cafe. We felt the front desk staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Also the concierge Dan was wonderful in getting us theater tickets and reserving our afternoon tea. The room itself was clean and quiet. We felt we were very lucky to have booked this hotel and I would defintely stay here again."
370,1040,Nov 2 2004	Lovely London Experience!	We spent four nights at the Victoria Park Plaza hotel for our first trip to London and it was excellent. Not only was the quality of the hotel excellent but the location was just perfect! We left the hotel at 6 AM on the day that we were coming home and at 6:10 AM we were on the Gatwick Express train to go back to the airport. The close proximity to Victoria Station made it a snap to travel via train and the &quot;tube&quot;. We had the full breakfast buffet each morning and it was very well done. We will definitely return!
371,1040,"Nov 2 2004	Excellent choice!	My mom &amp; I stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions during our visit to London in October. I have lived in London so I am very aware of the different standards compared to North America. I have also stayed in a number of hotels in London so I know what is out there. More often than not the hotels are not as great as they claim, sometimes the tiny rooms are so small that there is no space to put your suitcase, sometimes the bathrooms are so cramped that you can barely shut the door, and usually the decor/walls/paint/beddding are falling apart. This is not the case for the Victoria Park Plaza. I read the reviews for many months before staying here and researched everywhere else &amp; I assure you that it would be a good choice considering it is London. It is the best hotel I have stayed at in London. London as a whole is overpriced and you cannot expect the same standards as North America. Keeping this in mind, this hotel is a great choice. The hotel is in a fantastic location, good breakfast, standard American size rooms, no problems checking in early, friendly staff (although none seemed to be British), and the bathroom is incredible with glass counters, huge bathtub &amp; neat shower. The towel supply is sufficient for 2 people contrary to what you may have read by other reviewers. I would love to stay here again but without a web deal it may be too pricy."
372,1040,"Oct 21 2004	Thank you Trip Advisor!	This was the best find! close to the Station..2 blk.walk. Tastefully appointed, good size rooms, above average bath and a real plus... closeline, iron and ironing board. My only wish is that they allow RESERVE for non-smokers! A class hotel and a great price."
373,1040,"Oct 20 2004	Location Location	We recently stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in Sept. of this year. We booked our hotel room through Trafalgar Tours. This hotel has it all. Very clean spacious rooms. All of the hotel staff were friendly and courteous. It was a very quiet hotel and we heard no outside street noise at all. Best of all was the location. We were very close to Victoria Station where we were able to take the tube or buses to anywhere in London. Maps of London were posted outside of Victoria Station which enabled us to find the right bus to where we wished to go. This hotel is also located very close to Victoria Coach Station if you wish to travel by coach to areas outside of London. Buchingham Palace is also in walking distance of the Victoria Park Plaza.Another plu s about staying at the Victoria Park Plaza is its close proximity to the Sainsbury Food Market. Before coming to London we had heard horror stories about how expensive it was to eat in London. We discovered Sainsburys was only about one block from the Vi ctoria Park Plaza. At Sainsburys we purchased our main evening meal at their deli style counter. Hot chicken, ribs or pizza were some of the items available plus a salad bar area where you could choose from a wide variety of items. The store also carrie d a good selection of wine and beer. We were able to eat very cheaply at this market.Through Trafalgar Tours the room rate for my husband and myself to stay in Victoria Park Plaza was $250.00 per night. This was a most reasonable rate for London. We ch ecked out other hotels in the area and they were more costly, older with narrow halls and some had no elevator just steep steps to another floor.We would definatly stay at the Victoria Park Plaza next time we are in London. We had a very enjoyable experience in London and a lot of it was due to the fact we stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza."
374,1040,"Oct 18 2004	Love it and high recommend it!!!	What a different feeling after 4 nights of smelly hotel in Paris. This one delivers exactly what it promised. Rather new and high-tech look hotel. Big room, big bed and the room have virtually all you need. After the bad taste in Paris, this one got my approval. I fully am recommending this hotel. It located near Victoria Station. Very convenient but their staff are rather inexperience. So be mindful on that. One incident, they sent away my airport bus shuttle without me because they thought the driver came to pick up someone who is not their guest. But they remedy quickily by complimented a cab for me to airport. Very very professional. So go for it and hopefully their management style remain no change or better."
375,1040,"Oct 10 2004	Great Find!	We just returned from London and stayed at two different hotels. The first was twice the price of the Park Plaza and not nearly as nice. We arrived around 9am and our room was available. And it had a king sized bed! Room size was like your typical US major chain. Location was great. Close to the tube. Great Italian restaurant up the road across from the Apollo theatre. Breakfast was just ok and overpriced, but no more so than other hotels. With the web deals available, this is someplace we would definately stay again and tell our friends about."
376,1040,"Oct 10 2004	Enjoyed Our Stay	Stayed at Victoria Park Plaza for eight nights in September/October 2004. Modern chrome and glass business hotel. Little atmosphere, but clean and efficient. Room was like mid price American motel.Pluses: Location. 1 block to Victoria Railway Station (underground) 2 blocks to Victoria Coach Station (tour busses). Concierge very helpful and didn't have his hand out for every little piece of advice. Found three good restaurants within two blocks-seafood, grilled chicken, Chinese. And there are other choices. Also Sainsbury's supermarket one block away.Minuses: (not very serious) Continental breakfast in lobby restaurant was adequate-no more. They offer a 4 pound upgrade to full English breakfast. Pass on the upgrade unless you like that stuff--most Americans would not. On site restaurant expensive and, well, they prepared the breakfast. Internet cafe one block--but it was dirty, scary and the equipment didn't work. Never did get my daily in room newspaper, though I asked twice. Note: Although the address is in Vauxhall Bridge Road, the entrance is on the other side of the building on Wilton Road--one block west."
377,1040,"Oct 2 2004	Try the apartments	My wife, my baby son and I stayed here in a 1BR apt for 9 days. This hotel has 2 floors of apts on the top. Given that most London hotels offer small rooms and any room with 2 beds is typically stocked with twin beds, this was a much better set up. We had a full kitchen w/ fridge, microwave, dishwasher, and stove. We had 1.5 baths, 2 TVs and over 600 sq ft. They were also kind enough to bring up a pack and play crib. This price is what was comparable to many other 2 bed rooms in business hotels - so we felt it was a much better deal. Many others have already commented how convenient the location is. You can access trains, buses and the Tube at Victoria Station. The only thing that wasn't good was that the hotel only has 2 settings for climate control - AC or heat and until they've made a complete changeover (ie, every room changes from AC to heat in the late fall), you're stuck. It was cold in London in late Sept but only cool air came out. The hotel offered us space heaters instead. Anyone w/ small kids should consider the apt route and this place was just fine for that."
378,1040,"Oct 2 2004	Ask for a key to the Executive Suite	Checked in at 7:30 a.m. Rooms ready!Great location near Victoria Station for tubes and trains. The Gatwick Express pulls in within walking distance to the hotel with your luggage (no cabs needed). This is a very good location for London sightseeing trips because of easy access to the Tube. I have been to London three times, and I highly recommend this hotel for location as well as other amenities.For Europe, a very nice sized room. American style. Excellent value; booked on Expedia.They upgraded us and our friends to &quot;executive&quot; rooms, which were very nice. We had a Queen size (not just full) bed, small couch, electric kettle for instant coffee and tea, plenty of closet space, drawers, hair dryer, iron, nice TV, big shower, etc. We were on Floor 2. Though facing a busy street, the window was very thick and noise proof. If you have stayed in a London or other Euro hotel, you know that this is impressive, though about standard for a decent U.S. hotel.Our friends got a room on Floor 1 with a key to the Executive Room that is on that floor. This was a BIG COUP! FREE hot breakfast (eggs, sausages, cereal, juice, toast, etc.) with waitress, pot of coffee or tea, some free beer in the evening, free internet and free papers. We all enjoyed it a great deal. (They let us in on their pass key.) Beg or bribe your way into a Executive Room pass key!I would definitely stay there again, especially if I could finagle that Executive Room key."
379,1040,"Sep 29 2004	Victoria Park Plaza an exceptional hotel	My wife and I just returned from a 7 night stay at the Victoria Park Plaza. Our experiance could not have been better. The location of this hotel is ideal in Westminster, 5 minutes walk from the Victoria underground station. In Victoria station there is a large mall with a floor of restarunts all reasonably priced. A pub 1/2 block from the hotel between Victoria station and the hotel offers lively atmosphere ang good prices.Sainsburry supermarket is 2 minutes walk. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. The room we enjoyed for 7 nights was an executive level room on floor two. It featured an honest king sized bed plenty of storage, nice sitting area and large bathroom with both a separate tub and walk in shower. The decor is brittish modern with lots of glass and stainless accents. The room was very clean and well appointed with free safe, iron, complimentary coffee and tea, and of course a very overpriced mini bar. With our room we had full use of the executive lounge which included a FULL breakfast buffet although the selection was the same everyday. At night the lounge offered free beer and wine as well as soft drinks and snacks. We recieved the executive room upgrade for $30 american per day, in our minds this was worth it to get a hot breakfast drinks, and a king sized bed. We paid with tax $1525 for 7 nights september 17-23. When we visit London again we will make every effort to book this property again."
380,1040,"Sep 28 2004	Classy Hotel with Style	We stayed at this excellent hotel because we were able to negotiate a great rate on the internet. The room contained a king size bed and all the amenities required. The included breakfast needs work though - the buffet choices never varied from day-to-day, and the quality of the hot food was disappointing. Desk staff were wonderful, as were most of the restaurant staff with the exception of one or two young women with disdainful attitudes to all customers. Victoria Station is close by, and it is easy walking from this hotel to many of London's attractions. We would definitely stay at this stylish hotel again providing we were able to obtain similar rates - and would happily recommend the hotel to anyone. Impressive!"
381,1040,"Sep 27 2004	Victory at Victoria	We just came back after staying at the Victoria Park Plaza for 4 nights. I thought the rooms were excellent, very modern and extremely tasteful. The bathroom was great, since it included both a tub and separate shower. The design of the shower, although very modern, allowed some leakage under the shower door which was a little problem, but not a major one. Location is excellent, a short walk to Victoria Station and the tube.Staff was extremely courteous and even got us a room early when we arrived. Very nice bar in lobby with interesting artwork everywhere. I would definitely stay here again....and the price was extremely reasonable for London. Too bad the rest of London wasn't so reasonable!"
382,1040,Sep 17 2004	September 2004 stay	We stayed here for 4 nights the middle of Sept. Our first trip to London. Room was fine but we had to ask for extra towels. For a 4 star hotel towels were small and of poor quality. Staff was helpful and friendly. Location central to most tourist spots and tube a short walk away. Drinks and breakfast were overpriced. We would stay there again.
383,1040,"Sep 17 2004	Good for the price I guess	Stayed here on my honeymoon at the end of March/beginning of April. Booked through an online travel sight as part of an air and hotel package. The price was right, paid about $100US for the room. They had no problems with an early check in of about 9am. I had requested a King bed room. I was given a upgrade to an &quot;executive room&quot;, but it had two single/twin beds. After being given two other rooms without King beds the two single beds were pushed together to make a King. The breakfast in the executive lounge was good, along with the free drinks in the afternoon. Great location! About like the average Hampton Inn in America as far as room size goes."
384,1040,"Sep 16 2004	we stayed for 7 nights great hotel in a great location would reccomend to anyone	we stayed for 7 nights, it was realy great, ina terrific location 3 minutes from metro and trains, 10minutes from the palace, and 3 minutes from two live shows and restrauants"
385,1040,"Sep 6 2004	Awesome Stay - Very convenient	We stayed at this hotel in late July for 4 nights and we just loved it. We were in London after 2 weeks touring Southern England. This has to be one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. Very clean, staff were friendly but not pushy or overbearing. The room is very nice...bed extremely comfortable, clean, modern bathroom. Great location (especially if you are coming in from Gatwick as the Express comes into Victoria Station a mere 3 minutes walk). You can also pick up taxis from the stand at Victoria Stn. although this is extremely busy at rush hour. While staying here we were able to walk to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, London Eye, Buckingham Palace etc. There are also quite a few theatres around this area. Food places in the area tend to be a bit boring and are mostly chains but hop the tube and within minutes you are in more interesting areas like Covent Garden or Leicester Square. Stay here if you have the chance for sure!"
386,1040,"Sep 4 2004	Perfect in more ways than one	A friend and I traveled to London in March, 2004. After staying in overpriced, cramped hotel rooms in Paris and other parts of London , I was so relieved and happy to be at a hotel that was clean, comfortable, roomy, trendy, and well-located. The service from the staff was above average, and I have recommended this hotel to a few friends. It is by no means the Ritz, however, it is moderately priced and offers more than you pay for compared to other hotels in London."
387,1040,"Aug 30 2004	Towels are like golddust	The rooms in the Victoria Park Plaza are spacious by London standards. The staff are pleasant, but certainly did not display the exceptional qualities highlighted by some of your reviewers. In the final analysis, however, I accept that such evaluations of consumer service are essentially subjective.I paid 145 sterling (inclusive of taxes but exclusive of breakfast) a night for my room in the Victoria Park Plaza. Given the room rate, I found it surprising to discover that the towels for the bathrooms are like golddust and that - instead of supplying me with fresh towels on the second day of my stay (the 25th of August) - the staff simply folded the old, slightly damp towels and replaced them on the towel rack. I know of many more reasonably priced hotels in which consumers are at least given the option of requesting clean towels every day. The billing policy operated by the Victoria Park Plaza is out of kilter with that employed by several hotels. Usually, when I buy goods and services in London, I am billed in Sterling and my bank or credit card company converts the Sterling bill into Euro and this is reflected on my credit card invoice. The Victoria Park Plaza took it upon themselves to convert my Sterling bill into Euro and to bill my credit card company in Euro. This would have been fine if they had given me a favourable rate of exchange. But the rate of exchange used by the Victoria Park Plaza was less than competitive in the light of prevailing exchange rates. My warning to consumers from Euroland and the U.S.A. is that they should not be prepared to allow the hotel to convert Sterling bills into their local currencies unless they are satisfied that they are receiving a competitive exchange rate deal from the Victoria Park Plaza. In conclusion, the hotel is conveniently located, five minutes walk away from the Victoria underground and railway station. All in all, 'average' would be the fairest description I could attach to this hotel."
388,1040,Aug 22 2004	Value Location	Two rooms for a recent four night family visit. Both were clean and everything functioned properly. The location is excellent of course and the staff were friendly and helpful. Several nearby pubs (try The Elusive Camel) make the location even more desirable. Good value.
389,1040,"Aug 20 2004	fab a dab a doos	excellent value,friendly and very helpful staff, beautiful rooms, with airconditioning. restaurant excellent, no complaints from any of our party of five. Will be returning at a later date thats for sure. thank you all for a very enjoyable stay at your hotel. yours sincerely mr K G O'Neill"
390,1040,"Aug 17 2004	Good Location - Helpful Staff	We flew into Gatwick and took the train directly to Victoria Station. It was wonderful that the hotel was only a 5 minute walk since we had flown overnight. They were kind enough to give us a room at 8 in the morning. We changed and headed out for the day, trying to avoid jet lag. Came back to the hotel at 8 in the evening and the room was like a sauna - After a half an hour of trying to get someone to come and look at the air conditioning they upgraded us to a mini-suite. New room was wonderful.Next morning left to catch a cruise ship in Southampton and again within 5 minutes we were at the Coach station with buses directly to the pier- Extremely convenient.Hotel is relatively new and very clean"
391,1040,"Aug 15 2004	Friendly	Stayed here for two nights in September, 2003, which is, granted, far from high season. The location, two or three blocks from Victoria Station (and within walking distance of many of your standard London must-sees), is excellent particularly if you are planning to make heavy use of the tube; Victoria is on three very key lines (hotels near South Kensington/Earl's Court are also good this way). The rooms are nothing special, about the standard of a four star American hotel. The staff was very friendly. Worth it, particularly at the USD 125 we paid through hotels."
392,1040,Aug 10 2004	Great staff Great location Great hotel	We just returned from a wonderful week in London for our 25th Anniversary. (July 31-Aug. 7). WE enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the staff was very helpful helping us to get around and excellent restaurants. We were locat by either easy to walk to or easy access by the subway. If we ever get a chanceto return we will definately be staying here again.
393,1040,Aug 10 2004	Simply Grand!	We had the pleasure of staying at the hotel over Christmas and New Years and had excellent service. We arrived very late on Christmas Eve and the kitchen stayed open and made a special meal for us. Unheard of in London! The rooms were grand in comparison to most and the staff very helpful. We will be staying again
394,1040,Aug 10 2004	Love the Hotel Excellent value for money	The hotel was great. Excellent location just 2 mins from Victoria underground station. The restaurant serves great food and the coffee shop in the hotel serves great coffee and sandwiches.Pricewise i got a great deal for what i wanted. The room was big and was cleaned daily. The TV has plenty of channels to watch and the staff were really nice. I will definetely go back and strongly recommend it to business travellers.
395,1040,"Aug 10 2004	the victoria park plaza is the best location in london	We chose the Victoria park plaza in london because of its location, and we chose the right one. you can actucally walk to Buckingham palace, and the magnificent Westminster abbey, and many other attractions also. It is also just a two block walk from the victoria tube station, and the golden tour bus line which we booked 4 tours from.the people at the front desk were very helpful, at any hour of the night, and they even let us check in at 800 am. the rooms were nice, and comfortable, and the lifts worked fine. The only part I did not like was the restaurant, but there are many restaurants within a couple of blocks , so thats ok , on a scale of 1=10 this gets a solid 8. we will stay here if we go back to London, a Great city."
396,1040,"Aug 9 2004	Not worth it	Stayed July 2004. This hotel is very over rated. It is at best a 2 star hotel. The rooms are very small, there is constant porno on the tv and when asked the staff to block the porno, was given another porno channel instead. There is no coffee in the room and in fact u have to cross the street to find any. The rooms are not cleaned properly unless u complain and towels are guarded like gold, beds are changed only when asked. I would not stay here again, for the price, not worth it."
397,1040,"Aug 1 2004	Excellent for London	Stayed 29-31 July 2004 due to a fabulous deal via lastminute.co.uk. The hotel was spacious and modern, much better than any other London hotel i have experienced. Handy for the tube and a five minute stroll down to the Tate gallery on the banks of the Thames. We got the continental breakfast included which was priced at 13 pppn full english was an extra 4... a bit steep.. but hey it's London!! Most of the staff seem to be foreigners working overseas.. i read some reviews of guests having problems with staff but not in my case, everyone i spoke to was friendly and polite I would definately stay here again next time i am London"
398,1040,"Jul 26 2004	really nice	We got a reservation through Travelocity, which was a lot less expensive than through Expedia--we don't know why because usually it is the opposite. The hotel is very well located (near Victoria Station). In addition, the staff was nice and attentive.The breakfast prices (full or continental) were quite a bit expensive. But the room was nice and comfortable, large for European standards, and clean. We would go back to and recommend this hotel."
399,1040,"Jul 22 2004	Fantastic Hotel...Can't wait to go back!!!	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza from July 11-16, 2004. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is amazingly helpful. The room is surprisingly large and the bathroom is great. The continental breakfast consisted of breads, cereals, fruits, and cheeses. It was more than enough so we didn't feel the need to upgrade to the full breakfast. We had dinner one night in the hotel restaurant. The food was fantastic, but a bit pricey. (isn't everything in London pricey?) The location near Victoria station is perfect. The tube makes it so easy to get around. I can't say enough positive things about this hotel. I will definitely stay in this hotel on my next trip to London."
400,1040,"Jul 22 2004	Wonderful Hotel	My family of 5 spent four nights at the Victoria Park Plaza in June. The location was ideal for tourists - an easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Parliament. It is also literally around the corner from Victoria Station...so all of London is easily accessible from either the train or the tube. The hotel itself is attractive, clean and extremely comfortable. My family does quite a bit of travelling and we rank the Victoria Park Plaza beds at the very top of our favorite list! Rooms are well-equipped and modern. The staff was very helpful and accomodating. Our request for a cot (our 3 children shared a room) was met instantly. Staffers also directed us to various restaurants and tourist sites and were extremely helpful and courteous. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel and plan to stay there again the next time we're in London."
401,1040,"Jul 21 2004	Victoria Park Plaza	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza from June 30-July 3/04. It was a perfect location for us as we wanted to be near the Victoria Coach Station to board the bus to Harwich. The tube and bus station is about a three minute walk. Our room was very clean, a nice size with a king bed, and modern by North American standards. They had newspapers available to read, very helpful concierge. There is also an internet cafe just down the street across from Victoria Station. If you turn left outside the hotel there are a few great reasonable restaurants and a fabulous grocery store."
402,1040,"Jul 15 2004	We loved the Victoria Park Plaza	My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 8 nights in June and July before and after a cruise. It was all that we had hoped for from all the positive reviews we read on tripadvisor. The room was excellent and quiet on both stays. The bathroom was spotlessly clean with a wonderful tub and shower. If you want washcloths, just leave a note for housekeeping because they are not automatically supplied with the towels. The higher the floor the less chance of hearing any outside traffic. We were on the 7th floor before the cruise and on the 4th floor after the cruise and both rooms were equally wonderful. There is a safe in the closet which is large enough to hold a laptop. The location was also the best we could have hoped for. It was a five minute walk to the tube at Victoria Station and convenient to a supermarket, just down the street from the main entrance. An internet cafe that only charged one pound for 35 minutes is across from Victoria Station and a great inexpensive pub which is also called a freehouse is just up the street from the hotel. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful with any questions that we had. We never ate in the restaurant which seemed to be very overpriced. but a small coffee shop just off the lobby was very good for early morning coffee. We would definitely stay here again on any trip to London."
403,1040,"Jul 14 2004	Great great great hotel	just got back from this fantastic hotel &amp; have already told 5 friends they must stay here.anything negative you've read on this website about this place is total trash. anything positive you've read is the absolute truth. the location,staff,amenities,bed,bathroom,surroundings everything is top shelf. i can't say enough good things about this place. we were thrilled. there is no other hotel i'd stay at when in london. it was GREAT!! DO IT!!"
404,1040,"Jul 12 2004	Great location good for the money	Loved Victoria Park Plaza - very modern, clean, friendly staff, except for the bartender. Very close to Buckingham palace - on a quiet street, yet near all the major attractions. Highly recommend when they are running specials and have rates below $150/night."
405,1040,"Jul 11 2004	best deal in London great new addition to a great city	Great new hotel. A true find in London. we got the internet special rate, and were so pleasantly surprized to check in to this modern and wonderfully located hotel. The bathroom and shower is an experience, and the nice little touches like the coffee service, the mirrors with steam proof areas, the huge king size bed, and the comforter coverlet were all appreciated. Also appreciated was the friendly and informative staff. LOVED the little coffee barista on the lobby level, and the seats outside...not usual for hotels in big cities. Try the new super, super market that opened a hop and a skip away from the hotel. Also a hop and a skip is some of the major sights in London (Westchester Cathedral and Abbey, Parliment, Big Ben, The London EYE, the Tate, ect)..We are looking forward to our next stay in London, and our next stay at this fine hotel"
406,1040,"Jul 8 2004	Will Go Back!!	My husband and I stayed here in late June, 2004 and were thrilled. To begin, the location was amazing. We flew into Heathrow Airport and took the Heathrow Express to Victoria Station. It was about a 2 minute walk to the hotel which was great! On the first day we were there we were jet-lagged and wanted to take a small walk. On this small walk we were able to get to Big Ben, Parliament, the Millenium Eye, and Buckingham Palace. Not bad for a leisurely stroll! On our second day I took another stroll while my husband was still sleeping and walked to beautiful Hyde Park (to see the new memorial to Princess Diana) and Harrods. Next, the room was of decent size and very clean, with a safe and iron. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was very quiet and air-conditioned which was nice because it was quite warm while we were there. The bathroom was clean and modern. The only thing that through me for a loop was that there was only a partial shower door so I did get some water on the floor during my first shower! An elderly person would probably have had trouble entering the tub as the walls were high. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. I had read some reviews on this site saying that the staff was cold or rude and I found that to be far from true. There was certainly no one who came running over to offer up information but everyone was very animated when we approached them and asked a question. We asked several times for directions and they were always very clear and detailed. We asked twice for recommendations on restaurants. Both times they took the time to question us back about our specific likes/dislikes/etc. and provided great recommendations. One staffer stopped short of asking us how much we were looking to spend and phrased the question what were you hoping to wear to the restaurant tonight which I got a kick out of! We ate one quick meal at the hotel bar which was adequate food but over-priced. The breakfast menu was over-priced as well, and we didnt even attempt to eat it. The little caf attached to the hotel was quite good though for a quick sandwich, fruit smoothie, or gourmet coffee. I highly recommend it. The hotel fitness room was also adequate. It had several machines and free weights and was clean and spread out. Every time I used it, I was alone so that was nice!I would certainly stay here again!"
407,1040,"Jul 6 2004	Great value	My husband and I booked 4 nights at the Victoria Park Plaza over the Internet. We were a little suspicious of the very low rate but were thrilled to discover a very comfortable, clean and quiet hotel room in a terrific location. The room was large; the king-sized bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and modern. Staff was helpful and friendly. We'll definitely go back!"
408,1040,"Jul 5 2004	Not so good after all	Good location, but a few faults...As expected, the rooms were modern and stylish, especially the bathroom which was clean and spacious. I expected a few quirks though. The minibar was locked as expected and I did not bother to ask the front desk at all after reading about the attempts by other travellers. I tried to boil water using the in-room kettle but found it very dirty. Housekeeping wasn't very helpful in helping to change for a new one. The housekeeping service wasn't thorough enough. I had to leave notes for the housekeeping to look at certain areas. The worst was the last day when the concierge informed me of the wrong airport terminal from where I was supposed to depart from. Front-dest staff weren't very friendly to Asians and rather laid-back."
409,1040,"Jul 2 2004	I will certainly stay here again!!	My husband and I stayed here in late May-early June, 2004 and were very pleased. Choosing my headline to say that I will certainly stay here again is (in my opinion) the most accurate way to describe how much I enjoyed my stay because he thinks I am too picky! He had booked a hotel in London that TripAdvisor users were not kind to and I promptly cancelled that reservation and booked at the VPP. I am so glad that I did!First of all, we flew in to Gatwick Airport and took the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station. We were happy to see just how close the hotel was to the station...not just because we were carrying luggage, but every time we went out for the day, we took the tube. Victoria Station has 2 tube lines, the District and the Circle to get you around the city, or to another tube line. On a slow day, it took us about 5 minutes to walk there. The location could not have been better! (note there are a lot of good restaurants in Victoria Station, too!)Next, the hotel itself. The concierge guys were so helpful and friendly. They knew the area and even were concerned about helping us save $$$--we wanted to use the internet service in the hotel's business center...they sent us down about a block by Victoria Station to a little internet cafe that was so much more economical. Great way to keep in touch with home at about 2 pounds for about an hour of internet time. They could have kept their mouth shut to pay them 8 pounds for 15 minutes. When employees help me out that way, I give my thumbs up to them. And finally, the room. I was concerned...after reading other hotel reviews about how small London hotel rooms are, the bathrooms...but not a problem here! Plenty of room for us and a nice sized bathroom. Always kept very clean. The room has a safe and iron, as well as a US (and other countries') outlets. The bed was extremely comfortable. We would even rank it up there with the &quot;Heavenly&quot; bed at the Westin or Sheraton. The rooms were also very quiet and we faced the main street. Could not hear the other guests in the hall way, either.I cannot speak for the food at the hotel...we went to the small store across the street from the main entrance for snacks/drinks and ate at restaurants around and in Victoria Station. If you are in London for a week, make sure you buy a weekly tube pass for the best deal. The hotel is in walking distance to Buckingham, Parliament, etc....though bring good walking shoes, the best way to get around is to walk!As I started off, I would certainly stay here again and I have told many of my friends and collegues that are planning London trips to stay here."
410,1040,"Jul 1 2004	Above average	Our 3-night stay at the Victoria Park Plaza was good, but short of great. The room was a perfect size, despite our expectations for a typically small &quot;European&quot; room. The bathroom was outstanding, so no complaints there. The location, as previously mentioned, couldn't get any better. Just a few annoyances made the stay less than spectacular -- a noisy pub across the street (not the fault of the hotel mgmt, of course) and a rather &quot;stiff&quot; staff, personality-wise. I suppose it could be chalked up to an American expecting a British person to be chatty... but it would have been nice to see a smile once in awhile. Anyway, overall, a very good experience, and definitely worth the money (found a great rate on the Park Plaza website)."
411,1040,"Jul 1 2004 	Excellent hotel!	I stayed for 6 nights recently and found it to be one of the best hotels I've stayed at in the UK. The front staff was very nice and helpful. The room was clean and modern (something very hard to find in Europe) with frosted glass bathroom doors, new furniture and a room safe which is so handy with passports, cash, airline tickets and all.I had read some complaints from previous reviews about the staff, pillows, towels, etc., but found no problems with any of these. My room was on the 6th floor with views of the London Eye and Big Ben.Being a short distance to Victoria Station was perfect for touring and it was an easy walk to beautiful Hyde Park.This hotel is great!"
412,1040,"Jul 1 2004	Great Location	Stayed at this hotel for four nights and found it to be in the best location. We walked everywhere. The rooms were clean, comfortable and nicely decorated, and the reception and concierge very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. It was great."
413,1040,"Jun 28 2004	Great Hotel!!	This is a great hotel. We stayed here twice during our visit to Europe, once for a week at the beginning of our trip and then an additional 2 days at the end. It is a new hotel and very modern. We chose a standard room and it was great. The rooms are large, clean and have all modern facilities. The bathrooms have glass countertops and a speaker so you can hear the TV while taking a shower. The shower door was a little odd as it was just covered a small portion of the shower, but it worked fine. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the Victoria Tube/Bus/Train Station that will get you anywhere you want to go. There are many restaurants, pubs and shops right in the area. It is also in walking distance to Buckingham Palace and many other attractions, if you dont like to walk you can take the bus/tube anywhere you need. We found a little store across the street that we went to almost every day to get water and snacks. We had a nice view of the London Eye and rest of the city from our hotel room. We had no problems the whole time we were there and would definitely stay here again!"
414,1040,"Jun 28 2004	Mixed Reviews	Spent 5 nights at this hotel in late May/early June of 2004. The first room was lovely -- very sleek, clean with large comfortable bed. Upon returning after a few nights away, we were given a room that left much to be desired! The carpet had greasy looking stains, something we would never put up with at home! Left us a bit depressed. The staff was very cooperative, and we were allowed to check in very early on the day of our return. They gave us keys to the executive room to make up for our complaints regarding our earlier stay. As for meals, their room service delivered one of the best salads I've ever eaten. The full breakfast in the restaurant, however, was extremely overpriced.I would return, but would be very specific about my needs and desires when booking -- and ask to see the room before accepting it."
415,1040,"Jun 27 2004	Great Hotel for our vacation!	My wife and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for a week! Everything was perfect! Close to the tube, big rooms, clean good service! Let us check in early! (10 AM) It was our first time to London so we were so happy to get US sized rooms and no problems! Many business people stay there but it is still great for a vacation! Would stay again!"
416,1040,"Jun 24 2004 	Worked Well	My business partner and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in May and found it worked well for the reasons we chose it: 1. location 2. business services 3. new &amp; clean.1. We used the Underground from Heathrow to the Victoria Station, with just a short walk to the hotel. The station was handy for our daily route to Olympia, plus got us easily to other areas of the cityAccess to the Gatwick Express is also good.2. U.S. plus outlets let us recharge our cell phones; having a safe, hairdryer and iron helped too3. Avoiding mystery smells and grime is a good thing.Other comments: Front desk staff was too busy to be friendly but helped when asked; rooms are small, but good size for the city and rate. Lounge is comfortable. There are decent food outlets nearby."
417,1040,"Jun 23 2004	Cant fault the place	Having just returned from a four night stay felt compelled to write and express our view on the VPP, excellent....everything we needed was there, flowers and champagne which I'd organised in advance for my wife's birthday, comfortable room on first floor looing into the courtyard area, pleasant staff and prompt room service etc, the gym with the sauna and steam room was good as well. The wife loved the triple sized bed....we are going to buy one of these for when the kids keeping jumping in the bed. Location good for getting about."
418,1040,"Jun 23 2004 	Compared with other London hotels this is very good..	Have stayed in numerous hotels in London and this hotel is a league above the vast majority. Rooms are clean, modern and spacious, with air-conditioning.Bathroom was cool, glass sink unit and good showers, one over the bath and a separate unit.Tea/coffee facilities in room.Breakfast not impressive, but have had far worse! Very convenient for Victoria bus/rail/tube. Marks and Spencer Food outlet at station open until 11 most nights selling beer, wine etc at far better prices than mini-bar.Would definitely recommend and will be using the hotel again. Got excellent rate via laterooms."
419,1040,"Jun 23 2004	Very nice hotel	This hotel is in a great location for all modes of transportation. If you like walking, you will be within walking distance of several of the popular sites. The rooms are nice and comfortable, the restaurant is not so great. If I ever get back to London I'd stay at this hotel again."
420,1040,"Jun 20 2004	Watch Out for the Victoria Park Plaza	My first stay at this 4 star hotel was very bad. I asked for a quiet room and was given a room across the street from a noisy Pub. Loud Music and Euro 2004 football patrons made for a bad night. The room smelled of rotton eggs or worse. Trying to change the room led to nothing but an exasperated look from the staff. The location was very good. Just a few minutes from Victoria Station, which kept it from being a total loser.The Full English Breakfast at $17.50GBH was a disastor. Loud rock and roll music played and when I asked if it could be turned down, it was, then turned up again. The frieds eggs were not done and the scrambled so watered down, I was amazed. Very little other food was on the buffet. The coffee was excellent. When I told the Manager of my unhappiness he wanted to argue that I should have mentioned this to him earlier so he could have had a custom breakfast made for me. I spent the next 3 days in Shropshire in a delightful B&amp;B and when I returned for one more night at the Victoria Park Plaza (prepaid), I was given a beautiful upgraded room in a quiet courtyard, that did not smell. The breakfast, though not worth the price was at least edible."
421,1040,"Jun 14 2004	Great stay in London!!	Our stay in London the last week of May was wonderful, due in part to our hotel. The location was great; within walking distance of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, and other popular attractions. This hotel is also close to Victoria station, which made it extremely convenient to catch trains, buses and metros. The hotel is contemporary, and the rooms are sizeable. There are American electrical outlets in the rooms, which came in handy for us. The service at the bar left much to be desired, and the breakfast was really expensive for what was offered, but I would still highly recommend this hotel. (One note; there really are no wash rags left in the rooms, and thanks to this website, we packed our own. I would suggest this idea to others as well.)"
422,1040,"Jun 10 2004	Location great hotel average	I booked this hotel through British Airways based on the rave reviews here. I was rather disappointed as my room wasn't huge, though I did get a room facing the street as I asked. It was a smoking room but fortunately I couldn't smell the smoke and left the window open at all times.There was quite a lot of dirty marks on the hallway carpet and in my room, along with other signs of neglected wear and tear. The sink was slow to drain until I took out the stopper. The clothesline link was put in backwards so you need to step into the bathtub to pull it out and latch it (or maybe I'm just too short).The breakfast was a standard London continental service but some of the fruit was left out too long.I did appreciate the proximity to Victoria station, eating places all over, a Sainsbury grocery store and an internet cafe all within five minutes walking distance."
423,1040,"Jun 9 2004	Great Hotel!	Great Hotel, Perfect Location, Spotless. Had a wonderful time"
424,1040,"Jun 5 2004	Perfectly modern	The Victoria Park Plaza Hotel is pefect: -perfectly located (near the Victoria train station  and tube) -perfectly modern, and beautiful in every way, especially the bathroom and glass accents -perfectly helpful staff (they allowed me to check in at 10:00 AM!) -perfectly quiet and comfortable -perfectly priced, considering how much hotels are in London."
425,1040,"Jun 4 2004	An unbeatable value in the heart of London!	Booked via their website at 79 pounds a night and was blown away. The hotel reminds me of time spent in Tokyo as everything is modern and sleek (although sometimes not very practical from a user standpoint) The rooms were clean, was allowed to check in early and the location is spectacular as the central station with the tube lines is a 3 minute walk out the door. One issue I have is that the desk could not answer a question about recieving VAT back because &quot;I never did it myself&quot; answered the British European Union citizen. Don't waste your money or palate on the resturant. Aside from that everything was wonderful."
426,1040,"May 31 2004	The best deal we had in Europe	I booked this hotel for a three night stay based on reviews I read on Trip-Advisor and what a great deal (booked on internet). It was truely the nicest hotel we stayed at in Europe (and we paid $400 for a hotel for one night in Paris). It was clean, had a wonderfull bathroom and was comparable to hotel room sizes in the U.S. It was so nice to see a real ice machine and not be afraid to use it. The only complaint about our room was that the beds were terribly soft, but after three weeks of sleeping on hard beds, it was &quot;almost&quot; nice. Breakfast is very hardy, but make sure you get it included, otherwise it is 12 pounds per person. We took the buses or tube everywhere. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
427,1040,"May 31 2004	Fantastic London Hotel	This was mine and my boyfriends first trip to England, and what a great time we had. The capital is fantastic with great history and culture, and plenty to see.Victoria Park Plaza was an excellent choice in hotel. Great modern facilities, with a wicked open planned lobby, reception, bar and resturant - and a very nice gym in the basement, with a sauna and steam room.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. A tall handsome chap with short dark hair (sorry can't remember your name) was keen to ensure that we were given a great room for a week long stay, and was totally unphased by the fact that two guys wanted to share a king size bed.The room itself was clean and spotless, great size and fantastic bathroom with a big tub and seperate shower cubical. Nice toiletries and soft towels. Great maid service.We didn't get a chance to eat in the restuarant or bar, cause we decided to eat out every night, but the breakfast was really tasty every morning.The only downside was that we booked over the Park Plaza website and it didn't state that tax was not inclusive... we only found this out on check-in, so the room price was more than we expected. Perhaps something they could think about and either make it more clear or more importantly include it in the room price!Thanks for a great stay."
428,1040,May 28 2004	great hotel	I recently traveled to London with my daughter. We loved the hotel. The bathroom and the shower were sparkling clean and the room was large enough. Location was great. The pastry at the small deli attached was great also. The hotel bar was wonderful after a day of sightseeing to relax and read or write postcards. Not a lot of channels on tv. Staff was helpful and friendly. I would definately stay there again and highly recommend it.
429,1040,May 28 2004	Fantastic VALUE Hotel	Top value hotel in a central location. Had no hiccups whatsoever. The rooms were spotless and the hotel seemed brand new which is something of a rarity in London. One tip - don't get breakfast included but instead go out the hotel entrance and turn left then walk up the street and there are a few excellent breakfast places.
430,1040,"May 20 2004	Another happy guest	I have been watching the reviews for 5 months now so I had a pretty good idea what to expect. The hotel truly is in a most convenient location (you can walk to many of the major attractions and the Tube is less than 2 blocks away. We had only a basic twin room (no executive extras), but the room was large and comfortable, the bathroom modern and sparkling clean. I especially appreciated the US electrical outlet (although having a mirror nearby would have been convenient for using my curling iron.All the basics are available (wall safe, iron/ironing board, hairdryer, tea &amp; coffee)...much appreciated.We met only friendly and efficient staff. My only suggestion would be that they might give a little more information to the guests checking in: whether breakfast is included (we knew enough to ask), mention the existance of the health club downstairs, perhaps point out that the key card is required to make the lights work (obvious when you know about it, but I can see some people being confused at first), etc.Overall, I would rate this hotel highly and would DEFINITELY stay there again."
431,1040,"May 20 2004	The best travel bargain in London...Victoria Park Plaza	What a wonderful hotel experience! I and a friend had booked 7 days at the Victoria Park Plaza on hotels. We had requested smoking rooms that were adjacent or connecting above the 3rd floor on the east side of the building. This may sound picky but these requests were based on reviews from trip advisor and other travel sources. We arrived at the hotel about 2:00pm There we found no que. There were, however. 4 bright young adults behind the check-in counter The person that immediately helped us was a young guy named Bailey. He did everything he could to find us two rooms with the above criteria. When it became apparent that he could not find us connecting rooms he UPGRADED us into small suites at no extra charge!! He was very apologetic that connecting rooms were not availabe and seemed quite concerned that we be pleased with larger rooms on separate floors. We paid apporximately $150.00 US dollars per night for reservations at the Park Plaza which is VERY inexpensive for a higher end property in central London. That is less than 85 pounds per night yet we found ourselves in upgraded rooms. And what rooms they were....good sized, wonderfully appointed, huge windows that OPENED, spotless in every manner, with the most amazing bathrooms I have ever seen. I am a 6ft tall, 220 pound man who hasn't been able to take a bath in a tub since I was a kid. The tubs at the Victoria Park Plaza are HUGE! Buy some of the Queen's Lavender Bubble Bath at the Buckingham Palace shop and enjoy a soak in the Park Plaza's tubs. Quite an experience! We also had a separate shower in these black and white tiled baths. Very impressive. The rooms also had electronic safes of good size, BBC and CNN on the telly, nice sofas, big desks and most importantly, each of our rooms had huge, wonderfully comfy king sized beds. My room, on the 7th floor also benefitted from something that one would not expect in London.... a view! Room 748 faces east, 2 stories beneath your line of site on the opposite side of the street, is a beautiful Victorian red brick and stone building. There are shops on the ground floor and apartments on floors 1-4. On the roof of this ornate grand dame of the 19th century are all the chimney stacks right out of Mary Poppins! Above and to the left in your view you see the incredibly colorful tower of Winchester Cathedral two blocks away. Center in your view is Westminster Cathedral, Big Ben, The London Eye, and all of centrral London. Quite a view! The 7 day stay was exceptional. Everything worked in the rooms, the restaurant was very good (if pricey, but that is London) and the hotel staff was REALLY helpful in answering questions, calling cabs, giving directions and generally being a 4 star hotel staff. This hotel even is enviromentally cutting edge. You insert your key card in a special slot by the inside of your door when you go into the room. This turns the electricity on in your room. It also means that when you leave you don't have to worry about turning any lights off or the telly.....when you leave the room everthing turns off automatically when you take your key card with you as you leave. Pretty neat! If you are going to spend your vacation in London and you want a great hotel the Victoria Park Plaza cannot be beat! Located in Westminster, less the one block from Victoria station, you can train to all of SE England. Victoria Line of London's great underground is there as well.There are 50 shops of every stripe in the great umbrella roof of Victoria train station. Two of London's fabulous theatres are within two blocks of the hotel as are numerous pubs and restaurants. Finally, for bus travel outside of London the Victoria Bus Station is just a few blocks south of the hotel. Have as good a time in London at the Victoria Park Plaza as we did!"
432,1040,"May 17 2004	Huge modern bathroom	The ample bedroom size and especially the huge bathroom are major reasons to pick this hotel. Even if the only time you spend in the room is sleeping, you'll still treasure not bumping into the walls every time you turn around. And there's plenty of room to open out luggage and to work at the desk. I've paid more to stay in London but have never been this comfortable on a business trip. A short walk to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Express are major pluses. Staff were helpful and courteous. Lots of electrical outlets, including US and EU plugs. Everything is modern and it all works! I look forward to staying there again."
433,1040,"May 17 2004	Loved Victoria Park Plaza	We just returned from a one week trip to London (May 6-13)and chose the Victoria Park Plaza based on the excellent reviews found on this site. We loved this hotel! We took the Gatwick Express train from Gatwick airport to Victoria Station and walked a block down the road with our luggage. The room was awesome! We had been upgraded to an executive room with a king-sized bed, couch and coffee table, desk area, etc. The bathroom was wonderful with a large tub, big enough for a great soak after long days of site seeing. The room was always clean. We asked for extra towels and the maid put them in the bathroom every day of our stay. The continental breakfast was basic - rolls, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, tea but fine for our needs. The concierge was always helpful and even got a taxi at 5:00 a.m. for us when we needed to get to Waterloo Station to get the train to Paris. We cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It was great (and we had washcloths every day!)."
434,1040,"May 13 2004	Where are the washcloths?	Nice hotel, but really for the business traveler. The locations was okay, but I would much rather stay in Kensington where the atmosphere is better. We paid for a superior room, which is what we got. It was a nice size room with a king size bed, but, the washcloths are reserved for those in more expensive rooms. We were actually told this when we inquired about them. Huh?"
435,1040,"May 6 2004	Victoria Park Plaza is Awesome!!	I stayed 4 nights at the Victoria Park Plaza in late April 2004 - everything was wonderful. I'd been warned of the room sizes in London, this room was more than spacious and the bathroom was fabulous! The location is excellent - within 5 minutes you can be on the underground to anywhere in the city. The staff was very friendly and the room was always cleaned promptly. I have nothing but fond memories of my stay and would recommend this hotel to all! Thank You Victoria Park Plaza."
436,1040,"May 4 2004	Mostly pluses a few minuses	We booked the Victoria Park Plaza for a week in April based primarily on outstanding TripAdvisor reviews. Our experience, for the most part, was pleasant &amp; positive, with a few concerns. The location is excellent, right by Victoria Station - we used the Tube and buses to cover the entire city with week-long transit passes. We had no problem with early check-in, arriving at about noon on the Saturday before the Marathon - the hotel &amp; staff were quite busy, but unfailingly polite. Our initial room was large &amp; clean, but on the second night , the power went out - not once, but three times, the last at about 10 pm! Not the whole building, just one block of rooms on our floor. After some initial reluctance, the staff moved us to a smaller room on our floor - they brought up new keys, but offered no help with our luggage, or any compensation for the dislocation. The included continental breakfast was adequate, not very appealing, except for the fresh juice &amp; fruit. To upgrade to a full breakfast would have cost an additional 4 pounds/person, or almost $8 ea - hardly worth it. We often brought up food from a nearby Marks &amp; Spencer just to save money. We enjoyed the daily tea &amp; biscuits, and made use of the ironing board and hairdryer. The beds were comfortable, but we found the modern decor a bit bland &amp; bare. Although the hotel is just a couple of years old, we noticed signs of untended wear-and-tear: scruffy, stained carpets, a bathroom door handle that came off in my hand, an odor emanating from a partially clogged sink drain. Easily remedied, but in need of attention. Will we go back? Possibly yes, but more for the location than anything else."
437,1040,"May 4 2004	Poo-poo to the naysayers- this place is great!	I stayed here for two nights a week ago. There were a few hiccups in the beginning (a slow check in and two twin beds instead of a queen), but they took care of it without a problem. My new room was much better and quite large. I did not have the daily breakfast because I thought it was over-priced, so I can't comment on that. The concierge was extremely helpful (cute blond guy) and gave me some good suggestions on tours. I think the time they really shined was at check-out. I was mistaken on when my flight was taking off and only had 1 hour and five minutes before TAKE OFF!! I had not even packed. They checked me out of the hotel, called and put me in a cab literally within four minutes. Bear in mind there is no taxi stand at the hotel and they were so quick and professional. I actually made the flight and was so pleased with their service.As a side note, the location was great. Not as central as I would have liked, but safe and the tube was a 5 minute walk. On the same street, there's also the Apollo Victoria Theatre where Bombay Dreams is showing and I highly recommend seeing it. Safe travels!"
438,1040,"May 1 2004	Love it!!!!!!	We moved to Victoria Park Plaza Hotel after our horrible first night at another shabby hostel in the neighbourhood, which totally ruined our first day in London. Victoria Park Plaza Hotel came as the rescue! It was super comfortable, you can't believe how big the room (standard) is, especially given it's in London. What impressed us most is the super-freindly and highly-efficient receptionists -- Thank you very much! The price is also very reasonable for a four-star hotel located in such a golden location: Only 3 minutes walk from the Victoria tube station/train station! It was such a pleasant stay at Victoria Park Plaza Hotel. Will definitely come again next time in London! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO OTHER TOURISTS OR WHOEVER WHO WANT TO MAKE THEIR STAY IN LONDON MORE GLAMOUROUS!!!"
439,1040,"Apr 28 2004	Two recent (March 	Simply a *GREAT* deal for the money. Rather &quot;W&quot; in style and crazy-affordable for the quality and location. Excellent, central location at the heart of the city and steps from major Victoria Station. Nice staff. No problems. I've stayed twice recently and would seek a room there EVERY time I go to London from now on! Nice, clean, up-to-date, modern and stylish decor...everything functional, nothing broken or in need of attention. I read a few of the other reviews and the negatives kinda' sounded silly to me. From my humble point of view, there are a few things to remember when traveling: First, things are different in different parts of the world (isn't that THE reason to go in the fist place? Otherwise, go to Epcot). Second, big, established, destination-cities like NY &amp; London are expensive. So if you want five stars, be prepared to pay. Otherwise, this place is a winner. :-)"
440,1040,"Apr 20 2004	Best I've stayed in!	Booked an executive room, got upgraded to an appartment. Absolutely gorgeous. Helpfull staff who really smiled (unlike most London hotels). Very clean room(s) with modern decor and quality fittings. A perfect base for our London weekend - will be back again soon. PS - The restaurant food was excellent and the staff very attentive. Thankls for a good stay."
441,1040,"Apr 16 2004	Good Internet connection	The front desk staff were a little distant and didn't go out of their way but overal above average. I was on a working vacation and required a reliable Internet connection. The first day when I plugged in my electrical adaptor smoke came out of it. I called the front desk and they rushed someone up who checked the voltage and then quickly whent to a nearby store and gave me a new adapter. Midway through the stay our keys were accidently deactivated. Also the internet connection whent down - they sent their IT guy right up- determined the entire hotel network was down and fixed the problem. The connection was 12 pounds per day, about 150K/min, no wireless and reliable. The rooms are clean and modern- (limited TV channels)"
442,1040,"Apr 11 2004	Victoria Park Plaza Why all the great reviews?	Just got back from a stay at the Victoria Park Plaza from April 3rd to the 7th. I chose this hotel for my family of four after reading such great reviews on TripAdvisor. I really had high hopes. After flying from the states all night I assured my wife that we could arrive at the hotel around 11:30AM and probably check in early. After all I had read this many times on the reviews. The same blond haired concierge that I have read about in the recent reviews informed us that 2PM is the check in time and to come back at that time. After touring for 3 hours we got into our rooms. Now since this was our first time to Europe I don't know how to compare them. The rooms were medium in size, the bathrooms very large. I don't understand the design of the shower doors because there was no way of avoiding a small flood on the bathroom floor everytime someone took a shower. I did not hear much outside noise because our windows had a beautiful view of an office building just a few feet away (we could read their computer screens). The door key in the light switch was strange but if it conserves energy I can live with it. The bed itself was just fair, my side of the bed leaned on an angle to the floor. The continental breakfast was included with our room, thank goodness, buy itself it would have been $24 and consisted of cereals, fruit, juices, bread and sweet rolls. The hot breakfast was extra, we passed on that. The concierge was ok. That means he wasn't the great, let me help you, cheerful type of person you would expect. He was just ok, answering plainly whatever you had the nerve to ask. The hotel itself was contempoary in design which we knew about and were fine with , although some of the artwork was funky. The front desk staff were not overly friendly, but just ok and were nice enough to allow us a late check out of 1:30PM. The location was a positive. Great location next to Victoria Station with trains or buses to take you anywhere. As I stated before this was our first trip to Europe and althogh the hotel experience was not bad...it was just average. If I ever return to London, I probably would not stay there again."
443,1040,"Apr 8 2004	RudeRude Rude!	My husband and I just got back from a 4 night stay at the Victoria Park Plaza and boy do I have a lot to say. I read all the good reviews about this place and was very excited to go. Upon arrival (11:00am) We were not allowed to check in. The front desk informed us that check in time is at 2:00pm and to come back later. After being up all night my husband and I decided to walk to the Victoria Station and then off to hyde park we went. When we got back to the hotel at 1:50pm The Rude front desk clerk (Blond Hair Girl) had told us we were lucky to get the room we got. That check in time is not until 2:00pm. When we got to the room it was hot. We called down to have someone come up to help fix but was told that the air was broke and that we would have to prop the window open. We did. The noise from outside was very loud all night long. Construction was going on until 12:00 The next day we asked if we could get our room changed and talked to Ryan the manager, He said he would take care of it. He said to go and enjoy our day and when we get back to check at the front desk for our new room number. We went out came back around 4:00pm. Front desk clerk (Blond again) Insisted that we inform her why we needed a room change Rudely I may add. I told her we already cleared this with Ryan and that the room was Horrible. Another clerk heard me and came over to help the Snippy chip on her shoulder Blond out. We were taken to the 9th floor at another corner of the building. It was still loud but we decided there was nothing more the Hotel could do. I suggest that they have a little more training in the customer service dept. Also wr were not aware of any breakfast service for us until the last day we were there. They could of mentioned this to us. I do want to say that the coffee shop called &quot;The Mix&quot; had incredible coffee and pastries. Nice service to. All in all the front desk here needs major help. I have always relied on trip advisors candid reviews of hotels. I am being very honest when I say for the price you could find a much more customer orientated facility in London than this one. Look out there anywhere and you will find it."
444,1040,"Apr 8 2004	Enjoyed our stay at Victoria Park Plaza	This was our first trip to England and Victoria Park Plaza was a wonderful choice as a hotel for first-timers. We chose this hotel after researching reviews on tripadvisor. We also stayed at two other hotels during our stay with which we can compare our room and this room exceeded our expectations. We were not disappointed.We were allowed to check in early, apprx. 10:30 am and we were expecting a room with two twin beds and received a king-size bed at no extra charge (and we got a deal on this room at $130 a nite). The room was spacious even on US terms, as I was prepared for the commonly smaller european hotel room described in many other reviews. The room was smoky at first but opening the window cleared that up quickly, and it did not linger in the linens or carpet. (For those with allergies, they do have non-smoking options, we just had no preferences when checking in.) The room otherwise was very clean; the bathroom was clean with nice modern glass sink and deep bathtub; the service was friendly and helpful altho seemingly understaffed. The hotel is modern and contemporary, much to our liking, and the extra facilities of fitness center, sauna/steam room were nice. The best was its location, literally steps from the Victoria Station for train and bus access and walking distance to Buckingham. Plenty of life in this central London location with eateries, internet cafe, and a theater nearby. We were not disturbed by any noise, and we had room service the first night and our meals were delicious (even if a little overpriced).There were only a few negatives: the towels (some still stained, no washcloths, we brought our own towels), TV (no options, but who's here to watch TV, right?), the light (powered by leaving your room key in a slot by the door, we're new here, is that common or is this part of a modern hotel? But once powered, there was many options of lighting from ambient to task lighting), and the phone (local calls are charged to the room at out-of-this-world rates! Better to use a payphone.) These few negatives were really small details if you ask me, the positives definitely outweighed all of these. The beds were comfortable, room clean and spacious and location is excellent... We would definitely stay here again."
445,1040,"Apr 8 2004	What a wonderful hotel!	We stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza 3/22-24/04 and will stay there again next time we visit London. First, we asked for a larger room and were upgraded (free of charge) to an executive room. The staff was friendly, the rooms large, plush and clean and the hotel was VERY QUIET. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the Victoria train station where you can catch the Tube all over London. It's also a short cab ride (14 pounds) from the main train station where you come into from outside of London. Great hotel &amp; great value, especially if you check early enough on websites like hotels dot com."
446,1040,Apr 7 2004	Disappointing service- poor value for money	very disappointed. RUde concierge. Little or no concept of customer service. £140 for the executive room was excessive. had to keep chasing up reception for service. they did not automatically give us the exec lounge key when we checked in. If we had not read about the lounge we would have never known what was on offer for the price we were paying.Eastern european staff a little friendlier but the English concierge behaved and looked more like a bouncer at a nightsclub stopping customers from revisiting. I felt he was going to punch me - such was his aggressive manner.
447,1040,"Apr 6 2004	Modern Business Hotel With Some Rough Edges	My friend and I recently returned from a seven-night stay at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel. Located in a block bounded by Vauxhall Bridge Road, Wilton Road and Gillingham St., the Park Plaza is very convenient to the Victoria RR station and the Victoria tube stop (both 2 blocks away) and the Victoria Coach station. Buckingham Palace, Green Park, St. James's Park, Whitehall and the Tate Britain are all within easy walking distance. (We took the National Express coach from Heathrow Terminal #4 to and from the Victoira Park Plaza, but would not recommend it to anyone! Take a taxi - or the tube if you can negotiate the escalators involved in transferring from the line from Heathrow.)We had a second-floor Executive Room overlooking Gillingham during our stay. We booked a package deal through Expedia in early November and paid approx. $185. a night for our room. The room resembled a Holiday Inn Express in terms of size and layout. The lighting in the room was a bit inadequate, but the storage was fine for a week's stay. The two twin beds were small but comfortable; the linens were clean and attractive. The bathroom was very nice - plenty of hot water, a very nice sink area and a deep tub (which would be difficult for some people to get into!) The towels were a bit scarce, esp. the washcloths. The complimentary toiletries were a nice touch! The TV has a very limited selection, but the screen was large enough for the room.The breakfast bar was very filling and nutritious. The nightly wine and beer service was OK. The health club is very nice and very clean ...esp. an under-used steam room.The service at the hotel was uneven and occasionally lacking. The staff seems a bit inexperienced. The temperature control was also inadequate: the heat was still on during the first part of our stay and the hotel was too warm. The location is a noisy one, so it was inconvenient opening the small window for some air."
448,1040,Apr 5 2004	poor customer service with no follow up to my complaint ever !	I attended a conference held in the Park Plaza &amp; hosted by the Royal college of general peactitioners. At this conference a box of my papers &amp; display materials including a valuable training pack was &quot;lost&quot; by the hotel cloakroom staff. Although the staff concerend on the day seemed effficient &amp; courteous. There were many procedures to comply with when checking in belongings to the cloakroom &amp; this assured me things would be looked after. I was even required to sign in empty boxes! I then witnessed the banquetting manager bullying staff during the course of the day. I have registered my complaint via the internet &amp; written to the manager. Although I have recvceived several phone calls in which I simply had to re-iterate my complanit to several different people no one has ever contacted me with a sufficient response or offered any compensation. Considering the look of this hotel the service is lacking &amp; I would not consider staying there myself or using it for clients.
449,1040,"Apr 4 2004	Good clean fun	My mother, my cousin, two of her friends and I just came back from 5 nights/6 days in London and used the Victoria Park Plaza as our home away from home. The hotel was well appointed and clean. The staff--especially our young concierge, Dan-- made the trip especially nice. Being novices to the city and only armed with a copy of &quot;London for Dummies&quot;, we relied on the staff's recommendations and were never disappointed. If you are visiting London for all London has to offer--I highly recommend the Victoria Park Plaza for a no nonsense home base."
450,1040,Apr 3 2004	class style and value	stayed here late march for 2 nights - very nice hotel - stylish furnishings/comfy beds/lovely bathrooms/well located/good price thro hotels.com only 2 slight criticisms - had to phone reception and ask for room to be made up after first night at 3pm as they had forgotten but rapidly attended to and courtesy call to check - same problem with mini bar as others - merely opening it seems to charge items automatically to your room but again reception rapidly sorted it out - could thoroughly recommend victoria park plaza to all
451,1040,"Apr 2 2004	Nice but.....	I read the reviews below and can agree with most things said. I just recently spent 8 days there. It is a nice place, the location is great but I believe that the service is a bit lacking. I am under the impression the hotel is new and so are all the staff. The computers were also down upon my arrival. The room needed a few repairs, like the curtain track was hanging down and curtain pull rods off the curtains. I told the cleaning staff, who informed me that was not their job and I should inform the front desk myself. No big deal I guess, but I would think they work for the Hotel as well. Some other items were not repaired at all. Some ammenities were not in the room and I had to ask to have them brought up, it seemed a chore for the staff to do so, they brought some, not others and I never did get them. I only request for things once so it was my loss. JB's bar in the lobby seems to be a very difficult place to get a drink. The waiters very seldom come to the table and when you go to the bar, you seem to be interupting their socializing. The young folks at the Concierge desk were a tremendous help. They answeres all questions and had excellent recommendations. I am putting the negative things down to growing pains and when they get it together it will be the first class Hotel it wants (or claims) to be."
452,1040,"Mar 25 2004	Super weekend	We've just returned from a weekend in London staying at the Victoria Park Plaza. This is a lovely hotel, very centrally situated - we were able to walk virtually everywhere we wanted to. We would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to friends who will be staying at Easter.We filled in the customer questionnaire and made one or two suggestions (not criticisims!) and when we got home we received a letter thanking us for taking the time to do so and entering us for a draw. This is a first for us - we always fill in the questionnaires wherever we go - but we have NEVER received a response until now. Well done Victoria Park Plaza."
453,1040,"Mar 24 2004	Great Location Good Hotel	Our family of four stayed at the hotel for nine nights... from March 12th through the 21st. It was the hotel we chose as part of a go-today package. The hotel was very nice, modern decor. The rooms were a nice size with a great bathroom. We upgraded when we checked in to the executive level. For 25 extra pounds (for the whole stay) we had access to the executive lounge where we had breakfast and also early evening wine, beer and snacks. It was well worth the money. The executive card key gave us access to the room 24 hours a day. There is a cappucino machine we definately took advantage of. The hotel itself is located just two blocks from the Victoria train and underground station. And there are several restaurants and a grocery store (Sainsbury's) within a couple of blocks as well. We would definately stay here again."
454,1040,"Mar 18 2004	Very Nice Hotel in Great Location	I stayed at this property Mar 3- Mar 10. Overall, I was very impressed. The only problem I had was a tendency for the room to overheat. The minibar functioned perfectly, contrary to some of the reviews here. The bed was very comfortable. The pillows were the same as any hotel. (I always find hotel pillows too hard, so I bring small pillows with me). Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was thoroughly cleaned and stocked daily. I found the American outlet at the desk to be a great feature. No need for converters or adaptors to plug in the laptop and digital camera. The laptop sized safe was also a plus. The location was just minutes from all Victoria transportation and a short walk to Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace and many other attractions. There were many restaurants, pubs and fast food outlets in the vicinity. I would definitely stay here again."
455,1040,"Mar 13 2004	Modern-Great location	This hotel was a pleasant surprise. I just got back, was there from Mar. 6-12. I got a rate from Hotels.com for $150 per night. The room was large with a king bed &amp; modern bath. The location was very good, only a 8 min. walk from the Victoria bus station &amp; a 2 min. walk from the Victoria tube. There are many restaurants in the area &amp; 2 theaters. I won't use the phone in the room because they charge 1 1/2 pounds ($2.75) per min. even for a toll free call"
456,1040,"Mar 11 2004	Nice but some strange quirks	I got a room in the Park Plaza through Hotels for $135 a night. The room was terrific, large, clean, it had the first beds in my stay in europe that were firm and soft. the Bathroom was really great, very large with a Bath that you would actually like to take a bath in. I would give it an excellent review if not for a few quirks. The front desk's computers were down for several hours when we got in and were on off the fritz for our stay. Half of the hotel is devoted to apartments. Our room was next to one of these and we heard doors slamming all night long. The room was very warm, the windows couldn't open much and there was no way to cool down. The neighborhood is pretty loud at night. You need to put a credit card down to use the mini bar, fairly standard procedure, but it is controlled by the front desk and we never could get it open. I bought some pudding and milk that I wanted to keep cold and some one had to be sent up to manually open it, and then as soon as it was closed it would lock again. The staff was rather curt and told us to prop it open all night because they would not come back to open it again. When we checked out we were told that there was a 7 pound charge for using the mini bar, even though we were never able to. I really enjoyed my room but don't think that I would stay there again."
457,1040,"Mar 1 2004	Nothing that Special...	I guess my review isn't really in line with the rest of the others here but I need to be honest about the few (granted not many) flaws I found.1) Bed and Pillow comfort. Yes I know it seems a bit picky, but the hardness of the pillows and over all comfort provided was terrible and even though we were there for one weekend....it was difficult getting to sleep....THIS IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM HERE......yes everything is modern, nice tv and lovely bathroom....but the other reviews forgot to mention this very important point..2) Mini bar refused to open (after 3 attempts to query at the Reception) we told to keep checking it would be activated soon....we gave up at the finish up...Ok that was 2 flaws but to me quite important to the overall experience. I hate being fussy and picky (OVERALL the trip was very good)Maybe I expected too much- the reviews painted too good a picture for the hotel to live up too??Would I return? Doubtful....if they got new beds and new softer pillows then yes...."
458,1040,"Feb 24 2004	Great Modern London Hotel	Stayed here last week while on vacation, selected based on previous tripadvisor.com comments. Very nice hotel in the center of London near Victoria Station and Underground (2 block walk), a 21st century hotel with cool modern art deco. Super modern rooms with huge (American-Style) bathrooms, high-speed internet access also. Had UK / EU / and USA outlets. Comfortable rooms / beds. Very professional staff. Excellent English / Continental Breakfast. Very clean (2-3 yrs old). Had a nice health club as well. 5 minute walk to Buckingham, 10 minutes to Westminster / Thames. Would highly recommend and would return to in the future."
459,1040,"Feb 23 2004	Fantasic hotel at a great price!	We booked this hotel through the Internet and didn't really know what to expect. We were so pleasantly surprised! The reception area is really spacious and very modern and chic. The room was very spacious, very clean and again very modern. The bathroom had a gorgeous glass sink and heated mirrors that did not steam up even during a hot shower! I can't think of anything bad about this hotel - the room was quiet, the staff were friendly and it was in an ideal central location with the Victoria Tube Station just a two minute walk away. We will definitely be staying here again."
460,1040,"Feb 16 2004	very nice	Beautifull hotel with spacious rooms, very comfortable beds.Breakfast was a hugh choice of cereals, fruits, pasteries, eggs, fish, fruit salads,..Very helpfull and friendly staff.The best place I've ever stayed in London."
461,1040,"Feb 4 2004	Luxury near Victoria Station	I was excited to stay at this property after first reading the excellent reviews on the site and then taking advantage of a ridiculously good deal on a travel discount site (so good in fact that i had to call the site to make sure the price quoted was indeed in American dollars and not Pounds). In any event, we enjoyed a teriffic stay. The room was spacious and the American power outlet at the desk was great - i didn't even need to use the power converter i brought. The bathrooms were both super-modern and very European. What few glitches we found (small selection of TV stations, the minibar wouldn't unlock and charged us for dislodging an item in trying to open it, the keycard got deprogrammed once) were definitely outweighed by the great positives: amenities, location and service. If flying into Gatwick, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more convenient and hassle-free trip to a hotel than to hop the Gatwick Express and walk the block and a half from Victoria Station to the hotel. We would definitely return."
462,1040,"Feb 1 2004	Heavenly	My stay here on the weekend of January 2 was the best in London I have ever had. Besides the location (near bus, tube, rail and places of interest) the best thing about the hotel is its staff. Extremely friendly and helpful. Thank you (Danny, Dan en Leonard especially) for the best weekend in my life. Benjamin Smith"
463,1040,"Jan 20 2004	Great Location!	I recently spent 2 nights here and it was a great way to begin my European trip. The hotel was very clean and modern and the neon lights in the elevators were a cool touch.The room was okay in size, what you'd find in a typical hotel. We were on the first floor and we had no view at all. A continental breakfast is served and for 4 pounds you can upgrade to a full breakfast with all the food Americans are accustomed to.Best part of the hotel was the location as the Victoria Tube stop is conveniently located around the corner. When choosing a hotel, you always want one near the Metro."
464,1040,"Jan 10 2004	Wonderful staying	I had been staying at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel for a week and I am fully satisfied of its top quality of services and facilities. The room I got was just a standard one, but it was surprisingly large as well, well-furnished, full-equipped and clean. The ambiance of Victoria Park Plaza Hotel is a benchmark for its extreme high quality and comfort. In addition to all that, it is perfectly located close to main London attractions (such as Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square, Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square, Kensington and so on)."
465,1040,"Jan 6 2004	Great hotel great location	I am always skeptical about hotel reviews on web sites but I booked the Victoria Park Plaza based on the reviews on this web site and I am happy I did. We checked in at 12:30pm and the room was ready. It was a beautiful room with a striking bathroom. The room had a minibar, ironing board, iron, and in-room safe. Staff was courteous, the concierge was great - There was not one disappointing thing about the hotel."
466,1040,"Jan 5 2004	Very nice but there are nicer	Very nice modern hotel. Tries to be &quot;hip&quot; and succeeds in many ways. Very clean and quiet floors. Room was spacious and pretty nice. Staff were less than helpful and, thankfully, I really didn't need them too much. Location is great. Got this hotel through Priceline which is the only way I'd go to this hotel again; not because I didn't like it, but because it was extremely expensive otherwise (even from the so-called discount web sites)."
467,1040,"Dec 31 2003	Highly recommended!	I booked this hotel (4 rooms) through an internet site at low rates and am so glad I did! We were checked in on arrival (before 2pm) and the concierge desk gave excellent recommendations for restaurants (try the Boisdale). You can't beat the proximity to Vic Station. All of our rooms had safes and a continental breakfast (pastries, cereals, toast, fruits, coffee/tea/juices) was included. One of our rooms was an Executive Room which came with access to the Exectutive Lounge where you could get a hot breakfast in the a.m., newspapers, fruit, beer/wine, coffee at any hour. Our party of eight was extremely satisfied with our stay."

Received a lovely, spacious king-size room, with a mini-bar and several other comfortable amentities. The room and bathroom were clean and well-maintained during our stay. The front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. We didn't get to enjoy the hotel restaurant, but can recommend the coffee shop. MIX offers a nice variety of breakfast pastries, beverages, and/or sandwiches to start the day. The &quot;location was perfect&quot; with Victoria Station, the tube, bus terminal, and tour companies within a short, easy walking distance."

1,1049,"Sep 27 2009 	Kim and Aggie would not like it here.	Place really grotty. Good location and staff did their best. Good atmosphere in the pub. However, I would not return and I wouldn't recommend it"
2,1049,"Feb 3 2009 	Ideal for solo traveller	I stayed for 6 nights in a room above the pub. It had a wetroom with a loo and shower, a full length mirror, small bench, chair and lamp, and a double bed, facing a TV complete with Sky. It is a very small room, but ideal for someone who wants a place to sleep in central London, who does not want to hostel it. The building was quite secure, and the room was cleaned spotlessly each day, with towel and linen changes. Big props to housekeeping. Actually, all of the staff I spoke to were extremely pleasant and helpful. Continental breakfast each day was pretty good, with expresso coffee or a pot of tea.The downside is that my room, on the left hand side of a corridor, faced an alley way opposite airconditioning units from other buildings and exhaust pipes from various restaurant kitchens in the area, so if the window was left open, the room smelt faintly of burnt chip oil. And the window had to be left open, because of the oppressive heat, with one small portable fan.But all in all, it was a good experience, and for the price, you are not likely to get better in London."
3,1049,"Sep 15 2008	location is the best point	I've been wanting to stay at this place for a long time, and finally managed to have a visit over the weekend. We asked for a room not on the street (noise) and were booked in number 2. Basically, the room was small, which is FINE. But it faced a noisy generator and the room was boiling hot. The heating was not on so we assume it was related to something outside or over the kitchen. (When I checked out I was told this had never come up, which my partner and I found stunning; it was stuffy and boiling and cool outside!) My main complaint is that the room was very sub-standard. If they had taken the time to make the room feel well cared for - extra nice bedding, a comfy bed (not one with springs sticking into my ribs), decent shower products - then I can overlook the other issues. Instead it was a big dingy and felt like staying in a hostel. for those who don't mind this is fine, but for those who feel spending $140 for a night is a lot, this will feel like a bit of a rip-off (and a bit depressing). The best point of course, is the location - walking out on to Portobello market on a saturday; and the continental breakfast was very nice and the staff very chill and relaxed."
4,1049,"Aug 27 2008 	Good for solo travelers	The Gold is pretty close to Notting Hill tube and there are a couple of cafes and day market nearby. I was traveling alone but felt safe to be around the area. The room is small but reasonable, can't ask much with such price. The only downside is the foul smell from the bar downstairs but overall, it's a good choice for singles. Points that you'd like to know:1) It's clean2) Shower area is small but very clean -- There's a daily cleaner3) Don't expect hotel service but the staff are all nice and helpful4) No bugs or roaches so nothing scaryI'll stay there again when I'm back to London."
5,1049,"Jun 25 2008 	A one-off!	Loved this funky, easy-going pub with rooms on the Portobello Road. It's about ten minutes walk from the tube at Notting Hill Gate and has a fab atmosphere. It's noisy and very laid back, so if you are looking for standard bland and anonymous, best go elsewhere. The rooms are small, some of them even tiny, but the staff warn you about that when you book. If you get the four poster room which we did, it's brilliant! The pub is right in the middle of the Portobello Road and you can either get the tube or pick up a bus from just around the corner.Breakfast is very basic, but it's included and if you want something more there are loads of cafes in the area. My only criticism is that the rooms are a bit careworn and could do with redecorating, but the place is otherwise very clean and well kept. There's no air con either, but you can always open the original and very rattly windows ( I loved them, but again, if it's souless and perfect you want, go elsewhere!). The wifi internet access was great too and worked fine for me with none of the problems mentioned in other reviews. I was on my own for a couple of nights until my boyfriend joined me and I felt safe and chilled out by myself. He recommends the olives from the bar, by the way! I found the service amazing, the mostly young staff were wonderful and I can't wait to go back -- which I will!"
6,1049,"Mar 1 2008 	Small but cozy; Great location	A lovely little inn! Located above a pub (but still very quiet at night), the room was small but felt cozy, not cramped and everything was very clean. Ensuite bathroom was really tiny but clean with a small shower stall, sink and toilet. There were a lot of stairs to climb to the rooms, so avoid if you require easier access. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and transportation tips. The location was great! We weren't there on a weekend so we missed the market but still were able to walk Notting Hill and Hyde Park. Plenty of restaurants around and the breakfast served downstairs in the morning was pretty good standard fare- toast, cereal, fresh fruit, juice, coffee/tea. We'll definitely return next time in London!"
7,1049,"Nov 29 2007 	A Place to Stay in Notting Hill - Portobello market area	Stayed here in Oct '07. Takes 10 mins to/from Notting Hill tube station. Except on Saturday where the crowd gathers around 9am-6pm, the neighborhood is quiet. The first two floors are a pub and manager office. There are 7 rooms on the third floor where we stayed. Room 0-3 facing the back of the building, Room 4-6 facing the front where the Saturday action is. The room is really small but clean with adequate amenities. Breakfast, self service, is ready at 8.30, comprises of bread, spreads, cereals, fruits, coffee/tea and millk. Services, provided when asked, are slow especially when the bar is open."
8,1049,"Mar 24 2007 	Not your standard hotel but that's its charm.	My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights in Room 0 aka the Backpacker Room. The rooms at the PG are up at least 2 flights of stairs, so not suitable for the infirm. This is the smallest of the PG's rooms and has a slightly unusual bed arrangement: 1 single raised bed across the room, with 1 single bed (lower) lengthwise. This is a tiny room (approx 6'6&quot; x 9'6&quot;), so do not consider it if you feel claustrophobic. However it has everything you need: ensuite toilet and shower (more about that later), a curtained closet alcove, kettle, tv (small and high up), free wi-fi access and comfy beds. Room rate (70 per night) includes a more than adequate continental breakfast (juice, fruit, coffee, cereal and toast). The negatives: slight draught from the window, and the traditionally english anaemic shower. The ensuite toilet/ shower room is an interesting arrangement: when you enter the narrow room, a small basin is on the right, a shower pan is immediately inside the door and the shower is above the basin. Then there is a step up to the toilet. If you have ever stayed in an english home, you will know that often the hot water pressure is considerably less than the cold water pressure: this makes balancing hot and cold output for a shower an art form, and this shower is no exception. Your choices are lots of cold water, or considerably less warm water: showering can take a while.How you respond to this &quot;inn with rooms&quot; depends on how you feel about the idiosyncratic: this is NOT a full service hotel. Personally, both my daugher and I loved the fact that it was above a neighbourhood pub, and the smallness of the room reminded us of being on a boat. Despite what other reviewers have said, I found the staff both friendly and helpful, and we both enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely stay there again. In fact, I hesitated about posting this review - I wouldn't want it to become so popular that I couldn't get a room next time!"
9,1049,Dec 2 2006	It's OK but very overpriced- tiny room	We stayed here because we wanted to be in Notting Hill. That is the good part. It is right in the middle of Notting Hill near everything. The hotel is above a bar. We were worried about noise but it was fine. The room was the smallest we stayed in on our three-week adventure. The room was as wide as the bed's length. With only three steps to walk in next to the bathroom/shower it was a tight space. The shower head was right above the sink. Weird! The staff was nice and we ate/drank at the bar. The morning breakfast was free.
10,1049,Oct 28 2006	Overpriced Wardrobe!	I recently stayed in this hotel and was appalled at the size of the room. I have stayed in many hotels in London and elsewhere in the UK and have never come across such an excuse for a hotel room. As one reviewer mentioned there was room for an open suitcase on the floor and nothing else. The bathroom was so small that the shower water falls on the toilet and a glass door from the shower to the room gives absolutely no privacy. The noise of the air-conditioning unit directly outside our window kept us awake for most of the night. The person we dealt with in the bar was unfriendly to the point of rudeness. One final point there were no fire notices in the room and no sign of a fire exit even though we were 2 stories up and over a pub. There are far better hotels to be had in this area.
11,1049,"Jul 11 2006	nice room above a bar	We enjoyed our stay at the portobello gold. The staff was friendly and made excellent coffee in the morning. For a continental breakfast it was pretty good, the atrium was a great place to linger over breakfast. It was located in a nice and safe neighborhood close to the tube station. We enjoyed the bar at night, they even stayed open a bit later to accomodate us. The rooms were definately small, but reading the other reviews that was expected. No A/C, which wouldnt be bad if we had normal London weather but we were there in the middle of a heat wave so sleeping in was not an option bc of the heat. OUr last night there was a Friday and it was a bit loud outside and hard to get to sleep.I would recommend this hotel to younger travelers who appreciate good coffee and beer and do not mind trading a tighter space for a cheaper price in London."
12,1049,"Jun 13 2006	Great value great neighborhood	This is a great place place to stay in London -- as long as you understand what you're getting. This is not a hotel -- it's a pub that also happens to have rental rooms upstairs. So if you want a &quot;standard&quot; hotel with a front desk, cookie cutter rooms, dedicated hotel staff, etc. -- this isn't that kind of place. But if you like unique places with local color, this could be a good place for you. One the pro side, this is an &quot;only in Britain&quot; type of place. It's on Portobello road (home of the famous Portobello antiques street market) in the Notting Hill neighborhood. The neighborhood is *fantastic* -- lots of great little shops, wonderful restaurants / bars / pubs, newstands, etc. There aren't any hotels nearby, so you're surrounded by locals, not by other tourists. It was great to be able to come back to the room in the evening, freshen up, and then head out knowing you had dozens of great places to eat and hang out within a few minutes walk. The Gold is right in between two Tube stops -- it's a 10-12 min walk to either station -- and of the two stops, the Notting Hill Tube stop connects to both the Circle and Central lines, so it's super convenient to get into the core of London and the main tourist sites. You're also only a couple of Tube stops (or a 5 pound cab ride) from Paddington train station, which is convenient if you're arriving in Heathrow and you take the Heathrow express into Paddington. The pub itself serves food too, if you want to eat in house. I ate there twice -- first time the food was mediocre, the 2nd time the food was great, so I think it depends on what you order (they have huge menu). It was also nice to be able to get a drink at the bar and take it upstairs to your room, if you didn't want to hang out in the smoky / noisy pub. Note that the Gold doesn't serve breakfast, but there are multiple breakfast places (both sitdown and takeout) in the neighborhood. The rooms are very small, but they weren't any smaller than the budget hotel rooms I've stayed in elsewhere in Europe, Britain or New York City. Rooms were clean and had a TV (with cable -- movies etc), phone, insuite bathroom, hairdryer. The wireless internet in the room is very convenient if you bring your computer -- we used it all the time, the signal was strong and reliable. You can also use their two computers down in the pub for free -- but in the evening when the pub is crowded, it's kind of a hassle. Still, it's better than having to go out and find a cyber cafe every time you want to check your email. You *cannot* beat their price for a London bathroom-insuite room -- we paid 65 pounds for a double. I spent literally 5+ hours online looking for budget hotel rooms in London, and the next cheapest rooms I found were 10-15 pounds more expensive for a typical budget room in cheap hotels in Earls Court or near Victoria Station (ie, the budget tourist ghettos). There are two big tradeoffs. One is that the rooms don't have air conditioning, so if the weather's warm, the rooms can get darn hot even with the window wide open. I did see a tabletop fan on my last day there (too late for my stay, but having a fan could make a big difference). The other tradeoff is the noise. You are right above a pub, and esp in the warmer months, people are hanging around outside drinking and talking. The noise level varies, but you can get some noise until around midnight - 1 am, so if you're sensitive to sound, earplugs might help. The noise kind of bothered me some nights, but not on others, so YMMV. I would definitely stay here again, but probably not in the summer months, because of 1) the heat (rooms could get really hot and stuffy), and 2) the noise from summer outdoor revelers. In the cooler months, this is probably now my top choice of where to stay in London. You really can't beat the price or the neighborhood."
13,1049,"May 25 2006	Not Worth It	My wife and I stayed there this May and had room 4. The only good reviews of this hotel seem to be from people who stayed in the Penthouse on the roof. Our room was very small to say the least. Also, on our last day, the lights went out in our room and there was no one to call.I agree completely with the review that said the employee care more about the bar then the hotel. We did not feel like guests at all, only an inconvience. We asked to use the &quot;free&quot; internet to guests on Saturday and told it was closed on Saturdays. Then we tried on Sunday and apparently they only have one free password for one guest at a time, so my wife and I had to take turns.The hotel notices says you can check out starting at 800am and when we tried to, the manager was not in. We had to wait around till 830 till the manager decided to come to work."
14,1049,"Oct 6 2005	One Of A Kind Gem	We had a great stay at the Portobello Gold. It is an off beat but friendly place. We had the apartment with wounderful rooftop terrace, it was abit tight for 3 adults and 3 kids but a great value at 170- a night. Mellisa and Michael and the rest of the staff were are very kind and helpful. This is not the Holiday Inn, it has real character a great refection of the neighborhood. We will be back."
15,1049,"Oct 4 2005	Is there such a thing as too quaint?	This was the last place we stayed on our trip to Europe, so maybe at this point we were spoiled. The penthouse room sounds lovely, but that isn't where we stayed. Our room was TEENY. There was barely enough room to put our suitcases flat and the bed went from wall to wall. I like being able to relax for a hour after walking all day, and before going to dinner(after walking 8 hours it became a neccessity), but I found I didn't really want to spend any time there. In the end, when you're on a budget, in the UK you can't ask for more. The staff was very nice and the breakfast was great. One more thing...I got a call from my credit card company when we got back to Canada and the hotel had tried to charge my credit card 3 times after I had already paid in full! Fortunately there was no more money left for them to take :). I called the hotel and they fixed the problem right away"
16,1049,"Sep 29 2005	My kind of place; if ""funky"" isn't you book someplace else	This little bed and breakfast, above a bar/restaurant/internet caf on the Portobello Road, is my kind of place. If &quot;funky&quot; isn't you, book someplace else.The Portobello Gold has a wonderful location and, in London, is available for a fair price. The staff is friendly and helpful. It's funky. Part of our group was in the suite - which featured both a fabulous roof-top terrace overlooking the neighborhood and a poorly designed hose-rig in the bathtub for taking a shower. They enjoyed the terrace in the evening, but they took their showers in our small, simple, and somewhat spare room. There is free wireless internet access throughout the facility - it worked flawlessly for me. Breakfast - toast and cereal, coffee or tea - was delicious but wouldn't suit someone that needed bacon and eggs."
17,1049,"Dec 4 2004	Totally fabulous family experience!	This was our family's first trip abroad, and we picked the Portobello Gold because it looked interesting and affordable. We were not at all disappointed! We LOVED the penthouse, which was great for a family (4 of us - I don't really see how more could sleep there), and the pub and restaurant were wonderful also. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed 6 nights, so got to know the pub staff pretty well - it was our habit to go out at night and then stop for a drink (our children are older) before going up to bed. We were perfectly happy with the breakfast arrangements - they said we could eat any time after 8, which was okay with us. There was always someone there who would make as many lattes as I wanted, and the location was great for just walking out the door and getting a delicious croissant at a street vendor if there wasn't something you liked at the hotel. I am so sorry to hear about their fire, as I can't imagine finding as good a bargain anywhere in London - we paid 120 pounds per night, which is half or less than anyplace else I found on the Internet. We all voted the Gold as one of the very best parts of our trip! If you're looking for a Comfort Suites experience, this probably isn't for you, but we couldn't have been happier."
18,1049,"Aug 5 2004	up and down	Its in a good location granted. I think however they need to decide whether they would like to run a hotel or a pub, as it became blattantly apparent during our stay that they werent up to both. The rooms are tiny, there is not enough room to change your mind. The staff were clearly focussed on running a bar and the hotel seemed nothing more than a distraction. Our stay included breakfast. The problem was you had to attack the staff with a wooden stick to raise them from their slumber if you wanted something before miday. Great place to stay if you want a big night in their pub and remain hungover till 6 pm the following the day. If your in London to see the sights find somewhere else."
19,1049,"Jul 1 2004	A real bargain given the location.	Stayed here recently on a Saturday night on a personal recommendation. Was not disappointed.Great location, rooms are above a very friendly bar/restaurant on the antique market.Staff are very friendly and helpful.Rooms are not exactly stately, but perfectly adequate, and a bargain considering we paid 75GBP to stay in W11. Bathroom was tiny and could have done with a lick of paint. Free cable TV was a bonus, but we didnt really watch it !The 'penthouse' which sleeps 6 looks great, would definitely be worth getting a group together and staying there !Restaurant in the back room is lovely - its like being in the palm house at Kew ! We had Sunday lunch which was the best I've had apart from home cooked !We will stay there again if we need to stay over in London."
1,1051,Great stay	
1,1061,"Best value location and rooms all in one	Just got back from our England trip and stayed our last night at the Premier Hotel. It's our second stay there and it's even better than out last trip. Much improved dining area. Great food and Bar. Our room was compact but well appointed and exceptionally clean. The location is great, just off the lively Earls Court road and a 2 minute walk to the tube. Close also to Holland Park and Hyde Park. Parking is always expensive but it's close for short term and long term parking. The staff are excellent and always helpful. We'll be looking to stay there again on our next family visit. It is definitely the best family value around."
2,1061,"Look No futherthis is it!!!	I recently stayed at Premier Inn, Kensington Earls Court and was so pleased with the service that I decided to write my experience so others can go and see it for yourselves. The front desk and restaurant has just been refitted and want a difference!! The reception is now slick with self checking but you still have the traditional reception desk. The restaurant is really nice, relaxing and spacious. But the hidden gem is the team and their customer service. This is felt from all team members, not one person will pass you bye without asking you how is your stay what can we do better. For a no thrills, clean hotel, this is very good."
3,1061,"Nov 24 2009 	Absolutely excellent	This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere, better than others I have paid up to 4 times as much for in London and in the States. Rooms are spotlessly clean, very spacious, extremely comfy bed, excellent air conditioning (not always a given) and large bathroom with plenty of bathroom storage space. The staff always have a smile and are really helpful, both domestic staff, restaurant staff and reception staff. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. The restaurant serves very tasty food and a great choice, both at breakfast and dinner, and Earls Court tube is literally a 3-4 minute easy walk away. There are lots of shops and restaurant/bar choices nearby also, but the very best thing about the hotel is the tremendous value it offers. We had a special offer and paid 130 for 2 nights for 2 people including breakfast - simply excellent!! This hotel is heartily recommended and we can't wait to go back."
4,1061,"Nov 21 2009 	Excellent hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with a friend this September. The staff was incredibly friendly. Both my friend and I were from out of town, and the staff went out of their way to discuss maps and plans around the city with us. We were always greeted with a smile by anyone we met in the hotel.The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. We left in the morning, but everything was always cleaned by the time we returned at night. The hotel has a great location. It is only a few minutes away from the Earls Court subway station and there are plenty of restaurants and shops around. The hotel was going through renovations--redoing their restaurant, I believe--while we were there, but we had a quiet stay night after night, and things were still kept very clean. For a budget hotel, it was an excellent stay, and I would definitely come back."
5,1061,"Nov 13 2009 	Perfect location Great price Great hotel.	Myself and my partner stayed for 2 nights (Fri-Sat). We arrived at 12 on the Fri and check in wasnt unitl 2 , but the girl on reception very kindly allowed us to check in early as a room was available. Our room was spotless, had a nice hot shower, tea/coffee making facilities, extra pillows and quiet at night (couldnt ask for more). About a 3 minute walk up the road is Earls court underground station, which has lines going to all the major attractions. Opposite that is a bakers oven cafe which is ideal if you dont fancy the Premier Inns Brekkie. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, the price for London very reasonable and we certainly wont look to book elsewhere on our next trip to London. Highly recommended ."
6,1061,"Nov 12 2009 	Great Location - Good Value for Money	We stayed here with our 13 year old son for 4 nights Wednesday - Sunday of half-term week in October. Room and beds comfortable - exactly as described. The temperature was fine - I usually suffer in Premier Inn type hotels with being too hot, but this time it was fine. Maid service was lacking. We ran out of toilet rolls and I had to ring for more. I am not sure if the maid missed our room out one day. Replenishing the milk for the tea tray happened after 5 pm on a couple of days and again we ran out of things for this. On Sunday we awoke to pouring rain, and rain started to drip through our window frame on to the carpet. Staff very friendly and enthusiastic on reception.The hotel was fully booked during this week and breakfast was incredibly busy. If you went down after 8.45 am, you would have to wait for a table with lengthy queues forming just to be seated. Mugs, jugs and teapots were in short supply and one day I had to wait 15 minutes for a mug to have a cup of tea, which in my view is not good enough. The variety of food on offer was excellent and couldn't be bettered really. Hot breakfast items were well cooked and of a good standard. Good value for money with kids eating free, pity about the wait for utensils though. Noise - if you have a room on the other side of the road across the bridge, you are away from the railway line. We didn't experience any noise at all where we were on Floor 5, over the bridge. A good location, a couple of minute's walk to the tube station and plenty of restaurants to eat at in the locality. We ate at &quot;The Real Greek&quot; - a very nice meal, one of the most authentic Greek places outside Greece and also at &quot;The Little French restaurant&quot; who do a set menu for 9.95. Again very good. All in all a great place to stay for London. I wouldn't stay in a Premier Inn outside of a city break or airport stop over, but it certainly suited our purpose for a busy few days visiting London. Very good value for money, with the room being slightly bigger than a boutique hotel we stayed at for twice the room rate."
7,1061,Nov 3 2009 	Clean 	We (2 adults and a baby) stayed in Premier Inn-Kensington for 7 nights in October. We stayed in a family room. The hotel is located not very far from Earls Court tube station which is very convenience for us. Our room overlooked the rail track. So we could see and hear the train. But it did not bother us. There are lots of place to eat and some groceries stores nearby. The room was small but clean. The Staff was friendly. There is a Restaurant in the hotel that serves buffet breakfast. But the line was always long.The only drawback was we have to wait for a long time for checking in since we paid by cash. It would be faster if we pay by credit card.We're happy with the hotel.
8,1061,"Oct 25 2009 	friendly hotelgreat location.	stayed here for 2 nights,and was in walking distance to all the places we wanted to visit like meusems,harrods.the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble,the food was good and the breakfast was great value for money,the room was clean and comfortable.its in a nice area and really close to earls court underground.would stay here again."
9,1061,"Oct 24 2009 	Excellent value for money and friendly service	We booked this hotel as we wanted a hotel close to the museums and one that was value for money and suitable for children (6 year old). We weren't disappointed - the hotel far exceeded our expectations.From the other reviews I read, I expected it to be noisy - We couldn't hear any trains or any of the other guests, even though the hotel was fairly full. The room was very clean and a good size for central london with a separate single bed which my daughter said was very comfortable.The breakfast was excellent - Was around 7 each and free for children. The selection and quality was as good as (if not better) than I have paid more than double for in other hotels.All staff were very polite and welcoming and went out of the way to help.All in all a very pleasant overnight stay. I would definitely look into staying in another Premier Inn, especially when travelling as a family."
10,1061,"Oct 21 2009 	Excellent value for money	Stayed at this Premier Inn $ nights in October. Found the staff extremely friendly and helpful, room was very comfortable, and meals were an excellent standard (their sticky toffee pudding is something to die for). Very well located near tube station, and to get to central London on tube is the minimum fare. Will definitely stay there again when visiting London"
11,1061,"Sep 27 2009 	Bargain but definitely 3 star and a bit noisy	I managed to book this at 49 a night through a promotion that Premier Inn are running at the moment. For that price, its a bargain in London, but if I had to stay there again I wouldn't pay anything more than about 65 per night.The location is superb as a few minutes walk to Earl's Court tube station and lots of dining places, all reasonably cheap, around there. Its also a very safe area, and good if you plan to stay out late and walk home late at night.Its also a reasonable 15-20 minute walk to South Kensington area for the museums and such.The lobby of the hotel is very nice, having just been redecorated, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The newly opened restaurant and bar looked very cosy and inviting, but we did not dine there so cannot comment on the food. However, they do have a all-you-can-eat breakfast for 7.50, that you can purchase on the spot (no discount for pre-booking).The rooms are functional, and the air conditioning works very well. We got one of the rooms directly overlooking the train tracks, but there are two sets of thick windows so could not hear ANY train sounds at all! However, the walls are rather thin and you can hear the sound of doors slamming or people talking in the corridor... so you could be unlucky and live on the same floor as a stag party group.One downside is no internet or wifi in the rooms; only a modem connection."
12,1061,Sep 17 2009 	Great location and great value for the money	Ideally located close to Earl's court tube station; got a great rate in Feb; very clean and excellent service
13,1061,"Sep 14 2009 	Great Location!	We have stayed here before, so we knew what to expect. Premier Inn is located in a great location - the tube stop is very close by (great access back to the airport as well on the Picadilly line). We generally stay at a cheaper hotel, but we had cause to be in London in August, and for sure wanted air conditioning, which Premier Inn does have. Nice and cool. Rooms are large and clean. The staff is always friendly, and if there is an issue, they doresolve quickly. For instance, when we checked into our double room, there was also acot in the room ..which we did not request and took up quite a lot of space. We called down and told them it needed to be removed, and she came upstairs fairly quickly to assess the situation (it had to be removed the next day as it was rather large)..but the point being she came up to help us out quickly.One problem with the hotel...they clearly don't have enough cleaning staff. Twice we came back to our hotel after 3:30 pm (once past 4:15) and our room still had not been cleaned. We like to come back, clean up and then head out to dinner and the theaterand not being able to get into the room at that late time was a problem for us. We hadseveral other long day trips, so for all I know, this happened several times more thanthe two times we knew of. The cleaning staff was very nice and did a good job, I am just saying it wasn't done by 3 pm (which it should be). I think most people in London like to clean up before dinner and many of the shows are at 7 pm, so one would expect to beable to be in one's room by 4 pm.Hotel is being re-furbished, but we had no problems with that. Again, the staff is quitehelpful and always smiling. Recommended especially for the summer months if onerequires air conditioning. Clean, comfy, centrally located."
14,1061,"Sep 6 2009 	Awful hotel and service	Travelled here for a weekend in London with a show. The hotel is set up vey strangely - on both sides of a road, which is crossed via a creaky 1st floor gangway. The hotel has 'Sshhh' signs all over the place, reflecting the thinness of the walls.The staff were okay, although fairly forgetful and disorganised. You need to walk through a quasi building site to get to the hotel (for the new restaurant).I would not recommend to anyone."
15,1061,"Sep 4 2009 	Quiet comfortable unpretentious and excellently located; reasonable value	After reading many TripAdvisor (TA) reports on a selection of hotels, boutique as well as chains, we chose Premier Inn as the best bet for a reasonably priced decent hotel. We were not disappointed. First, their web site is the most elegantly simple one we have come across. Not fussy, works which every browser we used (too many sites set up for IE and don't check if they work with others - we don't even bother proceeding further with those). We had booked Premier Inns for longer periods in 2 cities but then had to cancel; no problems. We later re-booked a shorter stay at this one.Much of their information is up front. The prices quoted include VAT etc; no having to search for fine print for add-ons. They warn of being adjacent to a rail line (in fact they seem to sit over one) but we had no problem with rail or road noise. They are undergoing renovations (could this be an older but post WWII hotel that has been taken over) and we were a bit concerned when we arrived but the only things we noticed were some obvious external work (with no noise) and the small temporary reception area. Our room was clean, compact but not compressed. For example, the double bed was in fact a queen bed (very comfortable), the small writing desk, with a mirror over it (and an adjacent hair dryer) doubled as a dressing table, and one could easily stretch out on the chesterfield. There was a simple electric jug and the makings for tea. The bathroom was simple but effective, especially the soap dispensers over the bath and hand basin (no walking off with the soap bars and those little sampler bottles you never use). And now to air conditioning.One of the things we were really looking for was air conditioning. In some of the TA reports brief mention is made of it in the reviews of some hotels but one or the weaknesses in Premier Inn is that it is difficult to get more information on specific hotels. After much reading we concluded that some of the hotels, including this one, did have AC but others not. Therefore, after getting to our room the first thing we checked was for AC. There were various sensors on the walls (some very old and obviously not connected) but we could not find anything which seemed to work and there was no obvious &quot;under the window&quot; big box. So we phoned the reception desk to complain that we did not have a working air conditioner. &quot;We'll have someone up there within 10 minutes, sir&quot;. They were there within 5. They have one of the craftiest and quietest systems we have come across. It turns out that there is no big box, just a vent in the ceiling; we had turned on the AC (and off again) but because we couldn't hear or see anything obvious assumed we did not have one. This leads to mention of the one important deficiency. There ought to be a folder in the room which explains how things work, including how to set the wake up call (instructions are on the 'phone but, being under the handpiece, you do not see them until you pick up to call the reception desk for a wake up call) and more detailed instructions (including a station/channel number list) on operation of the TV. Maybe people familiar with the English/EU system do not need that.Incidentally, on checking in they apologised for not having a restaurant ready but we do not think one is necessary. Within 5 minutes walk (at our octogenarian snail's pace - most could do it in 3 minutes) is Earls Court Road with a wide variety of ethnic eateries - Lebanese, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, French, representatives of various fast food chains, and even England is not forgotten with a Cornish Pasty shop essentially on the station (and their pasties are the best we have had in a long time) and an excellent pub (the Blackbird - named after the Lockheed SR-71 about which those we spoke to knew nothing). The area around Earls Court underground station is a good transportation hub. Four stops east is Victoria and easy access to the Gatwick Express; the Piccadilly Line takes you directly to Heathrow, and if the underground happens to be on strike (yes, it has happened to us - twice) it is a short cab ride to Victoria or to Paddington and the Heathrow Express. In the past couple of years we have stayed at two other London hotels, both chosen for their easy access to the Heathrow Express; a Best Western which simply had too much wrong with it at too high a price, and the Paddington Hilton which was excellent but came at a very high price, but probably reasonable value if you wanted all the bells and whistles. Our Premier Inn sat nicely in between - unpretentious, few bells and whistles but with all that one needed for a quiet and comfortable stay in London at a reasonable price (GBP98).Room for improvement without outlandish expense and consequent price increase? Yes. On the web site give a link from which we could get more information (one or two paragraphs) pertaining to specific hotels. Once in the hotel it would be nice to find an information folder in the room."
16,1061,"Sep 1 2009 	Good Value Good Location	We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel, just 1 block from Earls Court Tube Station. The rooms were roomy, clean and comfortable. The hotel was undergoing renovation during our visit, but we didn't hear any noise, or get inconvenienced by the works.With the renovations going on the hotel was not able to offer its full range of services, but given this it was clear and quiet, offering a good night guarantee. The staff guided us to another Premier Inn 5 minutes walk away for Breakfast. Earls Court Road also offers options for Breakfast.The rooms offer pay for use WiFi internet service at 5 GBP for an hour or 9 GBP for a day of basic use. (Business packages were also available.) The shared iron and ironing board between all rooms on the floor can be frustrating when demand is high and / or other guests neglect to return it.Overall this hotel was reasonable given it was undergoing renovations at the time. It is very close to Earls Court which makes it convenient and reasonable value for money. Once it has a bar and breakfast facilities again, it willbe a very good value hotel in London."
17,1061,"Aug 28 2009 	Best Hotel for Value and Cleanliness in London!	We stayed in this hotel of June 2008 after reading Trip Advisor reviews. Really close to Earlscourt tube station, shops, restaurants, etc. It was in a nice quiet area, the staff was really friendly and helpful. There was no free internet but an internet cafe about a block away. The room was not large, just enough room for 2 ppl and some suitcases but it was newly renovated and spotless. King bed which is impossible to find in London and A/C as well. Al in all fantastic stay would definitely stay again!"
18,1061,"Aug 18 2009 	Not exactly what we were expecting but it did the job!	We went to London for a 3 day, 2 night mini vacation. We really just needed a room with the bare minimum, since we weren't planning on spending a lot of time there, just to sleep for a few hours. Thats what we got. We needed a family room, but when we got there, it was just a double bed, a single bed and a lonely looking matress on the floor. The restaurant that was attached was being renovated, so no breakfast, but we were aware of that.Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly polish receptionist. She was very cheerful and helpful. She suggested another Premier Inn we could go to for breakfast, she recommended popular attractions that she thought had the best value and even gave us a special brouchure that we could get scanned at select locations for 20% off at select places.The breakfast at the over Inn was around 8 pounds, for a full English breakfast, and it was very good! There was sasauges, eggs, becon, croissants, tomatos, mushrooms, fresh fruit, cereal etc...When we checked out the receptionist wasn't as friendly, he barely said a word and didn't smile... at all, which I find odd.Our bathroom looked funny too, it was very bland looking and the white paint had big chips taken out of it.In the end, it did the job for sleeping, but wasn't exactly ''premier''."
19,1061,"Jul 31 2009 	Good Value and Location	We stayed here on a Sunday evening after having been to the Theatre. Parking is free around the area on Sundays so could park nearby until 8am the next morning. Really good value as the location is very good, and there are restaurants nearby (about 10 mins walk to various chain ones and shops). We had a double and a single bed for our daughter, lots of room to move about, quiet room and also clean. Would recommend this to others and is great for accessing London and all it's activities."
20,1061,"Jul 13 2009 	There are 2 Premier Inns at Kensington - make sure you tell the taxi the right address	Booked this hotel but was brought to Premier Inn Olympia. So, just decided to stay there. Turned out OK since Premier Inn Olympia was just newly renovated while Premier Inn Kensington is just being renovated (in the process). Both are walking distance from Earls Court Tube station."
21,1061,"Jul 3 2009 	Very good value for price	Despite the fact that this hotel was undergoing renovation when we visited I would not hesitate to recommend it based on several factors. Staff were accommodating and pleasant and fulfilled my request for a quiet room. Air conditioning unit was very quiet. Beds/pillows were very comfortable and linen seemed new. Hotel room itself was well organized for its space. Bathroom was clean but could use updating (ditto towels). Hotel in good location (nr restaurants, tube stops, shopping). We've stayed in more expensive hotels in London which have not been as nice, and in cheaper ones which have been rather grim."
22,1061,"Jul 1 2009 	Great you get what you pay for	My fiancee and I stayed here in June as a weekend away to celebrate her birthday and our anniversary. For 80 per night, it is possibly the best we would get in London. It is literally a 5 minute walk to Earls Court tube station. The only dowside was the restaurant and bar are currently closed for refurbishment. There was no monetion of this on the website or the booking confirmation, which was a bit annoying at 9pm on Friday night when we got there after a long journey. We didn't really want to go out as we had both had a long day etc, but there is a 24 hour sainsburys 5 minutes walk away. We would definitly stay there again, but we would go by train next time as the car park was about 60 for less than 48 hours and is actually attached to the Marriott hotel.For a city break in London, this place would be perfect. It was an excellent base to have a shower and sleep at night, which in a city like London is all you want."
23,1061,Jun 19 2009 	Nice room but under construction so no restaurent	The room was fine but there was no advice that the hotel was under construction and that there is no restaurent. This is still not disclosed on the web site!The room was mostly cleaned over three days. One day the coffee mugs had not been cleaned. The last day we ran out of soap in the bath/shower.Do not use their taxi recommendation unless you understand that they do not order a black cab. They use a local private cab that is twice as expensive as the balck cabs.
24,1061,"Jun 7 2009 	Will be great I am sure	I am a regular user of the Premier Inn chain so this hotel did come as a bit of a disappointment.It is very close to Earls Court tube which is on the Piccadilly line so we got to where we wanted to go very easily. As stated in other reviews the hotel is undergoing refurbishment which meant the bar and restaurant were closed-this is my problem, they should have told me this when booking. We ended up going to another Premier Inn for breakfast 7 minutes walk away, as luck would have it the weather was great so it was not a problem, if it had been raining it would have been a major pain.The room was fine spotlessly clean as always with Premier Inn and as usual the staff were great.The general appearance of the hotel is tired, hopefully the work going on will sort this out. When I go to London again I will stay somewhere else but still within the Premier Inn brand."
25,1061,"Jun 4 2009 	ok. prices vary by day. convenient area	We booked the Earls Court Premier Inn after receiving a less than desirable Priceline &quot;win&quot; on another hotel on a different day. We were hesitant to do so for additional nights, so booked this Premier due to the higher ratings, and flextible cancellation policy. It was fine, but In retrospect, I wish we would have used Priceline (or Hotwire) more. Cons: I think the current renovation does detract from the experience. The entry, halls, reception, etc. were not at all as attractive as they appear in photos. Our room was fine, although it had a lot of scrapes and scratches, making it look older and more worn. Bathroom handles were broken (although functional). None of these made much difference in our comfort; they only detracted from appearances. The lift was out during some of our stay as well. I think they may just shut it down periodically. We didn't order breakfast, but I was not impressed with the small &quot;boxed&quot; meals I saw outside other doors in the morning.Pros: Staff was friendly. Very comfortable bed. Clean. Convenient location, and away from the crowds (which we like). Please note, that the price may vary depending on when you book -- even for the same dates. We checked prices one day, decided to book the next, and they had gone up by 10%. Thinking we just missed a window of opportunity, we booked anyway. Then, several days later, the price was down again, so we cancelled the first, and booked a second time."
26,1061,"Jun 1 2009 	Room location matters renovation until end of 2009	I'm giving this two stars due to the renovation, perhaps it will be better once they are finished at the end of 2009. Everyone going in/out has to feed through one area in a narrow lobby, with just one small working elevator that broke during our stay. They are also doing noisy work on the road right outside.The area is full of hotels and restaurants, to help support the nearby convention center. Keep in mind the area will be heavy with tourists. You have a large selection to choose from on Earl's Court Rd. I think every fast food chain is represented, so you can eat for cheap if you choose. There are 3 large grocery stores within a 10 minute walk. The Earl's Court station is about a 5 minute walk away. It seems generally safe and quiet away from the main road.Quick travel tip if you stay here and arrive at Heathrow. I would recommend saving a ton of money and taking the Picadilly line, it's about 30 minutes to Earl's Court. There is an large elevator/lift that goes directly to the exit on Earl's Court Rd. You do not have to carry luggage up any stairs to exit the station.We had two different rooms, the first was across the walkway. These rooms were extremely small, pretty much just enough space to walk around a bed, we had a difficult time finding space for our two pieces of luggage. Small bathrooms with a leaky shower, we were thinking we made a big mistake. It would be a one star, mom and pop roadside motel in the USA. We managed to get another room, this time on the lobby side. This room was much better, typical average American motel room size. Small table, bigger bed and normal sized bathroom. All rooms have A/C.The lobby staff were always friendly and helpful, so that is a plus. You won't have anything to worry about in that regard.You will be taking a gamble with which room you get here, so keep that in mind. Hope you get there early enough to claim a good room. It can be anywhere from terrible to great. Since the renovation is not changing the rooms, this problem will not be fixed. With that much inconsistency, I would not return to this location."
27,1061,"May 20 2009 	Nice hotel reasonably priced.	My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights in May, 2009. The hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment but did not impact our stay at all. Our room was spacious, clean and modern and the bed very comfortable. The location is excellent, a 5 minute walk away from Earls Court Station.We would stay here again."
28,1061,"May 19 2009 	perfectly acceptable	We stayed for 2 nights to attend a concert.Had stayed 2 years ago and the only difference was that this time the retaurant and bar were closed for renovation.The restaurant being closed was not a problem as there are plenty of places to eat in Earls Court,however it would have been nice to be able to have a drink on returning from the concert.The staff are very friendly and helpful,room was clean,towels pristine and water hot.The hotel is in a quiet road only 2 minutes walk from the tube and there was no traffic noise.Looking in to the dingy hotels around this area,I would recommend this hotel for a &quot;no frills&quot; London trip.And will happily stay there again."
29,1061,"May 3 2009 	Good Value	Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days and was happy with the choice: the hotel is close to the subway (earls court or gloucester road), rooms are refurbished with good conveniences, spacious bathroom, big and very comfortable bed, and most of all, very quiet bedroom (he hotel is located &quot;behind&quot; the main street, cromwell road). This isn't the most touristic part of the city, but for the price was ok."
30,1061,"Apr 28 2009 	Great hotel but undergoing renovation	I've heard a lot of positive things about Premier Inns, and after this stay, I can understand why. Good room, reasonably soundproof, exquisitely clean, and friendly staff sum it up. So why not 5 stars? We showed up expecting breakfast with our room, and discovered that almost the whole ground floor was being renovated. No breakfast room, and only one elevator, which broke down the second day of our stay (Saturday) and was not fixed when we left Monday morning. In fairness, they did adjust our reserved with-breakfast price, and sent staff up to help us take 5 pieces of luggage down three flights of steps. I do wonder if they couldn't get elevator repair over the weekend, or were just unwilling to pay a weekend premium.We won't let the experience sour us on the hotel, which has a lot of positives, but if you plan to stay there before June, check and see that the renovations are finished."
31,1061,"Feb 21 2009 	Fulfilled its purpose as we passed thru London	Our family of four stayed there for two nights on arrival from the States. The room was tiny -- U.S. fire codes probably wouldn't allow occupancy by four people. The room was a bit worn and could have used a fresh coat of paint. The hotel was quite a lot more &quot;budget&quot; than we'd anticipated (or as it appears on the website). Our room was on the far side of the street, so coming and going always took a while, but that wasn't a deal-breaker. On the positive side, the location was good. Earl's Court Road was just a block away, with the tube station and a good selection of restaurants. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was ample for our needs. One other note: we smelled cigarette smoke each time we got off the elevator at our floor, which was odd because the entire property is non-smoking. On the second night, I was disturbed by a constant smell of cigarettes in both the room and bath, which seemed to come from the next room. I reported it as we checked out but never received an apology or other follow up from the staff.I'd recommend it to a friend only if they were looking for a central London location at a very low cost."
32,1061,"Jan 29 2009 	Great stay at Premier Inn London Kensington	This was a first time visit to London. I was on a European vacation with my daughter. The location was excellent, only a 2-3 minute walk from the Earl's Court Underground stop. The staff was fantastic. They bent over backwards to provide good service, especially in the restaurant. After long days of being on your feet sightseeing, we found this a very nice way to end the day by just having dinner there. The food was good, and the service excellent. We also found it to be very convenient to have the buffet breakfast there as well. We stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of our trip, then again for another 4 nights at the end of our trip before returning home. My daughter fell very ill the last few days, too sick to leave the hotel. The staff kept asking me how she was doing, and I even had one of the waitresses offer to go to the drug store for me. How sweet is that? She got free tickets to the London Eye for that kind gesture! We couldn't use them anyway, since my daughter was too ill to go. If we ever go back to London, we'd definitely stay there again. Our rooms were very clean and updated, the beds were very comfy, and very reasonably priced considering it was London. The staff was great!"
33,1061,"Jan 16 2009 	Great Hotel!	My partner and i stayed at this hotel in Nov 2008 for a long weekend. We were a bit worried as we had never stayed ourselves in London before so didnt knnow where was best! So glad we picked this hotel, Kensington is a lovely quiet area with loads of gorgeous houses surrounding the hotel. Earls Court is 2 mins walk around the corner next to loads of shops, bars, food places etc.. for getting home from the centre at night use the bus service... im not the smartest when it comes to these things but i found it so simple and easy to use and saves u a fortune in taxi fares!! TGI's in Picadilly Circus was lovely and the Circus is the place to be at the weekend.. it is heaving with people and loads of bars and clubs etc...Go to the comedy club in PC ... Didnt go this time but been before and its great!!"
34,1061,"Jan 13 2009 	A good choice but location not that convenient	The Hotel was one offered by British Airways as part of a package. I was very happy with the hotel itself. It was clean, moderately priced (relative to other hotels), and the staff was pretty friendly and it was indeed close to Earl's Court tube. We found that it was convenient to get on the subway from the hotel. What we found, however, was that as midnight approached, we found ourselves rushing to the train station to get back to the hotel so we didn't have to take an expensive cab or try to figure out the night bus system to get home. This placed restrictions on our &quot;nightlife,&quot; especially on the weekends when we wanted to stay in central London later. But, we were a little too concious of the cost of things (the dollar was 1/2 the value of the pound at the time) and certainly could have cabbed it back one night or two as an alternative. All in all, it was a quiet comfortable hotel with all of the modern conveniences in the room. We even managed to persuade British Airways to contact the hotel managemtn to allow uso keep our luggage in a storage room overnight when we went to Paris for one day/night. Premier Inn has a fairly strict policy of not allowing this. The exception they made allowed us to avoid hauling all of our luggage around London to get to Paris for a short stay."
35,1061,"Jan 11 2009 	Would definitely return	We moved to this Premier Inn from another terrible hotel so maybe my impression from Premier Inn is a bit impacted.The hotel is perfectly located, 3-minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station.Me and my friend got a family room (1 double bed and 1 single bed), we were told they didn't have any twin rooms.The room was spacious, there were a table with a chair, a wardrobe, a TV with many channels.The bathroom has a sink with 2 cranes (typical for UK), anyway we got used to it, and a bath. There is a douche gel and liquid soap in the bathroom only. The hotel is located in a quiet area although there seems to be a railway pretty near.During our 10-day stay we were never awaken by the noise outside of the room or inside, although I always face this problem in other hotels.The room had an air-conditioning system which allowed to set the comfortable temperature in the room.The designs of the room seem to be modern. The rooms were cleaned every day and we got new towels daily although we didn't ask for them.The staff was extremely polite and helpful whenever we made any enquiries or asked for help.There are plenty of places to eat near the Earl's court tube station (indian, chinese, thai, italian, pubs etc.).The only problems during our stay were:1. we couldn't decide who'll sleep on the big bed2. the towels had quite a strange smell (I assume that was the detergent)3. the staff that cleaned our room accidentally took our own glasses and they could not find them to give them back to us, although they tried really hard to locate the glassesOverall, I find this place very good and comfortable, it's not the same as a 5-star hotel, but it's a good value for money in London."
36,1061,"Jan 10 2009 	Good but not great	I stayed at the hotel over new years break, location is great (in a nice area, lots of restaurants and very close to the tube) but the hotel disappoints when it comes to details:- shower pressure is too weak, it was a struggle to shower everyday- ameneties are basic which is understandable but things like the complimentary kettle in teh room was too old and grubby to use. - the restaurant prices are very high compared to what you get and not so well organized.otherwise the hotel is fine in terms of room size, cleanliness, friendliness of staff.thx,"
37,1061,"Jan 7 2009	No - too much noise from tube lines	I stayed here for a few nights but was unlucky with the room I was allocated. The noise from the tube line below was easily audible, even with earplugs in, the window firmly shut and curtain drawn. I travel and work away from home quite a lot, so am used to new surroundings and city noise, but the soundproofing was exceptionally poor. I had such a packed itinerary I just didn't have time to hang around and change room.In fairness, when I raised the issue, I received a one night refund, but I was of the impression they were well aware of the problem but there was no indication that anything awould be done about it. One good thing was the cleanliness - the room was spotless, really 5 star clean. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it."
38,1061,"Jan 1 2009 	Just OK	After reading some of the reviews on here, I was looking forward to our stay at the Premier Inn in Earl's Court, Kensington. I have to admit to being slightly disappointed, though.Firstly, location-wise, the hotel cannot be beaten. It is situated in a nice area of Earl's Court (with some great architecture - worth a stroll), and is only two minutes walk away from the tube station. No problem there. Check-in was also fine. The room was typical Premier Inn - no real frills, but pretty much unbeatable for the price. My issues with it started to niggle more and more, though. Secondly, the heating was adjustable, but it never seemed to work properly. So, if you increased it a little, it seemed to increase considerably and vice versa. It was always too hot or too cold! Perhaps it was just our room, but it was frustrating. Another main problem was the shower. I've stayed in the Premier Inn on Albert Dock in Liverpool, and the showers there were incredibly strong. Here, the flow was weak, the temperature was unpredictable and the shower head seemed broken. A little shoddy. My final issue was with the restaurant. We decided to eat dinner at the hotel's restaurant one night, and despite the hefty prices (perhaps understandable for London), we were looking forward to it. We were asked to wait to be seated - despite the fact the restaurant was more than half empty. When we were, the overly enthusiastic waiter rattled through all manner of menu options, so much so that it was hard to keep up. We both ordered the pizza anyway. We waited. And waited. And waited. It took the kitchen close to 45 minutes to prepare two pizzas in a half-empty restaurant. During this time, a man who looked like the chef, spent a number of minutes just wandering the restaurant. With regard to the prices we were paying, the service was very, very poor and will hopefully be improved for the future. I hardly dare imagine what the wait would be if the restaurant was full.So, overall, the accommodation was ok. The price is still very competitive for the area, but there were still some niggles there which will hopefully be ironed out for the future."
39,1061,"Nov 25 2008	Friendly Comfortable and Convenient	Premier Inn Kensington Date of stay 10th November 2008Arrived 7pm, greeted by efficient and friendly reception staff.The room was of a reasonable size for London with flat sceen tv, coffee maker etc. Very clean and with a comfortable bed.We decided to have breakfast in the hotel which was 7.95 per person, buffet style, eat as much as you like. We had seen pubs on earls court rd offering breakfast at 5.00 but we preferred to be here. So glad we did! The staff could not be friendlier and the selection of food was excellent. Also breakfast tables are at a discreet distance from eact other enabling you to have a private conversation.We both noted how even the cleaning staff took the trouble to greet every guest as they passed by.The location is three minutes walk from earls court tube and many restaurants and pubs are nearby.For the price we consider this a real find and we will defintely stay again on ouir next visit."
40,1061,"Nov 17 2008 	great hotel	Very nice and comfortable hotel. I liked the location - slightly out of the tourist area. Good place to go back to in the evening, lots of places to grab a bit to eat. The people in the bar were very friendly - gave us glasses and ice!. Close to the Tube. Nice sized room comfy beds, clean and modern."
41,1061,"Nov 11 2008 	Very comfortable stay	I have just returned from a 4 day stay at Premier Inn Kensington.It was very hard to decide what London hotel to stay , but tripadvisor helped me a lot. So hard to find right balance between price, location and quality hotel.Neigbourhood is really ok, safe at night. Earl court undergroung 2-3 minutes walking. Couple of nice restaurants, and some nice place just opposite tube entrance where you could have breakfast ( maybe hotel price at 8 pounds is little to much ).Sainsbury and Tesco stores are also close by.I was alone in room, so i had enough space, but my parents were in other room and they also had enough space.Room is clean, shower is ok, also heating was working, and i heard no noise from outside (maybe because we have been so tired after sightseeing and shoping).Window can not be fully open because of security reasons.We have been on second floor acroos the street via tunnel, but everything is well explained so we had no problems finding our rooms.Staff at check in are ok , and we used luggage storage both on arrival and departure.Bar has Sky sports ( although 3.30 for a pint of Guiness is too much) , and in room you have enough TV programmes.Definitely if you dont need any extras, this is hotel for you.I will come again."
42,1061,"Nov 5 2008 	Would highly recommend!	Extremely friendly staff, only two minutes from the tube and spotlessly clean rooms, what more could you ask for? We didn't eat in the restaurant or use the bar but they were always busy when we past them. Would recommend Balans on Old Brompton Rd for breakfast. I would definitely stay here next time I am in London for it's location and price."
43,1061,"Nov 4 2008 	Great location great price	If you are looking for a cheap and reliable base for seeing the sights of London then you can't go far wrong here. Located in a very pleasant, safe and accessible location, close to Earls Court tube, the Premier Inn is the perfect choice. Small, but spotlessly clean rooms with great showers and freeview on the modern TV's. Breakfast is actually a bargain if travelling with children as they eat free with every adult. Good choice of restaurants on the main road by the tube. What makes this place special however are the charming and helpful staff. Whoever is managing this place deserves credit for his team who are consistently friendly, attentive and despite the crowds at half term, willing to take time with each guest. This is a budget hotel, but some of the bigger names could take a few lessons from the team here!"
44,1061,"Nov 1 2008 	Clean with Easy Tube Access	As long as you are not looking for extravagance, this spot is perfect. Our room was small (we had two adults and two children), but since we only used it to sleep and shower, we didn't need a lot of room. Best of all, the Earl's Court Tube stop was only about a block away, as were a few restaurants and pubs. This inn was a clean and affordable place to stay in London. We would certainly stay there again."
45,1061,"Oct 22 2008 	Excellent stay.	My husband &amp; I stayed here for 4 nights in October 2008. We arrived at the hotel quite early in the day, but were allocated a room straightaway. We found all the staff to be extremely helpful, pleasant &amp; polite. The variety &amp; choice of food, both hot &amp; cold, at breakfast was of a very high standard. The room was very clean &amp; the bed was very comfy. The location of the hotel itself was excellent, only 2 minutes walk from Earl's Court tube station. As it is in a residential area, there was virtually no outside noise. There were several good bars &amp; cafes in the vicinity and an excellent Italian restaurant about 8 minutes walk away. Altogether it was an excellent stay &amp; I would not hestitate to recommend this hotel to friends &amp; family &amp; would stay here again in the future."
46,1061,"Oct 17 2008 	Quiet convenient great value	This is my second Premier Inn. I stayed at Gatwick last year. I must say that the Gatwick one is a little nicer in terms of design but honestly it's a great value. I stayed out in this way b/c I didn't want to be in the center of London as it's very loud at night. Kensington is just up the street from the tube and there's food, internet and everything on the same street as the station. The check in was nice and friendly as always and the room was clean just a slightly below the comforts of the Gatwick one. But overall great hotel chain. So happy I found this chain and I'm staying loyal."
47,1061,Oct 15 2008 	Good location	We stayed in a couple of Premier Inns and found them to be clean and comfortable &amp; quiet. The only problem we found was that our teenage children didn't like thier bedding. One had the couch and the other a mattress on the floor. The mattress on the floor was particularly uncomfortable - you could feel the springs. Probably wouldn't be a problem with younger children. The location was great - very handy to the train.
48,1061,"Oct 8 2008	Cosy 	My family &amp; I have been travelling in Europe for 5 weeks, and this is by far one of the best we have stayed. It is located just 2 mins walk from Earls Court tube station. Which is a great station to be near cos this particular station connects to quite a number of lines, without you have to travel to other stations to change. Its not very near a lot of places of interest but its convenient. Also, its located on a quiet street in a nice residential area, away from the noise of main streets or train stations. But walk 2 mins, and you'll reach grocery shops, restaurants, cafes which are sprinkled near the tube station. There's even Marks &amp; Spencer.The room was not big, but there was enough space, even after accomodating a 2nd bed in the room, cos we have a child with us.(which i do not believe the hotel charged us extra for). The room looks new, is clean, has aircon as well as a heater. It provided complimentary coffee/tea making facilities which in my books is always a must. The beds were extremely comfortable. There were plenty of channel options on TV if you ever eat in. The breakfast although not bundled in the 90 pounds per nite we paid, was a good deal. 7.95 pounds for full breakfast or 5.95 for just continental. The quality of food served at breakfast was good, and there was good choice. Our child who's ate free. There was porridge which you can order as part of the meal, which is great for him. this is definitely cheaper than eating out. So we had breakfast at the hotel most days.Service staff was good, helpful &amp; friendly. Only 2 things I didn't like 1) the 2 separate taps for cold &amp; hot water at the wash basin. How do people manage? 2) Internet is payableAlso, even though we were in the room across the street (connected by a covered walkway bridge) you can hear the muffled sounds of the trains. But its not loud enough to bother us really. Premier Inn is my choice."
49,1061,"Oct 7 2008 	From ok to nice	Having red a thousand reviews about hotels in London I decided to choose this one, price was ok, good location and people said it was not a bad place. Ok dokey thats it. Good location, ok price and place not bad at all. If I were you I would not take breakfast since you have like 4 or 5 places to take a good breakfast at Earls Court or, if on a tight budget, you can go to Cronwell Road Sainsburys and get your 4 day breakfast for two for 15 pounds. The carpet is a bit old and, depending where you are, the way to go to your room seems like a labyrinth but once the receptionist-guide tells you the way you just need a bit of hotel jungle expertise and you will land in your room. Once you are there a fridge would be nice too but all in all I would repeat the place if I do not want to go to the 150s. If you consider those regions a land for corporate travel and rich people go to the Premier Inn, clean, convenient and with nice rooms."
50,1061,"Sep 30 2008	Great value good location quiet	This hotel is the best value I've ever paid for a one-night stay in London, that's for sure.A good location - not truly central, but handy for being in Kensington (and not far from the centre if that's what's needed).Large room, spotlessly clean, comfortable bed. Also, terrifically clean bathroom, with decent size and facilities. Friendly staff. And perhaps the greatest feature - peacefully quiet. Unlike the many chain hotels (at 2-3 times the price) that are nearby, the Premier Inn is one street back from the main Cromwell Road, and so gets no traffic noise at all.One slightly weird thing is that there are loads of card locks everywhere - to go into the annex (where I was staying), I had to go through no fewer than four door locks.All in all, a really excellent hotel in London. Pretty much impossible to fault, for the price."
51,1061,"Sep 19 2008 	Excellent Service and Value for Money	I spent seven nights at the Premiere Inn Kensington between July 1 and July 8, 2008.I was impressed with their service from the get-go. I originally booked my reservation with Travlocity.ca in April 2008 at an early-bird rate of $99.00 per night. The regular room rate was $134.00 per night. When I arrived at the hotel I was surprised to learn that they had no record of my booking. Apparently Travelocity neglected to fax the hotel and complete the booking. I had a printed copy of my Travelocity confirmation, which I presented to the hotel manager. Luckily they had rooms available, and with no fuss, no muss, the manager booked me in for six nights at the early booking rate of $99.00.The hotel is a stones throw form Earls Court tube station, and close to all the action on Earls Court and Cromwell Road. The room was large and spacious, with a comfortable queen sized bed. Small hi-def flat screen TV was a real treat for morning / late night news. Excellent bathroom facilities with piping hot water (you will note the Caution: Hot Water signs at the tub and sink; they arent kidding, the water is scalding hot!)No hairdryers in the bathroom as I recall, so bring your own if you need one.Excellent buffet breakfast for $7.99, in a modern dining area with good quality food. Lots of families with kids, so maybe not your first pick if you are a young single or young couple looking for something more hip. My only real qualm was with the very small bar / lounge area, tucked away next to the dining area. The service was a bit spotty at the bar; the bar is only staffed consistently at peak hours; otherwise youll only get service if the one of the staff members notices you standing at the bar, waiting for a drink. Also, the lounge area is small, with seating for about 20 people max. Not a big deal since there are plenty of other bars and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.Great hotel; I highly recommend it and will stay here again on my next trip to London."
52,1061,"Sep 17 2008 	Good base in a great location	Stayed here for 2 nights, 10 - 12th Sept, while at a conference. Room was in a building across from the main hotel reached by a walkway on the 2nd floor. it was a clean and modern room with air con and a flat screen tv. Tea and coffee supplied but only soap in the bathrooms. Adequate warddrobe space but not drawers. No problems with noise but room outlook was over roof tops. All in all considering its position, minutes walk from Earls Court tube station, a good value hotel. Would use it again."
53,1061,"Sep 17 2008 	Just What We Wanted	Stayed here for 4 days at the end of July after reading the reviews here on TripAdvisor. The location is great for anyone who's looking to spend most of their time out seeing the sights. Earl's Court station (1 block away) and surrounding business have all the essentials you need (market, pubs, casual dining) right there. The morning breakfast on site provided a good start for the day's adventures. Rooms were fine (clean, quiet) but if you're looking for more than basic accommodations then perhaps this isn't for you. There's a fee for internet access."
54,1061,"Sep 16 2008 	highly recommended	I've traveled to London several times and for the most part getting a good hotel in the city (if you're on a tight budget) is a gamble. But I can genuinely recommend this hotel. The staff were all very pleasant and approachable, the room was clean, quite large for a London hotel room, modern, and the price was competitive. And I'm pleased to say the bed was large and comfortable.I also stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall, and can also recommend that location."
55,1061,"Sep 1 2008 	Good location and price	Hotel is in a great location, basic but good for the price.Clean and friendly.Stayed for 2 nights in family room children ages 3 &amp; 5."
56,1061,Aug 29 2008 	great hotel	Stayed for one night on 24thAug08 to see George Michael in concert we thought the hotel was brilliant .The location was just right the room was very clean and comfortable and the staff were very polite and helpful.The food in the restaurant was also very nice.We had a great time.
57,1061,"Aug 16 2008 	Will definitely return-couldn't do better for the price!	This is an excellent hotel to stay in when visiting London. My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights and have no complaints. The room was exceptionally clean, spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast is very good value, you can have as much as you like and fill up on tea and very good coffee, I would strongly advise to take up the offer of one paying adult with free breakfast for child up to 16 years. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are cleaned every day and if you need clean towels there is no problem they will be changed as often as you wish. There is a luggage room available if you need it and a safe deposit option for your valuables at no extra cost. Earls Court itself is very self contained with plenty of restaurants and shops just a short street away. All and all it was a very pleasant stay and I will definitely use Premier Inn Hotels again."
58,1061,"Aug 13 2008 	Basic Lodging	Good basic hotel: clean, fresh surfaces (appears freshly painted), with good air conditioning in rooms.Two buildings facing each other on the street with the family friendly side facing reception.We were in the family side but it was as quiet as a church. Getting there is a bit of a maze involving numerous passages, elevators and doors.Good location: near Earls Court tube, lots of businesses in areaSome faux pas: original room assigned appeared occupied; second room key turned off meaning negotiating the maze when back to reception when we exhausted; requested a taxi for departing and got a very expensive limo service to the train station."
59,1061,Aug 12 2008 	Excellent Location	We booked this directly through British Air as part of a special they were running at the time that included credits toward a hotel stay. We were thoroughly satisfied. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Earl's Court tube station and also very convenient to some of the bus lines that run from the High Street Kensington tube station (a bit further walk). There are lots of eating options close by as well as some supermarkets. The hotel itself was very clean and our room was quiet. We stayed in the part of the hotel that is across the street from the lobby. This hotel has air conditioning. We arrived at the hotel around noon expecting to just be able to drop our bags for a while but they let us check in at that time. We had a triple room and there were no surprises - we were very satisfied.
60,1061,"Aug 5 2008 	Great Location Good Value	This was part of a package through British Air and was very inexpensive. If you can't afford to stay right in the very heart of Leicester Square or Picadilly Circus, this is a great place to stay. It is 1 long block from Earl's Court Tube Station which has the Picadilly Line and the Circle/District Lines, which means you can get just about anywhere very quickly. It is convenient to Heathrow on the Picadilly Line. It is also walking distance to Kensington Garden, Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A - not to mention Harrods!! The room and bathroom was were very average, but clean and comfortable. When I'm in London, I am not in the room much, so I really wasn't looking for any amenities (there are none). Breakfast was good if a bit expensive, but because kids eat free, my daughter and I started each day with a good breakfast at a reasonable cost. Note that because there are so many tourist hotels nearby, the subway station ticket lines can be long in the morning. Plan ahead and purchase tickets the night before or get the multi-day passes.In the past I've stayed at the Premier Inn - County Court House (just next to the London Eye). I would recommend that place first - if you can get a room there. Otherwise, this is a convenient, clean hotel, right on the subway."
61,1061,Aug 4 2008 	Fantastic Location	This hotel is a short walk from the Earl's Court tube station. We were able to take the train easily from and back to Heathrow. Trips into the center of London were also easily accessible. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We had to book two rooms because they only told us about the ability to put a cot in a four person room after it was too late. But it probably made for more comfortable accomodations since we weren't crowded. They had a full english breakfast each morning. Kids ate free. It was quite good and filling allowed us to snack during the day and eat only another dinner. Very accomodating in that we were allowed to keep our luggage on site before checkin and after check out. It allowed us to see the sites and not have to lug everything around. Staff was very nice and helpful. All other places we looked at were nearly twice the price. So you can't beat the value.
62,1061,Aug 2 2008 	Ideal Location	Ideal base as only a short walk from Earls Court tube station allowing quick access to central London and all the usual must see places. Hotel was very clean. Staff were great and very pleasant. Service in resturant was good and food was very good value for money. The room we stayed in had air conditioning which was very welcome. Rooms were cleaned each day and towels replaced. Will certainly use again. The hotel will also store luggage for you after check out but you need to get your bags down early as it is on a first come first served basis due to the space available.
63,1061,"Jul 27 2008	Good Value	Stayed here a few times now and has become first choice for trips to London. Having said that the prices have gone up fairly significantly over the past couple of years but if you can get a room for around 80 quid it is still pretty good for this part of London.We booked our room some months in advance and I checked availability the night before we were due to stay and the same room was 40 cheaper ! So I cancelled original booking and made the cheaper one.It has all been said before really, usual Premier Inn rooms and facilities, handy for the Underground with good links and handy if you fancy a walk too. Reasonably quiet location with not much street noise. Last time we stayed we had a room on the first floor which overlooked a roof with some machinery on, possibly air conditioning units, and these were fairly noisy and might bother some people so check it out. The hotel is split in two with one half across the road from reception and I reckon this is the quietest part.Plenty of places to eat nearby by for evening meals and for good breakfasts and a couple of decent boozers.One thing though, if were being honest, It isn't really Kensington is it ?"
64,1061,"Jul 25 2008	Despite problems still a good deal	This is our second time staying at the Premier Inn Kensington. (We found it through the British Airways website.) The location and price are what drew us back. The Earl's Court Tube station is linked via the Picadilly Line to Heathrow! What convenience! (And there are no steps to negotiate--on the Tube map, look for the disabled logo to identify handicap-friendly stations.) The other nearby Tube station, Gloucester Road, is surrounded by somewhat more upscale stores than those near Earl's Court.Though the hotel is decidedly budget in ambience, the neighborhood (Kensington) is one of the most expensive in London, so you will enjoy your surroundings.The Museum of Natural History and Victoria and Albert are within walking distance.Be aware that part of Premier Inn is located across the street, linked to the main hotel by an enclosed bridge. It's a hassle to lug your bags down long hallways and change elevators twice. The annex side is quiet. In the main section, some rooms directly overlook the tracks. But sound insulation is good enough it shouldn't bother you.Quarters are very cramped, but all the facilities are there. Internet access via the phone line is expensive. There's a much cheaper internet cafe down the street (as you walk toward the Earl's Court Tube station).The staff struck me as overworked and underpaid. They tended to be grumpy and unhelpful. But for the price and location I'm willing to put up with a bit of bad service--it's really not their fault."
65,1061,"Jul 24 2008	Great Location in Kensington From Which To Explore London	We stayed here 2 nights (June 29-30) with an EF Tours group. Like the other reviewers found, the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood a little over a block from the Earls Court Tube station, which makes it convenient to most of London. There is a nice little bar in which to have a drink after a long day of traipsing around London. Kensington also provides a nice area in which to get out and stroll -- Harrod's is not very far away. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the breakfast our group had was very good. If I were to return as an individual tourist, I'd certainly consider making this a base from which to visit London."
66,1061,"Jul 22 2008 	Basic clean and quiet accommodation close to a few pubs and the Earls Court Tube	We went RUNNING from the nearby Derby Hotel and spent two nights here during our post cruise tour of London. In fact we actually slept three times here since the good people at the front desk let us check in at 6am as we fled our dreadful room at the Derby a block away. Thank god as we hadn't had a wink of sleep at that hotel so were thankful to snooze a few hours at the Premier Inn before beginning our touring late that morning.The hotel is clean and basic, There is no room safe or refrigerator but the place was quiet and the bed very very comfortable.It's a nice area, with some shops and pubs, a Subway sandwhich joint, and a few fast food restaurants all within a block from the Earls Court Subway station. Very convienient for touring around London.One thing about this location, there are two areas that you may be housed, in our case it was accross the street from the lobby accessable via a Street sky walk. A bit confusing, but after a few wrong turns we got good at finding our room and our way in and around the hotel. Our room was nice and quiet, we slept very well.Oh ya, we paid  84.00 per night, not cheap, but by London standards for a clean comfy room a relitive bargain.I'd recommend the Premier Inn Kensington, and there excellent and professional staff."
67,1061,"Jul 2 2008 	Great for wimbledon	Stayed here for 2 nights last week - booked at short notice as were unable to stay with friends near Wimbledon as planned. Most decent looking hotels in this price bracket in West London were booked up. We were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Room, breakfast and service all excellent for the price. Location great for tube out to Wimbledon tennis"
68,1061,"Jun 29 2008 	Good value Great location!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights whilst going to see a day's play at the Queen's tournament. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and despite a little trouble finding the hotel (due to forgetting to print directions) arrived with not too much trouble.This hotel is one street away from the Earls Court tube station so easy access to central london. It was about a 20 minute walk to Queens Club which was ok as it was a lovely day. We had an evening meal in the hotel which was good and not too expensive considering. Didn't eat breakfast but prices seemed reasonable - be aware there are several options in the hotel as opposed to the 1 offered when booking online!The room was a good size, clean and tidy complete with flat screen tv.A final positive was the requirement to have a room key to access the lifts - a nice touch of added security!"
69,1061,"Jun 24 2008 	Fantastic Hotel!	We decided to stay at this hotel after seeing great reviews on tripadvisor. We wanted decent accommodation that was good value. We booked &amp; paid for a 3 night stay on the Premier Inn webpage  we also opted for the full all you can eat breakfast which was an extra cost but seemed worth it. Paying for the room online was great because it meant we didnt need to pay for anything when we arrived/left the hotel  the bill had been all taken care of months before we got there!When we got to the hotel  we LOVED it! The rooms were very clean and spacious. The bed was AMAZING  Premier Inn even have a good night sleep guarantee! I can see why  I didnt even want to leave the bed to sightsee! Bathrooms are a good size, they even have a bath in there for a relaxing soak after a long day. Tea &amp; Coffee are restocked when the rooms are made up and kettles are cleaned regularly. The breakfast  WOW  I would recommend to book the full breakfast as part of your stay  Service was fantastic in the restaurant, with staff always checking that the food was fine etc. And the food  the BEST breakfast Ive ever eaten! We were in an abundance of cereals, eggs, Heinz baked beans, meats, bread, yoghurt, fruit juices, museli, and even porridge (made to order) plus so much more! We also ate at the same restaurant for dinner a few nights  which was also an exceptional experience. The hotel is within walking distance to Earls Court tube station which we found very handy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning to stay in London  it was reasonably priced, food tasty, staff friendly and helpful and in perfect position. And I must say, we really did have the best night sleep weve ever had at that hotel  if only we could take the beds home! I cant wait to stay there again!"
70,1061,"Jun 20 2008 	Simple Clean Good Value. In One Word - Excellent.	I stayed here in October 2007 with my mother and sister for 4 nights. We booked directly through the Chain's reservation lines and got an excellent price of 80 Pounds a night for a family room. The hotel entrance has a 24hr manned reception with a few chairs and no lobby (made no difference to us). There is a small pub which we did not visit. Breakfast is not included in the price but 2 children eat free with a paying adult. They define children to be anyone under 16 so my sister was able to eat free. The breakfast was good quality and varied and you can choose between continental and full. Breakfast room was pleasant and staff were very friendly during all of our visits. The room we got was situated on the opposite side of the street (the hotel is divided into two buildings on both sides of the road). To get to that part of the hotel you have to cross an over-road walkway. It is impossible to exit or enter the hotel directly from the second building as the doors were locked so it is necessary to use the walkway. This makes your way into and out of the building longer but It does provide a sense of security (as the main entrance is always manned). We didn't mind the bit of walking but the walkway itself was very poorly insulated. Some of the nights during October were quite cold and it was not pleasant to walk through there without a coat on. This was perhaps the only (minor) issue we had during our stay. I read complaints about the train noise in other reviews but we experienced no such problem, you might want to ask for a room on this side.The room itself was very satisfactory. It was roomy and we had one double bed and an additional sofa/single bed. There was an optional third mattress on the floor which we did not use. Beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. I even liked the purple theme of the &quot;Premier Inn&quot; design. Our window faced directly into the other side of the hotel which meant we had to keep the curtain closed most of the time to avoid staring into other people's rooms. Bathrooms were functional and in good shape. The entire room ,including bathroom, was very clean and well taken care of. Housekeeping did a very good (daily) job as well. If you have children or otherwise need to use the TV, note that there is a very small selection of channels.Location was even better than we had anticipated. It is a very short walk to the underground and we felt safe walking in the area after dark.For a very low price (in London terms) we got a well located, very clean and even pleasant room. Definitely a good find which I would highly recommend to anyone."
71,1061,"Jun 19 2008 	An Excellent Stay	I stayed at the hotel from 16th to 18th June 2008. The hotel was very easy to find, a 5 minute walk, if that from the tube station.The Hotel:Check in was a breeze, we arrived before 2pm (the check in time) and they had a room all ready for us so we did not have to wait around. Our room was on the 5th floor, in the main block and I have to say, I wondered where all the bad reviews on this site came from. The room was newly refurbished - or it seemed it - with a huge bed, flat screen tv, seating area, dressing table and a kettle etc. The bathroom was bigger than mine at home, and was all new with a white suite and the shower was great, high enough for me which is a bonus as i am 6ft tall and in most hotel rooms the shower head only comes to my shoulders, which makes it hard to wash my hair!! I could not find one thing wrong with our room. There was no fridge but vending machines in reception and I asked at the bar for a bucket of ice, which i got. The room was air conditioned too.We slept well and were not disturbed by trains or the road, like some people have complained about on this site. At the end of our trip, we checked out at 12 and the hotel has a luggage room so we could still enjoy the sites without carting our stuff around before our train. They can keep your luggage there untill 8pm.The Bar and Restaurant:We did not eat at the restaurant, but we glanced at the menu and the prices did not seem too bad at all. Drinks at the bar were what you would expect for London. Overall:The hotel is a fantastic hotel, clean and modern, with friendly staff in a great location. At 95 per night, I have not got anything to complain about at all! I definatley would stay here again!!!"
72,1061,"Jun 10 2008 	great for families	This hotel is great for families. If you are looking for European charm like in storybooks, don't stay here. But if you are looking for a good location which includes a clean, comfortable, spacious room with your family ( 4 people) look no further. We stayed here with our 2 children ( 8 and 9) and were delighted. The full English breakfast ( free for kids) was great... got us going for most of the day. The service in all respects was great,. The room was clean, with a large bathroom and very comfortable beds- was perfect after a whole day of sightseeing . The area was safe, with many, not too expensive restaurants. Even the hotel meal at night was good and inexpensive even though the service was a little slow, we were pleased. Ok yes, we had to walk a little ways inside the hotel to get to our room , but really this was not a problem. Yes, you hear trains at times during the night, but the subway closes during most of the night - so really not a problem ( I am a very very light sleeper and had no problem)- overall this was a fantastic place , especially for families with kids and we highly recommend it. Just one word of caution, not about the hotel but rather Earl's court subway- rush hour is crazy and it is hard to get into a train. Go before or after and it is not a problem - the station itself is great for the piccadilly line as well as the circle and district line - also direct from heathrow - could you ask for anything more???"
73,1061,"Jun 2 2008 	Great location	My husband and I stayed here for four nights at the end of a three-week vacation. I had stayed at Premier Inns before, so was familiar with their accommoations. I picked this particular hotel because it was very close to one of my favorite restaurants.The location didn't disappoint. It was only a block from Earls Court Road and the tube station for the Piccadilly line, so it was extremely easy to get to the major attractions. Unfortunately we were there during a holiday weekend when many of the central London lines were completely or partially out of service, so we experienced a few delays and detours, but overall the tube access was terrific. Earls Court also has a lot of great restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, pubs, Internet cafes, and other shops right there. We ate dinner and sometimes lunch in the area every day. It was nice not to be in the crowded central London area; it felt like a relief to come back to peace and quiet after a long day.The room was spacious and comfortable, although it could use a little facelift in the furnishings (for example, the Kings Cross location had nice dark blue tiles in the bathroom, whereas this one had faded ivory tiles with some dark grout spots and strange wooden siding on the tub). It was reasonable for a budget hotel, considering we paid less than 100 GBP per night. Internet access was ridiculous at 12 GBP per day. There was hallway noise from housekeeping in the morning and doors shutting at all hours, but generally it didn't bother us too much.We didn't eat in the restaurant as there were so many great choices nearby. We had hoped for some kind of laundry facility, but unfortunately there was none onsite.Generally I would give the hotel decent marks but don't expect anything spectacular. The location was the best thing about it and for that reason I would stay there again."
74,1061,"May 27 2008 	Highly recommended	Just got back from a couple of nights at the PI Kensington and would thoroughly recommend it to visitors wanting a safe, convenient hotel, a comfortable room at a decent price and helpful staff. Our room was spacious, very clean and comfortable, and quiet despite the fact that the hotel is so close to Earl's Court tube station. Bathroom facilities are good, though toiletries are basic, as seems to be the norm these days (foam soap at the basin and combined Lux shampoo/shower gel at the bath). Only half a dozen coathangers, so you might need more for a longer stay. Museums a pleasant 20 minute walk away, (don't whatever you do miss the stunning Victoria and Albert!), around 35 minutes through a good area to the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park, and plenty of eating places in the neighbourhood, as well as a Sainsburys and a Waitrose should you need them. The breakfast was all-encompassing and the trays kept well-stocked. It's a treat to have breakfast served until 11 on Sundays, and also a reasonable check-out time of 12 noon. And I can't praise the young staff enough - they really are very friendly and helpful. I can't imagine where the recent &quot;puce plastic&quot; review sprang from - the only bit of puce we saw was on the faces of the poor old Leeds United fans who'd lost their crucial Wembley play-off!"
75,1061,"May 13 2008 	Budget priced but has everything that matters	Despite the overuse of purple in the decor, what a great hotel. Comfortable beds, huge room for London, big bathroom, and very, very clean. Best of all, you actually have your own table and chairs, tea, and coffee. Who ever heard of that in a European budget hotel? The weather was awful the week we were in London and we spent more time than expected in our room, and it was a very pleasant place to be.The hotel restaurant proved to be extremely popular, but we weren't very interested. There are many excellent restaurants near the Earl's Court station that is only 1-2 blocks away. And a large supermarket about 3 blocks away as well.The hotel lobby was always full of people, including tourist groups and large families, but the rooms and hallways were very quiet. This hotel has function, comfort, cleanliness and is actually very quiet. A great bargain compared to typical London prices."
76,1061,"May 9 2008 	Suitable for families	We stayed in the hotel for three nights, with my family (I've two children of 9 and 12 years).Position is great. Only 3 minutes from Earl's Court Underground (zone 1).Full Breakfast (free for children) is great too, even if it is not clear that it is not possible to have full selection from Costa Coffee menu, and my son enjoyed it very much (he eats a lot).Room is clean, also bathroom is clean, and there is dispenser for Shampoo and Soap.Room is very spacious for 2 adults and 1 child, as the 2'nd bed for children leaves few space, however for a short stay is perfect.All the staff is very gentle.The restaurant menu is simple, and they have a kids menu, so we had lunch in the hotel all three evenings.Any bad things ?Water bottle distributor was broken."
77,1061,"May 3 2008 	Premier Inn - clean comfortable inexpensive but lacks charm	Most previous reviews have got it right about this hotel. I searched a lot for an inexpensive hotel in London (inexpensive? All things are relative!) and found this one from the glowing reviews. This hotel is large and modern. Everything looked new and clean, though cheap in construction and distinctly charmless. The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet, but there were few amenities such as are usually found. I saw shower gel/shampoo and a hairdryer but no bars of soap, lotion, shower caps or other usual toiletries although there was a hot water pot and tea. Few channels were available on the TV. Internet was available on WiFi, though it was fairly costly. My husband, being a native Londoner, was in hog heaven at breakfast. The full breakfast was reasonably priced (7.50) though they didn't tell us when we checked in and paid for breakfast in advance that there were less expensive versions available which I would have preferred. The full breakfast includes eggs, back bacon, broiled tomatoes, baked beans, toast, juice, very bad coffee, assorted cereals, some sliced fruit, yogurt, croissants... There is a cheaper continental version available that includes everything except the hot dishes. Altogether, though there were some things I didn't like (coffee in particular), I thought that on the whole it was acceptable. My husband was absolutely delighted!On our first night we were late and tired so we ate dinner in the hotel. Bad mistake! Avoid that. There are several good looking ethnic restaurants around the corner in Hogarth Road. We ate in a good Indian restaurant there and we also spotted Thai and (I think) Chinese. There are also a couple of English pubs on Earl's Court Road near the underground station. Try one of those instead.One point to beware of is that this hotel comes in two large sections. Contrary to common sense, the quiet rooms are the rooms facing the street. If you use a mapping program with satellite pictures (Google for example) and look at 11 Knaresborough Ct, London, you will see that the District Line underground tracks go right under both buildings. It appears that on the north-eastern of the two buildings there is shielding over the tracks so the rooms overlooking them might not be very noisy. However, the south-western building (the main one where the reception and dining room are) directly overlooks the tracks on its back side. Do not accept a room on that side. I bet it's really noisy. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the street and it was very quiet even though, on our last night, I had the window open.Some people grumble about having to cross the street from the main building to get to the north-eastern one. I did not find it particularly onerous, though it was odd.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, though I would prefer one with more charm. However, for charm you either pay more money or you pay with lack of elevators. For people with limited mobility (as my husband is), this was the better choice. It not only had elevators, it also had handicapped ramps so that it was wheel-chair accessible."
78,1061,"Apr 22 2008 	Great Location Friendly Staff Large Clean Quiet Rooms	I have the opportunity to travel to London a few times a year with my wife, and actually prefer Earls Court and Kensington, as the neighborhoods have great transportation options, and are full of the type of resturants where non-expense account types of folks enjoy eating out at various resturants (yes we have our favorites)I generally book via Hotwire or Priceline but this time got a deal through BA (British Air) Although this is a budget oriented place, the rooms are large and very well taken care of. The only drawback or downside is that they have liquid pump bottles in the bath for shampoo and hand soap. I simply bought a bar of soap at the store and I was fine. The room was so clean and quiet (not always the case in Priceline 4 stars') And I am sold on the location.....you can ride into London on the tube and its less than a 5 minute walk from the Earl's Court Station. Anyone interested in walking tours should look for &quot;London Walks&quot; I found it on my last trip and I cannot wait to go back.This is a far better place to stay than &quot;tour oriented&quot; hotels.Its small and you can almost hear a pin drop, its so quiet.It is a bit plain, but its modern and very clean. On this type of trip I shop by price and location and this was a fantastic find.Without the British Air deal its a bit pricier than I'd like, but I'd still check it out - prior to hitting the purchase button on Hotwier or Priceline."
79,1061,"Apr 21 2008 	Basic friendly ok location	Stayed at Premier Inn Kensington for one night in April. The hotel is very basic, no frills, but good value for money. Would have expected a fridge and a safe in the room though. Staff was very friendly. Location is ok, depending on your schedule. For the museums (science, natural history, v&amp;a) it's great, only 10 min walk. Knightsbridge and hyde park another 10-15 min. For westminster, tower, british museum etc. it's quite far away."
80,1061,"Apr 20 2008 	Good location no frills	We stayed here with my three year old son who had a bed in our room, this made the room a little crammed but would have been fine for 2 people. The room itself is adequate but a little tatty, the bathroom was showing its age and liquid soap provided wasn't very nice. The breakfast staff were absolutely wonderful - very obliging and helpful - excellent food! The dinner staff and the food were mediocre to poor. I waited more than 40 minutes for dinner and then the mash potato was cold and lumpy. The restaurants on Earl's Court Road were great - recommend the Gourmet Burger place. Cleaning staff were nice, our son wet the bed one night and we requested fresh bed linen and the bed was all beautifully made up the next day.. Excellent proximity to Earl's Court Tube station making the trip to and from Heathrow easy."
81,1061,"Apr 20 2008 	Excellent value and location	This hotel is excellent value in an excellent location. I have stayed here twice, once for business and once for pleasure and both stays have been first class.If you are a visitor who wants your hotel stay to be part of your English cultural and architectural experience, this hotel is not for you. There are no high ceilings, fireplaces or chandeliers, room service or doormen. It is a clean functional well located hotel (part of a chain) offering extremely good value in London.The hotel is a two minute walk from Earls Court tube station and really easy to find. Earls Court tube is a ten minute ride to Oxford Circus and the Earls Court area is a pleasant area to stay in. I am really baffled by one reviewer on this site saying she could not find the tube station after asking for directions. The rooms are large, very clean with big clean bathrooms and very comfortable king size beds, triple glazing and blackout curtains for a peaceful night's sleep. The hotel chain even offers a Good Night Guarantee, offering your money back if you don't get a good night's sleep.Breakfast is extra, around 7.95 and you don't have to book, which is great if you are not sure if you want to eat first thing in the morning. You can eat as much as you like for the set price and there are all sorts of deals on kids eating for free.I usually like to treat myself to stays in four star-plus hotels but this hotel really competes with some top places I have stayed in for comfort and service.The key to this hotel is that there are lots of deals for families on rooms, eating and trips out.I only live an hour from London and could jump on a train and come home for comfort, but I will book this hotel again when I fancy staying late in the city and want a guaranteed clean, good value location."
82,1061,"Apr 9 2008 	Cheap and nasty	A few words of advice: don't stay here.Booked in order to get to an early meeting, reasoning that it had to be better than getting up at 4.30am. Bad call.Asked for a quiet room at the back  was given a noisy one at the front.Puce plastic much in evidence, throw on the bed grubby, bathroom cramped and seedy, bed hard and lumpy.Final straw was asking directions to the tube in the morning and being sent in totally the wrong direction, so I almost missed the meeting and arrived hot and flustered as well as tired and cross.Yes, it's cheap. It's also nasty. I'd rather get up at 4.30am than stay here again."
83,1061,"Apr 5 2008 	Great value great location!	Like previous reviewers I purchased this hotel through a great deal on the British Airways website and after glowing reviews from this site! The location was excellent, a few minutes walk from Earl's Court Tube and from many great restaurants, cafes and shops, including a supermarket which was open till midnight. Easy to get there and to get around - what more could you ask for!Hotel itself was great, big rooms for the price, lovely bed and tv. View not fantastic, but since I spent little time in the hotel this didn't matter. I was on the first floor at the front and did not get disturbed by any noise, either from fellow guests or traffic. Breakfast wasn't great, but with so many places nearby to choose from this was not a problem.I would certainly stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending it to everyone!"
84,1061,"Apr 1 2008 	Great Deal in a Perfect Location	Just came back from a 3-night stay here. Booked it through British Airways Holidays. It was clean, modern. The room was larger than any I've stayed in before in London. 1 block from the Earl's Court tube station, which very conveniently, is on the Piccadilly line that comes directly from Heathrow. So we were at the hotel about 1 hour after landing at Heathrow. Didn't have to deal with taxi prices or express trains to faraway stations. Heathrow to Earl's Court was exactly 1/2 hour. The District line also stops at Earl's Court, so it was so easy to get anywhere with minimal transferring. The Gloucester station was a little further, but that gives you access to the Circle line. So the hotel was very conveniently located.The staff were very nice. One morning we had no hot water on our side of the hotel, so they quickly came to our room with a key to another room that had working hot water, and we used that shower. They held our luggage for a few hours after we checked out.The shower had tremendous water pressure - a big plus! A hot water pot for tea in the room. Separate reading lights on each side of the bed (Unfortunately too rare in hotels!)A big minus to the hotel is that there is no computer facilities for guests. So it was impossible to print out our boarding pass the night before. However, there are 2 internet cafes just around the corner. But who wants to spend any extra money on that?In all, a wonderful place to be for a few days in London."
85,1061,"Mar 13 2008 	Great value for London	Booked this hotel after seeing lots of great reviews and wasn't disappointed. While the hotel is not overly flash to look at, it was modern and clean. The staff were very friendly and the location is excellent for easy transport connections.Only downside was the hotel wouldn't store our luggage for four days when we went to Rome citing security issues - can't see what the issues would be. Seeing we were coming back for another six days they could have been more accomodating on this. Overall the hotel was great value for london"
86,1061,"Mar 5 2008	Very comfy bed and good neighbourhood	I chose the PI Kensington based on my positive experience with the PI Kings Cross in the past. My main considerations, then and now, were proximity to a Piccadilly line tube station (as I was coming directly from Heathrow), cleanliness, comfortable bed and reasonable price for all of the above. This hotel is literally around the corner from the Marriott Kensington, where I had also stayed for 3 nights, but moved here for my holiday's remainder due to the much more reasonable price. Having asked for a room on the higher floors (due to previous comments about the lower floors being noisy thanks to the underground running below), the management was able to accommodate me by giving me a room in their building across the street - this hotel is made up of two buildings facing each other and joined by an enclosed bridge. Some might consider it a hassle to have to walk all the way there to one's room and back over the bridge again to the main building (which has the only entrance &amp; exit), but I thought it was a nice walk!Check-in was easy, the room was clean and the bed was nearly as comfortable as being at home. Apparently, the PI chain is known for their great beds, and being the second PI where I've stayed, I find this to be true. Otherwise, there are no real frills - not much space to store and hang clothes, not a lot of TV channel choices and no real amenities (bring your own soap!), but the kettle and supplies each day were much appreciated. This neighbourhood is my favourite to stay in while in London, as it is safe, not pricey and very close to several good grocery stores (including Waitrose and a 24-hour Sainsbury's) and restaurants (Garfunkels was great). Breakfast was OK, but for some reason not as great, quality-wise, as I remember when I stayed at PI Kings Cross in 2006."
87,1061,"Feb 27 2008 	Good standard value-for-money accommodation	One of the nicer PTI properties - very centrally located close to the Tube station and near the high street. Friendly and helpful staff. Usual buffet breakfast, which is always good and now with &quot;healthy options&quot; too. Reduced rate access to a health club is available to guests. Rooms facing the road can be loud."
88,1061,"Feb 24 2008 	Great Value and Location	Just got back after staying 4 nights at this hotel. I stayed in a family room with my two sons age 17 and 11. For the price I paid the value can't be beat. The room was very clean, quiet, comfortable and the location at Earl's Court was great with both the Picaddily and District lines giving us easy access all over London. It would have been nice to have a few more channels on the television, but that is being picky. The staff was very helpful and hard working. I thought the restaurant was fine, but understaffed. However, the staff they did have was moving a mile a minute to accomodate everyone. I would certainly stay here again.Note if you come into Earl's Court via the tube, you can't see the Premier Inn when you exit the station. What you do is cross the street, make a slight left as you head to the corner, then turn right and walk to the end of the block (about two minutes), then make a right and you will see it.Note a few tips about wireless internet access. You can access the FON network and get 24 hours for 3 pounds, which is much cheaper than the network the hotel is using. Just &quot;view available wireless networks&quot; and connect to FON. They also give you 15 minutes free to try it out.Also, the bakery across from the Earl's Court station has great food at great prices."
89,1061,"Feb 19 2008 	Just got back and LOVED it.	This hotel is exactly what everyone said, which is great because i booked it based on the reviews here. Decent clean rooms..not too small. Perfectly close to Earl's Court tube station and great shops and restaurants nearby. the GBK (Gourmet Burger Kitchen) on Earl's Court Road is fantastic. My kids have stayed with me in many types of hotels, including fancy ones, and they loved this one as well. They kept saying &quot;i give this place 5 stars&quot;. it's not luxurious but the value for the money is unbeatable. Full Breakfast buffet is free for under 16s and only 7 1/2 pounds for adults. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times of the day and night. A PERFECT place for families."
90,1061,"Feb 18 2008	Second stay and would stay again	Stayed here in mid January for three nights with girlfriend, and this was also my second stay at the hotel. Booked through BA.com holidays at an unbeatable price, and got everything we paid for.Rooms are always clean. Comfy, large beds. Clean bathroom with a tub. We got a room in the 5th floor looking out on the tube-lines, but with no problems at all. You have to be a really light sleeper to wake up from the trains. The hotel has a good restaurant and a bar on the ground floor and the staff is quite helpful. The hotel is just 5 minutes slow walk from the Earl's Court underground station, and the Earl's Court Road with plenty of restaurants, shops, and a few pubs.Would definitely stay again. The only thing that was a set-back was that we were unable to have an early check-in."
91,1061,"Jan 20 2008 	premium premier inn	Good sized room for London, especially for the money. Super close to Tube, grocers, internet cafe, and more. Plenty of hot water that never runs out!!! If you are there in the winter the room is nice and warm. Not the best view from our room, but who needs that. Everything was neat and clean. Restuarant in the hotel is average. The best nearby restaurant is Its All Greek To Me."
92,1061,"Jan 5 2008 	Definitely the place to go for!	We decided to try our luck after visiting the hotel website and reading comments on Tripadvisor.com and we weren't deceived!A well-situated hotel in a friendly area full of locals, loads of shops to stop at (Boots, M&amp;S, a chemist, a post-office, good pubs to eat at, Indian and Chines restaurants, laundrettes, banks...) and only a 3-minute walk from the tube station. The hotel was nice and our room for three was spacious, the beds were very comfortable and the rooms well-isolated (we never heard anything coming from the next-door rooms nor from the street)! The waiters were exceedingly nice and very helpful. We felt just at home! The breakfast was just perfect and we never lacked of anything. We never had to wait either to be seated. We tried the restaurant too and the service was good, so was the food.The cleaning ladies were discreet and very efficient. We could even leave our lugage in a luggage room on our final day and our luggage was carefully labelled by the staff and placed in a secured room so we never feared for them to disappear or be damaged. When we took our luggage back, a member of staff personally get it for us checking the labels twice to make sure there was no mistake.Premier Inn Kensington Hotel is definitely a place to go for for those who want to stay at a clean and comfortable place in a well-situated part of London within easy access to the London Top Ten places to see! We're used to spend some time in Paris and the quality of the French hotels there based on a the same budget is extremely poor compared to Premier Inn ... not even mentionning the cold welcome you get there! And I won't mention hygiene in Paris either!Mrs Souesme, France."
93,1061,"Dec 24 2007 	Great Hotel	Following various stays at other hotels in London, the Premier Travel Inn Kensington was a breath of fresh air. Great staff, large rooms and a decent bathroom. Extremely clean hotel with a great location.I will definitely not look for another hotel when visiting London."
94,1061,"Dec 19 2007 	Best bang for my buck in London!	My wife and I stayed at the Premier Kensington while visiting London at the end of October. Compared to most London hotels in this price range, this place is a real gem. Very clean and well maintained. Spacious and clean room with nice furniture by London standards. Attentive and very helpful staff/front desk. All our requests were promptly and cheerfully handled. The location could not be better. Nice quiet neighborhood and very close to the tube. Plenty of shopping, dining, pubs, grocery stores, pharmacies nearby for anything you may need. Made us feel right at home around the neighborhood. The hotel is by no means luxurious. For the price we paid, we couldn't have asked for more. We definitely would stay there again and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great budget hotel in London."
95,1061,"Nov 30 2007 	A little disappointed	I am a regular customer of Premier Inn; although clearly a budget chain, the quality and standards are usually dependable i.e. you know what to expect. However, I think their Kensington hotel lets them down.In their defence, the hotel is currently being refurbished so it is possible that in a few months time, improvements will be seen. When I stayed last week though I was not impressed by the standard of the room. It was minimalist - as is typical at Premier Inn - but there wasn't even any shelf space to place clothes and other belongings.... only a hanging rail with six hangers. You usually get a floor to ceiling storage unit with 3 to 4 shelves but not here. The ceiling tiles were very old-fashioned and discoloured, much in need of replacement. Similarly, the bathroom fittings appeared tired and ready to be ripped out.The room was very clean and everything was in working order. The shower was extremely powerful and very hot.... makes a change sometimes!Also, the sealing on the double-glazed window was worn so that there was a very slight gap when the window was closed. Just enough to let in the London traffic noise! By jamming a toilet roll between the window catch and the window, I got a very peaceful night's sleep.Finally, I always check the exact location of any hotel that I book. For those not familiar with London, please note that the &quot;Kensington Premier Inn&quot; is not actually in Kensington but in Earls Court! Not a problem for me but if you wanted to be right in Kensington you've an extra 10 minutes walk."
96,1061,"Nov 23 2007 	A safe option	Positives:1. Great location2. Close to Subway stop3. CLEAN!4. Offers a free stay to children (and a free pullout sofa bed)The only negative I can think of is that it is a chain hotel, so if you're looking for the ambiance of an English B and B, you won't find that here. However, the hotel offers a safe, clean, and comfortable stay and you don't risk ruining your vacation by staying in a dodgy hotel. Would definitely stay here again!"
97,1061,"Nov 23 2007 	Great alternative to using Heathrow Airport hotels!	Just to add to other reviewers comments.. if you want a hassle-free and reasonable-cost night in London this is a great hotel. I used it en-route to Heathrow, as it is less than 5 minutes form the Earls Court tube station on the Picadilly line. The tube is easy, 40 minutes to heathrow, and better than airport hotels with all their hassle of airport hoppa buses etc.The room was spotless, very quiet - not always the case in london - and the restaurant was excellent. Friendly staff, and of course their 'full satisaction guarantee'.A very good hotel."
98,1061,"Nov 22 2007	Northerner in London	Stayed at this hotel for one night, very good location, only 5 mins walk from tube station. Clean and comfy room, staff very helpful and friendly. Exactly what you'd expect from a travel inn. Breakfast was very nice too, no complaints at all."
99,1061,"Nov 18 2007 	No drawers!	Why oh why do they not provide drawer space?I know I can pile my socks etc on the open plan wardrobe shelf, but it's hardly an alternative.Room OK, bathroom adequate, breakfast barely adequate...Never again."
100,1061,"Nov 7 2007 	Superb!	This hotel is great. Simply....lovely, recently refurbished, modern and clean..all the things I look for when staying at a hotel!...and I'm fussy! I will definately stay here again! Location is good, literally 2 mins from Earls Court tube station and Earls Court, about 20 mins tube ride from the hotel to Leicester Square/Oxford Street, you don't even notice the journey. The beds are so comfy, and I felt really relaxed in the room...some rooms feel like a hotel room..this kind of felt like home a little bit. It was clean and modern which was a bonus. I didn't have breakfast but for only 7.50 you could eat as much as you like. Some hotels in London got dodgy reviews, but trust me this one is great. Front reception were friendly and helpful."
101,1061,"Nov 7 2007 	Perfect!	Stayed here for 3 nights during Halloween break and have only good things to say about the place. The staff was exceptionally friendly, even the housekeeping ladies would pop their heads out of the rooms to say hello when we would pass through the halls (which I can't say I have ever seen before).The room was a little small but fit us fine and was clean. The BBCBeebies channel was a perfect end to every day for the kids to unwind before bed. The only complaint I have is that we had to take an elevator up to the next level then walk down the cold hall (above street) to the next elevator and up to the next floor to our room. A bit of a maze really that was a bit annoying. They really need to put an entrance on the other side of the street to save people the hassle."
102,1061,"Nov 5 2007 	good location	Rooms were very clean , although slightly small, as stayed in a family room (2 adults 2 children). .Location very good only a 2 minute walk from Earls Court Tube. Very nice breakfast the next morning, staff were very helpful and polite, the young Eastern European gentleman who showed us to our table was fab.I think his name was Aisia. All in all value for money."
103,1061,"Nov 2 2007 	Reasonably priced hotel in a great location	Stayed here with 2 clients a few weekends ago. Location is great: handy for Earls Court tube and with loads of shops and pubs / restaurants nearby. Rooms are standard Pti fayre but pretty good. My clients complained of a lack of (shower, not bath) water pressure but mine (in a room in the annexe over a freezing cold bridge) was fine.Pti will store lugagge before and after checkin / out for free, which is a bonus but this is dependent on space I imagine. Make sure you keep your luggage tags though. Only niggle was that the breakfast area got VERY full at peak times and you ended up having to wait quite a long time before being seated."
104,1061,"Oct 31 2007 	Great location and value	We had two free nights in London as part of a British Airways promotion and chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were very happy the room and location and felt we chose well. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Earls Court Tube, which is conveniently on the Piccadilly Line from Heathrow. Earls Court Road is busy and loud but naresborough Place is not so bad and traffic drops off after 11 PM or so. The room was clean and fairly large. And quiet. We were at the end of a hallway and heard almost no noise from other guests, which is always surprising in a big city. Our only complaint is that there was no dresser or something similar so we had to keep our suitcases handy.The breakfast buffet seemed okay but we didn't buy it, opting instead for cafes in the area. We especially recommend Mor-ish Cafe on Earls Court Road, which had outstanding coffee, pastries and English fry-ups. The King's Head pub on Hogarth Place is also worth a visit.You'll be hard pressed to find this combination of value and location elsewhere in London. Highly recommended."
105,1061,"Oct 15 2007 	GREAT location!	This hotel is in a fantastic location! Literally a 2 minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station with places to eat all within walking distance. The room we had is large by UK standards and very comfortable. The only thing is that we were on the third floor facing the train lines so we could hear the trains all the time but even despite that, we really enjoyed our stay there and will be going back again in a few days. Oh another thing, this hotel is GREAT value for your money in London!!! The breakfast is not that great but we ate there one day because it was convenient. Can't wait to go back."
106,1061,"Sep 19 2007 	Pretty good deal for expensive London	We had stayed at the Premier Travel Inn two years ago and came back for a week earlier this month. It's clean, more than convenient to the Earl's Court Underground station, and kind of American-styled. The only down sides (and we noticed this the first time, too) is that (1) there are no drawers in the rooms and (2) the TV reception is fuzzy, as though they're sharing their cable with too many other places. There's a closet with plenty of hangers for shirts, pants and dresses, but no drawers anywhere. You either keep all your underwear and socks in your luggage or you put them on a table. I asked why, and was told it was a matter of &quot;policy.&quot; Weird, but it's a clean, quiet place with good service. The U.S. dollar is pretty much in the tank right now, but, including tax, we paid about $180 per night. That's not cheap, but in London, it's not bad at all."
107,1061,"Sep 1 2007 	Great For Family excellent location	Thanks to all the reviews on tripadvisor, we had a fantastic 5 nights at this hotel. I managed to book the room for 70 a night which was a bargin for the 3 of us.Firstly location - 2 minute walk from tube station, lovely selection of local shops in the immediate area. I was concerned about evening meals as my husband and daughter can be fussy but when I saw a Subway, KFC, Burgerking, bakery, Sommerfield supermarket and a Marks and Spencer foodstore so close to the hotel I new they would be happy.Hotel - loved the breakfasts especially as up to 2 children can eat free with 1 paying adult. I am not a breakfast person but when I saw the selection of food on offer it made sense to eat well and it kept me going until dinner. The room was very comfortable and the sofa bed was large enough that my husband at 6'2 had a good nights sleep. The beds and pillows were comfortable and we never heard any noises from the other rooms next to us which was great for me as I am a light sleeper.We will definitly come back to this hotel again.Tip - take a double plug socket if you need more as only two single sockets in room, I always pack one as by the time you charge camera, mobiles, hairstraighteners etc there is never enough."
108,1061,Aug 21 2007	clean room 	Great location for Earls Court tube at end of Zone 1. Our family room was clean &amp; comfortable but a little cramped with 2 teenage children. We stayed in room 304 at Hotel front which seemed to be the quiet side as underground line to rear of Hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.
109,1061,"Aug 19 2007 	Great location lovely hotel	Me and my fiance stayed at this hotel, and had one of the best nights sleep we have had!!The rooms are nice and large, with a comfy bed. They are very clean.We didnt notice any noise from the traffic outside, and found the hotel easy to find once we had got off the tube.We didnt eat in the restaurant and missed breakfast."
110,1061,"Aug 11 2007 	loved breakfast	Very pleased with everything about this hotel.The location was good near to the underground.The room we had a triple was very nice and clean.The special deal for breakfast was very good as my travelling party was myself, my granddaughter and her friend and their breakfasts were free as children.No complaints at all would definitely book this chain or same hotel again"
111,1061,"Aug 8 2007 	comfortable AND economical	We booked a three day trip to London and with lodging thru British Air and upgraded the hotel to Premier Travel Inn, Kensington based on the reviews here in Trip Advisor. We spent three nights before traveling to visit our son at Mildenhall RAF for several days before returning home. The rooms were very clean, some wear but that's expected. The location was superb. The food at the restaurant was average. The staff was very helpful although they never delivered the newspaper they offered me. We would stay here again."
112,1061,"Aug 6 2007 	Terrific Place	Let's get the bad out of the way. The rooms are not immaculate - there's some wear and tear in the bathroom, such as chipped paint and worn wood paneling. You needed to &quot;jiggle&quot; the toilet before it would flush (I figured it out just in time. Would've been really embarrassing to go down to the front desk and ask, &quot;Hi! I'm a yokel from America and I can't seem to figure out how to flush the toilets in your fine country here.&quot;). And the internet is expensive. Wireless internet access is in-room through Swisscom - the lowest cost is 3 pounds for 30 minutes, but the better deal is 5 pounds for 120 minutes. Now let's deal with the good, which is everything else. FAMILY ROOMOne of the few places that I could find that had full family rooms - one double-sized bed for the parents and two twin beds for the kids. The room was clearly a triple with a twin bed on the floor, but it didn't matter - it was perfect for our needs. Our room had a full bathtub/shower. If you plan on watching television, they have about a dozen channels - BBC1, BBC2, Channel 4, ITV, BBC News, CBBC (for kids), Men &amp; Motors. STAFFVery young, very friendly go-getters. From the front desk to the restaurant, everybody was upbeat and smiling. LOCATIONEarls Court is a fantastic location. The hotel is one block away from the Earl's Court Tube stop - which has connections to the Circle line, District Line, and Piccadilly Lines. Those three lines can get you almost anywhere. The neighborhood feels very safe - it's a good mix of very nice flats and hotels. Finding it was very easy - just exit the tube station, cross the street, and then walk one block until you see the purple Premier Travel Inn sign. There are a lot of great eateries within two blocks of the hotel. From nicer places like Wagamama, Masala Zone, and Gourmet Burger Kitchen, to fast food like McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, and Subway. Plus there're several Chinese restaurants, Indian, Korean, and more. To save money, you can shop at the markets - there are two right there, where you can grab pre-packaged sandwiches (TIP - skip the sandwiches, go for the fresh bread and pastries in the back. If you need more protein, grab a pack of luncheon meat and eat it with your fresh bread). Or if you get tired of the markets, you can try the Filipino market or the Russian market. There's a post office across the street from the Tube station, at least two Internet Cafes, a Barclay's bank (TIP - if you use Bank of America, you can use Barclay's ATMs without extra fees), newsstands, and a couple laundromats (TIP - if you use the laundromat on Hogarth's, they don't have a change machine. During the day, you can get change next door from the tailor - but at night, you MUST have exact change). OTHER STUFF ABOUT THE HOTELRestaurant served a good breakfast. Excellent security, since you need a room key to operate the elevator. Our room faced the street and we didn't have any issues with street noise. SUMMARYGreat great experience. Will definitely stay there again."
113,1061,"Aug 2 2007 	Great place	We are a family of 4 (2 girls aged 7&amp;4) and have just spent 7 nights at this hotel. First thing is the location: it's just 2-3 minutes from Earls Court tube station; when you exit the sation take the road in front of you (Earls Court Gardens-there's a pub called Courtfiled in the corner) and the hotel is at the end of this street to your left.We travelled with friends and had asked to have rooms together, which they did since they had our request on the computer.The room was ok for 4 people, with comfy beds and extra pillows. Our daugthers had a sofa-bed and a pull-out bed, both very comfy as well. The toilet was quite big and with plenty of hot water for all of us and good pressure; towels changed every day with extra ones in the wardrobe, and it was a proper wardrobe and not just shelves.They supplied every day with tea, coffee, milk and sugar and snack biscuits. Room done every day.We had a room on the other building, which may seem a maze to get to (have to change lifts) but we were not facing the trains and being on the fourth floor gave us great night sleep."
114,1061,"Jul 29 2007 	Wonderful Stay!!!	My granddaughter and I visited London for her 11th birthday. We chose the Premier Travel Inn Kensington over the internet and were thrilled to find such a wonderful place to stay! The rooms were large, air conditioned, and clean with beds that were very comfortable. Also, the hotel is near the Earl's Court tube station, but still quiet I have visited London several times prior to this and never stayed in a hotel as roomy as this. The staff was very kind and caring to both myself and my granddaughter. I would encourage anyone to stay in this hotel."
115,1061,"Jul 12 2007 	Very comfortable	Stayed at Kenso Premier Travel Inn for 5 nights in July 07. Family of 4 (kids 9 and 11) squeezed into a standard room, but it was still spacious enough to move around the kids beds (one was a trundle bed normally kept under the double bed, the other was the sofa) and our 3 large luggage bags. Plus 4 or 5 small bags.After reading reviews on other London hotels it seemed we would be completely squashed in, but not here, so although not huge, us 4 were reasonably comfortable.Bathroom whilst really clean was a bit tired looking &amp; could've had a small renovation done, but overall pretty good and also big enough to move about in.The restaurant downstairs was excellent. Not great choice of meals, but sufficient for most palates &amp; the buffet breakfast was superb. The wait-staff lacked a bit of English so we had some fun with our Aussie lingo.Really easy to find - a short 2 or 3 minute walk up from Earls Court underground station. And an easy 30 min walk to Kensington Palace.Overall - fantastic."
116,1061,"Jul 10 2007 	Very nice!	My family (two adults &amp; two kids 12 &amp;13) stayed at the Premier Travel Inn Kensington July 4-7, 2007. I selected this hotel based on comments I read here on Trip Advisor and comparing to other places to stay while in London. We paid 290 GBP for three nights - 96.67 GBP/night or $580 for three nights or $193.33/night. This does seem expensive considering the type of accomodation and location outside central London, but that's what it is. As you get closer to central London, the prices will just keeping going up. The accomodations were as expected, clean room with a modern appearance. The staff were very friendly and the daily maid service was fine.We ate breakfast at the hotel cafe for 15 GBP for the family - kids under 16 eat for free.The hotel is located about 5 minutes walk from Earls Court underground station - where you can get to anyplace in London. You can also catch the Picadilly line direct to/from Heathrow airport at this station.There are many stores and places to eat around the tube station, although the demographics of the population here may cause some to think twice about walking around late at night.Overall, I'd stay here again when vsisting London."
117,1061,Jun 24 2007	Fantastic hotel	I booked this hotel for a weekend break in London. You just need two nights to really experience all you can of the vibrant city.The hotel was very clean and the specifications where of a really high standard. The beds were very comfortable and there was a lot of space. The hotel is located on Knaresborough place and is 2minutes walk from the Gloucester road tube station.I found this hotel to be such a comfortable stay that i have booked rooms in it again this year when family visits for Christmas
118,1061,"Jun 9 2007 	Good Value	We stayed at the Premier Travel Inn Kensington during the early part of May 2007 based, in part, on other Trip Advisor reviews. We were completely satisfied and would definitely return.This location is in a quiet residential neighborhood about a five minute walk to the Earl's Court tube stop. This location was extremely convenient for our return journey to Heathrow Airport.The room was very clean and sufficiently large (by London standards). We booked this room through British Airways Holidays. The price we paid was very reasonable for central London. The staff was friendly.On our trip, we started and ended in London. At the beginning of our trip, we stayed at another Premier Travel Inn location. Our experience was the same as this one. Based on our two stays, I would stay at any location of the Premier Travel Inn chain of hotels without hesitation."
119,1061,"Jun 3 2007 	nice hotel	We stayed at the Kensington Travel Inn for 1 night on a trip to london to see a show at RAH. Hotel very convenient for underground station, the staff were very good, rooms basic but clean. Due to very bad weather, we decided to eat in the hotel for dinner rather than walk about in the rain looking for a restaurant. We were very impressed by the standard of the meal and the waiters couldn't have been more attentive. We also had breakfast the next morning and again this was better than we have had at other travel inns. Would definitely use this Travel Inn again."
120,1061,"May 31 2007 	Best Kept Secret Hotel in London!	Booked via the hotel's website after a long research for our first London trip. Readinfg trip advisor's reviews was really helpful. Stayed for 7 days between May 22-29 as a family of two adults and our 15 year old son. Staff was very friendly. Reasonably priced, room was bigger than we thought it would be. Nice bath room and high pressured shower was great. we were in fourth floor so noise from the nearby subway trains was undetected. Even it was a smoking room (non-smoking rooms were unavailable at the time) it was very clean and did not smell any smoke. Only 3 minutes to the nearby tube Earls Court station, was a great asset. My advise is to bring or buy bar soap. Hotel does notprovide that. There is a shompoo dispenser and a foam soap dispenser.Also there are great grocery stores (specially Marks &amp; Spencers Simply food) and drug stores (Boots)near the tube. Did not have breakfast in the hotel, even age 15 and down eats free, it was still a stiff 7.50 per person. Instead had breakfast at the bakery across from the tube station. For 3 people cost less than 7 pounds. Nice reastaurants in the area. We specially liked the &quot;NANDOs&quot;, spanish-portugese restaurant on the Earl's Court street, and Chinese restaurant Dragon King was very nice too. The area is very safe and quiet. We strongly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back and stay there any chance we are back in London."
121,1061,"Apr 18 2007 	Great value Great Location	Firstly - the location combined with the price makes this one of the best value london hotels i have stayed in. As previosuly mentioned - the bustling centre of earls court (including tube station) is just a couple of minutes away along a safe residential street.Check in was very efficiently handled. I got a room overlooking the tube lines but the triple glazing meant that it wasn't a problem - the air conditioning worked fine. If you're the type that doesn't like a stuffy room and needs the window open make sure you ask for one of the rooms over the road.Room was spacious by London standards, perfectly clean and had all the equipment you'd expect in a budget hotel.Bar and restaurant were both very nice, and the service was exceptional.Breakfast is excellent value - great service, excellent food, wide selection including a cooked to order hot option and good quality.I'll stay here again!"
122,1061,"Apr 16 2007 	Clean Accessible and Good Value	Excellent Clean Hotel with friendly service 24 hours a day especially from Pash at reception. Rooms clean and comfortable albeit small (this IS London - so I expected small rooms and besides you don't spend a whole lot of time in there either - too much to see and do). We loved how close it is to Earls Court Station and yummy Baker's Oven cuppa. Reception also provided friendly advice and information on London transport services and other local information.On the downside: didn't like the noise of the trains on our first nite there. We asked to be moved to the quieter side of the hotel and were moved the very next day. The beds in every room have very weak spongy mattresses/foam so if you have a bad back, beware.Overall pleasant stay and good service.Will definitely return for a second stay."
123,1061,"Apr 2 2007 	down and out in kensington	About as bare-boned a hotel as one can imagine - unless you count the foam soap dispensed in the bathroom as an amenity. I think this was the first time that I stayed in a hotel with a bathroom that was not tiled - it had some kind pf pressboard floor. It is in a pretty good location though. We stayed for free on a British Airways deal which - from start to finish - proved the adage &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; Happily, after our two free nights we moved on to better things!"
124,1061,"Apr 2 2007 	Highly recommended	Stayed in this hotel for one night on a theatre trip. Very convenient for the museums (10 minute walk).Hotel superbly clean, rooms big enough if you just need somewhere to put your head down for the night.Only gripe is the bathrooms are not very well lit.Breakfast is an &quot;eat as much as you can&quot; buffet. If its not included in the price of your room it is 7.50 pp. Not bad value especially if you are a big eater in the mornings."
125,1061,"Mar 30 2007 	Good location	Close to Earls Court tube with pubs and restaurants nearby, so ideal location. same as any other hotel in this group once inside, but a decent price for London. Front desk staff were apologetic for putting us in a room directly over the tube line but we didn't notice the noise at all and the kids just loved watching the trains go in and out of the station!"
126,1061,"Mar 12 2007 	very convenient and nice	I was there with my husband and my two little children. London is very expensive place, but this hotel had affordable price, so I was a bit afraid it might turn out to be a shabby one. However, to my surprise, its location was excellent, only three minute walk from Earl's court subway station, but surprisingly quiet neighborhood. The front dest staff were not very friendly, but the room and its bathroom were clean and well-air conditioned. One setback was that there was no fridge in the room. I recommend this hotel to people who look for a clean hotel in a great location for sightseeing in London."
127,1061,"Jan 13 2007 	I want to go to london again!	Stay here early January while visiting my gf in england. We visited london twice during the trip and stayed in diff hotels and i must say this hotel is so much better compared to the other that i stayed at and it only costs abt 10 pounds more. The location is excellent - Earl's Court is one of the most centralised tube stations around and u can travel to any attarctions wthin a hort time and without changing tube lines. You can also travel to Earl's court from heathrow airport directly by piccadilly line and takes only abt 40 mins. Check in was fast and staff are nice and courteous. you can also deposit your lugguage at the hotel b4 check in or after check out.The hotel room we got was very spacious. It was clean and well equipped with desk, chair, TV and a nice and huge double bed. Didnt try the breakfast though as there were lots of nice resturants around. Try the chinese resturant opp the tube station of you like &quot;tim sum&quot;. The only issue we had was there wasnt an extra linen below the blanket/comforter - there is no way to know if the blanket are ebing washed regularly so we had to request for an extra linen at tthe reception to put beneath it when we sleep.Overall we enjoyed our stay there and this hotel will be 1st choice when visit london again."
128,1061,"Jan 8 2007 	Great Value Hotel. Lovely breakfast	This is a great hotel for a one night stay, or longer if you are on your own or travelling as a couple. We were a family of four, with two young boys.We ordered a family room but ended up with a double room and a couple of extra beds. This made it extremely squeezy both in the room and in the bathroom. Not to complain though - were weren't charged any extra - which is a bonus in this town.We were travelling with husband's mother who was on her own. She was given a room on the same floor as us, which evidently is a departure from policy. We were given rooms at the back of the hotel (a bit of a hike actually, over an enclosed road overpass) but at least that meant we had relative peace and quiet.Breakfast is seven and a half quid - a bit steep until you see what you get. Unlimited amounts of good quality food and something for everybody. Children 10 and under eat free, so it ended up being extremely affordable for us to have breakfast there. They even serve Costa coffee!We were very early checking in but the receptionist couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. We only had to wait an hour or so before they found us the best available rooms. They very kindly allowed us to take advantage of the breakfast even though technically we weren't hotel guests at that stage. There is also a luggage room if the wait is going to be longer and you want to wander about a bit.The hotel is not far from Earl's Court tube and lots of internet cafes and cheap (for London) restaurants. It's not in too bad a position at all really.Overall, this is a reasonable hotel, especially considering the price for London. I'd definitely stay there again if I were on a bit of a tight budget but still wanted a big breakfast to get me through the day."
129,1061,"Jan 3 2007 	what a great value and location	We booked this as a package thru British airways. I was expecting a room and bath with nothing else with the potential for noise. We got a hotel that was enough for three people (two adults and one child) one block away from EArls court (go out of hotel and make a right and it is at the end of the street) the staff was extremely helpful and as we took the red eye we stored our luggage and walked over to kensington palace to start our day. the breakfast is Ok, my daughter had a hard time with the food in england as a whole so I don't think this hotel's was any worse than anything else. However, for $15 american I would walk down to the bakery, subway, or Mcdonalds if you have children. (they are near to the tube) there are alot of places to eat by the hotel if the food there doesn't suit you. There is also a small bar and when we returned from teh new years eye celebration they were serving and were pleasant. Walk around the neighborhoods around the hotel in all directions because there are charming homes, sites, and great places to eat. I would stay here again. It was also convenient to take the picadilly line from Earls court to heathrow and much cheaper than the express if you have a few in your parties. Overall this hotel was worth it and very convenient. Staff were knowledgeable and willing to find out if they didn't know something."
130,1061,"Jan 2 2007 	Medium size travel inn	Stayed there for 3 night after X'mas. It is a medium size travel inn located at the corner one street (Earls Court Garden) down from Earl's Court Underground. Reception staff are friendly but seems overloaded. Room is ok except toilet is a bit run down. There are supermarkets, restaurants and cafes in main street. Everthing is okay except the dimmed street lights along Earls Court Garden."
131,1061,"Dec 10 2006 	Good Price Great Location.	Was in London from November 29- December 6, 2006 and stayed at the PTI Kensington. Check-in was a breeze and the front desk clerk was very helpful in spite of the fact that they were pretty busy due to the George Michael concert. The hotel was booked solid, but we still managed to get a room on the quiet side of the building. We did not ask to be on the quiet side; it was offered to us by the front desk clerk since we were staying for a week. The room itself was okay - pretty much what you'd expect from a PTI. It was relatively spacious (London standards), it was clean, the bed was comfy, and the shower pressure was good. Had a hairdryer, TV, a desk, and a couch. Best thing about this PTI is its location - very close to Earl's court tube so it was easy to get around; within walking distance to close to High street kensington for shopping; very close to Sainsbury's for groceries; and very close to Earl's court road for takeaway.Having said all this, don't expect anything else. It is a budget hotel, so there are no ice machines, no cable channels, no toiletries, no business centre, etc which you would normally find in other North American chains. Also, there were no drawers in the room, just a small closet to hang your clothes (which only had 6 hangers), so we pretty much lived out of our suitcase (which was not a big deal to us).I used the wifi connection, which was pretty expensive, but I had no choice as I had to send a document by email. I tried to get a pre-paid card from front desk but they had run out of the cheapest one they had. I must commend the front desk clerk's initiative, however, since he had offered to send the email on my behalf using PTI's server so that I would not have to pay the GBP3.00/30 minutes swisscom was charging.All in all, I would stay at this hotel again. I've been to other PTIs all over the UK, and I have never been disappointed. Even though PTIs are pretty much a no-frills hotel chain, their customer service never fails to disappoint, and in my books, that counts for a lot."
132,1061,"Nov 21 2006 	Pretty good little hotel!!!	So we stayed here for 2 nights, the first night when we got to london and the last night before leaving.Our first night, the room was rather small, but very clean and the bathroom was spotless. There were just 2 of us so it wasn't a problem. The bed was comfy and I don't know if if is a british thing but we noticed they don't really use a sheet? we were so tired we didn't bother to ask-but we noticed when we stayed with friends they don't really use sheets except to cover the mattress so this might be normal?The location is fantastic, a 5 minute walk at most from the Earl's court tube station which is pretty close to everything and there are all kinds of restaurants, supermarkets, grocery etc in the area. The area felt very safe as well. The staff were very helpful and the great part is that they have a special luggage room that is locked, so we left our stuff at 10:30am and didn't get it until 6pm (at no charge) as we toured london because we were getting on a train later that night.Bathoom shower pressure was fantastic! and the room area very quiet.On the second night (after being out of london for a week) we were on a different floor and we did notice the room was a little bigger but very clean as well.We never ate at the hotel as we found the prcies expensive.Overall, I would stay at this location again and recommend this location to anyone."
133,1061,"Nov 7 2006 	A Great Price For London	What a great price for London. Our expectations were quite low expecting a very small room, not necessarily clean and far from transport and were quietly surprised to discover our room was quite large (room enough for the king bed and a couch and a travel cot) as well as a decent sized bathroom. Though it doesn't have a fridge it does have a kettle with tea and coffee. The restaurant, located on site, has great food and the service was brilliant. What made this stay even more enjoyable was the fact that Earls Court Station is literally 5 minutes at the end of the street and the supermarket is a 5 minute walk the other way. It is conveniently located to everything. Our only warning is to plan ahead as it does appear to be extremely popular, and even with all the people we didn't much noise from the other guests. Would highly recommend it for the price you pay."
134,1061,"Nov 4 2006	well recommended	Just had a 2 night stay here and found it really comfortable, clean and spacious. It is one of the basic hotels as in there are no drawers to keep your clothes but there is a wardrobe and the bathroom was spotless. (incidentally one review commented that the shower was just a hose, no spray, well so was ours, but you have to twist the shower head, it is one of those heads that give several different sprays) The staff were friendly and helpful and the resturant was bright and clean. The only gripe I had was that the web site for Premier inns states that a continental breakfast is available for 5.50, but this hotel doesn't do continental, only full English. My daughter only eats toast &amp; juice so we were a bit dissapointed, until the resturant manager agreed to let us have continental , but we did feel a bit annoyed. Great location, tube very handy. Well recommended."
135,1061,"Oct 27 2006	Excellent value	Just completed a five day stay. Great location, fine value. But do something about the shower. It is simply a hose no spray. We will definitely stay on our next trip to London."
136,1061,"Oct 25 2006 	Free and fabulous	I selected this hotel as part of a special BA promotional offer. Having stayed at other hotels in the area (booked through Virgin) I expected shabby basic no frills Earls Court accomodation.What I got however was a clean spacious comfortable room with comfy bed, fluffy towels, a lovely hot shower, and a clean tea kettle , fresh milk and a packet of crisp delicious biscuits.And the cost of the room was zero!One simply cannot do better than this. Keep your eye out for any future BA offers and do not hestitate to select this Premier Travel Inn."
137,1061,"Oct 22 2006 	Great value for money	After a fair bit of online research, I booked and stayed at the Premier Travel Inn Kensington for six nights on my recent trip to London (holiday). The hotel is very conveniently located in the Earls Court area, it is a five minutes walk to the Tube station. The Tube is the most convenient way around town and once you figure out the various lines it is quite easy to get to places. The room was spacious and there were nothing to complain about. The bathroom was clean and spacious, the bed was made up everyday and all necessary amenities were provided. If you are a sports freak, you'll have to be at the bar (downstairs) to catch up on the cable channels as the rooms have only the BBC and a few other free-to-air channels. On the whole, I was quite impressed with the hotel on what was a memorable time in London."
138,1061,"Oct 17 2006 	Great Location	hotel is in a great location mins from earls court tube station which runs the picadilly line into all main areas. Clean room, good breakfast. if i was going back to london i would def stay hear again. good value for money"
139,1061,"Oct 3 2006 	A gem!	We booked a family room for a few nights for the bargain rate of 75 a night. The room was small but had enough room for a double bed, single bed, cot and for us to live out of our suitcase and keep the buggy up the whole stay. The room was clean and the bed made and supplies replenished daily. All staff were friendly and very helpful.It was nice to have a bar &amp; restaurant there incase you didn't want to venture too far. We had the breakfast one morning which was very good value for 7.50. Its a buffet and you can choose from fruit, cereal, yoghurt, toast, juices, croissants, bacon, fried egg, scrambled egg, sausages, beans, mushrooms, tomato and coffee. Kids eat free too so it worked out cheaper than another smaller breakfast we'd had nearby.Its in a brilliant location, right round the corner from Earls Court Station but if you walk a bit further you can use Gloucester Road too where there are lots more nice restaurants to choose from. Overall we had a great time there and will definitely return to this hotel!"
140,1061,"Oct 1 2006	A nice find in Earl's Court	Had a great stay at the Premier TI Kensington in late June. The hotel is very close to Earl's Court tube station, no more than a two minute walk along Earl's Court Gardens. The rooms are lovely and big, with a desk, seating area and a reading lamp, in case guests want to have company visit or just sit and read.The bed was comfortable, and I very much liked having extra pillows available (in the cupboard), rather than having to ask at Reception. The shower was powerful, and a very pleasant extra was a nice big bath tub as well - a real treat. Breakfast is optional, but there are a number of places to eat within a ten minute walk of the hotel, so that's not really a minus. The windows open, plus there's air conditioning, for those who find it a must-have. One thing some guests might not care for is that rooms at the rear of the hotel face the District and Circle lines, and the tube train noise may be undesirable for some. Overall, a fine stay at a reasonable price for central London."
141,1061,"Oct 1 2006	Air Conditioned Clean and Quiet	We got our room with a flight + hotel deal thru British Airways. We were pleased to find our room spotless and well air-conditioned. It was cleaned daily and the bed made all three days that we were there. We did request a top sheet after the heavy cover was too much for my husband.  The window panes were double paned and we never heard the train that ran behind the building, or anything else.  There was an excellent &quot;lift&quot; (elevator), in house cash bar, and breakfast served in the dining area, though we were too pressed for time to sit down for breakfast ourselves. A block or two away were a variety of eating establishments. If you need extra toiletries or over the counter meds there is a &quot;chemist&quot; or pharmacy within walking distance, but they close about 7pm. There are small groceries and a health food store in the same area, near Earl's Court Tube Station, where you can pick up some healthfull snacks.  I recommend this hotel to everyone who appreciates comfort and a good night's rest."
142,1061,Sep 28 2006 	Great value for money	My husband and I (early 40's) spent 2 nights at this hotel before our return home. This was our first trip to Europe (London &amp; Paris) and I used tripadvisor for our 3 hotel choices (2 in London &amp; 1 in Paris) and was not disappointed.The Premier Travel Inn was the largest room of the 3 we stayed in and was very quiet and very clean.Great shower! I found it odd that there was just a duvet cover and no top sheet - was a little too warm. Staff was very friendly and helpfull.Very easy access from Earl's Court Station and easy to take the metro from Victoria station if your flying in to/out of Gatwick. Good location.Very good value for the price of the room.
143,1061,"Sep 12 2006 	Lots of positives very few negatives!	Just got back to the good old USA after a 7-night stay at this hotel. The room was part of a package deal with British Airways and we chose the hotel because of the ratings from Tripadvisor. There are many positive things to say. #1 Location. One block from Earl's Court Tube Station, felt very safe walking from station to hotel, even after dark. There is a nice little restaurant across from the station for breakfast each morning, close to ATMs and grocery stores too. #2 Cleanliness. #3 Staff is very polite and friendly - our room was ready for us at 10:30 in the morning after an early landing at Gatwick. #4 Our room was very quiet because it was across the street from the noisy train side and six floors up. #5 Shower pressure and temperature were great - lots of hot water!! #6 Bed was very comfortable - ask for a top sheet as the beds have only the fitted sheet and a duvet. Only a few negatives - we asked for a top sheet and extra towels each day. Sometimes we got them, sometimes not. Also, the front desk never answered calls from the room. Vending machines were out of order most of the time. The room was also very small and there were no drawers to put our clothes in. Overall, for the price we paid, we were very happy there."
144,1061,"Aug 16 2006 	Air conditioning!	My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights in July after coming back from spending a few days in Paris. Prior to going to Paris, we stayed at the Premier Travel Inn at County Hall so we knew we were going to get a no frills but extremely clean and comfortable hotel room and this certainly did not disappoint.Check in was OK but the staff made my day when they were able to get me a non-smoking room, even though there were only smoking rooms available when I booked through Expedia.Once we got to our room, the first thing we noticed was the excellent air conditioning. This is something we did not have at County Hall or in Paris and it felt like heaven. Outside temperatures at the time were around 28-29C so it was nice to come back to a cool room after walking around in the wonderful Earl's Court area. Lots of different types of restaurants (Indian, Japanese, Thai, Filipino, Chinese just to name a few) and pubs around. There were internet cafes offering cheap unlimited access. There are many other hotels in the area so there are lots of tourists walking the streets in the evening. The Earl's Court tube station is just minutes away.Very good value for the money."
145,1061,"Aug 14 2006 	Best of All	Out of the three three hotels we stayed in during our London vacation, this was by far the best. The price is amazing considering what we paid for some incredible dumps. It is close to the tube, restaurants, shops. It was clean, attractive, comfortable, quiet, and had air conditioning! The staff was very helpful. The morning breakfast was excellent--everybody was hard at work. Don't take a chance on other places. This one won't disappoint."
146,1061,"Aug 9 2006 	Brillant Hotel everything only a tube ride away!	Just arrived back after a 5 night stay at this hotel. The hotel was very clean maid service every day, always left plenty tea, coffee and milk. The location is brillant it's so near to everything, you come out of the hotel turn right walk along earls court gardens road and you are the tube station. If you didn't want to eat in the hotel, breakfast was 7.50 each which is quite a lot for 3 people over 5 days, there is plenty places to eat round about the tube station and there is also a bakers and a somerfields. We had a room at the back of the hotel and the noise from the trains was not to bad and we were on the fifth floor. The only thing I would say about the room is that there is no drawers and not enough hangers if there is more than one person in the room. Overall I thought the room was excellent and would highly recommend it and would say there again."
147,1061,"Jul 2 2006	Great value hotel cheap good location	Searched quite a number of hotels before choosing this one.We were only in London 2 days for the Eagles concert and didn't want anythinng too pricey. Having stayed at Premier travel inn before i knew what to expect.Location was good, 5 minutes walk from Earls Court tube station.The room was spacious, tidy and had air con which was a major plus considering the heat wave the weekend we went. Having stayed in other London hotels that don't have air con- this was a god send as rooms can get quite cooped up.The only negative thing i would say about our stay is we turned up at 1.30pm, half hour before check in and we weren't able to get a room. 5 minutes later, another couple checked in after us and the woman who served them gave them a room."
148,1061,"Jun 7 2006	GREAT hotel just what London needs	This is the kind of hotel that London has needed for decades! For the price, this place was AMAZING. Very clean; friendly staff; nice restaurant downstairs. Amazing location - 1 block from Earl's Court tube station; close to post office, supermarket, bakery, deli's, pubs, restaurants, internet cafes. Very efficient check-in and check-out.Only small things that needed improvement: no room safe, no refrigerator, and no drawers! There were only six hangers in the closet, which meant I couldn't unpack my stuff and had to live out of my suitcase. If you choose to stay here, I suggest sending them an email beforehand to request extra hangers in the room.Apart from that, nothing but praise for this place."
149,1061,"Mar 30 2006	great location	Just back from a family week-end break &amp; we were very pleased with this economy hotel .The rooms were clean, warm &amp; very quiet (make sure you ask for this as some rooms overlook the railway line).The location was great for visiting the museums &amp; Earls Court.Tube station only 3 minutes walk.we were also pleased with very friendly &amp; effecient staff."

1,1062,"Nov 1 2009 	Perfect hotel and staff	We stayed here with our 5 year old. From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, friendly and very helpful. Yes we had to use the self service check in but the lovely lady on reception actually did most of it for us. The room was at the back of the hotel so quiet enough. The whole hotel was spotless. Bed comfy and air conditioning in the room very welcome.Plenty of choice at breakfast. The restaurant isn't huge but tables became free often enough that no one was waiting for more than 5 minutes for one."
2,1062,"Oct 29 2009 	Excellent value for money	Good location, cheap, clean and spacious room, helpfull staff.The hotel is situated just 5 min walk from the Earls Cort Tube station. It is easy to get arround in London from this station.The rooms were clean and very spacious compared to other London hotels. God beds and a little flatscreen tv in the room made it even better.The only thing i have to complain about is the breakfast.Very little breakfast room, had to wait for a table. The food was ok, but i missed some cheese, ham, boiled eggs etc instead of just the traditional English breakfast.But other then that it was excellent!"
3,1062,Oct 29 2009 	Excellent value for money	We paid 49GBP per night for three nights booking via the Premier Inn website specials.For this price we got a clean and comfortable room and bathroom. A handy location for the tube and high street with a few decent pubs and restaurants. All of this in London!The staff are friendly and helpful but very insistent on ensuring guests use the self serve check in system. The buffet breakfast was very good (an additional 8GBP per person).In summary this hotel was excellent value for money and we would stay here again.
4,1062,"Oct 25 2009 	Couldn't have been better	Just got back from a quick trip. Stopped here for 2 nights for under 100. Staff very friendly and helpful, Room spotless. Usually a Travelodge visitor but I think I'm converted.This is a great hotel, close to the tube, a few pubs, restaurants and takeaways to choose from,Quiet, comfy, squeaky clean, air conditioned room and I still can't get over how nice the staff were.Congratulations Premier Inn, you have some very happy customers."
5,1062,"Oct 25 2009 	Great value	The staff here are delightful and can't do enough for you. They all seemed so cheerful although very busy. Room very clean as were the facilities. Super, convenient location. We had a great deal for two nights."
6,1062,"Oct 19 2009 	all you need when traveling with family	Once again, i got a good offer from premierinn.com website and we stayed this time 3 nights Kensington Olympia with a price of 49 GBP/night for a family room (4 persons). Not bad.Premier Inn's concept seems to be to provide the very basics: comfortable rooms with no extra, so you will not find folded toilet papers, vanity kits etc. from your room. However, this was enough for traveling with family and would be ok for me also if i was travelling in business. We had very spacious room with 4 full-sized beds, flat-screen TV, coffee making facilities and bathroom. Hotel is refurbished recently and it appeared to be very clean. Staff was very helpful and having kids with us was absolutely no problem. Cromwell Road is very busy and the noise problem is tackled with extra sliding glass in front of the windows (see the picture). Very efficient airconditioning will be a good plus in warm seasons (as you can not open the window). Both the main entrance and elevators open with a card-key so I felt the place was also secureThis property is located along major road in west Kensington area with convenient access (5 minutes walk) to underground station and 2 minutes walk to nearest bus stops with service to kensington area attractions(Victoria and Albert museum, natural History Museum, Hyde Park and kensington gardens, Harrod's etc.). Really good experience and I would definetely stay here again when i visit London.Pros:-Price/quality-Clean-30 minutes from Heathrow airport by underground-Good restaurants and grocery stores nearby-Kids eat free breakfast (7.99 for adults)-Efficient self service check-in Cons:-Morning traffic might wake you up if you prefer to sleep late-No iron/board, safe, minibar in the room-Building is old and floor is making some noise"
7,1062,Oct 9 2009 	A great hotel for the price in London	This hotel is close to the Earls Court Tube stop and on the Picadilly line which goes directly to Heathrow. We thought the hotel was an excellent bargain and very nice. The staff was particularly very pleasant and so helpful.
8,1062,"Oct 3 2009 	Good location for olympia and earls court.	Good for what it is, ideal for business trip withing this area. Rooms were ok and very clean."
9,1062,"Oct 1 2009 	Disappointed with head office	We have been using Premier (Travel) Inns since they first appeared on the scene and have always been satisfied until recently.On a recent family vacation throughout the UK, we once again stayed at many Premier Inns often booking three rooms per night. I booked my son and his fiance into the new London, Kensington location for three nights.When we all got home he told me of items going missing from their luggage in the room. The cost of the items is not important but the thought that staff would be snooping through luggage and taking things is.I wrote to head office several weeks ago explaining the situation and received a standard form letter back saying I would hear from them within fourteen days. To date I am still waiting. I expect more from Premier Inns and the head office in particular. Is this the new standard for them?"
10,1062,"Sep 25 2009 	Great hotel if you just want the basics	My wife and I stayed here for a week in September 2009 along with out four month old twins. We had spent a lot of time on TripAdvisor searching for relatively cheap hotels that had good reviews and most of the Premier Travel Inns came near the top of the lists. We chose this one because it was fairly central, close to a tube station, had it's own restaurant and we knew that it would be of a good standard. The price was expensive compared to Premier Travel Inns elsewhere but compared to London it was pretty cheap.The hotel is situated on a main road but noise wasn't a problem, it was only five minutes walk from Earl's Court tube station. We had a double pram with us which meant we appreciated the disabled access throughout the hotel, although in practice it was quicker to lift the pram up and down the few steps.All the staff were very helpful and friendly (having babies, especially having two seems to help here!). The family room we had booked was spotlessly clean and very spacious. OK, it wasn't luxurious but you know what to expect from a chain hotel like this and it was exactly what we needed.The breakfasts (which you have to pay extra for) were fantastic. Eat as much as you like from a choice of cereals, fruit, cooked breakfast, pastries. We were expecting to have to eat in their restaurant in the evenings due to having to get our babies to bed early but it turned out that we didn't eat there at all. We went to some of the (many) local restaurants, fed the babies while we looked at the menus, then they went to sleep in the pram leaving us to have a leisurely meal. I would recommend Orjowan, a Lebanese restaurant just off Earls Court Road.Overall we couldn't have been happier with this hotel."
11,1062,Sep 13 2009	Excellent Value for Money	I recently stayed at the Premier Inn for four days with my Mother and sister. Unfortunately we had to visit London for a family bereavement and booked this hotel as it was the only place we could stay for 4 consecutive nights from Friday to Tuesday. The rooms were very comfortable. My sister and myself shared a twin room which had a large double and a single bed. The first night we were at the front of the hotel and although the traffic noise didn't bother me my sister didn't sleep very well. We asked to be moved the next morning to the back of the hotel and it was much quieter. We ended up with an even bigger room so we were very happy.My mother's double room wasn't very large but she found it quite comfortable and it was also situated at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden area.We ate in the hotel for three of our four nights and the food was excellent. A good selection and reasonable portions. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the Earls Court Road which is a ten minute walk from the hotel. There is also a large Tesco a 5 minute walk away in the other direction which is open 24 hours.The staff were very pleasant indeed and we must make special mention of Swati and Amy who were particularly helpful and kind.Two very minor gripes were the service in the restaurant on the Monday evening which was very slow - there appeared to be only one girl who was serving in the bar and the restaurant so our order took a long time to arrive. Also in our second room part of the wooden frame came away from the door so we couldn't put our chain on at night. However it was still possible to lock the door so it wasn't a major problem but as the hotel had recently been refurbished this was a bit of a surprise!!However overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends - but if you are sensitive to noise then remember to ask for a room on the top floor at the back of the hotel !!
12,1062,"Sep 8 2009 	ottima sistemazione	spacious room, clean and very new! also location perfect close to earl's court tube station.i'll come back.Roberto"
13,1062,"Sep 8 2009 	Fine for the purpose	I stayed here for one night before a business meeting the next day. I know London well - lived there for over 30 years - and decided it was a convenient area to stay in to get to South Ken museums, near OK restuarants etc.Check in was fine - the receptionist took my printed confirmation and put in the details for me so I just had to check that it was all OK &amp; pay. I had a comfortable quiet room - bigger than I expected, with large bathroom including a bath. Breakfast was rather overpriced for what was on offer - it was OK but nothing special and the room was quite small, though plenty of room when I was there. All staff were friendly and helpful."
14,1062,"Sep 5 2009 	Ideal location for visiting Kensington area	I recently stayed overnight with my husband and 8 year old son. Location was ideal for Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park which is a lovely 20 min walk away via Kensington High Street. Earls Court Station is a 5-10 min walk or the No 74 Bus takes you towards Natural History Museum/Harrods.On arrival our room was ready (we arrived at 12.00pm, taxi was 12 from Victoria) Unlike previous Premier Inns you have to use the touch screen computer to check yourselves in. The receptionist was helpful and talked us through it. You are then issued your receipt and room cards. We had a family room in the basement, not a good view but it was only one night and we only slept in there. Bathroom was clean but small. Storage space was adequate for one night. Beds as usual were extremely comfy. Breakfast was 7.95 and kids eat free. It is buffet and there was plenty of choice, though it could be crowded at times as area is small, plus they kept running out of cups. Young lad on Breakfast duty worked extremely hard and was very pleasant. We waited only 5 mins to be seated but the queues were growing when we had finished our breakfast which was about 9.30am.This was our second trip to London and I chose this Hotel because of it's location to Kensington, an area we didn't cover on our first visit."
15,1062,"Sep 3 2009 	Good deal for London standard!	First time visiting London and stayed for 4 nights, and this hotel definitely didn't disappoint. Located around 10 mins from the Earl's Court tube station which was at the edge of zone 1 and around 30 mins to get to city centre. There were lots of restaurants and stores around the station so it was at a convenient and safe location. Stayed in a twin room and the room was neat and clean, though there was one double bed and one single bed for the twin room. Got breakfast for 2 mornings and in my opinion it was a bit overpriced. The breakfast was all you can eat and was alright and there are different selections, but one can definitely find similar quality food near the station for around half the price. In room wifi was experience but there was a McDonald's near the station which offered free wifi. Overall a good experience at the hotel ad would recommend to anyone visiting London."
16,1062,"Aug 24 2009 	a really good hotel	we visited London for the weekend with our 4 year old, wanted a hotel near to the museums and this was prefect. Have stayed in many top London hotels before and this was up with them! Great service; check in was easy, staff very friendly and room was large enough for the three of us. Food was excellent and location meant a 10/15 minute walk to the National History/Science Museums. Would definately go back, great little find"
17,1062,"Aug 12 2009 	Wonderful staff excellent accomodation for families	Stayed for 3 nights with our 2 daughters, 10 and 12 yrs old. We were greeted by a friendly and helpful member of staff. We were able to book in 2 hours before the normal 2pm booking in because the room was ready. This was very much appreciated has we had started out early that morning and the girls were tired. The room was large anough for the 4 of us. The girls beds were full size singles which makes a change to having a mattress slung on the floor which has been our experience with other family rooms in other hotel chains.I understand the place has recently been refurbished so we found everything well maintained and clean.Over the weekend we met a large number of staff and each and everyone of them couldnt have been more helpful and they are a credit to the Premier Inn.The breakfast is good value at 7.95 for a self service buffet with a selection of hot and cold breakfast options. Costa coffee on tap which was an added bonus! For each paying adult a child eats free which means the family had a substantial breakfast for just over 3.00 each - bargain.The hotel is situated on Cromwell Road and about 5-10 minute walk from Earls Court underground and plenty of nearby bus stops which makes getting around the sights of London very easy. It is a 10-15 minute walk from Olympia and has a number of good restaurants nearby.Highly recommended and will be visiting again in December."
18,1062,"Aug 8 2009 	Excellent choice for family	We stayed with two boys, 11 &amp; 13 and they both had single beds in a good sized, clean room. Good location for family, you can walk to Natural History / Science museum and V&amp;A. It is also close to Earls Court tube station and plenty of eating places.Very friendly and helpful staff."
19,1062,"Aug 6 2009 	Good place to stay but spoilt by unhelpfulness of some staff	We stayed here for 1 night (August 5th) as we had a dinner engagement in Central London and a business meeting the next morning nearby. I had booked the room online on the Premier Inn website. When I got off the Tube at Earl's Court to look at my reservation confirmation to see the address I found that although the email said &quot;see below for address &amp; map&quot;, there was no address or map printed on it, nor hotel telephone number, which really are the things you need on a hotel confirmation! I had to stand in the street for about 10 minutes trying to get online with my mobile phone to find the hotel website and work out the route.We arrived at the hotel pretty sweaty and tired out after our 2-hour struggle across London tube/train system to get to Kensington and when we walked in through the door we were greeted by 2 very friendly reception staff who asked us if we'd come to check in. We said yes and the reception guy said that we had to check in on the self-service computer check-in. This involved rummaging in our bags to find our booking reference number, typing this into the machine - the letter &quot;O&quot; on the touchscreen keyboard didn't work very well so we ended up typing in RBSN so of course it couldn't find our reservation. During the whole process the reception guy was just standing watching us. I asked that, since he was actually there, could he just check us in himself rather than watching us doing it? But apparently the answer was no, he couldn't. Note to Premier Inn management: Why have a receptionist at all if they can't check us in? Anyway, we finally got the machine to accept our entry and it duly dispensed paperwork and 2 room keys (my husband was impressed with that bit!).The hotel has a nice bar on the ground floor and after we had taken our bags upstairs we came down again for a nice cool drink to cool down. The barman (same guy who had checked us in) was very friendly and helpful.Later, we went out for dinner, and came back about 12:30am. At this point there were 3 staff on reception. The bar was closed so my husband and I went to the vending machine in the lobby to get some bottled water to take up to our rooms for the night. After we'd put our money in, and our bottle didn't come out, once of the receptionists came to tell us the machine was broken, so we couldn't get anything from it. I asked if we could get 2 bottles of water from the bar, to take up to our room, but no, &quot;the bar is closed now&quot; she said. I asked if it was possible for her just to get us 2 bottles of water, we didn't want any alcoholic drinks, it was purely that we wanted water for our room because the vending machine didn't work. Again the reply was a blunt &quot;No.&quot; Hang on a minute - so you're saying we can't have any water in our room overnight? It had been 27 degrees in London that day and we thought it was likely to be warm in our room if they turned the a/c off at night. Then she said that if I wanted water, I could go to Tesco's up the road to buy some. Bear in mind it is just after midnight - do I really want to be walking the streets of Kensington at that time of night? I asked if one of the members of staff could go and get some water as they weren't able to supply it from the hotel - again the answer was no. Never an apology, never any offer to help in any way, just no. They did finally say that the water in the bathroom taps was drinkable - which may well be true, and is actually what I ended up doing, but how ridiculous that a hotel in London cannot provide its guests with simple mineral water on one of the warmest nights in recent weeks, without any hint of apology. As we turned to go to the lift to go upstairs, one of the guys in reception said &quot;thank you for being such great guests&quot;, which I have to say riled us quite a bit. However, we went to bed, where, as suspected, although we went to bed with the a/c on, I woke up at 3am boiling alive and the a/c was off. Sipping warm hotel bathroom tap water was not a consolation to me. Another note to Premier Inn management: If something goes wrong in your hotel and you can't supply a basic service, try to do something about it rather than just keep saying &quot;No, I can't help you.&quot;All in all, this spoilt our stay, as the rest of the hotel was fine, the other staff were all helpful and friendly, the breakfast was good (although it cost extra), and I would have otherwise said it was excellent value for money. Just make sure if you stay there that you get some water from Tesco's beforehand!"
20,1062,"Jul 21 2009 	Clean Convenient Quiet Comfortable for family. Very nice staff	We traveled with 2 little kids - 6 and 4, and enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The tube station is close by, so are shops and few restaurants. Nice neighborhood to walk around, and pretty central to get around the city. Beds were very comfortable. Kids had pull out bed, and was comfortable for them. Restrooms very clean and shower was great.A small refrigerator/microwave would have been nice, but that is just about the only things that we could complain about. Would certainly recommend to friends!"
21,1062,"Jul 19 2009 	Clean rooms excellant staff convenient location	Stayed 4 days when visiting London in June 2009. Had a family room that had comfortably sleeps 2 adults, 2 kids. Room was very basic, but was clean, comfortable and quiet. Staff was very friendly and helped with whatever request we made.Location is convenient since it is walking distance from Earl's court underground stationand all the restaurants on Earl's court road. Access to bus service is also very convenient. If you are staying here with small children, take them to Holland park playarea; My kids loved it."
22,1062,"Jul 19 2009 	Great Quality for the Price	LOCATIONBasically on the corner of Cromwell and Earls Court, this hotel is approximately 7 minutes from Earls Court Metro, and very close to the museums. The area itself is a little shady, but we found it safe enough to wander around after dark. Taking the tube, we were 25 minutes from the Soho district. One night (2am) we tried to order pizza, but the concierge informed us that no nearby pizza places were open!ROOMSI believe we got the handicap room. The washroom was extra large with all the facilities at a lower height than average. The room was spacious, clean and everything was functional, including the air-conditioning. Oddly enough though, there was no clock in the room so we had to rely on our cellphones. Maid service was lacking. They provided new towels, but on two occasions missed our dirty mugs.HOTELThe check-in process was easy and there was always someone at concierge to assist. The lobby had a coffee bar and a restaurant  we tried neither, but they seemed nice.COCLUSIONThis is a great hotel for the price and I would definitely stay here again."
23,1062,"Jul 17 2009 	Great service	I stay in Premier Inns or similar fairly regularly for work but I was very impressed with the service I recieved at this particular hotel. The lady on the check in desk was very helpful, polite and could not do enough to ensure I had everyhting I needed. The room was good - I find that Premier Inns are always clean, modern and have good facilities anyway. The thing that made this stand out was the great customer service which is rare at a budget hotel chain. Thanks!"
24,1062,"Jul 16 2009 	Good Hotel Location ok	Stayed in this hotel for 1 night while in London. 5 people (2 adults 3 children age 13, 11, 7) had to get 2 rooms, but felt we could have dealt with 1. Unfortunately not many hotels in England allow for more than 4 people in a room. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We arrived a little earlier than normal check in but were able to get at least 1 of our rooms easily. The other was available shortly after and they were right beside each other.The staff was helpful in check in etc, but when I asked about the area, I was given some very basic miss information. The closest Tube Station is Earls Court, but the hotel advised a different one, which (in our walking around the area) we discovered was not the closest. There is little to know shopping in the area, some, but not much, but again we were not given correct information about this either, as we learned on our taxi trip back to the train station. if you are looking for a place to stay close to traditional London site seeing areas, this is not the place. However, we did more of our site seeing via London Black cabs, which actually made it worth it."
25,1062,"Jul 13 2009 	Comfortable clean close enough to Tube	Was booked at Premier Inn London Kensington but was brought by the taxi to Premier Inn Olympia. Turned out OK since Olympia was just newly renovated and clean. Newer but slightly farther than Premier London Kensington. The place itself is quiet but it is only 10 min (leisurely walk) to Earls Court Station, which has lots of restaurants &amp; internet cafes nearby. (Hotel internet more expensive.) Also has access to good buses going to town.No major complaints. The place is simple but clean and comfortable. Good enough for the price (by London standards).Note that breakfast is the same everyday - so perhaps just get it for the first day. Cheaper and more varied options outside (near Earls Court station)."
26,1062,"May 28 2009 	Must get up early in this hotel or your room will not be cleaned!	I stayed at the hotel from 4 May to 6 May! On the morning of 5 May, the housekeeping staff entered my room at sround 12 noon when I was still sleeping! I had a NO DISTURBANCE sign hanging outside! I went out at around 1pm removing the NO DISTURBANCE sign! I return at around 10 pm only to find my room NOT cleaned up! The hotel staff then told me there would be no housekeeping after 4 pm! But I told her there was ample time for them to clean my room! I think this is totally unacceptable! I did not pursue further because I would be leaving the next morning and I was very tired then! After I return to Hong Kong, I send them a complaint letter! However, I am still wating for their response!"
27,1062,"May 28 2009 	Absolutely fantastic	Booked Premier Inn Kensington originally upon reading the good reviews. Changed to this one at Olympia after learning the other one is undergoing renovations.I can't fault anything about this hotel. The family room with double bed and sofa bed is spacious (a big relief after reading reviews about other London hotels with small rooms), modern and clean. Bathroom is big and shower pressure is strong. Staff are friendly and eager to help. All you can eat breakfast is great value as my daughter eats free (probably a tag expensive for travellers with no children).I don't normally write reviews but felt compelled to do so as we enjoyed our stay so much."
28,1062,"Apr 22 2009 	A gem - great value good sized family room spotless good location!	Hotel is recently refurbished - so everything brand new and spotlessly clean. Family room (large very comfortable double bed, sofa bed and fold bed) was larger than expected for a London room. Tea/Coffee making facilties a welcome bonus. Stayed for 2 nights, so did not have much luggage, but wardrobe space seemed adequate. Bathroom spotless and good towels, soap/shower gel dispenser on walls. Location is excellent - just over 5 mins from Earls Court Tube Station and about 10 mins from Kensington High Street. Pleny of restaurants nearby both on Earls Court Road and Kensington. Plenty of choice for breakfast - cereals, breads, toast and cooked breakfast. Kids loved the muffins and also great costa coffee! Staff friendly and helpful. Could not find a single fault with stay - I have stayed in many 4 star hotels at a much higher price and certainly felt that this hotel in its current newly refurbished state offers much better value than most other 3 or 4 star hotels in this area."
29,1062,"Apr 15 2009 	Fantastic value for money	I stayed there for Easter with my wife and 2 children.The hotel have been refurbished in february so it is completely new, and you immediately see it.The staff is really friendly and ready to help you anytime. Always with smile...very nice.Room was large enough for us, very clean.The breakfast was very good, surely something to enjoy.Finally the location: just 10 minutes walk from Earl's Court station on the Piccadilly line that connects you to central London and to Heathrow. Many restaurants in the area: I recommend to try Kensington Arms, very close to the hotel, nice and modern inside, friendly staff and good food.A fantastic stay!"
30,1062,"Mar 27 2009 	Good value for London but very small double room	The bottom line is that we would stay in a Premier Inn again and this Premier Inn again, but only for a day or two. We stayed for 7 nights and this was too long for such the double room, even with the understanding that London rooms are small in general (think Manhattan).This was our first time in a Premier Inn and this review is from an American perspective - but we have travelled in Europe numerous times.Cons: Double room really sleeps two, but sits one. There is one chair and if you'd like to relax in your room after being on your feet all day, one of you will have to sit on the bed. The one chair can be angled to see the TV. (Sorry we didn't bring the camera.) Next time we shop for a London hotel room we will more carefully analyse the square footage (and ceilings were low). We brought our own shampoo, conditioner and soap since it's a foam dispenser at the sink and a dispenser in the bath/shower. Hairdryer is next to the tea kettle, so glad to have it but wierd drying your hair in the room rather than the bathroom. The bed for OK, but no fitted sheet so the bottom sheet slides around a bit and the bed is on rollers, so it will move if you bump it. Single duvet with sheet covering (seems to be all the rage everywhere) is not helpful to us as we get too hot under a duvet. We were able to control the temperature in the room, but would have preferred sheet and blanket. Walls are thin and you can hear very well between rooms. Other guests were not loud and it was quiet for sleeping, but not very private feeling. The neighborhood is pretty busy so while it was fine for tube, eating out, safety, it was not charming for walking around, busy traffic in nearby streets. TV channels from a US perspective were fine but we would consider it more like over the air than cable, FYI.Pros: Bathroom for fine sized with tub and shower and decent sized towels. Clean, value priced room and service was helpful and kind. Internet in lobby was 3 pounds for an hour (on sale apparently) and convenient. LIghts on each side of the bed for reading where excellent. Neighborhood is terrific for cheaper to medium priced and delicious meals and a couple of pubs nearby (masala zone, nandos, GBK etc). You have to cross a couple of busy streets to get to the main drag near Earl's Court but it was fine if you don't have a couple of small children in tow, and nice to be staying a little away from the main drag. Housekeeping was great, changing sheets occasionally without us begging for it (also seems to be the rage these days). Single window, but it opened for fresh air and didn't face a wall or anything. So again, we would definitely stay again and would recommend this to anyone for a day or two. If you need to stay longer, stay if this is the only way you can afford it, but we'd pay a little extra for more space (maybe get the bigger room here, but I didn't get the impression it was much bigger)."
31,1062,"Mar 2 2009 	Perfect Premier Inn	I have used Premier Inn in Belfast and Manchester and been really impressed with their quality, service and value for money. However I was anxious about using this hotel as it has just opened (last week) and there were no reviews available. I needn't have worried though because the hotel has been completely refurbished and the same standards as I'd experienced before applied. The Premier Inn London Kensington Olympia was extremely modern, clean and bright and as always the staff were really friendly and helpful, in particular Amy. The location of this hotel (formerly a Comfort Inn) was perfect for us being just a 5/7 minute walk from Earls Court tube station where we caught the Piccadilly line to Heathrow. The walk to the hotel took us along two main roads which were busy and very safe. We went into Convent Garden at night for dinner but there was actually a great choice of restaurants and bars very close to the hotel.The purpose of my trip was to take my son to see Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and the hotel was perfect as the ground was only two stops away on the tube. All in all we had a great time and I would thoroughly recommend this new addition to the Premier Inn Chain."

1,1064,Nov 16 2009 	clean good location 	i stayed in this hotel because i had to catch an early train ride to paris the next morning. i stayed for only a night. the rooms were clean and nice - but a little bare. location was great (for my purpose) and it was excellent value for money. food and necessities were also easiliy available as this hotel was located in a pretty busy corner. the staff were also very friendly - one helped me book a trip to stonehenge.
2,1064,"Oct 29 2009 	Good value	We wanted a modest hotel in walking distance of St Pancras and booked the Premier Inn because of the recommendations. It lived upto its recommendation: friendly, clean, efficient. The breakfast was generous and well-organised - even at 9:30 they were replenishing the croissants.One gripe: the pricing policy means that you have to pay for every &quot;extra&quot;, for instance WLAN and the use of a safe in the room. WLAN should be regarded as a basic service these days. Here it was expensive (5 GBP for an hour) and you have the hassle of logging in with a credit card. Use of the safe cost 1.50 GBP.Despite this, fit for purpose and highly recommended."
3,1064,"Oct 22 2009 	Much worse than expected.	We booked this hotel as we were arriving quite late at Pancras and leaving the next morning for Heathrow. A no-frills room next to Pancras seemed ideal.We were given a room on the ground floor, facing an alley leading to the street. The room was clean but a bit on the miserable side. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Still, it's a cheap room, so up until 5:00am everything was acceptable.At that time, however, a loud whining noise started. Exhausted after travelling and desperately needing more than four hours sleep before resuming travel, I staggered down to the front desk. They were very apologetic and blamed &quot;the plant,&quot; and scurried about as if to fix something, but the noise never ceased. Rather, it was joined a bit later by loud mechanical noises coming from either the street or the alley, accompanied by periodic bangs as the fire door in the hallway outside our room was opened and closed.They wound up giving us the room for free, but I would have much rather have had a bit less money and a lot more sleep."
4,1064,"Oct 20 2009 	great location	just recently stayed at the Premier Inn Kings Cross.Cannot fault this hotel in any way.Arrived early so could not check in at the time, but staff took our luggage and secured it in a locked room for when we could check in.check in was a breeze, no more than 3 minutes to confirm everything and get our keys authorisedRoom was bright, very large queen size bed and two (very comfy) matresses on the floor for our grand-kids. We were expecting a room with a bed settee, but the kids much preferred this. Despite the matresses on the floor there was still plenty roomAircon worked well and heard very little noise from the street, even though we were on the first floor. we were on the side street, I think the main road would be a different caseGreat value menus in both breakfast and evening meals in the hotel.All staff smiled and spoke to you as you went past them. Staff in the restaurant deserve special praise as they welcomed us all in making sure the children were given that &quot;you're special&quot; treatment..Checking out was as easy as it was checking in and again they took our luggage for the day and we had a late return home train journey"
5,1064,"Oct 18 2009 	Great location and value for one night stay	We needed a hotel near Kings Cross St. Pancras station to board the Eurostar early in the morning. In fact, I had booked another B&amp;B but found that with tube closures and work, we would not be able to catch the first train to Paris. I changed to this hotel at the last minute. I didn't have great expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Not big rooms but very clean and a huge, very comfortable bed with great linens on it. I loved the fact that all the checking in was done through a vending machine! I could have done it with the lobby desk but is was a kick to do it the new way. This hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the station. They will let you store your bags there if you are returning. I wanted to have the experience of an old Georgian building so I was going on to a B&amp; B after Paris. No matter though, the Eurostar station in Paris has very secure lockers for baggage. Great for one night."
6,1064,"Oct 12 2009 	Best night's sleep I have had in London	I stayed for a night in this hotel on a business trip. The hotel was as to be expected from a Premier Inn, with standard fixtures and fittings in room and bathroom. Flat screen TV with Freeview wasn't working when I arrived, within 10 minutes a new remote was delivered solving the problem. The breakfast was amazing, lots of choice and excellent service.But the very best bit was how quiet it was for a central London hotel, probably because all windows face into an inner courtyard rather than onto the road. If I was staying in this part of London again, I would definately choose this hotel."
7,1064,"Oct 12 2009 	Excellent value for family travel	We have two teenagers which can make accomodations in Europe expensive where unlike the US it is difficult to find a room that can sleep four. We chose Premier Inn because of the good reviews, price, the fact that they offered &quot;family rooms&quot; and it's location next to King's Cross Station. The room was small but very clean, modern, comfortable, quiet, had a deluxe feel and slept all four of us. We purchased two adult breakfast buffet tickets which allowed us to feed the kids for free. Highly recommend this as it was a complete breakfast--many choices for everyone. Only drawback: we like to eat dinner in local eateries but there was very little within walking distance of the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. They allowed us to leave our bags in their secure bag check area for a day of sightseeing at no charge. I will definitely look to Premier Inn next time I travel to London."
8,1064,"Oct 11 2009 	Convenient base camp to explore London	The hotel is basically similar to an American Hampton Inn or Comfort Inn . The rooms are quiet, clean and comfortable. There is certainly no view from the rooms. The WiFi is not free. The main reason for staying here is price and convenience. This hotel is conveniently located right next to the King's Cross and St. Pancras rail stations, a major transportation hub bringing together the Tube, buses, domestic rail and the Eurostar (to Paris). The Piccadilly tube line runs straight from Heathrow to King's Cross, a decent 45 minute ride. A dozen bus lines run out from here across the city. The area has lots of fast food around including McDonalds, Starbucks, KFC, etc. There are more in St. Pancras station. I particularly had a good meal from the Chop Chop asian restaurant on Euston Road; it also has take-away. Just behind the hotel is a TESCO market. There is also a small market/fruit stand/Post Office on Euston.As for local sights, the British Library is a couple of blocks away and it has a fantastic, free gallery of historical artifacts ranging from an original copies of the Magna Carta, the Gutenberg Bible, a First Folio of Shakespeare's works, the original hand written and illustrated manuscript of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, and original hand written lyrics from the Beatles."
9,1064,"Oct 7 2009 	Great hotel for a weekend break	I stayed at this hotel for three nights during a weekend break to London with a friend. The hotel is very close to Kings Cross mainline and tube stations so you can quickly reach central London. The staff were helpful and friendly as soon as we entered the hotel, all the members of staff we encountered during our stay provided good service in a friendly manner and offered advice about how to get to certain attractions in the city. The room was quite small (but I would expect that in London) but was clean and had all we needed. Our room did overlook the lobby which I was concerned about due to other reviews I had read which said this made the room noisy (we were on the second floor). The noise was not a problem with the window shut and one night we left the window open and both of us still managed to sleep perfectly well so the noise wasn't really a problem.We ate in the restaurant one evening and we were treated with the same courtesy as we had experienced in reception and we had an enjoyable meal.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London and particularly to anyone who needs to be near to the station."
10,1064,"Oct 3 2009 	Great budget hotel...if you're not too tall	This is a clean and efficient (read = small but adequate) hotel with very clean rooms. It is very near Kings Cross station in London which is a constantly busy area but the room we had was one of the most quiet hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. The shower was elevated off the floor and I was not able to stand up in it, and the king sized bed (called a &quot;double&quot; in Europe) didn't seem to be as long as the US version. I'm 6'9&quot; so most people should be fine."
11,1064,"Sep 25 2009 	Great hotel	At the beginning of my trip I stayed at another hotel in the area, which turned out to be horrendous. I ended up cancelling my reservation for the end of my trip and stayed at the Premier Inn instead. They were so helpful and made my stay very enjoyable. Would definately stay there again. Right across from Kings cross and St. Pancras stations so it is easy to get anywhere you want in London easily."
12,1064,"Sep 24 2009 	Convenient	Very handy for St Pancras (early morning departure), hotel is good Premier Inn quality, very pleasant. The only bad thing was the price 120 - it's London I am told but that doesn't make it any better"
13,1064,"Sep 20 2009 	A nice surprise	Just three minutes walk from King's Cross train and tuve station and St. Pancras' station, Premier Inn is a lovely faultless hotel: free internet, cable TV, kind staff, gorgeous breakfast, quiet, comfortable, clean... what more can I say? Go for it. Modern style."
14,1064,"Sep 17 2009 	good hotel  Kings Cross station	Hotel was on a side street close to the station , it has a nice lobby and bar area . We found all the staff to be polite and helpful when we needed anything , they let us check in very early because of our early train arrival . The rooms are typical of others in the prem inn chain clean and functional ."
15,1064,"Sep 17 2009 	Great hotel near St Pancras	We spent 3 nights here in August, mainly as we were leaving on the Eurostar and wanted to be close to the station. The hotel hasn't got many attractions close by but is great for the Eurostar and underground station. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We had dinner in the restaurant one night and the food was very nice. We paid for 'breakfast included' and it was well worth it. Lots to choose from including cereals, yoghurts, muffins etc as well as hot choices and it was all you could eat. Our room was great with a very comfortable bed and everything was clean and fresh. The price was good too. I would certainly stay here again, it was great value for money."
16,1064,"Sep 16 2009 	Practical and nice	Very practical - good location (3 min from tube and rail), fine breakfast, fast check-in, reasonable price (for London).The room was a bit small for 4, the children slept on low roll-out beds.Clean room, looking quite new. Was surprised to pay extra for the safe deposit box in the room.The wireless Internet is not cheap.A good surprise for a London hotel."
17,1064,"Sep 13 2009 	Great Hotel for a Great Trip in London	My cousin and I stayed at this hotel for four days prior to our Contiki tour of Great Britain. I had read good things on trip advisor and the value was comparable to other hotels which had poorer ratings in and around the same area, so I decided it was a good deal.We had no trouble arriving from Heathrow and getting to the hotel location. If you are coming from the tube, you exit at Kings Cross station and can easily walk to the hotel in minutes with your luggage. It's a great location for sightseeing since it is so close to the tube and national rail stations, and there are many pubs and nightclubs in the area so it is easy to walk back to in the evening if you've gone out for some nightlife, which saves cab fare.When we arrived I was really impressed with the decor - modern and clean. The reception staff are really friendly, and automatically asked where we were from and why we were visiting, and were happy to look up directions for us and give us any maps we needed. Later in the trip, they would great us every morning and give us tips on how to best get to the attractions we wanted to see that day.We got a room facing out on to York Way, so there was a bit of traffic. I am a very light sleeper, however, the traffic never once woke me up (mind you I am from Toronto, so I am a bit used to city noise). Unfortunately the window didn't open, and the air conditioner was a really big joke. The room was consistently 28 degrees and after a night of this, and an experience with no hot water in the morning, we decided to request another room. We had no problem getting another, and they even let us request a room with a window that opened into the inner courtyard. The air conditioner in here worked GREAT - and we had no more problems with sound as the courtyard blocked all outside noise.My recommendations for this hotel are:1. Request a room on the second floor in the inner courtyard area with a window that opens. This is where we had an air conditioner that actually worked, and where we could open a window. The windows on street level are permanently sealed for &quot;security&quot;. Make sure you get a room that doesn't open up onto the lobby, or I can imagine you would be up all night as it gets very busy and noisy.2. Order the breakfast. It was the exact same every day (a hot english breakfast with fresh fruit and granola, with some coffee and fruit juices) so perhaps if you're having a long stay you may wish to only book for a few days, but it was tasty and did the trick (i.e. filled me up so that I wasn't hungry at all during my daily sight seeings) Also, if you order the breakfast, you have the chance to get a discounted meal deal at dinner which is really great, and tasted amazing. 3. Use the Internet at the hotel if you're looking for a cafe. I didn't see any cafe's around, and the hotel had pretty good prices - 1 pound for 20 minutes. There are only two computers, but we generally had no problem getting access when we wanted. For the next 8 days, I stayed at 7 different hotels, and this was definitely the best I stayed at as I toured Great Britain. If anyone has any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me :)"
18,1064,"Sep 12 2009 	disappointed. Gone bad since last visit 5 years ago	I booked with great enthusiasm as I had been here 5 years ago and had been impressed.This time a few things really disappointed me: we asked for a big room as we knew exactly what it looked like, having stayed here. They gave us a small one. Fortunately they were kind enough to change it and gave us 2 choices. This first room looked tired especially compared to 5 years ago: the bathroom had signs of being flooded by mould around the tub. The duvet was clean but stained by black unidentified marks. There was dust on the desk and the bedrroom mirror. This was on the third floor. The whole building is infested by bad smells coming from the kitchen downstairs.We offered us a room on the first floor. The room was bigger and fortunately on the opposite side of the kitchen , so no smells this time. The windows were on the street which made it nicer, whereas most rooms have a view on the internal yard, quite anonimous and lifeless.But this time the bathroom was dirty. There was hair in the tub. The room had a subtle smell of not being opened with no air circulating. The mirror in the bedroom had white stains. Not at all a good impression.The thing that made us decide to go was that on the back of the receipt thay gave us there is clearly written that there is decaf coffee bags in the room , and other faciliites, which wasn't true. I rang the reception asking them to come upstairs and bring one. I was told (LIE) that they make no room service and I had to go back to the reception. I was already to go for a shower and had clearly NO INTENTION to get dressed again and go, especially if they assure that there is this and that in the room. I told the lady that I had my receipt in my hands with clearly this note and she said that unfortunately they had no one to come for service at that time of the day (6' oclock in the evening).I should have waited a little.After 30 minutes no one had showed up so we decided to leave, packed our cases and went down the reception, waiting for one of the two lifts as the other one was not working. The premature check out was quite easy as they respected their policy of giving back money if no good night's sleep, except that we stayed there for only 2 hours.A few days later I was sent online a survey form. One of the questions was if I was concerned by the credit crunch, and if I was happy to see in the future more automated service, then if I usually choose budget accomodation.. My overall impression is that they are trying to make themselves a place in the budget accomodation to the detriment of good customer service in order to save and gain as much as possible.By the way, to me 94 pounds per night in the weekend is NOT a budget accomodation."
19,1064,"Aug 31 2009 	Good location with fantastic staff	Stayed here for one night, dinner bed &amp; breakfast whilst sightseeing. Next door to Kings Cross station but remarkably quiet. Good food, with amazing breakast; great quality for a budget chain. The staff were fantastic - swift, friendly service after a days sightseeing- their attitude to all their customers was something that money couldn't buy; we were very impressed."
20,1064,"Aug 24 2009 	Great Hotel thoroughly lives up to its reviews and more	I booked this hotel based on the reviews and we were not disappointed in the slightest. The proximity to transport links cannot be over emphasised, whether arriving by train and or by air via Luton, Heathrow or Gatwick.If you have a room facing the foyer, its going to get hot and the ac would struggle in the heat of summer ( it was 31c ). You would be advised to keep the window closed to avoid any noise from the foyer. The staff are absolutely excellent and we just had a really relaxed two day stay complete with complementary iced drinks to keep cool during the minor heatwave."
21,1064,"Aug 22 2009 	perfect choice	We chose Premier Inn and particularly this site based on the reviews in this site. Well it was the right choice. Beyond the perfect location near almost every form of public transport exists in London, it is a highly recommended hotel for value for money, maintenance and quality of food and service.We stayed for 1 week with teenagers and other then not having a family room (which is the only down side of the stay-should be considered to encourage families with more then 2 kids to stay), we had a very nice and comfortable stay. The rooms were the right size clean and modern. Breakfast was good value for money (adults, 8 pounds, kid's free-all you can eat with large selection). The staff was helpful and of course the location makes the visit to London for those of us who are here for the first time very easy. Our visits in 2 other branches of the Premier Inn at Edinbrough and Oxford following the week in London were almost like returning home since everything seemed familiar. In both places we found the same high quality of service. Highly recommended hotels for those who like their vacation comfortable but not pricy!"
22,1064,"Aug 17 2009 	Disappointing	Have stayed here twice. Had hoped the bad points might improve and the good points stay the same. This report based on 5 nights and use of 2 function rooms.  Location is excellent - straight out of Kings Cross station and you're there. They also have a refund policy for serious complaints. I used this on one night. Though since it was a business stay, I'm more interested in things going right than being fixed out being given a refund.  The hotel (or lodge) is fairly soulless. The best bit is probably the adjoining Costa Coffee, or the occasionally lively bar. The rooms and corridors made me depressed - very utility, and a lack of air, light or distinguishing features. Lifts not always reliable, particularly annoying when the room keycards inevitably fail to work quote often. The lighting levels in my bedroom made it suitable for sleep and not much else. The window was a sealed unit, so the lack of air was especially annoying when the airconditioning broke down. Everything seemed screwed to the floor or strictly rationed. Not even a complimentary pencil. The room safe cost 1.50 a day, and wi-fi a whopping 5 an hour.  Evening meals I had were quite acceptable (no more) whereas breakfast was the usual lukewarm beans, budget yoghurt, fried eggs cooked to extinction, and so on. No night time food service, not even a sandwich.   Teas &amp; coffees at functions varies enormously, even within Premier Lodge. Some offer quite good value. This one gave a basic urn of very average coffee for our money and not even enough biscuits to go round. Water would be provided at considerable extra cost. The first function room was abominably stuffy and we had several complaints. The 2nd was ok, but it would have been nice if things like the remote control velux windows had been explained, especially on a hot day. It took staff three attempts to find an extension lead that worked - all very last minute, which added stress. Signage was available the first day but on a later day we were told the hotel didn't do signage - so it's pot luck who's on I suppose.  The staff were generally kind and helpful, time permitting. Not much good if your function is about to start and there's a queue at reception. The person in charge of functions on the first day did give us a discount on coffees, but having things done properly in the first place would have been better. She had a very irritating whiney voice - sorry -and would come to 'help' just at the time I least wanted to be interrupted (eg at last minute as I was setting up projector and expecting guests).  Most staff were great though, and the real problems relate to overall hotel policy and can only be sorted out at area manager level or national level."
23,1064,"Aug 13 2009 	Hot and cramped	I was travelling with my husband and three young children. We have stayed at many Premier Inns because the chain is very consistent. You always get the same exemplary level of service, similar rooms, food etc. You really know exactly what to expect. This one was no exception. The customer service is very good, rooms are clean and modern. Food is great value. This one is right next to the train/tube station so really convenient for getting to places in and around London.Negative points here - the room temperature is set on boil and you cannot turn it down, plus the windows don't open. Our first night was disturbed due to noise from a pub across the street but we got a refund for that night through the hotel's &quot;Good Night Guarantee&quot; and they moved us to a quiet room for the next 2 nights which were fine. There is no car park and parking in the recommended NCP is 25 per day.Personally I wouldn't stay here again with 3 children because there are no connecting rooms and one room is way too cramped for a family. I think it would be OK for singles or couples though."
24,1064,"Aug 11 2009 	A pleasure to have been there	Stayed at this hotel for three nights. Very comfortable bed, clean room, excellent breakfast and evening meal. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great location for tube. Very quiet, despite being in very busy area. Would definitely stay there again."
25,1064,"Aug 6 2009	Impressive service	We stayed here to be close to Kings Cross station for an early train. The room was small, but the price was right. What really impressed was the service - staff seemed genuinely committed to making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed (well, they do have a 'good night or your money back' guarentee). In house bar and restaurant were also good value and excellent service,"
26,1064,"Aug 3 2009 	Weak a/c is the most negative point.	People of the hotel are friendly, breakfast was a deal (8 pounds for adults, free for kids under 17) with eggs, mushroms, toast, muffins, british beans (sweety sauce), croissants, fruit salad, juices (orange and apple), tea, coffe and milk. The location near Kings cross metro station is very nice. There's no parking (you can park for free in London from midnight to 7am at yellow single lines or dotted white lines at sidewalk) and the internet costs 1 pound/15 minutes (there's no wi-fi). Don't forget to bring adaptors to charge your batteries. The worst part is the weak a/c mentioned before by other travellers. They intend to fix it in the future according to the manager."
27,1064,"Jul 29 2009 	Can't beat it esp. for the location to Kings Cross trains / St. Pancras	My husband and I flew in late on Saturday July 4, 2009 from NJ. We were visiting our son who lives in Cambridge. This was our first time in the UK. The good people on the forums suggested staying here for the location. They were not wrong, the location was the best for our purposes. We stayed 2 nights but not consecutively because we were also staying in Cambridge with our son. The morning we had to leave on the Eurostar for Paris was so relaxing because it was right across the street from this hotel.The hotel was clean, staff friendly and accomodating and the breakfast was satisfying.Our first night they had to change our room because the AC was not working and that was the last night of the heat wave that the UK had. I had visions of melting in there. NO.They changed our rooms in about 15 minutes. Thank you Premier Inn for a good stay."
28,1064,Jul 28 2009 	Great Location for Public Transport	Stayed for 2 nights. Clean hotel with an excellent location for Kings Cross. A bit expensive compared to other Premier lodges but that's London for you.
29,1064,"Jul 27 2009 	Excellent accommodations without all the unnecessary frills.	We were a family on holiday. Mom, dad, and one-year old arrived by train from Belgium. The Premier Inn not only had an excellent location for travelers using the St. Pancras International Rail Station (2-3 minute walk), but the rooms were very nice and service was friendly and responsive. The rooms were large with a nice, comfortable bed and a good shower. Service was immediate upon arrival, and it was courteous and informative. Further, we traveled with an infant, and the hotel provided us with a Graco &quot;Pack In Play&quot; crib, which is an ideal accommodation for a baby on the road. Cost was fair considering the excellent condition and service of the hotel. It did not have all the frills, but I don't need or generally want them, so it was more than adequate to stay at a very nice hotel without all the unwanted service options that presumably increase the fare. The restaurant provided a good buffet for a reasonable price as well."
30,1064,"Jul 27 2009 	Great but do not stay in the room facing inside lobby	Great, clean hotel. Perfect location. Excellent breakfast and the staff during breafkast service was superb! The only disadvantage was the noise. We sayed in the room facing the inside lobby. Even though our room was on the 4th floor it was so noisy down in the lobby till about 1am that we simply could not fall asleep."
31,1064,"Jul 23 2009 	Very comfortableclean and quiet	We stayed here the evening of Friday 17 July as we had an early Eurostar train the following morning and did not want the inconvenience of traveling to King's Cross from South London so early. This hotel is a 2 minute walk from King's Cross.I checked in at 4.30pm. The person at reception was extremely helpful. Their automated check-in service is very convenient, particularly if there is a queue or large group of people checking in.The room itself was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was absolutely huge and extremely comfortable, and spare pillows are provided. There was a flatscreen tv on the wall which has freeview. There are tea/coffee making facilities which is handy. In fact this is the first time we have had tea/coffee in the room in the last 6 hotels we have stayed in (ranging from 5 -2 star).There is a small wardrobe which is large enough for an overcoat, a man's suit and a couple of shirts. There is no chest of drawers or similar bit there is a shelving unit under the desk area. The desk area has a chair so you would be able to sit and work. Inside the wardrobe there is a safe which is large enough to fit a laptop inside. The room is air conditioned which you can easily adjust or switch off.The bathroom was functional with a good shower. There is shower gel provided. Decent towels. Clean.We ate at the hotel that evening as we were in a hurry. They offer 2-course meals for 10. We went for the 'a la carte' menu. We had fish &amp; chips and scampi &amp; chips. Both were about 9 each and were fine. Other items on the menu include sausage &amp; mash, burger &amp; chips, pizzas, jacket potatoes. Nothing fancy but enough choice to meet pretty much everyone's needs. The service was a slightly slow but the staff were very pleasant.We didn't have breakfast as we left before it started.We ordered a wake up call the next morning and it arrived on time.All of the staff we encountered - there are lots of staff around - were pleasant and very well trained. The hotel was very quiet - they offer you your money back if you do not have a good sleep and they cannot resolve the problem. We had the best night's sleep we have had in ages and I definitely recommend this hotel for business people, those having a short stay in London or those who have a crack-of-dawn train.At 90 per night it was decent value, in a convenient location and its MILES better than the Royal Scott King's Cross Travelodge I stayed at earlier this year when I had another early train. Premier Inn was 12 more than that place and was about 1,000 times better."
32,1064,"Jul 22 2009 	Just Perfect	After keeping track of the reviews of this Hotel on Tripadvisor for a numer of weeks I booked a family room through their call centre for 7 nights in July back in January. On the day of arrival we actually were there early and the helpful front desk staff put our luggage in the strong room so that we could go about in London. We checked in later. The staff was very helpful throughout the whole of our stay especially the restaurant staff. Travelling with small kids could be a hassle but the location of this hotel just a throw from Kings' Cross is excellent for the tube. The room was very good, the bed was very spacious and the kids had mattresses on the floor to sleep on but still very comfortable. In fact they enjoyed it. The hotel is very clean and modern and contributed a lot towards our total enjoyment of the holiday. In simple words it was 'just perfect'"
33,1064,"Jul 21 2009 	fantastic!	This hotel is situated very close to Kings Cross tube station so getting around London from there was easy. The rooms were very pleasant and clean. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. We really did get 5 star service at a snip of the price! We dined there on two occasions and the standard of food was very good, the service was excellent! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in London....beats many much more &quot;upmarket&quot; and expensive hotels &quot;hands down&quot;!"
34,1064,"Jul 19 2009 	An excellent choice	Location was most important to us, and this hotel was perfect - two rail stations within 5 minute walk (Kings Cross &amp; St. Pancras) and their shared underground allowing daytrips outside London and easy access to just about anywhere in London. The room was typically small but clean and comfortable. The staff was terrific - seemed delighted we were there. Buffet breakfast was very good, with attentive staff in a nice room. Several pubs and restaurants within a few blocks."
35,1064,"Jul 13 2009 	5-Star Staff!!!!!	Excellent value for your money!! You're treated like royalty; the staff know you by name; and everyone works to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to London. It's conveniently located to the Underground and other train travel options, and the staff are very helpful and concerned about all the guests."
36,1064,"Jul 12 2009 	good value	well priced motel in good location. Not what im used to in Australia as it didnt have a fridge, But staff were very helpful, rooms were clean and quiet, handy location to underground. would definitely stay again when visiting London"
37,1064,"Jul 11 2009 	Bathtub was much needed luxury	Immediately when I checked in I knew this hotel was a quality hotel. The staff is very professional and polite from the first moment you get in the entrance.The room was very spacious, very clean and had air conditioning unit. The bed was comfortable. Room tv had a lot of channels available. The best of all was the little gem: a real bathtub in the bathroom. After being on travel for 4 days already it felt like luxury to be able to have an actual bath. That really made my day.The location is really great next to King's Cross station but still the room was very quiet. Only noise I experince came forom the floor hallway. This is in my opinion the only place for improvement, even though I didn't have a real trouble with it. I heard people talking in the corridor clearly when they were going in/out to rooms. I would think that for axample a group of people on the floor halls might cause an annoyance for a light sleeper. All in all I really enjoyed my time on this hotel and I was very satisfied both with the room and the staff."
38,1064,"Jul 10 2009 	Good Choice - Found Hotel Using TripAdvisor	Bad: $7.50/day wireless internet (long-term discount availible); air-conditioning broken; no gymGood: Kids eat free (like Holiday Inn) and decent sized, newish, American hotel feel (except for the missing washcloth which is typical in Europe); lots of snack and dining options on-site.We stayed twice in late June and early July, once for a week in London, and then for a night before we went to Airport after a week in France. Read the other reviews to see why the location is one of the hotel's bigest selling points (direct subway from LHR, next door to Eurorail, etc.). London DOES get hot in the summer, and we weren't the only ones with a broken A/C unit (shouldn't be happening at a newer hotel?). Family rooms are on 1st floor and kids have mattresses on the floor which slide under a large bed for parents for storage. If this is your first trip to Europe, or first with kids, this is a good hotel since it isn't much different those in US and you can transition to really small (bed, room size, etc.) and high-priced hotels later. Kids will love the nearby KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, etc. Moms and Dads will like the nearby pubs and Tesco (grocery/convience store chain)."
39,1064,"Jul 10 2009 	Frist Class	Welcoming staff, lovely clean and comfortable room &amp; bathroom. Dinner was also of a very high standard, as was the breakfast. Would definitely stay here again."
40,1064,"Jul 6 2009	Absoluteley brilliant - Great staff Clean room lovely breakfast !	I have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my daughter. i was a little apprehensive as I have never visited London before without my husband..I was pleasantly suprised.The hotel was spotless, the room excellent, Great , reasonably priced food, but what sets this hotel apart are the friendly , attentive staff. Nothing was too much trouble.Whilst I noticed how attentive the staff were I similarly noticed how rude some customers were to staff and yet they still smiled through it all!Sincere thanks for a very pleasant stay."
41,1064,"Jul 6 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!	My trip to London was for me and my sisters to treat mum to a show at the Palladium. I booked accommodation at the Premier Inn, Kings Cross because it's a good central location and the cost of the room was very competitive with other hotels in the area. After spending 2 nights there, I can honestly say that it exceeded my expectations. The room was comfy, clean and modern with a nice flat screen tv that actually worked (I'm just not used to this.) The breakfast buffet (a 7.95 charge on top for eat as much you want) was one of the hotel breakfasts I've had. A huge amount of choice with a an excellent English breakfast and decent toast!! The real reason for me writing a review, however, was to really comment on the exceptional service provided. With the exception of one 'grumpy' man who I actually believe to be one of the managers of the team, the others simply couldn't do enough for you. The receptionists and, in particular, the restaurant staff were just fab. Whoever provides their training on customer relations has done an excellent job. Well done!Would most definately recommend it and be using the place again."
42,1064,Jul 4 2009 	Excellent hotel great location excellent service and facilities.	From start to finish we could not fault this hotel. Clean airconditioned double room with plenty of space. Excellent value breakfast and staff very approachable and helpful. Great position for easy access to both Gatwick and Heathrow Airports and easy access to the London Underground with the proximity to Kings Cross - St Pancreas stations.
43,1064,"Jul 4 2009 	Great mid-range hotel clean great staff and a plush bed!	Very good mid-range hotel for london, premier does a great job of prioritizing service as all staff were very helpful and greeted us with smiles. The room was contemporary and clean like some nicer hotel chains. The tv was a nice lcd screen. We chose to opt out of the 8 pound breakfast and just grab some sausage and egg sandwiches from the small deli up the street. The hotel is conveniently located literally around the corner from the kings cross underground station. The bed was also super comfortable with a nice fluffy comforter and pillows. No free wifi."
44,1064,"Jul 2 2009 	Good mid-range hotel but not in the summer	Nicer than a Travelodge, Premier Inn's are firmly in the 2.5 - 3* range. The Kings Cross Premier Inn is recent build and as such, it's quite modern in style and furnishing. Rooms have basic, but functional furnishings with large beds, nice bathrooms and flat screen TV.Nothing is overly luxurious, but all is functional. Staff were pleasant, and the location is excellent - Kings Cross allows you to connect to rail, underground and bus services with ease. Some of their rates can be quite expensive for what you're getting, due to it's location.However, if I were to stay here again, it really would depend on the time of year. Premier Inn made a major fumble here. For what is a relatively recent build hotel, the absolutely abysmal air conditioning they installed is unforgivable. The system is next to useless, with little or no cool air coming from the units. The hotel know it's an issue and take steps to keep the temperature down, but at the end of the day they simply aren't effective. Yes sheets instead of the duvet are nice, and housekeeping closing the curtains to &quot;keep the temperature down&quot; is a step in the right direction. However, during London's hot, hot summers they simple are not able to combat the oven-like room conditions. Room fans are nice, but at the end of the day they only move warm air around. People who have never stayed here before may think this is an over-exaggeration, but I'm afraid it isn't. The heat in the hotel is beyond unpleasant and into unbearable. So much so, sleep is extremely hard to come by.So yes, I would stay here again at the right price - but no price would tempt me to stay here during the summer period. During cooler periods, sure, but nothing on earth could make me go there during high temperatures. Sorry, Premier Inn, but you screwed up badly with the air conditioning in this property and it loses big marks on that front."
45,1064,"Jun 29 2009 	Superb location and facilities	I stayed here for a couple of days as my base for travelling to Hyde Park for a music festival. My primary reason for choosing this hotel was the proximity of the hotel to Kings Cross station - I was booked on the 10am train home which meant time for a leisurely breakfast before the 2 minute walk to Kings Cross.A bit of background for non-UK visitors: Kings Cross / St Pancras is one of London's transport hubs, buses go to all round the city from there, overground trains from all over the north of the country and underground trains all over the city, are all easily accessed from there. So the hotel being just round the corner means it's ideally placed.In common with Premier Inns around the country, there's also a good restaurant and bar attached, and this one also has a Costa coffee downstairs. An added bonus of this one is the Tesco Metro next door for anything you've forgotten.So what's the hotel itself like?Well, it's a Premier Inn so there's a certain level to expect. Comfortable beds, fresh linen &amp; towels, clean bathrooms, TV, tea &amp; coffee making facilities in room. All the basics you need for a stay away from home. Breakfast is worth buying at 7.95 a pop, it sets you up for the rest of the day I find, meaning no need to stop for lunch.Staff as always are extremely helpful and polite and give the impression that nothing is too much trouble.So what's wrong with the rooms, that I've only given mine 3/5? Well, when I was in London the daily temperature was approaching 30degC. Hot, humid and stuffy. The air-conditioning in my room though had to be seen to be believed. Ineffective is not the word for it. It wasn't that it was broken - it was just that it was possibly the worst air-con I've ever seen. I've stayed in other Premier Inns where the air-con has been excellent so they know what to do. A table top fan had been provided by the hotel but this just blows the warm air around, it doesn't cool it. There was a note on the table in the room from the manager, introducing the hotel and facilities which also said that the fan was available and that the cleaning staff would leave the curtains shut during the day to help minimise the temperature. So the hotel are aware of the problem and know how to fix it.Apart from that though, I'd recommend the hotel and would stay there again - but not in the summer until they renew the air-con!"
46,1064,"Jun 28 2009 	I would definitely go back	Four of us (2 adults, 2 children) stayed for a total of 5 nights (2 different rooms on different dates) and really liked it. The Pros:1. Location (nice and close to The Tube and Rail stations)2. Modern Rooms. The rooms (we stayed in 2 different rooms) were modern and clean3. Wifi Access (not free though)4. Food. The restaurant had good food and was a good value for the Kids at dinner.5. Price. This hotel represents very good value.The Cons:1. Front Desk service was not great. This was a minor issue however and did not create any major inconveniences. Would I stay here again? Most definitely."
47,1064,"Jun 27 2009 	Great hotel reasonable priced in convenient location. Fantastic staff 	We spent 2 nights at the Premier Inn Kings Cross in May 2009 with our two children aged 11 and 5. We were arriving from the US after a 4-night stop in Disneyland, and decided to have a brief break in London, and a chance to see the sights, before driving to South Wales.I chose the hotel on the basis of location, price and favourable TripAdvisor reviews. We were a little apprehensive of what to expect, having not stayed in London before and feeling a little dubious about the more &quot;budget&quot; priced accommodations. However we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived.Basically, it's 4star without the little &quot;luxury extras&quot;. We had a tv, kettle with coffee/tea making facilities, and plenty of room to store all our luggage despite the fact that we were sleeping 4 in the one room. Our room contained a king size bed, a single bed, and there was a very comfy mattress on the floor beside our bed for the 5 year old. In fact, all the beds were very comfy. Everything was modern and absolutely spotlessly clean. We had dinner in the restuarant both evenings - the food was great, with very generous servings, and extremely polite, friendly and helpful staff. We also booked the breakfast, which was 7.95 per adult and free for the kids. It was fabulous! There was everything you could ask for: toast, croissants, bacon, sausages, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, several varieties of cereal, granola, yoghurt, muesli, porridge, freshly cut fruit, tea, coffee, juice ... all you can eat.The location was really convenient, being across the road from Kings Cross/St Pancras stations. The front desk staff were great. We had trouble calling Avis (our Avis pick-up location had changed the phone number since we had made our booking), so the front desk were more than happy to find the number, and call Avis for us to confirm our vehicle pickup, and then help us arrange a taxi to get us and all our luggage to the pick-up location. The hotel is also very conveniently located for rental car pick-up - Avis Euston is a 5 taxi ride from the hotel. You could walk it easily, but not with the luggage that we had!It was also very reasonably priced when compared with other London hotels that have less favourable TripAdvisor reviews.I would have no hesitation booking a Premier Inn in the future. Incidentally, we also spent a night in Premier Inn Gatwick on our return home, organised by British Airways when our flight out of Heathrow was cancelled. We received the same high quality service at Gatwick Premier Inn as we did at Kings Cross."
48,1064,"Jun 24 2009 	excellent value and location for London	When we were planning to visit London, our dilemma was the high cost of hotels in general.We looked at many around 100BP per night and this one came up; we also double checked with TripAdvisor and was happy to see the rating.We booked and stayed there for 1 week from end of May to Jun.Conveniently located near the Underground and train station (St. Pancras).It's clean and service is very good.Since we were out trotting around London, we didn't need any other facilities like swimming pool, spa, etc.For those from North America, this is comparable to Day's Inn, Comfort Inn."
49,1064,"Jun 24 2009 	A great hotel in central London	Modern, clean, efficient and friendly - I just can't criticise this hotel at all. This is the second time I've stayed there and will definitely go back on any future trips to London. Was particularly impressed this time with the friendliness and helpfulness of the mostly young, enthusiastic staff. The breakfasts were great, and you can pay for them on the day if you're not sure of your plans. Location is ideal, especially if, like us, you are arriving at Kings Cross - its really is a 2 minute walk. Our room was very quiet, had air conditioning, and the beds are huge and very, very comfortable."
50,1064,"Jun 23 2009 	Excellent choice for London!	We stayed for one night and were extremely happy with the hotel. We paid 90 pounds for one night, which in comparison for what you will get for a budget hotel (of 60-80 pounds) in this area/London is very good! The room itself was a great size and had a huge bed - my partner is very tall so it was excellent that we had extra room without being cramped. The room also had a kettle and tea/coffee, as well as a great bathroom that was very clean. I stay in a hotel approximately once per month and I was very happy with this hotel. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that I didn't realise that there are 2 of the same hotels in the area so actually went to the Euston Rd one first....but think the one on York Way is better. I know London very well so I was able to walk everywhere from this location but I think first time visitors would also be happy to stay in this area- lots of facilities and easy to get around...also perfect for Eurostar! ps I am 34 y.o female who doesn't like the idea of 'budget' hotels but very happy with this one!"
