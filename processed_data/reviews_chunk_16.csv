342,372,"Nov 25 2006 	Fantastic Value for Money	We only paid 21 a night to stay at Hooters and, because it was so cheap, only booked to stay for half our holiday in case it was a dive - we wished we'd stayed the whole time! The rooms were big, clean and comfortable and the hotel is a five minute walk from MGM Grand and New York, New York. The staff were pleasant too. We ate at the Dam restaurant twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner - $6.95 for a prime rib dinner, bargain! We heard some americans complaining about the standard of the hotel but, as a brit, I thought it was fantastic value for money and would definitely stay there again - half the price of a travel inn but double the room size and nicer to boot."
343,372,"Nov 21 2006 	Hurray for Hooters!!	Just got back from a 3 day trip to Vegas-stayed at Hooters on Saturday and Sunday nights (rates of $69 and $49)! We loved the hotel. Great location directly across from MGM and next to Tropicana. We stayed on the 8th floor at the end of the hallway so there was no noise at all. Our room was spotless and looked brand new (new carpet, new furniture, great fluffy towels in bathroom). For the price and location, Hooters was great! We did gamble here before going to the airport. We usually play at $5 blackjack tables but they only had $10 tables (go next door to the Trop for $5). The dealers were very friendly-and we actually won some money before going home!!!! Took a cab to the airport and the total only came to $7.50 so that was great also. I can't understand the bad reviews---although I would definitely not stay in the bungalow rooms (around the pool, separate buildings). Heard some complaints about those. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend! We didn't eat here but heard from some people that DAM restaurant was good."
344,372,"Nov 19 2006 	Hooters is NOT a new hotel!	My wife and I have just returned from a trip to Las Vegas, We booked our hotel online, when the price for the room showed up at what we thought was a too good to be true price. We called to talk in person to verify there was no mistake. We were instucted that the rate was a promotional rate because it was a new hotel. We were given a choice of tower rooms or poolside bungalows.We chose a bungalow. BAD DECISION! First, there is nothing &quot;new&quot; about this hotel. It is a slightly refurbished group of old buildings. The bungalow room we were given was dirty, and rundown to say the least. As it was late in the evening we decided to &quot;deal with it &quot; for the night. We attempted to clean our room, only to notice there were ants crawling all over the bathroom counter. Not to worry a few ants can't be that big of a deal, I will just take a quick shower and take care of things in the morning, Hah ! Not a chance, unless a cold shower was good enough, after all it was a cheap rate. The hot water was almost non existent in the tub. I don't mean that the water would only flow cold, I mean water wouldn't flow at more than a trickle from the hot water faucet.( this &quot;new&quot; hotel has old two handle faucets, probably got a good deal on them on E-bay) The water flow wasn't enough to make the shower head spray. At least the bed had a comfortable mattress. Upon going to the front desk in the morning and bringing my concerns to their attention, I was informed &quot; What do you expect you booked the cheapest room in the place&quot; After being insulted in a such a manner, I answered back &quot; I don't consider a clean, bug free room with running hot water to be too much to ask for. After a few more snotty comments from both sides I was informed, I would be moved to a tower room for the remainder of my stay, however they wouldn't be able to move me until the afternoon.The remainder of my stay went off without any additonal problems, however I do not believe I will consider returning to a hotel where it is OK to allow a guest to pay the &quot;asking price&quot; for a room, misrepresent what that room is, then insult the guest for not paying more."
345,372,Nov 19 2006 	Fantastic hotel	You cant go wrong with this hotel perfect location opposite the mgm grand very clean very welcoming first class accomodation at a bargain price could not have wished for a better stay would go back tommorow if I couldn you wont be dissapointede thats for sure.
346,372,"Nov 11 2006 	Dont Stay Here	This hotel is horrible. I'm a 26 year male who went with three other friends to Las Vegas for spring break last spring. My friends insisted on this hotel because it was Hooters. I resisted after reading reviews on this site, and knowing that you don't go to &quot;Hooters&quot; expecting to meet women. Apparently my friends don't realize this (probably why they remain single). Well, we arrived early and the desk clerk was nice enough to give us our room key and let us check and see if the room was ready or not. We go up and the room is filthy which, I expected because it hadn't been cleaned yet and, its Las Vegas. We booked a &quot;suite&quot;. Tthis nothing more than an apartment room and an adjoining single room with a bathroom, its a joke. We go back down let the front desk know the room isn't ready and go back up 2 hours later. The room is &quot;cleaned&quot;, but still smells of stale cigarette smoke and vomit. Not only this but we drop our bags and begin to walk around and the floor is soaking wet in the whole living room. We call mantinence and they do nothing so we complain and receive a new room not a &quot;suite&quot;, along with the discounted price. This room is dirtier than the first one but at least the carpet's not wet. We also found roaches, the kind you step on, AND the kind you smoke, and on that note you have to deal with people offering you drugs on the elevator.I really can't put into words how cheap and nasty this place is. I mean four guys in their twenties hated this place, thats how bad it is. Its important when in Vegas to decide where you will spend most of your time. If on the strip, spend the money and stay at a decent place like Mandalay Bay, New York, Bellagio. My favorite was the Venetian. If you are looking for a good time and cheap thrills, and some cool bars, stay downtown in Old Vegas. Hotels are more important in Vegas than anywhere else, because everything is centered around them on the strip. Heed my advice stay away from this hotel!"
347,372,"Nov 7 2006 	Felt very welcome	We were not sure what to expect, but we were very happy with everything there. All the staff were very friendly and questions were answered right away. the pool area was nice the way they have it set up, no matter where you were sitting you had a good view of all the action going on. George the security guy by the pool was so very friendly even if he had to keep his eye on alot of things.The room was just perfect. Well i was not to crazy about the colors, but who cares, the beds were so very, very comfortable. we were right behind the elevators and i worried about the sound, but that was doable also.I would stay there again in a second. very close to things we wanted to see.As a first time Black Jack player, i felt that the dealer was so nice to help explaine things and even when i lost I felt that she felt for me, nice."
348,372,Nov 6 2006 	Laid back atmosphere	After staying in Excalibur down the way from this hotal for the first 2 days of our trip we headed to Hooters to check in. Much smaller hotal then the others that are connected like Luxor and Excalibur. Waited a few minutes to check in and the guy at the desk seemed confused at what he was doing but no biggy we were given our room keys and away we go. The hotal is a little crowded being smaller then other hotals in the area. Its at the end of the strip near the motal 6. Everything is wood and orange like a Hooters restaurant.The room was clean and bright whic is more then I can say for the Excalibur. Same amount of room with 2 double beds and room to lay out a air mattress we brought due to we are 3 guys. Good options to stay in your such as Directv sports that can be ordered. Being from Canada and wanting to catch the hockey game we tried to order through the remote but wasn't working. Called down to the desk and was hung up on by accident and then tried agian and spoke with Robert who said try again in a few minutes and he hung up.Waited a few minutes and it worked and we enjoyed the live hockey from Montreal. Had some ice cold brews we bought at a gas station which was much cheaper then anything in the hotals. Ate and drank once at the on site hooters restaurant which I think is one of the worst restaurants out there in food quality which I still feel the same. Ate mosly at the 24hr dinar called the Dam which had $6.95 prime rib which was the best deal in Vegas we found. Ate at Dan marinos and was the best meal we had all week but also costed the most at a cool $50 before tip for a steak. They do have other lower cost foods so don't get scared away.Most people said there wern't that much hooter girls around but I saw plenty from working in the resaurant or dealing at a table in the casino there was no shortage of the eye candy. Not a whole lot going on in the hotal as in shows so we walked to the other hotals. Saw Howie Mandel at MGM and Fantasy a topless revue at Luxor which are only 5 - 10 mins away.
349,372,Nov 5 2006	Great Time Had By All	Once again the staff at hooters were great. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Nothing was any trouble. We will definitely stay there again next time we go to Vegas. The bed was the best we've ever slept in.
350,372,Oct 28 2006 	I Hate Hooters!!!!	Parking Elevators are on their last legs and smells bad. Was treated rudely by the front desk girl as soon as we checked in. The room smelled musty and the bathroom is a dump. Took forever for the water to get hot and drainage pipes smelled like sewage coming out of them. No fridge in the room. Very Thin Walls and you could hear your neighbors and housekeeping talking and gossiping. For the Price We paid We could have got better Hotel on the strip. Im pissed that I cancelled a room at the Stratosphere for this dump. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. More like a Roach Motel than a Hotel.
351,372,"Oct 27 2006 	Very nice hotel very pretty girls	We stayed at the Hooters hotel for two nights and my husband and I agree that it was a good choice to stay there. The hotel is located close tot the strip. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean and cosy. We ate at the Hooters restaurant twice and the food is really good, try the chicken wings. The girls are sweet and pretty. The pool is clean and they provide towels. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much."
1,373,Nov 8 2009 	Nice surprise!	I didn't know what to expect from Hotel32 and was pleasantly surprise by this hotel. It delivered on the promises made in the marketing email I received!
2,373,Oct 30 2009 	Nice but way overpriced	I have stayed in some nice penthouses on the strip including my favorite the skylofts at MGM. I stayed in a 2 bedroom penthouse at hotel 32 and even though it was nice it was average. The cost was $1200 per night. The skylofts run from $600 --$1250 per night for a 2 floor 2 bedroom penthouse. The only thing that was better in this room over the other penthouses were the bathrooms. They could of used a better TV in the bathrooms but that aside they were nice. Hotel 32 prides themselves on saying they are a sister to the Skylofts. Well in this comparrison the Skyloft is a bikini model and Hotel 32 is the pretty girl next door that just has that 1 weird thing about her that you just can't really put your finger on LOL. I would visit again if the room was more like $400-$500 per. No extras like free beverages or snacks in your room. They do offer some free treats all day down the hall. I didn't find anything in there I was crazy about but they do go the extra mile in there for you. Very nice people. They cater to you but don't crowd you like the skylofts. One thing I disliked and find trashy is the bathroom is all glass even the entrance door to the bathroom. I don't and I repeat don't want to see someone going to the bathroom. The bathroom should have a wooden door. It's like this in a regular suite also I was told. No women is that pretty to be seen using a bathroom.......now add 15 years of marriage to that and it gets sadder LOL. Didn't use the pool. They have a floating river and wave pool but its very small. Mandalay bay has the same type of pool area but the wave and river pools are much much larger then Monte carlo (hotel 32). The casino was fun but very low maximum bets. $50 on 3 card poker and Let it ride. The tables had low minimun bets though $5 and $10. The slots were very loose. One other thing. The web site makes the penthouses seem better then they really are. They are nice but at a reasonable rate. Have fun.
3,373,Oct 11 2009 	Low key hotel with great location on the Vegas Strip	I have stayed in Vegas many time but never at the Monte Carlo. It was a great value during the over priced Labor Day weekend. It was a low key hotel. You can't beat the location.
4,373,"Oct 7 2009 	Great rooms and service	I stayed at Hotel 32 in the 1200 sqft Loft suite and it was fantastic. My stay was comped but these rooms normally go for $600 a night. All 4 nights of my stay were quiet and comfortable. If you book a room at Hotel 32, they will send a limo to pick you up from the airport and take you to the main Monte Carlo entrance. There a suite assistant will greet you and escort you to the 32nd floor to check in. There is almost never any line up at the hotel 32 front desk. The assistants will take you for a tour of your room and teach you how to use the LCD control box to turn on the TV's, lights and drapes. Even the shower is electronic! I was impressed. The bed was extra comfy.The Monte Carlo itself is a very quiet casino compared to the others on the strip. In the evenings, other hotels would be full of people gambling, walking around, drinking, etc. The Monte Carlo just didn't compare, especially in the category of having beautiful people around. Sigh. The gambling for this trip was fantastic for me and I was able to leave Las Vegas as a winner. Drink service at the tables were average and the dealers on the most part were friendly and wanted you to win. I ate at the 24 hour Cafe and the Pub once and the food was above average. Didn't try the buffet but I've had it before in prior trips and it was ok. I saw Terry Fator and Love this trip and I liked Terry Fator the best. Love was kind of boring for me but I'm not old enough to appreciate the Beatles.Overall my stay at Hotel 32 was great. My room, food and beverage was all comped. I highly recommend Hotel 32 as a great floor to stay on but the casino itself could be a little more alive."
5,373,"Aug 26 2009	Hotel 32 - A New Hotel and a good experience	I have to be in Las Vegas for business and having stayed in most of the hotels I am keen to try the new ones. I heard about Hotel 32 on the top of the Monte Carlo a few weeks ago and it got me excitied.In the last week I was able to experience it, the process is very cool. Once you book they called me to arrange the free limo trip from the airport ( I love this as I hate the taxi line). When I arrived my suite assistant took me to the hotel on the 32 floor. They have a lounge where I was offered a drink and snacks etc.Then Amber ( the suite assistant) took me to my Studio 51, the room is decorated in a cool white colour scheme and it had a massive long blue sofa. They gave me a fruit arrival ammenity and free Voss water.That night I got a turn down and a small chocolate plate was left for me in my room. Breakfast was great in the lounge and I could see them building City Centre.I had a great stay in the hotel, the team are working hard to make this special and it was- I will return if only for the Limo ride"
1,375,Oct 17 2009 	Outside the Strip calm and convenient close to airport	The Hyatt Place Las Vegas is close to the airport. Welcome starts with a free Shuttle Bus available upon upon arrival at the airport (though
2,375,Sep 5 2009 	Great stay	This is a great place to stay if you have a car and want to be off the strip. We stayed 4 nights and I never heard a plain (we were on floor 2 facing the parking). Service was great
3,375,Jul 25 2009 	Great airport/UNLV hotel but in a somewhat sketchy area	This is my second stay at a Hyatt Place property and I really like what they've done with these &quot;older&quot; hotels. The decor is so modern and classy. I like the furniture
4,375,Jun 23 2009 	Great Airport hotel!	I had an overnight layover and chose to stay in this Hyatt brand hotel. We frequent Hyatt hotels and this is a very smart
5,375,Jun 4 2009 	Pleasurable stay	As a travel agent
6,375,Apr 22 2009 	If you value sleep stay elsewhere!	1. The hotel is right under the flight plan of planes taking off from Las Vegas Airport and is very loud. 2. The hotel staff at check-in gave me my room card and did not explain the amenities of the hotel. (I've stayed at Hyatt Place before
7,375,Apr 13 2009 	Stay away safety comes first!	Bad
8,375,Mar 30 2009 	Surprised Me! They Renovated The Amerisuites.	I use to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel all the time. But sometimes when I couldn't get a room I would stay across the street at the Amerisuites. Mediocre at best and overpriced. BUT NOW! I booked through the Hyatt web site and they surprised me by booking me at the SAME PROPERTY UNDER A NEW NAME. It was WAY WAY WAY BETTER! Everything. Rooms
9,375,Jan 22 2009	Clean Comfortable Handy Little Place	I stayed here last weekend for one night on a Saturday and was familiar with the location as I frequent the Hard Rock Hotel and have also passed by the Hyatt Place on my way to the Vegas airport. Like almost all things in L.V.
10,375,Jan 21 2009 	Great Stay	Booked a room through Hotwire for around $50 USD/night. Hotel looks great. Rooms are big
11,375,Jan 21 2009 	Poor Choice for CES Attendees	As a travel arranger for our company I made this reservation directly on short notice due to all other hotels filled. My traveler attended a convention and this hotel was on the shuttle route. However
12,375,Jan 9 2009 	Hyatt Place in Vegas	This Hyatt Place is nicely set up... location is actually pretty good. It's directly across corners from the Hard Rock Resort. We did the walk from the Hyatt Place to the strip
13,375,Jan 1 2009 	Warning - Its in the Flight path	We are staying at the Hyatt as we speak. We came to Vegas for the New Year and chose the hotel after reading the reviews
14,375,Nov 29 2008 	Great Rooms	This is a very clean 
15,375,Nov 24 2008 	Not up to Par	This was my second stay at this property and this stay was not as good as the last. Great TV and great bed but the room was a little dirty. The elliptical machine in the workout room had old dirt and sweat and looked like it hadn't been wiped down in a long while. The gym wipe dispenser was out of wipes too! Breakfast was unimpressive. They ran out of juice glasses and charge extra money for eggs or sausage. Some of the staff members were friendly while others were not. Guys that stepped off the shuttle bus in suites where greeted warmly. The staff just kind of stared at me when I walked in like maybe they thought I wanted to rob the place and I'm a GP Platinum member who travels regularly. This place also smells. When Hyatt remodeled the property they apparently spend money on new granite
16,375,Nov 20 2008	Ok for families. Don't expect much.	Hyatt was good w/ our kid. We had to share a room
17,375,Nov 17 2008 	Great Place to Stay!	We stayed at the Hyatt Place Nov 5th - 10th
18,375,Aug 26 2008 	A normal business/leisure hotel in Las Vegas!	I had a pleasant stay at Hyatt Place. I found it pleasant because of several things it didn't have: no resort fee
19,375,Aug 17 2008 	A Vegas gem!	I LOVED this hotel. Exceptionally friendly and attentive staff
20,375,Aug 11 2008 	Great place at a great price	It is a little bit off the strip
21,375,Jul 31 2008 	Best place to stay if you hate all the traffic	We stayed here 4th of July weekend. Have been to Vegas before and hate all the time it takes to get in and out of hotel. Hotel staff was very nice
22,375,Jul 29 2008 	some issues not a great stay	I hate Las Vegas. I needed to stay here for one night and wanted a hotel with no casino
23,375,Jul 19 2008 	Good Quiet Vegas Location	This Hyatt Place is close to Vegas airport
24,375,Jun 20 2008 	Nice rooms but heed the location	This HP shares the typical stylish decor with other HP locations
25,375,Jun 2 2008 	best place to stay off the strip for bussiness travel	We were very satisfied with the service at this location; the staff is extremely accommodating always with a smile
26,375,Feb 13 2008	nice place-off strip.	myself and my girlfriend stayed here for one night after our flight was canceled.delta airlines put us up free of charge
27,375,Feb 11 2008 	Pleasant stay	Stayed here after Delta cancelled our flight and booked us in here. Located very close to the airport and the free shuttle will collect and/or drop you to airport.Reception staff member was most unhelpful when we discovered we had to return to airport and collect a different voucher from the airline to pay for our stay - she wouldn't let us leave our luggage even though the stay was confirmed by DL. Not our favourite person!Room was lovely
28,375,Feb 4 2008 	Good deal - Off Strip	Good deal
29,375,Feb 4 2008 	Helped us in a Pinch	Satyed here when our flight was canceled. It's less than a mile from the airport- so we picked it for closeness and the free shuttle service from the airport (and the cost
30,375,Jan 15 2008	Beware the jet noise	When the wind shifts the hotel is directly under the departing flight pattern for way to close McCarran Airport. At midnight we decided to give it a count

32,375,Jun 2 2009 	Gutes Hotel - leider in Einflugschneise des Flughafens		
1,376,"Robbed	The place was horrible. Not only was service terrible when we first arrived but we were actually robbed in the middle of the night while we slept. We think someone from the staff did it as our door was locked. When we reported the incident the following morning, we were ignored by security and he actually told us to hope &quot;our money may be returned&quot;. That was all he could did. Never again will I stay here. With the money we lost. we could have stayed somewhere way better."
2,376,"Reviews here are pretty much right on	The best reason to stay at the Imperial Palace is location - it is pretty much in the heart of the strip and the middle of everything. That and the price were my main reasons for staying. I would have preferred to stay somewhere nicer, but for the money, this hotel was a good deal. Not a whole lot to do - nightlife is pretty much non existent at the IP, but other hotels are close by so there is always something to do. Rooms were decent - nothing spectacular by any means, but the shower was hot and the water pressure was really good. Noise level was okay unless someone was being loud in the hallway (it's Vegas so that's going to happen). Our room was by the pop machine and I did get a little perturbed at someone filling it at 7 am! The saying - &quot;you get what you paid for&quot; and that's what you'll get at IP."
3,376,loved the place.. for the money it's great	right in the middle of all the BIG casino's.. it's worth it! Been in different kinds of rooms everytime we go.. i can't decide which one i like the best! there's one w/ a huge tub.. this year we stayed at one w/ a &quot;living room&quot; (couch and tv) bedroom didnt' have a door tho. so can't have guests . lol
4,376,"Good value at the heart of the strip	I had read mixed reviews and even was advised by a friend not to stay at the Imperial Palace, however I got a great flight/hotel deal so I thought I would give it a go. We arrived on a Thursday, checked in took about 5 minutes, the walk to our room was about the same. On inspection of the room, I even checked for bed bugs, the only thing that was lacking was there was little bits of hairs on the bathroom floor. The next day the cleaning lady did clean the bathroom. The hotel is outdated, the restaurants are not worth eating at as you are minutes from much better restaurants such as Margaritaville, etc. The pool is decent but gets packed as it is small. When the weekend hit, the hotel was full and elevator lines did get alittle long, never longer than a 5-10min wait and if you knew your way around the hotel you could find an alternate route to your room but it was tricky, we finally mastered a shortcut on day 3. The location is ideal, there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel. If you are not planning on spending in the hotel and instead outside enjoying the strip then this hotel will suit your needs. If you are looking for a hotel that you want to stay and play without having to leave, then upgrade to a different hotel!"
5,376,"Bed Bugs At Imperial Las Vegas Beware	I stayed for 6 nights, the second night I was itching and about the third or fourth day I showed the cleaning lady and was told lady that I must have developed allergies as I showed her my back and legs. I was in agony for the week and asked for new sheets, blanket, bedspread, each day would ask for something new. Her and I looked for some sign and saw nothing. I came home saw my MD the very next day and he said it was bed bug bites. I called the hotel and they are looking into it. I wanted them to stop renting the room out and refund money. They have not responded as yet. They were shocked I did not let a manager know at the hotel!!! How many people are sabby to bed bugs and the cleaning lady said no, it is allergies that I must have just developed them. Besides I did not want any man to see me, I was so embarrased that I even complained to the cleaning lady and showed her all my bites and clawing I did to my self to try to get relief. Not to shy to post them as to help someone else. How do you tell your friends OH I GOT BED BUGS."
6,376,"Cheap rate good location nothing more.	Booked IP for a quick one-night stay at a very low rate. Wasn't expecting much, but still disappointed. Probably the most uncomfortable bed I've every experienced. The room, hallways, and casino were worn and dirty. Front desk staff and casino personnel all seemed fairly competent. But I would've been miserable here for an extended stay. Tip: If you stay here, request a room far away from the Rockhouse Bar, otherwise you'll be hearing thumping bass until early morning."
7,376,"Hey it's Vegas..............gotta love it!	Hey we just got back from Vegas and had a wonderful time. Six of us went and stayed at the Imperial Palace. 4 of us had a regular room but friends who are repete customers had a comped penthouse! The staff are great, rooms are comfy and clean and they restaurants were good. You can't beat the location and the price. We were in town Sunday when the CFL was playing the West &amp; East finals for Grey Cup. GO RIDERS! The Wynn said they would play the game for us in the sports bar.......NOT.......The Mandalay Bay had a conference of 2000 Canadians staying there and would not play the game either. We asked the RockHouse at the IP and they said you bet. They had 4 tvs going, 2 for 1 drinks specials for us and treated us like royalty!Thry are aslso going to play the Grey Cup this Sunday for anyone donwn there. Go see them they are a great bunch! Annie was out waitress and she even wore a Rider Jersey!Go see Terry Fador at the Mirage, he is a great showman and lots of fun!I would go back to the IP, I liked the sixe of the place, we are treated well and enjoyed being right in the middle of everything!"
8,376,"Nov 25 2009 	Imperial Palace - ho hum	Room was decent, low cost, but noisy because of outdoor bar next door till 1 am. Requested a king got 2 doubles. Casino had a lot of smoking, cheesey lip sinkers. Central location."
9,376,"Nov 24 2009 	Nothing fancy but good price and location	Clean, but very average rooms. Good water pressure in the shower. Best of all, it's very cheap, and is right in the middle of the Strip, near the Flamingo and across from Caesar's Palace. A good place to stay if you just want somewhere to sleep. There's also a Monorail stop.One word of caution: get a room away from the Strip side of the building. There's live music outside until the wee hours, and it's as though the band is right there with you in the room. We checked in at 2am, covered our ears, and immediately went back to the front desk. It was no problem getting a new room."
10,376,"Nov 22 2009	Worked out great!	We were at the IP as part of a group and had 139 room nights. So we got a picture of the good, bad and evil of the IP. First you have to remember that everything in Vegas is priced upon LOCATION. Being at the center of the strip cost more than being well off strip. The buffet at the IP is $25 for the whole day, but yet go 5 miles to a Boulder Highway Casino and eat all day for less than 10 bucks. And neither are any more than some red meat and a lot of chicken products with a salad. So when it comes to food, get out and explore to find bargains and variety. This is an OLD hotel. Period. You can feed an old dog steak and it is still an old dog. Rooms will have the smells of the last 40 yrs. Carpets will be worn. Water flow will be strange. Elevators will stop working. These are just facts, so except them because of the location and price. I am sure some people were happier than others. But the only whine I heard from our group about the rooms was rough toilet paper. (Duh, bring your own to ANY hotel) And bird poop on the balcony. Yes bird pop outside, what a surprise! I was impressed to even have a balcony for each room. I was not impressed by the size of the rooms, as I was at Harrahs or even Ballys. Tuscany wins that battle hands down on room size, but again location and cost are a factor. I twice called security about elevators being out of service and one was fixed quickly, one never did work in my 10 day visit. But I did locate all the hidden elevators and never had much of a wait. There will be noise inside and outside the hotel. This is Vegas, a town that never sleeps and gives away free drinks. Just deal with it as a fact. The desk clerks did a fine job as well as the group room sales office, Robert Coppola. You can always expect a few bumps when you deal with so many rooms and so many people. The maid service was great and responded quickly when asked for extra services. All the employees where nice and made us feel that our business was welcomed. Shaun Tracy the Midwest Regional Sales Manager for Las Vegas Meetings by Harrahs exceeded his duties and went beyond the call of duty to see that we had a great time and all at a decent price.  Over all with price and location our group will be back soon!"
11,376,"Nov 21 2009 	you get what you pay for	clearly, Las Vegas epitomizes &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. You pay a little for a cheap room, you get a cheap room. No bargains found in this town during our stay !Having said that, we wanted a decent room on the strip so we could walk around, day or night. After reading reviews of other hotel rooms in the $30 range, I have to say that the Imperial Palace wasn't too bad. Although the wallpaper was peeling and the furniture obviously had not been wiped down for years, it wasn't too filthy. The room was large enough for the two of us. The bed was a bit saggy but not uncomfortably so.I think the property is a bit rundown - some of the elevators weren't working and it surprised me that we had to call the maintenance staff because they were unaware of the problem ! You always get the impression that someone is watching all of the casino operations 2/7, but this didn't seem to be true !The best part of our stay was the 2-for-1 coupon to Matsuri for hotel guests. It was a good show for $30 .... then, on our way out, we found another coupon in the vegas to go book, so I guess it wasn't an exclusive saving ! if you can get a room here for under $50, I think I would have to recommend it. Circus Circus is a bit far away ....... so the location of the Imperial Palace is what recommends it the most. If you pay more than that for a dumpy room, I'd have to say you got ripped off."
12,376,"Nov 20 2009 	HATED IT... DIDNT EVEN STAY THE SECOND NIGHT	me and my boyfriend stayed at the imperial palace and it was like staying in the ghetto of AC. We opened the window and we were staring at a brick wall. The room smelled like cigarettes, and wasn't even attached to the lobby we had to haul all of our to the back o the hotel out into a dark alley and up 5 flights of stair into a motel in the back parking lot. NO RESTAURANT WORTH EATING AT, NO DANCE CLUBS, HORRRRRIBLE IMPERSONATOR PERFORMANCES, AND HIDDEN FEE'S WHEN YOU CHECK OUT.THE SECOND NIGHT WE CHECKED OUT AND STAYED AT THE MONTE CARLO WHICH WAS ONLY 3% MORE A NIGHT-TOTALLY WORK THE EXTRA 20 BUCKS however Imperial Palace didn't even refund my money for the nights we canceled. RIP OFFFFF."
13,376,"Nov 20 2009	Very tired Hotel	I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of the West Coast area USA. The exterior of the hotel is very off putting and quite seedy, having a large disco/bar in front of the hotel. The rooms are very tired and although they were clean, the whole experience of staying there was not pleasant. The noise outside could be heard in a lot of the rooms allocated to our group. I did not eat in the hotel but used tthe buffet in the Caesars Palace Hotel which is across the road and, although not the cheapest, is very good . The only redeeming feature for this hotel is its location, which is right in the centre of the Las Vegas Strip."
14,376,"Nov 20 2009 	Great value	This was my second stay at the IP. If you're a person who needs frills in a hotel, this isn't the place for you. If you want a good basic room in a great location, then this is an excellent choice. You can't beat the price for a location like that.The room was clean and comfortable. The shower was slow to drain but so's my one at home so that didn't bother me. I didn't have that problem during my previous stay so it might just be that particular room.The main minus are the legendarily slow elevators. They're as bad as you may have heard. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay. The staff are friendly, The room was clean. Plenty of towels and good hot water. The bed was comfortable. The TV is the old bulky style but it worked well and has a pretty good selection of channels.There's a good variety of slot machines and the dealertainers are fun to watch. The internet connection was great, cheaper than at the other hotel I stayed at and much more reliable. Another plus is that the IP is very generous with comps and rate reductions even for those of us who are low rollers. This is not a fancy hotel. If you want frills and such, this is not the hotel for you. If, on the other hand, you just want a basic room with friendly staff and clean, comfortable accomodations, then consider staying at the IP. It has a great location in easy walking distance of several other casinos and attractions and the bus line."
15,376,Nov 19 2009 	THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!! DONT WORRY!!!	What Can I say but wow!!! I just got back from las vegas I have stayed at many places there. I found a great deal for this hotel. This hotel is Great!!! my room was very clean!! Staff was great!! Really dont worry about bad reviews these people are nutz!!! Check in was fast!! We ate in the buffet it was 25.00 and you can eat all day go back and forth as much as you want all day!!! Food and service was great!!! At night had great seafood etc. the prime rib was great!!!! You really cant beat this deal!! Oh ya one vip thing to remember when you check in dont get a room by the night club the clerk at front desk told us that part of hotel was very loud. They gave us a pool view room on the 15th floorgreat view!! And do not get the capri rooms they are in very back of hotel those are the dumpy ones!!! Anyway I had a great stay I will be back I already booked for feb. 2010!!!!
16,376,"Nov 18 2009 	5th time there	but probably the last. Everything was the same there but maybe I am getting older and ready to pay more for a nicer place. I had a friend stay at the Mirage for not much more and that hotel is so much nicer and almost as good location. so after staying there 5 times over the last 5 years here are the negatives and positives.negatives-Pool- not really a Vegas pool more like an Apartment complex poolThe great value of the hotel brings rif raf that stays there- so much less eye candy than other hotels- but still great people watching- don't get me wrong still a safe placeElevators are minimal/small and way too slowBuffett is awfulShows are awfulCasino is small, ceilings are low and its way too smokyTables are old and dirty and the other games are datedBurger palace and the pizza place are horriblePositives-Service has always been goodValue is greatLocation cannot be beat you can get to a lot of hotels in 5 minutes - where if you stayed at the Wynn you could only get to their parking garage in 5 minutesDealertainers are funny and entertaining-- i still miss Louis Armstrong-- he was greatBetties little snack shack looks old but good little bagel and pastriesClose to Harrah's so you can steal their free WIFI so I think this is a pretty good desciption of the place that is fai. Like I said I came back 5 times-- I stayed at the Excalibur once but preferred the location of the IP. I wouldn't object to going back based on the value but I just think I am ready to pay a little more for a little nicer place- I would like to enjoy my next hotel a little more than just a place to sleep so I can get up and go to another property. The IP will always be a part of me though"
17,376,Nov 18 2009 	DON'T BE MISSLEAD	i have read all the bad reviews about the I P and the last time i was here (3yrs ago2 SEE THE CARS ) i would have agreed BUT THEY GAVE A GR8 DEAL so i went w/ low expectations but they have done a gr8 job making this place over the room was nice the staff was nice &amp; helpful a little construction here &amp; there but that says 2 me we are trying to give this old girl a makeover and i think they are doing a GR8 JOB no this is not the Paris OR CEASARS but a good value!!! the only complaint was the buffet was bad(25$all day eats) one of the worst i've had they served the lunch menu along w/ breakfast (7am)that does not give much confidence about lunch we 8 lunch but that was all we could take we skipped dinner (lucy the server was fast&amp;very good at her job)lucy was the best part of the buffet too bad she didn't cook !!! in closing the i.p is a nice value hotel casino w/ a very bad buffet stay here but eat another buffet
18,376,"Nov 18 2009 	not the best place on the strip but great location and good value for money	Hi EveryoneI was dreading staying in this hotel after reading everyones review but this was third time in Vegas so I wasn't really bothered where I stayed after all its just a bed and roof over my head is all I was after!!Im glad I stayed their!!! Its perfect location and CHEAP!!! Don't let others opinion worry you. Its not the best place but my room (and 3 other rooms where my friends was staying) were all clean and spacious, no roaches as others states! but for the price i paid 3 days for $89 dollars what do you expect ??? Venetian!!!!!!!! You get what you pay for!!! Lift was slow but it never bothered me I never waited longer than 5 mins the only thing I would have like and this is personal choice is having a safe in the room!!!Honestly, Its not that bad and for what you pay its perfect!!!! ITS CLEAN!!! Its like paying for easyjet flight and expecting BA service get real!!!!!!!!!Buffet was ok but Embers restaurant was fantastic!!! 3 course meal for $29 dollars.Hope this helps"
19,376,"Nov 18 2009 	vegas baby	we had an awsome time at the imperial palace, there was a dealer ther card dealer that is that never forgot a name and he aslo was from north dakota made our trip great"
20,376,"Nov 17 2009 	good location but getting a bit run down	This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel it is clean ,and is in very good location in the centre of the strip. It is also a stop for the monorail which is handy . The hotel itself although clean is getting run down bathrooms could do with upgrading The whole place could do with a coat of paint. I also felt the buffet didn't have such a wide choice this year. There aren't enough lifts to cope at peak times, you can wait up to 10/15 mins sometimes. As my has walking difficulties we were forced to wait rather than use stairs . They are also now charging to use gym 10 dollars for 30 mins which is a rip off .They have outside cocktail bar which my wife and i were refused access as we didn't have id consdering i am fifty and paying guest i find that situation terrible so for these rasons i will not be back"
21,376,"Nov 17 2009 	Good location	Basically as you all know you get what you pay for.The Imperial palace is cheap and cheerful but its location is amazing as it is central on the strip. This was my first trip to Vegas and although a bit unsure at first quickly got into the spirit of the place.You are here to drink, gamble and enjoy yourself. The Rock Bar just at the front of the Imperial palace always has a great has a great atmosphere and is a bit more laid back than some of the other bigger clubs.The best bit about this hotel is that you are not too far away from anything. The price is worth the location but if you are looking for something bang up to date you may want to try out some of the slightly more expensive hotels like TI or the Mirage."

23,376,"Nov 16 2009 	Well at least we saved money	I have been a member of Harrah's Gold Rewards for over 20 years, and I have to say that I have NEVER had a stay as bad as this one in any of the Harrahs hotel/casinos. The room was okay, clean, and they gave me the extra coffee that I requested. The Dcor was straight out of the 80's  mirror on the ceiling and everything.Negative #1 -We went to find something to eat - granted it was 11pm, but this is Vegas and we are at a casino - but finding food was a joke. The hotel's after hours food choices are the Burger Palace or Ginseng 3. Bad choices since we can't eat burgers and don't like Korean, Japanese &amp; Chinese foods. So we were forced to go out on the strip to find something to eat.Negative #2 - The coffees we ordered from the Cocktail Waitress were watery and almost cold. We don't drink and only order water and/or coffee (and yes, we do tip the Cocktail Waitress).Negative #3 - Hard to find &quot;Non-Smoking&quot; sectionNegative #4 - The next morning we went to take our showers and were surprised to find that there are no hand holds to assist in getting in or out of the large Roman Luv Tub, especially since you had to climb into it to shower.Negative #5 - The next afternoon after we returned to our room for a rest, we found that although the bed was made, the rest of the room wasn't clean. The garbage wasn't emptied, the coffee pot was not cleaned &amp; emptied, no fresh coffee, dirty counters, etc. We called down and talked to housekeeping about the problem, and they seemed to have an attitude that I was bothering them with a trivial matter. When we returned later that evening, we found that they emptied the coffee pot, wiped the bathroom counter and that was it. Garbage was still in the trash cans, paper bits were still on the carpet (i.e. not vacuumed), etc.I could go on, but suffix to say that I am writing to Harrahs about this experience."
24,376,"Nov 16 2009 	Good Location and very reasonable	We stayed at the IP from Nov 7th thru the 14th. The hotel is nothing fancy, but for the location and cheap price, it cant be beat. If you are like us and just want a clean place to sleep, then the IP is for you. If you want more of a upscale hotel, then I would look else where."
25,376,"Nov 15 2009 	Poor very noyse expensive.	They put us in a room without soundproof, we couldn't sleep at the first night, then we asked to change. They tell us is a 4 star hotel but for me, was a 2 star one."
26,376,"Nov 14 2009 	We will stay there again	We booked a deluxe room under a special mid-week promotional rate (three nights -- $89!). Our room (#1330) was clean, comfortable, quiet, short walk to elevators, not luxe by any means, but met every requirement for moderate-cost accommodations and had lots of big plush towels! Fantastic fantastic location on the Strip. We had some facilities issues (slow draining toilet and shower) but called the desk and an engineer showed up within 15 minutes with his rolling toolkit to solve the problems. We needed wi-fi which is available for an extra $10/day -- it performed flawlessly. Hotel staff was helpful not intrusive. Elevators were a little slow at times. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants -- but used the coupon book we were given on check-in to dine at the Flamingo, Paris, and Harrah's -- all right up the street. The Imperial Palace is an east walk, as well, to Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Venetian, Ballys and Mirage."
27,376,"Nov 14 2009 	wedding nightmare in vegas	I searched online for the perfect wedding chapel inside a hotel because i was told you have a better experience if they are connected to a casino hotel. I am familiar with Harrahs and believed them to be top notch with their properties and treatment of guests.The wedding planner was very nice and helpful the entire time while making arrangements and planning the wedding so I felt confident my first and only wedding would be wonderful, we booked our rooms at the IP along with the maid of honor, best man, and grooms parents, and sister and brother in law...when we arrived my wedding dreams began to fall apart...we had been told we could choose the background for the chapel that was not true, we did not receive the runner or flower petals down the aisle, we were told they had a selection of music to choose from for our first dance, they didnt have it available for us so we gave them 2 song choices and asked to be called if they didnt have them, the day of my wedding i asked which song we were going to have, never got an answer and it ended up being a song I had never heard, and the minister anounced it as our last dance. the way everything reads I believed the toast was included as part of ceremony and would be on dvd, it isnt they had our sparking cider and broken glasses in a bag for us to take like party favors. the wedding planner was aware that my parents are deceased, and reminded when we arrived because they asked about them and I broke down in tears...it was very hard to get married w/out my my and dad...the day of my wedding the photorapher kept asking where my mom was for pics in the brides room...then even when i said my parents weren't coming they were dead he proceeded to have the grooms mom stand up saying he thought she was my mom. the wedding planner wouldnt let the best man and maid of honor sign the certificate because it had to be ledgible. She then proceeded to put the grooms name in the witness spot so our certificate is full of white out.the minister was cracking jokes, it didnt seem appropriate as we had not even met him before the ceremony...I found out his name by reading our marriage lisence.We were mislead by the wedding planner on how many picture we were atually getting in our package and afterwards found out why no one was allowed to take any pics in the chapel...the photograher's packages were expensive.the wedding planner set up appointments for myself and my maid of honor at the salon located inside IP for hair updo and makeup before the wedding $250.00 for that seemed high but hey it was my weding day and we should be pampered right...well they ended up charging us an extra $112.00 saying we didnt get basic updo...by the way my maid of honor had to redo both our hair because I didnt even get off the elevator and my tiarra fell out and curls were gone, hers were falling too...The Princess wedding chapel did nothing to compensate us for our disaterous wedding.Our room at the IP was a deluxe so we actualy got a one cup coffee maker, but only enough coffee for one cup, we are 2 adults who drink coffee, the maid did find us a little more one day but told us they were out so we had to go buy coffee and rig a filter in order to have coffee...we were lucky because the regular rooms do not even get a coffeemaker so our family had to either come to our room in the morning or set off to find and buy coffee.the faucet in our luv tub didnt work properly couldnt get hot water to come out so had to haul water from the shower in the bathroom to fill it and then the faucet wouldnt turn off so we had a trickle going, the doors on the closet were off the track my husband had to keep fixing then everytime we needed to get into it, the sliding glass door was hard to open and kept going off track too"
28,376,"Nov 14 2009 	a bit disappointed	Was there for a week and upon returning i found that my digital camera was missing. I left it in my room and never used it .

33,376,"Nov 11 2009 	Great choce  but you kind of got to know how to work it>>>>	This was our 22nd Las Vegas trip and our 5th stay at the IP. We have stayed at many hotels there, and we keep coming back here. The location cannot be topped. head out the front door , and you are within walking distance to most of the great things this city offers.We were comped a king suite , but we have stayed in a deluxe room, and they are ok as well. My recommendation is that you can pay for a king suite for about the same price as a standard room at Mirage, or TI , and have a much larger room with more amenities. Our room had a sitting room, king bed. oversized tub, wet bar with a refrigerator, and yes.....a coffee maker. The biggest gripe you will read about staying there is that the IP is the home of the planets slowest elevators. This honor is well earned, but the knowlegable guest learns that there is a second bank of lifts around the back and to the loft of the main bank. Few people seem to know about these , and the wait is not as bad. Also the front elevators seem to not have as much traffic and you can walk back to your foom on you home floor after using them. This is particularly handy if you are toting luggage.The restaurants there are not the best in town, The Embers steakhouse is ok, and the coffee shop is good for a breakfast, or a light lunch. Room service is great for breakfast. ( used it every day) although a little slow. The Burger Palace and the buffet are to be avoided at all costs. The staff there is great, and the casino hosts are among the best in the business. The front desk and the valet staff are friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this hotel for the first time Las Vegas visitor, but for the guest who knows his way around, it has got to be the best value on the strip."
34,376,"Nov 11 2009 	Like sleeping in a parking garage	Recently stayed from October 26-30th There are two very different sides to this hotel, the main part of the building which must be relatively ok and rooms in a separate building (The Capri Building) about a 20 minute walk away through the carpark which are like sleeping in the carpark. We heard televisions through the walls, EVERYBODY'S conversations as though walls didn't exist, fights in the car park, car alarms here and there and twice had people trying to get into our room in the 3:30-5:00am Had to call security twice to break up an argument of drunk college guys outside our room at 4:30 in the morning (they never turned up) Housekeeping also 'forgot our room' twice in four days and no, the 'do not disturb' wasn't on the door.As regular business traveller I have stayed at literally thousands of hotels at all levels of luxury to economy. I understand people don't go to Vegas to sleep but we stayed for 4 days and reasonable expected to sleep at some stage.We turned on the heater (during a particular cold front that came through) to have the whole room fill with an electric fire and burnt dust smell.It's centrally located and they have celebraity look-a-likes dealing cards. That's the best I've got."
35,376,"Nov 10 2009 	This place is a DUMP	We thought we had a great deal - airfare &amp; 4 nights hotel for $325. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. This place is an absolute DUMP. We had paid for 4 nights and left after 2. The only thing missing was cockroaches. Water backed up in the sink &amp; tub, hairdryer didn't work (nice to find out when you're standing there with a dripping head of hair), grimy room decor straight out of the 80's, beds HARD AS ROCK, towels as soft as a wire loofah, air conditioning sounded like a 747 landing..... and on and on and on. And the FOOD in the restaurants! Overpriced and disgusting. Yup, this place is a DUMP. We moved after 2 nights to the Tuscany Suites &amp; Casino about a half mile off the strip - FABULOUS! A suite that was 4 times the size of the dump at the Imperial Palace, brand new, beautiful, quiet grounds and staff that just could not do enough for us. Saturday night cost us $79 and Sunday night cost us $35!!!!"
36,376,"Nov 10 2009 	Another Perfect Vacation With Imperial Palace	This is our 4th stay at imperial palace with the value and customer service on all of our visits it won't be the last. We arrived early as always they got us right into a room 4 hrs early, i asked for a room with a view. Our room was right over the pool great view but a little loud for us. I went to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms 5 minutes later and no trouble at all we were in a new room. My wife takes mecidation that needs to be kept cold so they comp. us a fridge in our room for the entire 6 night stay. The maid service was impeccable everything was spotless and plenty of towels. (don't forget to leave a few dollars for the maid it will be well appreciated) Room service took literally 10 minutes and was HOT and FRESH. And best of all we checked out on our tv and didn't pay any attention to the price a few days later reviewing my visa statement we realized they charged us $100 less than our reservation price, when i inquired why i was told they automatically change your reservation to the lower price. Well appreciated surprise. just to let you know what a great deal this was i payed $202 for a 6 night stay (including saturday) and room service once. Excellent visit we visit every 4 months as its such a great value we can strech our vacation budget alot further. A++++++++++++++++++++"
37,376,"Nov 9 2009 	People are hard to please	Just returned from a 6 night stay, our first time at this hotel and too be honest I cannot see what all the fuss is about.I did not have any blood on the walls or vomit on the carpet, no probs with the plumbing although it did take awhile for the water to drain after a shower but other than that it was fine.Staff were friendly and helpful, room was always cleaned when we returned, never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift ( or as our Americans cousins refer to them &quot;elevators&quot;) which usually had chatty and friendly Americans in them.We tried the emporers buffet and to be honest quite enjoyed it, one of the few places in Vegas that offered value in my opinion.In all honesty for the price you pay I think it is a great hotel and despite the fact that our last trip to Vegas was to a 5 star hotel I would certainly stay at the Imperial again.Vegas on the other hand I have a lot of complaints about and will not be returning to, I dont feel that this is the place to talk about it but I felt strongly enough to email the Mayor and was flabbergasted when I got a reply, which was very polite but none the less, unless things change dramatically in that town I will not get the opportunity to stay at the Imperial again."
38,376,"Nov 8 2009	GREAT Location and GREAT HOTEL	We stayed at Imperial Palace from October 31, 2009-November 4, 2009. This was our first trip to Las Vegas and we couldn't have asked for a better location on the strip. It was close to everything! Turn right out of hotel and walk to the Venetian, Wynn, and Encore. Turn left and go to Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, and MGM Grand. Caesar's Palace is directly across the street and Bellagio is diagnal. The hotel staff was very friendly and always helpful. Yes the rooms are outdated, but who goes to Las Vegas to stay in their hotel room??!! I requested a room in the back of the hotel away from the strip so it would be quiet for bedtime and I asked for a balcony when we checked in. We were on the 11th floor facing the Flamingo and it was great. You could get $5 pitchers of beer from the casino bar and the Dealertainers were OK. We didn't gamble very much at Imperial because we were always walking around the other hotels so we could see them. Bill's is next door with cheap food and drinks, as well as Casino Royale. Bill's has a discount ticket center which is where we bought tickets to Love by Cirque du Soleil (we paid $80 each for the tickets and had 4th row, normal price I think is $125 each) so if you are looking to see a show definitely stop by there. We ate at Margaritaville which is super close to Imperial, but I wouldn't recommend it. The food is overpriced and wasn't that great. We had lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio (awesome) and dinner one night at BLT Burger in The Mirage (the best burger I have EVER had). The monorail stops at Imperial/Harrah's so that was convenient for getting around. We NEVER had a problem with the elevators. Most of the time we walked right up to it, hit up or down, and it opened right up. Seriously, this is a great hotel for the price and in a fabulous location. When we do go back to Vegas, we'll be staying here again definitely. Hope you have a wonderful trip!"
39,376,"Nov 5 2009 	Basic room but a good bargain	Was able to book a &quot;Deluxe&quot; room in the tower on a non-smoking floor. Room is decorated like a 1990's motel, and is rather dark as the only window is a single sliding door to a little balcony. The elevators have stained carpeting and are a little jerky, and the hallways look anything but upscale. But you can't beat the price. My room was clean and quiet. Was quieter than MGM. Slept well, although the mattress was not terribly comfortable. Nice iron &amp; clean ironing board. My only complaint is there was no safe in the room."
40,376,"Nov 5 2009 	Cheap hotel; cheap clientele. Don't expect much.	We stayed at the IP Oct 30 - Nov 2nd, 2009. Now I read the reviews and kind of knew what to expect. I was expecting a crappy Motel 6 and that is more or less what we got. At least the room was more or less clean. We arrived at 4 am so I just checked the bed for clean sheets and bedbugs and crashed. (There were no bugs by the way.) In the morning I saw some of the issues with the room. The patio door was very hard to open and close. Stained curtains. Tiny tube TV. No safe. The bathroom was worn and pretty clean though the wallpaper was coming off and there was mold on the top edge of the tub and shower surround. Who knew mold could grow there?? There was no lid on the toilet seat either. odd. The room is quite small and the bathroom is also very small. Everything about this place is cheap though. Even the ice buckets are not regular ice buckets, but a cheap plastic bucket printed with the logo. There is not even a pen in the room, you get a tiny golf pencil to write with. Even the toilet paper is the absolute cheapest stuff available. The Bellagio and every other hotel had better TP in their public restrooms. So if you want a cheap place in a good location mid-strip the IP is going to be fine for you. I would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to. We had some noise issues with our neighbors on Fri and Sat nights. I was expecting it though when on Fri and Sat I saw lots of college students and 20 somethings checking in. Their main luggage seemed to consist of cases of beer and beer bongs. So I knew we'd better stay up late cause it would be loud. And it was. We did not eat at the IP at all and I don't think any of the places are good. You can find better food at other nearby casinos that is better and similarly priced. I'm not sure when this place will be torn down or remodeled but it won't be soon enough. Even the Flamingo next door is a lot nicer for only a few bucks more per night."
41,376,Nov 4 2009 	Worst hotel on the strip	Do not stay here - this place is flithy and even after changing rooms 3 times - ended up sleeping in my clothes. They wouldn't even do a refund for the cancellations on the rest of our reservations.
42,376,"Nov 3 2009 	First time and last at The IP	The parking lot is kind of a pain to find. When we went they were having an AARP convention so there was no non-smoking rooms left all thowe i requested one They upgraded me to a mini suit witch was nice. Some one on are floor ordered food to there room after eating it they wheeled the table out in to the hall were it was for the whole trip some one on the last day took the table and put the food plates on the floor next to the door. The smoke smell in the game room was bad. It is in a great location but after walking the whole strip from end to end there are a lot of better hotels for the same or even less money. The pool seams like a nomal back yard pool, nothing like the other hotels. For the first time ever going to vegas it was an okay hotel we were not in it very much. If you go to embers the fine dining place there two people can split a meal very easy. And if you are young like we are expect to be the youngest people there."
43,376,"Nov 3 2009	Very Loud	The rooms are very ok at best. You can hear everyone walking in the hallway at all hours of the day and night, and you would think there are no walls in your room as loud as the music sounded."
44,376,"Nov 3 2009 	A Good trip with a Reasonable and Good Hotel	My husband and I, and his brother and sister-in-law drove down to Vegas at the end of September for a 5 day getaway. It was her first trip to Vegas, his second and our 15th. We hadn't stayed at the Imperial for close to 20 years and were concerned after reading some of the reviews. But I couldn't pass up a $29 a night deluxe room in the middle of the strip. And I am glad I didn't. Great location, excellent service (a drippy faucet fixed after just a quick mention to housekeeping) and a clean, large room at a wonderful price. Sure the Imperial doesn't have the grandeur of some of the other hotels, but we weren't looking for a place where we were afraid to leave a fingerprint. We wanted a good pool, a central location, clean rooms and a decent price. We'll be back!"
45,376,"Nov 2 2009 	Don't Pass this one by	Have been and stayed in Las Vegas for the past 13 years. Needless to say that my husband and I have frequented several hotels. We have stayed in 5 Star down to 3 Star and along with us have seen them either age and pass on or age and be maintained. I don't care what you have read or heard but anyone who tells you not to stay at the Imperial Palace really needs to reevaluate their thinking. Their check in service was fast. The room (a simple deluxe) was both larger and cleaner than some of those that we have stayed in at higher priced hotels. We saw two of the best shows on the strip right in the convenience of the hotel itself and were given discount coupons for the both of them when we arrived. Even the show tickets had several perforated coupons attached to them that we used to receive even further discounts in the hotel restaurants which were not bad at all. The location cannot be beat. Every age group was represented and everyone - guests, hotel workers, etc. - were absolutely friendly. My husband and I were shocked at what we had been missing. It all boils down to attitude. If you go to any hotel with a negative outlook before you get there, then by all means you will have a terrible time. But if you go with a flexable one, then Aha! You will have the great time that we had. By the way - the elevators were A-1, fast or even faster than any other hotel we were in. And it is apparent to us that the Imperial is undergoing some cosmetic changes in that everything was clean and shining. The crowd was hopping and we had a blast. Thank you Imperial. We will return."
46,376,"Nov 1 2009 	Good hotel - great location.	I was pleasntly surprised by the hotel. The location was perfect, there was free parking, the rooms were huge, clean and well equipped and we had a great stay.The casino was buzzing - and the hotel was a great place to explore Nevada &amp; Arizona."
47,376,"Oct 30 2009 	Great location mid-strip serviceable nothing outstanding at all	Stayed here twice and its worked both times b/c of the cheapness and location on the strip. Absolutely no-frills room in the &quot;Capri&quot; area of the hotel, a bit longer of a walk to the strip, but perfect for most vegas trips, because who wants to hang out in the hotel room in vegas? Casino in this hotel is not great...cheap hold em tourneys daily, mostly crowded gaming floor, cheesy dealertainers, food is very average, not that I was expecting much, between harrah's and flamingo, I may not know what I'm missing b/c Ive been to vegas twice and only stayed here, it seems to be one of the main hotels for the cheap airline ticket/hotel package deal. Will prob stay somewhere else next time just to change it up, but have no reason to avoid this hotel either. Very ordinary but not terrible."
48,376,"Oct 30 2009 	This is a great hotel for the value and location.	We stayed for 3 nights, Oct. 16, 17, and 18. Staff was very friendly at check-in and the wait in line was not bad for a Friday night. Our room was very comfortable, everything was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the air conditioner worked great. The cleaning staff was very friendly and would always smile and talk to us in the halls. The casino was nice and it was an easy walk to other casinos on the strip - Location was perfect. When we plan our next trip we will definately consider staying at the Imperial Palace."
49,376,"Oct 29 2009 	Best Value In Vegas	I stayed for 1 week in Oct 09 and would definitely choose to stay there again on a budget trip. I picked the hotel because I needed to do this particular trip on a tight budget but still be mid strip - and it did the job perfectly. Of course the hotel doesn't compare to those that you would be paying 3 or 4 times the price for (which seems to be the main problem for a lot of travellers!), however my own experience was that we got checked in really quickly and got a great room overlooking the pool (I already knew not to go for the strip view rooms if I wanted to sleep). We had a small bank of elevators near our room that we only had a wait for on our checkout morning (and even then only a couple of minutes). Our room (deluxe) was of good size, the bed was comfortable, the shower was great &amp; housekeeping did a great job - the room was always spotless upon our return. In short, this is the best value on the strip if you want to save more money for the many pleasures of Vegas!"
50,376,"Oct 29 2009 	Think twice	I would like to start off with the positives!The staff was great. Dear lord, the buffet was fabulous. I would have to say that having 8 plates of crab legs alone suggests how much I enjoyed the buffet ($18.99 is the correct price and not $16.99 as displayed all throughout the hotel). Being located in the strip was definitely a perk. We were only steps away from the club scene that way the walk back wasn't so bad!!!Yikes and now for the bad and the ugly...Immediately after arriving in a room it only took a few minutes to notice the bites on my feet and legs. Both my friend and I sat on the bed and felt a sudden rush if itching. We went into the light and saw tons of bug bites!!! We asked to have our sheets changed which they immediately were only to have the same thing happen with the new sheets. Ridiculous I tell you! Six torturous days until our return home. Whatever it was that was biting us came home with us! After further investigation our home has now been dianosed with a bed bug infestation! Look it up! They are blood feeding bugs that are easily harbored by clothes, suitcases, etc! I can only speculate where the infestation came from.... I wouldn't suggest staying at this hotel. Definitely a place to eat at!!!"
51,376,"Oct 29 2009 	Luv Tub Nightmare! Horrible Hotel... Ick	I purchased a room for some friends of mine who were driving a long way to meet us in Vegas. Originally we planned to split the costs, and they didn't want an expensive room. My husband and I were staying at the Mirage, but it was booked full. So we thought, this was close - and I figured if I upgraded their room, it might be nicer that the standard rooms (which don't have a great reputation). I was WRONG. Upgrading was a mistake. Their room was actually in the basement, and was filthy. They didn't even bother to empty the ashtray. It smelled like mold and was comparable to a bad &quot;by the hour&quot; motel room. We are not picky people, but my friend ended up asking them to DOWNGRADE her just to get out of that room. Her standard room was 10x better - but still pretty gross. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody (except maybe a $5 hooker) :) Honestly... keep looking."
52,376,"Oct 29 2009 	Best place in Vegas to stay bar none!!!!	I cannot believe some people's reviews of my favourite hotel/casino in Vegas. OK the place is only a 3 star but it's a GREAT 3 star!! The atmosphere in this casino is THEE best of ANY casino in Vegas. I have taken numerous friends to this place and they all love it. The Dealertainers, the poker room, the buffet, the music they play all the time, the bars, the cocktails - this place is absolutely brilliant. I will be there again in 4 weeks time for my 6th visit in 5 years. I cannot recommend this place highly enough if you want to have a good time and not complain about the &quot;chipped paintwork in your room&quot;!! Jeez -how long do you spend in your room? 5 minutes unless your some decrepit old fud. This place is THEE best casino in Vegas for havin' the crack!! (That's fun to you yanks)."
53,376,"Oct 28 2009 	Great price great location better hotels out there	Was my 1st time in Vegas so I knew I wanted a central location, that was key. And price was very important to, since I was travelling alone, I had no one to split the cost with. When I got there, check in took a while but when I finally did get up to the counter, the staff was polite and friendly. I was told the only rooms I requested (1 queen/king) were facing the Carnival Court (a very LOUD outdoor bar that has bands and a DJ until about 3am). My other option was a smoking room. Thankful that he advised me of the possible noise instead of my being surprised, I took the smoking room. I realize I'm in Vegas, but after being out shopping all day and partying all night, I want a quiet room to come back to and get some shut eye. So, off to my smoking room I went.Luckily, I was on the 2nd floor so no elevator needed. Try to get a room as low to ground as you can as the elevators take absolutely FOREVER. I was content with my 2nd floor smoking room every time I walked by the elevators watching people standing there impatiently for easily 15 minutes (I know because when I checked in, I took the elevator, I couldn't get my luggage up the stairs on my own). View from my room - the cement wall of the hotels parking garage. Whatever, that didn't phase me at all. The room was quiet other than the occasional honk from a car in the garage, and that's all that mattered to me. The showers were good, water pressure good, lots of hot water and plenty of fresh linens. The beds were comfy, no complaints. When I did come home though, I had to wash everything in my suitcase because it smelled of smoke. Not a strong smell, but I'm not a smoker, so I noticed it.The buffet restaurant in the hotel - garbage. The breakfast was really bad, the lunch bad but not as bad as breakfast. I ate breakfast at Denny's down the street every morning. Coffee's good, egg's are hot, and it's cheap to, and everyone knows Denny's, so you know what you are getting.The pool is nothing special, but it is there if you want. I spent a couple hours one day lounging by the pool. They had a DJ playing some good music, which I like, and girls walking around taking drink orders.Overall, I'd stay here again, but only if rooms at Harrah's weren't available or were outrageously priced. I'm in Vegas to be out and about, not to hang out in my hotel room, so I'm not one to stay at the more expensive places, these 2 suit me just fine."
54,376,"Oct 28 2009 	Perfect for the price.	If you are looking for somewhere that is cheap, not too basic but not shabby, this is the place. Rooms were fairly large, the only downside is the lifts take forever, but there are lifts at the back of the hotel that nobody uses if you dont mind a little walk. but for value for money, its probably the best place to stay. maybe not ideal for familys or couples, but for a group of lads out to have a good time and save money on sleeping, this is the place to go."
55,376,Oct 28 2009 	Nice Stay	Just recently stayed at Imperial Palace it was clean and not a bad hotel.
56,376,"Oct 28 2009 	Showing its age	A great location on the &quot;Strip&quot;. Facility is aging but adequate and reasonably priced. Like all of Vegas, however, food prices are getting higher with poor service and miserable gaming odds. The cafe serves a great pastery-the &quot;Bearclaw&quot;. Don't miss it.Seems like Vegas has become too big and too crowded with very little value for your money. Where is the next &quot;Old Vegas&quot;?"
57,376,"Oct 27 2009 	Cheap but Decent	The Imperial Palace is definitely no place to write home about, but the rooms are incredibly inexpensive and you cannot beat the location. The staff was friendly and honest. We wouldn't recommend the buffet, however. If you're a 'no frills' type and like to save some dough, this place is for you."
58,376,"Oct 27 2009 	Great location and price but a little rundown	Stayed here because the price was fantastic! Bed was very comfortable and clean, but the toilet was a little rundown and there were dubious stains in the bathtub. No problems with the lift, but yes, like the other reviewers we got lost looking for our room for the first 2 days. We got a room facing the pool, so no problems with noise from The Strip.Location is absolutely fantastic, various types of food outlets, shopping and even a car rental stall all within 15-20mins of walking. Monorail station right at the backdoor too! There was NO in room safe, so we had to lug our laptop with us to the Grand Canyon. Front Desk staff were all very helpful."
59,376,"Oct 27 2009 	Jewel in the rough!	True the rooms aren't that big but it has heart and soul. Had a wonderful time. Will be returning in Dec 2009. Great rates, great location, no problems. Most people when they come to Vegas, really, honestly, just how much time do you spend in your room? I have stayed at other casinos with higher star ratings and had worse rooms for more money."
60,376,"Oct 26 2009	Close to casinos	The room they gave me at first was only partly cleaned. The bed was made, but there was trash still in the bins and used towels on the bathroom floor. Reception was very helpful and gave me a different room without troubles, and this time it was clean. The Imperial is close to the rest of the casinos on the strip, however, in a large place like this one has to expect to do some walking to get to places. Would have had to pay for using internet in the room, which I didn't."
61,376,"Oct 24 2009 	Dirt cheap great location if you just want a comfortable place to sleep!	Right on the strip across from Caesar's. We paid $20/night for a Mon-Thur stay. The room was clean but not fancy by any means, reminds me of a Comfort Inn or similar. Our floor was quiet (when we were there). Bed was surprisingly comfortable, even better than a Marriott we stayed at in Flagstaff. If you want luxury, go someplace else. If you want a cheap place to crash, right in the middle of the strip, check the IP."
62,376,"Oct 22 2009 	Not for me	Yep, it is everything that as been said on this site. My fourth time to Vegas (stopped in mgm signature last year), this time went with mate, who unfortunately was on a very tight budget. For me, coming back each night to this place,became more depressing each visit. We found staff to be pleasant, &amp; our deluxe(refurb'd) bedroom to be acceptable........ BUT the rest of the place ?????. Listen, if you dont mind classless/tastless/darkness! &amp; can put up with all i have mentioned, then go for it. Showed my mate Gold Coast Hotel (cheaper/just off strip) he now wishes we had stopped there &amp; got the free shuttle bus daily. People who say the dealertainers are good......... must have been seeing different to what we saw, but ey, each to there own, personally i have never seen worse. Have now finished with Vegas, but it is a place i nothing but fond memories about,(except one place) &amp; believe everybody should visit here at least once in there lifetime"
63,376,"Oct 22 2009 	Read for a true review - Stay away	A request for a room close to the elevators for a handicapped guest who has difficulty walking leads to a room assignment of the LAST room at the end of the hallway- the furthest away from the bank of elevators. Wallpaper peeling off the wall Dirty carpets Worn furniture and bedding A bathroom sink so worn the enamel is almost none existent A bathroom tub that takes almost an hour to drain after a shower A bathroom tub that drains to well from the floor above into a guest room across the hallway at 4:30 A.M. - check your records on 10/13 - creating a disturbance to all guest as shop vacs and workers endeavored to clean up the mess ! The later explanation given by one of your supervisors (according to his name tag) was that the Oriental people use the bathtubs to do laundry and that they left the water running. Hence the name Imperial Palace I guess !Noise...Noise...Noise...Noise.Only 4 elevators that run about as fast as dirt - leading to guests waiting 25 to 30 abreast and 10 to 12 deep and pushing and shoving when a car finally arrives at the casino level. People wedging open fire doors to stairways with room towels rather than waiting for these elevatorsA blinking message light on the phone in the room leads to a message stating that there are no messages in your Meridian voicemail . There were however 18 long stem roses for an 80th birthday celebration that were never delivered-that this message was supposed to refer to. Only when the sender called and asked about his gift, were we made aware that your staff had tossed a package clearly marked FTD live flowers into the back room and they would send someone to look for it.A parking garage that requires a GPS system to reach...up...down elevators and escalators and a 5 minute hike...ridiculous !Being propositioned by hookers in your shopping areaWatching your security guards escort one of these ladies off the premises as another one -tossed out not 15 minutes before walks right past them and back into the hotel !!! Check your security log at 6 A.M on 10/15"
64,376,"Oct 22 2009 	If you need cheap it's a good clean one.	older style hotel, clean rooms and casino is alright. nightlife is limited and it a little ways off the stip so you need to do some walking to get to anywhere good. you get what you pay for and at least this one is clean."
65,376,"Oct 20 2009 	Horrible!!!! Disgusting!!!	Our room was not clean at all. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The sink had tooth paste in it as well as the cap to a needle from the people before us. The toilet had crusty stuff all over the seat and the tank. VERY GROSS!!! The bathtub hadn't been cleaned either. We didn't even have a shower curtain, it was a bed sheet with holes cut in it. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I will NEVER step foot in the Imperial Palace again."
66,376,Oct 20 2009 	affordable	The hotel is not really easy to access on the strip. You can see it from the strip but the entrance is quite hard to find. Room service was a bit slow but it was during spring break week. Room was roomy. Overall I would stay there again.
67,376,"Oct 20 2009 	Great stay for the $$$	The hotel was very nice, taking the cost into consideration. We were looking for a nice, clean place to rest at night. We got that and much more. The room, while small, served our needs very nicely. We heard no noise from the strip or the casino below and the A/C functioned just fine. RE: Hotel/Casino Staff- My wife dropped a small coin purse of some sentimental value with her TR card and a small amount of cash in it in the casino. While we had pretty much written off the hope of finding it again, especially w/ $$ in it, we were about to head out to the shuttle pick-up area when we heard a page for my wife to return to the security booth. A staff member had located the purse and turned it in to security. Still had the card and the cash in it!!! A perfect end to a fantastic trip!!!"
68,376,"Oct 20 2009 	Rooms that are an incredible value that are located at the center of the Strip!	My husband and I stayed at the Imperial Palace (IP) October 6 - 11. It was our second stay at the IP within 6 months and we are very pleased with it and will certainly stay there again. Our room this time had been remodeled and was always very clean with a comfortable bed. The IP is located in the center of the strip which is close to the Venetian, Mirage, Caesars, the Flamingo, Harrahs, etc. The food choices at the IP are not great but just go out the door and you are just steps away from many wonderful restaurants and great shopping. We use the money that we save by staying at the IP to see the shows and eat at the better restaurants in Vegas. This is Vegas - - we are always out on the town and are only in our hotel room to sleep. Believe me, it is an incredible value!"
69,376,Oct 19 2009 	Underated Harrahs property	Good central location to stay while you are in Vegas. The rooms are not that big but they were upkept quite well. I would stay here again if anything for the nice location near Caesars and the Mirage.
70,376,"Oct 19 2009 	Needs to be updated!	Imperial Palace is in a great location, but the rooms are totally out dated, the pool is nice too, but in October the sun dont shine on the pool for very long. I dont think I would stay there again!"
71,376,Oct 19 2009 	NEVER again!!	First of all this &quot;Palace&quot; is NOT a Palace. My now husband and I booked our trip almost 7 months in advance. When we arrived at this dump they had our reservations all wrong and we ended up in a room that we didn't book. Our room over-looked a beautiful parking garage! When we got to our room the rugs were filthy - the bathroom was absolutely disgusting!! We went to Vegas just to get married and have the Vegas wedding we always wanted - but this hotel almost ruined our trip! We had family travel with us as well for the wedding and their room had the pipes literally fall apart and spew black crud all over their bathroom which happened the day of our wedding and caused us to be late meeting our limo and late getting to our chapel! When you walked out the doors of the casino it constantly smelled like sewage! The rest of the hotel was dark and dingy and you had to wait FOREVER to get an elevator and when an elevator would finally show up it was usually jam packed and you had to wait for another and another. We would take the steps down to the casino floor but you could not take the steps back up to your room because the doors were locked! A friend ordered us room service for our wedding and we only received half of the order and our friends needed to be reimbursed! We ate at the 24 hr burger joint which was very filthy and my husband and I both got extremely ill immediately after. It was a horrible experience and I would never stay there again nor would I recommend this place to my worst enemy!
72,376,"Oct 18 2009 	Fantastic!!! Don't let other reviews sway you.	Booked this trip, trying to save a little money and still be in the middle of things on the strip. This hotel is quite a jewel!!!!! excellant location, great price, and very clean!!! Our room was on the 18th floor of the tower and it was just perfect. We never had a problem with the tub backing up, or the toilet not working as stated in some of the other reviews!!The staff was very helpful and friendly I would definitely stay here again. Check in was also easy no lines at all. So dont let the bad reviews keep you away it is a good clean place to stay without spending a fortune!!!"
73,376,Oct 16 2009 	Great Place	Had read reviews and were not sure about staying at the IP. We loved the place. Its located in the middle of the strip and close to everything. Will stay again.
74,376,"Oct 14 2009 	Great value on the strip	The hotel is conveniently on the center of Las Vegas strip with monorail service and a shuttle bus service from the airport for only $6-6.50. This is a great hotel if you are on a budget with clean rooms and prompt service. I stayed on the 17th floor (17106) with double queen size beds. There was no view from this side, just to let you know. The non smoking room was great. They also have smoking rooms.There is also a pool and jacuzzi open 9am-5pm and the jacuzzi i think is 24 hours. but the pool area is open for sun bathing all day. The weather there was an average of 30 degrees celsius. You go through the casino lobby to get through to your room. it's always smoky and loud. I checked out the show, Cirque du Soleil, La Reve at Wynn Hotel. Third row seat for $80. Great show, not to be missed. Check out the Caesar's Palace Hotel mall right across Imperial Palace. You must go through different hotels, even just to check it out. You can use the monorail to take you around quickly and it costs $14 for the whole day. The Grand Canyon is worth the trip to Vegas alone. Although, I went to a much smaller version of that in Red Rock. I think it's about $5 to get in. Really great if you have kids because the hike is not strenuous. I stayed at the hotel with my bro, and my cousin. We're in our mid 20's. Las Vegas is great with the right people to go with, of course. But there's something in it for everyone alike. Have fun."
75,376,"Oct 13 2009 	Better then we expected	After reading other reviews we were a little uneasy about our decision to stay here, but for the price we decided to stay with it and we are so glad that we did. When we arrived and checked in we were offered an upgrade to a suite with a huge tub! We took it and could not have been happier. The staff was helpful and friendly. I have seen many complaints about the elevator but we had no trouble at all during our stay. The rooms were a little outdated however they were clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the side of the building so the music from the stage was not a problem at all. The location is perfect and with the monorail station in the hotel you can get almost anywhere on the strip fast. The shopping in the hotel is some what limited but there are so many choices nearby. The casino was smaller and much less intimidating then some of the others we visited. We did visit the buffet once and were not very impressed but again with so many other choices it was not a huge drawback. We will be staying at the Imperial Palace the next time that we visit and we can't wait. We also had friends join us who were able to book a room at the last second and were also extremely pleased. If you are looking for a great deal and a very decent place to stay this is a good bet, if you are looking for one of the big resorts keep looking and be willing to pay for it."
76,376,"Oct 13 2009 	Not the classiest of hotels but very central and great entertainment	Stayed 29th Sept to 6th oct.Although this is not the classiest of hotels in vegas, it is right in the middle of the strip so less walking for you to do dependent which side of the strip you want to go.And the hotel does have a nice atmosphere with its Dealertainers - ie the croupiers will get up and sing - some mime (badly) but others are really quite good. Can be a bit loud at times especially in the morning when wake up after a few drinks.Have to say the rooms although basic were kept very clean and no matter what time of day I left my room when I cam back it would have been cleaned and new towels etc been replaced. Try not to get a room outside the car park though as every now and again the car alarms would go off (not sure why that may be??)Drinks in this hotel also seem to be a lot cheaper. For example 2 Vodka and Tonics would cost you $11 in the Imperial Palace but other hotels in excess of $20.Overall a good trip. If you want to go to Vegas on a budget then this is the place for you, but if you like a bit more of the creature comforts in life then perhaps try Ceasers palace of Mandalay Bay The Hotel - very very nice :-))Croupiers are very friendly and you can have a laugh and a joke with them while you"
77,376,"Oct 12 2009 	OK for the price and location	The Imperial is centrally located in the middle of the strip's action.The price is reasonable.It is dated and a little &quot;frumpy and frayed&quot;.Definitely has a &quot;funk&quot; factor.The layout is very confusing -you can't get there from here -and the staff doesn't really help .It seems that the staffers always leave out one crucial piece of information that just leads to more confusion. My room was a &quot;deluxe &quot; that supposedly had a king bed ,balcony and a hot tub.The king was more like a queen ,the balcony was a &quot;juliet&quot; -you could stand ,but no room for a chair,and the hot tub was simply a big tub w/ no jets.The room was clean,quiet, roomy,lots of towels ,and everything worked.The pool was nice ,but they blared music at top volume all the time.If you can work out a good -price deal at one of the nicer hotels on the strip ,than do so ,but if you can't ,the Imperial is a reasonably priced alternative."
78,376,"Oct 12 2009 	Good for the money	Outstanding Location - centrally located. If you're looking to do Vegas on the cheap, then this is a great spot. If you want the glitz and and outstanding service of some nicer hotels then don't come here. Great Value, the rooms are nothing special, the elevators aren't great, it's not very big, but the price is right. The rooms probably haven't updated in a long, long time. If room looks are important to you don't come here. We had a wall heater/AC. If you're just dropping off your bags and you're gone then why not."
79,376,Oct 11 2009 	Poor check-in service	The hotel was a decent price and a good location. But by making reservations you have to wait until after the official 4 PM check-in. People who didn't have reservations were able to check-in and get hotel keys right away. we had 4 rooms and only 1 available by 4 PM. Then one room wasn't even cleaned after we got the keys to check-in. Then we couldn't even get a discount. The noise was also annoying. And the pool closes way to early. We have stayed at the Circus Circus before and had better service and rooms. I would not stay at the Imperial Again.
80,376,"Oct 11 2009 	GOOD VALUE..... NO FRILLS	Stayed in room 1735...a mountain view between two wings of hotel. It is also near but not too near the slow lifts which many people complain about. Moved to this room after first being allocated a room almost overlooking Harrahs very loud outdoor music venue....no problem being moved.We have stayed at The Imperial several times over the last sixteen years and it hasn't changed that much, no better, no worse. It is a good value, ideally located hotel, in need of some updating but clean with comfortable beds in good sized rooms with a generous bathroom.The Emperors buffet we feel had deteriorated by last year but happy to say this year was much improved, though avoid sitting near the beverage station as it can get very noisy when servers are clearing the tables and stacking their carts, we had to move.The covenience store in the hotel is very expensive, much better to walk to Walgreens outside the Venetian and buy from there.I would have no hesitation to book The Imperial again next time I am in Las Vegas...."
81,376,Oct 11 2009 	Our stay at the Imperial Palace	We went to Vegas for our wedding. We stayed and got married at the Imperial Palace. For the most part our experience was a good one. The Wedding Chapel was great! Our room was clean. We ate at the breakfast buffet a couple of times which was good. We weren't impressed with the Pizza Palace. We had a good time walking through the Auto Show display.
82,376,Oct 10 2009 	love that i can find the elevator!	i like the intimacy of this hotel. it is easy to get to your room and back out onto the greatest part of the strip. great location. and we always seem to win at this little hotel. prefer it to larger and fancier places across the street.
83,376,"Oct 9 2009 	Love it	How can you go wrong? Center of the strip, $30 rooms, clean room and bath, clean hallways etc., good maid service, clean towels, large room with balcony, fun casino with $5 tables, entertainment day and night, dealer tainers, pool with barbecue and drinks. My 3rd time here, wont be my last. Their coupon book at check in is one of the best, coupons for all the harrah properties."
84,376,"Oct 9 2009 	Fun exciting time	Location is great for a fun, exciting time. Helpful staff and great time for us. Would go again."
85,376,"Oct 9 2009	Perfectly pleasant hotel and casino located in a great location	The Imperial Palace has not been able to keep up with the grand hotels on the strip in regards to opulance. However, we found the hotel to be very clean, the rooms spacious, and the staff extremely friendly and accomodating. In addition, the location is perfect, surrounded by the likes of the Mirage, Caesars, Bellagio, Bally's , Paris , and Planet Hollywood all within an easy walk. The price for the location was a deal."
86,376,"Oct 9 2009 	Great value in a great location	While the Imperial Palace is far from the fanciest hotel on the Strip, it cannot be beat for price or location. If all you need is a clean hotel room (How much time are you really spending in your room on a trip to Vegas anyway?), the Imperial Palace is a great option. It's located near the center of the Strip right across from Caesar's Palace. The Forum Shops are a five minute walk away. Also, the hotel has several restaurants, including a buffet and a 24 hour diner, as well as celebrity impersonator &quot;Dealer-tainers&quot; that make a walk through the casino enjoyable.I have stayed at the Imperial Palace twice now, and I would do so again. Between the location and the price, it makes for a great home base during a trip to Las Vegas."
87,376,Oct 9 2009	Worth the money	We stayed at Imperial Palace and got married in their chapel and we were pleased with everything. The rooms were clean and the hotel was centrally located.
88,376,"Oct 8 2009 	Great value 	When we went to check in, the room in the Capri building with a King bed that we had reserved was not available &amp; they told us that we would have a room with 2 double beds. I told them that it was our honeymoon &amp; that we had requested a king size bed. The gal immediately said oh, your honeymoon, well let me upgrade you. She asked if we minded being on the side above the outdoor club &amp; we didn't (cause we knew we'd be sleeping in the day if at all). For the money it was an awesome room. The only complaint is we could of had was the elevator. I was not working properly the entire 5 days we were there. Some days only one was in service.The pool staff was very friendly &amp; attentive &amp; even gave us a free shot because we were on our honeymoon!Overall if, you're on a budget &amp; want somewhere to lay your head down for a couple of hours this place was great! We would stay there again."
89,376,"Oct 8 2009 	Cheap 	We stayed at the Imperial Palace because it was, by far, the least expensive hotel on the strip that we could find. It was a relatively no frills hotel but it was right in the heart of all the action on the Vegas strip. The rooms were clean and nice, though a little on the plain side. In general the hotel is a bit outdated and the crowd is on the older side. We went to the buffet but were not at all impressed. However, the location just could not be beat. So while I wouldn't hang out there, or eat there, I would absolutely stay there again."
90,376,"Oct 8 2009 	Nice Inexpensive Place To Stay	This hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. It's older than most of the Strip hotels and lacks the glitz of most of the other hotels. However, the rooms are very inexpensive. I've stayed there a couple of times and the room was clean and reasonably comfortable. For the budget minded traveler this is definitely a great deal."
91,376,"Oct 8 2009 	Perfect location	The IP is located right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip....the location could not be better. The check in line was a bit long, but worth the wait for the price. The room was about average, nothing fancy and the room service was great! The pool area was nice and there was a waitress walking around taking drink orders. This was the perfect location for us to walk to the shows and other bars. Bill's Bar and Saloon is right down the road and has $.99 margaritas, $2 Coors light cans and $5 minimum black jack tables. We will definitely stay here again!"
92,376,"Oct 8 2009 	servicable	Well, Vegas wasn't quite for me, but it was an experience.The Imperial Palace itself certainly doesn't compare to places like MGM, Ceasars Palace, Bellagio etc..., that much is a given, but for a neat hotel, in an excellent location, you really can't go wrong. Plus the dealertainers are awesome!If I go back to Vegas, I probably won't go back to the Imperial Palace to stay again, I would probably go somewhere bigger, but it certainly was good enough for us.btw, Not quite sure why the pool closes @ 5, that annoyed us"
93,376,Oct 6 2009 	Everything was Great	Up graded to suite during checkin room was nice service was great the deals were friendly .The burger palace was reasonable but went up on price three dollars one morning so we went to harrahs breakfast buffet that was the best i have been to in a long time and the nice lady at cash register gave us a coupon for 5 dollars off for each that made it better.The I P buffet was not so good .Room was keep clean each day and personal were very nice. Not in the room that much anyways.Do go to Ellis Island for the steak breakfast and also supper but you have to ask for specials not on the menu steak supper $6.95 Steak Breakfast $4.95 its a hidden Gem
94,376,Oct 6 2009 	Great Location and Price	just got back from Vegas for my 61st birthday and stayed at the Imperial Palace. I read the reviews before I left and was a little worried. Well I must say that I would recommend this hotel to others and will stay here again. We stayed in a king deluxe room that over looked the strip. I was told at check-in that there might be noise because it overlooked the strip. The noise did not bother me at all. The room was nice and clean. A few things I missed were a microwave and in room coffee and refrigerator but for the most part the room was a great bargin for the two nights I was there. Remember folks you get what you pay for!!!!!!!!!
95,376,"Oct 4 2009 	Not bad not great	If you want somewhere in the middle of the strip for a reasonable price, this is probably the place. It's not fancy, far from it actually. The people at the front desk were very kind and helpful. The room was dated, and not the cleanest. The water backed up in the tub when I took a shower. It took about 20 minutes for it to drain. I was in Vegas for a wedding, it was a really quick trip, over and back in less tan 24 hours. So this hotel served it's purpose. I was only in the room a total of 4 hours. If I were going to stay longer, this isn't the hotel I would probably choose."
96,376,"Oct 3 2009 	It seemed like a good idea at the time!	I was travelling alone to a wedding in Las Vegas, decided on the Imperial Palace as it was central and reasonably priced, but thankfully didn't book a really really cheap room in the annex! On arrival, after a 22 hour journey and expecting a haven I encountered bedlam. The noise at reception is unbelievable - slot machines and drunks competing as to who can be loudest. After being herded 'a la Disney' I had to communicate in sign language with a bored receptionist, was sent to the wrong lift and had to return to the ground floor,still with bags as no porters were in evidence and start again. The room was clean (ish) but dingy although it did have everything I needed. If you like being a patient sardine this is the hotel for you, the lifts are slow, small and infrequent. If I had not been so worn out I would have looked elsewhere. The wifi is expensive and unreliable, room service slow and not cheap, the shops are tatty and not cheap and Bettys Diner i.e the place where you will eventually be able to buy a sad overpriced sandwich is erm, interesting. If you want a bed to crash out on, fine. If you want peace and to feel vaguely safe, avoid. It was still worth it though to be at my nieces wedding at the Bellagio! Now, there is a hotel and a half......... I described the hotel in an e mail tomy husband as 'chav central attends a trailer trash convention'. Nuff said."
97,376,"Oct 3 2009	customer service is supreme at the IP	Our group of 22 stayed at the Imperial Palace from 9-26-09 thru 9-29-09. We had no trouble with check-in, the elevator's, or cleanliness of the room's. Everyone was sofriendly and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay a pleasure. Will return for another stay in the spring."
98,376,Oct 1 2009 	No Better Deal In Vegas!!!!	We were pretty skeptical from some of the reviews so we were hesitant to stay at the IP. But from the moment we arrived to check-out we were nothing but impressed. For the money you won't find a nicer place with outstanding service. We were catered to and treated like the entire time. You can find nicer hotels on the strip but you will pay much more. But you will never be treated better than by the staff at the Imperial Palace....give them a shot.... you will be pleasantly surprised
99,376,"Oct 1 2009 	Average and Tough to Contrast	The most important thing you need to keep in mind: there's a reason the Imperial Palace is usually the best/most affordable deal in Las Vegas. It's one of the older hotels on the strip and not really all that old when you think about it, it's just that hotels on the strip have an average lifespan of between 10 and 20 years.First of all, no one goes to Las Vegas to spend a significant amount of time in their room unless they're passed out or drunk. If you are you're going for the wrong reasons. Is it nice to have a luxurious hotel room waiting for you to get out of the scorching hot desert atmosphere? Of course, but all you really need is a reliable base of opperations and you're set. The Imperial is perfect for this. Now its pointless to compare the Imperial to all the glamorous hotels surrounding it. It's obviously not going to stack up, but you get what you pay for. In this case its a sensible room with reliable air conditioning and the perfect location - dead center of the strip. The lobby is dingy, the decor out-dated and the rooms are par at best but enjoy it! That is unless you feel like paying double the price for a room you'll hardly spend any time in."
100,376,"Oct 1 2009 	Great Stay!	Like most reviews I have read about the Imperial Palace, I do agree that some updating is needed...carpet in particular. Our room was quite nice overlooking the pool. The carpet was a bit stained, but overall, the room was neat and clean and we found everything in working order. The hotel staff was very accommodating and room service, which we had twice, was very prompt and the food was quite good. We ate at several of the restaurants in the hotel and all were equally as good. We had also read about problems with the elevators, but we found no problem with them at all. The location, to say the least, is fabulous! I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and have always had a positive experience. This time was no exception. A great value...great service...great location...we couldn't have asked for more."
101,376,"Oct 1 2009 	The most average hotel on the strip	I would describe the IP as the most average of hotels - its not the Bellagio and at the other extreme its not Circus Circus.Room had dated decor but the linen/towels were changed regularly, the carper wasn't always vacuumed when the room was cleaned. The hotel corridors were very noisy at night, but then again this is Vegas and people come and go 24/7.The casino offered lower $ minimum stakes than some casinos, the restaurants were pretty average. Nothing bad to say about it, likewise nothing that good either except its very central.$20 dollar trick didn't work."
102,376,"Sep 29 2009 	Excellent value for money couldn't ask for a better location on the strip	This was the first time my partner and I had been to the Imperial Palace. My sister recommended it to me. I was warned not to expect anything like the Paris, where we had stayed on our previous trip. For the money we paid, I wasn't expecting it to be quite so good. Ok so the rooms need some TLC, and the first room we were given was unmade and full of dirty dishes. But after going back to reception they gave us a different room and were very apologetic. Lets be honest, when your in Vegas all you want is a comfy bed to sleep after a long day gambling and shopping. This was definately what we got. The staff at the Imperial were brilliant. The look a like stars that deal the card games were very entertaining. The atmosphere and buzz around the casino was amazing. We did try the Emperor's Buffett, which I wouldn't recommend but the burger place was good. There are so many different places to eat in Vegas, to suit every budget you just have to shop around and try it. We enjoyed our stay so much that my partner and his friends are going back in March 2010 for a 50th birthday celebration."
103,376,"Sep 23 2009 	Ok for the Strip!	My stay at the Imperial Palace was from 9/11/09 to 9/13/09. I was in town for a Travel Trade Convention. I wanted to check out this hotel since the rates were excellent for being right on the Strip but the reviews were 'so-so'. It's certainly not 5-Star but it was clean &amp; served it's purpose. I was a little disappointed since I knew this was part of the Harrah's properties now. However; with this addition, the Harrah's now has an Hotel for every 'walk of life'! The cafe' served great breakfast. I also picked this Hotel since it was part of the Monorail system &amp; needed to get to the Convention Center daily. I didn't want to be stuck at the hotel right next to the Convention (although Hilton Las Vegas is perfect!) but it gave me a chance to be close to the strip. I also stayed at the Bally's (another Harrah's property); check out my review &amp; photos also."
104,376,"Sep 22 2009 	Im a fan of Imperial Palace	Considering the location and price of Imperial Palace, Im not bothered with the mould in the bathroom or the stains on the floor, the staff were friendly and helped us out on finding cheap attractions in and around las vegas. Shot Imperial Palace!"
105,376,"Sep 21 2009 	Great Stay	I read all the reviews of this hotel and was a little worried. Starting with check in. We arrived about 6:30 pm and there was a long line at chedk in. But I am a frequent player at Harrahs so I went to the Platnum/Diamomd line and ther was no one in line so our check in was quick. We got to our rooms and they were very clean and had everyting we needed. Yes they are in need of some TLC but they were still very nice. We went next door to Harrahs to catch the shuttle to the Rio and quess what, no one in line to check in there, so I guess price does matter since rooms at Harrahs are at least twice as much per night as the IP. We stayed for three nights and had no problem with maid service at all. Now the elevators. Yes sometimes you had to wait a few minutes, but it is a very large hotel and had a lot of guests. They have several banksof elevators, so you just find the ones closest to your room and use those. The ice machine closest to our room was out of order, but the one further down the hall worked just fine.We did not eat at his hotel because having been to Veagas many times before I had already made plans to take our Grandson to other places that we enjoy. (The purpose of this trip was our Grandson's 21st birthday)Our stay at the IP was very good. We used valet parking and it was prompt and courteous. It is mid strip and you can walk to everything. If you want a good room on the strip the IP is the place to stay."
106,376,"Sep 21 2009 	Worst experience in my many stays in Las Vegas	We have stayed in at least Ten (10) Casinos in Las Vegas, at least twice at the Imperial Palace since 1993, and this was our worst experience. Made complimentary room reservations months in advance requesting two Queen size beds. At check in I again requested Queen size beds. Was informed at check in of a $10 processing fee on the FREE rooms. Assigned a room and found two double beds in room. Complained by phone, and was told Queen beds would be an additional $20 per night. Went down and complained in person about no notification in advance of any additional charges or room bed size costs, &amp; after desk clerk talked to a supervisor was give a room with queen beds at no additional charge for this visit. My wife and daughter were trapped in an elevator because the doors would not open. Other elevators broke down at least twice during our three day stay, and the elevators were very slow. On every trip in the elevators the conversations included comments about the elevators, and at least three (3) times I heard persons say that they would never stay at the Imperial Palace again, and my wife said she did not ever want to stay there again either. We have stayed at other Harrahs Casinos, &amp; other hotels on the strip &amp; Fremont st. &amp; were always informed in advance of any additional charges for requested services or items. And we have never had to pay a Processing Fee for Complimentary rooms or an additional charge for queen beds. My brother checked in at the Imperial Palace the same day I did for his Complimentary room &amp; was not charged a processing fee."
107,376,"Sep 19 2009 	First room the put me in	When we arrived they put me in room #147 which was a 2 elevator trim- 1 up and then a long walk to 1 down. The room was old, musty and overlooking a fire escap. I went back to the desk and told them I wanted to change, but was told that that was all they had in a non smoking room. Since it was 9 PM, I had no choice. I was told to come back between 2 and 6 pm the next day and see what was available. I went back to the desk early the next morning and when I asked the lady about a change, as I would not be there between 2 and 6 pm that day, she asked me wha floor I wanted and gave me a choice of rooms to move to as she had them ready at this time. They put me in a very comfortable room, clean and near the elevator. Assuming this, I am sure that there were rooms the night before!! I would recomend that if the put you in a room in the 100 numbers and if they will not move you speak to the manager, as the originaly room and location should not be acceptws."
108,376,"Sep 19 2009 	would book this hotel again	just returned today on arrival we were told that our room was a bit out of the way as we had to get 2 elevators but to come back the next afternoon to get a better room which we did although there was nothing wrong with the 1st room.it was on the13th floor overlooking the strip it was a bit noisy but this didnt bother us as we spend little time in our room the room spacious enough ,the bathroom was a bit small but clean no complaints.The dealertainers were good would have like a comfy chair in 1 of the bars to listen to them. my only complaint would be the buffet only used it once service was poor food average have been to better buffets would visit this hotel again perfectly situated in the strip"
109,376,"Sep 18 2009 	Just unlucky	We were told that Deluxe rooms have a better view and recently renovated compared to the standard rooms, so we went ahead and booked it. However was given one which was not renovated and no views and it was dark. We asked to see another deluxe and room and found that it was much bigger than our room. The stadard room was no different to our room apart from the beds headboard (different shape). Maybe because we booked on a cheap deal. The room had a funny smell and looking at it, it has not been occupied for a long time as we could see the dust off from the information booklet. If you're going to book this place, make sure you request for rooms on a higher floor as they look bigger and cleaner with lots of light. Reception staff were not knowledgable when asked for simple tourist information, not the best customer service. They muddled up our room arrangements. It took my friend forever to try and arrange a shuttle to the airport, she was passed around like a ball from one person to another. We were not keen on the restaurants so didnt' try it. Overall, the location was good for the price. All depends on what you're after. I certainly would spend a bit more on a better hotel even though it's only a bed for the night. But it pays to sleep in a comfy room."
110,376,"Sep 18 2009 	Good deal - if you're on the move	Location was great, right in the middle of the strip. I was in for my brother's wedding which was across the street at Caesar's. The room wasn't the best but didn't spend too much time there and didn't spend too much money on the room. There are little decks in the rooms lookings out to the pool which was nice. The pool was ok but you start losing the sun around 5. People were friendly."
111,376,"Sep 17 2009 	Vegas on the cheap	I was prepared for the worst when I booked the rooms for my latest Vegas trip at the Imperial. The Imperial didn't disappoint. Let's just say that if you are looking for a really cheap place to stay and don't mind grime, rust, stink and a bad view - the Imperial is for you. You can tell that they haven't done much with this place in the last few decades. The lobby is decent but decency ends there. The rooms were cramped, dank and really showed their age. I would place the Imperial a few pegs down from a Motel 6. All that being said, I would still recommend this hotel. It's a great option if you want to go to Vegas, be located in a great spot and save some money on lodging for the tables and booze. There is a decent dance club between the hotel entrance and street that is small but fun. Overall a good place to stay on the cheap."
112,376,"Sep 16 2009 	this was my first time at the imperial palace and i loved it.	try to visit all the free activities they have to offer, they will fill your day up completely."
113,376,"Sep 15 2009 	Quit yer gripin'!	You get what you pay for; always have always will. IP was a great location and nothing close to the bad reviews seen here. It is what it is; a convenient location and what I liken to mildly lower grade LaQuinta. The elevators were no problem. And we were told it was one of their busiest days. It took a grand total of 10 minutes to check in. Since they were completely booked, we received breakfast for free. Our room was nice except we were directly over the bar. It was loud, but not that loud. We had played so much during the day that we fell right asleep and never noticed the crappy DJ. The rooms were adequate, clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Pillows were the only draw back. I called for extras and 4 hours later called again. We had not received enough for each bed. They immediately brought 6 pillows and 4 bath towels and apologized profusely. Hey, good enough for me.If you want a little more &quot;swank&quot; to your hotel, spend the extra $40 a night and go to Monte Carlo. It's nicer, the rooms are bigger, but it's still the same room ran by the same group of people and that includes Bellagio and MGM.One thing to the IP General Manager...your Entertainment Dealers look nothing like who their impersonating and putting them on a stage in the middle of the poker room with a sound track to lip synch is old and tired. There was one girl who was supposed to be Celine Dion, but she was black and had short hair. Really, spend the extra $3 per hour and get better side show folks.One caveat...the luau dinner. It was WONDERFUL. We had the best time and met the dancers after the show. Talked with the girls in the ladies' room and they were so sweet. The food was adequate, but the crab legs, mussels, and crawfish were abundant. The Mai Tai's were cute and sweet. The creme' brulee' sucked, but it came in a cupcake wrapper so what should I have expected? The show was fun, though.Stay here if you're ok with middle class travel. If you like higher middle class; don't. I've stayed at many places and this is second time at IP. I'll stay again. ***They didn't have a spa opening, so they sent us to Harrah's for the same price. Harrah's spa is MUCH nicer."
114,376,"Sep 13 2009 	Perfect Location!	Imperial Palace may not be the fanciest of hotels on the Las Vegas strip, but it scores top marks for value! We stayed here for 5 nights, in a room located on the 15th floor. Yes, it's very basic, but what do you expect for 24 a night?! We were very pleased with the standard of our room - clean, spacious and comfortable. The TV and ironing facilities were a bonus too! The hotel itself had little to complain about. The pool area was clean and there were plenty of sun loungers and towels available for the guests. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The lifts were a pain (they take forever - take the stairs if you're only a few floors up!!), but Im sure many of the big hotels have this problem! Other than that, I really can't think of anything bad to say about it! I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value for money! Its the perfect place for budget travelers, or for those who just want to save their money to spend on the good things in Vegas, like cocktails and fancy meals!"
115,376,"Sep 13 2009 	Great spot cannot beat the location	We just got back yesterday. We stayed in deluxe room #1286. The balcony was facing the strip, with the rockhouse below it was very loud, this I knew, and requested. It's open till 3am, great for loud and wild travelers. Don't bother bringing any Bon Jovi, they played it 3 or 4 times a day. &quot;So funny&quot;. Great view could not ask for better, especially for only $35 a night. It is old but, holding up well. We stayed tues-fri check in was fast. The room was a little used, I heard from other travelers to bring clorox wipes, that did the trick. IP does get busy during the weekends, so naturally the elevators were slower. The longiest we waited was 10 min. There is 2 sets of elevators, just ask the staff aroud they tell you. We used valet the whole time, real easy just give them a buck each time, it's worth not having to walk, considering your walking everywhere else. Hope this review helps. I took a chance and i'm so glad I did. I was worried about the reviews. I had booked our trip 9 months ago, and was reading the reviews for 9 months. Recommend to all! Go Steelers!"
116,376,"Sep 13 2009 	Best decision of my entire vacation	We are Aussies and it was our first time in Vegas. Stayed for 5 days on the &quot;All in&quot; package. This meant that in addition to our room, we had unlimited drinks at the casino/pool bars and unlimited visits to the buffet and Tea Room cafe. This turned out to be the best decision on the entire trip, as we saved so much on food and drinks. Was about US$150 per night (total for 2 people) .Here's a few quick opinions:Location: Fantastic. Enough said.Room: We had a &quot;Deluxe Luv Tub Room&quot; which was huge and always well cleaned. Old yes, but more than adequate considering how much time you actually spent in it. Ice machine worked fine the entire time.Elevators: Seems to be a common grudge on here. Personally, we never had to wait more than 2 minutes for an elevator in the lobby, going UP. To be fair, we always took the stairs DOWN from our room, so we only had to wait on our room floor once when we checked out with our luggage (only 2 mins).Buffet: Forget it. Worst part of the hotel by far. Very Glad not to be paying $14 each time we went. Avoid if possible.Food (Tea House): We only went to the &quot;Tea House Cafe&quot; for our meals (at least once a day) and food was standard American fare, generous portions and prepared quickly. Can't complain. Can't comment on value because it was incuded in our package deal.Staff: All satff we dealt with were courteous and attentive.Casino: Old, and a bit stale-smelling. But if you don't like it, just go somewhere else! It's Vegas DUH! Dealertainers are great fun and a must see if you are visiting.Pool: Fine. Good Bar service and not over crowded, even on the days when it was 108 degrees.Again, to be fair, we did stay mid week (Sun-Fri) so we weren't there on the weekend.Imperial Palace is what it is. Would I stay there again? No worries."
117,376,"Sep 12 2009 	Probably the cheapest on the strip but i'd still go elsewhere	First off, the rooms were fine. Pretty standard, but it was clean and nice enough. When we checked in, we were told they didn't have a double bed room for us, so we stayed in a king size for one day. The view was great, and one night sharing a bed with a friend wasn't a big deal. We then moved to a lower floor, where the rooms faced the &quot;ugly&quot; side. If i had thought of it, i would have asked about keeping the good view, and a smoking room. Anyway, it took me a few days to figure out the layout of the hotel. Depending on your room number, if you get on the wrong elevator you'll be walking for a long time. Certain elevators only go to rooms and others only go to the salon and stuff. The restaurants are beside the front desk, up an escalator. The wait times for the elevator are crazy long. I've read alot of reviews about staying in the tower as opposed to the older rooms, and that's absolutely true. They are new and much nicer. The pool was nothing special, i would have liked it to have been more. I did like how the hotel was in the middle of the strip however.Onto the salon. I would recomend you not wasting your time or money with this place. I called to make an appointment a few weeks before my stay, and was told i could have a triple barrel curling iron style. When i got to the appointment however, i was told that they do not have the iron for that and &quot;we're the only two here, so no one would have told you that&quot; I don't think calling your customer a liar is a good way to start off. But since i already booked the appointment, i would have had to pay even if i cancelled. It was also quite expensive. She didn't wash my hair, and it was 55 dollars to dry style it. Needless to say, the style didn't stay and i could have done a much better job by myself. Walking through the other hotels, i saw their casinos seemed more spacious, and most seemed more updated. I didn't think the breakfast place was very good, as all they had were basics. The flamingo just down the street had many more options, or there's a denny's and mcdonalds also down the road. The whole trip was very cheap, and for the money it was a good deal. Next time i go, i will be staying elsewhere, just because it seems for a little more money i get alot more bang. Some things i noticed about vegas itself were the deuce. It was 15 bucks for a 3 days pass, and i found it to be very worthwhile. This bus will take you up and down the strip, freemont street and to this wicked outlet mall with a transfer. You get on the 108 after to go to the mall. I would definitely reccomend the outlet mall, i found some really awesome deals. Freemont street is the best place for souvenirs. They have shot glasses, ashtrays, cups, pretty much anything you want for a dollar. There are people on the street that sell club passes, and they usually want a 20 dollar tip. I didn't end up using mine, but i found a great place i loved with no cover. They are part of harrah's, when you walk down a windy road with little kiosks and it's a circle bar. They do need your passport if your not from the states though. I got a showtime shuttle pass from the airport, although i found this specific company to be sub par. I would wait until i got off the plane and buy a ticket from one of the other companies. Overall, i had a fabulous time in vegas. You really can't go wrong with drinking, shopping and seeing the sights."
118,376,"Sep 12 2009 	Brilliant location!	We stayed at the Imperial Palace for a week and although we were a little disappointed when we arrived (after looking up all the big hotels before we went), for the price we paid it was well worth it! The hotel is in need of a refit but its clean and tidy and the staff were very good. The room was large and of course it had air con! It could have done with a fridge to keep our bottled water chilled but we managed OK with the ice bucket provided. The bathroom was small and you had to shut the door and stride over the toilet to get into the shower but once in the shower was hot and very powerful. They also provided shampoo, conditioner and soap. The pool was nice, a real sun trap in the morning and early afternoon but as the sun moved around it did end up in the shade. The casino was always packed and full of the usual games you would expect.The location was perfect, right across the road from Caesars Palace &amp; Bellagio and about a 5 min walk from Venetian so we didn't actually spend much time at the hotel.We tried the Burger Palace one afternoon and it was OK. We also tried to get a Pizza (Pizza Palace?) but it was closed. The Chinese/Korean/Japanese place was open 24 hours but we didn't try it. The monorail was right outside too, so we used that to get to the Stratosphere at the other end of the strip.There was also a car museum but we didn't get a chance to visit it.All in all, the hotel interior could be better but its so cheap and if you using it like we did, simply for a bed for the night then its great value."
119,376,"Sep 10 2009 	Imperial Palace is always my choice	I stayed at Imperial Palace for 4 nights in March and 4 nights again in September. The location is the greatest, my room was extremely clean, I was treated great by the staff and I will stay here again on my next trip which will be soon.OK so the sink and shower drained slowly, I can live with that. The water didn't stand after you turned it off, it simply drained slowly. The commode flushed normally. I don't like the buffet there and think it is overpriced even with the $5 off coupon, but most all Vegas buffets are pretty terrible.I got an unbelievable deal there by using my Harrah's Total Reward card number and booking it at the Harrah's web site.I can't get over the negative things that are said about Imperial Palace in the reviews. I think that a lot of people just look for the smallest thing to complain about and others are pure and simple snobs. It doesn't really matter. I can truthfully say that after several stays there I don't have any complaints, maybe because I didn't go to Vegas to stay in a hotel room.Another thing I enjoy is that right next door at Oshea's there's a Burger King (which is great for breakfast and very good cheap coffee) and a Subway.I give Imperial Palace two thumbs up."
120,376,Sep 10 2009 	VALUE AND LOCATION ARE GREAT	this spot has the best location right in the middle of the strip. room was clean and good size and casino was pumping all week! sure its not the bellagio but for what i paid i would stay there anytime! staff were helpful and friendly. definately a good spot for any1 seeking the heart of the action.
121,376,Sep 10 2009 	The Imperial Whatever	I stayed at the imperial Palace for business and the hotel was more like a motel. It was Imperial alright but NO palace. The rooms were bare and dirty. The carpets were stained. Paints peeling and stinky rooms. The hotel is like a maze and it took forever to get to places. I ate at the Ginseng restaurant at the food was horrible! My room was pre-paid for 2 nights -- I stayed the night my flight came in and transferred to another hotel. I don't mind loosing the 65.00 dollars -- it was worth every penny checking out of the hotel!
122,376,"Sep 8 2009 	Great Location but DISGUSTING rooms..price can be good at the right time of year.	This was our third trip to Vegas, second time staying at the IP. Our first trip was great, just my husband and I. The room was fine and had no HUGE complaints; so when we decided to go again with more people, we chose the IP because we had no HUGE problems previously, and for the value and location, you can't complain! Right!?!? WRONG!!! We went with five people and shared a room and had two queens and brought an air mattress...SSSHHH Don't tell!!! Anyhow...we arrived around midnight and waited in a line so incredibly long...it took an hour and a half to check in. Throughout the E NTIRE process, the lady kept saying, if you don't like you room, just let us know. Whey would you say that over and over and over?? We soon found out. Even with the EXTENSIVE map she gave us to find our room, and about four elevator rides later, and only getting lost twice, we FINALLY found our room. WHAT A DUMP!! It smelled musty, but we were looking forward to finally gambling. As I changed into some cuter clothes, I thought the floor was kinda damp, but paid it no heed...We just wanted to go play!! Well, around 4:30 we were ready for bed. The room was still smelling musty, so we went to open a window...NO WAY TO DO IT!! It was a completely sealed room, no ventilation whatsoever!! OK, And it was a smoking room?? How does a person smoke with no ventilation?? Anyway, we all changed into our PJ's, and I laid down in bed. THERE WAS A HUGE WET SPOT ON MY BED!!!!!!!!!!! By this time it was 5 in the morning and my husband wanted to go to sleep so he put a thick layer of towels down and switched sides with me. When we got up around 10, we went downstairs to somplain and switch rooms, and the &quot;manager&quot;, in a VERY snotty tone, told us we should have complained earlier. And after MUCH complaining they finally switched the rooms for us. No sorry, no comps, nothing. We had to complain and complain and complain to finally get a new room. What kind of customer service is that??? In the end we still had a decent time, but the whole trip I couldn't get laying down in a wet bed out of my mind....it STILL gives me the eebie-jeebies. UGH!!! We will be returning in November, but no way in HELL are we ever staying at the IP again!!!! P.S. The tea room (I think it was) is INCREDIBLY over-priced....$10 for a BLT..are you kidding me?? And the pool is TINY!!!"
123,376,"Sep 7 2009 	Nice clean room	Stayed at the IP for 4 nights with 2 friends. We were on the 15th floor. Check in was fast, clerk very friendly. Everyone we encountered was friendly. Our room was clean. We tipped the maid every day. I left her one note asking for extra shampoo. Every day after that we had extra toiletries. Room was cleaned late in the afternoon every day but we were usually out at that time. We were in our room one day and just asked her to wait a minute and left so she could clean. My room was comped so we had a nice free stay but would have been worth it to pay. No, this is not a 4 star hotel but everyone should realize that. It was clean and quiet which is what we wanted. We had breakfastone morning at the Teahouse and the food was very good as was the service."
124,376,Sep 7 2009 	Very dissapointed.... will never return	I read the reviews on here and was a little concerned but it appered that the good reviews outweighed the bad so I gave it a chance. We were dissapointed from the second we pulled into the parking garage. We have traveled to Vegas many times and usually stay at the Monte Carlo. Because of the holiday weekend we deicded to try the Imperial Palace since it was cheaper and we were trying to travel on a budget. There was free parking which was good but the parking gararge was hard to navigate. The walk to the building to check in was confusing and long. You have to walk through the entire casino full of people to get to the front desk. The newer hotels have the front desk and guest elevators in a more private location so you aren't navigating a crowded casino floor with your luggage. Check in was ok and we went up to the room. The hallway smelled like urine and the room is old and dingy. There were hairs in the bathtub and the room needs to be updated. The TV didn't work well and the air conditioner didn't turn off so we froze all night. The bed was stiff as a board and we got a terrible night sleep. The walls weren't as thin as I would have expected and it was quiet which was the only plus I can think of. The elevators were slow and always full. We had to wait for close to 20 minutes to get down with our luggage when we were ready to check out. The bathtub did not drain when you took a shower so you were standing in water the entire time which was gross since I knew the tub wasn't clean. Wallpaper was peeling and the rooms need a serious update. I will not stay here again nor will I reccomend to friends. We were traveling with another couple and they have taken away my hotel selection privlages as a result of this trip as they were also unimpressed./
125,376,"Sep 6 2009 	Location Location Location	The Imperial Palace may be one of the more run down hotels on the Strip but its prices do reflex this and it absolutely cannot be beaten on location. The rooms were fine for what we needed (a place to sleep and to get changed etc.) and were clean. I was really surprised at the shower pressure, it was amazing for being in a big hotel in the middle of the desert. The staff were great and helped quickly and efficiently with any queries we had. Never had to wait long for the elevators, the casino and pool were both fine but with the rest of the strip being so accessible I would recommend this for people using their hotel simply as somewhere to sleep."
126,376,"Sep 6 2009 	Worst hotel of the holiday	- Bathroom dirty with leaking taps- Room substandard with dirty wallpaper hanging off- Elevators didn't work (one working elevator for 2,600 rooms); took 30 minutes to get from floor 10 to ground in the morning. No option to use the stairs if coming up- Pool closed on sunny day because of non-existent threat of rain- $10 charge for internetMaybe worth $20 / night tops but not $90 + they charge on a weekend!"
127,376,Sep 3 2009 	Nice hotel for a great price	When i started reading reviews on this hotel it had me a little worried that it wouldnt be nice. I stayed there for 6 nights and loved the hotel. We had a pretty fast checkin and the lady gave us directions to the room. When we checked out the room we were throughly impressed it was a pretty nice room especially for the price it was a deluxe room on the 9th floor. We had no problems at all the room was clean the shower drained fast the maid always did a nice job. The elevators were pretty slow on the weekend but the rest of the time wasnt too bad. We were on a non smoking floor and it didnt smell at all of smoke and it was quiet too. I also love the location of the hotel too right in the middle of everything. We also ate at the burger bar restraunt that the hotel has it has nice food and great pizza ate there a few times because of the convenience and good food. I would love to stay here again if i ever came back.
128,376,"Sep 3 2009 	You get what you pay for	great location, but as most people should understand, you get what you pay for. I stayed here during my second visit to Vegas (the first time was with a friend living here). The rooms are decent, but being an older hotel, you can still smell the smoke that has saturated most of the room.C'mon, you're in Vegas... you shouldn't be spending time in your room anyways!I probably wouldn't stay here again, but I would recommend it to people who are very cost conscious and still want to be where the action is (it is smack dab in the middle of the strip)."
129,376,"Sep 2 2009 	I would stay again but would try other Harrah's properties first	I was able to get this room complimentary as I am a Total Rewards member. I was leery at first as I read many of the comments here, but I decided to take a chance.The Imperial Palace is good for someone who is on a budget or is looking for no frills. The hotel is older and you can tell no improvements have been made recently.I arrived at the hotel around 11 am. The check in process was a little time consuming, as the line was long and there were only four Guest Services Representatives. When I had the opportunity to check in, the representative confirmed my complimentary room as well as gave me discounts for sister properties (Harrah's, Bally's, Cesaers Palace, Flamingo, Rio Suites, and Paris).As everyone else has mentioned, elevators are SLOW! After a day, I became accustomed to calling my direction at both sets of elevators and then going with the one that came first.The Deluxe Room was big, but could have used more furniture (maybe a sofa bed instead of table and chairs). My room had an indirect view of Cesaers Palace, but a direct view of the parking lot. If possible, ask for a room with a poool view (good for people watching).The bathroom was clean, although the drain did not flow as fast as I would. In addition, the shower would start even before you pulled the gauge to start it.Housekeeping left enough towels not to have to replenish as it was just me. I do have one complaint. I came back to my room one day to see my bed unmade. The first time was okay because I had left my laptop on the bed. Housekeeping cannot touch your personal property, therefore the bed was unmade. I removed my laptop, called Housekeeping, and informed the telephone representative that I would like to have my bed made. They never came that night.While at the hotel, I ate at Burger Palace, Ginseng 3, and the Emperor's Buffet. Burger Palace offers a 1/2 pound cheeseburger combo (burger, fries, and drink) for $9.XX. While I know I should have not eaten eight ounces of beef, it did fill me up, especially since I had not eaten since 6 am EST. Ginseng 3 is the 24 hours restaurant serving Chinese, Japanese. and Korean food. The sushi was AMAZING (Spicy Tuna rolls), and I asked for a second order. I ate at the Emperor's Buffet for breakfast the day of my departure. The cost was about $14 and you can tell that the buffet catered to the late night partiers and the early risers. Some of the selections included eggs, pancakes, fried chicken, rice, and cake.The casino is small in my opinion, although the hotel has dealers who are impersonators. Sometimes these impersonators would perform on a mini stage. I went during Michael Jackson's birthday, so there was an impersonator for him, as well as a J. Lo (Jennifer Lopez) impersonator.Pool area is SMALL! The last time I came to Las Vegas I stayed at the Riviers Hotel and their pool is twice as big (to give some perspective). Get there early if you plan to go. It was nice to sit out there and get some sun.I did like the fact that the Monorail that runs from the Sahara to the MGM Grand had a stop near Imperial Palace. The Monorail run 19 hours a day.Location of Imperial Palace cannot be beat! It is across the street from Cesaers, so you are in the middle of the strip. I did express checkout since I did not have any charges to the room, so that was easy.Overall, an okay stay. if I come back to Las Vegas, I will check other Harra's properties, but I will not turn my nose at the Imperial Palace."
130,376,"Sep 2 2009 	Great Value!	Every complaint I read before this trip complained about elevators being slow. We didn't experiece this problem at all. If you take the first set of elevators closest to the strip you will be fine. We never had to wait. Other people that took the set of elevators closest to parking had problems where they would wait and turn away 4-5 elevators because they were full. The casino was friendly with its payouts. The dealertainers...some were spot on and others....missed it completely!!! We didn't eat there, but we used the coupons our room came with to eat at Paris and Bally, both good buffets. Didn't go to the pool, but did check out the car collection."
131,376,"Sep 2 2009 	Disappointed	Great location, smack in the center of the strip, but let down by tired rooms and poor facilities. Tried the 24hr Burger Bar (at 8pm) which was dirty and unkempt. The food was poor and the coffee must have come from the sink!We tried the Dinner Buffet once. That was enough.Although the rooms were clean and tidy with maid service daily, the fixtures were showing signs of age. A lot of the silvering on the Bathroom mirror was missing, the balcony door refused to shut and the &quot;Air Con&quot; was the noisiest in LV.They have a gimmick whereby certain dealers in the Casino are look-alikes and will at random jump up onto a small podium and sing. Without doubt &quot;Billy Idol&quot; got the place rocking, but several of the others should stick to dealing.Stayed at Circus Circus 2 years ago, and if we went again we'd be happy to go back there (we holiday on a tight budget!)At the end of the day, we only used the Hotel for somewhere to sleep, we ate, gambled and partied elsewhere in LV and had a great time."
132,376,"Sep 1 2009 	Can't Beat the Location or the Service	The hotel is an older one that could certainly use renovating but if you were like us, the room is basically a place to lay your head for a few hours, shower and get up and go all over again. We knew what to expect from recommendations from friends but were at first somewhat taken aback. Upon arrival, the room looked clean and sufficient to meet our needs. We did have a problem the first night with a backed up shower and slow flushing toilet. Front desk immediately sent someone over to take care of the problem and we were then good to go. As I am not a fan of air conditioning, we decided to open the balcony door but later learned that water bugs love humidity and found one in our room. Another call to the front desk and we were immediately moved. They were fantastic in their customer service and left us quite happy.The location alone is by far the best along the strip. Convenient to everything without having to cross bridges or large intersections. Well worth the value and an enjoyable stay was had."
133,376,"Sep 1 2009 	Great location great service great time!	The location of this hotel is spot on. It's right in the middle of the strip, next to the flamingo, mirage and several other big casinos. The hotel and casino are fairly cheep and cheerful but that was fine with us. We found the staff very friendly, especially those at the bar. The 'lookalike' dealers in the casino were hilarious and kept us entertained. The food at the hotel isn't great but with so many places to eat nearby, you don't need to stay there anyway. I would definitely recommend this place. We had a fantastic time (especially at the bar!) and would certainly stay there again."
134,376,"Sep 1 2009 	Good hotel great location	My friend and I stayed at Imperial Palace August 16-19. We had stayed there previously so we knew what to expect. Our check in process was no problem and Ben, at check in, was friendly and very accommodating. We asked for adjoining rooms and there was no problem. Our rooms were clean and our floor was quiet. We ate breakfast at the Emperor's Buffet 2 times with no complaints and the Tea Palace for one breakfast and everything was good. The &quot;dealertainers&quot; in the casino were fun and put on good shows. Our only &quot;complaint&quot; would be that the elevators were a little slow and one was not working our entire stay. If you're looking for a clean hotel with a fun casino and great location to other places, stay at the Imperial Palace. We would definitely stay there again!"
135,376,Aug 31 2009 	This will do if you are on a Budget	This is a vast hotel on the strip so cant be beaten for location. The rooms are large and clean but not fancy. We didn't gamble (teenagers) but everyone seemed happy enough on the floors! The pool is large but packed so avoid at all costs. The Emperors Buffet is simple and filling. Valet parking is cheap and efficient. A decent place at a reasonable rate.
136,376,"Aug 31 2009 	PLACE IS A DUMP	Service was good when i first got there..room wasnt very clean, especialy the bathroom yuck they seriously need to do a better job cleaning the bathrooms and the tub didnt even drain it just filled up they need some plumbing done..beds arent very comfortable its like sleeping on springs..the pool was kinda gross as well, towels had stains, pool smelt strong of chlorine and had hairs and random stuff floating in it, the pool chairs did not smell pleasant at all..the elevators took foreverrrr it got really irritating..cheap rooms but not worth it, better off spending the extra money for a nicer hotel..i would not stay here again this hotel needs to be rennovated or just completely demolished, i would be embaressed if i owned this hotel"
137,376,"Aug 31 2009 	Clean Comfortable stay	My husband and I were looking for a cheap, but clean and comfy stay on the strip. After looking through many options, I found The Imperial Palace. I am always one to look at reviews and do my research before I book anything. I read some good reviews on this place, and read even more horrible ones. I saw great pictures from other reviews, and it didn't seem too bad to me. I was pretty skeptical of course, and was afraid of walking into a horrible room. Well we arrived to Vegas on a Wed, late evening, check in was a flash and we right away got our keys.We went up to our Deluxe room on the 16th floor, and i could right away tell the difference of the clean non smokey smell up there. Our room was amazing, we had a king bed which was very comfy, and very very clean, and the room smelled very very clean as well. I felt like I wasn't even in a hotel with a casino in it. I don't know why people give so many bad reviews. I guess if you plan to stay in the Capri rooms which are cheaper, and in the motel part of the property, then yes, you might have some complains. But we decided to spend a lil more and go for the deluxe room! For 3 nights, the whole stay cost us only $118. We will definitely be going back to The Imperial Palace whenever we head back to Vegas! Its the cheapest, cleanest most comfortable place on the strip!"
138,376,"Aug 29 2009 	Great Location Great People Below Average Facility	For a hotel in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip, this is dissappointing.Service was great, casino dealers good (except the one crap table, where one of the money guys kept hitting the die with his hand!). Food choices were not good. Room was clean but basic (small TV, toilet ran a lot, shower didn't drain well). Location is the strength: it's right in the middle of the Strip. You can walk to a lot of great places like the Bellagio, Ceasar's, Harrahs, ...Dealertainers in casino were fun. Others, not so much. Overall you have to decide if the location and the really cheap rates are worth a crummy room..."
139,376,"Aug 26 2009 	Great Value. Would stay here again.	We live next to Vegas in Henderson. We decided to stay on the strip for my birthday instead of risk driving home after an evening of drinking and playing tourist. After reading other reviews, we were prepared for the worst, but figured we could stand anything for just one night.We arrived around 3pm on a Monday and only had to wait 5 minutes to check in. We were very pleasantly surprised as to the cleanliness and size of our room. We had a king bed and there was still plenty of space for my wife to drive her mobility scooter around. It was a nonsmoking room and there was absolutely no smell of cigarette smoke. Our 11th floor room overlooked the pool which seemed very popular.There were a few minor negatives though. The elevators were slow and very small (wifes mobility scooter just barely fit.) Finding the self parking garage was a challenge. There was no in-room coffee maker. (There was an iron, ironing board and hair drier though.)Overall, we felt that is was worth much more than the $30 locals special rate we paid. The location on the strip across from Caesars Palace and just a short walk to Bellagio, Mirage and Treasure Island cant be beat. We will stay at the Imperial Palace on our next mini stacation."
140,376,"Aug 26 2009 	Whats everyone complaining about?	I cannot stand people who do not do research before hand then write bad reviews because it is not what they expected. This was my first time in Vegas, as long as I had a room to sleep and to put my belongings then I was happy. The hotel is awesome location, central strip and very cheap among other hotels on the strip. So why is it that people think they are staying in a 5 star hotel for that cheap of a price? I was very happy with the service, very happy with the location, and very satisfied for a bed and a bathroom for the price I paid. You do not come to Vegas to stay in your room and complain about the tv..get out and enjoy the city."
141,376,"Aug 25 2009 	No frills - great location	Firstly a great location - right opposite Caesars Palace on the strip. Much better placed than some of the other alternatives such as Circus Circus. Room was clean, but could have been much better. Shower tap not working properly and some cracks/chips in the bathroom. Compared to one of my friends experience we had a good room. Some of the others in my group had rooms that overlooked a carpark or looked straight into a wall, whereas I got a room which overlooked the pool. Air conditioning is very noisy.The biggest gripe i have about this place is the lifts. It often took up to ten/fifteen minutes of waiting for the lifts and it became a joke with all the other guests staying there. So if you have any place to be/to go make sure you allow for this!!In summary, If you want somewhere central, thats cheap and are willing to forgo the extras then this is an okay place to stay. We spent so much time out and about that we hardly spent much time here so it worked for us. If you want some luxury and relaxation time, i would personally stay somewhere else."
142,376,"Aug 23 2009 	Awesome	Excellent customer service from front end staff, bar service quick, polite and friendly. Valet service quick and informative. Awesome room, simple and clean. Great view of the strip. Location is prime and the hotel has a simple feel to it. The size makes things easy and you can't get lost. Vegas can turn into a headache and this hotel puts your mind at ease. It was a grat place to stay and I am staying there again this year!"
143,376,"Aug 23 2009 	Loved it and can't wait to go back :)	I went last September with my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend. When we got to the IP it was about 19:30-20:00. And there was a line up to check in but it went smooth and fast. Our rooms were right next to each out which was great. He had to wait a bit for the elevator, but that was fine because it gave us a chance to meet other people a staff.Once we got up to our room the view wasnt the best and there were a few unknown hairs in the bathroom.but that wasnt a problem because we went in changed and headed to the strip, my boyfriend wasnt feeling well so unfortunately it was an early night.The next morning I went to the check in counter and advised then that we didnt like our view and the bathroom was a little messy. So apologized and apologized and asked how fast can we be packed up to move because she has two rooms next to each other that we could take right now. When we switched rooms it was awesome. It was a high floor and you could see the strip but couldnt hear the noise. Food was awesome and staff/bar tenders/security/valet and store clerks were awesome.As a travel agent I recommend this hotel to a lot of other agents and clients. You cant go wrong with the IP, the location is AMAZING. The day we were checking out our plane didnt leave till later that day. So there was a room where we could safely keep our stuff so we could kill time with out dragging it around.We are going back this Sept and are staying there again. The way I see it, youre not going to SIN CITY for the hotel, youre going for SIN CITY. Less money paid for the hotel more money to do things.I give this hotel 10 out of 10 :)"
144,376,"Aug 23 2009 	Terrible place to stay	I went with three friends for four days of Las Vegas fun. We had a good time in Vegas but the IP is a dump. The staff was less than helpful and on our last night all four of us ate at the Pizza Palace Restaurant at the Imperial Palace. Three of us shared a pizza and ended up with severe food poisioning. The paramedics were called and we all suffered because of the bad food at the Pizza Palace Restaurant. We missed our flight because of the sickness and the Imperial Palace had the nerve to charge us for the room for the extra day. In addition, never did anyone from management contact us in our room to see if we were okay or offer any kind of assistance. I have tried to contact Risk Management at the IP to try to get the room charge for the extra day to be removed to no avail. I have left messages and then called and the phone just rings. It has been a week and my friends and I are still not well. DON'T STAY HERE. The room was overall &quot;well worn&quot; and that was an upgraded room. The TV was about a 13&quot; TV.Well I will keep on trying to contact the IP management re the room charge."
145,376,"Aug 21 2009 	Great Location Great Casino Great Value!	I stayed at the Imperial Palace in Feb. 2005 and loved it, so of course when I went back this past week for the first time in 4 years, I decided to stay again at the Imperial Palace. After reading some less than stellar reviews, I got a bit worried, though. I'm glad I went with my instinct and not with the lame reviews of the IP. This place is great! It's located in the center of the strip, the staff was great, the rooms were clean (AND CHEAP!), and the casino was a blast! The Dealertainers were so much fun...play blackjack with Tony Orlando, you won't regret it (he dealt until my shuttle showed up, and if it weren't for his tips, I wouldn't walked out of there with more money than I started with)! The rooms were clean. Of course they're dated, but what do I care about that? I just wanted a clean room, clean bed sheets, and clean shower. All of which were available to me. Do not believe the garbage people are saying about the Imperial Palace. Sure, there was a slight wait for elevators during peak hours, but I waited no more than 3 minutes for the elevator at any time. All seemed to be working to me, so I'm not sure why people are still there are many out of order. My opinion, if you're young, and all you want is a clean/cheap room, the Imperial Palace is the place for you. I will stay here again when I go back to Vegas...hopefully it'll be much sooner rather than later."
146,376,"Aug 21 2009 	Hotel badly in need of renovation.	I don't quite know how to describe this place. It's the trailer park of the Las Vegas Strip.First of all, the positive of this place is LOCATION! You couldn't pick a better location period. But I have stayed here twice and each time has had its different miseries.The entire hotel and casino in general is extremely dated and dirty. It was probably a nice place back in the '70s or '80s... and it honestly looks and feels as if it has had absolutely maintenance since then!!You have to wait in LINES (long lines - literally) to access the main elevators. I waited once for twenty or thirty minutes. Entire place is congested period. Just checking in can instantly put you in a bad mood.Bar and restaurant staff are not friendly at all. Security, card dealers and other staff members equally unhelpful and most act as if they hate their jobs. Each of IP's restaurants that I have tried have not simply been BAD, but VERY NASTY period. I sincerely hope that some day soon a better chain will purchase this place and do a floor to ceiling renovation. It sucks that the best location on the LV Strip is occupied by such a Hellhole. People say, &quot;it's good for a tight budget&quot; or &quot;it's a good 21+&quot; hotel. I completely disagree. I have stayed cheaper at both Riviera and Treasure Island. As far as being a good &quot;Sin City&quot; adult establishment, it's just a judgment call. You can get anything you want anywhere on the Strip as long as you feel like walking or making a phone call.I'm not giving them a third chance."
147,376,"Aug 20 2009 	Great location and not as bad as others say	I was worried about staying here after reading some reviews but we had a great stay overall. It is in the best location, right across the street from Caesers and close to other newer hotels. We had a quick check in at 1pm on a Sunday and they gave us a room that was ready. No big waits with the elevator but they were not all working. Our room was on the 10th floor and was clean and comfortable. We had trouble with our tv the first night and they sent someone up within 15 minutes to fix it. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as was the concierge. Pool area was not nearly big enough and not much shade so we didn't even use it. Had the breakfast buffet once, lots of choices, service was okay. HIghly recommend renting a car for a day and going to Red Rock Canyon and then to Hoover Dam, it was nice to get off the strip."
148,376,"Aug 19 2009 	Fun budget Hotel	Fun and friendly, if your looking for class go elsewhere.This Hotel is great if on a budget even though its allot older than others on the Strip. Central location is perfect for getting around, staff are fun and friendly, food was good. Not as stuffy as some of the bigger hotels with a relaxed atmosphere. Rooms adequate and clean but did feel a little old. Beware if your room is situated out the front of the building as we asked to be moved due to the loud music coming from a tent below which would go on all day until late at night. Once moved to the back of the hotel was lovely and quiet, also lifts can be annoying as they seem to stop on every floor. But for the price and location you couldnt ask for a cheaper hotel.Also some of the surrounding Hotels are equally budget, but within a short distance of Caesars and other larger hotels. Check out Oshays $1 beer and the leprechaun."
149,376,"Aug 19 2009 	Not Worth Your $$$$$$$	It was my second time going to vegas and my first time experiencing it the way it's meant to be seen I was over 21! well, I went with my boyfriend, brother and my best friend and we booked at the Imperial Palace we saw the virtual tour on the website and we thought it looked nice.....well our trip finally came and we were so stoked however, from the minute we walked in we knew something wasn't right...check-in wasn't long however the person who helped us could have been new on the job because he didn't know anything!We were offered a chance to get a upgraded room however we declined it would have been an extra $80.00 and we wanted to save as much money as we can....well we were given our key and then told where our room was well come to find out it was wayyy out on the other side of the casino it overlooked the parking structure...we walked in and were immediately shocked by what we saw the tv was a small 19' television and the TV had a Nintendo 64 controller hooked up to it (that was weird). The carpet was worn and it left black stains on my socks so I learned very early on to keep my shoes on until I went to sleep! The bed was comfortable the room service was great but our first night there we went back to our room and we heard a bunch of people laughing and yelling and it turns out one of them punched out a window and left a trail of blood out on the floor! whoever that was I hope they went to the hospital! It really shocked me and my boyfriend that's not something we really expected. Well the next morning I went into the restroom and the floor was totally wet...the toilet was leaking (disgusting) we called the front desk they said they would fix it but no one ever came to our room! Besides our hotel room being a complete diaster it was a fun trip but I do recommend staying somewhere else it was not worth your money! trust me"
150,376,"Aug 18 2009 	Great for young people trying to save some $$$	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Imperial Palace Aug 14-17. The location could not better be. It is literally in the middle of the strip. An easy walk to every big casino. We arrived at the hotel at 6:45 pm and only waited 5-10 minutes to check-in. It was very quick. The room was simple, but clean. I only waited twice for the elevator, but I found it quicker to walk down the stairs and only ride up the elevator to avoid the wait. We ate at two restaurants late night at the hotel. Both were ok for late night food. The casino floor was always full of a good crowd, but I never had trouble finding a seat to place a bet. I would definitely stay here again. It was very inexpensive and did not dissappoint me."
151,376,"Aug 18 2009 	Not that bad	I was VERY skeptical when we reserved this hotel in Vegas. I was sooo worried about the rooms and the things everyone was saying about it. It is true that you get what you pay for and if you want newer hotel then this is not it. It is not Caesars Palace or the Bellagio but it wasnt that bad. If somehow you end up in the back of the hotel, good luck finding the front, it is a good distance and depending on what time you come in there will be NO ONE to guide you. All in all, it wasn't that bad. We did not eat at any of the restuarants inside the hotel, simple because we were on the go the entire time. The casino was PACKED every night. It was unbearable. Im not sure if it was because of the low table limits or if it was because of the &quot;dealtainers&quot;, they were great. They definitely keep you smiling and laughing. The check-in process was a bit long but the second the line got long, there were 6 desk clerks that came from the back to make the check in speed up. We checked in on a Friday night around 10pm and waited about 35 minutes. The elevators were NO problem, considering how crowded the hotel was and never once did I feel unsafe in them even when it was crowded. They came quickly when we called for them. The room was great. We had room 1893 (2 queens) and it was very clean and tidy. The housekeepers came and did an excellent job each day. I have only one complaint when it comes to the room, the television. It was like a 15 inch tube television with 12 channels, it ------.. Then again, who goes to Vegas to watch television.Overall this hotel wasn't that bad at all. I would definitely recommend it and I definitely would stay there again. If I ever go back there and I need an inexpensive, decent place to stay, this is it."
152,376,"Aug 17 2009 	Not as bad as made out to be	This was our 1st stay in Vegas and as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary we wanted to spend more of our money on shows and tours so the Imperial palace was the right chose. Having read most reviews expected a long wait to be checked in , this did not happen we flew from the UK and there was only one other couple in front of us. At check in she told us our room number and asked us to make sure we were happy with it as we were staying 10 nights, it was fine not posh but clean and tidy. The maids were good and kept the room clean daily and i asked for extra pillows and got them. Did not have a strip view as were informed could be noisey we were on the 9th floor overlooking the monerail and mountains again ok. We did eat there a couple of times the Tea room average no problems, burger palace yes the burgers a little bit dry but were given plenty of sauces,The buffet only had brunch there fine plenty of choice. Our 10 day stay there was great a very comfitable hotel yes not ceasers not belligio if you want their services then expect to pay for them if all you want is a clean room to lay your head and get out to explore its a great location to be in."
153,376,"Aug 17 2009 	Loved it!!!!	I honestly don't get the bad reviews of IP! yeah it's a dive...but a fun dive!We've stayed in bellagio wynn, thehotel and a bunch of other much fancier places but this time we blew the budget on ufc tickets so decided to go cheap with the accom...and we are so glad we did!The rooms were true motel wuality...but you get a balcony!which was pretty cool.The pool music was super loud and everyone seemed to be having a great time...sure it's only a plain smallish pool but it was alot of fun!I think fun is what sums up IP. It was typical kitschy,trashy vegas fun and we loved it. Where else do you get to get dealt blackjack from dolly parton and hug michael jackson?I wasn't brave enough to eat there (one has to exercise caution) but the central strip location for such a good price really cannot be beat...as long as it's around i'm going to stay there for sure!would rather spend the extra money across the road at the forum shops!On the slight downside the place reeeeeeked of years of serious smoking dedication...hallways,non-smoking rooms you name it.If you can't handle that look elsewhere. Like everyone else says elevators were annoying but there's a few sneaky ones round the back that went a little faster...but it was pretty frustratingwaiting up to 10 mins for lifts.The bars in the casino are pretty bad too...head elsewhere to eat and drink!I actually found everyone from check in guy(who stopped for 10 mins to talk to us about australia!) to cleaners sooo polite...much more so than over at some of the fancier hotels...everyone was really lovely and had a big smile for us!even fellow guests were great...especially the super drunk ones in the hallways :)If you are looking for fun vegas at a cheap price look no further than IP!"
154,376,"Aug 17 2009 	Don't eat there!!!!	If you are looking for the best value on the strip, than the Imperial Palace is great! It was very inexpensive for the great central location. The room had peeling wallpaper, and a constant running faucet. You definately get what you pay for the room. The elevators are definately not well planned. We averaged 15-20 minutes to get from the 10th floor to the lobby. The stay was very cheap, so I suppose drawbacks are to be expected. DO NOT EAT AT THE TEAROOM!!!!!!!!!!!! I went for a bachlorette party, and myself and the bachlorette spent most of our weekend in the drab room with what we think may be a parasite infection from the food at breakfast at the Tearoom. Aside from leaving breakfast with a racing heartbeat and shaking we spent most of the weekend sick to our stomaches in the hotel. It's 4 days later, and I am seeing a doctor in the morning. DO NOT EAT THERE! The hotel in general is a great value if you are on a budget. The location was perfect, so if that is what you are looking for, try a few extra bucks and make your vacation worth it at Caesars Palace across the street. And....if you do stay there......DO NOT EAT THE FOOD!!!!!!.......and please request and extra roll of toliet paper."
155,376,Aug 16 2009 	Quiet Room with No View	We just returned from a wedding trip to LV (not ours). We stayed at the Imperial. Reviews were accurate and helpful. Location was wonderful. Everything is a twenty-minute walk (or 45-minute cab ride). Concierge found us good tickets to a show. Elevators were slow but our non-smoking room (which was actually smokefree) was on the third floor so we just walked down when we were leaving and when we were coming back the slowness was not a big deal. Bathroom was clean although the drain was slow. I did check the linens for hair but they were clean. Plenty of towels and our room faced the parking garage so it was perfect for sleeping at night. Main concern: the lobby was smoky. Many of the newer hotels have MUCH better ventilation systems but it definitely met our neeeds.
156,376,"Aug 16 2009 	Never again....	I was getting ready to go to bed around 1:30 AM when I heard a &quot;girgling sound&quot; from the bathroom. I go to the bathroom and that's when I saw the clogged stuff coming from the drain and the bathtub started to fill up with water and all kinds of grime, dirt and all that was gross and colored brown and black!!! It would not stop (and no the tap water was not on), and next thing the bathtub was fillng almost to half of the tub!! I called the front desk and they sent maintenance up. He could not fix the problem obviously it was that big of a problem so he needed to get some more tools. This is now 2:15 Am. We talked to the maintenance guy (he was wonderful and very professional and worked so hard) and decided it was best to be moved.  Called the front desk and asked to be moved, explained the situation to them. Guess what their response was??? &quot;I have no room for you!!&quot; So they told us to ask the maintenance guy how long this was going to take etc.. We talked to the maintenance guy and his immediate response was: &quot;Oh yes they will have a room for you.!!!&quot; Thanks so much for this Mr. Maintenance, we would not have been able to convince the arrogant bunch working at the front desk if it were not for your help.Front desk people said the best they could do was a $15 credit on our food! No thank you we said I needed to use the shower and we could not even use the bathroom. For all is concerned staying in that room with all the filth coming up from the drain was too disgusting of an experience (apparently according to maintenance guy the main pipe connected to other rooms were clogged). So he talked to the front desk and said &quot;YOu have to move these people, this job could take 30 minutes or 24 hours or three days.&quot; The fact that the maintenance guy had to advocate on our behalf speaks to the kind of bad service and dismissive attitude provided by the front desk people. So sure enough they had a room for us. But we waited for three hours until we finally got out of our room, since nobody came up till then to give us the key to another room. We had gone down to get the key ourselves but they instructed us to wait in our room. By the time we got into our new room it was 6AM. Oh, and we did get a $15 food credit. I do question the professionalism of the front desk people and management. The fact that the room was booked through the internet and therefore was on a cheaper rate, does that render then some kind of unequal service that we do not deserved to have our needs and our concerns met particularly on this awful mishap???I have to applaud however the maintenance guy who worked dilligently to have the problem resolved. But two thumbs down for the management.I stayed at another hotel after that. On the way home to the airport I was having a conversation with the shuttle driver and he told me that he has heard terrible things about this hotel. So there you go."
157,376,"Aug 15 2009 	Buyer Beware!!!	I booked a package deal through LasVegas.com, and it is true that you get what you pay for. Originally, I booked a Deluxe Room which was anything but deluxe. The room reminded me a scene from a horror movie! The bed was hard as a rock, the pillow cases had mascara on them, the room was dirty, and it had a wonderful view of the casino roof. The air conditioner sounded like a low  flying bomber making a final approach. Fortunately we were able to upgrade to a Suite Room which was closer to what I has envisioned a deluxe room would look like. The room still was not as clean as we would have liked  but we were comfortable and the housekeeping staff were wonderful, as were all the staff we had dealings with. Dining was also a little different. The buffet had good  average food, but the atmosphere reminded me of a college cafeteria. We ate at the Paris buffet one night and found it much more appealing. DO NOT EAT AT THE OVERNIGHT BURGER BAR! If you do  practice your Heimlich maneuver before doing so. We had cheeseburgers were so dry that we could not finish them. There was no dressing of any type on them, and ketchup was the only condiment available at the self  service area. After tossing them I went to the counter for a soda refill and I noticed the staff had mustard and relish available behind the counter. I asked why they didnt have it out front for us to use. The answer was we have it for you behind the counter.cheap, cheap, cheap! The elevators were SLOW AND OUT OF ORDER! We walked down to the lobby to save time, but waited and waited to ride them up to our seventh floor room. We plan to stay somewhere else next time we are in Lost Wages, Nevada!"
158,376,"Aug 15 2009 	I've stayed in better for free	Checking in at the service desk was slow. Employees changed shifts while lines were long, and once they finished their last check-in they simple just walked away never stating &quot;someone will be right with you &quot;. They just let us stand there never acknowledging we were standing there. After getting our key and waiting at least 10 minutes for a elevator to go to our room, we found the carpet was very dirty and filthy. It was the same in the hallways too. The bed spread and curtains were very dull, and faded, and the room was dark. Although the room was over the pool, we requested a room change. The second room was also dirty. The bathroom was not clean, the toilet was dirty. Someone's feces was left on the handle, and along the bottom of the toilet. Towels from previous guest left hanging on the shower, and the tub was dirty. Not to mention 19 inch T.V's Come on now, what hotel still has 19 inch T.Vs. There were no coffeemakers or microwaves in the rooms, and no complimentary coffee in the casino. A non-working ice machine and it's 104 degrees. We eventually requested another room change. We actually had 3 different rooms. The lady at the front desk stated the rooms were all the same, and haven't been upgraged in about 5 years. I have stayed in better hotels for free. Don't fall for the internet photos because the rooms look nothing like them now. I would not recommend this hotel to my worse enemy."
159,376,"Aug 15 2009 	Very clean great value brilliant location	I stayed in the Imperial Palace for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago (August 09). Apart from the fact that the elevators did take ages, everything else was perfect!! There were 7 of us and each of the 4 rooms were extremely clean, quiet and very comfortable to stay in. Also, the hotel is in the perfect location- right in the middle of the strip! And as for the price, it was great value! What more could you ask for!? I would definitely recommend this hotel."
160,376,"Aug 15 2009 	should've stayed at hooters	room was dirty! Parking was a pain. No coffee pot in room, what's up with that? Had to have a pot sent to room 6.00. Elavators very slow. Hotel staff was great. Watch out for people selling timeshares. Met couple who's whole day was ruined dealing with timeshare company for just a free diner. Visited friend staying at Hooters. His room was clean and at a great location."
161,376,"Aug 14 2009 	Hotel worked great for us	I was hesitant to stay here after reading the reviews, but couldn't pass up the cheap rates combined with the mid-strip location. This was my 4th trip to Vegas so I knew location was everything, and also that I wasn't going to spend much time in my room. Our room wasn't impressive in any way, it was pretty standard but clean enough. Two beds and a (very small) balcony that overlooked the pool. We had no problems with our bathtub/shower. We had an iron, as well, which worked fine. I can imagine, though, in this older, cheaper hotel the rooms vary quite a bit in cleanliness, smell, etc.The best thing about the hotels is the location, right in the middle of the strip -- across from Caesar's, near the Mirage, short walk to Venetian and all the others. O'Shea's next door is lots of fun if you want to play beer pong or flip cup.The drawbacks to the hotel (I will echo others here) are the elevators. They were extremely slow! We snuck up the stairs on more than one occasion, but the other reviewer's are right, the stairs are usually locked. The parking lot is weird but I flew in so this wasn't a problem (I would highly recommend the airport shuttle if you are arriving alone, it is cheaper than a taxi and stops at most major hotels, though it takes longer).Another thing I like is since the hotel isn't as huge as some of the others, it is easy to quickly pop back up to your room if you're walking up and down the Strip (assuming the elevators cooperate). Plus, you have impersonators at the tables and although they aren't the best, it is entertaining to see who's there. The hotel doesn't have as many amenities as the larger ones (the casino is quite basic, not a lot of dining options, the rock bar &quot;club&quot; in the front wasn't great, etc.), but all the larger ones are close by.And finally, for your night owls, our favorite thing about the Imperial Palace was the $5 late-night breakfast special!! We had this almost every night we were there -- $5 for a full breakfast (pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash browns) -- and it is served late at night. I can't remember the exact hours, probably 2-5 a.m. or something. Great for drunk people coming back to their hotel hungry! (I hope they still have it when I go back this fall!)Oh, and the hotel allowed me to check my bags after checkout in a storage room, as I had a late afternoon flight. This is nice for those in my same situation. And it was free.In short, if you are looking for no frills, cheap and convenient -- and don't plan on spending too much time in your room or your own hotel, the Imperial Palace is a good deal."
162,376,"Aug 14 2009 	Do not stay here... ever!	I could go on and on, but I am still so PO'd that reliving it might send me into an apoplectic state; so, I'll keep it short.Other than the fact my sheets were clean (I think), everything else about the hotel was pathetic. Service was lousy, floors were filthy, employees (with two exceptions) seemed to not want to be there, most things didn't work properly (remote control, TV, ice machines, sliding doors on balcony, elevators, drains in bathroom, and so much more), food was awful, beer at bar was warm, and other than that everything else was incredibly unpleasant. The reason for writing this review is that some people claim to have had an OK room; I can't believe that after speaking with people who were staying there, and seeing the sour faces on these people (one person told me that his room opened up into the parking garage; yes, look up room 108 and you'll find he wasn't kidding). So, I don't want anyone falling for internet photos, or reviews from 'friends of the hotel' persuading people to try it - it can cause such a let down to one's entire vacation. I ran into two young guys from England who were miserable because they had a non-cancel clause, not much money to switch hotels, and they found themselves in a stink-hole. A woman told me she had to lay down towels all along the path she took after her shower because she didn't want her feet to touch the carpeting; in my room, the carpet by the sliding doors actually stuck to my shoes.I just hope this serves as a warning to everyone even thinking about saving a few dollars. DON'T DO THIS! And by the way, I am not a prima donna used to staying in 5 star hotels (though I have); when I used to travel a great deal for business, I would stay in Courtyards and Hampton Inns and places like those. The worst Courtyard I ever stayed in would be a ten-fold improvement over this dump.Other than that, I was able to enjoy Las Vegas... by staying away from the Imperial Palace until I needed to sleep."
163,376,"Aug 13 2009 	excellent situation and value for money	recently stayed for 6 nights, arrived late evening after long journey and didn't have to wait too long to check in, but did find the check in staff somewhat slow and not overly helpful. Having prebooked non smoking room seveal months in advance arrived only to be told there were non available, and yet other member of staff offering non smoking to someone else!! took room for the night but requested that be moved the next day and room was made available for us. Rooms cleaned daily, beds comfortable. Hotel is in excellent position on strip as central for all hotels and virtually centre so can get to either end with ease. Use the bus - Deuce $7 for 24hr unlimited use, this takes you up and down the strip, really useful to get to the Freemont Street Experience - not to be missed."
164,376,"Aug 13 2009 	OK but not really my kinda place	I checked into the IP on friday august 7th to attend a poker tourney at RIO. Check in was quick and was in my room by 11 am. Check in staff were polite and courteous. The room was in need of a refurb but it was clean and spacious. I noticed some things like cracks in the counter and rust stains around the drain but I am not put off by that as some people are. The room is cheap and for center of the strip no one should complain. If you require better accomadations pay better money. I found I was a little out of my element cause I am older and a bit of an early bird and I got up at 4 am one morning to go down to the casino and it was like a college party downstairs with more drunk 20 somethings and numerous fights in the casino.... Oh I remember those days problem is if I did that now I'd be hung over for a week . LOL and I hope I was never as embarrassing as those kids were LOL. If you only knew!!!!! I really enjoyed the casino staff , they helped make my time on the tables fun even if I was losing. The drink service was super , never once did I have to ask for a server. The one big complaint I do have is being an early bird myself I couldn't find a restaurant open in the hotel other than an all night burger joint which wasn't what I was looking for at 430 in the morning. The hotel is definately better suited for 20-30 year olds looking for a fun loose and cheap place to party on the strip. I don't begrudge them ....maybe I am just a little jealous....LOL. Would I stay here again.. probably not , but I do recommend it , for like I said , that 20 - 30 year old college crowd or group looking to party cheap on the strip. Rock on dude !!!!!!"
165,376,"Aug 13 2009 	Their slogan says it perfectly.	I am a Total Rewards member and was able to book a mid-week stay at Imperial Palace through the TR site for an unbelievably low price. I knew what to expect going in - nothing fancy, and that was true. But my experience overall was very good considering the price I paid. No major problems and only a couple minor annoyances.I stayed in a king bed room with a balcony and pool view. Again, nothing fancy, but everything that you need is there. The bed is fairly comfortable, there is a small 21 inch TV, the lighting is decent. There is a hair dryer and iron and ironing board provided in the room. Best of all, the room was quiet. Besides the room, the casino is decent but not one of my favorites on the Strip. What I've seen other people write about the elevators is very true - an extremely long wait if you try to take the ones next to the casino. I suggest walking further down the hall toward the parking lot, I found the wait to be much shorter there. The parking garage is also a little sketchy, with dim lighting and some foul smells. Last minor complaint - the pool is only open from 9-4:30. I thought these were extremely limited hours. For what I paid, I would have been happy with less than what the hotel offered. I got a clean room for cheap, and the location can't be beaten. Right across from Caesar's Palace in the center of the Strip. The hotel's slogan says it perfectly - &quot;Good fun. Great Value. Perfect Location.&quot; They know how to market themselves. It's nothing fancy, but it's a fine place to stay without spending much or having to worry about driving home (or paying a lot for a taxi ride) after a night on the Strip."
166,376,"Aug 12 2009 	You get what you pay for - what a dump	Great location. That is the only good thing I can say about this hotel. Our &quot;deluxe&quot; rooms, which were &quot;recently renovated&quot; were actually renovated about 5 years ago with what looked to be like junk from my grandmother's garage sale in 1985. The furniture was nicked everywhere, and the chairs in the room had stains on them - disgusting stains. There was a tiny TV on top of the bureau which I didn't hang around long enough to see if it even worked. The carpets were vacuumed but filthy, the balcony had bird droppings all over it, and the pool area was sparse - absolutely no atmosphere. The halls had a weird chemical smell which none of us could identify. I was supposed to stay here for 4 nights but said no way, and moved to the Flamingo next door. Yes, the Flamingo was more expensive but worth every single penny, especially since we upgraded to the &quot;newly renovated&quot; rooms which actually WERE renovated beatifully. I'm no high roller but it was my vacation, I was here for 4 days, and no way would I spend it in this [--]."
167,376,"Aug 12 2009 	Perfect for anyone on a budget	We were not expecting great things from the Imperial Palace as we paid very little for 4 nights here, however what a surprise to have such an awesome room, which had a balcony, two double beds, cable tv, a great bath/shower, huge sink area with massive mirror, and much more. Apart from the decor being a little dated it was very clean and had everything we needed. When you walk outside you are literally opposite Caesars Palace, and so close to everything else, I am still shocked at how cheap it really was! We had a fantastic time staying here, the swimming pool is quite simple but fine for what a pool can be! They had to handle a bit of drama when I was at the pool one of the days when a guy threw some stuff from his balcony at the top as he was locked out, which actually could have caused major harm to anyone below- the security staff and pool staff dealt with this very well and quickly. The only thing they could actually improve on is the speed of the lifts, there are generally queues to go up in them!Make sure you check out the impersonators in the casino, they are hilariously awful :)"
168,376,"Aug 12 2009 	Could Not Ask For More	I love the I.P. Just returned from a 4 night trip and was not disappointed at all. We arrived very late and our room was not available; were upgraded to a pool side room at no additional cost!! It was a smoking room, but you could not tell or smell old smoke in there. The A/C worked very well. The room was kept clean, the shower was incredible. I will say parts of the hotel are out dated, however it's nothing that even warrants complaining about. Check in was a snap, express check out kept us out of the long lines. The Dealertainers were awesome. We even saw Michael Jackson giving directions to some lost guests. Can't say enough good things about I.P. Perfect location, friendly and helpful staff!! We will be back!"
169,376,"Aug 12 2009 	Great location but tired rooms...in need of a refurb	I am a travel agent and loved the location of this hotel, but the rooms were very old and in need of a refurb. Bed linen was quite old and balcony doors did not shut in our 1st room. We asked to swap and they gave us another room....again the balcony doors did not close properly (quite noisy at night). We gave up and just settled for the room as we were not planning spending much time there anyway.I tend not to recommend this hotel to my customers now, but it is great if you are on a very tight budget. Spend an extra 50pp and get a nicer hotel, it will make your holiday!"
170,376,"Aug 11 2009 	Not the best place to stay	Centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip between Harrahs and the Flamingo. This hotel's entrance is set back from the strip and not well marked. I pulled into the parking garage which was also a bit of a maze. After completing this little habitrail experience I then had to make my way back to the hotel and casino area to find the front desk for check in. There was a massive line at check in and it seemed the entire south central LA scene was there. After :45 minutes I was finally able to check in. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodated my room upgrade request without any hassle whatsoever. I stayed in the King Suite. Back through the hotel again to the elevators. The elevators here are dire need of upgrading. They are old and slow and there are regularly lines of up to :10 mins just to wait on an elevator which would show up full. The stairs are useless. As they only let you in at any floor but you can only get out on the first floor. The room was nice and moderately appointed. The TV was a 19&quot; tube TV and the remote had no batteries in it which made it useless as well. The rooms spa tub was massive and could easily accommodate 6 of your closest friends. The sofa in the living room also pulls out into a queen sleeper. As mentioned in other reviews the water drains extremely slowly in the shower/tub so even though you are in a 7'X5' tub you're gonna end up with water around your ankles. The room service menu was missing from the rooms notebook so I had no chance to test it out. The maids here pretty much sucked. They did not clean the room even though I put the sign out. They did come in and exchange the towels but did not do ANYTHING else including make the bed. Internet service is an extra $12.95 per day that is completely unacceptable in this day and age. The pool area was nice as far as being a large rectangle surrounded by concrete. The concrete coating however was very HOT and slippery, bring sandals! The bar area at the pool had lots of drink specials and the waitresses were very nice. The club at the Imperial is called Rock Band but it certainly did not play ANY rock music. The ladies I talked with here said that the guys in the club were overly aggressive and they did not have a good time. Overall not the best and not the worst. The best part about it was the central location."
171,376,"Aug 11 2009	Imperial Palace	We first arrived at the Imperial Palace around 4:15 pm. We had to wait about 20 minutes in line before being properly checked in. I thought that this was fine being that it was a Saturday and everyone was trying to get their room. We got to our non-smoking room and it reeked of smoke. I dismissed the smell because the young lady at the desk said that we could do an upgrade tomorrow for free. After getting settled, my husband checked the 9th, 10th and 11th floor for ice and all the machines were out of order. I didnt want to get irritated, so I called down stairs to ask where I could get some ice. After getting the run around, the manager finally pulled some strings and had room service bring up 2 buckets of ice, for free. Otherwise, they were going to charge me 5 bucks. As far as the room, it was old but despite the smell, it looked clean. The Imperial Palace is just an old hotel all together.The next day, we got our upgrade as promised and found the room was old but very nice. We had a mirror over our bed as well as a mirror over the huge Jacuzzi looking garden tube. It had a couple other nice things about the room as well. One thing that I liked about the hotel was the entertainment. They had several celebrity impersonators working as dealers at the casino and they would also do performances. My favorite was the Michael Jackson one whom really put on an excellent show. In the back of the casino area, they had a couple fast food restaurants, like Burger King or Subway, if you wanted to eat on a lower budget. Also, they had room for Beer Pong and other games. It kind of gave you a variety inside the hotel. As far as the restaurants, we didnt really get to eat inside because most of the time it was unappealing, closed or about to close. I think that the Imperial Palace is a good place to stay if you are not hung up on luxury accommodations. If you would like a nice clean place to stay and somewhere that people are having fun, try them. Its in the middle of the strip and not far from a good time."
172,376,"Aug 9 2009 	An unforgettable experience!	After parking our car in the parking garage, it took us about 10 minutes to find the check-in desk (as there were poor signs). When we got to check-in, we found it fairly quick and proceeded to the lifts. The lifts were very slow and some out of order (With no signs indicating this). One night we decided that we would use the stairs up to our room as we were only on the 5th floor and would be quicker, only to find the door locked when we reached our foor (this was the case for all floors). When we went back down the stairs we found the same people STILL waiting for the lifts!When we decided to get some ice, we found that the ice machines were broken and that the only ice machine that was working was on floor 8. This meant everyone cramming in the lift with ice buckets to the 8th floor!The shower was very powerfull, however, the water took about 10 minutes to run down the plug so you couldnt work out if you were showering or bathing.The room was good for the price..after all, you only really wash and sleep in it. The casino also smelt of stale smoke. Not sure i would want to stay here again. Will try out some of the other hotels."
173,376,"Aug 9 2009 	Good price and... on the Strip!	Good prices during the weekend considering you will be on the Strip in front of the Ceasar Palace (Friday-Saturday prices become very high in all famous hotel nearby).It is not a recent renovated hotel, but it is clean and staff is very helpful to satisfy your needs. I've been in Capri buildings 1 night (little motel inside the Imperial palace) and the room was very spacious and clean, but outside the door you have the garage and you have to walk through it to arrive inside the main hotel..btw this was not a big issue for me. 2nd night I've been in a suite of the Imperial palace, very spacious, with a big round dirty bath inside the room :-(So if you just want a clean hotel on the Strip with an affordable price this is for you!"
174,376,"Aug 8 2009 	Good 	4 women from Iowa traveled to the hottest place in the US for 3 days/4 nites thru Allegiant Airlines. None of us knew what to expect, all that mattered was memories were to be had and a great time doing so. We arrived very late in the evening, with no shuttle or check in problems. Our 12th floor room was located near the elevator and was clean and cool, and surprisingly, very quiet. The bed was comfortable and we always had clean towels. The Impersonators on the casino floor were a hoot and access to the rooms is easily loacted from the Casino front entrance. Yes, we had issues with ice, the entire place is outdated, and the elavators worked 1/2 the time, but if your plans are to actually enjoy LV, then none of this should matter. There is no better location than HERE, unless you are at the hotels across from or beside the Imperial. Shops, eateries, casinos, all easily accessible. I would highly suggest to first get a $15, 3 day pass on the Deuce double decker bus and you can get on and off the strip and downtown, it runs 24hrs. OR walk. I would probably stay here again knowing that I would be just as busy as I was this trip. The beds were very comfortable, the room was cool, the price was right, and that's all I required on this trip. We had a lot of fun even in the 110+ temps! A trip is what you make it! :)"
175,376,"Aug 5 2009 	Loved it !!	i stayed in room tr1619 from july 20th to june 23rd, my room looked like the online pics,and had all necessities,the most i waited for the elevator was 2 minutes.great location,staff and price.waited in check out line less than 30 minutes which is great if you have 20 people in front of you."
176,376,"Aug 4 2009 	Good Casino Horrible Hotel	First of all they have what they like to call the &quot;capri&quot; building and no one informs you until you arrive there that that means a motel in the back of the hotel. There is horrible cell phone service back there, there was hair in the shower of my first room, the TV did not work there are no bars to hang washcloths and towels, yet they ask you to help them preserve water buy reusing them. After I paid $20 to upgrade to be in the actual Imperial Palace Hotel, the room was identical to that of the motel so what did I upgrade? A quicker trip to the casino? The best thing about them is their location, and their overall layout which is easier to maneuver than some of the other casinos."
177,376,"Aug 4 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	After much reluctance in booking a stay at the IP (I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about this place), my boyfriend and I were set to experience what the IP had to offer. We had booked a Luv Tub room for 3 nights at $80/night for the end of July, and after waiting 45 minutes to check in and tipping the front desk clerk $20 bucks, we were given a KING SUITE. Sweet!! The line to check in was, granted, long, but the check-in process took no more than 10 minutes. So that was pretty good. After a walk that seemed to take forever, we finally reached the elevators. Just as I expected, only 2 were working. I found it rather entertaining to see a group of people waiting for 5-15 minutes for the elevator to come, only to have 50 people making a mad rush into the elevator before the doors close.We finally got to our room, and I was pretty impressed with the condition of the room. Sure, it may not be furnished beautifully like the rooms at Wynn or the Bellagio, but it was adequate. The Luv Tub was ginormous. My 6'3&quot; boyfriend could almost lie down without bending his knees on the bottom of the tub! There was also a separate living room with a sofa bed, which I found pretty nifty. We even had our own balcony, too. Not much of a view, though, unless you like some old half-naked man watching you from across. We were way up on the 17th floor so the noise level was very minimal. No complaints there. The casino was all right. I greatly disliked the amount of cigarette smoke in it (but then again, cigarette smoke is found in every Vegas casino, ha)..it just felt like there was 10x more smoke at the IP. Anyway, there were a lot of low-limit tables and games about which we found to be ideal since we're poor college students trying to find a game that won't make us any poorer.The Dealertainers were super friendly and some of them were very talented, even though a few looked NOTHING like who they were supposed to impersonate. Props to them for being awesome singers, though. I was quite entertained. Didn't try their buffet. It looked pretty empty, so I kinda took the hint that it was something I didn't want to invest my stomach in.Overall, it's a pretty decent hotel. It's old and in desperate need of a face lift, but hey, you do get what you pay for. The location of the hotel is so so convenient. Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, and other 5-star resorts are a 5-minute walk away. Now, how awesome is that? If you don't mind a little normal wear-and-tear, ridiculously slow elevators, and that old, corny Vegas charm, then the IP is the place for you. Plus, the IP is super cheap considering most visitors spend an average 5 hours in the room each day. It was definitely a good value."
178,376,"Aug 3 2009 	I'll stay at IP next time I'm in Vegas	My sister and I stayed 3 nights the end of July. We had to wait in line about 10 minutes to check in. People seem to complain about the elevators, but we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for one, and that was only 1 time. We were on the 7th floor poolside. I liked going out on the balcony to watch what was going on at the pool. Everyone seemed to be having a fun time. The casino was smoky but hey it is a casino. It was stuffy inside the casino as well, but I found it to be that way in most of them. Caesers Palace was the worst! I thought I would die before I got out of there! I think the A/C in the casino's were having problems dealing with the unusual humidity being experienced by Vegas while we were there. We ate breakfast in the Teahouse 2 mornings and the food was decent and a fair price. The room was fairly clean and I thought the bed was nice and comfortable. I like that IP is right in the middle of the strip. I would definitely stay there again. It was exactly what we were looking for."
179,376,"Aug 3 2009 	You could do better.	It was cheap. $98.00 for 3 days, but you get what you paid for. It is Las Vegas of course and you will be paying for everything. I was surprise to have to pay for shuttle pick up, fitness facilities, and internet access. You have no plans of staying in the hotel while you there anyway so if your looking for something very inexpensive and don't need all the simple things to make your life easier. This is the hotel for you. I have to do more research anyway, this was just a quick vacation. Next time I return to Vegas I will splurge a little."
180,376,"Aug 1 2009 	Still a good value	Wife and I got the &quot;luv tub&quot; room and liked it very much. The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well even with the 105degree weather. The room was clean and we had no problems with the service.The best features of this hotel were the center-strip location, and the low price.One down side was the really long wait to check in. We checked in about 5:00 pm on a Friday and the line was REALLY long. They had a security guard to keep people under control and plenty of desk workers, so the actual wait was about 40 minutes - much shorter that it first appeared.Another down side is the slow and overcrowded elevators. At certain times it seemed impossible to get an elevator. We finally found another bank of lesser-used elevators that were a longer walk away, but still a shorter wait.The casino is not really very big, but very popular (and crowded). Michael Jackson may have something to do with it's popularity.Parking was convenient, only because we rented a small car that could get into tight spaces. The parking garage is not well suited to large vehicles because of the tight turns and narrow parking spaces."
181,376,"Aug 1 2009 	If you are looking for Price and Place	I stayed 6 days in this hotel. I seems it is one of the oldest hotels of las vegas. Old fashion, Old style. if you are looking for price and you want to be close to everything this should be your choice. But you get what you pay. Low Price, low service and low luxury. The room was clean. I was all day out of the hotel and I never used any of the ammenities, like the swimming pool. I only went back every day to sleep."
182,376,Aug 1 2009 	great service great value great location	This hotel is ideally situated for everything on the strip.The service is terrific especially the waitreses.Watch the dealertainers they are very good.This hotel is not big by Vegas standards but is very homely.The staff are very helpful and polite.Lots of Penny slots to keep any one happy.Overall a brilliant holiday.
183,376,"Aug 1 2009 	Wouldn't stay here again	There's a reason that the Imperial Palace is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and that is because it's one of the oldest hotels on the strip, and it shows! Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first: First thing is the decor, I swear this place hasn't been re-modeled, repainted, re-carpeted, re-tiled or re-anything since it was built. Only half of the elevators work and are very slow. The carpeting throughout the entire hotel is dirty, torn and tattered. The paint on the walls is yellow due to all the nicotine and cigarette smoke which tells me that the ventilation system is out of whack. The rooms are clean however our air con unit was very noisy, our shower didn't drain until 10 minutes after showering, the balcony door didn't lock, there is no mini fridge in the room (that's a tough one to figure out) and again the decor is ancient. We had a room facing the strip on the 10th floor and I have to warn you that if you turn in before 3am don't count on any sleep before then because there is a bar right below the hotel that plays live music turned up to infinity until that time. Thank God we only retired to our room 1 night at around 1am. We also took notice of room service trays/dishes sitting in the hallway for 2 days before being picked up, can you say cockroaches, yikes! The pool is way to small for the size of the hotel and most of the deck chairs are broken. The restaurants are overpriced for what you get and they're tricky to find. We only ate at the hotel twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Now on to the good points: 1)Location is excellent. Center strip, but then so are a lot of other hotels. Ceasars is right across the road and so is the Mirage. 2)The monorail is right out the back door of the hotel and this connects you to other hotels along the strip from the Sahara at one end to the Luxor at the other. 3) The staff are all very courteous and helpful. Check in only took about 10 minutes and the maids always had a good morning for us. 4) The dealertainers are a blast especially the Britney Spears one that made my time at the blackjack table well worth while!In all honesty what the owner(s) of this hotel need to do is spend some of that cash they're raking in and level this place and build a new Imperial Palace, seriously! The place really is a dinosaur! They could build a new hotel that would rival any place on the strip. If your looking for a throwback to the early seventies then stay here but if you want something a whole lot better for not a whole lot more stay somewhere else. When we return to Vegas we will be staying at Treasure Island, Mirage, the Wynn, the Encore, the Venetian or Ceasars, anywhere but the Imperial Palace!I hope this review helps you in your decision."
184,376,"Aug 1 2009 	Do you expect any better for the price?	We have stayed at the Imperial Palace 3 times now. We really enjoy the atmosphere. Yes, it's smokey. Yes, it's older. But what do you expect when you pay so little. Imperial Palace is right in the middle of the strip. you are so close to other Casinos, shopping, and dining. We were not happy (with the view) so they changed our room 2 times. Now that's service! We like this hotel for affordability and location. How often do you actually stay in your room anyway."
185,376,"Jul 31 2009 	NEVER AGAIN !	Our first time to Las Vegas.. Expecting something wonderful from the reviews that had been previously read on this site.. Couldn't have been more wrong!The whole Casino-Hotel needs a facelift.. Lifts slow and often out of order.. Ice machines aways empty as with no mini fridge's in room (unless you pay an extra $10 a nite) ppl bring their eskies and fill them up with the ice..leaving no more ice !!! Food avail in the Hotel limited..No buffet breakfast,, Staff tired and overworked..Wallpaper comming off the walls, skirting boards kicked in with no attention to repair.. Pool area small and over-crowded no cover from the intense heat of July.. Perfect for young ppl who don't care about a little comfort.. As for us, and everyone I spoke to while staying there.. We will never stay here again..and I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone .."
186,376,"Jul 31 2009 	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!	When I first arrived, I waited for about a half an hour to check in. The line at the front desk is always long, no matter what time you walk by. Finally checked in and went to the elevators, and called the elevators, it took about 10 minutes for an elevator to come down. Went to my room and the iron was missing! So I called front desk and they asked if they may send someone up &quot;now&quot; with a new one. &quot;Now&quot; meant half an hour! before somebody came! The iron was ancient and the ironing board was so dirty that I had to put a towel over it, to iron my clothes. The iron was basically lukewarm, couldn't iron my clothes with it and opted for the old-school steamy shower method. That was the only time front desk picked up the phone when I called for the rest of the trip! In the evening we tried getting ice, the ice machine was broken. We tried the ice-machines on the 6 and 7th floor as well, with no luck. Upon reaching front desk, my friend was told to try the 4th floor! The funny part was, that in the evening you would see people running around the hotel with ice-buckets! We were there for 4 days and every day we had to use the ice-machine on a different floor. We asked for extended check-out on our last day and yet they still proceeded to lock us out after 11 o'clock. Called front desk to send somebody up with a key, and 15 mins later, no one showed up. My friend flipped out because she needed to catch a flight and decided to go downstairs and &quot;raise hell&quot;. Well, as she was going down on the elevator, it got stuck!!!! I talked to a few locals, one of them did some electrical work for Harrah's (which owns the Imperial Palace) and said he would never eat anything at these hotels ever again! Another local told me that it is and I quote &quot;The most ghetto hotel in Vegas! You're better off staying at a motel&quot; Take my advise and stay at Excalibur if money is an issue, although it's a little bit further down the strip, it'll save you lots of headaches!"
187,376,"Jul 30 2009 	Great Location	From a person who has stayed in many hostels, Imperial Palace is a dream. I opted to upgrade and recieved a king size bed. The air-conditioning worked very well considering it was 110 outside. The room was clean, well maintained. The best part was the location, right in the middle of the strip. You didn't have to walk too far to get cheap booze/meals/gambling as the hotel was ok for that but other places were better. I would recommend for anyone to stay here as long as they are not expecting the hilton. Checking in and out took no more than 5mins."
188,376,"Jul 30 2009 	You get what you pay for	Although the IP is a great location, and a great deal, my husband and I are willing to pay more in the future for a better hotel. When we got there, we waited for about 45 minutes to check in. The elevators took forever and were crowded the entire 4 days we stayed there. Elderly people were also waiting with their walkers in hand, to go down on the elevators, since they couldnt go down the stairs. What if there was a fire? These people wouldnt make it out alive. All of the elevators didnt even work. The ones that did, the doors kept getting stuck or they couldnt move. EVERYONE was complaining. Anyhow, our &quot;deluxe&quot; room this year was way worse than our standard room last year. None of the ice machines worked. A man came down from the penthouse because his didnt even work. The rooms were as clean as they could be i guess. Beds were uncomfortable, you could feel the springs all night long. The bathroom looked outdated, but the water pressure in the shower was great. We could have changed rooms, but to noisy ones facing the stip. We declined. All I can say is, you get what you pay for. It is very affordable and a great location, but thats about it. We wont be back."
189,376,"Jul 29 2009 	Could have been a lot worse	After reading the past reviews of this hotel, I was a bit concerned with what I would find upon my arrival. I was traveling with my daughter and meeting some friends who were staying at another hotel. I booked my reservations in April and had a &quot;non cancellation&quot; clause attached to my reservation. ....so some of the reviews scared me because we were staying for 4 nights. I mentioned this to the receptionist at check in and she gave us a nice room. My biggest concern was the cleanliness of the room, and I would like to start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised to find myself on a non- smoking floor that didn't have that lingering smoke smell that is often found in hotels, plus the room was very clean. The hotel is older, so the bathroom needed a little repair (sink crack), but it was still clean., and the maid came in daily to check on our supplies and make the beds. Our room had a little balcony that overlooked the pool and provided some free entertainment ; the music from the pool was upbeat, as were the poolside games. In the evenings, the room and hallway were both quiet. The free entertainment in the casino was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the impersonation shows and attended Human Nature, a motown review show that was awesome The concierge, Ryan, got us tickets in the front row, and we had a blast during the high energy show. The hotel is centrally located near all of the big attractions. We did find the buffet here to be lacking compared to others we have eaten at, but again, the price was lower. We had dinner at Toby Keith's bar and grille right next door and walked the block to Margaritaville and to watch the Bellagio water show. Caesars Palace and Forum are right across the street as well. The monorail runs from this hotel, so there is access to any hotel on the strip.....excellent location for the price!!!Okay, now for the downfalls.....only 2 out of the 4 elevators worked and they were always packed or very slow in coming; luckily we were on the 4th floor and used the stairs quite a bit. The same thing goes for the ice machine.....there was NO ice on our floor, and I had to trek the different floors to find ice, I actually believe only 3 floors had ice at any given time. ....kind of a necessity during the month of July! If you don't mind the inconvenience of ice hunting and using stairs, then I would say go for this hotel.Overall I would give this hotel a good rating for the price.....basically, you get what you pay for. If you want fancy pay the bigger dollar and head to one of the newer, bigger hotels. I think asking for a nice room at the beginning helped.....get the pool view!"
190,376,"Jul 28 2009 	Don`t be misled by negative reviews	My wife and i spent a week here after getting a cheap deal despite reading some negative reviews.What we found was a Hotel with a fantastic location right in the middle of the strip,rooms are clean and well serviced,staff are friendly and helpful. OK it`s not Caesars or the Bellagio or the MGM but more than good enough. Bettys Diner,Burger Palace and The Tearooms have good food at reasonable prices but in our opinion stay clear of the Pizza Palace all you can eat pasta as it was absolutely rank !.You really need to get out and about and prepare for some serious walking as Vegas is HUGE. Take advantage of the Deuce bus service which runs every 8-12 minutes and will take you all along the strip and further a field for $7 for a day ticket but make sure you visit Fremont which is on the bus route and is an absolute must for all your Vegas souvenier tack !!!!!! but a great light show and all the original Vegas hangouts,we can highly recommend the Bay Street Diner located in the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino,Have fun"
191,376,"Jul 27 2009 	Worst Hotel I've Ever Stayed In	I could not wait to leave this hotel. The elevators are unsafe, slow, kept stalling....a real hazard. There isn't even a coffee pot in the room....a very cheap place, indeed...and not clean. No matter what the rate...it is too high."
192,376,"Jul 27 2009 	Great value	I stayed at the Imperial Palace with my partner for five nights the week of July 4th and was a little leary after reading some not so good reviews. However, I know you have to take the best ones and the worst ones and just disregard them and go with those in the middle. You certainly can't please everyone. So I was pleasantly suprised. The hotel was a little gaudy, but nice and clean. And I found the staff there nicer and more pleasant than at any other hotel we visited during our stay. The rooms were clean, of average size and competely adequate. I was led to believe by Travelocity that our room would have a 42&quot; plasma television, which it did not. And when I called the front desk, they said they didn't have any rooms with 42&quot; tv's. And of course, it wasn't printed in my Travelocity itinerary, so beware of that. We went to the Luau that they have at the pool every Tuesday and Saturday and it was relaxing and fun. Not the greatest show, but worth the low cost. We got the VIP seating for this and were right up front. It included open bar, but they didn't allow you to order any top shelf booze in your drinks. I thought the pool was just fine, though it is ranked as one of the worse in Vegas. It of course is just a square pool, but I don't require anything fancy. Just some water, a bartender, towels and a lounge chair. I also had my lunch at the pool one day and it was very good and very reasonable. They offer 2 for 1 drinks at the poolside bar every day, each day is a different special. We ate at the Burger Palace and wasn't too impressed with that. We also had a few meals at the Teahouse which I thought was very good. We didn't try the buffet here because of the bad reviews. The dealertainers were just wonderful, it was quite entertaining even if you weren't playing cards at the time. Regarding the elevators, we were in a section of the hotel that uses the room elevators closest to the front desk, which aren't as busy as the main ones. We never waited more than two minutes for the elevators. So I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a bargain hotel in Vegas. That is pretty much what it is, nothing fancy, but a clean room with a comfortable bed with adequate space for two people."
193,376,Jul 27 2009 	Always a good time	I have never had a bad experience at this hotel. They have always been friendly and nice to me. The hotel is a little confusing but once you have been there a time or two you know whats going on. The dealertainers are always a good time. The elevators do take a little bit longer then I would like. But the location is amazing. You coudlnt ask for a better spot. Every room i have stayed in has been clean and people talk about how cheap it is....well you dont pay very much for a room are you thinking you are going to get a 5 star room? I love the IP they have always treated me very well and give me GREAT comps.
194,376,Jul 26 2009 	Great Location even better Price!	I have stayed at the Imperial Palace on three occasions and was happy with our rooms. For the amount of time we spend in our rooms it was comfortable and clean.We have stayed in the upgraded suites which we throughly enjoyed. Two Tv's couches and clean bathroom. The hotel and casino staff were awesome and extremly helpful. The only negative was the Timeshare vultures near the elevators......too pushy! I recommend this to all first time visitors as you cannot beat the price and location of The Imperial Palace.
195,376,"Jul 26 2009 	Imperial Palace? Try ""Imperial Prison"".	Seriously, I thought perhaps I had committed some terrible atrocity and was being punished. Okay, not really, but this hotel is awful. I had stayed here previously in 2003, and I honestly remembered the hotel as being no-frills but certainly not horrible. Alas, this time--I can safely say that no matter what a &quot;good value&quot; it might be, I am never staying there again.It's July in the desert, for one thing, but you'd never know it in the hotel. All the common areas were stuffy and hot, including the corridors, the elevators, and the stairwell. Why were you in the stairwell, you might ask? That would be because the elevators--all sixteen of them--were either slow or out of service (were there any signs indicated this service problem? No.), and while taking the stairs down isn't a problem, let's just talk about how much fun dragging four pieces of luggage down eleven flights of stairs is. It's not fun at all. :( Also, there was puke in the hallways from the night before, which added to the ambiance in a way I could do without. When I emerged from my journey down the stairwell with all my luggage, it was in a back alley outside the hotel, which meant dragging my luggage all the way round and going back inside the hot, stuffy lobby. I was never as happy as I was when the cab took us to Caesar's Palace (we booked IP because it was a cheap room on the strip on a Saturday night, before our much better deal at Caesar's started on Sunday). Additionally, the rooms are boring and beige. I'm not sure what is &quot;Imperial&quot; about this in the slightest. The pillows were ridiculous, too! They were more like a sack of hair than a pillow. Save yourself the trouble and either pay a little more for a better hotel, or book somewhere farther away and stay at the Motel 8. This place is seriously not worth the money (also, the pool closes at 5, wtf?) unless you think dragging your luggage down the stairwell is a fun time...."
196,376,Jul 26 2009 	friendly not over the top.	have stayed 5 times and would not go anywhere else. Geisha bar very friendly and hasnt changed - still same staff which says a lot. Betty's coffe shop - scrummy cakes! all floor staff very helpful and pleasant- maybe because we are Scottish! Don't go for expensive casinos - you pay for the glitz and VERY small drinks!!
197,376,"Jul 26 2009 	Will NEVER stay here again!	I read a lot of the reviews for the this place and decided to book because of the price and location.. unfortunately, the worst thing about this hotel wasn't mentioned in any of the posts I read. It began to rain Monday evening while we were driving back from the south end of the strip and by the time we pulled into the parking garage entrance, a very rude security guard first told us the garage was closed because of flooding and we couldn't go in. When my hubby told him this is our hotel, the guard tells us we could pay for valet parking and when this didn't fly with my husband, the guard gave us a long babel of directions to get to the back entrance so we could park. We get there, it's blocked, I call the hotel, he gives me &quot;employee parking&quot; directions which lead to the Harrah's parking garage, we get out, realize we are still on the other side of the gushing river flowing through the Imperial garage so would have to walk around the entire block to get to the entrance, my 3 year old is crying because he scared, my hubby calls the hotel again and the same guy tells us there is a security guard flagging people through to the garage, but we are standing here STARING at said guard telling people they can't go in. After we hang up, the hotel guy comes out (now realizing no one is being allowed in, though not admitting it during the call), talks to the guard and they go stand in the RIGHT place to flag people into the garage. I read this happens every time it rains and the hotel refuses to do anything about it, even though 2 other hotels that had similar problems have spent the $ to fix it. Needless to say, the lady at check-out didn't bother asking me how my stay was. This is a video of what it looked like.. it's not even my video but change daytime to nighttime and it's exactly the same. We were even stranded on the side of the river where the video was taken: [--]Other CONS:-Smelled like sewage every time I turned the faucet on -Waited a minimum of 4 minutes, as much as 10 minutes, for the elevators-Long walk from parking to check-inPROS:-Good location"
198,376,Jul 24 2009 	Smoky	Room was smoke free but it was too smoky walking through the casino and you can't get anywhere if you don't. Consierage was good! One day we had no maid service!
199,376,Jul 24 2009 	i would stay here again	I have stayed here for bout six year and have stood in other hotels sure no hotel is perfect but location is great rooms great for the stay clean and stocked ya elivators are slow but those are the ones by the shops there are other ones that are lot faster just need to look on the maps gambling is good low limit tables and the bar out side is fun casino at night is fun there is entertainment that make it fun i walk in to other casinos at night and not as fun compared to IP and the price is great for us non high rollers i have stayed at luxor and excaliber and mgm and other but i would rather stay were its right in the middle of the strip and not were half my money is tied up in a 5 star hotel were here to have fun and get away from everyday life and no one is really in there room but to shower and sleep and that only for a few hour if your here just to sleep and stay in just one hotel you should just stay at home. Ill be back at IP on the july31 for sure here i come
200,376,"Jul 24 2009 	Great Location	I took my daughter for her 21st birthday and was worried about the hotel I had chose. We loved the location of the hotel the best. The check in took a bit but they had a lot of people working and were doing there best so we were patient and it paid off. The room was clean and our balcony was overlooking the pool which was very nice. The only thing bad I ccould stay would be the elevators. Very slow! But other than that everyone was very nice and helpful. We did not encounter any rude workers just a couple of travelers. I would probably stay somewhere else next time just to have another experience but would recommend this hotel to anyone. I would recommend to eat else where. The food was not that good and very expensive. But, there are very close places to eat."
201,376,"Jul 23 2009 	Only reason to stay is location/price	We kinda knew what to expect when we booked a room at the IP for one night in July. However, we wanted to stay right off the strip without spending all our money on the hotel. We got our room two hours after the check in time and were downgraded to an older room which had not been renovated for quite some time. At least we were compensated with a voucher that almost covered entry to the great dinner buffet at the IP. Be prepared for hour long check in lines and poor service from tired staff. The location is spot on perfect, though. Stay only if you want good location at low price and don't care much about the hotel standard."
202,376,Jul 22 2009 	good hotel Great location and price we would definitely stay again	This was our third visit to Las Vegas and we have stayed at Harrahs for the past two years so this year we tried the Imperial Palace as it was half the price of Harrahs and for a change. There was no waiting time to check in and the Room was as good as Harrahs everything was nice and clean and the room was cleaned and fresh towels placed every day. The only slight problem was the elevators there were plenty to choose from but as they are quite small you had to wait a while for one to fit into to arrive. All the staff were friendly and the breakfast buffet was especially good in one of the restuarants. We would definitely stay here again and we stayed for 9 nights without any complaints.
203,376,"Jul 21 2009 	rotten check out attitude	i have stayed a number of times at the Imperial Palace because it is centrally located on the strip. However this last time, i could not believe when i checked out of the hotel, how rude and discourteous the hotel clerk was. I do not know what her problem was but she was so rude that i have decided that with the economy the way it is, i dont have to tolerate such ill mannered and rude behavior from a hotel employee As a result , i will never stay at the Imperial Palace again"
204,376,Jul 21 2009 	Excellant value for money and great location!	We stayed for 14 nights in the Imperial Palace - a long time for Vegas but never a dull moment. We got a taxi from the airport cost 30 dollars it would be difficult to find the hotel otherwise - on the strip the front of the hotel is the Rockhouse Club which is part of the hotel. You drive by the side of this to the hotel lobby. A wait of about 20 minutes to check in and we were upgraded without asking to the main building. The hotel is a little tired but excellant value and the staff very helpful and cheerful. The place was clean and tidy and gets a little rowdier over the weekends but all good fun. You can get into the Rockhouse nightclub free before midnight if you show a hotel room key and ladies drink free on Thursdays from 10pm. The pool are is also good fun - DJ plays on some days but doesnt start until after 11.30am - good idea when having so many late nights - even though we had view of the pool from our room the room seems very well sound proofed. The layout of the hotel is a little confusing but again added to the fun - everyone was in the same position - the lifts can also result in a wait but this was worse on the morning of our checkout - everyone wanting to use them at the same time. The location was incredible - walking distance to everywhere and the monorail is closeby if needed. All in all good value not the plushest hotel in the world but who spends all their time in the hotel room.
205,376,"Jul 21 2009 	Imperial Palace - No I mean Imperial DUMP!!	There can be no worse, ugly, dirty, old, disgusting hotel in the US. than the Imperial Palace in Vegas. If there is, I pitty the people staying there. This place is across the street from Caesar's- so it has a great location- but what a DUMP!This place needs to be blown-up and I mean soon!!Bad rooms, bad casino, bad food- it's HORRIBLE!!Do not stay here unless you are a bum or hobo!!"
206,376,"Jul 20 2009 	29 BUCKS A NIGHT--29 MILES IN THE HOTEL	For $29 in a fantastic location, no one should gripe. But, we did have to walk an amazing distance from the (free) self parking garage, through the casino to the front desk, then back through the casino to the elevators, then down a LONG hallway to our room. The room was clean and well-done, a typical hotel room, nothing fancy, but decent. The buffet was closed on the Monday we were there, so we went next door to Harrah's for a $16.95 buffet (get the coupon from the IP) which was fine. We were able to walk to the Treasure Island show and enjoy the sights on the strip because of our location. The Internet is $6 per hour. The pool closed at 6 p.m. (what was that about???---the concierge didn't even know). Our advice: get a room near the front of the hotel near the elevators. You will save some steps."
207,376,"Jul 20 2009 	I WILL NEVER STAY OR PLAY THERE AGAIN!!! NICKLED AND DIMED ME!!!	We went to vegas for my girlriend's 21st birthday. she wanted to stay at IMPERIAL PALACE (IP) because she stayed there before and thought it was a good affordable place to stay. well she was wrong, it was cheap. here is what I didn't like...1) room smelled like mildew, I think it was from the a/c but it went away after turning on the a/c brought in fresh air. so that was okay but not pleasant.2)the elevators take a very long time to pick anyone up. I would say about the longest we waited was at least 5-10 min every time. wasn't that busy of a weekend. sometimes when the elevators came quickly they were packed with people to the point that the overweight buzzer was always coming on.3)when I would talk to front desk or concierge, they were helpful but not nice or friendly. not a talkative group of people. now here is where I really got upset and annoyed...4) THE POOL CLOSES AT 5 PM EVERYDAY! who the hell closes their dinky little pool and spa area so early. when I called and asked about the pool, they said that it was closed at 5pm ( this was around 6 ), and when I asked if there was a reason why ( thinking maybe there was some kind of show or party or luau or something), the lady said no. then I asked why and she said because thats how they do things at the IMPERIAL PALACE. very upsetting when someone answers you like that.5) at just about 3 am the fire alarm starts sounding off. its very loud and annoying, thats a good thing when theres a freaking fire! but when there isn't a fire and everyone is getting woken up, they need some kind of control over the alarm. so I call the front desk and ask about whats going on and the guy said that its a false alarm and they are investigating, please disregard. so then I asked if its some kind of test or alarm checking and then he very rudely tells me to relax and its not their fault its going off, they didn't do it. I was very upset and very offended so I just called him an ---hole and then hung up. so the alarm continues to sound on and off for an hour, between 3-4 am. woke up late because of that, so I called the front desk and asked for a late check out til 1, they said only til 12 or they would charge me 29.95 for an hour. ------ ME OFF! AND I WAS VERY TIRED FROM THE WHOLE ALARM SOUINDING OFF FOR AN HOUR...6) I thought that when you are playing video poker games at the bar tops the drinks were free, well i guess not at the IP. had to pay for all of them while I was playing and spending money. mind you the drinks are small and weak and exspensive. HATED IT!6a) I had bought one of those big plastic cups from the stirp. so I decided that I would fill it up with my own alcohol and needed just a little bit more soda, so I asked the bartender for a just a little bit and he said that he can only give me a cup of soda for $3. are you kidding me, you can't spare soda without charging me up the --- ( NICKEL AND DIMING)... I'm not being a cheap guy, I just figure there is a small give when your taking all my money at a high rate. heres the most upsetting and most important fact...7) when checking out I told the check out clerk about my stay and she said, &quot;that'll be $200 please.&quot; she didn't apologize, discount or say anything. just acted like she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it.so needless to say I'm very upset and even more disappointed with the IP's costumer service. but I will say that the game floor and shows were good and very fun. I liked that part. from now on I'm staying at the FLAMINGO and BILLS. perfect location and reasonable prices and the costumer service is fun, friendly, flexible, negotiable and very talkative people and I'm very happy with them."
208,376,"Jul 19 2009 	great centre strip location!	We had purchased a 3 day Vegas/Grand Canyon package that included the IP as accomodation. I was a bit worried that it would be a crap hotel, but it was perfect for our sight-seeing. Right bang in the middle of the strip! Venturing out at all times of the day was so easy.Check in did have a long queue, they had at least 4 customer service reps opened, maybe they should look at opening more if they queue is growing? Our room was located on the twelth floor right at the back, this was the part I probably didn't like the most. Getting in and out of the hotel took soooo long, factoring in waiting for the elevator! I guess this is where 'budget' travellers are put. Apart from this, the hotel room was clean, serviced daily, a bit small but it's ok for sleeping, beds were comfortable, bathroom was old looking but everything still functioned well. We also ate once at the Teahouse restaurant inside the hotel because we were so hungry and tired (couldn't be bothered venturing out in the sweltering heat). Was quite expensive for 2 sandwich/fries meals + 2 soft drinks, so if you can, go outside to eat for better taste and value!Since there is so much choice in Vegas, I probably would not stay here again purely just to experience something else, but it was a great budget hotel room for unbeatable location."
209,376,"Jul 18 2009 	Great Location great value hotel.	We stayed here in June 2009 and had a brilliant time,the hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of the strip, the hotel is very clean and there is a great atmoshere here that you don't get as much in the other hotels. Would reccomend to anyone wanting to go to vegas on a budget as the price for the rooms are very cheap."
210,376,"Jul 18 2009 	Fantastic location great value...but not perfect	So here's the thing. I keep coming back to this hotel for two simple reasons: There is no hotel at a better location on the Las Vegas Strip. Imperial Palace is the dead-smack center of the Strip, and every single hotel and casino that's famous on the strip is an easy walk. You can be at any of these in 60 seconds: O'Sheas, Bill's, Caesar's, Harrah's, Casino Royale, Flamingo. You can be Venetian in 5 minutes. It's really just the most prime location in all of Vegas, and for that, I will forgive much. And the price is right. If you're a member of the Harrah's Club, you can get rooms for practically nothing during the week--perfectly serviceable but not-very-fancy of course.Unfortunately, this hotel is really showing its age. Many of the fixtures throughout the hotel and casino are 30 years old, the elevators are on their last legs (it seems to me), and being such a good value, it is quite busy at check-in and check-out. Some of the fixtures in the room are really in bad need of replacement...the GFCI outlet in my bathroom was actually melted (and that looked like OLD damage, not new damage). Definitely, the upkeep and maintenance of this hotel is...how shall we say...not a priority for Harrah's.The restaurants in my opinion have gone from &quot;decent&quot; to &quot;horrifying&quot; in the past two years. The guys in my group (who were certainly not complainers...) were mortified. But that's no big deal--there are somewhere around one hundred restaurants within a 3 minute walk from IP.The casino is interesting. Lower limit games ($5 craps, e.g.) are available 24/7, and the poker room is decent. Both the craps and poker areas were well maintained, and staffed by very strong dealers. Unfortunately, there is an extremely loud and schlocky &quot;Dealertainers&quot; blackjack area, which has (generally) very poor celebrity impersonators (9 times out of 10, everyone in the casino asked &quot;and who is he supposed to be?&quot;) dealing cards, and every so often, they pause to do an absurd karaoke impersonation. It was actually horrifyingly declasse'. Fortunately, the dealertainers mostly deal blackjack, and there is only the occasional idiocy with the karaoke.The wireless internet, which will run you $10 per day, is actually superior. I got good solid up and down bandwidth of around 1 Mbps, and the configuration was professional and permitted all sorts of protocols to pass unimpeded. A business traveler looking to connect to a corporate VPN will have absolutely no problem.The pool area is well maintained and busy. Again, since the hotel is such a good value, it is generally packed with beer-drinking party people and/or younger people, and so the pool area has gigantic speakers set up with music blasting...it's kind of like a frat house. You can forget about taking a nap during the day if your room is adjacent to the pool.I like this hotel. There is no hotel with a better location in Vegas--this is the very best plot of land. The price is definitely right. It's not going to titillate anyone with more refined sensibilities, however, and it has its weak points in terms of eyesores and service annoyances (after a 5 hour flight, waiting 45 minutes to check in made me furious). But, I guess, you're here to gamble and do things, so the unbelievable value that the hotel represents more than offsets my complaints. I do recommend it."
211,376,"Jul 17 2009 	Value for money	Bargain price! I agree with others... waiting for lift is a pain.. apart from that cheap cheerful, great location, Bearing in mind that the only time you are in the room is when you are asleep why pay the high prices of some of the other hotels.. You can go in any of them anytime you wnat to eat drink or gamble.. I would much rather have the extra cash to spend.Our room was clean and thats all that I was interested in.. i too lopve the dealertainers.. Michael Jackson was on one table ( even though he had died) Or maybe he hasnt?????"
212,376,"Jul 17 2009	Outdated and Dingy by Great Location	Stayed at the Imperial Palace for a reunion this weekend. I will not stay there again. They should tear it down and start over, as it's in a GREAT location on the strip. The Imperial is NOT a 3 star hotel as advertised various sites online. More like 1 1/2 Star.. We stayed in a 'renovated' room. I did not feel safe in the hotel. The hotel lobby, casino and rooms are outdated and a bit dingy. Wallpaper on the floors were torn or dirty. Check in took over an hour, and we checked in early. Crabby front desk people. Elevators were broken, and it took 15 minutes or longer each time to use the elevators, as two of 6 were broken and probably will not be fixed. (They no longer sell the parts needed to fix the old elevators). Phew. Only thing going for the Imperial is it's location was fantastic and it has free parking."
213,376,"Jul 16 2009 	still as good !	we have just got back from a twelve night stay at the i.p this is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and i have to say there are no complaints check in was a breeze a bit of a queue but nothing major, we got a free nugrade to a deluxe room without even asking !! all i did ask for was a room over looking the pool, this was beacuse if you get a strip view you also get all the noise from the carnival court at harrahs til about 3 am !! so if you like youre sleep dont go for a strip view, we could still see the strip from our room we had a great view of caesers palace, the hotel staff are great the hotel food is good, the casino drinks service is good, the pool is only small but it has a great atmosphere there is a b.b.q and a d.j there are some inflatables dotted round the edge of the pool and the pool bar isnt that badly priced ! the only thing that isnt that great are the lifts !!! they are soooo slow ! and the ones to the deluxe rooms are even worse, but overall this hotel is a dated little gem, and when we go back to vegas we will be staying there again its right slap bang in the middle of the strip and its very reasonabley priced its not luxury but you get what you pay for and who goes to vegas to stay in their room all day !!"
214,376,"Jul 14 2009 	Great Price Great Location	We stayed at the IP May 08 and found this hotel to be excellent value. OK it may not have the pomp and ceremony of some of the other Hotels on the strip, but I would prefer the extra $$$ in the wallet for retail therapy/shows! We returned New Years Eve 08 and again no complaints. No lines at check in, rooms clean, maid service could not fault and found everybody to be pretty friendly. Exactly as it was in May. Yes the lifts can be slow at times, but why stress. There are more important things happening on this planet to stress about rather than a slow lift!! We have stayed previously at the NY NY and the Flamingo, and yes the rooms did have a higher spec but that is reflected in what you pay. I can't fault either of these two hotels, but for LOCATION and COST the IP for us cannot be beat. We return in September (register your rewards card on the net, we have paid $130 for 7 nights at the IP via our rewards card. It costs us more to go to Spain!). Believe me it can't be that bad, if it was we wouldn't put ourselves through an 11hr flight and a -8hrs time difference to go to a room that was not clean and comfortable."
215,376,"Jul 14 2009 	Good Value for the Deal	Myself and 4 others stayed at the Imperial Palace on Thursday, Friday, and Staurday night in June. We arrived on Thursday night at about 10:30, check in took about 20 minutes (which isn't knock against the hotel- it's Las Vegas, this happens everywhere), and we were upgraded to a nicer room since the bed arrangement we initially requested wasn't available. As other reviewers mentioned, the casino is definitely older, but stil clean, and the waitresses still bring drinks. The location on the strip is great, and we weren't upset at all with the price we paid for the room because we did get a great deal and we aren't the type to hang out in the room on vacation anyway. Minor annoyances: there is no coffee pot in the room. I am not human until I've had coffee, so this annoys me. I called room service once and ordered a pot ($14) which i ended up canceling since they told me it would be over 45 minutes. I walked down to the &quot;burger shack&quot; in the casino, where coffee was, again, ridiculously expensive and not good. That was the same burger shack where 5 of us had to pay over $60 for some late night burgers that weren't any good (again, this is Las Vegas). Finally, we found out that there is a Burger King in the casino 3 or 4 casinos down(I think it's the casino with the Irish name, I just can't remember the name of it right now). They didn't have raised prices, and there was never really a wait, either in the a.m. for coffee or at night for snacks! Just a helpful hint for those looking for ways to cut unnecessary expenses. So, overall, IP was just fine for what we paid- but goodness, give your guests a little coffeepot. That's not too much to ask for!"
216,376,"Jul 14 2009 	Average hotel with excellent location!!	I stayed in IP on Jun 15th to 17th with my girl friend. Personally I think this hotel locates at the best intersection on the strip. There are many affordable dining options nearby and a beautiful forum shops across the street.I stayed in the deluxe room with a small balcony. The balcony is nice with the view of the swimming pool, however the room is no better than average (but who will stay in a hotel room for a day in Vegas lol)Overall I would recommand this hotel due to its excellent location and affordable rates."
217,376,"Jul 13 2009 	We lucked out...but it's not the best for everyone!	Here's the deal, many people have complanied about the long check in times and the extreme elevators and long walks to their rooms. Basically they are right, BUT, and I mean BUT, there are reasons why this happens so often.After reading these reviews, I decided to see what would make my stay better. I got 5 free nights comp. So, I hoped for the best. I didn't even request a quite room, I just let them pick it. Here's how I got a the best stay.I check in before the 4pm time frame. Many people would have gotten there around 3pm thinking that's early. I made sure my flight landed around 12:45. I got the casino around 1:45. No line, no wait, Checking in only took me 5 mins or so, and we got the nicest Luv Tub room. Very spacious. As for the walk, yes, it is a walk, but.....since we checked in early, we only had to take one elevator to our room. As for the elevators, they are extrememly slow, but what's the hurry, your in vegas! Here is why they are slow... The current elevators are running on a old motherboard and software. It would require extensive upgrading to make them run smarter and faster. Harrah's corp, seems to want to put their money elsewhere at this time. The room was perfect. It was located on the 10th floor away from the pool area and concert near Harrahs. We were shocked when walking up to it, it had a Double Door entrance! The only one on that floor. It was a huge room and everything inside for the most part was clean, and no funny odor. The hot water didn't seem to get hot, but it did improve over the course of the 5 days. Overall, I don't think I would stay here again, since other casinos are now offering me free weeks, but if you're on a budget and don't mind the classic old casino, this is your place. I would however book the luv tub room or higher.... The classic capri and deluxe are not worth the money. If you really want to treat yourself, get the penthouse suite which I believe is on the 17th or 18th floor. It's HUGE."
218,376,"Jul 10 2009 	Not the same Imperial Palace i started with years ago	This was like my 6th time in 15 years or wutever. I'll start good, like the room was really nice, a Delux, 2 queens and a balcony, great price thru Expedia. The auto collection up on the 5th floor was, as always, kewl. Location is great.Now the not good. Parking was a horror. They changed where you could drive to the main elevator with 15 minute parking while you register. I ended up in the back 40 and took like forever to get to registration. The whole place is a maze of corridors and signs, different levels, unknowing employees and confusion in general. After registration I just used valet and left the car. The bath sink stopper was broke so water could not flow out. Front desk said it would be like 2 hrs. Three girls..one sink...you figure. I used a nail file (after breaking a nail) to pry it out of there so we could continue. Went to the Emperor Buffet at 2:30 PM to use our 5 buck off coupon. It closed at 2. Will open 8 AM. Whoever heard of a casino buffet closing at 2 PM? Decided to use coupons at the Rio, which there was a free shuttle IF you can find it. After 3 different employees sending us 3 different ways and 45 minutes of stupidity I got a taxi outside and 10 bucks later arrived at Rio. (Very good buffet AND they knew where to catch the shuttle back to Palace). Breakfast Emperor was pretty bad, waited for the omelets, dry and tasteless. We did not finish, rest of food sorta blah or wutever. Still like 9 bucks even with off coupon. About 1/2 of the employees I dealt with were not nice, thank goodness the other half made up for it. There was a $5.60 &quot;resort&quot; surcharge per room per day that I knew was to be collected at the check in desk, so we paid cash for that. Going thru Expedia the rooms were paid in advance on the plastic and no refunds. So imagine my surprise when I got home and see $80.00 pending on my card. I called..did the push 1, push 2 routine, Spanish/English, had to go thru front desk to the mgr. It's like $40.00 a day they hold from your card EVEN IF THE ROOMS ARE PAID. OMG, it took like 3 days before it got credited back to me and they still kept $5.60, so I called AGAIN and they claim it was the second day &quot;resort&quot; tax. Come on ppl, get real. Why would they only collect 1 day at check in when you're booked for two? Plus I remember the 11 and change we gave. This place used to be happy, easy going, friendly, made me feel at home and personal. At this point 1/2 the ppl there have no idea what the right hand is doing as well as the left. The in house buffet is not convenient and not overly appetizing. I feel like I've lost a friend. Goodbye Imperial Palace, it was fun."
219,376,"Jul 10 2009 	Disappointed	We've stayed at the Imp/Palace four times in the past but this time was a disaster.A great location but the hotel is now a dump. The place needs blowing up. Service was rubbish, on two days we didn't get the room cleaned and when we asked why was told that the staff finish at 4.30. The casino with the mime artists is a joke, and the surly barmen serving the drinks have each had a personality byepass. Bed linen is old and frayed and the rooms stink. The Emporers buffet used to be good but not any more.Much better food all round at the Mirage. Sadly we won't be going there again."
220,376,"Jul 10 2009 	Worth the Stay!!	We stayed for five nights and had the best time of our lives. This hotel needs some renovation, but the staff, casino and surroundings were not bad at all. You cannot beat the location in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard. Best place for the money!!!!"
221,376,"Jul 9 2009 	Dated but clean and good slot machines - you get what you pay for	When we arrived we were allocated a room on 5th floor overlooking the swimming pool. When we got tot the room the noise was loud approx 2pm and we were advised that this could contiune until 9pm on show nights. With this in mind we moved to a mini suite on the 16th floor with a balcony and views over the rear of the hotel and the mountains. Room a bit dated and cost $30 per night extra but well worth evrey penny. Massive round bath in bedroom as well as bath and really powerfull shower in bathroom.Room was cleaned very well every day and we heard no noise at all. All the Americans were complaining about waiting for the lifts but the most we waited was 5 minutes throughout the whole stay, usually no more than a minute or two.Access to car park from strip can be difficult when busy but we found we could both exit and enter around the rear of the hotel Staff were very friendly and we won quite a bit on the slot machines.Next time will stay at Monte Carlo but this was a late booking and although hotel is dated we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday."
222,376,"Jul 9 2009 	Some good some bad	My wife and I stayed over the 4th of July weekend in a Luv tub comped room. Thats why we chose the IP. We have stayed all over Vegas, this was my first time at IP. The first room we were given was not cleaned and still had some items in it belonging to other people. Called the desk, they sent a bellman up and he brought us keys to the new room.The second room was much nicer, it was larger and laid out better. Had a balcony. The elevators are the bad point of this property. We did figureout to use the back elevators and walk a little bit more, it beat standing around.The gaming was great. Good minimums, good dealers. THe dealertainers are better than you think. Billy Idol was cool and Christina A. was hot. It is a very short walk to the O'SHeas casino next door. THey have great gaming also and good music playing. You can also see the outside from you table.We only ate there in the Tearoom one time for breakfast. It was good, not great. We ate other places every night. Stay here on a budget, be prepared for elevator waiting at busy times. THe staff and delaers were very nice and check in was a breeze. They also comped our pool cabana when we left early. ."
223,376,Jul 8 2009 	IDEAL LOCATION	Stayed in this hotel for seven nights never found anything to complain about the whole time.Reception is busy all day just like every other hotel in vegas so you just have to be patient roughly about 30mins wait time to check in we found the staff cheerful and helpful at all times. We were put on the 5th floor not much of a view but very quite if thats what you want its worth asking for this floor.We had a maid in eve4ry day no complaints at all well worth her $20 tip. The hotel may not be one of the new ones but for the right price who can complain.The location is right bang in the middle of the strip where the other big and well know hotels are a short walk away.
224,376,"Jul 8 2009 	cheap and cheerful great location	just opposite the ceasar palace, in the middle of the strip.the room are clean and the staff friendly.the casino a bit old but you only need a bed to sleep.ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the one at the front could be really noisy."
225,376,Jul 7 2009 	Great Location Bad Service and Value	From the outside the place looked old. Check-in took 45min.The room was a decent size. Great view of the pool. Room service was prompt. Convience to every where you want to go was Great cause of the location (hotel was right in the middle of the strip). not bad for $$$.
226,376,"Jul 7 2009 	I have stayed here 6 Times!! Don't listen to the reviews	If your coming to Vegas to stay in luxury then stay at the Wynn! This hotel is one of my fav's as I'm a canadian who has been to Vegas 15 times!! Yes the hotel is dated , but if you want to stay where ALL the action is then stay here, it's central to everything you need, It's located in the middle of the strip and you can via footwalk to anywhere you like, If your an all night gamer this is the safest relaxed place to be at 3am. Highly reccomended &lt;3"
227,376,"Jul 6 2009 	Centre Strip good location 	A really good hotel, clean with friendly staff. Only draw back is the queue for the lifts. Other than that, large rooms, most with 2 double beds. Food is good in the Embers Restaurant. Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner in the main restaurant is good value for money!!Casino is fair size. A bit darker than some, but plenty to choose from. Good pool and outside bar. And, walking distance to Carnaval Court with live music most of the day (and night). If you like to keep fit, a small gym with a beauty room is also available. Biggest sports book on the strip alsoHave stayed there 3 times and plan on staying there again at least twice in 2010."
228,376,"Jul 6 2009 	Perfect Hotel if all you need is a base while enjoying Vegas!!!	I have just returned from a 4 night stay in the IP, and have no problem with the hotel at all. Let's face it, you are not going to Vegas for the hotel facilities, you are going for the casinos, nightlife etc.The hotel is dead in the middle of the strip, i had no problems checking in, ok, you could wait a few minutes for an elevator, but so what.... the hotel is huge.The casino is big, some cheap table limits, which is a nice start to your gambling antics, and the staff were friendly and helpful at all times.I personally think, that if you look after them, they will look after you, i left a $10 tip first day to the maid, room was spotless every day afterwards, maybe most of the Americans i bumped into need to learn a few basic manners!!The only thing i would say, is that if i was going back with the wife, i would probably spend the few extra quid to stay in the luxury at Ceasers, but hey, that's a different kind of holiday......"
229,376,"Jul 5 2009 	You could not pay me to stay at that place again.	What a fool I used to be! Now I am older and wiser. A two hour wait to check in was our welcome after working our way past the meaningless directional signs. It was like some cruel hoax, those signs were so wrong. The next morning we gave up waiting for an elevator and decided to take the stairs, not knowing there was no way out of the stairway without opening an alarmed door (lying signs again), even on the ground floor. Luckily, we ran into about 20 other guests in the stairway who had also given up on the elevators, so the doors to other floors were opening from the hallways pretty often and we had no problem returning to the elevators.....to wait and then only have them be totally full when they arrived. It was almost 20 min. from the time we left our room (right next to an elevator) until we got downstairs. I would always rather take the stairs, but this hotel doesn't allow that. Same thing going up later that day...... a line all the way into the casino of guests waiting to get onto an elevator. What a miserable joke this hotel is. I can't believe it wasn't intentional. No mgt. can be that incompetent by accident. Monkeys can do a better job. Next time I go to Vegas, I will be sure to drop some garbage off at the Imperial Palace."
230,376,"Jul 3 2009 	Excellent value for money cheap as chips!	You cannot get a better location for a hotel on the strip. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who isn't posh or stuck up as it's very down to earth but the emphasis is on fun not luxory. The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable and cost buttons. When we checked in they gave us a room with a pool view as we were 1st timers and a book of vouchers which was a very nice touch. I think all the rooms come with a balcony which is rare for vegas and a big plus point.The pool was nothing fancy but nice and you can go to any hotel pool in the Harrah's chain, 7 in total, Flamingo, Harrah's Paris, Ballys, Caesar's Palace and Rio. We took the free shuttle bus to Rio from Harrah's and spent a day at their very lush pool!The casino has a great atmosphere and there is a real buzz as you walk through. The dealertainers are great fun and I would recomend playing at their tables on the way back from a night out when your well into the Vegas Spirit!"
231,376,"Jul 3 2009 	VALUE	Stayed here before, cheap clean perfect mid strip location. More money for fun elsewhere!"
232,376,"Jul 1 2009 	A dirty grubby tired and dated hotel.	Do not stay at this hotel. You will be bitterly dissapointed. After spending hours travelling to Las Vegas, on an eagerly awaited holiday, we arrived at the airport and got ripped off by a taxi driver who took the &quot;scenic route&quot; to our hotel. On arrival and check in I was spoken to by a very abrupt member of staff at the registration desk. No one at this hotel ever showed us any courtesy and I found them to be very ignorant. When we entered the hotel room I could not believe the condition of it . The carpets were filthy the beds even had sweets under them from previous occupants. There was thick dust at the back and tops of units and the floor in the bathroom was dirty. The corridors are filthy and evry where smells of smoke and stale alcohol, Stay somewhere else!!!!!"
233,376,"Jun 30 2009 	location location location	best value ,clean , and in the middle of the strip previously stayed at ti across the street that was more modern and nicer but more than twice the price. going back in november and have already booked ip. less than two hundred dollars for five nights."
234,376,"Jun 29 2009 	Another Great Stay!	We stayed 5 nights in a luv tub room and loved it! I had requested a smoking room when I made the reservation but when we arrived to check in on Sunday night I was told there weren't any available for that night but we could change our room the next day which is what we did, Our first room was on the 9th floor and had no view at all except of the parking garage, our second room was on the 18th floor and had a great view of the pool. We have stayed here many times and will definately be returning."
235,376,"Jun 28 2009	Basic and Noisy	Old fashioned hotel locaterd in the middle of the strip, rooms that face the swimming pool are very noisy due to disco bar until about 3am. Rooms are very basic, queues for the lifts are common. No tea/coffee faclities. Good clean linen and towels, good maid service, pleasant staff. Lifts are a good walk through the casino from the front desk."
236,376,"Jun 26 2009 	Never Stay Again	I would never stay here again. We booked online, but the prices don't tell you that you are in the bowels of the hotel, far in the back looking at the end of the garage.The room was never made up, no towels to replace the used ones, no soaps, shampoos or anything.. left over dirty finger nails left on counter when we arrived. Very difficult to find your way around that place and staff is not very friendly..it's not expensive but would rather stay at the Venetian than in the pits. I actually like the old strip better and the rooms are easy to access...nope wouldn't recommend this place to anything....oh yest, if you weigh over 190 lbs, you won't fit in the bathroom."
237,376,"Jun 24 2009 	PLEASE READ MY REVIEW I JUST GOT BACK!!!!	I just got back from Vegas and stayed 3 nights of my 2 week stay at the IP. Before I left, I read the reviews and was horrified. All of those reviews were so wrong. The only thing that was difficult was the elevators because the place is HUGE! Otherwise I have to tell you that all the staff in the whole place is awesome, and cannot do enough for you. I want to make special mention to TIM the bell man, who gave us extra treatment with lots of help, navigating the hotel. Room service that we got all 3 mornings was elegant, hot and delicious!! I kept trying to figure out what everyone was trying to say but there really was no negative. The room was clean, very clean, and there were plenty of towels and when we needed extra blankets and in no time at all housekeeping came with a smile. The place is great and it hurts me when people so casually say negative things about a place like this. Think about who the IP is owned by... This is a beautiful well run place and all I can say is go and see for your self.. VERY CLEAN..."
238,376,"Jun 23 2009 	Rennovate it!!!!!	This hotel is in serious need of a rennovation or tear down. Our &quot;deluxe&quot; room had stains on the carpet, cigarette burns on the bedding, carpet and counter tops, and the box spring on the bed looked like it was picked up off the street. The bath tub and sink areas were chipped and stained. There was hair on the bathroom floor from previous travelers. I was glad I brought my can of Lysol!!! The balconys are standing room only. The elevators are extremely slow and the experience to get from the front lobby to the parking area and then to our room was really frustrating. On the flip side, the casino, gift shop areas and corridors were nice and appeared to be clean."
239,376,"Jun 18 2009 	Good value for money	You get what you pay for, there can be queues for elevators at times, room service not alaways in order, overall its a cheap feeling to it compare to other big hotels. BUT, here's the best part, for $30 a night, you get the best spot on the strip, its bang right in the middle. Everything within walking distance. We asked for a top floor room with strip view, we got the room right at the top with balcony and amazing views of strip and mountains. You can see the sunset over the mountains and lights at night just gorgeous. You can also see bellagio fountains in far corner from balcony. BUT again, staying in these rooms comes with a noisy price, just below this tower, theres Harras out door party tent which plays loud music from afternoon till 4am in morning. During night time it is very noisy and total nuisanse, we thought of changing it after first night, BUT here's the trick again, if you leave the AC fan on, it does reduce the noise considerably. And so we stayed whole 10 nights in this way. But there are other towers you can choose to stay if you are not fussy about the views. Its perfact for budget travellers for its location, you cant beat it, but if you have few extra dosh then go elsewhere like caesars palace right opposite."
240,376,"Jun 17 2009 	You get what you pay for	Ok we just got back last week and had a good time in Vegas. The room was comped so why should I complain. The room looked very grimey but I can say the cleaning people came everyday to change towels. The furnishing &amp; decor is very outdated. THE FOOD! UGG..The buffet was very bland. My husband threw his breafast away. BLAND! I understand they can't over season but GOD! I hated that the pool closes @ 5:00pm, we never got a chance to take a dip. The hotel staff is very pleasant. I want book here again."
241,376,"Jun 17 2009 	Dirty Old Hotel	The room we were given had no tub and the water would spill out on the tile, the room had an odor like moldy carpet. We changed room which was an improvement, the hall carpeting was stained. The only good thing was it was centrally located around the other 5 star hotels. The parking was convenient, however the hotel still has a hold on my credit card after I've already checked out! I wouldn't recommend staying here, unless you stay drunk and don't give a damn!"
242,376,"Jun 16 2009 	For a few bucks more...stay somewhere else!	We drove from California to Las Vegas and decided to stay at the IP. When we drove up to have Valet park our car - they yelled at us to move the vehicle and we hadn't gotten our luggage out of the car yet! They finally had us park down around the corner (by the entry to the parking lot) and told us they would take care of our car. 30 minutes later - it was still sitting there. Don't stay above the fifth floor - you'll wait forever for an elevator (and at least you can walk from the fifth floor). We were on the 16th floor - it was SO noisy! and you ALWAYS wait at least 10 minutes for an elevator. All we wanted to do was to go work out - found out there is a $10 charge/person/day to use the gym! (and it wasn't that nice). Complained to the manager and left three messages for him to contact us - we never got a call. Guess they don't believe in good customer service at the IP. You have to walk through a wall of smoke to get to the elevators - the place stinks cigarettes and cigars! The only kudos I will give this place is the Housekeeping Department - whenever we called them for something they were always pleasant and johnny on the spot! The front desk definitely needs a few lessons on smiling and giving great customer service. My next trip, I will pay the additional $$$ to stay at a nicer and cleaner place. This may be centrally located, but with the monorail - almost all the hotels are close to it. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere."
243,376,"Jun 16 2009 	Fabulous location...best value hotel on the strip	Having stayed at the Imperial Palace in 2005, when my sister, some friends and I went back to Vegas in September 2008, I knew what to expect from this hotel and it easily met my expectations. This is the only place where you will get true value for money and personally I'd rather save the extra $$$ for shopping and gambling!We booked via Expedia for 10 nights in Deluxe rooms - obviously a Deluxe room at the Imperial is probably on the same level as a Standard room in other strip hotels but let's face it, you don;t go to Vegas to sit in your room and admire the wallpaper! Well, we didn't anyway!Upon arrival, there was a fairly long queue at check-in but this is to be expected anywhere in Vegas, especially as we arrived at the hotel not long after the official check-in time of 3pm. The queue moved pretty quickly and we were seen by a very pleasant woman who advised us that there were no Non-Smoking rooms available but there would be some the next day. Therefore we stayed in Smoking rooms for one night which wasn't a problem as they were clean and didn't smell or anything. The next day we just had to call down to reception and they gave us Non-Smoking rooms with no problems.When we stayed in this hotel in 2005, we were in Standard rooms and in my opinion the Deluxe rooms aren't much different except for the decor being a bit nicer. All their rooms seem to be spacious and clean and I love the fact that they have balconies. I don't think there are many hotels on the strip that offer private balconies! We had a view of the pool and our friends were on the opposite side of the corridor and had a view of the mountains and horizon, both views were great. The rooms had air conditioning units which worked fine and standard CRT TV's which had a decent number of channels. The bathrooms were nice and clean with a bath/shower combo and a nice sized sink/vanity area. Lots of towels and flannels which were changed regularly.We loved our housekeeping lady, Linda, she was so funny! We had a good laugh with her when we saw her and she was so friendly. We always left her a few dollars each morning which I first read about doing on here and is definately worthwhile.The casino area of the hotel is by far one of the most fun and relaxed environments out of all the strip hotels. Yeah it's a bit smoky but thats one of the things you have to accept if you're going to be hanging around Vegas casinos! We only ate in the hotel once as there were so many other places we wanted to go to - we stopped in the Teahouse place late one night after we'd been out and I had a delicious BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and fries...great value for money and just what I needed after a few beers!We also stopped off in Betty's Diner quite a few times to grab coffee and snacks and I really recommend you try this place if you get a chance. The coffee isn't great (there's a Starbucks next door in Harrahs) but all the snacks are freshly made and delicious! The peanut butter cookies, chocolate croissants and pastries in particular! Mmmmm!Overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower, etc - you can't get a better location for this price. If you have higher expectations of a hotel room though, you could be disappointed if you stayed here.Personally, I've already booked to go back to Vegas and guess what, I'll be staying at the Imperial Palace again! I love it there."
244,376,"Jun 15 2009 	Awsome Value Great Location!	Unlike all the negative reviews on this hotel i have a positive one! This hotel was great for value. If you expect a 5 star hotel, book at a 5 star hotel for an extra 100$ - The rooms were clean and just roomy enough - we got a balcony which overlooked the pool - the only downside to thatt was the music was blaring at 9 a.m. (great if your an early riser, but not so great hungover). The room service was excellent, this is where we ate most of our meals, food was excellent. The beds were confortable and the bathroom was and quite roomy. The casino downstairs was really nice, not huge - but they had &quot;dealertainers&quot; where they dressed as celebrity's and pretended to sing their songs - they were a hoot (you can also play poker, etc. with them dealing to you. The Location, again, was awsome - you walk out and your right in the middle of the strip - not a long walk to anything really. If you wanted to get to the other end of the strip - there is a double decker bus called &quot;the deuce&quot; its 7 dollars for 24 hours pass and it brings you to both outlet malls and freemont street (with random stops all the way up the strip) - i suggest this bus other than the city buses or trains - (those were sketchy). We went to one show - the Improv at Harrah's - was the cheapest one and we had a blast! the comedians were hilarious (but make sure you go to the 8:30 show - we went to the 10:30 show and it wasnt even full which made it less fun. the 8:30 show was packed. We went to all the attractions - The Secret Garden(The Mirage) - Eifell Tower - Stratosphere - Freemont Street - and the little shows outside each hotel that go on at night. They were all great! I would definitly reccomend this hotel if your planning on getting out and seeing the world! If your on a vacation to sit in your hotel room - go somewhere else."
245,376,Jun 14 2009 	Great Location 	We booked a 4 nite stay through Allegiant Air as a package deal. Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous. When we arrived we got our choice of room location and the horror stories of the rooms in the back were unfounded. Our room was neat and clean and not noisy. No fumes from the garage area.The buffet wasn't elaborate like some hotels but the food was good.As with everything in Vegas you do have a lot of walking in ALL the hotels to get to your room . This hotel could use some updating but the location was great. Other major casinos were a short walk away or you could catch the tram behind the hotel.We will stay at this hotel again!!!!
246,376,Jun 14 2009 	Great place to stay	We arrived and was told there were no more double bed non smoking. We were then upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The room service was excellent. This is a gem it is located in the middle of the strip. I will use this hotel and casino again.
247,376,"Jun 10 2009 	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place!	After reading some bad reviews here, I was apprehensive about staying at the IP, but I got such an incredible rate I just couldn't justify staying anywhere else. This was my first trip to Vegas and I was pleasantly suprised when our airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel.Check in was very fast - only had to wait a few minutes in line. The front desk staff were exceptional - friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The concierge (2 different gentlemen, on 2 different days) were equally helpful. Checkout was even faster.I don't understand the reviews with comments about the hotel being difficult to find your way around in! We stayed in a deluxe room on the 13th floor, and the front desk clerk gave us a small map of the lobby which showed us exactly how to find the elevators to our room. Yes, it was a long walk, but all of the hotels parade you through their casinos en route to your room so the IP is no exception. And the elevators were very fast and all operable during our stay. I can honestly say we never waited more than a minute for an elevator.We ordered room service one night, and received our food in about 15 minutes. The gentleman who delivered our food was extremely courteous and professional. Housekeeping staff was also outstanding during our stay. (I'm a firm believer in leaving a tip every day and it's amazing what a smile and a dollar can do!) Our room was comfortable, the beds and pillows were great, the a/c worked fine as did everything else in our room. The room was very clean and well maintained. The balcony was small but served its purpose. Our room facing the pool was nice and quiet in the evenings. During the day the music from the pool was pretty loud, but we weren't there to sit in our room!The pool area is pretty plain compared with other hotels in the area, but it had a fun atmosphere and no shortage of sun. The poolside bar and food concession was convenient and they had a great drink special the day we were at the pool (Tuesday) - 2 Bud in a bucket of ice for $5.50 all day. It's hard to argue with a deal like that! They have a luau at the pool on select days of the week, which we did not bother with, although it did seem like a good enough deal. For $59 per person you got the meal, entertainment and unlimited drinks. (On the days that the pool is closed to the public because of the luau you are encouraged to use the pool at the neighbouring Flamingo or Harrah's - all owned by the same group. So we checked out the pool at the Flamingo one day as well!)To be honest, the IP reminds me of a typical Holiday Inn or Howard Johnson's Hotel (with a casino in the lobby, lol). There is nothing wrong with this place. If you are coming here and expecting the luxuries of The Venetian or The Wynn.... you really don't have realistic expectations. This is a basic comfortable hotel and it serves its purpose well. I would not hesitate to stay here again, and the location in the middle of the Strip and the wonderful staff we encountered at every turn are the IP's best assets, IMO."
248,376,"Jun 8 2009 	OK but the layout is confusing.	We had lots of trouble navigating. There were different elevators, for different floors. Too much walking for elderly. We had to go up an escalator, then down another to get to the parking deck.. Very confusing. Elevators were not large enough."
249,376,"Jun 8 2009 	Great price great location!	We stayed a the Imperial Palace for 5 nights earlier this year as part of a round the world trip. After travelling for over 5 months, price was the most important thing to us and I think we stumbled upon a little gem. We stayed in the cheapest rooms which are located outside and to the back of the hotel (they are still joined on though).The location is PERFECT for seeing Vegas, it's right in the centre of the strip and within walking distance of all the other large hotels, casinos, shops, restaurants etc. We ate at the all you can eat in the hotel once and had no complaints, it wasn't as good as some of the others we tried but was also better than others. The rooms were basic but great; large, TV, en suite with shower and bath. Our room was spotless and cleaned daily. We had no complaints at all.I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend who was visiting Vegas."
250,376,"Jun 6 2009 	Excellent Location for the price	This hotel is tucked away in the middle of The Strip where all the action is! It is right opposite Caesar's Palace and Mirage.I had booked a room for the 2 of us through a Vegas tourism site, and even though we went during the slack season, i believe it was a steal to pay the kind of price i did, and stayed in such a location.Since its bang in the centre of the strip and walking distance from the biggest and best hotels.It is also connected with a kind of tram system with a stop within the hotel.The rooms and bathrooms are clean and alright enough to spend jst a few hours to catch up on the sleep before you head out for partying/gambling/sightseeing.It also hosts a music extravaganza in the evenings with the singers(duplicates) like bette midler, elvis etc belting out numbers in the hotel theatre before doing some songs on the casino floor.The dinner buffet was ok, and the swimming pool alright.Must stay here if you plan a budget trip and would rather spend on shows and eating and partying than on the room itself.Look out for good deals on the net before making a definate booking."
251,376,"Jun 5 2009 	The IP is Centrally Located and Established	This hotel needed to be imploded when the others were, but that time has passed and this place is older and showing it's age. The location cannot be beat, sandwiched between The Flamingo and Harrah's you will not be bored. The check in was flawless and the desk staff were courteous. Finding the room on the other hand was horrendous, it took us about 30 minutes because of the eclectic design of this building, the elevators were slow and many were out of service and with this hotel being so busy, it was to be expected.There was no Starbucks or Seattle's Best but Betty's diner sufficed for the am coffee fix.There is no midnight cafe for pancakes and eggs but there is a hamburger joint (we didn't eat there).The room was relatively clean although dusty under the bed and the bathroom was clean but old(wallpaper peeling).The cleaning ladies are the best and they do a very good job.(Hey People a couple of bucks for a daily tip does wonders sometimes)I did order room service and it did come promptly and courteously.(It was expensive but it's a vacation)The entrance into the hotel by car is a nightmare, dodging the people crossing your path is an art form, if you wait, they will never let get by for entry. A word of advice is to valet , to self park is to self punish, you will see.The gaming staff were OK, but that's hard to grade when all one is doing is playing machines. The cocktail waitresses were ok as well and yes we tipped them well.The dealer-tainers were entertaining and fun to watch.No, I will not be staying there again"
252,376,"Jun 4 2009 	HONEST opinion of Imperial Palace	Firstly, I was very apprehensive after booking this Hotel because of all the bad reviews it has been given. Now that my husband and I have stayed there, I am giving a totally honest opinion from our 8 night stay.Checking In - Checking Out - There was a bit of a queue, which took approx 10 mins to get through, but hey, this is Vegas, and the influx of people coming and going is phenomenal. We found both checking in and out no problem and were given a choice of a king size bed or two queen beds in the Deluxe Rooms. Room - We chose the 2 bedded room on a smoking floor. Our room was on 18th floor - top of the hotel (1887). The beds were actually two double beds, and the room was fine. The beds were very comfortable (and I am fussy with my bed). Bathroom was fine with bath and shower. Shower was spot on. Small balcony in the room which was ideal for me smoking as my husband is a non-smoker. By the way, being on a smoking floor did not really affect him and he actually said, it wasnt bad at all i.e smell etc. The only problem I found all week, is that the cleaners are not that great. My ashtray remained on the balcony and was never emptied, nor was the balcony swept at all. The room was fine overall and you get what you pay for after all, so all these people moaning and complaining, I would say, spend more and stay at The Mirage, Bellagio or MGM. We actually did spend my birthday night in a penthouse suite at The Mirage (suprise from my husband) and it was absolutely fantastic - like staying in a Palace, but the price matches what you get !Casino - My husband said he preferred Imperial Palace Casino as he said it was lively compared to the other casino's which he found a bit boring with not much atmosphere. IP Casino, with Dealertainers did liven things up, and we did have a few laughs with people around the bar area's. All other Casino's we went in, everyone seemed to keep themselves to themselves and seemed to frightened to &quot;mix&quot;.Food - We only ate breakfast once at the hotel, so cannot comment, other than the breakfast was &quot;a breakfast&quot; and was fine. Some good places to eat would be Magaritaville (to left of hotel) - LOVELY. My favourite was Tony Roma's which is in Binnions Casino in Fremont Street. Absolutely fantastic and reasonable. Ribs and Steaks to kill for (and have half an Onion Loaf with your main course MMMmmmm). We also found the Buffet at Harrah's very good and ate there a few times. Loads to choose from and all very good. We came out of there absolutely stuffed. So many good choices of dishes, we just had to try them all ! ! ! Drinks in Binnions Casino are also very cheap - we had Vodka and coke and JD and coke for $3.50. Couldnt belive it ! You can also have you photo taken for free (and put in a nice folder) with $1,000,000. Great souvenier.TIPS - I would advise casual clothes and very, very comfy shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking. Best way to get around, we found, is the deuce bus, which runs 24 hours from one end of strip to the other. 24 hr pass is $7, Well worth it. Just pay as you get on the double decker bus. They run about every 5 - 7 mins.Swimming Pool AreaSituated on 2nd Floor and we thought one of the best pools we had ever been too for atmosphere and fun. The pool is small and not a patch on the pools in most of the other hotels - but what fun we had. DJ around the pool playing great music from 60's, 70's and 80's and many a time people would be up singing and dancing - great fun. Burgers around the pool very good too.Elevators - SLOW ???? We were there 8 nights and never, and I am saying NEVER had to wait longer than 2 mins for an elevator. Lucky? Who knows, but no problem experienced from us at all.Anyway, enjoy your stay in Vegas - we did."
253,376,"Jun 1 2009 	Location michigan	The location on the strip is perfect. Walking distance to many attrations and casinos.Yes the elevators were slow but they were working! Granted this is not a high end hotel but for the price I can not see a better value on the strip! Rooms were clean, service was good and the casino had a good variety of machine to play. Take your waling shoes and enjoy!"
254,376,"May 31 2009 	Eat elsewhere.	This may be a little old, but I understand things have not improved! My wife and I flew to Vegas intending to stay a few nights there and then drive to Death Valley, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite and San Francisco. The second day there we had sea bass for dinner that was heavily spiced. We were both ill, but my wife suffered very badly, the effects lasting about a week. Our flight over the Grand Canyon was completely spoiled, as was the drive to Death Valley. The service at the hotel was almost non-existent and there was no help in finding one's way around it. The room was fairly clean, but not what we would hope for. Like most of Las Vegas, the exterior was showy, but the casino and interior were tatty and had no atmosphere."
255,376,"May 30 2009 	would still stay again if price right	Have stayed at a number of hotels in vegas over my years of visiting, and a number of times at this hotel. Chosen because very cheap price and central in strip so easy to get to all attractions.Rooms are very clean with 2 big comfortable beds TV and table and chairs.The parking however is a long walk and the elevators took a long time to come, we were on 6 floor. The pool area was very noisy."
256,376,"May 30 2009 	Grimy Rooms in perfect location	Cons: We came for the World Series of Poker tournament and this hotel was one advertising special rates for players. The front desk staff, although courteous, were not aware of the special discount and we spent around 45 minutes, on top of waiting in line for 30 minutes, to get it all sorted out and into our rooms. We had booked a non-smoking &quot;deluxe&quot; room with a King bed. While we were aware that this was a budget hotel, if what we got was &quot;deluxe&quot; then i wonder what passes for &quot;standard&quot;. The carpet was mildewy, stained and the entire room reeked of old cigarettes and body odour. Neither the tub nor the sink drained properly at all - the most disgusting aspect of our stay. The bed was actually 2 bouncy twins wrapped/held together by a thin king fitted sheet. Bedding was of course the cheapest, scratchiest type. The elevators were often out of service. No mini-fridge in the room. We had a very old tube TV in the room.Room service was incredibly expensive - with breakfast sides starting at $10and going up to $15 for eggs.Pros:Wifi was available and working at a cost. AC worked fine.TV actually had 4 working channels. Dry cleaners offered alteration services.Very convenient access to monorail and free shuttle service on the strip.Thank god it's situated within walking distance to the Venetian.The lobby floor is noisy, smoky and cramped. The overall feel of the resort is outdated, faded, crowded and disconcerting. Would NEVER stay here again."
257,376,"May 30 2009 	Aweful Place to stay.	The Imperial Palace is definately a hotel I would not stay again.The carpet in the rooms were stained with whatever.Bathtub was dirty, Very old and out dated TV, Smoke alarms were rusty, and the general appearance of this hotel is terrible. Elevators are old, dirty and chipped railing.Pool lounge chairs are old, mildewed, and disgusting to lay down on. Water in the pool was not heated and there was very little security as to who can use the pool.I would not eat at this hotel after seeing the decline in appearance and unsanitary conditions. It's a dump."
258,376,"May 29 2009 	Perfect Location!	I cannot fault this hotel! it may not look as amazing as the Bellagio or the Venetian, but it is centre of the Strip and very easy to get to all the main attractions!We stayed for 6 nights for my partner's 30th, and we had a choice between saving 300-400 each staying at the Imperial, or staying in a better hotel like MGM or Venetian. So we decided that we wouldn't be in our hotel that much anyway and should just spend that money on shopping and roulette instead! The rooms were spacious and clean, even had a mini balcony for some fresh air, and the pool area had loads of sunbeds.Would definitely visit again as such great value for money. I also recommend the bar in front of Imperial called Rockhouse for daytime beer pong and frozen margaritas!"
259,376,May 27 2009 	Very dirty and not very helpful staff	We stayed at the Capri rooms-after asking several personnel (who just said down the hall) we found the room after about 30 minutes. Very sad the directions to get to the room and walked a long way to get to the casino or anywhere within the main section of the hotel. The rooms are very run down and felt dirty and not very clean. One of the worse hotels I have stayed at. If you are into the retro decor-looks like it's been neglected a long time-you can get beyond the stained carpet and dirty bathrooms. Drains didn't work well. I talked with others in the capri rooms who felt the same way. The price is not worth the value-
260,376,"May 27 2009 	Cheap and Good	If you want a clean hotel room on the cheap (we paid $35 a night), located right smack in the middle of the strip, with casino, food and shopping all in one place, this is it. They even have a free shuttle from/to the airport. Expect no luxury, this is strictly a functional stay. You get a clean bed (trust me, I even took apart the bed looking for bedbugs, found none but did find a new matress and clean linens). If you want more luxury, go to the Montecarlo accross the street. Check in was fast, we arrived early so the bell boys securely stored our bags away until check in time. The Dealertainers will remind you were you are on a nightly basis. The casino is adequate, but kinda crammed. Great and cheap base of operations for your sojourn to Vegas. Tip: for a $2 tip on your pillow, you get great room service."
261,376,"May 27 2009 	Loved this hotel	First,of all after reading the reviews I was skeptical. However, they were all wrong. 1. Check-in line was long. However it was Memorial day weekend Fri nite. they had all 6 stations going. The lined moved very fast. I got to choose my floor, and loud or quiet. When I got to my room I was very very happy. I booked the deluxe tub room. It was clean, and very very quiet. The hotel is very big (as all hotels on the strip are). Our room was clean and we never had any issues. Every room has a balcony that overlooks the hotel pool and a great view of Ceasars.I would truly stay here again. If you are looking for cheap accomodation then you will get a room outside by the parking lot, which is NOT inside the main hote. However, if you can, get a regular room and you will be happy. The elevators move kind of slow, but again, if lots of people are staying there, its to be expected. The pool was fabulous. They had a live dj that Sat, the beer specials are awesome. Overall, I would definetly stay there again. We had no issues."
262,376,"May 26 2009 	Better Than We Thought It would Be....	My husband and I just got back a few days ago from a 7 day, 6 night trip out to Vegas. We are not &quot;big&quot; spenders when it comes to gaming; however when we entered in our Total Rewards card # back in January, we were shocked to find that the Imperial Palace was going to comp us every night of our stay except for Friday night (a steal at $49!) We didn't hesitate to book the trip, though we have to admit we were pretty worried about what this &quot;Free&quot; room would be like. Previous reviews have given horror stories about room conditions, so we were more than prepared to slip a $20 to the front desk clerk if they were going to put us up in a Capri room, to try and upgrade. Turns out, we could not have been any happier with the room they gave us! 15th floor, simple but clean, with a fantastic view of the strip and looking right down over Harrah's Carnaval Court (which if you are not a heavy sleeper or like to go to bed before 1am is not helpful with getting a good night's sleep!) The water pressure in the shower was unlike any other I have ever experienced-nice and strong, and never wanted to leave the shower once I got in! Staff was very friendly, pool facilities were adequate but not flashy (and it is a bit difficult to find the first time around, consider yourself warned!) We had breakfast at the Teahouse and also at Betty's, both places did the job, but again nothing too extravagant. I would like to mention as an extra bonus to check out the poolside luau and show on Tuesday and Saturday nights-get reduced price tix from inside O'Shea's and you can save $15-$20 per person off the VIP package. We really enjoyed the show and dinner. Of course you CANNOT beat the location of this hotel! The only negative I would have to state that really ate up time, especially the morning we were checking out, was how incredibly slow the elevators were. Twice it took us over 10 minutes (no joke!) to get an elevator that wasn't packed to capacity. All in all, we would not hesitate to recommend the IP to anyone looking for a clean, friendly place to lay their weary heads and bodies down after a long day of gambling and walking. Better than we thought it would be!"
263,376,May 26 2009 	great value	great value for the price. the elevators a little slow but they were doing the best they could do to fix it. would stay agian
264,376,"May 26 2009 	Very bad customer service and Watch out for your incidental charges	Very stern receptionist who wouldn't listen to our questions, just kept saying &quot;Next in line&quot;.I paid for supposedly a &quot;DELUXE-plus&quot; Suite but TV was broken we were switched to another room which had electrical problems.After my trip when I reviewed my credit card, they graciously charged an extra $80 charge, which they admitted was a mistake, but would take at least five business days to refund.... WATCH OUT!!!"
265,376,"May 26 2009 	Better then Expected!	After reading all of the negative reviews, I had very low expectations for this hotel and wasn't really looking forward to staying there. I was however pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this hotel. Our room was spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable. We loved the patio overlooking the pool area. We really enjoyed the entertainment in the casino with the dealers that impersonate stars like Alice Cooper, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder...it was really fun to watch and created a lively atmosphere in the casino area. The location of the hotel is perfect and we were within walking distance of all the best hotels and hot spots. We loved the pool area which was great for lying out with a drink. Overall we had a great time and all of the staff members we came in contact with were helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again. Especially because it's a great deal! The only one negative comment I have is that the buffet was horrible! Even with it being so cheap I would never eat there again unless I was really desperate. Most of the food tasted funny and was cold."
266,376,"May 26 2009 	Enjoyed my second stay here	Stayed here before in 2005 so knew what to expect and it had not changed much. Still offers very good rates for a great location (centre of strip really so near Venetian, Paris, Bellagio). This is not the best hotel on the strip by any means but room was fine and had no issues. Service adequate and lines were not too bad for checkin or for the elevators. The buffet breakfast was not bad but worth going to the Bellagio which costs maybe $4 more but was much better. Would stay here again. The casino is one of the more smoky ones on the strip so non smokers may like this less."
267,376,"May 25 2009 	ITEMS STOLEN FROM ROOM	WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD. My husband and I are easy to please but this was like hell. My husband has to take medicine for an illness. We specifically remember leaving the bottle of pain medicine on the table because he would need it after we returned. IT WAS GONE, EVEN THE 2 LOSE PILLS THAT WERE RESTING ON THE TABLE. The hotel police assured me that we both have just been drinking and his employees have done nothing. The investigation done was a joke. Then a fire siren was under repair during the time we were sleeping (daytime).... it took 3 hours. The next day there was some kind of drillling for constuction on the floor above us. The casino took forever to bring complimentary drinks. 1 per hour. We didnt get any sleep and my husband had to finish the trp in pain. The problem is the quality of staff they hire, I dont think half of them would pass a background check. We were fine with the hotel smelling musty and being very old, we were trying to save our money for spending but I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. *********************IMPORTANT NOTE *************Stay away from those timeshare presentations that give you a free show for attending. The Wyndham Manager was very sleazy, we signed a mini contract saying if we stay for 2 hours we get the show tickets. They wouldnt let us leave without buying time share and when I tried to tell him we signed a deal in writing he stated, &quot;I dont care what that paper says if you dont sign your not getting any tickets.&quot; After 6 hours... 6 HOURS!!! we finally were given some dumb impersonation show tickets and not the Cirque ones we were promised."
268,376,"May 24 2009 	Excellent Location!	We stayed here for 5 nights over Easter break. It's an ideal time for visiting Las Vegas as the heat wasn't too oppressive (unlike August!).The IP has a fabulous central strip location. It's a little bit tired, but for the money, I'm not sure it can be beaten! The room was big and light and airy with a comfortable bed and a small balcony with lovely views of the mountains at the back of the strip. When we checked in, we were given a choice of rooms and I would recommend one at the back with this view - much quieter!The bathroom was a bit dark, but the shower had incredible water pressure - it gave a massage at the same time! An excellent start to the day.The hotel itself was like a rabbit warren - get the wrong lift and you walk around for a while! Quite a few eating choices, reasonably priced - although in Las Vegas, you can go anywhere!A great base, but could do with a facelift perhaps? For what we paid though, it was great value!"
269,376,May 24 2009 	Loved it 	We spent 3 nights here in the delux love tub room free on comps &amp; loved it. We had great housekeeping service every day. Fresh linens everyday. All staff was very friendly &amp; helpful. Wasn't impressed with the burger place but spent most of our time out &amp; about so found other places to eat. Check in was the only bad part of our trip. Spent about an hour in line. Would recommend to anyone.
270,376,"May 21 2009 	What do you expect for $15/night?	We got a ridiculous deal through one of the travel websites and once flights were out of the way, the hotel worked out to $15/night! Split that between 4 guys that were looking for a launching pad for the party that is Vegas...and you can't beat a deal like that. Anyways, getting to the useful information.Check In - We got there at 9am on a Sunday...line up was huge and not moving at all. One of the clerks was busy telling every person that came to the counter her life story and literally in the time it took to get one person checked in...the other girl did three! So tried the old slipping the $20 bill in with the id/credit card trick...she didn't even take the money and didn't even acknowledge us when we asked if an upgrade was available. First time ever that has happened to me. Room - Well...it was hotel room that I'm pretty sure looked the same as it did when I stayed there last time...15 years ago! But really, for the amount of time we spent there...it was perfect. There was a little deck to stand on while we smoked, the a/c worked like a charm even if it was a little noisy. TV was small but worked fine if you wanted to find out how to play Blackjack or something. Cleaning service was great and efficient, left us extra towels when we asked for them and even an extra garbage can that we used as a cooler. Elevators - Brutal and slow...always packed around check in time and not a lot of room to begin with. When you put the four of us in it...there wasn't much room and we're not exactly fatty fat fats.Pool - One pool and one hot tub. (hot tub in 30plus celsius weather? no thanks) The little waitresses were quick and seemed to know exactly when your drink was ready to be refilled...but look out man, when you're used to drinking for free at the machines/tables...it get expensive when you sign off on a few buckets o beer. Food was perfect for poolside. Burgers and dogs. Music seemed like we had time warped to the 80's but that was fine. Who doesn't want to hear a little old school Motley Crue when you're drinking in the sun by the pool?Dealertainers - These guys are money! Not one of them would pass as the actual celebrity that they're impersonating, but to be able to stay in character while dealing cards...like when Michael Jackson does a little spin when the house gets Blackjack...too funny. Nightclub - With your room key you get free access to the bar across from the lobby...it's worth a look but I'll say this. I've never been &quot;hey baby&quot;d by so many, um, working girls in my life in one location. Ugh... Decent crowd though. We were there Sunday through Thursday night and stopped in there for a while each night. It's always a busy scene and not as fru fru as some of the other clubs in Vegas. Shuttle Service - To airport/Freemont/anywhere...non-existent....Restaurants - We ate at the Teahouse on the first day after check in...and it's a lot like a meal you'd expect at a truckstop. Lots of food, and you walk away full...but it's not gourmet by any means. Here again, you get what you pay for and for the $7 I spent...I was satisfied.Location - Perfect. Monorail is right there...Freemont is a $15 cab ride if you want. You're close to the Fashion Mall if you have to pick up stuff for friends back home.I'd definitely recomend this place to guys that were going for a stag party and just need a staging area for the night's activities. I'd post photos...but for this trip what happened in Vegas...stayed in Vegas...."
271,376,"May 21 2009 	Location location location	That's the best thing about the place. It seriously needs an upgrade/overhaul.When we reserved, we were told that the beds were Queens, but they were only full sized.The rooms haven't been upgraded since my last trip there 14 years ago! The bedspreads were very worn.With that said, the location is awesome. Also, please get some new entertainment - we saw the Luau, the car museum, and Legends in 1995 already."
272,376,May 21 2009 	Do not STAY HERE TERRIBLE.	Stayed here before that is why we returned hotel dirty gone down hill half of the restarants are closed room dirty found long hair alot in my bed and did not get the suite i ordered pool never any chairs opens late great location to strip put a charge on my sons credit card that never happened still awaiting credit.Do not take the stairs down no way out no fire doors have to come back up and bang on door hopefully someone will open it for you elevators old and very slow.You have to pay for ice now from machines.Very disappointed will not return and tell my friends not to.I hear New York hotel great.
273,376,"May 20 2009 	Not the worst I have stayed at but could have done better for the money	We arrived on a Wednesday mid-afternoon so check in was fairly quick. The staff was friendly at all times but the hotel lacked in so many other ways it would be hard to recommend. The layout for the rooms is crazy and as others have noted, the elevators are slow and many times only one working out of 4. Room was clean, beds were comfy but I was really surprised to see a 19&quot; TV. I thought they were all dead. bring your own shampoo and conditioner because what ever they provide will tear your hair out. The food is overpriced and nothing less than terrible. I would suggest eating anywhere but there. If you have a folding cooler bag, pack it. That way you can at least keep drinks and snacks in your room. The location is good and that is a plus. Easy walking distance to great hotels and places to eat. (The buffet at Treasure Island is really good and less than $20.00.) The gaming was not too bad, but I prefer O'Shay's right next door. We chose it because we didn't want to spend much on the hotel to leave more money gambling. Next time I'll stick to my favorite, Golden Nugget downtown."
274,376,"May 19 2009 	Centre Strip great location you don't spend much time in your room in Vegas anyway	Stayed here for 4 nights and had a high floor strip view room. Great view of the strip however it is loud, and the music is still continuing at 4 in the morning. It can be so loud you can't hear your tv properly. If you come to vegas though, you don't come to spend time in your room so it was great for us.Great Drink prices in the bar downstairs. We had a smoking room and I'm not a smoker but the smell was bearable. There were occassions where we would come up to our room and all you could smell was marajuana. Obviously the security in the building don't care what goes on in the rooms. Don't expect a 5star hotel the pool is nice but always packed so we used the hotel harrahs next door. (This is fine as they are both owned under the same company). Would be great to have a fridge in your room though.Would I stay here again?? Maybe, but probably just pay a little bit extra and stay at Harrah's or Flamingos which is right next to it.This is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip, so if your looking for a bed to sleep on and nothing more imperial palace is great."
275,376,"May 19 2009 	Not great but works if you're on a budget or in a pinch.	I would say the customer serive we experienced was pretty average. The elevators were always incredibly packed. The room was very outdated and not very clean. There were some little hairs in the bathroom and some weird pink stuff I had to wipe up. I had some other family stay in the hotel on the same floor as us. My sister said her room was disgusting and my brother said his shower leaked. It's not a great place to stay, but I doubt it's the worst out there either. It worked for us because we were looking for something cheap on the strip, but I don't think I would stay here again."
276,376,"May 18 2009 	Great bargain Vegas hotel- poker players	This hotel isn't plush, and it isn't trendy, but it is clean, small, and perfect for those who aren't in their room much, Poker players love it here. Rooms are clean, but basic, and a bit old fashioned. It is also a lot cheaper than some others, so if you are spending a lot on upgraded flights, and want to make a saving elsewhere, here is great. I liked the fact it was not snobby, it was chilled out, and a bit tacky (The Dealatainers) and fun.Great central strip location, and super cheap rates."
277,376,"May 17 2009 	No luxury but clean and in a great location	This is a hotel that offers the basics: Clean sheets, clean towels, hot water, cable TV. If you're looking for Vegas luxury, look elsewhere. If you need a bargain hotel in a good location, stay at the Imperial Palace."
278,376,"May 17 2009 	I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy	After reading several reviews before my recent trip to Las Vegas I still decided to go with the Imperial Palace. After all I was thinking it is just somewhere to rest my head while I am out and about on the city. Well let me start of by saying when we arrived at the hotel around 9pm. There was a long line for check in and only 3 desk agents. We waited roughly 30 min to be checked into our room. After this long wait we were given wrong information from the desk agent as to which set of elevators to take. So we take the first set as instructed by the front desk. We then had to walk around the 14th floor for 15 min before we found our room. So we arrive at the hotel at 9pm and step into our room for the first time at 5 min til 10pm. Keep in mind this is just night one. Well we shower up and get ready to herad out for the night. One good thing about this hotel is the shower head pressure. Very nice shower. Anyway we make our way out, we loved the location of this hotel, we were near Harrahs Carnival Court, Jimmy Buffetts margaritaville, caesars, mirage, flamingo, all within 5 min walk. After out first night out we head back to the IP and want something to eat. Well the only thing open is the overpriced Burger Palace. The burger was so-so, fries were cool and had been sitting. We wake up the next day to find out that for whatever reason our buffett was closed for the day, Embers the &quot;nice&quot;restaurant of the IP does not open til 5pm neither does the pizza palace. So once again if we wanted food we had the only option of the burger palace. We declined and went next door to Harrahs for the buffett. Which was awesome. Food quality and selection was awesome. After several more days of being unsatisfied with the IP we were on our way home, or so we thought, we were bumped from our flight and had to get another room for one more night, we well chose the Excalibur, and loved it. We regret not chosing the Excalibur for the entire trip. I guess the moral of my story is if you want anything good in Vegas it is not at the Imperial Palace. Not only would I not recommend this hotel to a friend I would not recommend it to my enemy. Any fun we had or good food we ate did not come from this location. Thank goodness we were close to actual nice places. I wish like the other outdated places in Vegas the IP would be torn down and make room for something a little more upscale."
279,376,"May 16 2009 	Definetly didn't stay for the elevators.	This hotel is in a prime hotspot location. The price was great and definetly affordable BUTfor the amount of people and rooms that this place has, they NEED to get their elevators fixed. This hotel is weirdly designed since you have to walk through a maze to get to an elevator to get to your room, but when you find the elevator you have to wait an addititonal 20 minutes to get a ride in it."
280,376,May 16 2009 	Reasonable accommodation in great location	I stayed at Imperial Palace from Wed 6 May to Wed 13 May and managed to get a great deal online which worked out at less than $300 for 7 nights in a Deluxe Room.Check in was on a Wed morning  I checked in 2 to 3 hours early which was no problem - there was around 20 mins wait for check in.The put me in a room with a view of the mountains (not the older Capri tower)  the advantages of this were that the noise levels were fine and I was close to the Monorail plus the back entry to Harrahs.Apparently the rooms on the strip side get some loud noise from the night club until the early hours of the morning.The room itself was very basic and whilst everything was clean/comfortable it was definitely the most budget room I have had in all my visits to Vegas  although this is comparing to Bellagio/Signature at MGM/Planet Hollywood/Ballys/Excalibur.For someone travelling on their own and not planning on spending much time in their room but wanting a good location  I think Imperial Palace is a good option.If you are travelling with a partner I would recommend upgrading to a nicer room or even staying somewhere else.The layout of the Imperial Palace is a bit confusing at first but eventually you can figure it out.The casino is quite cramped and a bit worn down compared to other casinos on the strip  it does have a good atmosphere especially with the Dealertainers who not only are dealers but each play the character of an entertainer and get up to sing a couple of songs throughout the evening  the Freddy Mercury and Elvis Presley characters always seemed to attract a crowd.The sportsbook at Imperial Palace is actually located on the third floor  would have been one of the worst sportsbooks on the strips and even though it is quite large never seemed to have more than 3 or 4 people there  they were unable to take bets on any Boston Celtics games because the CEO of the Harrahs group is associated with the team  so this often meant going somewhere else anyway.The poker room was not bad but was also quite hard to get a game at times.The restaurants at the hotel were not that great  the buffet was the worst I have had in Vegas as far as variety and service went  the Pizza place was ok but nothing special  Burger Palace which seemed to be their only 24 hour restaurant made reasonably good burgers  I often ended up venturing next door to Harrahs or OSheas for something quick to eat.
281,376,"May 14 2009 	Do not stay here!	We spent 4 nights here and what a dump! During our stay we only got maid service once, the elevators were scary and the room was a nightmare. We gambled approx. $1000 here only received $9.00 in comps..........it was pathetic. The only good thing about this hotel is the location, but I would rather stay at the MGM or Bally's as they are on the monorail route and easy to get anywhere from these two locations. The Buffet here was horrible and we will never stay at the Imperial Palace again!"
282,376,May 14 2009 	Will never stay again	My reservations got lost even though I called to confirm and my credit card had already been charged. Everyone I talked to about it was rude and it never got resolved. The place is a dump. The &quot;deluxe&quot; room looks like it would be at a motel 6. The housekeeper came once and didn't even really clean up. The pool is also a piece of crap and the waitress walking around the pool had horrible service. I will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone.
283,376,"May 14 2009 	So Much Fun	Let me say I love staying at the IP. It's not the most luxrious place in town, but they make me feel welcome everytime my girlfriend and I stay there. I could stay at other hotels that are also owned by Harrah's Resorts, and most always for free, but the thing is I like the IP. This time around we stayed in the Deluxe King Suite which was comped the whole time we were there. The room has been remodeled and was very nice and comfortable and very large. It also had a wet bar. I recommend the 17th floor. We had a really nice view overlooking the pool and a great view of the mountains. We just love the room. Oh and it also had a very large love tub with mirrored walls all the way around. The bed also had a mirror above on the ceiling. Once you leave the room be sure to explore the hotel to see all that it has. If you like Karaoke then you are in luck. They have karaoke every night. The IP also has several pretty darn good places to eat some good food when you are hungry. The IP also has somewhat of a convienence store that is open 24 hours. Now be sure to go next door to Harrah's also for some great dueling pianos before you leave town. I could go on and on but beleive me you can't beat the Imperial Palace for location and price. Cheapest place to stay on the strip. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks and have a great time if you choose the Imperial Palace."
284,376,"May 13 2009 	Great Deal For Strip Location	Stayed at the IP May 8-11th...Great Deal for 3 Nights 163.00USD for the Deluxe Room. Basic rooms with two queen beds. Clean rooms, large bathroom. Hotel had room included balcony that overlooked the Hahara's Pool.All in all Great deal for location!"
285,376,"May 13 2009 	Not bad at all.	Wow!, after reading some reviews about this hotel I was really impressed by what we found when we arrived. Some people wrote bad reviews but this is definately not one of them. Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay for the money. For its age, the place is in very good condition and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The casino floor is always rocking and the slots are fair. The view of the strip from the 14th floor at night was stunning. Our room overlooked the carnival tent and listening to the bands play were a great way to wind down late at night. Sure, a lot of people would like to have a nice quiet place to sleep, but this is Las Vegas. Unfortunately we did not get to eat at all the dining spots, but the Burger Palace does a great burger and the beer is always ice cold. The only bad thing about our trip was a minor problem with some elevators. Other than that, I would definately recommend Imperial Palace as a good hotel to stay in. Dennis Lewis"
286,376,"May 13 2009 	Best value for location and FUN!	Imperial Palace used to show its age much more, but having stayed there a dozen-plus times I can tell you the remodeled rooms are quite nice. Keep in mind, if you're booking Imperial you're doing so because it's a budget property, but based on that criteria, you'll be hard-pressed to find a nicer budget hotel anywhere. I've tried Stratosphere, Downtown, flamingo, Excalibur and other low-rent properties, and nothing tops Imperial Palace. There's something about having your blackjack cards dealt to you by Alice Cooper, Madonna, Prince or Cher that puts a smile on your face. If you go in expecting a big-casino operation, you'll be disappointed. But nighly Karaoke, fun atmosphere, a fair selection of restaurant choices, and a truly fun rock 'n roll casino make this feel more like a Carnival cruise than a Vegas setting. Right across the street from Caesar's Palace in the heart of The Strip, it's right where you want to be, at a price 75% below the big boys. Count me in, Baby!"
287,376,"May 12 2009	Worst hotel on the strip	We stayed at Imperial Palace and did not like anything about it. First off when we go to check in there was a long line with only 2 people working at the counter. Once it was finally our turn, we were surprized to find out that there was a $120 security deposit, leaving us with less spending money for the week. DO NOT EAT AT BURGER PALACE!!!!!!!!!! McDonalds is a 5 star restraunt compared to that. We tried the Emporers Buffet, not horrible for the price. The casino, pool, and restraunts are rather boring compared to all the other hotels. The rooms are old and somewhat drity. My feet were BLACK just from walking in our room. No exaderation but it took nearly 15 minutes just to get from the front of the hotel to our room. The hallways are so long and windly its a maze to find anyting in that hotel. Took almost an hour just to find our room when we checked in. We had 6 people staying there between 3 rooms. All 6 keys simutaniously stopped working. Leaving us to walk a mile to the front desk to get a working one, to walk a mile back to the room. Spend a few extra bucks to get a nicer hotel it would be worth it."
288,376,"May 12 2009 	Don't let the poor reviews keep you from saving a ton of money by staying here	We just returned from a 4-day, 3-night stay at the Imperial Palace. Based on recent reviews, I was very worried about what the casino and rooms would be like and considered booking elsewhere. I'm very glad I saved my money and stuck with the IP. Was this the best place I've ever stayed, no, it wasn't, but it also wasn't the worst. You get what you pay for! Our room was basic but the bed was comfortable and even for a smoking room, it wasn't bad. The bathroom was fine and the housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping you stocked with plenty of towels. The casino floor isn't the best but you are so close to other casino's (we like O'Sheas and Casino Royale for the cheap drinks) that it wasn't a problem. The pool was fine. Plenty of lounge chairs. Try a Miami Vice drink poolside. Very tasty. Will we stay here the next time we come to Vegas, probably not but we never stay the same place twice. We will stay with a Harrah property."
289,376,May 11 2009 	great hotel	just back from vegas and could not say a bad thing about this hotel the rooms are large and cleaned every day . would stay here again with no hesitation .
290,376,"May 11 2009 	Not as Bad as I was expecting	We stayed here for 3 nights from April 25 through April 28. When I checked in , I announced that I would be writing a review on TripAdvisor and preferred a quiet room on a higher floor. I got Room 16128 on the 16th floor at the back of the hotel. There was no great view-parking lots and backs of buildings but NO NOISE. I felt for the people who were staying at the front of the hotel, especially the ones on lower floors, because there was a lot of noise on the strip. The room looked like a 1970's Holiday Inn room. There were 2 double beds, a good tv with local channels and a few cable channels (ESPN etc), a table with chairs. The a/c worked fine. There was no safe-a big negative that should be updated. The bathroom was standard with tub/shower combo and a clean sink area. There were basic amenities such as shampoo and soap. The ice bucket was there also, and free ice was available near the elevators, about 100 feet away. Sometimes there were drunk people in the hallway, but that could occur anywhere. The elevators were slow as everybody states, but I never had to wait more than 2 minutes. There was usually entertainment from the drunk guests but nothing violent or offensive. The location was fantastic and was convenient to everything. I had breakfast in the restaurant on the 2nd floor. It was not the best but was comped based on my Total Rewards-a definite must for anyone staying at a Harrah's property. I had stayed at the Paris last December and had been receiving offers ever since so I decided to return, but the only available place with a comp room was the Imperial Palace so that's where I stayed-so great for the price (free). I also had received a coupon for 2 free buffets at the Rio so I took the free shuttle bus there for a fantastic buffet with something for everybody. The free shuttles leave from the Paris or Harrahs next door. They also give you a coupon book at check in so I got my free Flamingos and Harrahs tee shirts after about 20 minutes on the slots. There was also a discount coupon for the prime rib/Chinese place at Bill's, but I didn't realize I had one until I ate there the first night an did not have a chance to return. The casino wasn't as smoky as I was expecting, and I had fun playing the slots and drinking free beers. I lost a few hundred but had a great time. I am planning another trip in the fall and hope to stay at another Harrah's property so I can continue to sample them all. Good luck to all!"
291,376,"May 11 2009 	Perfect location great value for money	I loved this hotel, it was recomended to me by a good friend so I knew it would be ok, but after seeing some reviews I didn't have high expectations. I was pleasently surprised when we turned up, we had a room on the 7th floor at the back with a view of the mountains, it was very quiet at night. The location of this hotel is just spot on, right in the middle of thr strip, opposite Ceaser's Palace - last time I stayed in the Excalibur and it was just too far away from all the buzz of the Strip. It's an old school Hotel, with a dated Casino but I thought it just added to the experience of being in Vegas - take the old with the new I say and just enjoy the whole experience. The Casino has a Celebrity look-a-like pit and they have the best Elvis I've ever seen, and Freddie Murcury was excellent as well. The pool was good and the frozen cocktails were delishious.10 out of 10 - will recomend this hotel to everyone I know who is going to Vegas."
292,376,May 11 2009 	can't beat this place	stayed may 4-6. Asked if we could be upgraded at check in and was given a nice suite on 18th floor. All the staff was very friendly and nice. The bed was very comfortable and the pressure in the shower is great. You can't beat this place for the value and great location. Thank you to everyone at IP.
293,376,"May 11 2009 	great location 	We have just booked our 4th trip to Vegas &amp; will be staying at the IP for the 3rd time. You have to remember that you get what you pay for. The location is fantastic, ask for a quiet room when you check in and it's fine. Although not luxurious, rooms have basics e.g toiletries, hairdryer, TV - anyway, how much time do you spend in your room when in Vegas????Bus stops are close, free shuttle from Harrahs to the Rio, also Starbucks for that late night coffee, Dennys for breakfast.All in all a good value place to stay - the money you save on a more expensive hotel can be spent on trips, food, gambling etc."
294,376,"May 10 2009 	Working class crowd with great location	I stayed here for five nights at the start of May for Boxing.The hotel is in the middle of the strip across from ceasers palace,great location.The atmosphere in the Imperial is great at the bars due to the working class clientele that stay here.You can have a drink and a laugh,it is no problem,great fun.The hotel is always busy which adds to the atmosphere.We had a strip view room which was great although the noise from carnival court is loud and lasts from 11am until 3 am so if you want peace make sure you dont get a strip view room.The pool is adequate.For a budget hotel with a great location choose the Imperial,we had a ball.The other hotels in Vegas are more classier,ceasers,mandalay,mgm,etc but have absolutely no atmosphere and are not worth the extra money..."
295,376,May 9 2009 	Pay a few more dollars and go somewhere nicer	We paid $50USD a night and you get what you pay for. The rooms are very dated and feel dirty and grimey. The casino attracts a pretty dodgy crowd. If I went again I would pay $100 USD and stay somewhere like the Venetian which was gorgeous. Was located in a good spot on the strip.
296,376,"May 9 2009 	Don't believe the bad reviews its excellent !!	Just returned from Las Vegas and stayed at the imperial palace, dont believe the poor reviews, the hotel couldnt be better located, its clean and got everything you need. Right in the middle of the strip, better located than MGM or Mandalay bay. The hotel has its own monorail stop which is so convienient but the deuce bus is better value and again stops right outside. The imperial palace may not be the poshest hotel but if you just need a value for money hotel in a fantastic location then dont look anywhere else."
297,376,"May 8 2009 	OK but..........	Checked in Monday night 05/04, staff was friendly. Our room on the 13th floor at first seemed ok, but I noticed a partially used complimentary shampoo left on the tub shelf by the previous occupants. Then a moth died in front of the patio door and it was STILLTHERE on Friday morning 05/08 when we checked out, I of course assume the room was not vacuumed properly or at all. Then on Friday morning as we were packing up I noticed a blood spot on the bedspread. Didn't see that prior, or I would have brought itto someones attention. Location is fabulous. Burger place not the greatest. Did not try the buffet. Too many timeshare people right near the elevator. And I would have likedan in-room coffee pot. Why don't hotels have this amenity? Dealertainers are fabulous.It was my first stay there and probably my last. Too bad, its such a bargain price-wise, and as long as business is down, they should see that the customers they do have are happy."
298,376,"May 7 2009 	Stay There All The Time	I have really never had any issues, other than they need more people at check in.I stay there every time I go out to Vegas and have never had any complaints.If I wanted a high classed room and wanted to pay the price..........I would stay at one of THOSE hotels.............I just want a room that is clean and inexpensive with a good location and I have that with this hotel!IF I had to pay more for a hotel, I would not be able to spend money on fun things to do, on shopping and certainly not on gambling. As they say :&quot;location location location&quot; and they sure have that!"
299,376,"May 6 2009 	Great Value!	I read the other reviews of the hotel before we booked and thought we would take a chance since some were good and some were bad. My wife and I had no real complaints. The hotel is located in a great location, it was affordable, and we had a good time there. We stayed on the 14th floor and was told it was the quieter section of the hotel by the desk clerk. Noise was definitely not an issue from our room. We only ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was average. They had a sign posted out side of what they were serving on it and that was a big help to decide whether or not to eat there. Another plus was that it was connected to the mono rail. After a couple of days of walking the strip, our legs were sore and the mono rail came in handy! As I said before the location was great! The Mirage was across the street, Harrahs was right next door and other places like the Venetian, Treaure Island, and Fashion Show Mall were within a short walking distance. The people staying at the hotel were a mixture of young and old. So I really couldn't say which age group was more dominant there. I also seen other reviews of people talking about a weird smell in the place. Neither my wife nor I noticed it. Overall the hotel was a great place for us to stay for our first trip to Vegas. Would I stay there again, the answer is yes!"
300,376,"May 6 2009	location excellent	had a great stay at this hotel, its location is excellent for exploring all of the strip. only complaint dont get a room overlooking Harrahs as you will be kept awake till 2pm with the live music. rooms large, clean and comfy would recommend this as a budget hotel."
301,376,May 6 2009 	Great Location	My sister and I take a vacation in Las Vegas every year but normally stay downtown. We decided to try staying on the strip for the first time this year. We had a great package deal for IP. The Imperial Palace is a great location. We were able to walk around and still go back to our room if needed. The hotel room condition was old but it was clean. The housekeeping staff was great. They always asked if we needed anything when passing them. I look forward to staying at IP again next year.
302,376,"May 6 2009 	Amazing location	I had read a few bad reviews for this hotel so I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised. Ok you get what you pay for. It's a basic hotel but it was clean, the shower was wonderfully powerful and the rooms were a decent size. It provided us with somewhere to sleep which is all you really need in Vegas. Who goes to Vegas to stay in their hotel room! I'd heard that rooms at the front of the hotel could be noisy and certainly we could hear the bands on at the Carnival Court quite clearly but as soon as we switched on the air conditioning it drowned out everything else. I didn't have a problem sleeping. The Imperial Palace is forgiven all of it's flaws when you walk out onto the strip into the middle of everything. The location is amazing and, with the price, this hotel is a bargain!"
303,376,"May 5 2009 	great value best location great variety of restaurants	in over 17 years of coming to the IMPERIAL palace, we have never had a bad time.in our experience over the years, the average traveler can have a great time without having to break the bank. most of the newer hotels are nice,but they don't have the friendly feeling that you have at the I.P ."
304,376,"May 5 2009 	Old but comfortable in a great location.	Stayed 4 nights last week and was pleasantly surprised on first impressions. Room was clean but basic with a balcony overlooking Harrah's pool which was a bonus. Found it difficult to sleep because of the noise of A/C (at least it worked) and the outrageous volume of the music from Harrahs. I enjoyed the Casino with the dealer entertainers very professional, and there was no shortage of waitresses bringing you free drinks ( dont forget the$ tip tho). Swimming pool was good for a chill out with no shortage of towells and beds. Best Restaurant we went to has to be Voga at the Flamingo where they transform what seems to be a basic meal from the menu into a gastro delight. &quot;Legends in Concert&quot; at Hurrahs was brill but i suggest you buy tickets, as for all shows, from one of the many 1/2 price ticket booths you find along the Strip.Overall, IP is a cheap and cheerful place to stay."
305,376,"May 5 2009 	Great value for money - ideal location	This hotel is located in an ideal location right in the heart of the Vegas strip (opposite Ceaser's Palace). It's true that the rooms are a little dated and worn, however during my stay they were cleaned every day to a good standard. This may not be the best place to stay if you're having a romantic getaway with your partner, but is an ideal place to come if you're in a group of friends wanting to make the most of the Vegas nightlife.This is certainly not a luxury hotel however my overall rating reflects the value for money that I think this place offers."
306,376,"May 4 2009 	What a dump!!	This is probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It is one step above prison. The hotel is old and rundown. The dcor is really outdated. It was probably considered fashionable when it opened about 50 years ago. The hotel a damp, smell to it. And to make it worst, the tub did not drain when showering. So while taking a shower you have water up to your ankles. The beds were pretty uncomfortable too. The only positive was the location, Its right in the middle of the strip. The front desk staff was pleasant as well. The only people who should stay here are the 25 and under crowd who just needs somewhere to store there luggage while our partying."
307,376,"May 4 2009 	Bargain rate for Outstanding location	Stayed at the IP with a group of friends for 4 nights from 5th April. We were a bit concerned after reading some reviews, however these just seemed to not be true or to be based on unrealistic expectations.Anyone from Europe or Australia should not have any concern about staying here. The rooms were in good condition, clean and at $27 a night excellent value. The location of this hotel is simply fantastic. Contrary to reports on this site we did not have any problems with waiting for elevators, long check-in, no dirty rooms, no dirty sheets and we had no expectations of having coffee machines etc in our rooms. What do some people expect for $27 a night.Quite simply I would stay at the IP again on any future visits to Vegas. The IP is not the best hotel, but it never claims to be. It is what it seems a well located, bargain rate hotel in an excellent mid-strip location."
308,376,"May 4 2009 	What at terrible experience	I am a dimond member first time staying at Imperial Palace. I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or anyone to stay. I was promised by a rep with all exiting and great strip view room. I was totally exited and cant wait to be there, but when I got there, things totall different from what I was offered and was never fullfilled the satisfaction. Unfriendly staffs, frontdesk supervior was not very helpful, all she did was to apoligize. Looking for my room like it was going thru a maze. Elevators were down and it took us between 5-9 minutes to get down. Room was dirty, very small for a delux suit for a double queen beds and a small TV. I give a tremondous credits for celebrity dealers though. They worked really hard to put on a show every night."
309,376,"May 2 2009 	Great experience	We stayed the week of April 26th. We wanted a good inexpensive clean place to stay with a good location, so we could afford as many Vegas experiences as possible! The location was wonderful ! It is located in mid strip, next to Harrahs. We had no problems or complaints. Rooms were just the right size, clean, and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had plans to see Vegas, not sit in our rooms. We never made it to the pool or experienced the other amenities. There were six elevators near us and three more around the corner, but each morning they were packed with visitors on their way to check out. Later in the day, we never had to wait. Our room was quiet. The rooms facing the strip may hear the noise from the streets. There is music playing from several nearby locations on the street. Hey, this is Vegas ! We had a great experience and cant wait to go back."
310,376,May 2 2009 	Don't Bother Unless You Just Want Cheap!	The updated rooms aren't bad but the service at Imperial Palace hotel staff is poor. They messed up my reservation by showing I checked out a day early and then rebooked my room to someone else. I came back to the hotel to find someone sitting in my room waiting for their friends to got their room rebooked. I'm just glad everything in my room wasn't stolen. They offered a $40 dinner but that didn't even cover the food and liquor in my room I had to throw out.. It is in a very good location on the strip though.
311,376,"May 2 2009	Second stay at Imperial palace and would stay again.	Stayed at the Imperial Palace from April 26th thru 30th. This was our second stay at the Imperial Palace and would definately come back. Room was clean, staff very courteous and helpful. Asked for a room with a vier of the Strip and was advised that it would be noisey. Appreciated this information but said that wouldn't bother us and were given a room on the 16th floor with a view. The only thing was that the 16th floor is where the Imperial Palace sign was so view was limited. Previous stay we were on the 13th floor and view was much better. Do however think that there could be a better choice of eating places at the Imperial Palace. Because of the limited choices we chose to eat elsewhere. Did enjoy breakfast at the Tea House.Whenever in Las Vegas will make the Imperial Palace our choice of a place to stay."
312,376,"Apr 30 2009 	Old run down hotel in a good location!	I wish I would have started here before making reservations. The hotel was old 20 years ago when I stayed there and I don't think anything has been done since. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and you are doing everything elsewhere, then you may not mind staying if old and slow doesn't bother you.From the time we arrived with our luggage in tow to when we left we were constantly harassed by the staff pushing Tahiti Village. Every time we passed the booth to go to the elevators we were asked. It got old very fast! They try to bribe you with show tickets to sign up for the tour and sales pitch, typical time share stuff.The elevators were slow, luckily we stayed on weekdays when it was not as crowded. The Buffet cost was too much ($18.99), however the prime rib was excellent, especially don't go if you are looking forward to the seafood, it was all served on ice.The rooms were outdated with mirrors on the ceiling and the Luv Tub was just a big bathtub with no jets, should have asked ahead of time. The bathtub had missing caulk and what appeared to be mold growing in the corner.We went downtown to the Freemont Experience and decided that for the value and what it had to offer we would stay downtown next time, much more activity and fun!"
313,376,"Apr 29 2009 	I was surprized....it really was OK	We arrived for check in at 9:30 am. No lines at check in. We had reserved 1 smoking and 1 nonsmoking room then decided we would rather have adjoining rooms. I'm a no smoker but would give in so we could all be together. They accomodated us Got smoking rooms 18144 &amp; 46 facing the pool. The rooms were OK. Pretty generic. Had an old tv but it had cable and a good picture. Carpet was worn with a few small stains. You really couldn't tell it was a smoking room. Had a balcony with a sliding glass door which we loved --nothing like fresh air. One bad thing - I looked at my bedspread &amp; I saw what appeared to either be dried mustard or puke. The housekeeper was just down the hall and I asked her to come in &amp; see this yellow stuff. She freaked-yelled &quot;oh my God, oh my God. It was another shift. Oh my god.&quot; She immediately pulled the bedspread off &amp; it was replaced with a clean one-apologizing prufusely. Bathroom-clean. Water pressure very good. The Main elevators are very slow but if you go past the gift shops up to the escalators (toward the monorail station) then up another escalator to the 2nd floor- there is another set of elevators that were alot faster. Yes it really is maze- like but worth it. Our room was very close to this set of elevators so we really didn't have to wait at all our whole trip. The casino was fun. I didn't think it was dark or smokey at all. I thought Harrah's was the smokiest casino we went in. Waitress service was good. The pool was clean and spacious. Always plenty of chairs available. Hot dogs and hamburgers are grilled by the pool. $3.79 for a 1/4lb hot dog-good, too. I ate the brunch buffet once. It was OK not bad just OK. We stayed there because the room was comped and they offered me a $100 Macy Gift Card. The location is great. Would I stay there again? Probably, if it was the only free room I could get in that part of the strip. I asked for a late check out @ 2pm and got it. The casino host printed our boarding passes for us. Over all service was good and everyone very pleasant. It's just an old hotel that really is showing it's age. I was expecting it to be alot worse but it really was OK. You get what you pay for! You want cheap? Don't be afraid to stay at IP. It really was OK."
314,376,"Apr 29 2009 	The Motel 6 of Vegas Strip Hotels	This was our first time at IP, but not at Harrah's properties or Vegas. This was definitely the lowest quality hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas. I have stayed at Excalibur, Harrah's, Pallazo, Mirage, &amp; NY/NY. This was definite;y a case of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; or in our case what you don't pay for. There is very little luxury at this property, but it is dirt cheap for strip hotels. Lobby and casino is out dated and not much appeal. The restaurants are nothing to brag about, but I would avoid room service and head down to the 24 hour burger joint, it's cheaper. The pool was nice and service was very courteous &amp; towels were clean and fairly good quality.LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! That is what you are paying for with IP. You are in the middle of the strip with easy access to Caesars &amp; Mirage across the street as well as Venetian/Pallazo up the street. Metro at the back of the property is also convenient.Stay/sleep here and gamble at other Harrah's properies &amp; casinos to get your money's worth. This hotel serves no virtually no other functions."
315,376,"Apr 29 2009 	Never again	We stayed here as part of a very good package deal - should have paid a bit more for another hotel. We stayed on the 16th and 18th floors, try not to get a room on the upper floors. The elevators were always packed and took forever. The ladies restroom on casino level flooded and I was told to go to the 3rd floor! Most casinos have at least two restrooms - one on each side! Not very friendly staff either. We had fun in spite of staying at Imperial Palace - they didn't eve acknowledge that it was my birthday when I checked in! When I go back, I will stay at Casino Royale, the casino is quite dumpy to some folks. When I stay there everyone is very nice to me and the rooms have been redone."
316,376,"Apr 29 2009	Find somewhere else to stay!!!!	I arrived with a group of 25 women to enjoy the strip and some much needed Girl Time. The front desk had all the reservation screwed up and insisted we all give our charge card numbers, even though the rooms were all paid by the organizer. The restaurant left a whole lot to be desired. We ended up eating at other hotels, Denny's, Panda Express, McDonalds, anywhere but here. My roommate and I were on the 11th floor, if the elevators weren't slow (15-20 minute wait) they were broke, we actually took the stairs. guess you can say we were on the &quot;loud&quot; side of the house. Two druken bridesmaid's decided that 3AM was the perfect time to have an argument that escalated into a fight outside of my room. The only positive was the friendly housekeepers when you asked for something that should have already been in your room."
317,376,"Apr 28 2009 	Great Location decent rooms lousy food and awful elevators!	This hotel is in a great location-center strip! Who could complain??? The &quot;noisy&quot; side is truly &quot;noisy&quot;. My family and friends and I all stayed on the 16th Floor. Big mistake. The elevators were SLOW and CROWDED all the time. We found 3 sets of elevators and you could easily wait about 10 minutes to get up or down. The buffet sucked! Do not spend your money there. In the midwest and the south, you get hot crab legs and whole ones. I have never been served cold crab legs that have been sliced in half. I was venture over to Harrah's for better food!"
318,376,"Apr 27 2009 	its not as bad as I thought it would be	Well I will say this...the location is prime! Considering where it is its a cheap hotel. With that being said, this is an old hotel. There are a lot of things that need to be updated: the rooms, elevators, restaurants. The food at the cafe is of poor quality. Eat some where else. The rooms are average, just the basic necessities. I stayed in room 909. The bathroom is in dire need of remodeling but its not horrible. If you get a room that is facing the strip get ready for lots of noise all day and all night. You see, the Carnival Bar is located right below you, and anyone trying to get some sleep will definitely be woken up. The windows don't stop any of the noise from coming in but on the flip side of that you have balconies that you can walk out on and watch the party at the bar. The elevators are the worst part of this hotel. Sometimes we waited 20 mins for the elevators and sometimes we had to wait for the next elevator which was the same elevator because only one was running.  Chances are I would never stay here again but for anyone who has to stay here its do-able. I would say the elevators were the worst part of the entire stay."
319,376,"Apr 26 2009 	Stay away!!!	Nasty, tacky hotel. We got the room for free through our Harrahs reward points. I would have preferred to pay for a room else-where. Rough sheets, rough towels, old shower-love tub combo with no curtain! Tacky mirrors everywhere! In the shower, over the bed . . . Front desk won't even answer their phones. The world's slowest elevators - you will literally wait for 5-10 minutes for an elevator to open up for you. Don't bother taking the stairs up every single floor is locked. Flea-market quality shops in the lobby. I will never ever stay at this hotel again! Hope this place gets demolished soon - it's time to make way for a high class hotel."
320,376,"Apr 25 2009 	You get what you pay for!	When our travel agent booked us here we were excited about the price and then come to find out, there were so many people we knew who stayed here and said it is the only place they stayed in Vegas. They all told us it was an older hotel, but was clean,which is all we cared about, not to mention the location, we are NOT picky people! However, We were really disappointed...and it takes a lot to disappoint us!! Our first day we had to be moved because sewage backed up in the bathtub and it STUNK!!! Management was very gracious about moving us, however the next room we were moved to didn't have the greatest plumbing either....sink/bathtub didn't drain. The carpet was stained and there was a cigarette butt outside of our door in the hallway for THREE days that didn't get picked up...YUCK! Just goes to show the cleanliness of the housekeeping staff!! I also had a bad experience with the watistaff on the floor. My husband &amp; I were playing slots for almost an hour and didn't have a waitress, so I cashed out to seek service and was told that it was shift change, which was understandable, however, the waitress that took my order followed me back to BE SURE I was gambling and stood behind me to watch and make sure I put my voucher back in the machine like I was a child (I'm in my late 30s) !! I was appalled!! I've stayed at the Excalibur prior to my visit at the IP and would definitely prefer to stay there over the IP in comparison to the value, not to mention there is more entertainment there than the IP! The pool was not open and it was the second week of April, which is pool season in Vegas! Packed my bathing suit for no reason! If you prefer to stay at a hotel where things are going on and you would prefer cleanliness, I wouldn't recommend this hotel!"

1,377,"Jan 6 2009 	Will Return My Next Trip	Made it a point this trip to visit North Vegas with some friends and found Jerry's Nugget to be a great place. I had a bowl of New England Clam Chowder in the diner and it was very, very good. Waitress was very friendly and pleasant. Loved the casino especially the nickel VP which I just recently started playing. I really liked the vibe of Jerry's and will return again and again."

3,377,"May 17 2005	Poor service from the Cocktail Waitresses	I was at your casino the very first time, May 12th in the evening. I was gambling on the slot machines with a friend, even with asking the change personel several times to get a waitress for cocktails, we couldn't get service even after spending several hundreds of dollars. I wouldn't recommend gambling here till the Casino pledges to improve their extremely poor cocktail staff service."
4,377,Mar 25 2004	Jerry's Nugget Las Vegas	I had been Jerry's Nugget on five occasions. I like the restraurant in the casino. The gambling in March 2004 was not that great because their slot machines were not up-to-date and the pay out was not that great. They need to install more new machines.
5,377,"Aug 10 2003	Bad Dining Experience	I have been visiting Jerry's Nugget for over 20 years and have not had a bad dining experience until Saturday 9 Aug 03. When I first arrived at Nellis AFB in 1982, I asked where I could get the best prime rib and the almost unanimous responsewas Jerry's Nugget. I like my prime rib medium rare and grilled and that's the way I ordered it on 9 Aug. When the meal arrived, the rib was medium rare but not grilled. I finally flagged down the waiter and brought this to his attention. He agreed that I had ordered it grilled and returned the rib to the kitchen. All this time my wife was consumingher meal and commenting how good it was adding to my dispair. About 10 minutes later, the rib was brought back out and in deed it was grilled but only on one side. The ungrilled side was down like it was being hidden. I waited until the waiter came by again and asked him if it was normal to grill only on one side. He said it was not. I requested the rib be returned to the kitchen a second time and I wanted a fresh piece of rib properly cooked, not that one just thrown back on the grill. Another 10 minutes past before the rib was returned. It was a different piece of meat, medium rare and grilled on both sides. Unfortunately it was a smaller piece and appeared to be an end cut as it was more done on one side than the other. By this time, my wife had finished her meal and my steak fries were cold.I asked to speak to the manager who agreed to ordered me fresh fries. By the time my new fries arrived, I had eaten all of the prime rib I wanted and was ready to leave. After waiting for several more minutes, I asked a bus boy to get our ticket from the waiter so we could leave as he did not seem interested in serving us any longer.I was very disappointed with the meal and the service. Would this experience keep me from dining a Jerry's Nugget again, maybe. I will think twice when the wife asks me where I want to eat next time."
6,377,"Dec 7 2002	Good solid gambling fare at Jerry's	Jerry's Nugget is the type of place where if you gamble there every day for 35 years, then drop dead, they will put a framed photo up of you near the check-in desk. And by the looks of all the framed late gamers, they appear to get regulars who come back for years and years. It's a good solid room for gaming, eating or what-have-you. Whenever I'm in Vegas which is at least once a year, I always stop in at least once and sometimes twice. Nothing too exciting going on here but then again sometimes thats exactly what the doctor ordered. Great low-key, kicking back type of hang. Nothing pretentious, just a good class act. You get the point I'm sure."
1,380,"May 14 2008 	Stay Clear. Especially with kids. Better off sleeping outside on a park bench.	this was one of the worst, scariest and least comfortable hotel experiences in my life. Absolutely terrible uncaring management."
2,380,"Mar 19 2008 	Not bad for the price	We were travelling back from L.A., and needed a place to stay for the night, before we flew home the next morning. Due to it being Spring Break, there were no other affordable choices. We were dreading checking in, and were excepting the worse. Allthough the place looked run down, the room appeared clean, the bed was comfortable (choose not to use the shower). It is close to the airport, didn't use the shuttle. If all you need is a place to sleep then this fits the bill!"

4,380,"Nov 25 2007 	Much better experience than other reviewers	I'm very surprised by the unanimity of bad experiences registered at Knights Inn Las Vegas.I spent one night here in April, 2007, and one more 3 weeks later.Reservation through Internet was OK and about both stays, the overall experience (cleanliness of the room and the bed included) of the room was good, shower excepted because only a hole in the ground of the bathroom and so it was impossible to keep out water spilled all around the bathroom when taking a shower. Almost equal to Motel 6 Tropicana. A little too noisy from room to room. Just under $ 45.00 (taxes included) for one night.The free airport shuttle was OK (used one time only when arriving) and the breakfast was correct.Was I particularly lucky ? (Useful in Las Vegas, ;-) )PG"
5,380,"Oct 16 2007 	Dirty Dingy and Dangerous	Dingy and dirty--don't stay here. The pictures posted on various websites are inaccurate. They are actually of a hotel called St. Tropez, not Knights Inn. Knights Inn shares a transportation van with St. Tropez.I called a hotels service that advertises that they know hotels to book a room for one night in Las Vegas. I asked for a room that was near the airport, but wasn't a creepy or dirty. The agent assured me the place was nice (I believe she was looking at the pictures of St. Tropez), and I paid $90. I have stayed in bad, dirty and &quot;cheap&quot; hotels before, but never one so dirty and gross, and I've never paid $90 to stay in a dive.The only positive thing I can say is it is close to the airport and they provide free transportation to and from the airport and into the city. I called to cancel the reservation after I found I could stay at Hooters for $99. However, the service put me on hold and then disconnected me. I could not reconnect despite many attempts. When I spoke with them later they said they had the wrong number for the hotel.The hotel said I could not cancel directly through them, since I had paid for the room through a 3rd party agent.I would not stay in this hotel, nor will I ever use the service that clearly does not know hotels."
6,380,"Oct 7 2007 	What a shambles !	We had just arrived from a 12hr flight from NZ. to L.A. Then wait 6hrs for our connection to Las Vegas. We arrived late evening, tired and just wanting to settle in and rest. It took over an hour to get from the airport to the hotel, as the shuttle driver could not find the Knights Inn(apparently we were given the wrong address!) Now this Hotel is only 6mins from the airport! So we go to check-in to be given no help with our bags and it was a fair way to to our room, only to find it was double booked! Now we have to carry and drag ourselves back to the registration office and they seem very discourteous and annoyed that they have to look for another room. Hospitality is very important when it comes to serving tourist who are either from overseas or inter-state visitors. Its only common to ask for help from the hotel about what services they have to offer, so why do they advertise when in fact it doesn't happen . We were terribly disappointed with how unhelpful they were in general about asking for simple questions about Las Vegas. eg Wheres the nearest shopping Mall? Do buses come pass the hotel? Wheres the nearest Post Office? etc. etc. We even heard complaints from other guests and saw one lady who checked-in one day and left the same day because she felt unsafe. With much regret I would not recommend this place to stay."
7,380,"Sep 18 2007 	Terrible	We stayed at the Knights Inn in Las Vegas for 2 nights. The room was very, very dirty. The popcorn ceiling was full of dust and stains. We didn't even had a trash in the room neither towels and we had to ask for. Then the second day we had to go back to the lobby beause the keys (card) were not working anymore and they had to give us new onces. Anyway, the room was pretty cheap but I would rather pay more than going back there. That's for sure."
8,380,"Aug 27 2007 	Worst Hotel!	Honestly, I've never stayed in a worse hotel. Customer service is obviously NOT in their vocabulary! Ok, problem one: in one of the rooms we were staying in had only one working light. We called the front desk to get it fixed and after a really long time the maintenance man finally came. The man's name was Poncho, he was honestly the BEST part of the hotel stay. He was awesome and got our problems fixed and every time we saw him around he made sure to tell us all a happy hello. OK back to the problems....BIG problem two: They conveniently neglected to inform us of their billing process which resulted in a credit card being put on lock and everyone in our party getting locked out of our rooms. When we called and confronted the manager about this she yelled and screamed at us and offered no help AT ALL, she even hung up on us. As soon as we were back to the hotel I went to the front desk to find out what could be done about the problem and they refused to offer us help, sympathy, or even acknowledgement that the problem had occurred because of the neglectful unprofessional girl who checked us in. As we were taking care of everything the people at the front desk gave us a LOT of attitude and even laughed at us. With much frustration we finally got the problems solved and back into our rooms. Problem three: One of the rooms we booked was for our newly wed friends. Each day at least twice the maid entered their rooms without any knock or other notice at all, she just walked in ready to clean! While we trying to figure out the billing problems we mentioned this and they hardly even acknowledged that either. Problem three: One of our friends had made an acquaintance with the lovely bartender on our last night. She was awesome and kept the bar open all night for us. We left the next day and the day after we left she called the phone number we had put on the account when booking the rooms looking for our other friend... how did she get this number you might ask? The front desk gave it to her!!! Can we say invasion of privacy?! I sure as hell can and I sure as hell will never stay at this piece of crap hotel again! Tell everyone you know! Lets get this place shut down! Everyone in the lobby that i talked to who was also a guest had the same opinion of the place. Not one person i talked to was even hardly satisfied."

10,380,"May 24 2007 	Heard gunshots upstairs!! do not stay here	please do not stay here, they just want your $$$ and they could not care less about your health and safety. I was going to stay for 3 days but left after the first night due to the gunfire on th 2nd level over my room. This is a good hourly hotel if you are onto that stuff. but for anything else, it should be torn down and rebuilt."
11,380,"May 11 2007 	Not safe	My husband and I took a quick weekend trip to Vegas with some friends. We knew the hotel wouldn't be the greatest since it was last minute. Upon arriving, the keys did not work in the door. Checked the number my husband was given and it did match. My husband went and got new keys. He then left with his buddy and I stayed in the room with our friend and her two daughters. We awoke to the door opening and it was not our husbands. It was somebody who had been given the key. He did not get a chance to try to explain because my friend had slammed the door and bolted it. We got a call from the front desk saying we were in the wrong room and I told them we were in the room assigned (I had already double checked). Turns out the room was put into the computer wrong. Still a scary experience. Our husbands came back and every time they tried to speak to a manager, was told one not available. They both said the front desk clerks were not very polite and never apologized for the mistake.The next day we took the shuttle to the strip. The shuttle driver was friendly but it did take him two trips to the airport before we were able to make it to th strip. He explained that airport passengers took priority.The room was clean but it did not make up for the experience. I prefer not having strangers trying to come into the room we had been told was the correct one. We will never stay here and can not recommend it-especially if you value safety."
12,380,"Apr 8 2007 	Horrible Service	My husband &amp; I took a spontaneous trip to Vegas in April 2007 - we knew the strip would be expensive, so we looked for hotels with free shuttle service to and from the airport and strip - and this is how we ran across the Knights Inn (formerly the Howard Johnson). The shuttle service from the airport was Excellent!! The driver was very friendly and knowledgeable - a pleasant experience. When we arrived at the hotel the check in process when fast (since we were the only ones there). When making our way to our room - it was very creepy!! the rooms were all outside in a courtyard setting with very little lighting (at which we were told later - the neighboring property shut down the day prior and shut off all the lighting that lit the hotel's parking area). Needless to say, I was very apprehensive about safety. The following day we waited until 10AM to take the first shuttle to the strip. We showed up very punctual and waited until 10:10 before asking the front desk when the bus will be there. We were told 'very shortly'. 15 minutes later - no bus. We asked again at 10:30 and we were told the same 'very shortly' - being patient we waited once again. At 10:40 the bus showed - but the driver refused to take us to the strip, stating that airport transportation was priority. Why do they have a schedule for the Strip if they do not follow it!!?? When alerting the desk that the bus will not take us, they told us that the manager will take us in her van 'very shortly' - so we waited once again. Needless to say, we waited for another 30 minutes before the manager was 'ready'. The front desk staff was very unfriendly, rude, and inconsiderate. They had no conception on time, stating numerous times 'very shortly' when it took 60-75 minutes. We will never be back!! Even though we only paid $40 for a night (and thank god we only stayed one night), we would rather spend double, triple, quandruple the price to stay on the strip!!"
13,380,"Apr 1 2007	Update on the airport Hojo 	I also went there with an open mindl THE HOJO AIRPORT (now the KNIGHTS INN). I had a chance to meet the owner and he's a great guy. Now you should know that the name has changed to KNIGHTS INN but has the same old phone number. The new owner just completed the revovation is wi-fi'd for your internet. the place had a cool simi NIGHT CLUB. 60&quot; tv, pool, slots and poker machines, oldies on the dial. 2 pools and one doesn't allow kids. My room was like new. th eowner told me that they just spent a lot of money to redo the &quot;rest&quot; of the roomsincluding the bar, restrauant and front desk..I had more fun in this bar than any of the big casions...good lucki left EVEN STEVE and that's good in Las Vegas"
14,380,"Nov 4 2006 	Be Wary	I read the reviews and went with an open mind. The price was very reasonable, it was not dirty and I did not notice noise from the airport. However, every day I told them we could get only one TV station and every day they said they would fix it. The faucet fell off in my hand. Contrary to the web site, there is no full service restaurant, just a snack bar where the same short order cook takes the money. Do not under any circumstances use the taxi phone in the lobby. I called five times and waited one hour and they never came. We had good luck with Desert Cab. It is tacky, but we kept reminding ourselves that the price was right and it was close to the Thomas &amp; Mack venue where we had our convention."
15,380,"Oct 7 2006 	Really Crappy Hotel	This hotel was very bad. Our check-in took a lot longer that it needed to be. In fact, I got into town at around midnight, and I was in my room by 2:00 AM. The front desk lady was not helpful at all, claiming that the computer was broken and/or I was not in the database. The lady did not offer me any apologies or discounts for this inconvenience. The management of this hotel is very unprofessional. This hotel is very rundown. The rooms are old, decorated in the cheesy 1970s Las Vegas style, and mold/mildew is everywhere. The bathrooms have threadbare towels and grime in between the tiles. No breakfast is offered. There is no airport shuttle. Next time I go to Las Vegas, I'll probably spend some more and stay somewhere else."
16,380,"Sep 16 2006	Good location 	This location is close to the airport and they must share rooms with the adjacent property, Knights Inn. We checked in at around 1:00 a.m. and the check-in was fast since we were the only guests in line. We sort of liked the location but the parking lot was a big-time crowded and room that we got was located at the Knights Inn, go-figure. The rate of &lt; $70 per night is great for Vegas although the room was dirty and the surrounding hotel area seemed scary but it might just have been my imagination. Fortunately, we only stayed here for one-night, got a great value and we slept well since the room on the 2nd floor was very quite, even in the morning."
17,380,"Sep 1 2006 	I'm Lovin it	Howard Johnson is the best hotel that I have ever stayed in Las Vegas. The staff is very friendly and the best par there is the O Club,the name of their bar. If you get a chance please go to the bar even if you are not staying at the hotel. They have two happy hours in one day and it is open 24 hours. Perfect location to and from the airport. A free courtesy shuttle to and from the airport that is extremely conenient. They are even very appreciative for the two dollar tip that I gave the driver, unlike many other Las Vegas hotels. See you again Howard Johnson Inn Airport Las Vegas."
18,380,"Sep 1 2006 	Horrible Scary Creepy	I had booked this online, can't remember if it was travelocity or connected to mapquest... I thought it was a standard chain, airport-business quality. I checked in, the lobby was creepy. I am a single woman, and there were men slinking about, I could feel them watching me, then looking away. The place is in the middle of a dumpy parking lot, the room was filthy and disgusting, warped bed, you could find better furniture at a dump. I was afraid of getting bugs or parasites from just going in, the carpet was so filthy. The main reason I left shortly after checking in (opting to lose my money), was that I felt so unsafe, I felt it would be too risky or dangerous to stay. Men were walking across the (disgusting patch of) grass, for no other reason I felt, than to eye me. I was exhausted from driving all night, had an important appointment in 30 minutes, and still decided to leave. I am a brave person with fortitude, but this place was too scary and I felt it would be dangerous to stay. This is personal-safety wise, the digusting dirty broken down room was enough to make my skin crawl. The desk attendant was rude and disgusting, with that kinda fake business like demeanor that you know is a thin cover for being totally gross. I did not stay there because I feared harm would come to me or I would disappear. Hope this helps. Howard Johnson... do yourself a favor and dump this property, it needs to be bulldozed. Unless, of course you want to keep it for the crack addicts or criminals. I will never even look at a Howard Johnson again."
19,380,"Aug 18 2006 	Served its purpose	Returning to Vegas after driving from LA , arrived at 11am and was told by very rude staff, who left us waiting while they were on what appeared to be a personal phone call that the room would not be ready until 3pm, left our luggage, returned hire car and decided to go on the strip. Returned back to the hotel 10pm and again the staff (different) were very unwelcoming, we were given the key to the left luggage to help ourselves (very secure!) a man did come out of the back office 'after' we had taken our cases and said that we shouldn't be in there on our own. Our room was in the Knights Motel as far away as you could get from the reception and on the first floor, we had three heavy cases and we had to carry them in the heat ourselves, I did ask the receptionist if there was anything nearer to which she just said NO! The room was extremely hot although there was air con which took about 20 minutes to kick in, the bedding was clean but one of the lights did not work, and the toilet was dirty Again the reception staff in the morning were totally unhelpful and gave the impression they were doing you a big favour just being there. I thought the Howard Johnson chain had a good name and booked for that reason but I wish I had read the reviews before we booked."
20,380,"Jul 22 2006 	A real Shocker	I guess I didn't do enough research about this property and I thought it would be OK. It was much too far away from the strip and the courtest shuttle was completely unreliable especially at night. The front desk people were the rudest in the hotel industry. Late one night the bath tap would not turn off and was running full force, the front desk person said there was no maintenance person on site so we should just close the bathroom door so that we wouldn't hear the water running!! The tap ran all night on full! You couldn't pay me to stay there again."
21,380,"Apr 16 2006	Fine for one night to crash if early airport departure	Booked for one night to be close to airport for 5.00am check-in. We stayed on a Friday night - USD49.99, cheapest we could get in Vegas for that day and it was close to the airport!We arrived at 9.30pm and were allocated a room at the adjoining sister property 'Knights Inn'.The room itself was tiny, with thin walls as mentioned by other reviewers. However, on the plus side the sheets were clean, as was the bathroom (everything in working order with towels).Because we were at the Knights Inn there were no tea/coffee facilities. However, there was a working telephone, small tv and a fridge and microwave. Wake-up call booked via the automatic service on the phone worked well, with a follow-up call (also automatic) made 5 minutes later.Stay there again? Only as a last resort, but if you have to, for one night, it's fine.Shuttle to airport worked fine."
22,380,"Apr 11 2006	OK place to crash for one night	Yes, I read the reviews and booked it anyway. We were flying in late one night to be off again in the early AM, and this was close to the airport and cheap. Would I stay here again? Doubtful. The place was a bit weird. It's at least 2 motels and several buildings in a confusing complex. All the lights operated off one switch that was on the back wall, 6 feet off the floor. Was it clean? Never saw it in good light. Was it noisy? No. Did I feel safe? Yes, with my husband there. If you were just catching some sleep before going somewhere else, I give it just barely an OK. This is not the place to spend your Las Vegas vacation."
23,380,"Apr 3 2006	The dirtiest motel/hotel I have ever stayed in	This motel is the dirtiest that we have ever stayed at. Room service was abysmal and the manager that I spoke to couldn't care less about the guests. We stayed two nights (too long). The first night we had insufficient facecloths and towels (we didn't discover this until the morning). The room was not serviced until almost 10pm despite my complaining to the manager at 4pm and 6pm. At 6pm he stated that he did not know whether the bed would be made for that night. The carpet was very dirty and stained. The so-called restaurant closed around 3pm, the menu was very limited, and the food was served on thin disposable plates and the cutlery was of the the cheap plastic kind."
24,380,"Mar 23 2006	""Kightmare Inn""/(knight's Inn/part of Howard Johnson's)	I wrote this letter to &quot;travelworm&quot; who I booked through.I am writing this letter to complain of a hotel I stayed at last week in Las Vegas. I feel I deserve some type of credit for the disgusting hotel I stayed at. I had lost the paperwork for your number when I arrived at Vegas so was unable to call you.Prior to my arrival going to Vegas, I went online and read horrible reviews about the Howard Johnson's Inn by the airport in Vegas and contacted a travelworm rep(man) to try and cancel my reservation 2 nights prior to my arrival. He stated to me&quot; oh, I always get requests to stay at the Howard johnson's. I said &quot; ok, i will get it a try&quot;. Big mistake!I was taken to another hotel called the &quot;knights Inn&quot;. they told me they were now a part of HJ's. They were not sure they had room for me and a non-smoking room at that. They could see I was getting upset. Well my room had a wonderful view of a cement wall. The paper thin walls make it possible to hear people talking and moving above me and next to me for most of the day and night. The clock was unplugged, no outlet available except across the room. The shower had no hot water. The door was so warped, I could see the light coming into the room. I had to run the filthy fan all night to drown out the noise level. I was so worried about getting sick or some kind of germ, I slept in my clothes."
25,380,"Mar 19 2006	Hmmmmmmm listen to the reviews	Yes I read the reviews and everyting seemed to be over $200 per night due to Nascar weekend. I went with the hotel as a few said it was clean. Our room was smaller than my kitchen, dark, leaky bath tub, and the cable wires were ripped out of the wall. We put towels over the pillows just in case, although the sheets and such looked clean. I would NOT stay here again it is off the beaten path and the people at the front desk are rude and suck. We were told when I booked, when we arrived, and the morning we checked out that the FREE shuttle service to the strip started at 9am. Of course we were ready the shuttle sitting out front but it doesn't run during the day on weekends. LOL I about died. Took a cab to our strip hotel and were VERYT VERY happy with the Imperial Palace and it's great location."
26,380,"Mar 13 2006	Unsafe dirty and plumb scary	I am a lady in my 60's traveling alone. I thought a Howard Johnson should be okay. Not so! I was sent to a room way on the other side of the motel from the lobby. It was dirty, no towels except for a used one on the back of the bathroom door. The door was flimsy and had just the chain and regular lock. No deadbolt. I went to a show on the Strip and when I returned, the lighting was almost non-existent. I decided after getting to the room to take a shower, but all I could get was scalding hot water. No amount of adjusting would work. (I had finally received clean towels). I piled all my luggage and a chair in front of the door and tried to sleep! They charged me for the room and I had already paid Priceline. That is being straightened out now.I had planned on staying there on my return from CA, but contacted Priceline and cancelled. I was too apprehensive to ever stay there again."
27,380,Mar 12 2006	What a Dump!	This is the worst place I have ever stayed at in my life! Took over an hour and 1/2 to check in and there were only 10 people ahead of me. The room was okay but dark. TV didn't work. Thank goodness we only had to stay here the night before our flight. We stayed at the Luxor at the beginning of our vacation and then traveled to Arizona and Utah before returning to Vegas to fly home. Next time I will stay on the strip before heading home. This hotel was not worth it. Couldn't pay me to stay here again!
28,380,"Feb 27 2006	Never again. What a dump!!!	We stayed here for 2 days until we could check into the Tropicana. Couldn't wait to leave and everyone else leaving that day had equal horror stories. Rooms were not clean, the door wouldn't close unless slammed hard because the frame was loose, it took 2 days to get a trash can delivered and had to take an ashtray from the bar. No bathmat, only 1 towel and 1 washcloth for 2 people. The &quot;coffee shop&quot; was a room with rocky tables, some vending machines, and a coffee urn that rarely worked. There was a window where one can order food and the cook was excellent. Shuttle drivers were friendly and helpful, but front desk people were rude and seemed to care less. Howard Johnson used to be a quality motel, but this one is a nightmare. Will never stay there again."
29,380,"Feb 24 2006	!! Don't stay here!!	I didn't read the reviews before I booked; big mistake. We checked into the Howard Johnson Airport Hotel at 1 am. The toilet was plugged and brimful of crap. There were no towels or washcloths in the room. There was dirt and a huge hairball on the floor. They unclogged the toilet at 8 in the morning and we fetched towels from the lobby. I asked for a refund but was told to talk to the manager. When we had a repeat of no towels the next morning we were told they were OUT! of towels. We went to the lobby and asked there and they gave us some big hand towels to bathe with. We decided to move to another hotel even though we had one more night reserved. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate and talk to the manager, we left without being able to get our third night refunded. The third-party reservation agent was very helpful, but did not refund any money. This hotel is not a bargain at ANY price!"
30,380,"Feb 13 2006	one word... ick	I will begin by saying that my Mom and I are not picky when it comes to hotels. We have stayed in some pretty questionable places and not complained. We were only staying one night after my Mom picking me up at the airport late (we wanted to shop the next day before making the drive back to her home in Utah). All we ask is that a hotel room be clean, well stocked with towels and not smell like an armpit...pretty low expectations I'd think. This room failed on all counts. It was dirty (that ground-in old kind of dirty), VERY small, not one towel in the room...not even a washcloth (we did not notice this until it was late at night), one small soap and no closet, blow drier or iron, no remote for the TV. We called the front desk to have 2 extra pillows brought in that night and none came. In the morning we called for towels but no one ever answered the phone at the front desk after 3 tries. My Mom walked to the office and was told they didn't have any towels. She found a maintenance woman on the way back to the room and asked her for some towels from her cart and when she got back to the room she noticed that she had ONE towel and ONE washcloth. That's it. The sheets were clean but the bedspreads were musty and dirty. The shower was lukewarm at best after trying every setting on the water dial. The apartments at the back of the hotel property are scary and we made sure not to go out after dark. I'm sure you can do better at just about any hotel in Vegas because I'm certain you can't do much worse. This hotel was definitely a room-by-the-hour type place. The only remotely good thing I can say was that they took $10 off the room price after my Mom complained at check out, but even that was an ordeal of rudenss and &quot;I'll have to talk to the manager&quot; which took a LONG time."
31,380,"Feb 2 2006	If you value your life stay away from this hotel!	Here are just a few examples of how bad this place was.1. The shuttle was an hour late picking us up and the drive was 5-10 minutes from the airport to the hotel. The passenger side door was broken and did not shut properly.2. Once we arrived I couldn't believe my eyes. I have been in ghettos in most of the major cities in the U.S. and I felt safer in the ghettos.3. After hauling our luggage from the Check-In to our room on the other side of the property around midnight we opened our door to h.e. double hockey sticks if you know what I mean. It was so bad I didn't want to take my shoes off!4. I slept (attempted to sleep) with my clothes on and laying on top of the covers on a mattress that sunk in the middle.5. Again, I would like to stress how unsafe I felt. Our door had one lock and that wasn't enough and to top it off the seal around the door was non-existent so I'm sure bugs of all kinds enjoy checking into the roach motel.6. When I finally fell asleep I was woken up to several ladies of the night discussing their business ventures for the evening. The walls were so thin I could actually hear them light their cigarettes and cracking their beverage of choice open.7. In the morning I chose not to take a shower because I felt that I would be cleaner in my own dirt until we made it to our destination in Utah.We simply wanted a clean and safe place to stay near the airport in order to pick up our rental car first thing in the morning and drive to Utah to start our honeymoon trip. We were so relieved that we chose another hotel in Las Vegas on the strip to stay in for the last 3 days of our honeymoon. If I had to do it all over again we would have fallen asleep on chairs at the airport and waited for a few hours before picking up our rental car and risk being arrested. A jail cell would have been cleaner and safer. Do not stay in this hotel if value your life and health."
32,380,"Jan 18 2006	Please Stay Away!!!!	We just decided to take a last second trip to Vega, and called Travel Worm, my wife who graduated with a BA in Hotel Restaurant Management, asked all of the right questions. Is the hotel safe, is it kid friendly, and does it have amenities for children? Well that was far from the truth, the hotel had broken key card locks, the second room was used for one purpose (if you know what I mean), the third was better, but I would not let my family take a shower there. I called travel worm, but they were closed and we needed a place to stay. The next morning we called, and got a representative who was trying to get us a refund, and put us up in the Texas Station Hotel, and casino. Well her manager wanted to do nothing with that, so when we felt safety issues, she stated well you are not in the hospital, so it must be safe All I can tell you is to avoid this hotel, avoid travelworm. It was the worst experience ever, and we are trying to get a refund, but we did learn a good lesson, and I hope you dont get caught like we did."
33,380,"Dec 27 2005	Avoid this place like plague	This is the worst hotel I ever stayed in my life and it has the worst service. Go stay anywhere else in Vegas but here. You will get much better deals in Vegas at the same price. I stayed here during this xmas weekend and I could not stay here more than a nite. Here is what I have experienced in this hell:1.No TV (it is there but no reception at all).2. No Phone (well, it is there too, but it is dead)3.Better bring your own sheets and blankets4. About a century old tub5. Keep your shoes on, the carpet is so dirty and smelly6. Do not expect any courtesy or any help from the front desk"
34,380,Dec 7 2005	Clean Motel @ decent location	Rooms were pretty good and satisfied with the service as well.
35,380,"Nov 15 2005	pleasantly surprised	We made reservations before we saw the reviews, I laughed so hard I cried. But when we got there, it was great. We must have gotten a remodeled room. Bring your own soft towels from home and you will be fine. Don't go there wanting a 5 star hotel experience. The fridge and microwave helped us save money on food. New rugs,new bathrooms, cable TV, the whole nine yards. We had a great time."
36,380,"Nov 3 2005	Lets disucss this one!	Well, the room was nice, clean and cheap. BUT we had a few problems...we were in the handicapped room, and people kept parking in our spot, so we had to keep calling the desk. There were water bugs in the bathroom. The shuttle service to and from the airport was fantastic and the driver was great. He even recommended a good place for prime rib at a cheap price! (San Remo's Hotel - $5.95) Remember to record your OWN telephone message though when u arrive at the hotel. Otherwise, your callers MIGHT not think they have called the right room, as in our case for most of the week! haha I liked staying *off the strip* though. Good location and nooooooo the planes can't be heard in the room...however....the walls are thin between rooms...haha Happy Traveling!"
37,380,"Oct 28 2005	Would'nt even give it one Bubble but have to!!!	This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I am a pretty easy person to please. We stayed there six nights. We had too due to a dog show and no other hotels would take us with dogs. The rooms were durty. The first night of the six nights they cleaned it. The other five nights they didn't, even though we asked them to every night. The manager ended up calling me a lier. They don't ever answer there phones. They don't know what is going on in that place. Not just because I might have had a bad experice I give it a 0 on a 1-10. What ever you do don't stay here!!! Every one else with the dog show agreed that the hotel was horrible and had the same problems."
38,380,Oct 15 2005	Dont Stay!!!! Please!!!	This is the worst motel I've ever stayed.Worst service ever.No towels in my room.I phoned the housekeeping a thousand times.they just asked my room no.but never came to give towels.The staff are not accomodating.the exterior and interior of this motel looks dirty.TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! wish they would close.DONT BOOK PLEASE!!! you will regret.FILTHY!!
39,380,"Oct 4 2005	Just the Rate	Front desk service was deplorable...only one person on. Had to wait in linefor over 15 minutes. Rooms very sparse...2 small pillows on a king size bed, only 2 towels, no hairdryer.Shuttle service to and from the strip was limited. Times provided for pick up at hotel,strip or airport depatures were doubtful. Only one shuttle van ... overcrowded every time we took it. The restaraunt was limited---reminded me of a McDonald's! Would not stay there again."
40,380,"Sep 5 2005	dirty old worn-out	I read your reviews and worried. thought it could not really be that bad -but it was. The first rooms we were shown were unmade and smokey although our booking was non-smoking, we were then given non-smoking rooms but they were filthy- cobwebs and stained sheets and filthy stained carpet, the bath had lost its enamel and even the toilet flush broke.We were booked for a second night in king bed sized rooms as the children were flying home,but they could not provide these as they had lost one booking and the other was in a smoking room.The shuttle to the airport and strip were good. The pool was nice -we sat here when we could not be offsite.The area at the back of the hotel was scary-we did not feel safe."
41,380,"Sep 1 2005	Very scary...	I'm a frequent visitor to Vegas (only a 4 hour drive) and I have to say this is the WORST room I have ever been in. The first room we were given did not have a door knob. The second room was across from a pile of dirty matresses in the parking lot, and I may have been better off sleeping out there. There was mold in the bathtub and the warm water in the shower lasted about 2 minutes (this was early afternoon on a Saturday). Also some crusty stuff on the shower curtain, I can't describe as I tried not to look. The only saving grace was the young guy who drove the shuttle late at night. He gave us his cell number as the shuttle doesn't really have set times and we waited a while to get on and go to the strip. He picked us up much later than the times given."
42,380,"Aug 22 2005 	The Remodeled Rooms Are Great !!!!	when i read the other reviews a freaked out but it was the day we were leaving and too late to change plans so we decided to just go for it and prepare for the worst.... was i ever suprised we had a good time the price was as low as you can get in vegas 44.00 a night we slept in a newly remodeled room, quiet, clean microwave and fridge and air conditioner all in good shape new bed, new dresser, the pool was alot of fun, the bar was great!!! not at all smoky we even sat down in the lounge area and watched a movie and the pizza in the deli really hit the spot I would stay here again but only in one of the newer rooms in the 100 building and the staff were very nice to us we had a great time !!!! the remodel is about half done so we will go back for sure"
43,380,"Aug 21 2005	Avoid the Las Vegas Airport Howard Johnson	When we arrived at our room there were no towls. After a call to the front desk it took an unacceptably long time to receive our towls. The hotel staff seemed unresponsive and uncaring about their mistake. I had booked the room through Orbitz and was charged on my credit card by Orbitz. After we left another charge from the motel showed up, in effect we were billed once by Orbitz and once by the hotel for the room. The hotel manager has yet to return my call to correct the overcharge."
44,380,"Aug 20 2005	this hojo is a no-no	what a digusting place, we needed a place to stay on saturday night, being that the room was only 53.99 we took it. i went ahead and guarenteed so we would have a place to stay when we came in that night. what a mistake... i thought for sure gil grissom and his csi crew would be showing up at anytime to investigate. i thought for sure someone or something had died there. the walls were dirty and grimey looked liked someone wiped their nose pickings on the wall. there was no waste basket, no coffee maker, no cups, maybe two towels. the bathtub was dirty, looked like soap scum build up for the last 20 years, the mold and mildew were a nice touch too. the furniture had caked on grime. i think the board of health would condem this place. please think twice before staying, i wished i would have spend the extra money for another room somewhere else"
45,380,"Aug 2 2005	Worst hotel!!!Warning!!!	It was our first time at Las Vegas, so we decided to pick a cheap hotel to stay. Worst ever!!Dirty rooms, uncomfortable beds, dirty floors, dirty bathrooms.Very far from the strip, so you have to rent a car to be able go to the strip. There is no casino in the hotel. Do not even think on choosing this hotel."
46,380,"May 24 2005	The maybe shuttle	So, we could save some money by staying out near the airport at the Howard Johnsons ... it was sure to be a bit ... um ... cheapish. But we could handle that since we would only be sleeping there anyway but ... how would we deal with the coming and going when we want to go to the Strip or Downtown? OH, no problem ... the people on the phone said that they have a free shuttle out at the Howard Johnsons that takes you to the Strip or to the Airport. They said that it runs regularly throughout the day. Perfect! We booked the room and went on vacation to Vegas. It took a while and from the airport it was necessary to call them and wait but hey ... it isn't far. Actually, I have no complaints about the shuttle service to and from the airport. They only have one van but they will interrupt other plans to do an airport run for any of the guests at the two hotels that that shuttle serves (especially the crews of one of the airlines who all stay at the other hotel).And there's the rub. They tell you that the shuttle will drive you to the Tropicana Hotel on the Strip every hour on the hour and they will pick you up from the Tropicana soon after the hour (the exact time depending on traffic). Fair enough ... it's only one spot on the Strip instead of what I had assumed when I left home but still, they get you to the Strip as advertised. But wait! There is only one van and they serve two hotels and ANY call to the airport will cause them to suspend the scheduled run to the the Tropicana. So, there you are at the Tropicana waiting for your ride to the hotel so you can catch some sleep but ... the van doesn't come and it doesn't come and ... it doesn't come (hours sometimes). You use your cell phone to call and there is always and only one response from the hotel and it is probably true -- they are doing a run to the airport. In fact, it is not unreasonable to think that they are doing six or seven different runs to and from the airport before they next get a chance to go back to the Tropicana run. And when they do come ...there are 25 people waiting for that van that seats 12 so you'll have to wait till the next run but there may be airport runs between now and the return. Time to go find a taxi (don't try calling one in Vegas, they take a very long time ... go to one of the bigger hotels where the taxis come to line up to take riders. It'll cost maybe $7 to get back to your cheap hotel out by the airport. Don't you wish that you called that $7 taxi before you waited for 2 hours and THEN called?I hope your plan was not to just run back to the hotel to change clothes and go out again ... because the shuttle is doing an airport run ... or two. Have a nice weekend."
47,380,"May 19 2005	Worst motel ever.	All I needed was a cheap and clean bed near the airport to rest during an extra long flight delay....I figured Howard Johnsons would fit the bill.The exterior of the motel is in serious disrepair, however they might be renovating because there were piles of used bathtubs and sinks in the parking lot. As bad as the exterior was, the interior of the room was worse. The tub was CRACKED and moldy, the sink handle was broken, and the security lock was broken. Plus the whole room was dirty and sour smelling. There didn't seem to be a lack of housekeeping staff, either. I was disturbed several times during the night by laundry carts rattling by my room.Why did I stay? At the time I'd been awake for almost 36 hours and I couldn't think straight. The bed appeared clean with crisp (although worn and frayed) sheets, and the need for sleep was stronger than my need to use the shower or sink. Which is just as well, because there were no bath towels in the room.When I checked out, I gave the desk clerk a list of the problems with the room. His response? &quot;Good!&quot; No apology, no offer to make things right, just &quot;Good&quot;.Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to take photos, which I will be sending to the President, Mr. Ken Greene (1 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054) along with a request for a full refund.My advice is to stay away from this property."
48,380,"May 16 2005	Run Away! Run Away!	We never actually stayed at this hotel, and boy, after reading the other reviews, are we ever glad we didn't! Before we knew about the reviews available on this web site, we actually tried to book a room at this hotel and we found out, without even finishing the process, that this hotel is a loser. My wife dialed the 800 number and was told by that person that they couldn't book us and we'd have to call long distance. So, she did. After being put on hold for several minutes, when the employee got back on the phone my wife told her it was a long distance call so, you know what the employee did? She put my wife on hold again and NEVER GOT BACK ON. After 10 minutes, my wife hung up and sent a scathing email to HOJO. Which also precipitated this review by yours truly. Save yourself some grief and look elsewhere...there are plenty of other places that actually want your business."
49,380,"May 16 2005	Nasteee!!	I will echo the previous reviews warning future travelers to stay away from this one! I did read the reviews prior to staying there, but, thought it wouldn't be so bad for only one night. We should have forked over some more bucks to stay at a better place. The room was gross and dirty--the bathroom floor and shower were a nightmare and the clientele left much to be desired, to put it mildly! We are not hotel snobs and have stayed in marginal places before, but at least they were clean! Be afraid....be very afraid!!"
50,380,"May 6 2005	Avoid this hotel at all costs	This is a hotel from the third world. Should have known from the number of screaming (literally) guests at the front desk not to stay, but we were already booked as a package deal. Now cheap has to be expected to be a bit underpar, but not to the point of... never any towels in the rooms and having to walk a fair distance to the front desk in order to get some when reported as missing(&quot;come and get them&quot;,) no water for flushing, showering, or anything for five-7 hours one day, surly cigarette smoking maintenance man in non-smoking room, lewd messages that couldn't be deleted from telephone which constantly rang that there were messages to be picked up, also lewd &quot;hey baby,,, etc. etc.&quot; answer message to incoming calls that could really have upset the husband - (nobody in the hotel seemed at all interested in taking care of this,) disconnected fire alarm that didn't work once the aforesaid surly maintenance man reconnected it and wasn't corrected from there on. The &quot;restaurant&quot; was more of a cafe and the workers did their best, but the smell of tobacco smoke from the bar through the open door overwhelmed the taste of any food! Yep third world, but with none of the presumed charm that might be possible, just outstandingly third, no fifth rate! Avoid this hotel at all costs"
51,380,"May 5 2005	Don't ruin your trip!	I am so sorry to say that this place was extremely frustrating and disappointing to stay at. We had a group of 10 woman and five rooms for 5 nights so I feel we gave the place plenty of time to show us what they had to offer and how they respond to their clientle's needs, wishes, complaints. From the moment we checked in there was confusion and problems and it continued the whole five days. Everything from disconnected fire alarms, phones that would not work, no coffee pot and microwave as advertised, no towels, no room service til 6:00 pm, no water one whole afternoon, the floors were dirty and the tub often not cleaned up. The front desk would often not answer the phone or if they did would put us on hold and this is probably because they were having so many complaints as demonstrated repeatedly in the front lobby where irrate customers where venting there complaints. Where the management was through all this was often a mystery and the poor hired help seemed either at wits end or were just plain rude to us. Do yourself a big favor and stay somewhere else."
52,380,"May 3 2005	This place is not worth the money!	It took forever for hotel staff to check people in, I had to wait at least 20 minutes before reaching the counter (and there were only 2 customers at the counter). The room had an off odor, the bathroom was barely clean, carpeting and curtains were worn out. The room was missing the TV's remote control. I called the office, they said they would notify Maintenance. After 1 hour I walked down to the lobby to get a remote, but the clerk stated that said she would notify Maintenance for me (apparently Maint. has the remotes). An hour later I asked a hotel maid I ran into in the corridor how do I get a remote, she didn't know. I gave up on the remote but did ask the maid for a ice bucket and cups, since the room had neither. She didn't have any more ice buckets and offered me a plastic baggie instead for the ice machine. She did have plastic glass cups however. This place is a dump, period. I will read the reviews first, before booking. And nope, no one ever brought me a remote control."
53,380,"Apr 30 2005	good bargain for price	I read others reviews after I made my reservation and was a bit scared, but realized that for $30.00 I was going to get a place to sleep. I arrived early but was not allowed to check in till 3pm. The King/Smoking room I reserved never became available so I took a double. Rooms are small, but overall was clean. One towel rack was busted and lying in the bathroom. There were no towels or alarm clock and it took three requests to get them. I used the pool which was pleasant and spent some time playing the poker machines with $1 taps of beer. My wake up call came on time and I had a quiet nites sleep (Sunday). The free airport shuttle had me there in 5 minutes. The main reason I stayed here was to be close to the airport and needed a free shuttle to cut costs. Overall, for 30.00 bucks it was a bargain and I would stay again in the same situation. People need to realize that for 30.00 bucks your not going to get the things you do for 50.00, 80.00 or more. Budget Travel Magazine take note."
54,380,"Apr 20 2005	Good enough for one night	We slept one night at HoJo Las Vegas Airport in April. Price is good, that's why we chose that hotel. Check-in was slow but friendly, and the room was typical motel-decoration. Tv worked well as well as the showers. Breakfast wasn't included. Location is really near the airport. However, there wasn't much noise so we slept quite well."
55,380,"Apr 8 2005	Pretty rough	You get what you pay for.....we paid 50 dollars for one night. We needed a cheap hotel for the last night of our trip.Reception was unbearably full of cigarette smoke, staff were friendly on check in.Door of room didn't lock properly, bit unnerving as I was without hubby that night!On check out and request for free airport shuttle, bloke on the desk was not all there I would say. But the shuttle arrived within 10 mins and the driver was very courteous.Can't say I felt particularly safe there. But I'm sure there are even worse places in that price range."
56,380,"Apr 6 2005	Plain thieves	If anyone going to Vegas is considering staying at this hotel, please don't. I am from Switzerland and was traveling all over the US. I made a reservation for this hotel through a website and was charged twice. First, by the website, then by the hotel. When I called to have the payment refunded, they wouldn't get the manager, put me on hold or transfer me to a voice mailbox. This lasted for over two weeks, until I had to tell my bank to reject payment, which took 45 days. To put it in simple words, these people are plain THIEVES. The quality of the hotel is minimal."
57,380,"Mar 29 2005	Not Worth the Price Even to Store Luggage!	A few friends and I rented a room here our last night in Vegas. We left another hotel and came here to save money (since it was a Friday night) and a place to store our luggage. We assumed we'd be out most of the night, and had an early flight. The room was small, which wasn't a concern of ours at the time. The shuttle to and from the Tropicana is worthless! We waited 45 min. for the shuttle to arrive and it never did, so we took a cab. The second time we gambled on the shuttle it was again 45 min. late. The shuttle to the airport is nice, and we didn't have to wait on that. There was no soap and no towels in the hotel. When we called the front desk to inquire we were placed on hold for 10 minutes and nobody ever answered. I am without a doubt a low maintenance traveler, but this place was horrible!"
58,380,Mar 15 2005	One star hotel. Period.
59,380,Feb 15 2005	This place is not worth $20 dollars

1,381,"Jun 12 2009 	Cheap and poorly maintained	Whilst the hotel was located close to the airport and is very cheap it was also somewhat shabby with some poor fixtures and fittings including noisy and uneffective air-conditioning. The bedroom was however spacious and the bed comfy, and we were given a free ride to the airport."
2,381,"Jun 3 2009 	Dishonest and unprepared for their guests	My husband, sister-in-law and I reserved a room together but had to drive around the hugecuty block several times before we were able to locate the entrance. They have two lobbies but only use the one in the back that is difficult to locate/find, there are no signs indicating that there is a second loby either.When we got to our room that we had reserved in advance we discovered two small towels were ready for us three adults. They never did bring us a third towel during the entire 3 day stay. My sister-in-law lost $700 from her purse while there as well.We will definately never return for the price was the same as the fancy places in the area we discovered!!! Complete rip off!"
3,381,"Dec 1 2008 	Horrifying! Stay away! Shut this place down!	My boyfriend and I stayed there during the week of a convention. We had stayed there last year and it was okay. I now know this is because last year when we stayed there they had just bought the property from Howard Johnsons and hadn't turned it to crap yet. This time around though it was horrifying. On other occasions we have slummed it to save money but had I known the hotel had deteriorated this much in a year I would not have had a problem paying for a strip hotel or a courtyard marriott. I was two steps from sleeping in my car. I know you're thinking why did we stay - well convention week, all hotels booked, cheapest rooms were about 400 a night - I did not have $2000 handy. We stayed out as much as possible and everyday when we came back I swore we would not find our luggage in the room. It was evident the cleaning service was helping themselves to my cream and perfume. I would leave them face down in my toiletry bag and when I came back at night find them face up with the caps open. The place was deserted and when we requested to stay in a suite (which we had last year and it was nice) they said they were booked to capacity and that the suite would cost $300! Freakin liars and thieves! The hotel had NO ONE staying there - pretty obvious by the lack of um people? and um 3 cars including ours in the parking lot. When we drove to the room we passed by rooms that were obviously getting treated for pestilence. Thank goodness I brought flip flops - I never took them off in the room and showered with them. The towels were filthy with all kinds of colorful spots on them. At night every time I would hear a car sound I thought ours was getting stolen. There were no tissues in the room and the TVs seemed as though they had been bought in a garage sale and looked exactly like I had in my bedroom when I was 8 - really small and with horrible picture. We wrapped the remote with toilet paper to avoid touching it. Our first night there also a huge chunk of the AC just fell off. Some of these things are trivial yes , but I am just trying to paint the overall picture to you.And last but definitely not least! They tried to charge me a different rate. I noticed when I went to check in and demanded they change it. They said they had already put a hold on my credit card but not to worry when I checked out they would charge me the right price. When I checked out they tried to charge me for the amount they had held and they said oh sorry we accidentally deleted your reservation and can't see what price you booked - well not to worry I said because I have a printed confirmation of my booking. I told them if they tried to argue it I would call the bank and tell them it's a fraudulent charge - that's when they stopped arguing.PLEASE DON'T EVEN GO NEAR THERE!!! THEY MUST BE VIOLATING SOOOO MANY HEALTH CODES AND NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN!!"
4,381,"Nov 10 2008 	Please please read for your safety	I had high hopes for this hotel just by looking at the outside, but what do people say dont judge a book by its cover. When i arrived i went to the front office and told them i would like to check in and they looked at me like i wasnt even at a hotel anyway after i got my key we searched for atleast 30 minutes looking for a parking spot that was close enough to my room so i could atleast keep an eye on it because there was absolutly no lighting. We got in our room and i jumped on the bed and thought i had just busted my teeth out it was so hard. But we decided to stay cause we were already there and we needed the money to do everything else we wanted to do that weekend. That night when we climbed into bed my friend kept complaining that his bed smelt like throw up so i told him go tell the front desk to get you new sheets so he did suprise surprise suprise they never showed up to change the sheets. The next night we decided to sit down and watch some t.v. but when we looked at the t.v. we had no idea how to work it it looked like it was from the 1970's and had the numbers along the dial if that makes sense we couldnt find the remote anywhere so just eventually gave up. It also says that there is wireless internet that your lap tops can connect into after you pay a small fee. I couldnt figure it out so went to the front desk to get some direction and they no kidding told me they didnt know what i was talking about. The next morning we decided to go swimming BAD IDEA. so many bugs and twigs and leaves and stains i almost through up NO LIE i would rather swim in my toilet at home. At to top it off there continental breakfast the ethiopians wouldnt even eat you think i am blowing this out of porportion maybe you shouldnt listen to all these reviews and find out for yourself would sleep in my car before ever sleeping here again."
5,381,"Aug 10 2008 	Room OK I would not bring any kids here	I stayed in Jan 2008 as an attendee of the The Home Entertainment Show (an &quot;offshoot&quot; of CES). I have never been to this hotel and, although I can afford better, I really wanted a bargain since I planned to be out and about during most of my stay. I booked this hotel through it's internet website and was clearly foolded by the photos which cast an artificially pleasent light on the hotel which was rundown. As an adult male traveling alone and using the room only as a place to sleep and shower, I found the accomodations just barely OK. I have stayed in many differnt kinds of hotels, from 5 star luxury resorts to Super 8 and Motel 6. They all have their plusses and minuses. The pro's: it is dirt cheap and close to the airport. The doors lock. The heater worked (even too well) as did the TV. The hot water was hot, the toilet flushed and towels/soap were available. You can buy beer in the bar attached to the lobby and drag it to the room to help alleviate all the con's you are constantly aware of below. The con's: Sometimes, you get what you pay for. It was difficult to find since it has two entrances fromon two main one way streets. The lobby was rundown and dirty (but adequate). The desk clerks were sufficient to check you in and check you out but did seem disinterested. There is a self pay via vending machine breakfast which I never utilized. Walking into the room, I immediately felt like I was in a cheap room. My room was a bit dingy and a bit gross (reasonably clean comensurate with the price of the room). There were some light stains in the bathroom porcelin. No internet but a small cubby to work on a PC, etc. I always travel with a tiny febreeze to help with the smells which were tolerable in my room. The bedspread felt gross(good thing I didn't have a black light). There were people hanging around at all hours...some of them appeared pretty shady (although I am well aware one cannot judge a book by it's cover...there were some pretty &quot;rattily covered books&quot; around this place). I would be uncomfortable leaving my wife there alone and I would never consider bringing my children here unless I was desperate for a place to sleep for one night and had no alternatives. I always left my curtains closed to eliminate the possibility of some looking into my room and seeing my camera, laptop, etc. The closest ice maker was broken and the next closest one was quite a ways away...and there were a few nights when I met some creepy glares and stares while I was getting ice. Outside noise was easily heard...fortunately, I am a heavy sleeper but I am sure the rooms have the potential to be intolerably noisey depending largely on who else is staying at the hotel. Truth be told, the last time I stayed at a Motel 6, the noise of screeming, running children was much worse than the noise I experienced here. I stepped out of my room early one morning to find beer bottles strewn all around and on my extereior windowsill. I stayed in an upper level room on the side of the hotel far opposite from the side where the front desk is located. At night, walking to the lobby felt like walking through seedier parts of Hollywood...and it was a bit of a walk since the hotel is so elongated and there was no straight shot to the lobby....you would have to walk through the potholed parking lot (which was desperately in need of resurfacing), then inside around dark corridors and then along the outside perimeter past everyone loitering and...well, you get the picture. The upper level sidewalks leading to the rooms were cracked, uneven and clearly rundown. If you are a single adult male (or a group of adults), not planning on a long stay, don't want to spend money and plan to spend your nights and days wondering all over the Strip (or wherever) and aren't bothered by a few shady characters, the hotel will suffice. If you want a place off the strip and near the airport, this will work too. If you want to feel comfortable and relaxed, there will be better offerings elsewhere, especially if you want to bring your family."
6,381,"Jul 7 2008 	Dangerous. Stay away.	I booked a room for one night on the Fourth of July through travelworm.com. Once I arrived, I pretty much instantly decided there was no way in heck that I was going to stay there, in the interest of my personal safety. The unlit parking lot with many many disreputable-looking people watching my every move would have been enough to convince me. If not, the police activity would have done so. Stay away from this place."
7,381,"Apr 6 2008 	price might be right but don't stay here.	I should have listen to the other reviews that I read. I didn't and soon found out myself what they were talking about. We arrived into vegas late and were tired from the travelling and the time difference. Got our car and then found the hotel and were happy that it was close. That was until I went into the lobby. I could tell right away that they place was old and tired, and needs a face lift. The staff at the counter were not pleasant and gave the impression that they didn't really want to help or even be there. I kept telling myself that it was only for one night. But really that should not have mattered. So got our key and were told where to find the room. After driving around the building four times and fighting with my hubby we both finally realized that the room was not going to be on the exterior of the units but was down a lane way and we had to park and walk to our door. OK...so everyone has to walk to the door, but we expected to find the room facing the parking lot. At least that was the impression that I was given. Once in the room the it was even more tired. It was clean but old and smelly. The walls were paper thin, and you could hear every foot step from above you. The remote for the tv was missing and I was concerned that they would think that I took that I made a point of going back to tell the office that it wasn't there. Needless to say I didn't really have a good nights rest. I have stayed in many places in Las Vegas and this was the worst place that I have ever stayed in. I will never stay here again, and strongly recommend that no one else stay there. I don't usually write reviews but I couldn't let this pass without warning others that might think that it s a good place to stay. DO NOT STAY HERE."
8,381,"Mar 18 2008 	Do Not Stay Here! Great Location or Not!	This place was terrifying! We stayed here for our last night because it was so near to the airport and we had a very early flight! It wasn't worth it! I'd pay twice as much as we did to have a decent inn. I reveiwed their website and it seemed pretty average for an airport hotel...far from it! I kept telling my husband that it seemed like the type of place you see on those murder shows...or hotels that drug dealers live in! Very creepy! We stayed here for 3 hours and left. Never again! I advise you...pay the money and feel SAFE! On top of that, the staff were completely unprofessional and offensive. Terrible!!"
9,381,"Mar 16 2008 	Okay price hotel sucked!!!!!!!!!!	This hotel was okay for atleast the price I paid but the hotel sucked! The hotel clerks were very rude at all times, I asked for a non-smoking room when I booked it and when I arrived, not only did they put us way in the very back of the building, but also gave us a smoking room, the hot water did not work, there was a constant knocking thru out the walls at night, when you flushed the toilet it would give a loud screeching noise for a long time and then fade out eventually, they have ride times where they would take you to the strip and when you show up your told you have to wait a hour or 2 for the shuttle, its like, why have the times posted up and not go off that? They have a pop machine with high prices then normal and ohhhhhhhhhhhh, just so you know, taxi drivers do not like to go to this hotel, due to they say its hard to get back to the strip, or normal streets, so good luck.... theres no iron and if you want to loan one you have to give them your ID, the beds are hard.......overall....it sucked big time and I wished I had paid a few extra dollars for a better hotel! If you don't care about what I have said of what was wrong then this is the hotel for you, the price was coo, but if this will be your first time in vegas.....don't do it!"
10,381,"Feb 21 2008 	Dumpy  Dirty and Disgusting	In the future I would stay away from this motel. The alarm clock was unplugged when I entered the room. I got the time working but the alarm would not work. I called the desk to ask for a wake up call and for a remote control for the TV. Also to complain that the reception was really bad except one channel. They said that all remotes had been given out. As I was the second person to check in I feel they should have offered a remote then. Also, the wake up call never came. Thank God I woke up in time. I would have hated to pay an extra day for such an unrelaxing experience. Motel 6 is much better. I didn't even think of taking a shower in their disgusting shower. Yuck!"
11,381,"Feb 11 2008 	Not very good	Stayed here for new years eve. We didn't want to pay the extortionate prices demanded from the strip hotels. We paid 70/$140 for a twin room which was quite cheap for new years eve. This however was definitely a &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; scenario. This place is run down, the linen had cigarette burns/rips in it and the carpets were stained. The only good point was the location. It was only a 35-40 minute walk back from the MGM grand after the new years celebrations.Unless you are desparate, stay away! The only thing that kept me going was knowing that I would be staying in the Luxor the next night."
12,381,"Nov 18 2007	Our experience in Knightts Inn Paradise road Las Vegas Nevada	As part of an Internet deal with AARP and Travelocity we were booked in this Inn . We saw the pics shown in the internet as well as read the comments but decided to take a shot at it for the closeness to the action area ( as seen on Google earth ) , we arrived at night and a young lady at the front desk not even welcomed us . We had to carry our luggage (luckily they have wheels ) all the way from front desk to room 716 on a second floor with a stair with loose steps, for we did not had a rented car . The walk was like walking into a ghost town no one on sight and felt like I was going to get mugged the first day . Got to the room which had no clothes hangers, no closet pole for hangers , no remote control for the TV and the carpet was stained as well as the walls. Bed was very comfortable and linen was clean. Next day as I complained personally , got hangers, remote and closet pole from a very kind( spanish ) housekeeper and maintenance man Phone did not connected me to front desk. Days passed and they cleaned and changed the linen took away used house glasses but never left new ones. Also short toweled us for at one day we had one less towel to dry us. I left a tip and a note in spanish asking to have new plastic glasses left but as I understood there was no intention to serve for if the person who did the room did not knew spanish she could had taken the note to someone who did (The tip was taken needed no explanation note ) . Bottom line : the place is well located but badly administrated . This place in hands of a well known hotel chain could develop into a major hotel to stay . For now if thinking of booking there do it at your own risk ."
13,381,Nov 3 2007	The worst experience ever!	I felt like I was in a scary movie. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in with bugs in the room. We were desperate and this was the only place with rooms availble. None of us would even have a shower the next day..... we just wanted to get out as fast as we could as well as hoping our car hadn't been stolen the previos night. Very creep neighborhood as well!!!
14,381,"Oct 20 2007 	Really bad! Stay away!	Bad front desk service, ugly room, dead cockroaches in sink. Location is good. I would never use their pool."
15,381,"Oct 15 2007 	Dirty Dingy and Disgusting	Dingy and dirty--don't stay here. The photos shown for this hotel are actually of the St. Tropez Hotel. They share a transporation van. The Knights Inn is a very dirty, SRO, type facility. I needed one night near the airport and called a hotel service advertised on television that suggested they knew hotels. I asked for a room that was near the airport, but wasn't a creepy or dirty. The agent assured me the place was nice (I guess she based her impression on the incorrect photos). I paid $90. $90 for a dirty, flea ridden, unsafe hotel. The only positive thing I can say is it is close to the airport and they provide free transportation to and from the airport and into the city. It is dingy and dirty. I didn't feel safe or comfortable. The pool is full of pigeon feathers and other matter.I call the 800 number to cancel the reservation after I found I could stay at Hooters for $99. When I called the hotel service the rep. put me on hold to call the hotel, then disconnected me. Each time I called back, after going through the automated service, I was transferred to a busy signal and disconnected. When I reached them later, they said they had the wrong number for the hotel and couldn't get through to them. I called the hotel and they said I could not cancel directly through them, I had to do it through the 3rd party agent.I would not stay in this hotel, nor will I ever use the service that clearly does not know hotels."
16,381,"Sep 27 2007	Dumpy not Dirty	This place is a study in extremes. First and foremost, it's cheap, which usually means you get what you pay for, which is exactly what happened here. The hotel sheets were clean, as were the sink, tub, toilet, etc., but it's old, dilapidated, and dumpy. I suppose they're doing their best with a bad lot.Service was at times outright rude, yet at others (when my Cable TV wasn't working), very helpful and prompt (though they couldn't fix the problem)."
17,381,Jun 30 2007 	Must Read Before You Stay!!!!!!!	First the pictures that we saw ahead of time on the internet were misleading. Which was not even the worst part. When pulling down the sheets to go to bed i encountered a DEAD ROACH!!! Then when i was ready to shower the next morning to my surprise the towels were so small and they had these disgusting brown stains. I was mortified and disappointed with my stay. I would NEVER recommend this inn to anyone.
18,381,"Jun 12 2007	You get what you pay for. Clean. Simple.	What do you expect for the price you pay? I own a small business and when I am in town for a convention that is ALL I am there for. For this reason, I find the rooms clean and the place safe enough for my own comfort level.There are two pools now that they bought the old Howard Johnson's and it is very close to the airport (there is very little noice as well). I found many of the travelors are from Europe on tight budgets but very pleasant people.I am in the cleaning business and look at rooms much more directly than you would. The surface dirt was non-existant, behind the chairs, under the bed was clean (I was shocked!). The towels were on a scale of 10 a 2. They were clean however, but stained. I took out my washroom test kit and checked out the level of pH on the linen and they were within specs. They just need to upgrade to new linen and get a detergent supplier that knows how to wash linen. I expect that not it is a naional chain they will get better and better each year.The room I stayed in 132 had clean carpet and nicely tiled bath area. Good hot water and a shower head that did not rip the skin off your back as some of the water savings one do!This is why I gave it an above average rating. It is clean enough for what you pay for and safe enough to have a good night sleep.If you are looking for more then go to a bigger hotel and pay a bigger price!One of the big draws is that it is close to the best burger joint in town! The In and Out Burger by the interstate off Tropcania! What fun!On a closing note, the front desk people were very nice and smiled with ease. What may have been a poorly run hotel is now well managed and perfect for those on a tight budget!"
19,381,"May 29 2007 	Hotel [--]~ The Book	I wish there was a rateing less than 1. This &quot;Hotel&quot; doesn't eve deserve that much!!My future brother-in-law booked my mother and me a room at the Knights Inn &quot;Hotel&quot; over Memorial day weekend for his and my sister's wedding in Vegas. We checked in Friday, 25th of May. Well first off, we got into Vegas around 9am. We knew it was too early for check in, but thought we'd give it a shot. Afterall, some places are willing to give early check in's to travelers with reservations. Since my brother-in-law is the one that booked the roem, he decided that he would be the one to go in and ask about it. They told him that there would be no problem at all. So, he came out and told my mom that since the room was atually under her name, she would have to be the one to check in. When my mom went to do so, she was told that she couldn't check in early and whoever told her that she could, was lieing. We decided to just go to my sister and brother-in-law's room and wait for the check in time.When we finally got into our room, we wished we hadn't!There wasn't a trash can to be seen or a remote for the t.v. to be had anywhere in sight.When I turned on the water to take a shower, the head was spraying everywhere. It was hitting the ceiling and the wall by the toilet. When I stepped in I had a choice of 3 heat levels:ScoldBoilMeltBelow, however, there was only 1 heat level:Non-existantThe bathroom light kept flickering on and off. So at least half of my shower was spent in the dark.When I tried to get drink of water from the sink, the knob came off in my hand. I know I'm not Shera, so I know that I didn't break it.We were supposed to have my best friend and my sister's 4 children in our room during our stay. We needed more towels, pillows and blankets for this to be plausible.After requesting for those 3 items plus the missing trash can and remote 5 times, I decided to go to the front desk and ask for them personally, instead of over the phone or asking the non english speaking house keeping people like we had been. The lady at the desk called the house keeping guy and told him what we wanted. He said he would have it there in 5 minutes. After 20 minutes, my nephew went to the storage closet where he saw the guy just standing around smoking and asked him for our stuff. The guy gave him 1 blanket, 2 towels, 2 pillows and said that there are no extra trash cans or remotes for our room.During the evening, we had an unexpected visitor. Some guy just walked right into our room while we (luckily) were all sitting there eating our dinner. He asked if the room number was 412. We confirmed that it was, and he left. We never did figure out what the hell that was all about.The mattress' didn't have side panels. You could see straight into the springs. Everytime you got onto the bed, the top mattress slide off of the bottom one.Saturday morning, we all decided to move to another hotel.However, we had to make sure that it was alright with my brother-in-law, since he paid for the room for Friday and Saturday night. We needed to be positive that he would be able to get his money back for the night unused. He was told that since he booked through Travelocity, he would have to take it up with them. He said that he would just keep the room and give it to one of his friends that wanted to stay that night after the wedding but couldn't find a room in time.We moved to the Alexis Hotel Resort, which happened to be the same place as the wedding. The room was EXCELLENT!! Highly recommend this Hotel Resort.My new brother-in-law gave over the room key to him buddy for the Knights Inn. Everything was settled. Until his friend went to the room. The Knights Inn had doubled booked that room and there was someone else already in it.That entire place is a run down rat trap. Unclean, unkept, unworthy of anyone spending thier money on it. Why should we, when not even they will!!"
20,381,"Apr 22 2007 	Worst experience ever!	After an hour of driving in circles, we finally found the lobby to this place, not on Swenson but on Paradise. Check in with my confirmed reservation and credit card imprint was relatively uneventful but upon reaching our room, we knew this place was not going to be good news. Everything about it was shabby (at best), the carpet was filthy, the walls were stained and we couldn't stop the water from running in the toilet. Oh well, suck it up and try to get some sleep after a long day of flying. That lasted until 2 am, when we were woken up by someone rattling the door and trying to get in. This lasted about ten minutes, stopped for five then started up again. This time though, it sounded like an employee was trying to get in. Fed up, I yelled out that the room was occupied and was asked to identify myself. I opened the door a crack, told the &quot;security guy&quot; who I was and was told I was not registered. He left, but came back a few minutes later banging on the door. He told me I was illegaly in the room and had two choices, 1) vacate the room immediately or 2) he would call the police and have me arrested. Having had enough I told him we would go to the lobby and straighten this out. The desk however had no record of me and no imprint of my credit card. They finally located my online reservation and checked me in, demanding a second imprint of my credit card over my protests. Finally, back to bed at 3:30 am with no sleep for the rest of the night. And guess what, double billed for the room when I got home and checked my visa charges. This place may be cheap, but trust me, it's no bargain! Never again."
21,381,"Mar 30 2007 	Better than I read about	I actually booked this hotel, before I read up about it, so when I came here to see how it actually was, I was horrified. It was no surprise when I checked in, I feared the worst. After getting my key, going up the stairs, and being in front of my door, I carefully inserted the card, turned the knob, and took a deep breath. The room I had booked for, was exactly what I had booked for, a Cozy room. The room came with a massive King Sized bed, a Microwave, a Refrigerator, Coffee maker, TV, everything as described on the website. All of that, for a decent price, even through the weekend. I have to admit there was a couple of things that were &quot;off&quot; but not really going to change my view, or hopefully anyone else's view about it, but my room didn't come with a TV remote, and there was this small red mess on the wall, oh well. As far as I know &quot;Knights Inn&quot; is a budget hotel chain, so I would've been expecting things like that. I did get a nice view of the Stratosphere, among other parts of the strip, so thats another good point. Also the shuttle system worked better than described by fellow reviewers, its more &quot;On-Demand&quot; than &quot;Complain to the guy at front desk for shuttle&quot; The Van does have to travel between two properties. As far as I can tell, this Hotel has cleaned up its act, Its now fully a Knights Inn, the main office is located off of Paradise, not Swenson. And its a great alternative to any hotels that are located on the strip. I recommend this Hotel, to anyone wishing to save money, with an open mind for &quot;Budget Hotels&quot; 5 out of 5"
22,381,"Mar 19 2007	Homeless Paradise	WE BOOK IT BECAUSE PRICE $120.00 NIGHT WE THOUGHIT MAY BE MID RANGE BUT SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1- I called because we had a wedding at 2pm so we need time to change our cloths, contacted expedia and contacted the hotel they said will be ok to come early.2- arrived and they said not, check in has to be at 3pm and they said the person we contacted doesn't work there?? so how he answered the phone?? after they put me in hold??not explanation.3-anyway we went to the wed and checked in about 10 pm, they charged me another $50.00 as deposit i think, because it was paid in full in advance, wondering if they will give me back my deposit.4-going in it was a nightmare very dark alley and the stair waycracked and noice all over the place, so for me it was a bad badexperience and I booked 2 rooms, to my family sorry for this trip."
23,381,Mar 4 2007	Bad Room Worst Service	The most terrible hotel I have ever known if it can be called a hotel.We spent a bad night there. Bad smell in the room and bad food. the worst is the service and the attitute of the staff there.
24,381,"Feb 22 2007 	Not good enough to be named a Hotel.... (Maybe MOTEL) and that's being nice...	I would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER stay there again.... I attendent All Star Weekend this past Feb. Being that all other hotels were sold out I had no choice but to book with the Knight's Inn. From day one this place was a disaster. As my husband was washing his face the bottom pipe of the bathroom sink fell apart. OK, I thought to myself things happen I'll just call someone to come and fix it. Soon after what they call engineering came to the room to resolve thed problem. (I don't think this person had a high school diploma let alone a engineering degree) Later on after returning from the Las Vegas strip aroung 4:00am as my husband was getting ready to take a shower the bathroom light bulb blew out. I again called down to the front desk only to get a VERY RUDE individual telling me engineering was gone for the evening and there was nothing the hotel could do for me.... (Can you belive this???) My husband decided to take a shower with the hall light on leaving the door crack open only to have the shower curtain fall on his head.... (Can you say lawsuit!!!!) By this time he was so pissed off...As he went down to the front desk the agent I spojke with previously came from around the back office with a large pack of light bulbs.. (My husband is very large)... This to me was the worst group of front desk agents ever in life.... I complained to the mornig manager and demanded a refund... I too work in the REAL hospitality industry unlike this place... I know what to expect from a hotel and, if the Knight's Inn thinks this is the way to run they better think again..... Please people if you must stay in Las Vegas don't spend your money at the Knight's Inn... (SLEEP IN YOUR CAR!!!!!!) Another note don't eat in the Restaurant (More like a snack shop to me) the food is horrible.... I forgot to say yes I did get a FULL refund.... and my husband's head is doing just fine form the shower curtain incident.... :)"
25,381,"Nov 17 2006 	Rude Unhellpful Noisy	We booked this hotel through I4Vegas.com as our last night in the USA. We had had a fantastic holiday and I had asked my girlfriend to marry me so we were in a great mood...until we arrived at the Knight's Inn Las Vegas. We found a note saying the hotel was closed and that we had to go to the Howard Johnson hotel although there were no directions it transpored that this was behind the Knoght's Inn. We were checked in to this hotel and found our room to be very close to an extremely busy road, but otherwise very nice.It wasn't until 10 pm that night that the trouble began, we had it seemed extremely noisy neighbours. A group of kids running up and down the landing outside our room, we asked reception to come and ask them to be quiet and were told someone would be up. A couple of sleepless hours later we rang reception again, andwere told the receptionist had forgotten (how busy can she have been at 10pm?). Nothing happened again. So we basically got no sleep the night before we had to fly home and return to work. When we complained in the morning we were told that the hotel would do nothing and that we had to contact our agent I4Vegas.This hotel has the most unhelpful and ignorant staff I have ever had the misfortune to come across."
26,381,Nov 6 2006 	Perfectly adequate	Stayed here for a week at the end of Oct'06and found it suited our needs perfectly.It was clean and well kept.all the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful.As long as you realise this is an off strip motel and not a glitter and glitz strip hotel you should be just fine.As for all the other reviews on this motel I can only guess Americans are a lot more demanding than us europeans.
27,381,"Nov 4 2006 	Nightmare night in Vegas!!!	I had to move from Excalibur to this one on the 3rd day due to the high rates during the convention. This place was in unbelievably bad shape. We felt like we entered into a slum zone. They had shut down the hotel's lobby itself and directed us to visit the Howard Johnson Inn lobby (these 2 hotels are right next to each other). The staff weren't friendly at Howard Johnson inn. Upon opening the room, we smelt the same that you would smell in a dumpster. Carpets probably installed in 1950's or something. We could see chewing gum stuck in the carpet (almost dissolved into the carpet). When we turned on the window A/C, a mist of dust spewed into the room. The toilet and tub were the worst part and I don't even wanna describe it here. We had to keep the kids right on the bed (was OK bed) all the time. Infact, we checked out at 3 AM (even though airport was right next door) for our 8 AM flight as we couldn't sleep at all. I wouldn't have wasted $89 +tax had I known a hotel could be such bad shape. I would have rather found a cozy corner in the airport to spend the night. I would highly advise anyone to spend higher and stay in a different hotel. Afterall, we go to Vegas to have fun and not to fall into a depression. I hope tripadvisor will introduce a Zero star rating soon."
28,381,"Sep 10 2006 	Welcome toTrash Inn	This hotel is is piece of trash. Charge my credit card for the extra day as no show even if i did not stay there. Toilet not properly flushed, no towels, not fiendly staff. I had very bad experience in this hotel. If you want to enjoy your vegas vaction don't stay in this hotel."
29,381,"Aug 6 2006	A night in hades	This was the worst motel experience we have ever had. Arrived very late in the evening in about 80 degree weather to a large crowd checking in to the Knights Inn by being shuffled over to the Howard Johnson's next door. Very clear that the motel was heavily booked. Received our room, opened the door and determined that on 7/28/06 in Las Vegas, the room had clearly been shuttered up without the benefit of the management having turned on the air conditioning. The room was an oven. There was no other room available. In fact, the room was much much warmer than the outside air. The windows did not open either. We put the A/C on high and waited for it to cool. This took several hours of absolute agony. Even the furniture was hot! Why didn't we leave? Don't really know. Didn't feel like we had an alternative since we had just flown in from the midwest, were very tired and there were no other rooms available. Should have just left and fended for ourselves. Did I mention that it also smelled moldy? Avoid at all costs. Sleep in the car instead................................"
30,381,"May 9 2006	Not as bad as all that	We booked this place because we needed somewhere cheap to stay and also needed to be close to Vegas airport before continuing our trip elsewhere. Our flight landed late in the evening and by the time we'd picked up our rental car it was getting on for late in the day. We didn't have any real difficulties finding the place on Swenson (there was a big Knights Inn sign) but what appeared to be the main entrance to the hotelk was closed, which at that time of night was not what we needed. In the end we discovered we needed to go to the other side of the motel (Paradise Av) to what was signed as the Howard Johnson, which was also the Knights Inn apparently.Once we'd overcome this problem though we were perfectly happy. The staff were friendly and helpful and we found our room easily once we had the keys. As a one-night stopover the place fitted the bill perfectly and was clean, well equipped and pleasant. Not sure I'd recommend staying there for a whole week, but for a couple of nights or quick stopover it was just fine and at a great price!"
31,381,"Apr 26 2006	Knightmare - 'Knights Inn' - Not worth it	We booked 'Knights Inn' on the internet as rates were pretty reasonable (totally regret now) &amp; there was mention of free shuttle to and from airport. On arrival to Las Vegas at McCarran Airport I asked airport info desk staff &amp; also staff at the 'shuttle bus area' where the bus to Knights Inn leaves from? We got responses that there was no 'Knights Inn' place in Las Vegas. This was response from taxi, limo drivers too. I was a bit worried as I had rung the day before and confirmed with a 'Knights Inn' desk our booking. I tried calling the 'Knights Inn' again but no answer. About an hour later - 9pm, a kind shuttle bus driver agreed to help us find the place. After 2 hrs of driving up and down Swenson St, in and around the Strip area, downtown area and still trying to contact 'Knights Inn' phone number no one was answering, we discovered a place called 'Howard Johnson' on Swenson and decided to go ask. Sure enough, a rude front desk man said that Howard Johnson is 'Knights Inn' too (despite no clear signage on the front of the property). This man also said the 'Knights Inn' shuttle leaves from the lower level of the airport however the lady I spoke to to confirm the booking did not mention this detail to me and people I asked at the airport did not seem to know of a 'knights inn'!. This same rude man said there was no record of our booking and all rooms were full dispite me advising him I had called to confirm our booking the day before. I tried the calling a few other hotels pay phone in reception area (at my expense) I also tried calling the 'Knights Inn' number again when the man at front desk mentioned that I wouldnt get onto anyone as that number is for a lobby desk that is closed at 5pm. After another hour of trying to locate another place of accomodation another man came to front desk and asked for our booking numbers I had showed previously. This man disappeared &amp; came back with keys to a room as he located our booking on the system. No one was apologetic of the fact that we had just spend over 3 hrs to locate 'Knights Inn' and locate the booking for our room.As it was close to midnight, we decided to stay for the 1 night (original booking for 4 nights). Our room looked and smelled like it hadnt been occupied in months. The bugs in the bathroom made our stay very uncomfortable. The next morning we checked out and caught a cab to the Las Vegas Strip as the Knights Inn driver of 'complimentary shuttle' could not speak english.Overall, a disastrous start to our Vegas trip - especially after we had taken approx 14 hrs to get to Las Vegas! The rest of our trip we stayed at the Excalibur Hotel - a little more expensive but well worth it with regards to location, friendly staff, and clean rooms."
1,391,Loved Vegas	I liked our hotel they had finished renovating part of the hotel and upgraded our room for $20 since it was down season. I liked the hotel but found it really far down the strip from the shopping area but I would stay there again. It was clean and the staff was nice!!!
2,391,"If not for the concert package...	We stayed here because they were offering a Stevie Wonder (MGM) concert/2 night minimum stay package. The tickets weren't too shabby and the concert was great. The Luxor needs a good steam cleaning. I think it can be saved, but overall, I wouldn't stay there again. The pyramid room had finger prints all over the windows. If you have pyramid rooms, you really need to keep up with the windows. I mean they were so obvious. They need new management. And when we checked in of course they had no king size beds under the package price we got, so they tried to get us to &quot;upgrade&quot;= more money. We agreed for one night and then went back to a standard room the next. it wasn't about the money, it was about the principle. The standard room in the pyramid was &quot;nicer&quot; than the tower room. The workers kept telling us the opposite. The actually cleanliness of the room or lack there of had a downtown Vegas feel instead of &quot;the Strip&quot;. After you finish paying the resort fee, the upgrade (if you want a king bed) and taxes, the rooms aren't as cheap(in cost) as they seem. I would definitely just pay 20 or 30 bucks extra and stay somewhere else. Next time I'll go with the ticket deals the MGM is handing out instead of the Luxor, for sure."
3,391,"Dirty Trick!	I just wanted to say that this was a pretty dirty trick! We signed up for the guaranteed low rate thinking we would have a &quot;decent&quot; room. When we got there, we were asked if we wanted to &quot;upgrade to a &quot;higher level room&quot; we said no. We researched and knew that the rate we paid was within our budget and we were sticking to a budget. So.... you stuck us on the 4th floor - first we walked forever to the elavator then once on the 4th floor we walked past 50 - 60 (?) rooms just to get to ours. Then when we arrived we found our room to be over the filthy loud air vent from the restaurant (?) we could not even talk/hear each other in the hall as we tried to open the door. Once in the room, we found that we were to be looking out the window to a block wall. The carpets were awful - stained and dirty. It looked as if someone had already used the bathroom (probably the couple ahead of us who went to the room and walked out?). We went back to registration and paid the extra $20.00 flippin per night to be upgraded to the 9th floor. Why did you not just say on your web site that if you want crap here is the low rate. If you want decent you will pay $20.00 above the crappy room rate. Once we were on the 9th floor the room was great. However, the registration experence and the walk to and from the 4th floor room had left a bad taste in my mouth. I refused to spend any money in the hotel. We walked down the strip to gamble and eat. On a good note - the Titanic Exhibit was wonderful!"
4,391,"Watch out for old rooms	We booked the room using our Amex points. When we checked in we were given a room in the old wing of the hotel. The room was terrible - stained carpet, bathroom not cleaned properly and a peculiar smell in the hallway and the room. When I called to complain that this was not a 4 star quality room, the manager said that the ratings on the website were not their responsible and were recorded by the websites. Did she agree then that their hotel should not be a 4 star rating? We were given a room in a another wing, which was marginally better. Overall our experience left much to be desired. I would not stay at Luxor again."
5,391,"A once great hotel left to decay.	This hotel is large like most Vegas hotels with all the amenities but has not been maintained in years it seems. The carpet in the hallway to our room was bunching up so bad you could almost trip over the wrinkles, the rips where just covered with tape. The room was musty and old. The carpet and walls dirty with stains. The maid service was good but the towels where old and felt like sand paper. To make things worse the pool was closed for the season even though other hotels had there pools open. The location at the end of the strip is good if you like to be away from the action but New York hotel is nearby and would seem a better choice."
6,391,"Outdated - Dirty - Poor Service - Nickel 	Have been to Vegas several times, but never stayed at the Luxor, however I did know it was not a 4 or 5 star hotel going into my stay. We stayed their because the novelty of the hotel itself (pyramid shape) and the fact one of the 3 shows we saw was at this hotel (Chris Angel). As noted in the title - the hotel is old and dated and shows every bit of it - period. Inside, the walkways and hallways are dark and dirty. The ceilings have visual water leak spots, peeling wall paper and an 80's look and smell that goes along with it. The rooms again, are in need of a rehab. The curtains are old, the carpet is filthy, the beds are flimsy, the bathroom is dark, the towels are (all 3 the provide) are in need of replacing and just overall I felt like I was in an old 8-days Inn. The staff was inattentive, house keeping was provided only once a day and the hotel charged you for everything you could think of. If you need internet access - 14.99 a day (no wireless). A daily paper - 12.49 per day. Need to print a boarding pass at the business center - 1.00 PER MINUTE + cost of paper. I do not mind paying for services, however at the quality and level the Luxor provided - they should be paying their guests. There are so, so many other options available for staying on the Vegas strip - and the Luxor is NOT one of them. You will be very disappointed with your stay - as you can read by the other reveiwers here."
7,391,"Great location...	We got a really great price on travelocity when my husband and I went to Las Vegas this past March for our wedding. The location of The Luxor was great - on the south side of the strip. It was a convenient location, close to the hustle and bustle of the strip but far enough to not have to hear it. The rooms were clean and pretty updated. The hotel itself wasn't too noisy, especially considering its size. The casino wasn't too bad either ; ) We went to see Criss Angel while we were there and the line for tickets was relatively short. Nothing negative to say about the hotel at all. I would definitely stay again."
8,391,"Stunning Hotel- fun and lively.	Have always wanted to stay at this hotel, having been interested in Egypt since I was a child and I am glad I made it - rumours abound that this Hotel may abandon it's theme or even close- not sure if this is true. Visually, the hotel is stunning comprising of the main pyramid shaped atrium building containing all the amenities and rooms all the way around up to the top, and a couple of blocks with other rooms. It is bigger inside than it looks- we stayed on the 23rd floor and had a lovely view looking out to the mountains. My friend had booked online- beware of extra charges- tax is added to everything in the states, and there is a resort fee of 10.95 per day for newspapers and bottled water and unlimited phone calls within the U.S.A.-not much use to us, although we were glad of the water! the approximate cost of our 5 night stay worked out at $35 each per night which I think is acceptable ,especially compared to U.K. prices- this is for room only. The room had a subtle Egyptian theme, lovely big beds and enough storage space for the two of us= take some extra hangers,only 10 provided. The bathroom was shower only, fixed, so you had to wash your hair whilst you were showering-plenty of towels and facecloths and little bottles of toiletries were provided and replaced,there was also a hairdryer and spare socket for shavers/hair straighteners and other sockets in the room. Word of warning- there was an alarm clock in our room which was fixed, it had been set for 5.30 am and neither me or my friend could work out how to change the settings so I was woken at that time every morning ,no matter what I tried ! Check this when you arrive so you don't receive a rude awakening. The rooms have smoking or non smoking options- Las Vegas is a haven for smokers as you are allowed to smoke in the casino areas of the hotels,and in bars which do not serve food and you can also smoke outside,ashtrays are dotted around everywhere. As the main building houses the casino ,the cigarette smoke does filter through into the public areas so if you are a non-smoker, you may not like this aspect. Another thing due to the atrium design is the noise level- you can sometimes hear music and loudspeakers filtering up to your room and this can go on until quite late- we armed ourselves with sleeping tablets and earplugs and we were fine! Inside the main building are Egyptian statues and pyramid buildings (no photography is allowed in public casino/hotel areas unfortunately) There is a great selection of restaurants ,a food court, a nightcub and lively bars,24 hour shops and a great buffet, all you can eat for a fixed price- breakfast $15 or an all day ticket for $29. The hotel had a good location in between the Mandalay Bay hotel and the Excalibur- all accessible by tram from 11am or moving walkways or escalators- or if you exit at the front, you can get a taxi or walk down the strip to reach all the other hotels,casinos and shops. The thing I liked the least about being able to walk through from building to building is that they are dimly lit and you can spend hours in twlilight due to the lack of windows- it was getting dark by 5pm so you may have a whole day there without even seeing daylight! My friend who travels to Vegas quite often said that the strip was so long that you had to get taxis to get around, but I found that for me this was untrue- I don't mind walking and I prefer to be outside in the fresh air. perhaps the distances might be a struggle for someone in a wheelchair or people with small children, but you do get the great photo opportunites by walking along the strip. I found that getting taxis everywhere was an unecessary expense- you are expected to tip everybody and the taxis are on a meter so fares can be dearer than you think. Shop around if you are going to do any tours, and the Luxor offers special packages and discounts for it's guests for shows and exibitions like the Titanic exhibit, the CSI experience and Criss Angel. The hotels also offer a Players club reward scheme, you receive a card which you insert into the slots- the more you gamble, the more points you accumulate- you can use these in machines for all hotels in the group. My friend has one of these cards and we were able to redeem money off our room stay- leave your credit card open at the front desk on the day you check in. Handy tips for Vegas in general- drinks prices are expensive and often prices are not displayed anywhere, even in shops! You can get a shock if you order cocktails with dinner- we got charged $24 for 2 drinks and don't forget the price you see is not what you pay- 8% tax is added and then the tip or gratuity rate is between 10-15% on top of that. The cheapest option if you fancy a drink is to play the slot machines- cocktail waitresses come round, you order your drink and tip them $2 per drink,as long as you are playing you can order your drinks for the price of a tip and get nicely merry and if you are lucky, you may win a few dollars too! Outside the Hotel are some boxes with free leaflets and discount books for Vegas, you can also pick these up in the taxis- try to get some of these as soon as you get there to give you some ideas on where to go. I would recommend a minimum stay of 1 week- we went for 5 days and packed a lot in but still didn;t get to do everything we wanted- I would recommend that if you want to see the Grand Canyon, book this on the day you arrive for the following day- you will find it easy to get up for the early start before you adjust to Vegas time. We did the West rim trip as it is nearest- do not eat at the Ranch as the food is terrible- there are two other options on this tour for meals. Take sunglasses and a jacket or hoodie as it was chilly when we went. The skywalk is extra- approx $35 and helicopter trips are around $250 extra. We had a great time and I hope these tips have helped you !"
9,391,"Excellent hotel	The pyramid was the most awesome experience. The &quot;Inclinators&quot; are an experience every one should try at least once. The decor is awesome and the clubs and restaurants are 5 star. The shopping is wonderful, especially if you are into Egyptian art and artifacts."
10,391,"Beds fit for a mummy!	There are a lot of hotel in Las Vegas all vying for your dollar. There are many bargains to be found. Even in the luxury hotels.I would not call the Luxor a luxury hotel, but the rooms are OK. The beds, however, need a MAJOR fix. They are hard and hardly luxurious. It was not a comfortable night's sleep. The television also need an upgrade, to HD flat screens.The amenities are all fine, no complaints here. I ate at the buffet for one dinner, and while there were plenty of selections, the buffet doesn't offer the same amount of entree selections as the Mandalay Bay next door. But it's also less expensive.I have stayed at the Luxor several times for business; managed to get a little play-time in at the tables.The Luxor is not on the level of the Manadaly, which flanks it on one side, but is definitely a huge step up from the Excalibur which flanks it on the other side."
11,391,"Excellent much better than previous reviews suggested	First time in Las Vegas, and decided on the Luxor. However reviews leading upto us going on 10th November 2009, were not favourable. I raised my concerns direct with the hotel and was offered a free upgrade to one the tower rooms. We were given room 11341 in the East Tower. The room was huge, two massive kingsize beds and huge shower that could fit 5 people in, as well as a massive bath.The room was clean, great views out the front of the hotel. I would definately stay in the Luxor again and would recommend this to my friends.We ate the in the restaurant in the hotel and the food was very good. The walk between in Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur was good, the hotel are massive in Las Vegas."
12,391,"Beware of cheap rooms and value books with hidden costs	We booked our stay as a package deal through U.S.airlines. It offered $80 worth of comps and coupon books. We took advantage of every bonus we could. It was a good thing, as when we checked out we were stuck with a $76 charge ( a resort fee). It is charge per day for use of the pool and gym. The pool is only open seasonally so it was closed and we never used the gym. One plus was service, we were upgraded to a tower room because we needed ajoining rooms at no additional cost. The tower felt a bit isolated from the rest of the resort. In fact we never even walked around the hotel really, as it was such a walk from the tower. It was closer to walk across the street to Excalibur. It's a hotel that is REALLY far down the strip. Luckily we rented a car and were able drive to the center of the strip.My recommendation is to stay somewhere more centrally located, unless the Luxor is your intended destination. Don't stay here for the cheap price as it ends up costing the same with all if the hidden costs."
13,391,Nov 25 2009 	Home of Criss Angel!	I totally understand why the Mindfreak lives there. It's situated perfectly and we didn't even leave the hotel for our entire first day there was so much to do! I want to stay there again and again!
14,391,"Nov 25 2009 	amazing place	we visited las vegas in october, and found the luxor to be an amazing place to stay. we had a strip view pyramid room, with an amazing view of the airport, on the 16th floor. The Titanic show in the Luxor is something not to be missed. The Luxor is at one end of the strip, but you know this before you fly - and it is only $7 for a 24hr Deuce bus pass which allows you unlimited trips so it is incredibly easy to go from the nearby mall to downtown fremont street and all the hotels on the strip in between. the food buffet in the luxor is worth the all day buffet price of $30 dollars which includes all your food and soft drinks for the day. Shame they are starting to lose the Egypt theme, which is weird seeing as the hotel's main attraction is that it's a pyramid, which funnily enough is Egyptian, but hey, we'll take a look at the finished article when we return. Our main reason for the visit was to get married, which again, we would recommend to anyone - a very romantic day if you want it to be, with gondola rides at the Venetian, and trips up the Eiffel tower at the Paris, and of course the wonderful Bellagio fountains....... and yes, we will be goign back."
15,391,"Nov 23 2009 	HOLY SMOKE !!!	Coming from Canada, I was absolutely apalled by the smoky atmosphere of this hotel! From the moment you walk in, it harken you back to the days of being z kid of the 70's with smoke wafting through the air no matter where you hide. Wouldn't stay here again solely for this fact. Service was fine, portions crazy big., What a waste!"
16,391,"Nov 23 2009 	felt sooo dirty	1. trying to get to the room? how about having to walk two sides of the casino to get to my room? after walking the strip, the last thing anyone should have to do is walk two walls to get to their room.2. looking over the casino, one can see all the dirt on top of the statues inside the bldg. gross!3. walls are paper thin..could hear what was going on all around me!4. taking a shower? drain didnt work properly and by the end of the shower there i am in 1 inch of water.would i stay at this hotel again? even for free!? N-O"
17,391,"Nov 23 2009 	Better than expected	We stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights in their most basic room on the 5th floor. I was worried it would be a little noisy since we were in the pyramid section of the hotel but was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was. Room was basic and good for what we needed--- a place to sleep. Service was standard- nothing over and above. In previous stays in Vegas, I never really made it south of NYNY so staying at the Luxor was nice. The best thing about the casino-- not as smoke filled as other casinos."
18,391,"Nov 22 2009 	Fantastic value	Second time this year we have stayed at the Luxor and again, the staff could not do enough for us. We found the room to be very clean, every day we stayed there, we had no complaints and were given a late check-out with no hassles or cost. Location is in the quieter end of the Strip, but we love walking, so walked every day. All in all a terrific escape."

20,391,"Nov 21 2009 	Dated Decor wished we had stayed somewhere else	We booked the Spa suite as we were getting married in Vegas, lots of people had told us nice things about the Luxor so we were confident in our choice. We were so dissapointed the room was tierd and dated, the bed lined was bitty and well used as were the towels. the lifts were shabby and it was very noisy. Freinds and family had got better deals in better hotels and we were dissapointed as we were after a bit of luxury. Very basic hotel rooms, walking through the casino it smelt like a greasy spoon cafe, we had breakfast one morning there and it was not cheap, went the Mandalan Bay for breakfast which was a lovely experience and a lot cheaper!! The Room service in Luxor even charged us for ordering glasses with wine $4.50 each!! Its ok if you get good room rates and you are on a budget break and dont care about the room - good location to the strip."
21,391,"Nov 20 2009 	Beautiful looking Hotel......rooms not so much.....sketchy area after dark.	Stayed one night only. This hotel has a breathtaking interior entertainment area. Great exhibits and shows here, food great too. Its definitely well worth coming in to have a look and take some things in.The room was horrible. Bedcovers stained and looking pre-1978. Small and dated room. Even though our room was quite expensive, it had absolutely no view of anything. Very long walk to everything. In the evening, checked out the strip on the walkways to/from the inside of the Luxor. Very sketchy travelling through here. No security anywhere along the walkway and all sorts of people were wandering around. Oh yes, and while leaving in the morning, several cars in the parking area had their car alarms going off. Some were going for a long time evidently, sounded like batterys were dying. One car had its windows smashed out, glass everywhere .........no security whatsoever...... Hope you have insurance.Good for entertainment and sightseeing, bad for accomodations and creepy travelways."
22,391,"Nov 20 2009 	Glad we stayed	arrived 8am from airport, room available straight away. Pyramid spa suite (3 females) was awesome. Very roomy, big bathroom, seperate living room, seperate jacuzzi next to tinted window with views over mountains at the back of the strip. If you stay pay a few extra $ and have a spa room! Jacuzzi is amazing after a long day trekking up the strip. Corridors bit shabby but impressed by the (4 corner) lifts that move diagonally upward. Foyer quite impressive (if not a little dated) lots going on, and till all hours (macs at 4am!) but froogle on the free casino drinks! (Go Mandalay Bay instead!). Pool area looks good from a distance, but was a bit shabby and a bit (dare I say it) Chavvy, with gangs of people (mainly youths) drinking in the pool. Overall pleased we tried this place out, but also got similar (slighty cheaper) rate at Bellagio and MGM Signature Suites (not MGM Grand) and this place paled in comparison to those!"
23,391,"Nov 20 2009 	Good Holiday	We stayed at this hotel 6 years ago so we went with it again, then read some of the comments and our hearts sank. Check in took 10 mins tops we do not have a credit card so didn't pay the $15 a day charge we left all the papers neatly stacked and un read, we had a room in the pyramid very easy to find it was clean towels changed daily and the bedding was changed. Yes the hotel is looking tired but if you use the room to sleep what does it matter if it needs a lick of paint. We also never had anything but politeness from any staff members as for the time share touts they are in all hotels evan Caesars Palace. It is a good walk from here to Caesars, Venation, Belagio ect but that is half the fun.My advice to any one who has this hotel booked is go with a open mind, the company we booked through didn't rate it as a 5 star but 3 so we got better than we expected, would I stay here again yes I would."
24,391,"Nov 19 2009	Do not even consider it!!!	This hotel is appalling. No standard what so ever. Most of us come from homes of a much better and cleaner quality. Stayed here for three nights recently and was appalled at the lack of standards in every way. I booked a room with a bath and when I arrived a young lady tried to charge me another 69 dollars for the privilege of a bath as opposed to a shower. They seem to work on the principle of offering you sub standard accommodation and when you naturally reject it they offer you better but charge you extra. The hotel is jaded and old. Housekeeping seem overworked and considering what they have to work with do quiet a good job but they cannot make the hotel into something it is not, namely a good quality accommodation Do yourself a favor and find another hotel. This place seems to target &quot;the great unwashed&quot; ."
25,391,"Nov 19 2009 	The Suxor	My first time ever in Vegas and we're staying at this kitschy hotel shaped like a pyramid. I was jacked. Then we got there. To start with the people at the hotel desk were, at best, rude. Yes, the lobby is opulent and the casino is rocking, but the wait to check-in is forever, and then we get a room in the west tower and it's just about Motel 6 quality. Seriously, the most basic of hotel rooms - dirty carpets, beds made of straw from the Egyptian era, no desk, no coffee maker, the $15 Internet connection didn't work, and to top it off the people next door to me were doin' the do in a loud way the next morning at 8 am and the onion paper-thin walls did nothing to conceal their great passion. What happens is Vegas can stay in Vegas if it's at the Luxor. If I ever go back to Sin City I will absolutely stay somewhere else. This place is pretty much a hole with a casino in it. It sux big time. Stay away."
26,391,"Nov 19 2009 	Just Unbelievable	We had a spa suite and the suite was huge, the size of a apartment. Service ,meals etc top class. People are so friendley."
27,391,Nov 19 2009 	Staying in a pyramid	It was a nice stay... the rooms are nice but there was no view outside... (Jsut some junk) They did an outstanding job in the lobby and it is connected to 2 other great hotels... Mandilay bay and Excaliber. The buffet in the luxor was great ad a steal for 30.00 / all day. There is also a free tram stop right out front that goes to a bunch of other hotels on the strip.
28,391,"Nov 18 2009 	A really unique Las Vegas landmark!!!	I have been to the Luxor a number of years ago and was surprised to find out that Luxor is still one of the best hotels on the strip. It was elegant inside, very helpful staff, good variety of restaurants and all in all still very luxurious and classy. It was also convenient that you can go to either Mandalay Bay or Excalibur without even going out on the streets. Definitely will stay there again!!!"
29,391,Nov 18 2009 	beautiful luxor	i am so happy with our stay here. our room was excellent!
