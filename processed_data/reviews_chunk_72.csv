118,1789,"Apr 25 2009 	Location Location Location	I travel to New York about once a month for business. I don't care very much where I stay in terms of location in the city. I'm looking for a clean, safe, 4 star property. I usually try to book on priceline and the results are usually good.This hotel is in the perfect location if you are a tourist. It is in the heart of times square. Steps away from the theater, the touristy restaurants, rockefeller center, etc. Check in at 5:30 p.m. was courteous and quick. My room was on the 18th floor. It was modern, clean and comfortable. There was a flat screen t.v. with movies and free hbo. I liked the fact that there was a guard by the elevators at all times to make sure that you were supposed to be in the hotel.There was nothing amazing,or noteworthy about the service or hotel. However, if you are looking for a clean, safe, nice place to crash after busy New York Day, this is a good one."
119,1789,"Apr 23 2009 	Fantastic location and amazingly comfortable beds!	We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square for 3 nights in April 2009 and would definitely return. The beds were fantastically comfortable which is just what you need after a heavy day of shopping and sightseeing in New York! It was strange that even though we were on the 27th floor we could still hear all the hooting from the streets below but we got used to that. The location is perfect - right in the centre of Broadway with all its theatres (we went to see Shrek the Musical which was brilliant) and within walking distance of all the sights. We went by train to get the Staten Island Ferry but we walked back from there stopping on the way at Ground Zero and the Tribute WTC Visitor Center which is definitely worth a visit. We then went bargain hunting at Century 21 and our visit to Macy's during Flower Week was great - the creations were absolutely amazing. We carried on walking all the way stopping at various shops and finally stopped at the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner before going back to the hotel and our lovely comfy beds for a good night's sleep! We went up the Rockefeller Center and as the weather was so good we had the most amazing views of New York from the top. The hotel is next door to the Hershey store and right opposite the M&amp;M store - a chocolate lovers delight! We didn't eat in the hotel but the cocktails were lovely! We also ate at TGI Friday which was OK and Carnegie Deli which is always great - the portions are massive and the food delicious!The only complaints were that our neighbours had a Chinese takeaway one night and put their leftovers in the corridor which stank - when we told Reception they said they would get it cleared immediately but it was still there 24 hours later - as was a huge bag of dirty towels??! And also, my husband and daughter went to the pool but too many lanes weren't available to the public and the pool was freezing."
120,1789,"Apr 22 2009 	Beware - you don't get what you've paid for!	The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that's it's a great location! Like other reviewers on this site, we booked months in advance but upon arrival found that due to 'the hotel's policy of overselling' ( the general managers words , not mine) the spacious corner room on a high floor that we had booked was not available and there was nothing we could do. We ended up in a standard room on the 19th floor for the first night, then got moved for the remaining 3 nights to the 41st floor, but again a standard room. We booked direct with the hotel and our confirmation stated that breakfast was included but when we arrived they tried to tell us that it was a typing error!! After much remonstration they relented and gave us vouchers for breakfast (how good of them). There were not enough towels in the room, despite several requests, the complimentary fruit basket promised in the booking confirmation never materialised despite asking several times, neither did the gift box on check-out that was promised (by then I was too cheesed off to even argue about it.) After much protestation they did knock $160 off the bill which didn't make much of a dent and certainly didn't compensate for the aggravation or disappointment. Seriously folks, although our room was clean and tidy, the staff on reception, who constantly rotate so you never get the same one twice, were on the whole unwelcoming and surly. I would really give this hotel a miss if you are hoping for your stay in the Big Apple to be memorable for all the right reasons. I have stayed in much better hotels in the city for a whole lot less."
121,1789,"Apr 19 2009 	New clean and quiet....an oasis.	My husband and I just returned from a three night stay here. Check in and check out were very easy. Our room was clean and spacious, with a great view of Times Square. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well as the room was quiet. The only reason I did not give a perfect rating for service is having to ask three times for more coffee in our room, all we had was decaf when we arrived. We ended up at the Starbucks right across the street. I also had to ask for shampoo on the second day. The convience and ambience cannot be beat."
122,1789,"Apr 19 2009 	Not What We Expected...	My family and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan(Times Square) for a 3 day/2 night trip to NYC. Let me start off by stating the positives: the location is amazing. The hotel is situated right in the heart of Times Square on Broadway and 48th Street. The lobby is very nice and modern, and there were friendly bell-hops to help us with our bags/taxis. We stayed in a Concierge Level room, which came with access to the 46th floor Club Room. They provided a wonderful continental breakfast and some nice afternoon snacks/wine. Now on to some of the major issues we had with this hotel...First of all, upon check-in, we were greeted by a very surly front desk clerk who proceeded to tell us that our room was not ready yet (even though we had requested an early check-in months ago), but loudly announced that our credit card was declined. She demanded a photo ID and another credit card. When we gave her a working card, she didn't say much more than &quot;we'll call you when your room is ready.&quot; While waiting for our room, we decided to have lunch at the hotel restaurant. The service was INCREDIBLY slow, even though we were one of the only tables. An incredibly salty grilled cheese sandwich cost almost $15...the salmon burger my husband ordered was also so salty he could barely eat it--but hey, I guess that's New York. My $11 glass of wine was only filled a quarter of the way(about as full as the size of my pinky) and the $10 chocolate ice cream was frozen solid. After nearly 2 hours at lunch, our concierge level room was ready. We were on the 45th floor and were immediately surprised to find our &quot;guaranteed&quot; Times Square view was actually a view of a taller building and a sliver of the Hudson River in the distance. No Times Square view even though we requested it months ago, and we were told we would get it! We immediately called down to ask to have our room changed and were told that the hotel was totally sold out and there was nothing they could do. A second attempt in person failed also. We were promised robes and slippers for all in our party, but we only got one robe and no slippers, even after asking housekeeping to send up more robes. Housekeeping left garbage in the room each day and never replaced the coffee cups or the sugars/creamers. There was only one shower towel in the bathroom when we arrived, but they did bring more when asked. Our daily complimentary newspaper was non-existent. We were charged over $100 for so-called &quot;complimentary&quot; wireless internet and only had it taken off our bill when we presented our printed contract to the management. The pool was a joke. There was only one tiny lane open for hotel guests and the water must have been below freezing. It was SO cold that I couldn't stand to go in for more than a minute, even though we had WAITED 20 minutes before it was our &quot;turn&quot;. We also had no idea that there was a $4 swim cap surcharge per person, so we had to go back to our room to scrounge up EXACT change. The list just goes on and on and on....We were very excited to go to this hotel based on their website. BE WARNED- this hotel is NOT all it promises to be. If it weren't for the great location, and the very nice concierge lounge, this hotel would have not much going for it. The next time we stay in NYC, we will definitely try a different hotel."
123,1789,"Apr 18 2009 	Top Location 	From check in through room comfort and service couldn't fault anything. Great location within Midtown, with Times Square and all that goes with it on doorstep, but easy walking distance to Central Park and shopping areas. Would certainly recommend to anyone, can't comment on room costs as I was on a Priority Club Reward break. Rooms were spacious and bathroom / shower facilities good. For 1st time visitors make sure you take the Gray Line Tour bus trips. First day stay on for entire trip unless guide is uninteresting. Just hop off and get the next bus. 2nd day get off and on every few stops and have a half hour walk about the neighbourhoods, only way to get the feel of the city. Route obviously changes from time to time as there was some locations missed out from my last trip. If the sun is out, head for the park, its all you see in the movies and tv shows and more, overflowing with entertainers and characters. Only place I have seen a dog with a dress and shoes on!! Liberty Island was impressive, didn't make Ellis on this trip, but head down to the ferry early. Similar with Empire State building, less queueing at night, make sure its not foggy though, we couldn't see the building across the street never mind miles away. Whatever you do, get out and about, take good shoes and cut down on party wear, you'll be too tired to head out at night too often."
124,1789,"Apr 18 2009 	Best location - Friendly Staff - 3* Rooms	They can go the extra-mile, but... only if you ask it. Valet parking staff is rude, others are very friendly.I expect more care about details on room furnitures, especially in bathroom. They should go back to their suppliers and show them how they neglected many details in the renovated rooms. Great view on times square. I would definitely stay again."
125,1789,"Apr 15 2009 	Nice hotel...needs better attention to detail	Stayed here for four nights on vacation. Rooms are nice, if small, with great views. Beds very comfortable, and flat-screen TV in room. Great location on Broadway. Unfortunately, we had a few issues during our stay. We arrived very late, around 1am, and on entering our room, we found that it had been used after being cleaned, so had to change rooms.During our stay, various items such as towels and bath mats were not replaced, so ended up with no bath mat and only one towel, even after calling the front desk. A request for a razor and shaving foam took a day and several phone calls, and finally attempting to arrange a late check out took endless phone calls and buck passing to arrange.I would stay at this hotel again, especially at the rate we paid, but the hotel management needs to look at these detail areas!!"
126,1789,"Apr 14 2009 	If I could afford it I would ALWAYS stay at this hotel in NYC!	I LOVE this hotel! I've stayed at many hotels in NYC &amp; this one is by far my favorite! I travel to NYC several times a year w/my kids (last year, 4 times!) &amp; if I could afford it I would always stay here! The staff at check-in was FABULOUS, they were so nice! All of the public areas were clean &amp; mighty nice. Our accommodations were AWESOME! I loved our room! Bed was comfy. Renovated last year. Everything was clean. Only 1 tiny complaint is the water pressure for the shower is not as strong as I would like to rinse shampoo out of long hair. The location is the best for Times Square. Hotel is right on Broadway between 48th &amp; 49th street. Very safe for walking at night. Duane Reade drug store is at 50th &amp; Broadway, which is great for beverages &amp; snacks (if you want to save a little $). The Food Emporeum (a grocery store) is @ 49th Street &amp; 8th Ave. (1 block away) they have awesome baked goods &amp; hot foods ready to eat sold by weight. Mama Sbarros is right across the street. They have a large selection of pizzas &amp; a hot &amp; cold buffet sold by weight along with different Italian dishes you can buy. It's another good way to make your dollar go farther. Subway is only a block away. If you plan on using the subway or buses alot get an unlimited metro card for the week, as of this moment it costs $25. &amp; you can ride the subway or bus as much as you want with it (it's a per person card). If you're reading this I want to say a SPECIAL THANK YOU to Edith &amp; Teresa at The Crowne Plaza, you were so kind &amp; treated me so well!"
127,1789,"Apr 12 2009	Fantastic Hotel	I would highly recommend this luxury hotel to everyone visiting New York, its location right in the heart of Times Square is fantastic.We stayed for 7 nights and had a fantastic time. The room was excellent and of a good size and there was also some very nice touches to the room.I would highly recommend the Brasserie 1605, we had breakfast there every day and it was excellent.The hotel itself is exceptionally clean, well maintained and very quiet."
128,1789,"Apr 11 2009 	Good enough if you book through Hotwire...	I went up to NYC on Friday to join my partner, who had been in NYC that week for work. We stayed Friday night at the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square and Saturday night at the Crowne Plaza. My partner's work didn't pay for Saturday night at the Renaissance, hence we booked the Crowne Plaza through Hotwire for $179, which I felt was a really good price for NYC. All I can say is that the Renaissance was super chic, beautiful, quiet, and extremely professional. The Crowne Plaza, however, wasn't as chic. It was nice, but it didn't have the same ambiance as the Renaissance. The Crowne Plaza lobby also was a madhouse of rude Europeans. I must say though that the staff at Crowne Plaza was competent and friendly, although not quite as polished as the staff at the Renaissance. The room was considerably less enticing at the Crowne Plaza and there was constant noise from the halls. This, however, is not so much a reflection of the hotel, but rather its clientel. With that said, I was aslo one those paying $179 a night through Hotwire.I got what I paid for. In that sense, there is nothing to really complain about."
129,1789,"Apr 8 2009 	Great Hotel in NYC	I stayed at the Crown April 3-5, 2009 with my mother and 2 children ages 6 and 10. I was not expecting much as I have stayed in several NYC hotels and know how they usually are. I was pleasantly surprised with the Crown in more ways than one. First off the price; I received a rate of $240 per night because I used the Entertainment Card discount. That was over $150 off the regular room rate. You cannot stay anywhere decent in NYC for that price. The location of the hotel was great. Being in Times Square was wonderful and my children felt like they were in the middle of all the action. The hotel has been totally renovated recently. It was beautiful and clean. The rooms were the largest I have seen in NYC and they were decorated very nicely. We had a large bathroom with tub and shower combo, 2 double beds, and a flat screen tv. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have slept in. We were on the 36th floor of the hotel and were surprised how quiet it was. We thought we would hear noises from the streets but didn't hear anything. My only complaint and it really wasn't a big deal was that they would not give us a roll away bed for my 10 year old. They said that due to fire regulations they could not give us one. In my opinion there was plenty of room and then some for a roll away bed, but again it ended up being no big deal at all. We all slept very well and enjoyed our visit at this hotel. The best part of the hotel was that they offered parking directly on site. They had their own garage so I felt safe and it wasn't over priced either like most parking in NYC is. We will definelty go back and I recommend this hotel to anyone."
130,1789,"Apr 8 2009 	WOW - super hotel!!	We stayed in Crowne Plaza Times Square from Mar 25th to 29th, location is amazing footsteps from Broadway, Times Square, Port Auth etc. Hotel was beautiful, fantastic &amp; very helpful staff, We asked staff on many occasions to recommend places to eat, visit &amp; drink and all places were fantastic (would highly advise eating in Carmine's Italian but be warned portions are HUGE!!) Rooms great &amp; very clean. Cant imagine staying anywhere else in Manhattan ever again. Thank you for a great break x"
131,1789,"Apr 3 2009 	Slept divinely!	First note of caution, the main entrance to this hotel is not on Broadway and the entry on Broadway is understated. For those walking up from the subway look up for the awning! I missed the entrance. Not a problem, obviously my fault I didn't see it, but I was expecting a major entrance on Broadway. I spent only one night here, and it was purchased on Priceline. It was a *great* value. I slept so well, and the location was ideal for enjoying some downtime in the tourist center of NYC. The decor of the room is what I would consider a standard NYC modern contemporary -- clean lines, soft colors, minamilist. Great comfy bed, good shower &amp; towels. I only noticed on checkout that they do provide an in room coffee pot, it is tucked away out of sight.There is a nice lounge that overlooks Broadway, it's not large but tasteful and trendy. They were running a Whiskey Wednesday special, which I did not get take the chance to enjoy, but it gave a fun atmosphere to the lobby. I did take breakfast in the 1605 Brassierie. It had a nice menu, but I stuck with eggs and toast. Nothing special, but it was what I wanted. Overpriced, of course, but I was looking for convenience. I think my entire breakfast order (eggs, juice, coffee) was $30.Internet is $20/day."
132,1789,"Mar 29 2009 	Excellent Service All Around	I chose this hotel as a bday trip/ stay for my Mom's Birthday trip to NYC for her very first time. Having stayed in NYC before, I knew being in Times Square was the most exciting and convenient place to be to see it all ( night and day). On March 25, 2009, we finally arrived to the Crown Plaza Times Square and were not disappointed at all with the special treatment we received from the step out of the cab to the front door. The location is great. Times Square is a step outside, Hershey's is right next door and Broadway is right there. The staff at the hotel was so nice. Robert ( the front desk staffer) was unbelievable sweet in my hotel floor request. He sent us all the way up to the 40th floor so that my mom could see it all even from the hotel room. The rooms were beautiful and clean. Safety was great too! We went out one night and came in really late. The hotel staff made sure to check for room keys before getting aboard the elevators and then escorted us up to our room due to the fact that we were all females. LOL. Would definently recommend this hotel to anyone who asks. The only downside to the hotel is that they do not have refrigerators so if you plan to bring food back, DON'T or put it on ice in the bathroom sink. Anthony at the restaurant bar was very sweet to my mom and aunt when they sat for hours just relaxing and drinking coffee in the restaurant. No one made them feel like they needed to spend more just to sit somewhere for a while."
133,1789,"Mar 24 2009 	Refurbished and Fabulous	My partner and I stayed here for two nights at a promotional rate of $149 per night. We got a great corner room on the 43rd floor with a window view wrapping around Broadway and Times Square. The rooms and bathrooms were renovated in a mod-chic style, and the bed was lush and comfortable. Just literally steps away from Times Square and close to several major subway stations, it was a great value. The only drawback was the extra fees charged for wireless internet connections and use of the gym/pool (actually a NYC Sports Club on the 15th floor)."
134,1789,"Mar 23 2009 	Perfect location great hotel.	Spent the weekend in NYC with my husband and my sister-in-law and brother-in-law. We stayed at the very busy Crowne Plaza in Times Square on 49th &amp; Broadway. Ideal location. Clean, big, open lobby with lots of comfortable seating. Bar overlooking Broadway (though we didn't get a chance to enjoy...we were just too tired when we came back to the hotel in the evening for a nightcap). Rooms were quite spacious and quiet. Our bathroom had a shower/toilet separated by the sink/vanity - very nice feature. Our room was right on the corner of Broadway and 49th Street with a great view and big windows, yet was surprisingly quiet at night."
135,1789,"Mar 15 2009 	Watch out for the front desk	Be sure to bring a printed copy of your booking when you stay at this hotel. We booked a Crowne Room online (directly from Crowne Plaza) which said in the booking &quot;NEWLY RENOVATED HIGH FLR ROOM LOCATED ON 41 TO 43 FLOORS&quot;, but at check-in the guy at the desk denied that we had booked a Crowne Room! He tried to give us a corner room on the 22nd floor, claimed that we had booked a corner room. After a bit of arguing he gave us a room on floor 42. The room was very nice with a great view of NYC and I have no further complaints other than the front desk issue."
136,1789,"Mar 15 2009 	Perfect room - Great Lounge - We will return	Wonderful hotel, we had a nice corner room on the 46th floor. They have a very nice lounge, however with dinner reservations each night at the likes of Daniel and Per Se we never availed ourselves of the lounge (although seriously - it was as nice as anything overseas - this was not your standard US hotel executive floor lounge).Room was nice, clean - staff was friendly, professional.Hotel is perfect for either business or leisure (we've done both here). I love the place - it's a great deal (rooms for under $300). As nice as the W, IC, Hilton(s), etc...Desk and Internet access are great for getting some work done (desk is large enough to work at (a real consideration in NYC)). The room is nice enough to enjoy spending a few moments in - overall - we loved it.We enjoyed it and we'll go back.1. I wish they had a large tub in addition to the shower.2. I loved the shower - but the wife pointed out you could not turn it on without getting wet (awkaward placement of faucet handle).3. The hotel main entrance is between the side streets - difficult to get a car there (even my dial 7 limo's were confused)."
137,1789,"Mar 13 2009 	Great Hotel brilliant loaction and top service	Just returned from a 4 night stay at the crowne plaza and had the best time.The rooms are spotless and the beds really comfy. The service we recieved was second to none with the reception staff arranging a king size, newly renovated room with a view of the Hudson River and complementory breakfast on the morning of my birthday.I'd highly recommend that you use the concierge as much as possible during your stay. They advised of some good restaurants to eat at, one of which was Ruby Foo's (chinese) directly across from the hotel and whilst talking to the waiter he gave us a 50% off voucher for Phantom of the Opera !!If you're looking for a hotel that has a central location, great service and rooms you look forward to sleeping in then book here. It can be quite expensive to book direct with the hotel unless you use some of your priority points so shop around on some of the search engines as we got a 4 night stay through cityandshow.com for 530."
138,1789,"Mar 10 2009 	Great hotel only a couple of issues	Type of trip: Business Trip / PleasureRoom Type Stayed in on Trip: Business Room (Executive Floor) Main things I look for this type of trip are:Quiet RoomsClean RoomWelcoming / comfortable roomGood showerGood size towels Room fan / airconBlack-out curtainsIroning Board in RoomComfortable bed, duvet, with the ability to request feather pillowInternet in Room with area to workEnough sockets to plug Laptop and phonesFilms on Demand on TV and good size TVToiletries provided and ability to order bathrobe and slippersRoom serviceGood breakfastExtras (Fitness room, sauna, steam room, pool)This hotel fared as follows:Quiet room: Very quiet, room was high floor overlooking harbour and aircon fan was loud enough to drown out anything that may be heard from outside.Clean room: VeryWelcoming / comfortable room: Newly refurbished, very inviting.Good shower: Good, no bath.Good size towels: Sadly towels were not the size I would have expected, quite small.Room fan / aircon: YesBlack-out curtains: YesIroning Board in Room: YesComfortable bed, duvet, with the ability to request feather pillow: Bed was very nice however much to my surprise the bed sheet was not 100% cotton (40% polyester, 60% cotton) and you could feel it. I did not check if they had feather pillows as the synthetics were good.Internet in Room with area to work: Wireless internet at a (steep) extra charge $19.50 per day. Quite fast.Enough sockets to plug Laptop and phones: YesFilms on Demand on TV and good size TV: Very large flat screen TVToiletries provided and ability to order bathrobe and slippers: All provided as standard in room.Room service: YesGood breakfast: I had the basic but still nice complementary breakfast in the Executive lounge, great views of the city as it is on the top floor.Extras (Fitness room, sauna, steam room, pool): Yes, but did not have time to check them out.Overall: Great hotel, right in the middle of everything, very comfortable. The executive floor has free evening drinks and snacks and free breakfast and has great views. Only slight negatives were the smallish bath towels, I would have expected bath sheets in a hotel like this and in the executive rooms. I also was very surprised that the sheets were not 100% cotton and you could really feel it. That is the first time in any of the hotels I have been to that this has happened, either they all were mixed polyester and cotton and I could not feel it or they were 100% cotton, I have never got into bed and thought what is wrong with this sheet and checked what it was made of. Either way this was a real no no to me especially in this class of hotel."
139,1789,"Mar 10 2009 	Great location great staff use your Priority points for a great deal	This was my first non Business trip to New York, so this hotel was superb for position. I used (Holiday Inn) Priorty club points which was a bargain, it also got me a free upgrade to 45th floor with free buffet breakfast and evening drinks in the club room on 46th floor. The staff were very helpful indeed, always pleasent and attentive.If you are new to New York, then the Underground (Subway) is a very good way to travel. We bought one of the many tour bus tickets, which is OK but not geat value. Found a very nice Cafe, Jazz bar in the Village called the Garage right outside the subway station Christopher Street on the 1 line."
140,1789,"Mar 8 2009 	Couldn't be Better	Check-in great. Asked for a quiet location and got a corner on 24th floor. Everything was spotless and tastefully decorated.We ate at a Thai restaurant on 49th that was fantastic. Pongl....forgot spelling but they will tell you at front desk. Breakfast was great, but very pricey. We were only 2 blocks from our theatre. Had coffee and dessert at Roxy Deli on Bway.Yum!! Great location for the theatre."
141,1789,"Mar 5 2009 	Great Location Even Better Hotel	This hotel is great. Was recently redone. Lobby and rooms are immaculate. Service was great. Was there for 3 nights with wife and we both enjoyed the stay. Beds very comfortable. The location is in the middle of it all, Times Square. Definately recommend!!"
142,1789,"Mar 2 2009 	Recently Renovated Hotel at the Edge of Times Square	Our recent stay at this hotel could not have been better. This hotel is at the edge of Times Square and was completely renovated last year. Everything was new and of high quality. The staff was courteous and helpful and security was evident such as checking at the elevators in the evening to make sure you had a room key card. We were able to walk to our chosen restaurants, shows and attractions. While this hotel could be somewhat costly normally, our rate was reasonable and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
143,1789,"Mar 2 2009 	Quality and location	We booked into the Crowne Plaza for the last weekend of February. The room on the 21st floor was clean and spacious with a view south into Times Square and west to the Hudson River.Staff was friendly and everything was as described. (Before checking in, I jokingly pointed to the advertisement of the Crowne Plaza rooms on the outside wall on Broadway and said that it was ours but it wasn't too far off!)Only complaint was the $19.50 charge for internet access. Sorry but that's outrageous.Now is a great time to visit New York City."
144,1789,"Feb 27 2009 	Refurbished tourist hotel	This hotel has recently been through a thorough refurbishment, and it does show that thay have spent quite a few dollars. The rooms are generally attractive, with comfortable inviting furniture and pleasant color scheme. Large wide screen tv and nice amenities add just a hint of luxury feel. As in several New York hotels, the rooms are not particularly large, and despite the refurbishment, plumbing and bathroom utilities work no better than before. Wireless internett is available, but somewhat expencive, just like the room rates themselves. Around USD 275,- including the many add ons and taxes.The walls are not particularly thick, and if you get a room with connecting doors, you her absolutely everything that goes on in the adjacent room, and vice versa. The location is absolutely superb for tourists, and the area is packed with out of town visitors. Noisy crowded, just like many prefere when visiting Manhattan. Friendly staff, mostly, but check-in and check-out takes long time (for some reason) and can produce very long lines at times.Room service was efficient, but surprisingly mediocre food. Much what one would expect in a diner hamburger restaurant.Greesy food with no refinement at all, and apparantly not too concerned with either counting calories or offering fresh vegetables. Enormous portions, not particularly apetizing.There is a decent gym which is also used by locals. The first floor bar also seems quite busy and looks like any semi-trendy hotel bar does. Seems popular and a pleasant place to sit down for an aperitif, and look down on the busy streets.All in all; great location for tourists, comfortable modernized rooms, relatively expencive. Not particularly classy or posh, but inviting and pleasant."
145,1789,"Feb 21 2009 	Love the location and view	I have stayed with family and friends several times at the Crowne Plaza mainly because of its great location and the ability to use my priority club points for a free nights stay. I have to say up until my last visit the service was great but my previous trip made me think I will pursue other options on my next visit to the city. The staff at check in was very rude and told me my room wasn't ready even though it was past check in time. I was told I could have a smaller room now or wait an hour for the room I had reserved. I decided to wait but unfortunately it took about 3 hours and a request for a manager before I actually got the room I had reserved. Our room was great and had a wonderful view so I am glad that we waited for it. I love New York but when you are paying almost $ 400 a night for a room, service should be at the top of the list!"
146,1789,"Feb 20 2009 	Great New Years Stay Excellent Location	We stayed here over the New Year by which time all of the hotel work had finished. As we were staying on Priority Points it was free fro the week but if I had paid the cheapest rate would have cost $4800 in total. The hotel location can not be beaten in the centre of Time Sq with lots in walking distance or only a short tube ride away. The hotel common areas are clean and modern and the rooms are newly refitted including the bathrooms. Our room didn't have a great view but we could see a part of the Hudson but as we not looking out of the window that often it didn't matter. On NYE the hotel was packed and so was all the area around it, don't expect to stay here and see anything of the festivities you have to go out 5 hours before to even have a chance and in the bone chilling sub zero temps it's best avoided. My only complaint is the room service food is so poor and overpriced! I had a club sandwich, bowl of fries and a carrot cake and it was $48. If it was decent I wouldn't have minded but it was cold and tasteless and the carott cake was as long and wide as 2 fingers.If I was paying I would stay at a cheaper hotel as the rooms are nice but not worth the rates they charge, they are for the location not the standard of the hotel."
147,1789,"Feb 19 2009 	Excellent Spot	Book through lowcostny.com for brilliant rates! Hotel is superbly placed and rooms are excellent and clean. Coffee machine and LCD tv. Bar is quite happening but drinks expensive but so is most alcohol in ny. Buy beer and wine from nearby drug store and there are ice machines on every floor. The staff are friendly and not in your face. You can sit in the bar and play games with your kids no one minds. I saw teenage groups bring in macdonalds and eating it in the bar area! If you want to use th pool bring your own swim caps. They are a must and they charge $25 a cap! The pool and gym are free in off peak hours which is all weekend and certain times during the day. Visit cosmic dinner on 8th avenue behind hotel for breaky or even cheaper is cafe28 on corner of 28th street. All the locals go here. $5 or less will get you a great breakfast. A big must is visit grand central station. Unbelievable. Visited last day and wished had gone sooner. It is a world in itself. Full of happening restaurants, fresh oyster bars, shops. Spend 1/2 day here and eat here. It is probably one of the best vibes going for lunch.Must do's in NY. Book a food tour in greenwich village. 3hrs and lots of fun and food. Kids are cheaper but get the same as adults! Visit the sony tech wonder lab but go first day and book your visit. It is free but don't be disaapointed like us by not ralising that you cannot just turn up. Staying in Crowne Plaza you can walk almost anywhere. We only used the subway to get to seapoint and staten island ferry.Rockerfeller observatory far better than empire state building and has three outside levels to view the skyline."
148,1789,Feb 18 2009 	Best hotel for the price	I had to stay 3 extra nights in New York due to an extended business trip and decided to stay at The Crowne Plaza as it had a good location and the price was right. I have been used to New York prices as I have been coming to New York for the past three years on business so when I booked the hotel I was expecting your basic hotel and WOW was I shocked!!!! The room was huge by New York standards and the staff was very friendly. Check-in was quick and easy but most of all this hotel has a pool in the fitness center. You do have to pay for the use of the gym which I thought should be free but once you get in it is well worth it. If someone is looking for a great hotel that is in a good location and easy and comfortable I would say stay at the Crowne Plaza you can't go wrong!!!
149,1789,"Feb 17 2009 	WAY Overpriced and too crowded	The only reason I stayed at this hotel as opposed to a less expensive hotel in NYC is because Holiday Inn's Priority Club rewards program is total BS when they say you can use your rewards night points anytime, anywhere. I tried to book every single Holiday Inn brand hotel in NYC during the Christmas shopping season and they told me I couldn't use my rewards points for a free night at any of them because the Christmas season was called a 'special event' and 'special event nights' at hotels can be blocked from people using their rewards nights at a hotel. This was even though the hotels had availability for guests who wanted to pay for the room. When I explained that 'no blackout dates' in their marketing should mean just what it said ... they explained that I wasn't being shut out of a hotel because it was a 'blackout' ... I was being shut out because it was a 'special event'. The 'special event just happened to last every weekend for 2 months. Which is basically the same thing, in my opinion. If a hotel has vacancies that you are not allowed to book using a reward night because a paying guest might want to book the room, that is a black out night.Anyways ... after Priority Club refused to bend on this policy, they asked me if I would like to book a room and pay for it since they would not allow me to use points for the entire month of December. I ended up getting a 'special rate' of $275 for the Crown Plaza because I complained so much. The normal rate was around $450 per night, which is absolute highway robbery. I realize it is Manhatten during the holidays, but still ... I'd get a room with a dinner in the restaurant at the Ritz in Boston during the holiday season for what this hotel charges for a single night. The lobby is huge and crowded with people. You cannot even walk through the lobby without moving between groups of people. Check in took almost a half hour. There were about 8 - 10 check in stations and about 3-4 people actually doing check in.The valet parking was expectedly overpriced for a hotel in this area. I'd say a night's valet charges for a car were about $20 more expensive than some of the non-name brand hotels, like the Wellington. In fact, you would be able to get a hotel in Connecticut and take the train into the city for around the same price of ONLY THE VALET COST for a two night stay at the Crown Plaza in Manhatten.WARNING ... The self park process is VERY confusing at this hotel. I decided to self park the car in the hotel's garage and asked the doorman where the parking garage was. He told me I'd have to go up 3 or 4 streets and make a U-Turn. When I did, I pulled into the parking garage that it seemed he told me about. I asked the attendent if this was the Crown Plaza parking and he said 'Yes. People from the Crown Plaza park here.' When I checked out, I found out that even though this was the closest lot to the hotel and seemed to be the place the doorman had given me directions to, this was not in fact the Crown Plaza's lot. They tried to charge me almost $200 for 2 nights worth of parking. The Crown's lot was one street over. Luckily, it turns out the hotel workers have a special rate set up for that garage since it is closer to the hotel than the actual Crown Plaza parking garage and the hotel manager was actually able to call over and tell them to give me the worker's rate, which was $25 per night, so it worked out ... but cost me about an hour's worth of time.The actual hotel is very big. There is a mix of business travelers and tourists at the hotel. The lobby is very big and has a few seating areas. It is usually very crowded. Elevators are a bit slow because there are so many floors and so many people staying there.The rooms are small ... which for Manhatten is understandable (even at $450 per night.) The decorations in the room were fairly neutral. I seem to remember a lot of yellow and off-white. It didn't really feel great compared to the decor of some of the other hotels. However, unlike a few of the comparable hotels (Sheraton, Marriott, etc.) this is not located right in Times Square, although it is a very short walk to Times Square and a fairly easy walk to Rockafeller Center and Fifth Avenue if you know where you are going. The location is pretty central to the touristy stuff ... if you are planning on doing some of the trendy areas such as Soho or the East Village ... plan on a pretty long cab ride. This hotel is probably more for tourists who want to see Times Square and Broadway.I will agree that the hot water situation is pretty annoying. There are times where you wake up in the morning and will have to take a lukewarm shower because there are so many other floors. The view from the room wasn't great ... it was another very tall building and a crane. I am not sure that any room has a good view as it is kind of in the middle of a few tall buildings.The service is bad ... maybe because it is so crowded. I will agree that most of the people who are working there seem snooty. The front desk person was fairly matter of fact and I didn't feel like anyone went out of their way to welcome me. It almost seemed like I was an annoyance as a guest and there were a few times I had to ask for things several times before anybody did anything about it. The maids were very friendly and most times said hello or greeted us when we saw them in the hallway.I probably wouldn't stay here again. For the price that the room normally cost, it is not worth it. I would rather stay at the Sheraton or Marriott which are right in Times Square and would probably be easier to find with a car ... and the staff probably isn't as rude.On a side note, since my experience with the bogus black out dates ... and having to pay $250 for a room I should have been able to use Priority Club Reward points to get when there was vacancy in the hotel for potential paying customers ... I have cut down on my Holiday Inn stays substantially. I now split my stays between Holiday Inn and Sheraton for business and personal travel because Sheraton doesn't have as many shady exclusions for their free nights, even if it is harder to earn points with Sheraton."
150,1789,"Feb 9 2009 	Amazed by the friendliness	My husband and I arrived at around 1pm and the check in took all our details and said the room would be ready at 3pm. Great, we left our bags with the bell boys and went for lunch.We returned at 3.30pm and the room still was not ready and so we were offered an upgraded room on the 43rd floor! This was a dream as we wanted the best views and boy did we get them! The room was massive with a 'chez long', a king size bed (the worlds most comfortable bed ever), a very large LCD TV, an excellent coffee/tea maker, ample storage and the bathroom was fully equipped and had a giant walk in shower. It was all heaven. The concierge were exceptionally helpful with recommendations of restaurants, directions and other points of interest - they were falling over themselves to be helpful. Other reviews found the hotel to be rude in general....we found every single employee of Crowne Plaza to be warm, friendly and exceptionally efficient. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to everyone....in fact I don't believe you could get a better hotel for the money anywhere. 10/10."
151,1789,Feb 3 2009 	Good size rooms close to Time Square	Very good location for this hotel with nice room with good size. The bathrooms are also nice although the water was not very hot and you had to wait for 5 minutes before the water would get hot. Also there is no mini bar in the rooms.
152,1789,"Feb 1 2009 	Great Hotel	Stayed here for two nights, mid January 2009. I can confirm that the renovations have finished. I didn't eat, drink or use the fitness club and swimming pool so can't comment on these.I used my Priority Club rewards points and the only room that was available online was a two double bedded smoking room, but when we checked in a nice two double bedded non-smoking room was offered and accepted from the polite and friendly check in desk clerk. The room was on the 25th Floor overlooking Broadway and Times Square, so was great to be in the centre of it all on my first trip to the US and New York.The room was spacious, clean and a good size, beds were comfy, although a little high if you are 5ft tall (I'm not so it was fine).This hotel is just right if you want to experience being right in the centre of everything and I would definitely recommend it."
153,1789,"Jan 30 2009 	Large room with a GREAT view!	I stayed here for one night of my 3-night trip to New York City in January. Check-in was smooth. Our room, although large by New York standards, had obviously not been vacuumed prior to our arrival, but it had been cleaned in every other way - the sheets were changed, the bathroom spotless, etc. Fortunately, the previous guest didn't get very much on the floor. The room was nicely decorated, and we had a great view of Times Square. A bar in the lobby has a nice selection of single malt scotches, and I enjoyed trying a few I hadn't had before.Overall, I would definitely stay here again!"
154,1789,"Jan 29 2009 	Great hotel	I really like this hotel, not only is it perfectly located with great views down into the heart of Times Square but the newly renovated rooms are extremely good quality. Spacious and warmly decorated, with excellent quality furnishings, the room was immediately welcoming and the bed was lusciously comfortable.As with any Times Square hotel, the food was expensive. Even on expenses I could not bring myself to pay the extortionate room service prices and, hence, they lost revenue to better value eating places nearby. Having said that, the public bar and restaurant are comfortable, modern and have great atmosphere and the service was excellent.However, my usual gripe (here we go again) 20 bucks a day for internet? Purleeze! First similar quality hotel in the same area to provide it free wins all my future business. Is it really worth losing a Crowne Plaza Platinum guest for the sake of $20? When all businesses are looking for an edge over their competitors, this is surely the easiest thing to give, especially to so-called valued guests especially when your hotel is half-empty.Vent over. It's a great hotel, stay there!"
155,1789,"Jan 20 2009 	Lose the Attitude	Someone needs to remind this hotel that although it is in NYC, it is still a Crowne Plaza. The staff was rude. I was here for a business meeting and as a seasoned traveler (especially to NYC at Christmas), I was very disappointed. I strongly recommend against this hotel, especially if you are planning a meeting."
156,1789,Jan 19 2009 	fantastic location	I took my daughter to NYC for just a quick weekend to celebrate her golden birthday (11). I picked the Crowne Plaza for location but the price was fantastic too! It took awhile for them to get a room for us at checkin..we had to check back a couple of times but the lady at the desk gave us a great room. We had a corner that overlooked Time Square and it was the best! We did that &quot;red bus&quot; tour and there was a stop right by us plus everything was in walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.
157,1789,"Jan 9 2009	Great stay at the Crowne Plaza	My wife and I stayed here from December 7th to 12th as part of our honeymoon. First off, location, location, location! Our room was on the 17th floor overlooking Times Square. Originally we were put in a corner room on the 34th which had superb views. However, it was a little too high up for me so we asked to be moved to a lower floor. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and had no problem with the move.The room itself was fantastic. Views onto Times Square, quiet, plenty of room for shopping with plenty of room to spare, Flatscreen TV(which stopped working on the second day but was fixed within 15 mins. Again, fair play to the staff.)The room was very clean and the maid called every day with the room left spotless.Check in and out was quick and easy. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the service was, again, fantastic.The only minor problem was the price. It was a bit over the top, but I think thats just Manhattan. I'd definitely stay here again.PS The fact that Hershey's is stuck to the GF of the hotel is also a big plus in my book :-)"
158,1789,Jan 3 2009 	Crowne Plaza	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza from Dec. 26 - Jan. 2. When we first arrived there were a few people in the lobby checking in and some checking out. Checking in was prompt and easy although they did not give us the room upgrade we were guaranteed. They told us that it was not allowed and that the only upgrade was a suite and they don't upgrade to suites.It was really close to everything but I don't recommend staying there for new years. After everyone had left times square there was a line outside the door in the 15 degree weather to get in because of the elevators were crowded. Only one person at a time was allowed to walk up the escalator which was on running so they were basically stairs. When I asked the a staff member a question I was quickly ignored and told I needed to go to the back of the line.When my boyfriend had called the night before we were supposed to check out he told them we wanted late check out for about 2 which was no problem but at 12 pm the next day they called and asked us if were checking out at 12. When we finally got to checking out we were in line for about 5 minutes when everyone at the front desk was in the phone.There was quite a line building up behind us.Finally one lady got off the phone and some girl behind us cut and so we said something and they told us that we need to wait our turn.My overall experience was good except for the last few days.
159,1789,"Jan 3 2009 	Lovely decor clean 	I stayed at this hotel from 26th Dec - 1st Jan with 2 of my girl pals &amp; we had a wonderful time!When we arrived, our room wasn't ready, (1 room with 2 double beds), but they put us in a big room which had a king size bed with ensuite (the shower was amazing!), a lounge area, a kitchen &amp; another toilet. They brought up a decent put-you-up bed almost straight away, so that we all had enough beds &amp; advised us not to unpack, as they would put us in our proper room the next day, which true to their word, they did.They also offered us a free breakfast for the next morning as compensation, which was lovely &amp; really hit the spot! We didn't have meal included in our holiday package, so this was a real bonus. The breakfast included hot food (which I would say is more catered for American taste), but still lovely &amp; the sausages were better than in the UK. There was also cereal, fruit, yoghurt &amp; pastries. Tea/coffee/juice are brought to your table by waiter/waitress. The tea is quite weak, (&amp; I drink weak tea anyway!), so take your own teabag! But I found that all tea in NYC was like this, just like the mediteranian really.The lifts/elevators were never really that busy &amp; only once did we wait for a second one, as the first was too busy. But the lifts were super quick when your in them &amp; your ears pop as there are 40 plus floors within the hotel!Our room was very clean &amp; the decor was lovely! The maid service was daily &amp; if they knock &amp; you're not ready, they will come back later, even after lunchtime if you like to sleep in, so very flexible. If you put the do not disturb sign outside the door, they don't knock.I thought the location was great, as you're so close to everything. I'd recomend going on a sightseeing bus, (even though a lot is within walking distance if you're reasonably fit), as I found them very infomative, but make sure you wrap up well in winter months, as it can get very chilly! There are numerous stops near all of the main sites &amp; you can hop on &amp; off as you like for the 2 or 3 days you book it for, which is very handy.The queues/lines to get into Empire State/Statue of Liberty boat are endless &amp; you may possibly lose the will to live! But might be better at another time of year, I don't know. We also booked a trip to the Woodybury Common shopping outlet for $40. I think it was about 1hr coach ride. It's all designer prices for less, but still quite expensive, so only worth going to if you have over $140 to spend at the minimum.The concierge at the hotel was helpful with their advice of sightseeing. They advised the Friends tour is pointless, as there's not much to see anymore &amp; the Sex in the City tour is just really the restaurants they go to, so again not worth it.The cost of an Amaretto &amp; diet coke (my favourite tipple!), at the hotel bar was $14, so very expensive. But that was on New Years Eve, so that may have been why, I'm not sure.We went ice skating in Central Park, which was wonderful &amp; we didn't queue for very long at all, so I'd recommend that.New York is a fantastic place &amp; I'd like to go back again during summer months.Times Square is manic! The streets are so packed &amp; we linked arms, so we didn't lose eachother. The shops were very busy, (perhaps just the time of year though). Unless you're a New Yorker, there's no way you could drive on those streets, as they have their own rules! Take a taxi if you need to get about.If you are buying some NY souvenirs, such as T-shirts for example, make sure you barter, as you can end up getting a t-shirt priced up as $17 for $10.If you're from the UK, be prepared that you have to tip 16-20% for everything! Sometimes 8% tax is included &amp; other times it's added when you go to pay for something. So $100 meal/drink round costs more like 128!"
160,1789,"Jan 1 2009 	We had only one complaint!	It was our first trip to NYC. My wife, two daughters and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza and we really enjoyed our stay. The only complaint that we had was that because of the large amount of people staying there on occasion there was a long wait for the elevators. We were on the 41st floor and the view was great! If you want to be in the middle of everything this is the place to stay. The rooms were very comfortable. Don't listen to the negative comments, you won't be disappointed.Ottinger Family,Greeneville Tennessee"
161,1789,"Dec 31 2008 	Excellent location and very comfortable!!!	We stayed on the 42nd floor and we were very pleased with our room. Arriving early certainly helps! We arrived at 9:30 am and were given our room straight away. Later in the day we noticed huge lines and people slugged over chairs looking a little dismayed. My only issue was the cleaning staff that knocked on our door at 9am to do their servicing. This was a bit early for us after a night of city exploration!!!!The beds and linens were amazing. We were torn between sleeping in late and getting out to get a head start on the city (before the intense crowds during that time). We loved coming back to our hotel room to lovely music left by the housekeeping staff.It was expensive, but given the local-worth it!"
162,1789,"Dec 31 2008	Poorly Managed poor service decent room	Between the week of Christmas and New Year's 2008 my family was in NYC to see some sights, and catch a show. We stayed at the Crowne Plaza. A hotel that alleges four star service, but in our experience did not deliver at all. Over the course of six hours, the first time being an hour prior to check-in (so understandable) we were turned away repeatedly, despite reservations for a fortieth floor room. We were told our room was not ready. Everyone in the lobby was being told their rooms were not ready again, over the course of hours. I can only assume housekeeping was comprised of one person. Each time required a wait from ten to twenty minutes in a line often as deep as six parties. In order to finally be given a room key (so that we could meet friends for dinner, as scheduled) was by insisting that another room was made available. It was inferior to the one we booked, no compensation offered. The staff was curt, and often rude. Management loitered nearby but did nothing. Guest services were non-existent. Staff was rude. The concierge was unable to answer a very simple question. Give this a hotel a pass if you are looking for anything resembling guest services. Save your money and stay at a cheaper place, you'll get the same level of service. Or spend it somewhere where the service warrants the fee. It doesn't here, at all. The only reason this review isn't &quot;terrible&quot; is because the actual room was clean, if small."
163,1789,"Dec 29 2008 	Great location lots of glitches	Had a confirmed booking for two double beds (for family with 2 small kids). Ended up with a king bed. They promised a rollaway bed which didn't arrive until reminded at midnight. This then appeared without an apology. A lot of others at the crowded check-in seemed to be having all sorts of problems with their rooms. Maybe this was because of the season - this was December 26, 2008.The location, however is fantastic. The room was clean and moderately spacious, and the view was incredible.The bathroom was modern and nice. The housekeeping was good (except for a plate of half-eaten food that did not get cleared from outside our room for 10 daytime hours).The TV had terrible reception."
164,1789,"Dec 24 2008 	More just a room than a hotel	I booked 2 rooms for 5 nights for a family trip and stayed on the 23rd floor. Reason for choosing was because of the central location. In fact, I found Times Squre a little too busy for my taste and would have preferred somewhere a little quieter. The room was comfortable with a good quality bed. But thats all you are getting for your $500 a night. The hotel has no atmosphere, no presence, its just a very expensive room to sleep in, in the city of the permanently outstretched hand."
165,1789,"Dec 20 2008 	Perfect Trip - perfect hotel	My family (wife and 12 year old boy) stayed here near xmas and did up the NYC xmas atmosphere. The hotel was perfectly placed in the heart of Times Square to thrill my boy and for us to quickly access all of what we wanted. The hotel was clean and friendly and lived up to 4-stars in all ways. The beds were comfortable with rich linen and coverings, the bathroom lovely. It was a good size (for NY) and we had a incredibly great view from the 44th floor (club level). If you kick in the extra for club/exec level you get higher floor and a terrific continental breakfast. Excellent coffee, breakfast breads and pastries, graclox, cheeses....The one goof they made was that on the second day they ran out of regular coffee for the in-room coffee pot (leaving only decaf). They apologized and immediately (w/i 10 minutes) got us the coffee bags and gave us vouchers which upgraded us to full hot breakfast in the hotel restaurant. ($20 a head!) Beware: They are doing work on the entrance. It is hard to find! Go around to 49th instead of trying to get in on Broadway."
166,1789,"Dec 18 2008 	Westoner Loved The Crown	Simply superb hotel with fantastic location. without a shadow of doubt the Crown Plaza has to be the very best that my wife and I have been guests, and we are sure to return sometime in 2009."
167,1789,"Dec 18 2008 	Stay Somewhere Else - Terrible Experience!	Our rooms were on the 42th floor and had a great view. However, the room felt like a hot house the entire time. I called about the heat 3 times, over a 3 day period. They said they couldn't adjust the heat nor did they offer to move us to another room. Finally on the 3rd day and insisting to speak to the Manager I was offered a $30 coupon that was good for the breakfast area or the bar. It was a $500+ per night room and I my family had two rooms. That's over $1,000 per night. At that point I was greatly offended and refused the $30 coupon offer. The only way to lower the heat was to open up the window, put a rolled up magazine in it to keep it open, open the room door, prop it open with a trash can to create a cross ventilation. I actually pulled the blow dryer out in the hallway to dry my hair so I wouldn't feel like I was dying of heat stroke.Trying to sleep at night in the heat was miserable.The Breakfast buffet is grossly overpriced. 4 people with a 15% tip was $153. We paid about that much for dinner at very nice restaurants.Due to renovations, the only way into the hotel is though the back.I will not return to this hotel. There are several hotels in this area that are FAR BETTER."
168,1789,"Dec 14 2008 	Would Take A Lot To Beat It!!!	We stayed here Dec 5 to 9 2008.and were a bit worried after reading earlier reviews.We arrived early and were checked in and asked to return for our room key at 3pm as stated, no problemo!The room was immaculate as was the whole hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly and our corner room on the 43rd floor made our stay amazing. The hotel was clean, tidy and except slight works ongoing on the front door area the renovations are all complete. There was no noise or dirt from the front door works and the back door is so grand that you don't really worry about it. THE TURNDOWN SERVICE AND NIGHTLY WEATHER FORECAST WERE A BONUS IN THE ROOM AND IT HAS THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR A GREAT STAY IN THE BIG CITY.10/10"
169,1789,"Dec 10 2008 	Great Location! -- Modern accommodations!	We lived in NYC for 10 years until we moved to LA three years ago.Every time we visited, we stayed with family or friends, but this time we wanted to stay at a hotel. Through Expedia.com we booked airfare and hotel for less than $1000/person for 7nights stay. First of all, the accommodation was great! We had room 3416 which faced the 49th street and Broadway. The corner room made the room feel a bit chilly on first two nights, when the temp. hit the 20s. The room was cleaned satisfactorily each day, although there was no vacuuming the entire time. We could have used at least once or twice during our 7 night stay. We had a nice view of the Macy's thanksgiving parade coming down Broadway. But the best part of this hotel is the convenience of LOCATION. The location cannot be beat. You literally have access to three different subway stops with less than two blocks away (1/9, A/C/E, N/R). So, I definitely would recommend that you get a week pass or a daily subway pass. You will definitely use them a lot. Plus, walking around mid town is so easy staying here.I also loved the NY Sports Club right in the building on the 15th floor. It also has a rare NYC commodity which is an indoor pool. I used it three times while I was there. If you want, you could reserve the lane in advance.A few down side was, the TV reception wasn't great for some reason. Especially CNN was unwatchable. But we weren't in NYC to watch TV right? The front desk or services in general that required human touch was a bit lacking. So, don't expect Four Season services there. The escalator kept on breaking for some reason, so the high volume traffic to the street level was led to this one elevator. The concierge service was pathetic. When I asked about the big apple circus show, this guy began typing something on his computer. When it took much longer than I expected, I asked him to simply call me up in the room when he found the availability. He said that he was leaving because the concierge desk closes at 10pm. It was only 9:30pm. Again, he had no two crossed keys on his lapel, so don't expect Four Season services. The room is small, but it's comfortable. Overall, we had a great time. We would stay there again."
170,1789,"Dec 10 2008 	Nice Location-Working at getting at together!!	My family stayed at the Crown Plaza for Thanksgiving. We arrived Wednesday and stayed untill the Sat. after Thanksgiving. Locaton cant be beat! They gave us an ealy check in, which was great! The renovations were not done as it says on the web site. As I have said in earlier reviews, my husband stays on business so we like to save up points and then use them to stay in a nice hotel. I think they gave us the &quot;you are using points floor&quot;. It didnt appear to be done and our view was of a ash roof!! Now, according to the rewards program if a nicer room is available we are to be upgraded. Not here!! Was told NO NO!! Well, we got to room and went to site see. Thats what we came for, not to complain about our room. After running around all day it was nice to come back and relax. Lobby looks really nice. Bars are very expensive, everything is in NYC. A glass of wine and a beer about $20.00. Nice location to see the Macys parade,go shopping, Rockafeller Center, everything. I had a few problems like my husband birthday was on Friday the 28th and was susposed to have a cake delivered at 3:00 . Room wasnt cleaned and no cake. This was to be a surprise. That was ruined. The front desk manager called to the food service and first said there was no cake and then it &quot;fell apart&quot;. SO AFTER ABOUT TWO HOURS OF CHASING AROUND THE CAKE IT SHOWED UP. I was told by a staff member they have been through 3 managers in a few months. The right does not know what the left is doing here. They did comp the cake after all of that. That was the right thing to do. Thanks! When we checked out my husband tried to talk to the front desk Priority Club lady, she didnt even want to hear about anything. My husband gave up we paid our bill which included parking and we went down to get our car&gt; Final kick in the behind, we owed more money to get our car out. We had just checked out 2 minutes before and then went down stairs and we owed 12 more dollars. My husband was told to go back upstairs but by this time we had had IT!! I guess if you are using your points to stay here, dont expect much. I bet if you are paying top dollar it would be much better. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. I have stayed at Crown Plaza and better properties before, in Key West and The Willard in DC and was treated the same as if I was paying cash. Do not expect that here. We felt like second class citizens even though my husband stays in these properties paying full corporate price a gazillion times a year !! I hope they get this place together. Because it could be really nice."
171,1789,"Dec 9 2008 	SHOCKING !!!!!!	Shocking as in static electricity!! Everytime we touched a door handle, an elevator button or escalator we got an electric shock!We booked this hotel for a 5 night Xmas Shopping break for early December 2008.When we arrived the main entrance was undergoing some renervation therefore we had to use the rear entrance to access the hotel. The concierge were located near the entrance door and made no effort whatsoever to help us with our bags so we had to lug them to the room ourselves.The check in process was simple and quick and the lobby/bar/restaurant area's are all very clean and modern looking.We were allocated a king size corner room on the 40th floor which was well decorated and in good order although we had a few niggles such as no bathrobes, no replacement tea/coffee/water during the entire duration and a heating system that liked to squeal like a pig whilst you tried to sleep. We tried the restaurant one evening and the food was acceptable although they showed a football game in the restaurant bar so we had to constantly listen to the viewers/supporters yelling and screaming throughout our meal. No attempt was made to calm them down even though we made a few remarks to restaurant staff.On a final note if you intend to sit by the window in the restaurant or Bar area wear a coat as its very cold !"
172,1789,"Dec 7 2008 	Great Time in Times Square	We decided earlier this year for a first time visit to Times Square in Manhattan. We read the mixed reviews and still chose the Crowne Plaza on Broadway and 49th right in the heart of Times Square.Although the front of the hotel is undergoing renovation the remainder of the construction is complete and the renovation was not noticable from a visitor standpoint.I made the reservation in April of 2008 for a stay on December 5-7, 2008. This was our first trip to Times Square and we will definately return soon...and stay at this hotel!A little about our trip experience... We called a few weeks ahead of time and had the Concierge make reservations at Blue Fin restaurant (Food was good, little pricey).Our room was a King bed with a 36&quot; HD TV. There were about 30 channels to choose from including HBO, Fox News, CNN, Nickoloden, Weather Channel, etc... The bedding was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The ONE negative I had was that the hotel charged 9.95 a day for internet access through the TV and a laptop connection was not an option. I carried my laptop and used my cell modem and had a great connection.Extra info...there are very few convienance stores in the area. We actually shipped a box of cokes and snacks so that we wouldn't have to use room service for such things. It cost $11.00 to ship a 13lb box with all of our goodies and they were waiting on us when we checked in. If you DO need something from a small grocery store, there is one located 2 short blocks to the east on 7th Avenue and 48th street that sells just about anything that you can imagine. A beer at the store was $1.50 versus $9.00 at the hotel bar. Also, being an ex-smoker I also noticed the price of cigarettes were $10.25 per pack!!!!....Great reason to stop smoking in itself.Overall we had a great first time trip to New York and will return in the near future."
173,1789,"Dec 7 2008 	What a great hottel	My wife and I just returned from NY and while in Manhattan we staryed at the Crowne Plaza. This is a great hotel. Friendly staff, perfect location (Times Square), very clean. Our first two nights we stayed at the Fairmont &quot;Plaza Hotel&quot;, however at half the cost and double the advantages the &quot;Crowne Plaza&quot; was the best choice. When we return to NY we will be staying at the Crowne Plaza. You will not be disapointed."
174,1789,"Dec 6 2008	Great Location!	The room was spacious, clean and recently refurbished. Service was excellent! Buffet breakfast was really nice. Great location, couldn't have asked for anything more!"
175,1789,"Dec 5 2008 	Loved the hotel	Despite what other reviews had said in past i found the crown plaza hotel to be excellent. All of the renovations completed and its just lovely. The lobby and bar area are very warm and welcoming.I found the front office staff more than helpfull and went out of there way to accommodate.We arr around 11pm on Fri night and prob with our room, we asked for high floor, corner room and got room 4201 which looked right down times square it was amazing.The rooms were very nicely renovated and the beds were luxury it was possibly the most comfortable bed ever stayed in.evan the bathroom had been renovated which most hotels seem to overlook this. Only strange thing in hotel and all prop stayed that no mini bar fridge in room.Oh well.. On each end of hotel block is are 24hr drug stores which just sell everythig, starbucks right outside hotel and half tix 20 meteres from hotel as well asall other food outlets possible.Would def recommend this hotel to others and stay here again."
176,1789,Nov 30 2008 	Great hotel	We stay here for 4 nights and it was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and our room was cleaned everyday before 11:00 am. I was a little worried after reading the reviews but it was a great hotel and we got to watch the parade right in front of the hotel. They are still remodeling and the front entrance is not opened yet but the rest of the hotel was very nice. It is right in time square which was great to be right in front of everything.
177,1789,"Nov 30 2008 	Good location but disappointing	My partner had booked this whole trip as a surprise for my 50th birthday. We arrived at the hotel at around 9 pm after problems with our limo from Newark.When we arrived at the entrance i got the impression that as soon as the doorman spotted our luggage wasn't suitcases or designer versions, he didn't seem bothered to help us and was very dismissive. We made our way to the check in desk and found the receptionist chirpy and helpful. She informed us that we had a twin queen bed room on the 29th floor, despite the fact that my partner had booked a kingsize on a floor between the 30th and top floor to ensure the best views. We decide to check out the room anyway as there are queues building up behind us.We get to the room to find it is a disabled room with two fairly small double beds and a small room with great views. Do we stay in it just because it has good views?? We are very tired and my partner is not happy as it's not what he's paid for. So we head off back to the reception to sort it out. The staff were extremely unhelpful. The guy who initially helped us was polite and seemed positive about being able to sort things out. He goes off to speak to his superior (a guy who definitely didn't have an American accent) who was totally obnoxious and very unhelpful. After we both got a bit agitated with him, especially by his bad attitude, he agreed to try to move us to a higher floor with a king bed tomorrow. We are unable to pack until we are moved but are assured that if we go out tomorrow our bags will be moved to the new room by 2 pm.We get back at 4pm the following day after a long day sightseeing only to find that yet another new receptionist doesn't know what we're talking about. We can feel ourselves getting mad. Eventually she tells us that we have been moved to the 32nd floor and it has a king bed but she says we'll have to get our bags from the other room. We flatly refuse and insist that they are moved as we were promised they would be.Bigger better room but the views aren't that good. We can't be bothered to make a fuss and we found it quite noisy overlooking Times Square so we stay put.The Concierge staff were helpful. The parlour maid was sweet and chatty but the doormen and bar staff had bad attitudes and were unhelpful. The bar itself was very cold. On the two occasions we used it we had to sit in our coats, hats, scarves and gloves it was so cold.If the staff had better attitudes and you could guarantee you'd get what you'd actually booked, we would probably give it another try. It is in a great location, handy for everything. Such a shame the staff lets it down."
178,1789,"Nov 24 2008 	Awesome location and beautiful hotel!!!	My wife and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Nov 14 2008- 17. The location of the hotel is in the heart of Times Square, and is close to all subway connections. The hotel also has 24 hour room service, and the lobby was amazing. This was my second time in NYC, but it was my wifes first time and she loved it. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the city. Make sure you check Priceline because they have awesome packages for this hotel!!!"
179,1789,"Nov 23 2008 	Best Location Ever!	I stayed here for four nights with a friend - we asked for a twin room, which was two queen size beds. We had a view overlooking Broadway and Times Square and could not have had a better location. 2 minute walk to subway, a very safe area to stay, even for two women to walk back to their hotel late at night. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and will be staying again!"
180,1789,"Nov 20 2008 	Very average hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. It was still being remodeled, so the entrance was through the parking lot on 49th. The staff was nor helpful nor polite. Every night every guest was asked to show their room key when entering the hotel and when approaching the elevator. The concierge was never there. The cleaning staff did not take out our trash for a few days. The doors closed with great amount of noise. Also, the noise from the street was appalling, mostly on friday and saturday nights. We asked for room service and never got it. There was no safe in the room. It took around 15 minutes to get hot water in the shower (very non-ecological). The bell boys were very insistent although I did not need any help with my one carry-on piece of luggage. I would not recommend this hotel."
181,1789,Nov 19 2008 	PERFECT Location!	We stayed here just after christmas aa few years ago and it is in the perfect location for anyone travelling to new york! Apart from anything else it is right beside the Hershey store!!!!!!!!When we first arrived our room was not ready and we were asked to come back which we did only to be told the same thing! This would not normally bother me but after 8 hours on a plane I wanted to get into my room so after returning a 3rd time my husband insisted we be given a room! In their defence they did do this and we moved to our room the next day. But in all this was a very minor complaint. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and as I have said in a perfect location! I didnt actually eat here but there are just so many places to choose from!Would stay again...hopefully!
182,1789,"Nov 15 2008	Great room perfect location	I really can't believe that this hotel only has a 3/5 rating. It's really a lot better than that! Our room was huuuuuge, you could see Times Square from it, everything was nice and new with a massive (though absurdly high) bed, and it was equipped with all the usual facilities. If you want central, it's pretty much unbeatable. You're virtually on Times Square with easy access to the theatres.Service was great, the bar is cool, but didn't try the restaurant. Don't be put off by the poor rating - this really is a nice hotel! (Especially when you get a bargain on Priceline like we did)."
183,1789,"Nov 14 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	After reading several reviews on Trip Advisor, I was a little scared of what to expect. Though still under construction, the lobby looks great and the staff was very helpful. I got there way earlier than check in time and the front desk was more than happy to give me a room. The room was spacious, with a great view...everything was really quite delightful. The location itself is pretty awesome too!"
184,1789,"Nov 13 2008 	Great Hotel - Great Location	We stayed at the Crown Plaza Times Square on a Priceline bid. We got a great deal!! However, after my bid was accepted, I read the reviews and was a little worried, but I should not have been worried.Our room was on the 29th floor and it was very nice with a view of Times Square. I was traveling with my son, so we got a room with two double beds. The room was quite large by NYC standards. The room was updated (much better than either of the two Sheratons that are near by) and clean. Everyting was in working order (although the room was a little warm, but not too bad).Check-in was fast. We arrived early and our room was not ready. The front desk handled all the paperwork and when we returned all we had to do was show a photo ID.I used the health club one morning. It is a very impressive club. There is no fee if you are a member of the Priority Club (Crown Plaza's reward program.Would stay here again any time. We loved it."
185,1789,"Nov 12 2008 	No major problems would return!	Stayed from 11/6-11/10 for $240.00 per night (Priceline). Only complaint was the temperature in the room, very hot. Requested maintenance three (3) times to open the window; you need a screwdriver to do it. Apparently, they turn the heat on when November hits. Mentioned my complaint when checking out; received a free room upgrade my next visit. Other than the above, the stay was fine. Renovations are 99% completed. Staff was pleasant and the location can't be beat."
186,1789,"Nov 11 2008	Perfect Stay--Couldn't Be Better	My family and I (4 adults) stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square for a week in early October for a sightseeing trip to NYC. We got amazing rates using the Name Your Own Price Tool on Priceline.com which I use often for all my hotel stays. I believe it came out to $1400 CAD for air/hotel from Vancouver for 7nights--great deal for such an expensive city. Most hotels in NYC run upwards of $500/night and I got the hotel for $210/night plus taxes/fees. I booked two rooms. The only problem was that it was difficult in October to book 7 nights consecutive so I booked us in the Hilton in Times Square for the initial night in NYC for the exact same rate on Priceline. Not a problem since it was close by. Out of the two the Crowne Plaza was WAY better since it was just recently renovated.We checked in at noon (after checking out of the Hilton) at the Crowne Plaza and to our pleasant surprise they had rooms ready! I had called in earlier in the week to request two beds per room and they were able to honour that. We had two beautifully renovated and spacious rooms on the 39th floor. I travel extensively for pleasure and this was by far one of the nicest rooms I've ever had. The bed was nice and comfortable and the new fixtures were modern and nice. The LCD tv was a bit complicated for my parents to use since they have a menu system, and one night my dad chose a pay-per-view movie by mistake. No problem--front desk took it off for me with no questions asked. I did not feel like I was treated differently because I booked cheap on Priceline. TIP: Treat the counter staff with respect and you will get the same back--they deal with a lot of rude people all the time and you will be surprised how nicely they will deal with your problems if you ask nicely first. The service was exemplary. Travellers need to keep an open mind as problems happen. Our room cards got deactivated somehow twice during our stay so they had to reactivate them for us. As well the concierge was good with security asking you to show your card in the evening before you went up. Only minor negatives during our stay was that the bar/lobby was not open (which didn't make a difference to us) and you don't get a mini fridge in your room. This was no problem since we just used their complimentary ice machine to keep our drinks cold. Also they only offer wifi internet if you pay for it. You can access your MSN Messenger no problem, though, and there is free limited internet access at the Tourist Centre close by in Times Square and if you are feeling desperate free wifi at the Doubletree Suites lobby nearby.TIP: There are so many duane reeds near by on almost every corner in times square: we got San Pelligrino/water/pop there for a decent price. Also lots of places to eat near by. You are in the heart of Times Square so it's convenient to hop on the subway (I recommend purchasing a one week Metro Card--so easy to use and get around). Times Square is also a very safe area since it is packed with people at most hours, which is bad if you don't like the noise and the constant crowds. I stayed in Murray Hill last year near Grand Central, and it was a lot quieter if that's what you want (see my reviews). We took the cab to and from JFK Airport with no problems--it is a flat rate plus tolls/tip. The cabbie going back was a bit sketchy, though, and he seemed unsatisfied with his tip even though I tipped him a fair 20%. I say carry a lot of ones for tipping, although the cabs DO take credit cards (they have machines installed in the back for your convenience and peace of mind). This was my 2nd trip and my family's first so I purchased the New York pass (7 days) on their website, which is usually 20% off online (www.newyorkpass.com). I recommend this as you can visit most tourist attractions on that card and it gives you $10 credit EACH day of the card for EACH card at Planet Hollywood near the hotel--that was $40 credit for 7 days-total $280 for gifts/souvenirs. 7 days was plenty of time during our stay--we even had time to hit the mall in Queens(quieter and less stressful than shopping in Manhatten) and Coney Island in lower Brooklyn. The guidebook you get with the pass is great for planning your itinerary and comes with the indispensable subway map.BTW--I was so afraid after reading those entries on the bedbugs etc (seems that NY seems to have a bit of an epidemic at some hotels)--we never saw any sign of these here. My fears were calmed right away when I saw our beautifully renovated rooms--see my pictures. Lastly--we locked up our luggage on the last night because we had a late flight. No problem at all. Tipped them a couple dollars when we locked the luggage up, and tipped another two when we picked them up. We lost nothing and the doorman went through a lot of work to hail us a cab during a very busy time. He loaded our bags in the trunk, made sure we were happy, and sent us off. Great stay! =-)I will be happy to answer questions, and let me know if you found this review helpful. Have a good trip!"
187,1789,"Nov 5 2008 	Avoid This Awful Hotel	This hotel is really a nightmare. When I checked in, I was totally disappointed by the front desk service. The hotel was being refurbished, and WE DIDNT HAVE WATER FOR ONE DAY. They gave us a bottle of Evian water to brush our teeth. I had to change the room THREE times before I got a decent one because of problems with the system. They kept on giving me rooms that either were out of service or didnt have even a bed! Crazzy, awful experience to what is called a FIVE STARS HOTEL that isnt even one star! Dont go there please, make a wiser decision with your money. The only &quot;good&quot; thing is location - location - location, and only if its your first time in manhattan, if not, youd prefer to go to another neighbourhood."
188,1789,"Nov 3 2008 	great location	Was worried about the service after reading some reviews, but all was fine. I booked direct with the hotel and had confirmation letter stating a room with 2 double beds...and this is exactly what I got. very spacious and very comfortable. Lovely bathroom. We were on the 26th floor. Front entrance off broadway is still closed for renovation so you enter from the back off either 48th or 49th. This caused no issue however. Staff were helpful and reasonably friendly. I dont think you get the cheesy Florida-friendly anywhere in NY anyway so I wasnt expecting anymore than I got. The location is fantastic. 15yr old travelling with me loved the excitement of Times Square on the doorstep. Plenty of places to eat within short walking distance of hotel. Would stay here again."
189,1789,"Oct 29 2008 	Good value at Times Square	The renovations are complete inside, and bar started to operate in the middle of our Stay.Great Location for tourism as you are in the middle of New york.Staying on the concierge floor, to be honest could not find what the difference is. ( not dedicated check in, concierge, lounge....) Maybe the bathrobe and some extra lotion!!Rooms nicely refurbinshed. Water pressure is disapointing.Choose due the great rate I got ( 289USD), comparing to other chain hotels in this area, and Breakfast ( above avarege) was included.Overall, deliver what we expected. Would Stay again for this same price!"
190,1789,"Oct 28 2008 	Great family hotel!	After having read a number of negative reviews on this site, I was a bit worried when Priceline.com assigned us the Crowne Plaza Hotel Times Square. However, we had a fantastic experience there! Hotel was very clean, my 15 year old son loved being in the center of the action in Times Square. We were up high--34th floor and so weren't bothered by any city noise. We found the hotel room very quiet, even though the hotel itself was very busy. We never heard any noise from thehall or from other rooms. The room was large, plenty of room for a king-size bed and a rollaway for our son, and also the regular room furniture, which included a chaise lounge, a desk, and a chest of drawers, including flat screen TV. Bathroom plenty roomy, with tub and shower. Bed was especially comfortable with a plush top on the mattress. Hotel staff unfailingly polite and helpful. No negatives to report. We didn't try the restaurants, but ate on the go. Would stay there again."
191,1789,"Oct 28 2008 	Stay Somewhere Else	I travel to new york city atleast 3-4 times a year and this is the worst service I have ever received in my life.We check in 10 minutes before check in time (which usually isnt a big deal anywhere else) and they tell us to come back once its actually check in time, no problem. Until I go to check back in 10 minutes later and they tell me your room is not ready so I asked how long and they tell me &quot;5 mins, 30 minutes, 1 hour, I dont know&quot; NICE ANSWER!! So we decided to leave our bags with the bellman so we could walk around times square a bit until our room was finally ready.We finally get to check in, an hour later, and our bags were nowhere to be found. I literally had to call the front desk 4 times to check where our bags were. Finally I went downstairs angry at the service and the manager assured me that my bags would be there soon. He used the walkie talkie and the bags were there about 10-15 minutes later after already waiting over an hour for them. We were in the elevator with many other angry guests as well, one who told us they had booked a large suite way ahead of time and had pre-paid for it but they couldnt get the suite they ordered because the U.N was at the hotel and they were giving their room to them instead. The rooms were okay, comfy beds and it seemed cleaned. But out of the 3 of us that stayed there I was the only one that really thought the room was decent. Great location, and probably one of the cheapest hotels you can find in nyc at a 3 star level. I stay at the Sofitel and the &quot; W &quot; usually, and I decided that I would rather pay the extra $200 a night to receive outstanding service and amazing rooms. Usually when your checking out the front desk person asks how your stay was but in this case I think they know that their service is ridiculous so they dont even bother asking. Its sad if you ask me."
192,1789,"Oct 26 2008 	Loved the Crowne Plaza Times Square	Just returned from a 5 night stay with my daughter and I can honestly say I don't think we could have found a better hotel. Clearly the hotel was towards the end of a modernisation process but apart from entering the hotel from the rear (still an impressive entrance!) there was little if any evidence or disruption. Rooms were spacious, extremely clean and had great facilities. Thought the swimming pool was fine - this was clearly marketed more as a private health club than a guest facility - but hey - you are not going to New York to swim are you. The location of the hotel couldn't have been in a better location. I spent hours of research before going and although I had seen a couple of bad reviews on this hotel I found no evidence to back these up. None of the other hotels in this price range could match the location, its central for everything the best possible place to stay. The only other hotel nearby was the Marriott Marquis and I had a quick look round whilst there and it didn't seem to be as good. I would thoroughly recommend and wouldn't hesitate to go back."
193,1789,"Oct 23 2008 	Will Be a Nice Hotel	Regardless of what the Web site says, if you've booked a room here call ahead and confirm that all the ammenities are available. Just did a three night/four day stay here. Got a great rate. The room was brand new...clean, new carpet, new shower heads, etc. But the lobby bar &amp; restaurant were not yet open, you had to enter from the garage as the facade is still being worked on, and the laundry service was available at times.The people were very nice, and the room was clean...and I think this will be a nice, mid-town hotel for those looking for more action than comfort very soon."
194,1789,"Oct 21 2008 	Great Stay/Great Staff	This was the 1st time staying in NYC, and this hotel was extremely clean (even though they are under going construction), and had the most extra friendly and very helpful staff. I am going back to NYC in November and plan on staying here again."
195,1789,Oct 21 2008 	fantastic	My husband and I stayed here this past weekend and absolutely loved it. Our room was recently renovated and was very spacious. The service was great and the location was perfect. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on it's food. We would definately stay here again!
196,1789,"Oct 20 2008 	A knight on the town.	I have an affinity for this old lump, God knows why. Ive stayed in her for many years in rooms where the door would not close, the windows would not open, the air con would only work at maximum, hot or cold, and Ive stepped around stains in the carpet which look as though something living has died and been left to rot for years.Now, my old mistress has been reborn. The recent (and ongoing) renovations have rejuvenated her and shes ready to face the 21st century. My kingsize bed is magnificent, the dcor is contempory and comfortable, the WiFi works, (as this posting demonstrates) and my view if Manhattan from the 36th floor has to be one of the best in New York.True, the reception staff greet you as though you were their adversary in a medieval joust but they soon mellow with a compliment and a kind word. After all they are only defending the honour of my lady, which you, the great unwashed, will soon besmirch."
197,1789,"Oct 20 2008 	Fantastic hotel location and staff	Hi There, We went to NYC in Sept this year to get married and we stayed here. The hotel itself was under construction so upon entering we were a little worried about what we would find. It was absolutely fantastic, we didn't have to worry about the work that was going on at all. The room they gave us had a view right down onto Times Square and the first night we stayed the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and a cheeseboard, with a note saying congratulations on our pending wedding. It was a lovely touch. There was no request too big or too small for the staff at this hotel, the whole experience for us was absolutely wonderful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a good stay."
198,1789,Oct 17 2008 	absolute crap	This is supposed to be a 4star hotel. It is rubbish. On their website they say &quot;welcome to our flagship&quot;. God help the rest if this is the best. Restaurant was only available for breakfast and no bar to have a relaxing cocktail in. All this place has going for it is the location.
199,1789,"Oct 17 2008 	Very disappointed	We chose this hotel after looking long and hard for a hotel with family rooms and facilities applicable for families travelling with children. The Crowne Plaza not only boasted family rooms with 2 double beds but also a leisure club with swimming pool so sounded perfect. When we called to book our stay, we were asked if we'd like to pay $170 extra to have a room above the 42nd floor which came with access to the executive lounge where free snacks and drinks would be available throughout the day and where the buffet breakfast would be served in the mornings. We snapped up this offer as the drinks and snacks would be ideal for our children and we looked forward to our holiday.When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that a major re-fit was underway and the executive lounge was closed, along with the bar, restaurant and even the toilets and upper lounge were out of bounds unless we were attending a conference at the hotel!! Also the pool was not available to our children or anyone under 18 yrs old which was not explained to us at the time of booking even though the booking department knew our children's ages. The only areas of the hotel which were accessible to us were the foyer, our room and the breakfast room, but only in the morning. We had to fight for a reduction in our nightly rate to reflect all the features which had been withdrawn and were also promised a food basket which arrived in our room consisting of 1 apple, 1 rotten slice of apple, 1 tiny applie pie and 1 small bottle of water..... between 4 of us!! Our room was also bathed in the glorious sound of workmen drilling during the first day of our stay, despite the manager assuring us that no work was currently being done!! There was no restaurant open so any food or drinks had to be ordered via room service which was hugely expensive and even then, took 2 visits to bring the correct order. I'm sure when the hotel is fully re-fitted and re-opened, it will be lovely but unfortunately we feel very let down by the hotel and the booking department we used, who failed to inform us of the re-fit and the impact it would have on our stay. We loved NYC but would've enjoyed it even more in another hotel. We will not be using Crowne Plaza hotels again."

Room was clean and big, good view (21st floor,corner-room).Staff was ok, but could be little more kind/friendly.First 2nights was little too cold and keycard did not work at two times (have to go reception and change).Good hotel, great location, maybe a little bit too expencive tought."
201,1789,"Oct 14 2008 	staff very rude poor service and amenities	before booking my stay at the crown plaza i checked out their webside. it said renovations were to be completed by end sept. just to be sure, i called the hotel and was told that everything is complete in the hotel with just some minor work outside. everything was fully operational. when i checked in, as a platinum member of piority club normally i get some extra benefits such as an upgrade to the exec floor and complimentary breakfast. i was told that this hotel does not recognise this status as it is upto the individual hotel. i could not believe this as i have never had a problem anywhere else before. i asked to see the manager and they were very rude and denied my request.i also discovered the resaurant was not open for dinner and the bars were also closed. i was told they were waiting for a liquor licence. i complained again to the front desk manager and this time they agree to give me a free breakfast. it was as i was begging for it and i was made to felt bad. i have read other review on different websites about this hotel and how rude the staff are. they really could not care less. i would not recommend staying at this hotel due to the attitude of the staff."
202,1789,"Oct 14 2008	Very pleasant stay	I was also worried reading negatives reviews after I had already book two rooms via priceline at 230$ a room. Our stay was perfect,the location is great, the hotel is nicely renovated, and the beds are very comfortable. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I would return anytime."
203,1789,"Oct 13 2008 	Excellent location!	One of the best features about this hotel is its location. It is only a few blocks from many Broadway theaters and Time Square. The rooms were very nice - and I've stayed in a lot of hotels. It was clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV (if you actually have time to watch TV with all the other fun stuff to do in NY). There was an array of pillows on the bed of varying firmnesses to choose from. Nicely decorated room and bathroom. During my night's stay, I heard no street noise or neighboring rooms. Light from the bright and busy streets outside was easily blocked out by the darkout shades. When I stayed there (Oct 1 2008), the entrance was a bit hard to find, as there seemed to be some construction to the building on main street. Basically, just look for the big Hershey's sign / store, and the hotel is right there (entrance just around the block, either way). The lobby for check in was on the second floor (the floor just above the ground floor) -- you can take some escalators or elevator up to it. Breakfast at the hotel is extremely pricey (wasn't included in my room rate) -- but there's plenty of breakfast options within walking distance (it's New York, after all)."
204,1789,"Oct 12 2008 	Great place	The rooms have been renovated and are clean and crisp. The front desk staff was very helpful in adressing a door lock that was suspect (slightly ajar after renovation) and a billing change that was required by my office. You are in and therefore subject to the sights and sounds of Times Square, but if you need to tune that out, they even supply a night mask, ear plugs, linen spray, etc. (thoughtful touches). I plan to return here with my wife for a pleasure trip."
205,1789,"Oct 9 2008 	Superb Hotel	Having read quite a few negative reviews here after booking the hotel, I was very worried about how the visit was going to go.Arrival was friendly, polite and swift. Checking-in was a dream and the room is perfect.Only on day one and had a very nice breakfast, which offers an extensive choice for American or Continental.The atmosphere is very relaxed.All staff, from the entrance to the lift to the waiters are all very friendly and polite.I would thoroughly recommend."
206,1789,"Oct 5 2008 	Great Value Great Room Great Location	I am staying as I write the review in October 2008.I booked a room on Priceline for $220 which is hard to find any kind of quality room in Manhattan under $300. I did not feel treated any differently than any other hotel check-in..many guests here prepay through third parties. i asked at check-in for a King non-smoking and got it. I checked in about 5 PM on a Saturday night which you might expect to be busy as latecomers try to get in and out for Broadway but I got through the front desk in under 5 minutes.I received a call from the front desk in about an hour to make sure the room was fine. Excellent refurbished room which lives up to the 4 star rating. The lobby is fully renovated except for a few very minor details. All the rooms are reportedly refinished.I would not be surprised for the pricing to creep up as they work their way out of the renovation reputation. Over 5 nights I am saving an easy $1000 over comparable rooms which was enough to pay for the conference I am attending. I was not even going to attend the conference because of solid room pricing going for $400+ all over Manhattan.The only slight negative is the place does reflect the young and family nature of time Square and not as quiet for a business trip...but just minor annoyances (some banging doors, some hall congregating, pushing elevator buttons when waiting still waiting, etc.) But a great value overall.I think some of the negatives are for slight annoyances for a $400+ room when you are expecting the experience to live up to $400 anywhere else...lifetime kind of room. Welcome to NY baby! :D"
207,1789,"Oct 4 2008 	Avoid at all Cost	I stayed there for two weeks on business, and it was the worst. Upon arrival it took over 45 minutes just to check-in, then I get to the room and it has not been cleaned. Waited another 30 minutes to have room cleaned. Front counter staff are the rudest people ever, to include management. You pay full price, and get less than half service. Elevators are slow and you wait forever. Wireless internet at $20 a day is slower than a dial-up connection. Went to check-out at 6:00 a.m. and three reps behind counter and all three made me wait because they were busy doing hotel paperwork. I don't normally write reviews but this hotel is bad. I cannot believe they get away with such poor service. They will take your money and act like you are bothering them when you have a problem. The hotel counter staff are nasty and rude and really do not care. People were constantly complaining at the front desk. Internal phone from room does not work. Stay away!!!"
208,1789,"Oct 4 2008 	Made Me Feel Like Cattle	In a city offering of some of the finest hotels, service, and hospitality in the world, there's simply no excuse for how bad my experience at the Crowne Plaza was. Their web site calls this hotel the &quot;jewel in their crown.&quot; Well if this is the best they can do, then that's pretty sad. During my three night, four day stay I was continuously disappointed, beginning with the fact that the front of the hotel is under construction and my taxi circled three or four times trying to find it because they couldn't even put a proper sign out front. Here are some other experiences that ensure that I will never stay here again.1. On the two occasions I needed to visit the front desk (something I tried my best to avoid), I was met with an unsmiling staff member who clearly made no effort to go out of their way to be hospitable or helpful. The most basic level of service industry courtesy seemed too much effort for them.2. Adding to the unpleasantness of the front desk experience, the lobby area has no sectioned off system for allowing people to stand in line to be served. Everyone just stands in a big mess competing with one another for the attention the next desk clerk. It's very uncomfortable and the wait is very long. The staff avoid making eye contact with you and just look down typing or doing something that's important to *them* so they don't have to deal with the next customer.3. Even when you call down from your room to get help with something (like the fact that you need a password to get on the internet and there's not one word of instruction about this on the hotel desk), it's impossible to get the front desk on the phone. I had to call numerous times, it would just ring and ring. I even had trouble getting room service to pick up!4. The hotel has no business center, so when I had to make a fax, I waited about 15 minutes in the front desk &quot;non-line&quot; finally forcing myself on a desk clerk to get their attention, and be reliant on these unhelpful people to do it for me. Of course, it didn't go through and they didn't care, so I just went and used a kinko's. 4. My husband and I awoke at 6am the first morning of our stay (he on his way to a work conference) to no hot water. They blamed it on construction which apparently has been going on for over 6 months!5. It's very hard to get a taxi out front. The bell hops were often missing when I went out and needed to flag down a cab. That's just a basic service of any NYC hotel, nevermind one of this caliber and price. 6. There is a beautiful open lounge area in the lobby but it's roped off and no one is allowed to sit there from what I can see. How sad is that?Really, all I can say is that I felt so unspecial, like cattle, staying here. If one person had smiled or been courteous I wouldn't be writing this negative review. I'm pretty forgiving and don't require much attention. This hotel was simply the definition of poor, apathetic service."
209,1789,"Sep 30 2008 	Big mess	I spend 4 days there, the worse experience ever!!Almost one hour to check inBreakfast take so long every day I bought a package and asked to storage for me, and the package gets lost!!! I wrote an email asking about the package cause someone signed for it and nobody answer."
210,1789,Sep 24 2008 	Great Views	Enjoyed great views of Times Square and the Empire State Building from our tastefully decorated corner room on the 32nd floor. It was a wonderful experience which was not really marred by the ongoing reconstruction work and the non-existent lobby.
211,1789,"Sep 22 2008 	Rude and Nasty Atmosphere	We called the hotel prior to reserving a room because we wanted to be sure we would get a Concierge Level corner room as advertised online. We were told we could reserve this room and check in time was 3PM. When we got there at 3PM we waited in a long line only to be told the room wasn't ready and there was no guarantee we would get a corner room. We asked to speak to a manager and he told us the same thing. No apology, no eye contact. He told us we would have to prove that we were supposed to get a corner room, but our confirmation email only had a confirmation number; not room details. We waited with our family over an hour and a half for a non corner room. I asked the manager about the pool and he said it was a lap pool only and children were not allowed. He said there was a fitness room but that we would have to pay $15 per day for it. The security person standing at the elevators informed us that we have to move quickly if we wanted to catch an elevator. Apparently he was not kidding because the doors close so quickly after it opens that we missed the first one. I saw an elderly man almost fall trying to get to his elevator. We assigned elevators to our family members to stand in front of so that we would not miss the elevator again.When we got to our room our luggage was not there and we had to wait another half hour for it. I thought I would read, but the lamp was broken. I thought I would shower, but there was only one robe when we were each supposed to have one. I reported the broken lamp and lack of robes. They never came to fix the lamp and took a long time to bring the robes. No apologies from any staff.We went to the breakfast that was supposed to be included in our package, but had to go back to the rude and nasty front desk to get &quot;vouchers.&quot; We had to do this both mornings if we wanted to eat breakfast. Also, we had free parking included in our plan but no one told us the process of needing the voucher from the front desk. When we got back after the sporting event the security man at the elevators was rude to us by saying,&quot; show me your key card.&quot; He never said please and was unfriendly. When we finally got to our room we wanted to order room service only to learn that there was no menu or hotel services book in our room. When I called room service they told me to look harder for it. It was not in the room, so we asked for a pizza, a cheese burger, one beer, one water and a glass of milk. It was delivered with one napkin, one set of silverware and one saucer plate. They charged $75. We had to use the hand towels in the bathroom as plates/napkins.We were glad that we used the security lock on the bedroom when we were there because the maid tried barging in without even a knock. Again no apologies. We also did not receive the turn down service as promised.When we got to the buffet restaurant for breakfast the next morning an employee dressed in suit standing behind the host desk was complaining to a customer about another customer stating that he was, &quot;A loud demanding Italian man&quot; and that he should have awakened earlier if he wanted better service. I don't know but I'm guessing the &quot;Italian man&quot; was on vacation and got up when he wanted to not when the employee wanted him to. The waiters we had in the restaurant were the nicest employees of all of the Crowne Plaza staff. They apologized for less than adequate service (no knives on the table and no napkins) and dirty coffee cups on our table.When we went to check out, the man at the front desk tried taking our credit card for payment without ever showing us our bill. We checked our bill and noticed extra charges for parking that were supposed to be included in our plan. We had to tell him to remove the charges. No apologies.I asked the restaurant staff if they were under new management because I had stayed there three years ago and had a great experience, but I will never return. We spent over $1000 for an awful two night stay. We would have been treated better if we had stayed at a Holiday Inn. We wanted an experience and boy did we get one!With the exception of the two waiters in the restaurant every employee was rude and nasty. Even the employees walking down the halls would not yield to the guests. Guests beware!"
212,1789,"Sep 22 2008 	Utterly Incompetent	I arrived late to town (11:30 pm) but I didn't think I'd have a problem because I had a guaranteed reservation and I had called to alert the front desk that I would be arriving late. &quot;Jaime&quot; told me not to worry--the room would be held. Upon arriving, there was a crowd of people in the lobby waiting for rooms, as they were oversold. They offered to put me on a rollaway in a conference room (for $450 a night!). I made it clear that they would be giving me the room I had paid for and confirmed, and after 20 minutes of heated argument (just what I want when I get to town for an important meeting the next morning), they relented and gave me a room. I think the front desk staff may have been killed by the mob in the lobby after they gave me a room before other people who looked like they had been waiting for hours. The problems didn't end there. I lost my key, so I schlepped back down to get a new one. Back up, and the new one doesn't work. Back down, 15 minutes of the desk staff looking confused, and finally &quot;All our key machines are broken.&quot; Really? They can't make keys? Sorry, I thought this was a hotel. Silly me. They said they would send security &quot;right away&quot; to let me in. 30 minutes later (after already going up and down elevators for 15 minutes for a total of 45 minutes), I was let in. I was late for work. If this had been the first problem, I could have let it pass, but on previous stays, I have been overcharged, had the noisiest room Ive ever heard, not been moved when they promised I would be, waited 45 minutes in line to check in, and been given keys to a room that already had a family in it. Although it is close to my office, I will NEVER go back."
213,1789,"Sep 17 2008 	Crowne Plaza at it's best	I just returned from a trip to NYC. I was there 3 nights and because cost was an issue, I stayed at 3 hotels, which I bid for on Priceline. The third was the Crowne Plaza Broadway. $255. This is definitely a top-of-the-line luxury hotel. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and able to accommodate our special requests. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable and very well decorated. The hotel is in a great location, on Broadway, very close to the subway, walking distance to Rockefeller Center. As we were changing hotels so frequently, we needed to ask the hotels to store our luggage. The bell staff at the Crowne was exceptionally helpful as they had said it might be difficult to get into our luggage mid-afternoon, but they were very quick to get it for me mid-afternoon and very very nice about it, joking around and helping me manage to get what I needed. At the time we stayed the hotel was under a bit of construction. The Broadway entrance was closed, which didn't bother us at all. The bar was also closed, but next door there was a bar where we went for a nightcap. Additionally, Ive never seen a hotel so careful about security. At night, at both the door and the elevator, you need to show your room keycard to a security guard to gain entrance."
214,1789,Sep 15 2008	Stolen Bags from the Bellman! They will only give $100	I travel often for business and never have I experienced terrible customer service like this! My room wasn't ready so I checked my bags with the porter like I always do. When I returned from my meeting they could not find my luggage. The secutity director said he would review the taples. The next morning my bags were still not located so he advised to shop for what I needed and they would reimburse me. Bottom line is it has been over 60 days and I have not recieved any form of resolution. My persistent followup with their insurance company and the hotel finally resulted in them advising me NYC has a limit of $100 in the event they lose your bag. So I am out of $5000 worth of items in my luggage as well as items purchased as a result of their incompetence and my only recourse is to take them to court. I have also contacted the attorney General as well as the CEO of Crowne Plaza! If you stay at Crown Plaza in NYC please do not leave your bags with the bagman!!!!!!
215,1789,"Sep 13 2008 	Best Trip EVER!	Stayed for five nights and loved it. We arrived to a great looking hotel positioned right in the heart of times square. lobby was under rennovation however every thing eles was complete. incuding new renovated rooms.We booked a double bed room and was given a King size corner room which had a breathtaking view. the room was a really good size and was a nice place to come after every exhausting but fun day. It was cleaned every time we left the room.I was polite to staff and they were polite to me and thats how its should work, they were helpfull and smiled even though we arrived at midnight. We ordeded room service and it was more then we could ask for..lovely food and the service was excellent. Location..Location...Location...perfect location...if you want to be on broadway times square..book with this hotel...when your out and about and your tied and just want to get to bed...look up and you will always find the Crown plaza...So my review is excellent hotel..Excellent location..great rooms great service...Remember some people are not polite to the staff so why would you expect staff be polite to them, even though they would try...they are here to help and they helped..great service in my experience...Small renovation in the lobby that we were aware of anyway..but it didnt effect us one little bit and onces this last little bit of renovation is complete this hoel can only get better.."
216,1789,"Sep 7 2008 	Will never return to this hotel	This is my 12th visit to New York from the UK and every time I like to stay in a new Hotel. But I have never experienced such bad service from a hotel as from this one. This trip I took with my mother. We arrived at the hotel to some &quot;not mentioned about before&quot; renovation work being done in the Lobby and to the lifts. Above the noise of the drilling I was told that we had been upgraded to a better room. Thanking them we went up to a nice, but small corner room with only one double bed. I went down to explain that I was with my mother and a double bed was out of the question, The surly, miserable and unhelpful receptionists (they would call themselves professional, I would could call them surly) explained that although it was only 2pm, there was nothing they could do and refused to change the room at all. Not even to the room that was originally booked. Their sighs under the breath and shrugged shoulders infurated me. After speaking to the sweating manager he promised a rollaway bed would be delivered at once. Two hours later - no rollaway bed. Another trip to the reception. &quot;Its on its way!&quot;. When we returned from Dinner - still no rollaway bed! Many trips on the hour down to reception right up to Midnight - no rollaway bed was ever delivered. The receptionists and Manager are well trained in fobbing people off. They appeared to be running around in circles, unable to cope. On my regular trips down to reception many others seemed to be experiencing similar problems - &quot;The room's not ready yet - come back in an hour&quot; seemed to be their catchphrase.There are many Hotels in New York and anyone would be MAD to choose this one. But if you want to take a chance - be my guest! I have never been so thankful for a holiday to finish."
217,1789,"Sep 1 2008 	Don't Go Because of the Pool	If your kids need a pool, in NYC you are severely limited--&gt;only about 10 hotels in the city have them.The Crowne Plaza was the only one available (within a reasonable price $370/night) with 2 double beds and a pool.What you can't find anywhere is that the pool is a lap pool that's really part of a health club. That part I actually knew but the deal breaker was they wanted us to wear swim caps, which they'd be happy to sell us for $3 a piece.Now, playing in a pool with my 9 and 7 year olds wearing swim caps and old people swimming laps wasn't what I had in mind.Otherwise, the hotel was OK. We stayed at Le Parker Merdien last year. Their pool is fun, but they wanted over $600/night this year."
218,1789,"Aug 31 2008 	miserable staff	My wife, 6 year old son and I stayed for two nights in August, on the way back to the UK after spending two weeks in Florida. Whilst in Florida we had stayed in a Crowne Plaza and two Holiday Inns and had experienced polite, pleasent and help staff - this wasn't the case in New York.When checking in the lady on reception must have gotten out of bed on the wrong side as everything was too much to ask of her. We got to our room which was fine but nothing special and thought we would check the room directory as this couldn't be as grumpy as the reception staff. The problem was they don't have one due to the construction work being carried out!!We had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning and just wanted some breakfast cereal and toast which caused all sorts of problems with the staff. Rather than allowing us to get this ourselves the staff had to do it themselves and this took nearly 30 minutes. For this we were charged the sum of $40, no kids eat free at this Crowne Plaza!I'm sure they must be hoping that people use room service looking at the prices.I'm a Platinum level Priority card holder so stay at this chain of hotel quite a lot and have never met such unhelpful staff, they just seem to have given up and blamed everything on the reconstruction.My advice to people thinking of staying here and paying $400 per night book somewhere else at least until the work has been completed, the location is good but that's all there is and there are other hotels close by that I'm sure will be a lot cheaper.My advise the the Management would be to send your staff to Florida and hopefully they might learnt how to be pleasant to they customers!"
219,1789,"Aug 29 2008 	Newly renovate rooms. Lobby still under renovation	If you are just looking for a place to sleep this hotel was very nice. The rooms are newly renovated so they were nice and clean and a good size. The lobby was still under construction so there wasn't anyone to talk to for help. Also there was no resturant or lounge in the hotel at this time, but I think it's in the plans as part of the renovations. Very Very good location if you are looking to hang around time square."
220,1789,"Aug 19 2008 	Never Come Back	We came to NYC for a family weekend to see the Yankees play and to enjoy dining in NYC. My son booked a room at the hotel using Orbitz; once he had his reservation I booked my reservation using the hotel's website. We each requested a room with two double beds.1) Hotel was undergoing major renovation. We were not told this, and had loud construction activity until 7:15 p.m. on Friday. No dining room or bar; only room service and limited breakfast seating.2) Apparently they overbooked the double/double room type. We were finally offered a king and rollaway 6 1/2 hours after we arrived on Friday. Took three requests before the rollaway was brought to the room; finally arrived at 11:45 p.m.3)Was told by the MOD that we would have free internet service; the web site did not indicate that you have to pay for internet service. Could not access the service without agreeing to pay for it.4) Our reservation price included parking. When we checked out, we were not told we needed to give the parking garage a hotel voucher for the parking ($78). Had to return to the hotel to get the voucher.5) Line staff (housekeepers, bell staff) were courteous, friendly and responsive. Front Desk and concierge were unresponsive, evasive about the problems with our room, and dropped the ball on the rollaway twice. Our luggage stayed on a cart in the lobby for almost 4 hours before we regained control. General impression - guests are a bother.6) MOD who finally got us in a room was helpful, but didn't follow through on the internet service and offered no accommodation for our waiting 6 1/2 hrs for a room before being offered an alternative.7) Two nights cost $832. While location was convenient, the lack of training, limited service mentality, and totally uncaring front desk staff and managers made this overpriced regardless of convenience. My family and I will never return and will think twice before booking a Crowne Plaza hotel again."
221,1789,"Jul 30 2008 	Great hotel great location	i have stayed in a lot of hotels in New York and I have found this to be the best. We arrived at 9.30 in the morning and I expected to be told to come back later to check in, but they had our room ready for us, which was very much appreciated. The rooms were very modern, comfy and quiet.. Staff were all friendly and helpful, from the doorman to the cleaners, everybody said hello to you, which is very unusual for hotels and made us feel like we weren't just another guest.The location for this hotel is great right in the heart of times square, close to theatre's, restaurants and shopping. I will be going back to this hotel and would recommend it to others."
222,1789,"Jul 24 2008 	OK but pricy	Not the greatest hotel. Bad Things: - Check-in was a nightmare. We arrived just after noon. Told to come back in an hour or so. Had lunch and returned around 3 pm. Still not ready. &quot;Should be another hour or so.&quot; We go to buy some show tickets and return a couple of hours later. Still nothing. &quot;Should be another 45 minutes to an hour.&quot; By this time it's 6pm and the show started at 8pm. Room was finally ready at 7:50pm leaving no time to get cleaned up or dressed. Very frustrating to be lead along like that. As I stood in line for the 4th or 5th time, I notice they were telling everybody pretty much the same thing. - Renovations will hopefully improve things, but in the meantime, don't plan on sleeping in if they're working on the floor above you. - No real lobby or any kind of place to relax, so it's either your room, or Times Square. - We needed a corkscrew as the rooms do not have any. Room service was happy to bring one up - for a $5 charge. Kinda chintzy IMHO. - The hotel's right in Times Square which is probably the worst place to stay in New York in terms of crowds and tourists.Good Things: - New rooms are very nice. - Hotel's very close to all the theatres if that's what you're in town for."
223,1789,"Jul 23 2008 	Ask for a corner room!	I have stayed at this hotel several times over the years while attending an annual conference in New York. Although I might think it out of my price range personally, as a conference hotel it was reasonable. The location is great: right in Times Square, just blocks from several Broadway theaters, on several subway lines, etc.Although the lobby can be busy during the day, it is very nicely appointed and the staff are always very helpful and prompt with their service. On the higher floors, the street noise is barely noticeable. One visit here I got a corner room with views out in two directions, giving me an amazing panoramic view across Manhattan and the surrounding area."
224,1789,"Jul 22 2008 	Dirty well used room	I was pretty disappointed by my stay at this hotel. For the cost of the room, I expected more. But soon after I walked in, I noticed food stains on the white bedspreads, a wrinkled and pretty dirty carpet, and random hairs all over the place. It appeared there had not been vacuuming recently as I found an M&amp;M and a few coins on the floor. Most of the furniture had worn spots as well and there was not hotel directory mentioning the amenities, places to eat, etc. Also, I could not get the internet to work at all while there despite calling Information Tech. and talking to them for 10 minutes. I did notice a renovation sign somewhere in the lobby so hopefully they are redoing the rooms. I wouldn't stay here again unless the room had been redone."
225,1789,"Jul 18 2008 	Under complete renovation -- avoid until complete!	Stayed here for 4 night on business and was happy I wasn't forking out my own money to stay here. The entire hotel is under renovation and its a complete pain to even get into the lobby (or back out for that matter). There is only one eleveator working from the main floor to the 2nd where the temporary lobby is, which makes for very long waits when trying to get in and out of the hotel, particularly during rush periods. The rooms were large in size for NYC standards, which was nice, and the beds were comfortable, but I just couldn't get past all the construction, esp. at $600/ night which is RIDICULOUS for what you get. Worst of all was all the drilling that would wake me up at 7am from the above floors. Don't stay here until all the renovation is complete. The location is nice (if Times Square is your thing) but that is about all this place has going for it right now."
226,1789,"Jul 4 2008 	Unfortunately...disappointing!	On a positive note, check-in and check-out were fast and easy. The furnishings in the room were very nice, and the beds were extremely comfortable. There was great lighting in the bathroom and in the room. The room itself was quite spacious, and there was a good-sized closet as well. There was adequate hot water and excellent water pressure for 4 adults to shower at any hour. Although the hotel was under renovations, there was still a general feeling of good quality and luxury. My family and I felt very safe and 'at home'. Unfortunately, the service and resolution of issues was not up to standards.I have stayed at many 'InterContinental Hotels Group' hotels (including other Crowne Plaza's and many Holiday Inn's), and have graciously grown to expect a fairly high level of service and quality/luxury. I have also grown to expect that most aspects of a room/overall stay will be in order...and if there is an issue, that it be dealt with swiftly and professionally. This was NOT the case with this hotel. Surprisingly, none of the staff were very pleasant or professional, nor overly helpful. The issues that I brought to the staff's attention were not resolved, eventhough I was very pleasant and courteous when making light of the issues. These issues were: there was no hotel directory in my room, the phone did not make outgoing calls, the coffee maker was broken, there were no club amenities delivered, there were not enough towels, and the people beside us were fairly loud. All issues were rather surprising, given the quality and luxury of other Crowne Plaza hotels that I've stayed at in other cities.I absolutely did NOT feel as if I received good value for the money I paid. I paid for an executive room....expecting 46th floor, view of Broadway, upgraded amenities, a club lounge, etc. I was placed in a regular room, 5 floors below and it had a few issues (mentioned above).Conveniently for the staff and management, there were no comment cards available upon request, and there was nobody available to hear feedback.Up until this stay, I have always been extremely impressed with IHG hotels...especially Crowne Plaza's. I always proudly give very positive feedback and praise where it is deserved. Based on this stay, I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone I know. I would, however, highly recommend the Holiday Inn Fifth Avenue (which is very close by). I might give this hotel a second chance in the future, but not anytime soon.I genuinely hate to say that my family and I were quite displeased with our stay overall, and with the service we received. :("
227,1789,"Jun 24 2008 	fab hotel	We ( being my mother, my daughter, myself and my sister in law ) have just returned from from the crowne plaza,which at the moment is undergoing ( there words) an reinvention.What a fab hotel , it does does not at the moment have a restaurant or a bar as it is being renewed , but we did know that before we went , but we did have 2 of the new rooms ( I think they are all finished but not sure) which was fantantic, The only downside is that you have to get a lift from the lobby to the first floor and then another to the rooms ( this will change when the work is finished ) and there was at times long delays to get to the first floor.The hotel is right in the middle of times square, but once in the room you can not hear anything including other guests The staff are all excellent all very polite , I am already looking to return to new york and if I do I will book the crowne plaza by which time the rest of the work should be finished ."
228,1789,"Jun 24 2008 	WORST PLACE EVER	Bed bugs, dirty glasses, rude management....need I say more??I travel for business quite often, and I've stayed at Super 8's to Four Seasons (depending on who is paying the bill). In this case, I would have been happier with the Super 8 - at least there I didn't spend over $300 per night for a room with NO RUNNING WATER!STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT A GOOD VALUE!!"
229,1789,"Jun 23 2008 	Messed up reservation	In spite of the fact that we booked in August, the hotel managed to mess up our reservation over Christmas 2007. We arrived after a late flight, which I had warned them about by phone twice over the previous two weeks, and found that our room was not available. We had booked a twin room and had to be given a small double room with a cot. The next day they had to move us into a twin room which was not the superior room that had originally been booked.The staff at the hotel were, however, all wonderful - I blame the InterContinental admin for the screw up.I wrote a letter of complaint to IC, but never got a reply.It was also disappointing to note that there was no vegetarian meal in the restaurant on Christmas Eve."
230,1789,"Jun 22 2008 	Stay was a nightmare!!	My stay at the Crowne Plaza was nothing less than a nightmare. I stayed there for 4 nights/5 days and it seemed so long. While I was checking out, I thought, to myself, bad decision this time but I know better now. But little did i know that the worst was still to come. My flight was in the evening and the check out had to be done at noon. I thought to make use of the time and went out for shopping. The luggage and my laptop was checked with the hotel in their baggage area after much assurance that it will be secure. On my return, I was handed my luggage but my laptop was missing!! We looked everywhere in the locker area but it just wasnt there. The security manager was called and to my disbelief he didnt have much to say or do. With little time at hand, i relunctantly filed a written complaint at the hotel and took a flight back home. Its been a month now and NOTHING has been done about my lost laptop. The hotel doesnt know how it went missing and i still dont have any claim for the loss. My sincere advice to all fellow travellers, as much as possible avoid staying at such a reckless hotel."
231,1789,"Jun 22 2008 	Okay location but that is about it!	We stayed at other hotels within NYC and decided to try the Crown Plaza. 1 reason is due to taking 5 people and finding a nice hotel that we can all fit in 2 rooms. We were assured the renovation would not affect our stay. We had early requested checkin and had to wait for our rooms to be available. It was nice for them to call our cell when available. We stayed on the 34 and 36 floor rooms. They boasted about the pool and fitness center which sparked my son's interest. He ran out to get a swim suite for the night. We got back and he was told he had to rent a swim cap and towel! For the price of the room they should have been offered.My wife wanted coffee and the front desk said they would send some up. We got the grounds to make coffee which is okay but there was not coffee pot in either rooms. Luckily there was a starbucks close by. Overall the room sleeping was nice but 8am the next morning the renovation proceeded! Do not think of sleeping well on eithr floors, you can hear the jack hammers which do wake you up. So we checked out and went on your way! The hotel we like overall so far has been the Sofitel! Two blocks away, 4 star rating and cheaper then this hotel!"
232,1789,"Jun 22 2008 	Still bed bug problem	I stayed in this hotel for 5 days and noticed numerous itchy red welts on the 3rd day. Thinking nothing of it, I continued to stay at the hotel and it was not until the last night that I saw bugs crawling on the comforter when I woke up in the morning. I STRONGLY urge you to stay at a hotel with a better reputation, as this hotel has obviously not taken this problem seriously. They talk so much about how they have created a program to ensure that guests sleep well, yet they don't take care of their biggest PR nightmare 2 years after Dateline did a story."
233,1789,"Jun 18 2008 	Couldn't get it right	I stayed at this hotel last year and had a GREAT experience. That is why I decided to stay here again. Unfortunately, the experience wasn't even close to the one I had in 2007.I got there early and was told that I couldn't get the room I wanted until around 3pm but to keep checking back to see if the room was ready. Around 1:30 I checked back and was told by a different person that the room might not be ready until much later and I should just take a different room. After a while, I decided to take them up on their offer and when I went to that room, the room had not been cleaned so I went back to the front desk. At that time, they gave me another room which was right in front of the elevators which I refused and then was finally taken to another room, which was very nice and updated. I tried to cash a check with a credit card as back up and they said they didn't cash any checks but travelers checks. When I got up the last day, I found around 10 bites on my body. By this time I was just worn out with the whole experience and called the front desk to tell them I was leaving. When asked about my experience, I told them about the bites and they had me talk to the Front Desk Manager who said he would get back to me after they checked out the room. He did call after I returned home and left a message which I followed up with but he has yet to return my call.The hotel is under renovation so they do have some issues that should improve after the renovation is completed. The staff was not very friendly and not very accommodating. I can't decide if I will return or not."
234,1789,"Jun 13 2008 	Inadvisable	We spend five nights in the Crowne Plaza. The hotel is currently under renovation and everything is provisional such as the lobby and the dining rooms. Renovation work starts at 08.00 AM. Spending the day in the room is impossible except you are wearing ear muffs! Incredible noise until late in the afternoon.Bar's, Restaurants are closed until November. The lobby is only accessible via a management company and you always have to take the elevator and show the security your room key, which is cumbrous.We paid around 700$ but the rooms are old, no minibar, small cabinets and the bathroom was scruffy. Houskeeping was lousy, the bath was never really cleaned. Marks from the parent guests where still visible in the toilet !?!The good thing is that the hotel is located really close to the Time Square, the view from the 24th floor was nice and the staff were helpful and friendly but overall I would not recommend staying here until the renovation is over."
235,1789,"Jun 13 2008 	Comfort and Convenience	Here's a tip: Ask for a renovated room. That's what we did, and we weren't disappointed. For four nights, my family stayed in a double/double corner room on the 36th floor that afforded us views of Times Square, the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center. I love the contemporary feel of the renovated room and the new color palette consisting of blues, browns and gray is fresh and calming after a long day of exploring New York. And you've got to try the really comfortable beds and the plush duvet. As for the noise - the room was generally quiet but at times we could hear police sirens from the street down below...no biggie, though. And because the hotel is currently undergoing renovations, we could hear drilling in the daytime - but with the A/C on, it was negligible. I noticed though that the noise was more apparent in the bathroom. But since we were out during the day, we didn't hear much of it, thankfully.We had a 32&quot; LCD TV that had snow issues and which the Crowne Plaza maintenance guys tried to fix. It had a loose cable in the back that made some channels very snowy while other channels were fine. The TV wasn't completely fixed but we managed to live with it anyhow. The room didn't have a coffeemaker or a microwave oven but we requested for a mini fridge and they promptly brought one up. Also, there was a steam iron and an ironing board in the room, a clock radio and a hairdryer. The lamps were fascinating - each one had an extra outlet so we could plug in and charge our cellphones conveniently.The bathroom was clean and bright. I love the faucet! And we had no problems with water pressure or hot water. The shower was great, too. One pet peeve though was the rack for the toiletries. It can be a pain keeping those little toiletry bottles standing up on it.Also, prepare to be annoyed by navigating &quot;two lobbies&quot;. The hotel has its main entrance but you can only get to the main lobby by going up one floor via elevator. Then you have to take another elevator to get to your room. It was sort of tedious at times, but I guess the security check by the main entrance was alright for safety and practical reasons.All I can say is the staff was amazing. They were all helpful and accommodating and tried to make sure all our needs were met. We got in really early and checked our bags in and had asked the porter for a good breakfast place that's close by. He recommended Ellen's Stardust Diner where the whole family enjoyed listening to the singing waiters. I also called Guest Services a couple of times to ask about their business center (closed for renovations) or where the vending machines were (unavailable due to renovations) and they always had a few suggestions to offer. Housekeeping was also friendly and efficient. On our last day, the hotel also gladly kept our bags for us after we checked out.For first time NY tourists, I think the Crowne Plaza is an ideal place to stay. My parents were really happy with the location. It was a block away from our tour bus stop and some subway stations. It's a short walk to Times Square itself, and close to restaurants, delis, and a grocery store (I recommend the Food Emporium on 8th and 49th and the Belly Delly Deli next to Duane Reade for cheap, hot meals). I just wish the room was equipped with more amenities like small appliances since we had a relatively long stay at the hotel. However, for the rate we got the room for and its newness and location, we're satisfied and will always remember our stay at Crowne Plaza Manhattan."
236,1789,"Jun 12 2008 	not too friendly staff problems with renovation	Not happy with my stay- a lot of problems due to renovation, not too friendly a staff. It took me several calls to have my room madeby 7 p.m.(!) The room itself was somewhat small and &quot;busy&quot;.Despite the great location I will stay away from this hotel.Alex"
237,1789,"Jun 6 2008 	Absolutely appalling!	Spent a long time to select what we considered to be, judging from the web-site images, a top class hotel with all the facilities on site, should we wish to use them. WRONG! The hotel is in the process of a major renovation, meaning that the dining, bar &amp; lounge facilities aren't available. Some of the hotel is (At the time of our stay, 11th - 18th May) shuttered off. We had workmen in close proximity to our room, drilling, power chiselling &amp; hammering from 7:15 am through 'til 5:30 pm, for several days. The lifts (Err, elevators) seemed to be in constant use throughout the night (Our room incorporated the lift shaft walls) &amp; use of some were restricted for workmen use only, which meant access to &amp; from your room can take a lot of waiting around. Take a good book, ear plugs, or better still, STAY AWAY! The only thing good about the Crowne Plaza in Times Square is the immediate access to Times Square. Other than that, forget it There are plenty of other Hotels with similar access (I have no experience of these, other than a quick glance through the lobby door). The porter pleaded with us to come back in the future, as he said it was going to be wonderful after the work was completed. But, you know the saying about first impressions &amp; after this experience, we don't want another."
238,1789,"Jun 4 2008 	good deal for what we got	I chose the Crowne Plaza for a one-room stay for four adults, with parking included. The &quot;parking package&quot; that we got, for the last weekend in May, made for a very affordable stay by midtown manhattan standards -- two nights, with parking for one car included and with taxes, for $753. That is a little less than $100 per night per person, so I was pleased.We were on the 41st floor with views looking east; the traffic noise was practically inaudible, and we were in a newly-renovated room on a newly-renovated floor. The room had two double beds, ie it was a bit cramped for four adults, but in our case we are all female relatives and took it in stride.There was free coffee in the morning, and free copies of the New York Times, both in the lobby (they also deliver USA Today to the room, but I have yet to consider that a real newspaper personally). I have some niggles about things in the room -- we had to request more towels both days, and on the second day they had not even left us washcloths or face towels, just two bath towels, which is kinda lame. The one-cup coffee maker in the room had only decaf coffee pods, a situation that was never remedied (we didn't ask, but isn't it part of housekeeping's daily responsibility to top up the coffee supply?). The desk chair had a broken wheel that made it a bit tricky to sit in.The building is under renovation as others have pointed out, and the lobby is currently on the third or fourth floor and reaching it is a bit of a hassle and it is cramped. But, the days we were there, the staff was quick and courteous and all the stations were filled at the front desk and the concierge stand. The phone at the front desk was answered promptly when we called for help with the towels. I didn't go to use the gym but people who did seemed happy.If you need to park (no in and out privileges included in the package) and stay in midtown Manhattan, this parking package is a really good deal for a party of four and I'd recommend it -- it made for a great base of operations for our weekend trip."
239,1789,"Jun 4 2008 	One of the best so far	My wife and I have just returned from a five night stay at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan starting on the 26th of May 2008 and I have to say we were very impressed by this hotel. Although the hotel is currently under renovation, our stay was by no means interrupted by the work being carried out. We have stayed in some of the big named hotels in New York and this was by far one of the best. We arrived at the hotel at 2.30 in the afternoon and had to wait approx 30 mins for our room to be made up as the check in time is 3.00 pm. When you enter the lobby you need to take the lift to the first floor as this is were the reception area is.The rooms were extremely spacious,very clean and also had air conditioning. Fresh towels were provided, and the room was cleaned each day of our stay. For location it don't get much better than this. The view from our room was amazing, looking out on to Times Square and also on to the Hudson river. All the Broadway theatres, nice restaurants, shops and the NY information centre are within walking distance of this hotel. The only thing I would fault the hotel on is their Wi-fi acess in the rooms. Firstly for the daily cost of $20 and also the signal strenght was very poor. It was like trying to connect using dail up &quot; Very Slow &quot;. But this was only a minor issue. I would highly recommmend this hotel to anyone looking for good hotel in central manhattan. Thank you Crowne Plaza for a very pleasant stay. I have posted some pic's of our room for everyone to see.J &amp; J."
240,1789,"Jun 1 2008 	So Pleasantly Suprised	we had booked trip on hotwire so we were not sure what we were gonna get and WOW! INCREDIBLE. The lobby in certain spots are still be renovated, but not anything to interfer with your stay. Our room was one of the nicest I have encountered in a long time. Beautiful modern furnishing, great new comfy beds, soooooooooo clean. We also had a beautiful view. Location could not be better, especially if you are taking in a show. We had our children and they were thrilled that Hershey and m &amp; m are on the block as well. Service and pleasantness of staff was refreshing,"
241,1789,"May 26 2008 	Don't Stay Here!!	Booked a weekend in NY thru JetBlue Vacations. Looked at available hotels and after looking at the Crown Plaza website decided on this hotel. Rooms looked nice and clean and visually appealing. Arrived at the hotel to check in to find the hotel under renovation. This was NOT mentioned on the website or JetBlue website. Got checked in and went to the room. Stepped off the elevator to a dirty, saggy carpet that was held together with duct tape. Went to the room and came into a small, dark room with very outdated decor. The carpet was also dirty and saggy. The bathroom was old with tiles cracked and missing. If you opened the window, it was almost impossible to get it closed completely. It took two of us, one on each side to finally get it closed. The wall paper was dingy and peeling. We were on the 17th floor. Floor 15 looked much nicer as the carpet was new or newer. I should have asked to be moved but didn't think to until later. I feel like they were putting us on the older floor since we were booked under a package deal. Unless you can verify that the rooms have been COMPLETELY renovated I would NOT reccomend staying here. I have stayed at much better NY hotels for the same price. Traveler Beware!"
242,1789,"May 26 2008 	Not Bad--still under renovations	Spent a weekend in NY and enjoyed the location of the Crowne Plaza in Manhattan.Upon checking in, it looks like some renovations still are going on but once we got to our room, WOW--Very nice!!! Seamless glass shower doors, newl;y remodeled bathroom, wonderfull designed hallways. We were on the 42 floor and were impressed with the clean room. It was Extremely quiet--probably because we were so high up--but the view was very nice as well.Although we were told by the desk we would not be able to check in around 3pm, we got to our room around 1:30pm. My wife and I would go back in a heartbeat!!"
243,1789,"May 24 2008	Crowne Plaza not what I expected	For our senior trip, we stayed at the Crowne Plaza hotel. Positives first. The bed was excellent, new matress. Well, thats about it.. Negatives, the window would not shut, there was construction right below our room. To take a &quot;warm&quot; shower, you must wait at least 15 minutes for the hot water.... The carpet has seen better days. On the hotels website, they advertise free internet but when your there, they charge $20. I guess the hotel is pretty good for NYC."
244,1789,"May 20 2008 	A pleasant stay for the most part	My husband and I recently stayed here for a weekend. Other than the fact that they wanted $20 per day for wireless internet, I have no complaints about the room. It was clean, it was fairly spacious, the bed was comfortable, and everything worked. They even had this great sleep enhancement CD to help you fall asleep at night, which I guess some people find it hard to do in a city like New York. They were undergoing renovations at the time, so the restaurant was closed, and the floor with the health club was pretty wrecked, but that's to be expected. The room service menu was WAY expensive, so we didn't order from there. The location is great, it's in the middle of everything!"
245,1789,"Apr 29 2008	In severe decline - a poor value for the price	In two recent stays in April 2008, I was struck by the decline of this once-flagship property. Corridor carpets are fine, but room carpets look nasty and had visible rolls in both rooms. The hotel has gotten cheap with the laundry. When you book a room for two, you get only two bath towels, two hand towels, and two wash cloths -- you do as well at a Motel 6! No bath soap on one visit, and the internet service cut out completely on the second. On one visit, the water in the hotel was off all day. The bellmen are pretty worthless. On a recent visit, they chatted in the downstairs hall when our cab pulled up at the back entrance. We paid the cabbie, waited for a receipt, got out and hauled our bags out of the trunk. As we approached the door, a bellman came up with a rolling cart to see if we needed assistance -- which, by that time, we politely declined. Leaving the hotel an hour later, we walked out to the Broadway entrance and hailed our own cab, while the bellmen were still enjoying each other's company. Front desk staff were polite and professional on both visits. For a hotel that lists rates of $500 - $700, the Crowne Plaza is a poor value indeed. It truly needs to &quot;reinvent&quot; itself. As an alternative, check out the &quot;deluxe&quot; rooms at half the price at the Edison down around the corner on West 47th-- it's a somewhat dowdy old hotel, but it tries a lot harder than the Crowne Plaza."
246,1789,"Apr 18 2008	Might want to look elsewhere until renovations are complete	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza last year, and it was fine. Now, though, they are going through what they coyly describe as &quot;reinvention.&quot; On arrival, the computer system was down, so there was a long line of guests waiting to be checked in manually. Some rooms were not ready, but I got lucky--although I was advised that no water would be available the next day from 9-4. Not a problem, since my business meeting started early. The staff were offering free breakfast to compensates. The room itself needed work, dirty carpet, picture missing from the wall--but a very clean, comfy bed. The heater/cooler i was making a lot of gurgling noise, although it was not on. I was told that would stop--it didn't. That problem was due to thier water shut off and re-routing. Again, not a big problem, thanks to ear plugs. The television system, also computer-driven, was not working right, either. In the middle of a program, it reset itself to the menu and would only stay on a channel a few moments before going back again. They got it fixed after a while.On checkout, the computer system was still down, and they promised to e-mail my bill. That never came, and when I called, they told me they would fax the bill in response to a signed fax.All in all, if you are thinking of staying there, be sure to ask if your room will be one affected by the &quot;reinvention.&quot; If it is, you should get a substantial discount."
247,1789,"Apr 17 2008 	Worst hotel experience I've ever had	I'm not usually one to nitpick about hotels--as long as the basic requirements are covered (clean, comfortable, quiet) I'm not bothered by minor cosmetic issues. HOWEVER, the Crowne Plaza was awful by just about every standard!When we first arrived we were told that they were renovating so we had to shower either before 9 am or after 4 pm--kind of a pain if you're on vacation and want to sleep in. When we did shower at 8:30 am, there was no hot water. (this also meant that toilets didn't flush all day--GROSS! I don't even want to think how they were cleaning rooms with no water.) The first night water started pouring through the lighting fixture in our bathroom and flooded my makeup bag and ruined my husband's brand new $25 hardback book. When we complained to the front desk, they offered us a new room, but made NO attempt to compensate us for our ruined property or our trouble. They basically just shrugged and went, &quot;Sorry, but you got a cheaper rate, so this is what you should expect.&quot; (apparently their customer service standards were under renovation as well!)As far as the television went, HBO had no sound, and the pay-per-view channel wasn't working at all, so we couldn't even order a movie to relax.Also, the renovations meant no business facilities were available. (They had one computer behind the front desk that kids were on all day long.)All this did come at a cheaper Hotwire rate of $209 a night--but that was still definitely too much considering $100 youth hostels offer better amenities--you know, like being able to shower and flush the toilet!!The Crowne Plaza was without question the worst experience I've ever had in New York...Actually, it was the worst experience I've ever had in any hotel anywhere--including those in THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES!!!If their renovations make conditions so bad, they should just shut down the hotel, not scam visitors out of their vacation dollars."
248,1789,"Apr 17 2008 	Under renovation absurdly high amentity prices	I was disappointed in my stay there, for a two night business trip. It is being renovated, so they put me on a completed floor, where the rooms seem large and well-appointed, but they are turning the water off in the building every day from 9 am until 4 pm, and offered only a free buffet breakfaast as compensation. In addition, their standard rates for wireless internet access are an absurd and offensive $20 per day."
249,1789,"Apr 16 2008 	Great Stay	The rooms are nice and very clean, the staff was efficient, breakfast buffet was very good and the hotel is in a great location. We would definitely stay there again!"
250,1789,"Apr 15 2008 	Maybe maybe not	My wife, daughter (aged 20) and I just returned from a six day stay in New York. We had booked the hotel via my Priority Club/Ambassador membership of Intercontinental Hotels. We had booked a superior, two double bedded room on the executive floor at $500+ per night, including breakfast. We had booked th executive room so that we could have breakfast in the club room and use the club room when returning from our days out etc.The hotel is right near to Times Square and our taxi from the airport dropped us on the Broadway entrance. First thing:ask to be dropped at the back entrance as you then do not have to fifght across the crowds on Broadway. There is a doorman on the Broadway side but trying to keep your eyes on bags, and paying the taxi etc is tricky. The back entrance is much better.Reception is not on the ground floor so be aware that you have to pass through the crowds of people moving around the ground floor and escalators before you arrive at reception. Not really a problem but, along with the drop off, it created a chaotic sense of arrival. Reception is also small and we had to wait about 10 minutes to check in.Reception no problem, although my Ambassador status did not seem to give me any more recognition. We were given our room without any comments( see later).Room was on the 45 floor (out of 46). Clearly the rooms are being refurbished and ours was one of teh new ones. Nicely finished with their luxury bedding, plazma TV etc. The air conditioning has stayed as the old style and I would worry about its efficiency during a hot summer. The bathroom is small but again had been modernised and was clean and fresh. There is no mini bar but you get free bottled water each day. However, the so called two double beds are small, probably 4 feet wide ( a threequarter in England) ie not even a standard double. In a US hotel I would have expected at least two doubles. or Queens, in a superior room. If there is just two of you then no problem but for my wife and I to share it was pretty tight. My daughter had the other bed and she was OK. Some silly things, only one robe between the three.I went down to reception to see if there were any larger bedded rooms but received very little help from reception. At this point I asked about the club room only to be told it was closed. As such there was no dedicated facilty for breakfast or afternoon snacks etc. Given I had paid for this service I asked why we had not been informed before, or even at, arrival. Again I received no words of comfort other than, &quot; you can have breakfast dowstairs and we will give you breakfast vouchers&quot; and &quot; we will put canapes in your room each evening&quot;. Not exactly what we had expected or paid for. In the end we stuck with what we had and I had prepaid for the entire stay. Had I not, then I may well have looked elswhere the next day.Breakfast was good, served in the one and only restaurant but it can be busy as it is quite small for so many rooms. We did grab an evening snack the first night , which was OK but you would be better eating outside in any of the many restaurants. Ther is a small bar attached to teh restaurant. The so-called mini Strabucks in reception was never open but you can get free coffee from the bar in the early morning.The refurbishment of rooms is a danger as they start work quite early. On a couple of days it woke us but we were getting up anyway. Just be careful if you want a lie in.Concierge staff were all very good and helpful. They recommended restautrants and arranged excellant theatre tickets etc. Our room maid was also very pleasant.On balance we did have a great time in NY and the Hotel was nearly right on the button. They just need to advise of the lack of Club room, the refurbishment programme (get a new room) and the size of the beds. Hopefully you will now be pre-advised and can consider these points when considering."
251,1789,"Mar 30 2008 	ny break	I booked this hotel via the auction on Priceline. I paid $130 for what should have been a $300 room. When we arrived, I asked for a room with a view of Times Square, so the check in assistant upgraded us to a corner room with great views. The room was large, well decorated and clean. The hotel has a fantastic location for tourists - close to Times Square and on Broadway. The room was quiet. This is the best hotel I have stayed in in Manhatten. I have also stayed at the Hudson hotel, Four Points sheraton and a couple of others. I would recommend this hotel."
252,1789,"Mar 30 2008 	Just ok	We stayed at the Crown Plaza for four nights around Easter for a conference my husband was attending. When we arrived at 7:00pm, they did not have a room ready for us yet, but they did give us two days worth of free breakfast vouchers because of the problem. Our room was very nice-- quite large, actually, for a NYC hotel room. It was quiet--no noise from the street--but we weren't facing Times Square. The one problem that we did have was the shower. We could get hot water in the sink and somewhat in the bathtub, but for the first three days, we couldn't get enough water to take a hot shower. The second day, they sent an engineer up, but the third day it was so cold that we skipped the shower. Finally, on the third day, they changed our room to a different one--a hassle, but they did move our stuff for us. The concierge was very friendly, but their recommendations were really hit or miss. They seemed to keep directing us to more touristy haunts--and we really wanted to avoid that. Overall, the location of this hotel was great--on the northern edge of Times Square and very close to Metro stops, but they're in the middle of a big remodel right now, so the amenities are hit or miss."
253,1789,"Mar 25 2008 	Great Locationspacious room	We stayed for 4 nights early March, this is a great location within easy reach of all the major attractions.Our room was much bigger than we expected for a New York hotel.Very comfortable bed, our room (on the 18th floor) was quiet and peaceful to come back to after a hard days sightseeing.The decor is a little dated however the hotel is currently undergoing an exciting refurbishment project - not that this interferred with our stay in any way."
254,1789,"Mar 24 2008	Good Location Near Times Square	We have stayed at this hotel several times and they have always provided us with a good room that allowed us a comfortable stay in New York. The Crowne Plaza is on Broadway and is in easy walking distance to many attractions (Time Square, Central Park, Fifth Ave., Rockefeller Center, etc.) The hotel is undergoing a renovation and the room rates are high, but not for the location. Because of its location we have always found it to be a good choice for a quick weekend in the city."
255,1789,"Mar 17 2008 	Great location substandard service/room for the $$$.	I've always had good experiences with the Crowne Plaza line, but this $400+ a night hotel in the heart of Times Square left much to be desired. Granted, it's New York City, but I still think a hotel should live up to its &quot;brand&quot; and reputation, especially knowing the kind of money folks are paying to stay. The front desk service was rude from the first minute we arrived, and when we asked if we could store our luggage until check in time, you would think we'd asked if we could stay for free. The only employees in the entire hotel who rose above the dismissive and rude attitudes were the day concierge and the night bartender at the one restaurant/lounge. Which, for the record, closed up at 10 pm three of the five nights we visited.The wallpaper in our room was peeling - badly - and the bathroom was not as clean as it could have been.Overall, a very disappointing performance by an old, trusted travel &quot;friend&quot;."
256,1789,"Mar 13 2008 	Expected more from a 4 star hotel !	just returned from a 4 day trip to NYC and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Time square. Great location, within easy reach of most major attractions. Hotel itself was a little dissapointing for a 4 stars, room was relatively large as we were told on arrival that we had been upgraded to a room facing the broadway. However the decor was a little dated to say the least, broken tiles in the bathroom and the worn out fixed shower unit on the wall caused quite an inconvenience when trying to wash our 4 year old daughter's hair. The bath was cracked and dirty, despite the room being cleaned every day the bathroom floors was never once swept. The hotel needs a series revamp before it can be classified as a true &quot;4 stars&quot; !"
257,1789,Mar 10 2008	Poor attitude	Never got to stay there. I requested a non smoking room and then spoke to them and they tried to charge me substantially more for that &quot;luxury&quot;. Poor business sense. Will never book with them!
258,1789,"Feb 20 2008 	Great location comfortable beds	I stayed here for three days in January and really enjoyed my stay. I wasn't sure I'd like it here, given that it's right in the middle of chaotic Times Square, however, my room was very quiet. The staff were very friendly, and I especially enjoyed my interaction with the female concierge who was on duty. She gave many recommendations of places to go and eat, and she also handed out numerous maps with directions to everywhere. The room I stayed in was small but certainly more than adequate. The bed was heavenly! I usually don't sleep well when I'm out of town, but the quiet room and comfortable bed made the trip a lot better. The location is also great, as there's a lot to see and do in Times Square."
259,1789,"Feb 10 2008	Disappointed	Terrible stay. Loud, tiny room. Incredibly overpriced."
260,1789,"Feb 8 2008	open windows 27 floor up	Location was great, and room was fine, though dated (cracks in tile under sink, faded carpet. My main complaint was that I was there with my 5 year old son and the large window facing Broadway opened completely. No screen, no nothing, just stick your head out and gaze down Broadway. This was a concern for me since I had a young child, and the hotel could not relocate us to another room. I noticed - from the street - that looking up there were many windows open."
261,1789,"Jan 23 2008 	weekend getaway in nyc	My husband and I had a wonderful weekend in NYC Jan 18-20. We bid on a hotel through priceline on Tuesday of last week, won the Crowne Plaza Manhattan for cheap and I was thrilled. We got there after 7pm Friday night, asked for a room that is higher up...was told all rooms start on the 16th floor...the check in was smooth, friendly and helpful. We were on the 26th floor...in a corner room looking over Times Square. The room was huge for New York. My husband travels a lot and is in New York some, says this was the biggest room he has been in in NYC. The room was clean, comfortable and just what we were looking for! The hotel is right on Broadway right in the middle of everything!! We were happy with our entire stay. We were able to leave our bags on Sunday with the concierge until our flight out that evening. Definitely would stay there again and recommend it to frineds, family, anyone going to NYC!!"
262,1789,"Jan 22 2008 	Not that Bad	I reserved two nights at this hotel through Hotwire. Since I had never stayed here before I immediately came to this site to read the reviews. The many negative comments made me nervous, but it turned out to be be OK. The room was clean and decent size, and the staff was friendly enough. The biggest negative was that the bathroom was very dated (think 1980's) and is in need of a facelift. I would probably not be willing to pay much more than $200 per night to stay here, but for the Hotwire price of $165/night this hotel was a steal."
263,1789,"Jan 20 2008 	Great Location in Times Square	We stayed at this hotel for four nights in November, leaving two days before Thanksgiving. We found it to be in an ideal location, with all major attractions within reasonable walking distance. We found it cheaper to eat out all of the time, having only one breakfast and one dinner in the hotel but being charged for an extra breakfast, which we did not have, and took a long time to sort out. The room was large and nicely furnished,and as the brochure says they specialise in having comfy beds to give you a good nights sleep. The Concierge at this hotel were most helpful with all of our enquiries. We did not use the pool, but it did look inviting."
264,1789,"Jan 17 2008 	Brilliant	I booked this 5 day trip trip via lastminute.com &amp; i cannot grumble about anything.The hotel was spotless (our room was basic, no fridge but a very large TV! but who comes to NYC to sit in the hotel room!!!), room was cleaned everyday/fresh towels etc. Room was warm without the need for the heating on.When we arrived a the hotel, the check in was a little slow, the staff were all very helpful, we requested a room high up as we was worried about the traffic noise, we got a room on 38 floor overlooking Times Square - Result!Ate breakfast out most days, apart from the last two where we ate at the hotel &amp; i wish we had for the whole duration of our time here, we opted for the buffett breakfast &amp; wasnt disapointed.NYC as a whole was brilliant (cold) &amp; i am looking forward to going back but maybe not stopping as long in NYC itself.We did the skating in central park, boat cruise around Manhattan, helicopter, Top of the Rock, Empire at night, watched the Rockets Xmas show, went to watch the NICKS at Maddison Square Gardens &amp; spent a fortune in MACYS oh &amp; bought some UGGS!Was a little disapointed that NYC wasnt more Christmas'ie (the tree at the Rockafella Centre is amazing tho).I would stop at this hotel again, no questions asked!"
265,1789,"Jan 17 2008	new york  new york i wanna go back	flight from bhx not too good continental ,bit cramed , but the hotel best ever right on times sq ,43rd floor ,views fantastic ,nice staff ,went to shows every night , and on the grey line tour bus in day, q ed at ticket booth in times sq ,v good prices , i booked radio city in uk never again ,wait till u get there and q , only downside was the wind it was sooo cold at night , want to go again in may one year"
266,1789,"Jan 12 2008 	A pleasant stay	Returned for a 2 night stay. Room was ready for early check in, staff was helpful and welcoming. Location is great, restraunat is fair,great view of the Hudson River."
267,1789,"Jan 8 2008 	Quality Stay	My Mom, sister and I shared a room with two doubles this past week and were very pleased with this property. Arrived at 11 a.m., well ahead of normal check-in, but were provided a room immediately. Views are great (ours was a partial view of the Hudson River), rooms are spacious and clean; beds super comfy, decent shower pressure, flat screen hdtv, fast elevators and friendly staff. What really seals the deal is the location - in the midst of Time Square. The bar/restaurant, Samplings, has great views of the Time Square action and is reasonably priced for Manahattan. The bartenders could have been more attentive, but it was hardly noticeable. Lastly, the baggage storage is extremely convenient. We checked out at noon, stashed our bags with the concierge and were on our way. Truly helpful when you do lots of shopping and overpack :o)In closing, I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza again and am confident you will enjoy your time there as well!"
268,1789,"Jan 1 2008 	If you want inefficient staff 	We arrived tired from the UK at 8pm at night &amp; waited in the check in queue for 40mins, only to be told that the room was not ready We had to wait 2hrs for rollaway bed for our daughter. The reception staff are totally disinterested. We had booked breakfast, but the cashier forgot to give us the necessary vouchers, but wished we hadn't as the long wait for a table just isn't worth it. Go to the diner down the road. the room was ok but dated &amp; was next to the service lifts, the shower did not get hot &amp; the washbasin was in the bedroom as the bathroom was so tiny. We went to reception the next morning to request as room change. as we are platinum priority club this should be complimentary, we were told that the manager will not upgrade platinum club guests as he can sell the better rooms for more money! After 3 tries &amp; standing our ground we got an upgrade &amp; the room was fine although the room card kept de activating itself. If you are looking to have a relaxing swim after a busy day sight seeing think again- the pool it is a lap pool. Some of the NY swimming clubs use it, so it is roped off in lanes &amp; used for speed swimming, so unless you can do front crawl at breakneck speed forget it. The location is absolutely terrific but unless you want to come back more stressed than you went don't go there."
269,1789,"Jan 1 2008 	Bait and Switch?	The hotel itself was okay - location was good, room was clean and big enough for a New York hotel; overall the accommodations were fine and we have no complaints about the room or our stay. But, the lines to check in and get info were horrendous. We have never seen lines like this before. Also, we had made reservations on line for $269/night and when we got to the hotel, they tried to charge us $419 for the second night. Luckily we had a printed copy of our reservation showing $269 per night. I travel a lot and I have never had anything like that happen before. Would have rated the hotel a 4+ had it not been for the long, long lines to check in and the bait and switch attempt on the room rate. Also, this is the first time in NYC when we have been bothered by traffic noise even though we were on a very high floor. Must have been because the hotel is basically in Times Square, which was great for doing things and getting around."
270,1789,"Dec 27 2007 	Never again	I read all of the reviews and they were mostly good but I must say we did not have a pleasant stay. Our first room was motel like at best. The wallpaper was lifting off the walls, the carpet was stained and I could have found better furniture on the the curb. I called and expressed my displeasure with the room and was very polite but was told that night the only other rooms that were available would cost an additional $200. We were able to change rooms the second evening and it was much better but we will never go back."
271,1789,"Dec 23 2007 	Great location but needs to be refreshed / spend play money elsewhere	Booked two rooms at the Crown Plaza directly through their website using a corporate discount. At $225 per night (Fri &amp; Sat) the price was good given the accomodations. The rooms were clean but showing their age. The furniture was a bit worn &amp; chipped and the bathrooms are far behind the times (dated wall paper and counter tops). Beds were comfortable and the linens were fresh. -- Check in took 55 minutes+. A hotel this size needs more than six check-in stations. We were told the rooms we booked weren't available and the staff person tried to move us away from the double bed rooms we booked to king sized beds with cots. I was surprised I had to hold my ground and insist on getting what we booked.... even confirmed the booking two nights prior. After digging in and staying at the check in counter for 30 minutes, two double bed rooms appeared. -- Dinner at the hotel's 'Samplings' was poor. One adult dinner was sent back and another adult meal was half touched (too tired to fight again after the check in). It rained hard Sunday morning so we tried the breakfast buffet, which was was good, but at $80 for two adults and two children under age 9 was pricey. -- Asked the concierge for a recommendation of where to eat Saturday night and had them make a reservation (name withheld). We asked for someplace nice but reasonable for 4 adults and 4 young children. Out of all of NY, we went someplace and spent $450 for 3 good dinners, one fair dinner, and 4 bowls of pasta for the kids. OK, buyer beware, but be aware of the concierge! I thought they were on our side.... first time I was gigged by the concierge! --- Bottom line, great, great, great location. Good place to launch your adventures and get a good night's sleep (even if you pay a bit more). BUT - do your homework and spend your play money elsewhere."
272,1789,Dec 12 2007	Slap Bang in the Middle of it all	I stayed in the Crowne Plaza as part of my trip to New York with the charity &quot;Sense&quot; to run the ING New York City Marathon 2007. As you arrive at the hotel the porter comes to take your luggage up to your room (they LOVE a tip in New York - there is someone to do nearly everything for you for a small tip). The hotel is lovely and couldn't be better placed (literally opposite the neon lights of the famous Times Square. Our room faced the Hudson River so the view wasn't as amazing as it could have been had we been round the front of the hotel BUT it was still a great view as its New York City and everywhere you look is an amazing view. I love New York. The beds in this hotel are designed to help you get a better nights sleep and my it works and its just what I needed after the marathon.
273,1789,"Dec 4 2007 	Disappointing	Excellent Location, almost right on Times Square.However I redeemed points and could only book a double wheel-chair access room. A few weeks before our stay I send an email requesting a 'normal' King size bed - which was according to the website available, received a 'maybe' answer. When checking in, a trainee checked us in and gave us exactly the double wheel-chair room. That was ok, but given tha fact that it was a Crowne Plaza house really disappointing, stains and burns on the carpet, really nothing to get exited about. Porter was alsi kind-of rude."
274,1789,"Nov 26 2007 	Remodel scheduled!	Just returned from a nice stay at the Crowne Plaza/Mahattan/Times Square.Staff was &quot;New York cordial&quot; and there were some problems with getting a FedEx package shipped, but overall a pleasant stay.Just a note that the hotel begins a 6-MONTH REMODEL in January 2008, so BEWARE of construction noise during this time.Good eats nearby-Ruby FooBlue FinThaliaHeartbeatI'll review this hotel again after the remodel."
275,1789,"Nov 18 2007 	From Hero to Zero in just over a year	I have stayed that the Times Square Crowne Plaza two or three times a year for about five years, and have written reviews about it before. I think this may be my last stay. I used to love the hotel, but it's gone down hill. I arrived earlier than the 3 PM check-in time and my room was not ready. That's fine: I had no expectations that it would be. But the relish with which the front desk clerk told me this, and then the joy she had telling me that &quot;we used to upgrade platinum members but we stopped&quot; was really offputting. It was as though she was waiting for the opportunity to put a frequent guest in his place by reporting that things had changed. And on her lapel she was called &quot;Front Desk Trainer&quot;. This kind of surly, service with a snarl was fairly frequent; perhaps half the staff did their job but without any kindness. There were gems though: the woman who checked me out caught a billing error I missed, and one of the bellmen was great. But for hundreds of dollars a night I'd expect more consistent warmth.The room felt dirty and was not properly cleaned. The coffee maker was wet when I looked at it when I arrived, and soap was not replaced, nor trash removed, during my stay. The internet was unusable. I believe that guest usage has outstripped the hotel's bandwidth and it needs to be expanded. The room was musty when I arrived and just did not feel clean. When I checked in (after 3 PM) the woman at the front desk told me that the internet was complementary with my rate plan. But the internet was on my bill when it was slipped under my door. I did not notice this, but the clerk at the desk at check-out did: she told me that it happens all the time and she looks for it to reverse the charge, which she did. I wonder how many people just pay for the internet not realizing that is a mistaken charge.Anyway, for years I've looked forward to my stays here. Now I am looking for an alternative place to stay."
276,1789,"Nov 13 2007 	Good loation for Broadway	My Mother and I stayed here for my Birthday. The check in was a little painful not allowed into the room until after 3PM (She wanted to have the journey we'd had from the UK) and so we ventured out. The location's good for Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue and all the regular sights. The room was spacious and clean but old and in need of refurbishment. The bathroom was out of the 70s and like a shoe cupboard. We had a problem with the toilet and after reporting to reception were told &quot;they'll be up when they can do it&quot; friendly eh... not!The best service in the Hotel was from 1 of the bar tenders (sorry didn't get a name but very attentive), the consierge (Andrew I think very very helpful indeed) and the door men who love blowing their whistles to get you a taxi."
277,1789,"Nov 13 2007	A Great Hotel!!	My husband and I just spent 4 nights there and have no complaints. We enjoyed every aspect of the stay from the good food, service, cleanliness and comfortable beds. I would recommend this place to everyone. We were on the 41st floor. Merry"
278,1789,"Nov 9 2007 	Extremely Satisfied	Just back from a 4 night stay at the Crowne Plaza, New York City. From the moment I walked in the door to the moment I stepped out of the door and into the car to the airport I enjoyed every moment of my stay there. The lobby area is beautifully designed. The check in process was very smooth. We got a fanstastic corner room on the 43rd floor almost over looking the river. They have thought of everything in the room. There is a &quot;dream machine&quot; CD player with a CD in it to help you sleep, lavender spray for the pillows, internet access and on-demand movies/TV shows, ice machine conveniently located in the hall with drinks machine. Breakfast to room is expensive but worth it. Any time we rang reception they were very helpful and very friendly. The concierge desk can book trips for you. Samplings Bar serves very nice food and very friendly staff.I will definetly stay there on my next trip to NY."
279,1789,"Nov 5 2007 	Avoid at all costs!!!	Out of all of the hotels my husband and I have stayed at in Manhattan, this one was by far the worst. We travel there at least twice a month, so we have had the chance to try out a lot of the hotels in NY and this one is just terrible. The front desk staff is rude, unhelpful and completely uninterested in helping to make your stay an enjoyable one. If you do stay here, there are a few things you should not expect including: a helpful friendly staff, clean towels in the rooms, bellmen to help you with your bags, late-night room service, comfortable beds, clean rooms and unclogged showers (just to name a few). Everything about this hotel was a disappointment. Be aware also, that regardless of what the hotel's reservation line tells you, they will give away your room if you are not there to check in by 3 p.m. The only thing this hotel has going for it is that it is located in Time's Square, but, there are numerous other hotels in the same vicinity that are so much better than this place. Don't let the name fool you, this place is a complete dump. I will say that the valet staff was fast, friendly and efficient."
280,1789,"Nov 3 2007 	Overrated and not worth the cost	I just spent three days at the Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan for a business conference. It is not worth $400 a night. Regular rooms on the 20-floor range are tiny and average - nothing special. &quot;Priority Club&quot; rooms like mine, on floor 37, were nice but nothing extraordinary.I had nothing but problems with the $15 wireless internet and it was frustrating to waste time trying to log on. no ambience, plain generic atmosphere and indifferent staff made this a hotel to skip on my next long visit to New York.I wished I had booked at room at the Hudson Hotel - now THAT is a place that will make a trip to New York special."
281,1789,"Oct 31 2007 	Great location and service	My husband and I just returned from a last minute trip to New York.We had booked the Crowne Plaza through Priceline for a rate of $150.00 a night-quite a bargain for what we received! We arrived early,and were told we had to wait until the room was ready later that afternoon.I asked Jaime,the desk clerk if we could get a high floor room with a view.The adorable boy said,&quot;No problem,I have a great room on the 29th floor overlooking the harbor.&quot; Terrific-we went out for lunch and to see a show and returned at 4:30 PM.The room was incredible-it was double the size of the others on the floor-room 2912-and the view was lovely.The room was immaculately clean-one queen size bed with new bedding,a huge bathroom with tons of towels,a desk ,and a center console with TV.We also did not have a refrigerator.I think they removed them all,but no big deal.The only problem was the lack of pressure in the shower,but it was nothing to complain about.I figured out later that this was probably a handicap accessible room,thus the size.Some people feel that since Priceline is so deeply discounting the rooms that you will only obtain the worst rooms available.I always find that if you ask nicely,and you arrive early enough,you can get an upgrade.Especially if the desk clerk is Jaime-I wanted to adopt him,he was so sweet.Kudos as well to Natasha,another lovely desk clerk.All in all,great experience.The location is perfect-everything at your doorstep,Starbucks everywhere for coffee,and fabulous breakfast at Cafe Europa just up Broadway.The Marriott Marquis is down the street,where you can obtain half-price tickets to shows,and subway staion at 50th and Broadway.I'm from New York originally,and I love going back to visit.The Crowne Plaza is well worth staying in.And try Priceline-the regular rate for my 2 nights was 339.00!"
282,1789,"Oct 31 2007	great location average hotel	I stayed over a weekend in October. In general, the CP is a decent, no frills, large hotel that is centrally located in Times Square. If you want to be in Times Square, for theater or touristy activities, you can't beat the location. If you are not going for those things, by all means avoid Times Square and this hotel. The hotel is well run, despite having a huge number of rooms. Customer service, house cleaning, restaurant/bar service, and conceirge service all get high marks. A couple pleasant suprise features of the hotel is the drive under taxi drop off/pick up and the fitness center. The covered/drive under back entrance is great for taxi entrance and exit without using Broadway. Being covered, it came in handy while it rained. It's not a glamorous feature, but a very practical one. The fitness center, is a NY Sports Club, which is a private fitness center chain. It is right in the building and has everything one would expect from a big gym - weights of all kinds, cardio machines, and even group classes. It is a significantly better fitness center offering than most top end hotel offer.Areas in need of improvement include the common spaces of the hotel, which need updating and freshening. The hotel has a somewhat dated feel to it. The same goes for the rooms. While the beds were comfortable, the amenities were only on par with a Best Western. The TV was old and low tech, the closet door was pretty flimsey, and our one sink was cracked and discolored. Nothing horrible, just a space badly needing updating. Given that the hotel is far from cheap, these are definite knocks against the place. Again, if you want a well located, well run hotel near the action, you will be fine with the CP. If you want a romantic or luxury style hotel in that area, I'd opt for the W hotel, which probably isn't much more expensive."
283,1789,"Oct 28 2007 	Great place to see in the New Year	I took my then girlfriend to New York for a week around New Years 2002/03.I booked directly over the phone from the UK after being let down by my booking agent. They were very helpfull staff and I explained that I would be proposing to my grilfriend and could they do anything special for our arrival. Our room had a bottle of champagne and strawberries set out ready and they offered me the use of their top floor lounge to propose. I subsequently did the deed ontop of the Empire building, but was gratefull of the hotels help. If you are seeing in the New Year, the hotel is excellently positioned in times squre and has security only allowing hotel guests in on the evening itself.p.s. Top tip, there is a steak restaurant opposite the hotel, which name escapes me. Book a table in there for about 9pm, take a nice leasurly meal and enjoy drinks etc, then come out onto the street for the countdown. Beats standing in the throngs for 7 hours!"
284,1789,"Oct 24 2007 	Very Central	we arrived on the 11/10 and stayed til 14th.. lovely hotel, on checking in at 2.30/3pm we were told our room would not be ready for another hr, so we had a bite to eat there while we waited. We were given 2 cards for our room and one didnt work so we had to go and get that sorted and you needed ID etc..Breakfasts were good, fill you for the day!! Overall the rooms were clean and views were spectaciluar of Times Sq. we were on the 40th floor. Cleaners in everyday to make beds and change laundry.. it cost us $389 a night.. The only thing i would suggest is dont ring home from hotel phone, i rang Ireland for 5 mins and it cost $30, i thought this was a bit expensive.. Defo go back again"
285,1789,"Oct 22 2007 	Very Bad - will not return	First let me say that I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza, Manhattan several times for business and pleasure since 1995. We booked this hotel for one night (which it in itself, too long a stay) for the evening of October 9, 2007. My son and I had just gotten back from Paris and always enjoyed staying at this hotel.We stayed in Room 2309 - which was unbelievably run down....the curtains were old....the Sleep Room beds had two little pillows, soft and worn, no large sham pillows at all.....the desk had multiple wires running under the chair and around the carpeting which was worn and dirty. Just about every bath, wash cloth, etc. had hair from previous guests in them.....it was disgusting.....Since we had major jet lag that evening, we waited until morning to contact the front desk where the line to check in and out was extremely long and we had a plane to catch home but waited until the next day.I did make my comments known on the Crowne Plaza website and a lady by the name of Lashana of Guest Relations called. I was given 2,500 points towards my Priority Club Gold account. The entire cost to me was $512 for a very bad experience.My suggestion is to STAY AWAY."
286,1789,Oct 18 2007 	No Class - Crowne Plaza Times Sq	Reservations made on hotel website 3 weeks prior to stay. At check in - told I could not have 2 double beds for myself and friend that all they had was a king. I said that was not acceptable and we were told we would have to wait (2+ hours) for room. Tried to charge $30. more per day but I had printed confirmation so that was changed from 599 to 569 for Thurs and 499 to 469 for Friday and also Sat night. Finally got to room and it was not the quality of room for the rates charged. When I complained to the manager I was told I did not qualify for a discount because I made the reservation online (at their website) and she could not do anything about the situation. Note: Do not make reservations on line. The Priority Club amounted to a key to the gym which I never used. The furniture had a drawer front removed with a room safe stuck inside and the refrigerator had been removed. The carpet was dirty. The employees of the hotel were great - very courteous and helpful. The food was ok. I stayed here 5 years ago and enjoyed because the hotel was convenient but this time it was the pits. Very expensive for the low quality rooms and amenities. I do not recommend this hotel unless major improvements are made.
287,1789,"Oct 16 2007 	A little run down...	I stayed at this property about 7 years ago on my last visit to NYC and thought it was a good value. The location is its best attribute as it is smack dab in the middle of Times Square and within walking distance of many attractions, including area theatres. However, this hotel is not what it used to be and is not a good value for the price. We booked a club level room for $469 per night which is steep by most people's standards. The nicest club floor amenity was definitely the afternoon cocktail appetizers and drinks served in the lounge. The breakfast was ok but pretty bare bones. The room itself was not up to par. The room was tiny and the bedding was ok, but not superior by any means. The bathroom shower drain did not work and was not in workable form the entire time we were there. I expect more for $469 per night. Upon arrival in our room, there was a letter stating that due to scheduled upgrades of the facility, it was possible that during most of the day there could be a man outside my window. How's that for privacy? Also, when I booked the room, I was assured that I would be able to get a late check-out on our last day and that was not honored. I felt that customer service was not adequate and neither was the room itself. If I had paid $200-250 per night, I would have been satisfied, but at the rate we paid, I was not pleased and will not return."
288,1789,"Oct 14 2007	Decent hotel good location but no special charm.	Booked this hotels for two nights on the Labor day week end. Got a corporate rate on the first night so that was worth it. Paid full price on the second, which is too much for what we got. But its Manhattan, so I'm a not complaining.Overall: decent room, great view onto Times Square. So centrally located. Quite a nice room. But it remains a big hotel, without any charm. This being said I am a bit biased as I spent the following 3 weeks in great little guesthouses in South Africa. So I might be comparing apples and oranges. It could really have gone either ways for the rating, 3 or 4, but at the end there was nothing really special about this place. If you get a corporate price it's a good deal. If not it's an average Time Square hotel I guess."
289,1789,"Oct 11 2007 	An Excellent Hotel All Around!	We won this hotel on Priceline for $160 a day, which was an incredible rate.The Crowne Plaza Times Square was exceptional from the moment we checked in the staff was warm and friendly. The clerk that checked us in would say hello daily and ask us about our day.The room was large by New York standards because it was a Priceline win we had 2 double beds which made for a larger room. The maid service and ammenities were exceptional. The bed was beyond comfortable and the room spotless.Yes, as other reviews have mentioned the hotel rooms do need a little updating/refreshing but it didn't take away from our enjoyment of the room. Check out my pictures....Thank you Crowne Plaza Times Sqaure for a wonderful 5 days. We can't wait to visit you again!!!"
290,1789,Oct 8 2007 	Class Class Class...	This hotel is a must for travellers who want a smack bang central location in Times Square. This place is class. The rooms are fantastic with spectacular views of Times Square. Good value too. Definitely going back to this hotel....
291,1789,Oct 1 2007 	Great location	We stayed at the hotel 15-18 September 2007 and paid 200 per night for a club room on the 36th floor.The room was fine the beds were very comfortable the only thing missing was a mirror in the bedroom.We had a couple of problems the main one being that the pool was closed for refurbishment while we were there and we had not been told in advance. The second was we wanted to use the business centre for online check in of our return flight which opened at 6.15pm but the business centre closes at 6pm and we were told to use the internet cafe round the corner. We did but felt the hotel should have offered the use of their facilities. The staff did not go out of their way to be helpful.Overall the hotel was good and in a great location for sightseeing/shopping however the staff/service was at best average.
292,1789,"Sep 26 2007	nice hotel great location	clean hotel, great location, friendly staff and great price through priceline. If you're a tourist in NYC, this hotel will work great for you and your family. we had no complaints."
293,1789,"Aug 19 2007	Crowne Plaza Manhattan...The perfect hotel choice!	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan for five nights from June 19-June24, 2007. This was my fourth time staying at the Crowne Plaza, and just like my previous stays, I had a fantastic experience. We arrived at the hotel well before check-in and was able to make it into our room around noon. The room itself was amazing. Not only was it clean and well kept, but the view of Times Square made the $400 per night charge well worth it. We were on the 23rd floor and must say that it was very quiet for our entire stay. The staff was friendly and very helpful making sure my needs as a hotel guest were met. If you're looking for a hotel that's located in the center of everything, then look no further than the Crowne Plaza. The hotel is right in Times Square and is in walking distance to many of the Broadway theaters. Not to mention, Rockefeller Center and 5th Ave are just several blocks away. You definitely can't beat the location! There are also lots of eating choices in the area, so you never have to be worried about looking for a place to eat. All in all, the Crowne Plaza Manhattan is the perfect hotel choice for anyone looking for a place to stay while in NYC. Yes, the price is a bit on the expensive side; however, after staying there, you'll realize that it's worth every penny!"
294,1789,"Aug 2 2007 	It was okay...not worth the money	The room wasn't bad, but for $300/night, I expected much more. I guess we were paying for the location. I've stayed at nicer Holiday Inn Express'. As a Priority Club member, I did get a few perks, but nothing to brag about. We had to kill 2 (flying) bugs in the room, which was odd since we were on the 26th floor. The beds were pretty comfy and the staff was helpful and friendly. I might stay there again for half the price."
295,1789,"Jul 29 2007 	Higher floors have good rooms	We had one of the good rooms on a high floor and it was excellent. Was a good view from up there too. Location is great and breakfast was decent. Staff was helpful. All in all, a fair priced Manhattan hotel is a good location. No bargain but you get what you pay for."
296,1789,"Jul 26 2007 	Hotel with Large variation in quality of rooms	A colleague and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza on a business trip that was booked and paid for by the company. Due to flight delays we arrived after 10 p.m. It seemed from the extended discussion at registration that the hotel was nearly full but with considerable pushing I was able to get an updated room on the 41st floor with a partial view of the Hudson River. My colleague accepted what she was given and ended up in a room that had obviously not been updated in years, had chunks taken out of the furniture, appeared to have not been cleaned recently and had only two bars of soap for amenities. She stayed that night but was at registration first thing the next morning requesting a change. The staff refused to believe the room was not updated and clean (had they looked at it?) but eventually and begrudgingly moved her during the day to an updated corner room on the 40th floor overlooking Broadway toward Time Square. The hotel was fine for the business meetings scheduled on the 15th floor with several meeting rooms available for small group division meetings. The breakfast, lunch and mid session snacks provided by the hotel were generally quite good (except for the one totally healthy snack afternoon when people from each group made a run across the street to the M+M store). The concierges were quite helpful with restaurant suggestions and making reservations. The restaurant in the hotel was good for a late night meal when we first arrived and the staff was even pleasant about staying open later than scheduled because of our late arrival.All in all, the Crowne Plaza was a decent hotel. It was a five or six block walk to the main theater district but the area is always lively and interesting. When I book my own travel I prefer to stay at the Marriott Marquis where I've always had better accommodations and service but this was certainly acceptable for a business trip when I wasn't paying."
297,1789,"Jul 17 2007 	rooms shabby but other areas i.e. lobby great	We changed room after one night the hairdryer and the wardrobe door were broken in 1st room. We were told they would move us the next day which they did but 2nd room was in worse condition. They only good thing about room was the beds were nice but then both my husband and daughter got bug bites while staying there... The good things were the staff were very helpful and the bar and lobby area was lovely, however I would prefer a better quality bedroom so would never stay with them again. I am sorry I didnt take photos as you would never believe from the furniture in bedroom that it was above a two star hotel."
298,1789,Jul 16 2007 	Great Location!	Everything about our experience was great. The room was very clean and provided a great view of Times Square. The concierge was very knowledgeable. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.
299,1789,"Jul 10 2007 	Central Location - So much so Close	Well you couldn't ask for anything more central for a start.Check in was handled well and fast. There are enough lifts never having to wait to long for a lift.Our room was on the 45th floor with views toward the Hudson river. The room was of good size, clean, large bed and Flat panel TV. The bathroom was a little dated but every thing worked and again clean. The room was very quiet which was nice to come back to after the hussell and bustle of outside!!. The AC unit in the corner though looked like it wouldn't handle hot weather to well. We did use it as during our stay, the hottest day on record for April was recorded in Central Park. We used the bar once and had dinner once in the hotel. They were fine but in general you don't normally worry about that with so much on offer out there!!. We had access to the Club Lounge on the 46th Floor which was handy for Teas &amp; coffees and snacks for breakfat in bed!.On the whole the staff were helpful and friendly (you always get one who's the exception). Value for money is an individual view I feel. We got what we thought was a good rate but certainly wouldn't pay the full tariff!!!.Its not the Westin but then its better than others.If you go Enjoy New York!"
300,1789,"Jul 1 2007 	Great location	Crowne Plaza is in a wonderful location if you want to walk to see a play, go to Rockefeller Center, shop on 5th Ave., see the sights in Times Square, enjoy Central Park, or catch a red bus for a tour of the city! It isn't a kid-friendly hotel . . . but who hangs out at their hotel when they are in New York City! If you are staying on the lower floors, the rooms are okay. I would only recommend staying their if you can get a good rate. I wouldn't be worth $300 or $400 per night."
301,1789,"Jun 20 2007 	Perfect location great view spacious rooms	The Crowne Plaza is directly located at the Times Square in Manhattan and not as many other hotels that claim to be at the Times Squares, but are in reality a block away. The hotel has a kind of stylish interior. The reception is a bit inconveniently located at the first floor, reachable through a stairway. The rooms are spacious and especially the corner rooms, AFAIK no upgrade necessary, are even nicer. Bathroom (in the niche of the main room) and toilet/shower are separated. Price for a one night stay from Sunday to Monday was 320 USD."
302,1789,"Jun 18 2007 	Very frustrating experience	My husband and I decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza because it was part of a good air/hotel package I booked through site59.com. On the Crowne Plaza Web site, the room and bed looked clean, fresh and nice; the &quot;sleep&quot; package was appealing, as was the large fitness center.What a disappointment. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we had one bad experience after another. There was a line to check in, and it appeared the front desk was under-staffed. After a 5 minute wait, the woman who checked us in at the front desk didn't greet us, just asked for our name and then stood there staring at the computer screen and occassionally clicking the mouse for 10 minutes without explaining what was happening or the reason for the delay.She told us she was putting us in a room with a king-sized bed, but it turned out to be 2 double beds. But the worst thing was that the room (2624), which was supposed to be non-smoking, REEKED of cigarette smoke. We asked for a room transfer and were told that the hotel was over-sold and our only option was a &quot;pilot's room&quot; with a Murphy bed and pull-out cot. So we stayed in our room but it was truly disgusting. The front desk told us they would send security up to our floor since someone must be smoking, but the smell didn't go away and was just as strong when we woke up the next morning. There was also a hair that wasn't ours in the soap dish in the shower.We asked for a room change again in the morning and the staff was very nice, and said they'd move us to a room with a king-sized bed; we just had to come to the front desk to get the key, and they'd move our bags from one room to the other for us. When we got to the front desk there was again a long line at the front desk. Thankfully a very nice woman at the concierge desk called a manager for us so we didn't have to wait in the line. A nice woman named Theresa came and gave us our new keys, but when we got to the new room - which, by the way, smelled just fine - it was again double beds, not the king beds we'd been promised. So we called Theresa and she brought us keys to a third room. About 30 minutes later the bellman showed up with our bags.This third room did have a king bed, and only a faintly bad odor - interestingly, this was also room #24 (though on the 36th floor), so we wondered if perhaps there was a ventillation problem with that part of the hotel. To be clear, 3624 didn't smell like smoke at all, and the odor was very faint, but still a bit off. Anyway, despite the fact that there were stains on the wall and that the wood was dramatically peeling off the dresser, this third room was fine. But at this point we had spent over an hour of our day dealing with the room change, not to mention the time spent unpacking and re-packing. When a hotel messes up enough to stick you in such a terrible smelling room, they should correct the situation much more gracefully and efficiently, and should get the room change right the first time.Then we went to the business center and the Internet connection was down.Later we paid to watch a movie and couldn't see the subtitles because the ratio of the TV display was set incorrectly and we weren't allowed access to adjust it.The &quot;sleep package&quot; that had appealed to me online was fine (lavendar sheet spray, eyemask, sleep CD) but ironically I found the beds pretty uncomfortable due to soft mattresses, but I know that's a matter of personal taste. The heavy curtains did a great job of keeping the room incredibly dark, though of course you're in Times Square so you can hear street noise, even 36 floors up. The fitness center was by far the highlight of our stay. It's a New York Sports Club and is huge - it has every piece of fitness equipment you could imagine, plus a full class schedule (aerobics, spin, yoga, etc) and a nice-looking lap-pool. We had free access through our site59.com package but it's usually $10 for hotel guests.The other plus was the central location - right by many subway stops that took us everywhere from Union Square to the Upper West Side in 5-10 minutes.Overall, though, a very stressful experience."
303,1789,"Jun 17 2007 	Excellent Stay	We live fairly close to New York and normally would not stay overnight but had wedding in City and did not want to drive home after. Were able to check in earlier, which was great since we needed room to change into our fancy clothes. Beautiful spacious, clean room overlooking Broadway. Noise was not an issue since the air conditioning was running. Coffee Maker in room very much appreciated. They provided real glasses and cups, which I think should be mandatory in a hotel rated 3*and higher. Lately, however, we have run into lots of 3* hotels providing plastic or paper cups. Parking was underneath hotel, $39 up to 24 hours, taxes included. Location is great for tourists for sightseeing and of course Broadway Shows. There are lots of City Tours leaving from the Times Square Area."
304,1789,"Jun 16 2007 	Very Nice Hotel Great Location	We stayed here April 17 - 22. We like having cool air available and the AC wasn't on until mid-week. Having snow a few days before was probably the reason. We had to call to have our window pried open; it was really stuck. We were on the 26th floor and loved the view of streets below. Noisy with the open window, but we're both big city kids so no problem getting to sleep. Being north of Times Square was nice as it gave us the chance to walk into the crowd rather than entering right into it. The closeness to the subway was a big plus. We took the train everywhere. We ate at the hotel restaurant once for lunch when we arrived before check-in and had to wait for our room to be ready. The food was great. I ate the breakfast buffet only once. Both times the food was excellent, but expensive ($20/lunch, $22/buffet). The room was two queens and was very nice and clean. Not having a fridge is a minus. The bathroom was of good size and the shower had more than enough pressure. We were worried after reading a few NYC reviews about water pressure and super small rooms that we would get something looking more like a cruise ship cabin, but we had plenty of room and water. The Brooks Theatre where we saw Moon for the Misbegotten was a short two blocks away and most of the restaurants we ate at were within easy walking distance. Side note: 2 months after being there I can still taste the great food we ate. I have never been in a city where every restaurant serves such delicious foods. The elevators are in two sets; upper floors and lower-middle floors. This kept the elevator waits to a minimum. The staff that we had contact with were friendly and helpful. This being our first visit to NYC we found their friendliness very relaxing after a busy day of site seeing. If our room had a mini-bar I probably would give an excellent rating. I don't fault the hotel for not having their central AC on since April can be so unpredictable. I wrote a Trip Report in The Independent Traveler web site, if you wish to read details of our New York City vacation."
305,1789,"Jun 14 2007 	Stellar Hotel!	I was very impressed with the service at the Crowne Plaza. I booked a package deal through a website. I was happy with the room. Crowne Plaza hotels are featuring a spa experience with a gift waiting for you in your room with an eye mask, some lavender linen spray, a relaxation CD and earplugs. Normally you need these if the city noises would keep you awake at night, but we didn't hear any outside noise in our room. The staff was great and the after hours security was impressive. Late night, there was a security guard checking that you had a valid room key and there was a second guard doing the same at the elevators.....a real peace of mind for women and families traveling. The lobby was under construction, but who cares. The beds were SOOOOOO COMFORTABLE and the room was big for NYC standards. Other family members were staying at the Hyatt Grand Central and the Crowne Plaza beat it hands down. The only policy that I didn't care for was that they charge an administrative fee if you want a late check out. When you're paying a room rate over $200 per night, I think you should be allowed a late checkout without incurring a fee."
306,1789,"Jun 10 2007 	Great Hotel.... my favorite in Manhattan	This is the second time I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square, and again, I had an excellent stay. We booked a room in the Executive Club level. It was well worth the extra money. The continental breakfast was very nice as was the evening hor d'oeuvres time.They gave us a corner room on the 42nd floor. The view was toward the east and north and was great. The room was everything that we needed for a nice stay in New York. It was roomy and the 32&quot; flat scrteen TV was great after a long day in the city.The fitness center was first class. The service the same for the most part.I have read the reviews here before booking. I did a bed bug check when we arrived ( I do this in all NYC hotels) and found no evidence of anything that day or any evidence of past problems. The hair dryer in the bath room did not work, and within minutes, a new one arrived at the door.The hotel is not cheap.... and nor is the service or the property. The security at night was great. I saw a young couple try to snow the guard into letting them onto the elevator without a key, but he was having none of it. For the most part everyone was helpful; and professional. We attended three Broadway plays that weekend and this hotel was no more than two minutes walk from any one them.The bed was great after an intense day in the city and the room temp controlled nicely. The room amentities were entirely satisfactory.If I had to report a negative thing it is very minor...the bartender in the executive lounge was absolutely miserable one night. That is a shame also, since I am a 20% tipper when the service is good and a 0% tipper when the service is bad. I take this very seriously. I do have one regret on my part....I was late in getting to the train station and in my rush, I forgot to tip the housekeeper. I need to find out how to rectify that.This is a premium hotel in my experience. You pay for it. To me it was well worth it and this has become my hotel of choice when I stay in Manhattan."
307,1789,"May 31 2007 	Great location clean and comfortable - loved it!	We stayed for the weekend 18th to 21st May 2007. On arrival, the wait to check in was short and as we were travelling with friends who were booked in a room on the Club Level, the receptionist very kindly upgraded us so we could enjoy the benefits too! We did have to wait an hour for our room to be cleaned, but that was no hardship. All the staff we encountered were polite and friendly.It was our friend's birthday and they called us to their room to help with the plate of cheese and crackers and bottle of wine they found on their return, along with a birthday card from the lovely receptionist - which was a nice suprise!Our room on 46th floor had a great view of the Hudson and was spacious and clean. The bed was about 7 feet wide and very comfortable. We were supposed to have access to a dedicated concierge but we never saw anyone manning the desk. The Club Lounge was a great place to have a drink before venturing out for the night and the continental breakfast was good too.The area around the hotel is busy 24 hours a day, it was reassuring to have our room cards checked every evening before we could access the lifts.We were able to check in online for our return flights in the business centre and as we used the facilities for only 5 mins, this was complimentary.We would definitely stay here again as the location is great and so near theatres and places to eat - we loved the Stage Deli a few blocks up."
308,1789,"May 21 2007 	Excellent location	Booked this hotel due to the location and we were not disappointed. Situated in Times Square and in the heart of Broadway, so busy no space to move on the streets. We were two ladies and due to location felt completely safe returning to the hotel late at night. We stayed on the 20th floor, did not have a great view from the window however we were only there for 4 days so were not planning on staying in the roomn much!! We had read previous reviews about bedbugs and were therefore a bit worried, however we didn't experience any problems. Unfortunately due to limited time we were not able to use or see any of the hotel facilities. If you are in New York to sight see or shop then this hotel is definately a must."
309,1789,"May 18 2007 	Good location OK hotel	Due to the very large choice of hotels in the area, I read many reviews before making my booking (it was for my wife's birthday and I wanted it to be special - on that count it didn't quite achieve). The location is really good, just a few minutes from Times Square and even closer to a subway station. General condition of the rooms was fine, although we were led to believe that the hotel had been renovated in 2006 - this obviously did not include new wall paper or carpet, and definitely not the bathroom. The bath was one of those short, dumpy baths you get quite often in Middle Easten hotels, not really acceptable these days. Also, the up escalator to reception was not working for the duration of our stay (4 days), so you had to get a lift from round the corner.Having said that, the service in the hotel was really good. The gym was well equipped, even if it did close rather early on a Sunday. No real complaints about the hotel, it was adequate, well positioned and clean - I'd just probably try somewhere else should I visit New York again as I've stayed in better 4* hotels."
310,1789,"May 15 2007 	Great Location Great View Good Room	Mt wife &amp; I stayed on the 42nd floor of the Crowne Plaza on May 1-4 2007 to celebrate our 20th anniversary. We paid extra for an &quot;Executive Level&quot; room, which means a room on the 42nd floor or higher, complimentary breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres, and access to the 46nd floor lounge (where breakfast &amp; evening snacks were served).We supposedly had a river/harbor view room, but we had to search hard to find the harbor or river off in the distance. Still, the room did have a great view of the surrounding area, with no large buildings nearby. The room itself was average sized, but the bathroom was very hard to enter as the door leading to the bathroom opened outward into a very cramped sink area.The room had a nice setup with a large desk (with plentiful and easily accessible electrical outlets), a large flat panel television and comfortable bed. We did not have any problems with bedbugs as some other travelers have reported (although we are now hesitant to go back after reading those reports).Overall, we were satisfied with the hotel and the room. Our major complaint was that the escalators were broken every day that we stayed at the hotel.We plan to return NYC sometime, but will probably stay at a hotel further from hustle of Times Square."
311,1789,"May 8 2007	Beware -- second incident shards of glass on 42nd floor lobby	Be careful walking in this hotel on the guest floors. I came back to this hotel after an incident of shards of glass on my room floor and gave it another chance. It has less expensive corporate rates than other hotels in the area and saves my client money.Waiting in the lobby for the elevator after 5 pm, I noticed tens of shards of glass scattered in the 42nd floor lobby. At 7 am the next morning, the glass was still there. I showed the manager. Coming back at 6:30 pm, they still missed a few pieces of glass.If someone walked without shoes on the floor for ice, they could have been in for an unpleasant surprise.This hotel need more responsible management. Maybe someone from corporate will read this."
312,1789,"May 4 2007 	Times Square location - Beware of bed bugs!!!!!!!!!	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights in Times Square and came home with bed bugs in my luggage. I contacted the hotel and they are telling me that they had professionals check my room and it came up clean. When I asked for a copy of the report, was told they would not provide it. I have endured costly expenses due to their negligence.Stay at Crowne Plaza - Times Square at your own risk!!!!!!!!!!"
313,1789,"Apr 25 2007 	Look Out for the Bed Bugs	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square April 10-14, 2007 for a business trip. I reserved a king non-smoking, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was put into a room that had a DOUBLE bed that FOLDED OUT OF THE WALL (room 2823). The room was teeny tiny and had adjoining rooms on each side. I could sit on the end of the bed and my knees would touch the television stand (and I am only 5'7&quot;). The hotel had not turned on air conditioning yet (the hotel only turns it on during summer months) and the room was very warm. The window opened about 3 inches, but would not stay open so I had to prop it open with the guest services book. So the room was small and hot and I could hear my neighbors conversation verbatim?? Okay, I can get over that, I am basically there just to sleep, right, and besides, this is on my company's dime, not mine. Not as easy at it sounds.....That first night, the bed was basically like sleeping on a box spring, hard and uncomfortable. And I noticed that my legs were really itchy!! I thought I was either having a reaction to the laundry detergent used on the sheets, or the soap products the hotel carries.The next morning I requested that I be moved to a different room because I was so displeased with room 2823. I was told I would not be moved unitl the 3rd day because the hotel was full. Fine, I thought, I can stand one more night of hearing the shrill laughter of my neighbors at 2 a.m. and my legs itching like mad. On the third morning, I was moved to room 2815. Just a few doors down the hall but a world of difference from room 2823!! I got a king size bed and much more room. And the room's temperature was acceptable and there were no adjoinging rooms...hooray! I was much happier....But the itchy legs continued, and by this time, the itch had moved up to my stomach and arms. On the morning of my departure, I was sitting on my bed putting on my shoes. I felt another bite and looked at my arm where I found a bug, similar in appearance to an appleseed, biting me. I smashed it and thought nothing more of it. I had never seen a bedbug, and besides, aren't they just the lure of a childhood rhyme?? WRONGThe bites still continued when I got home and again, I found a stupid bug (just like the first one) on my leg. Now I was really perplexed as to why I had seen this same bug at the Crowne Plaza and now again on my leg. I did some reseach on the internet, low and behold, I had discovered BEDBUGS!!! Yes, freaking BEDBUGS traveled back to North Carolina with me. I had never seen a bedbug in my life until my stay at the Crowne Plaza, and now they are making me and my home their own personal feeding trough. I am going to have to get an exterminator now and who knows what that is going to cost? I don't, not yet anyway, but I bet it's not going to be cheap.Thanks a lot Crowne Plaza, for your univited Begbugs guests and my future extermination bill. BEWARE of rooms 2823 and 2815. And by the way, I informed the hotel, they have not responded to my complaints. Also, a co-worker stayed in room 2723 (just below my original room, but her's was a double, much larger and had only one adjoining room) and so far she has not been affected by bedbugs.

The pool was disapointing very old hat streem room did not work or was not turned on the trainer was not intrested in finding out the stay in new was good and the location of the hotel was good as well but i would not stay there again no fridge. only one bath robe per roon asked for second did not arrive and the bath room was design for circus people very small . orverall a very old out dated hotel ideal for buniess
315,1789,"Apr 23 2007 	OK	We stayed for 6 nights in April - family of 4 including 2 teenagers.Hotel fulfilled our requirement to be in a high level room in Times Square, for the first time visit to NYC for our kids. The Club Room was not large enough for the four of us, although reservations had assured me that it would be fine.Supposedly refurbished room was just OK. Room service was OK.Pool a big disappointment - fine if you want to train only, but not for fun swimming, which is normally part of our family holiday - and was one of the reasons we chose this hotel over any other.Very much a business hotel. Don't think we saw or spoke to any one person twice over the course of our stay. No-one really cared who we were, or what we were doing there, or if we were having a good time. No personal touch at all.Served it's purpose, but certainly wouldn't rush back."
316,1789,"Apr 18 2007 	Good hotel in a good area	The hotel is ideal for visiting NY. Is in the heart of NY handy for Central park and Financial District.Tub stops are close to the hotel.Check in was ok. Not particularly friendly the girl, but professional.Room was ok (we paid for a room from the 22nd to the 44th floor).Breakfast is ok. There is a good choice of food (but Im Italian so Im used to a Continental breakfast).Concierge service is good.We did not used room service or other facilities."
317,1789,"Apr 15 2007 	Staff very unfriendly..!!	From Australia we travelled far to see wonderful NYC. Tired and hungry we were greeted with a very unwelcoming stance by hotel staff. Good location but all facets of hotel room, service, staff and food are not up to standards by all 'hotel means'! Planning another trip '08 definately will NOT stay here!"
318,1789,"Apr 13 2007 	One of the best choices in Times Square	Among NYC hotels, this one, along with the Time Square Hilton, are two of the very best I've stayed at. The only issue with this hotel is the check in lines, which are often very long and somehow progress slower than other hotels (much much slower). The rooms are clean, up to date, with nice furniture and housekeeping does a nice job (compared to some other NYC hotels). The noise level is suprisingly low, especially considering how booked this hotel usually is. The location is fantastic. It has a nice lounge which tends to get very busy, but is very convenient. The staff all seemed very helpful and I noted there seemed to be a high security presence monitoring the public areas. I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you can get it via [--] for reasonable rates."
319,1789,"Apr 12 2007 	No faults to report	Stayed for 2 nights late March on the 46th Floor as we are Priority Club Members, this hotel was free with our Priority Points. We were also given access to the Club Lounge where we had free snacks &amp; drinks late in the afternoon and a lovely buffet continental breakfast. I have stayed on Time Square before and have always been able to hear the hussle and bussle below but not on the 46th floor of the Crowne Plaza, very quiet indeed.Extremely comfortable bed.Excellent quick check inNo problems to report at all."
320,1789,"Apr 5 2007	A Waste of a Great Location	This hotel was a major disappointment. It's in a great location at Times Square. Unfortunately, I confirm the other reviewers who said that checking in was a frustrating, time-consuming hassle, which is not a good way to start. I also confirm that the plumbing is antiquated and the drains run slow. Room service moves at the speed of moving glaciers. The posted signs for when the bar and restaurant are open are strictly for decoration and are meaningless. Other reviewers have said the bar and restaurant open late, in my case they closed over half an hour early, causing us major headaches. Add in sparsely and tastelessly furnished rooms and bare corridors, and you can't help but feel sad at what a waste this precious real estate is."
321,1789,"Mar 29 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	I have stayed at dozens of hotels in the city in almost every area of Manhattan. This one makes the top 5 list for me. The hotel is conveniently located in Times Square - great for business or tourist travel. I had a room on the executive floor with free access to the club lounge for breakfast and reception. I was treated great from the time I walked in until checkout. The rooms are very nice with great beds and a flat screen television. The health club is very nice, but it is close enough to the park to do your exercise there (highly recommended). I will choose this hotel again if the price is right."
322,1789,"Mar 29 2007 	Great Service in the Big Apple	My husband and I stayed in the Crown Plaza near Times Square for my birthday weekend. Upon arrival the receptionists were very friendly and helpful. Our room was ready for us and since they knew it was my birthday, they left a bottle of chilled champagne and a full, delicious birthday cake! It was VERY good! Our entire weekend was very nice. We were never disturbed by any pushy maids or thin walls. The shower was great, the host at the bottom of the escalator was always helpful and everyone seemed relaxed and friendly. Thank you, Crown Plaza, for making my birthday memorable!"
323,1789,"Mar 13 2007 	Nice Hotel	Stayed here November 10-15, 2006. LocationThis hotel is located in the heart of time square. Standing in front of it you can lok to the right and see where the ball drops on new years eve. Wayne Brady was staying their during our stay, a friend saw him getting on the elevator. There was a reunion of the broadway show &quot;Chicago&quot;. Walking distance to attractions, I saw the Color Purple. Very good show.DiningBreakfast buffet $25.00 Pancakes were not very good.

324,1789,"Mar 4 2007	Great location - very comfortable	Hotel is a great location!Staff are very helpful and friendly. Food was good. Room was superb with a giant Widescreen LCD TV and excellent views from the 43rd floor.As a Platinum Priority club member, I was allowed access to the club lounge on the 47th Floor. Here, there was complementary breakfast and cocktails in the evenings.If you want to stay somewhere with the best overall Manhattan location, then you'd be hard pushed to find a better hotel.You are 2 minutes walk to the heart of Times Square and 4 minutes from the Times Square Subway station.I will definelty be back!"
325,1789,"Mar 2 2007	Great Location...	My friend and I got a room through priceline.com. It was a great deal ($150/night). The hotel is right in the middle of Times Square. We got a room on the 32nd floor with a view of all the excitement Time Square has to offer. The room was very clean and the staff was friendly. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but it was a great experience."
326,1789,"Mar 1 2007	fab hotel Great location	Stayed here in February for 4 nights with my husband and two girls. Was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews, but on arrival the staff couldnt have been nicer and check in was very fast. We had a beautiful on the room on the 17th floor overlooking Times Square, what a view. The room was spotless. I would deffinately recommend this hotel and if travelling to Ny again I would stay here again."
327,1789,"Mar 1 2007 	My Engagement ... A Special Trip ..	Simon, London, England.My girlfriend and I stayed at the Crown Plaza on Time Square, New York from 21st - 25th February, 2006. The trip was a surprise for my girlfriend and while in NY I asked her to marry me.Review:Overall we had a very nice stay at the hotel. It is rated as a 4.5* hotel and there are some noticable features that justify this rating. The hotel is is an excellent location and is right on Time Square. The hotel staff are friendly and attentive and the hotel is vey clean and comfortable.The hotel begins on the 16th floor and rises upto around 50 floors. Floors 30 and above command a higher rate, due to the view, but are basically the same inside. We were on the 42nd floor and had a king sized bed, a fantastic view and tons of room within the room.For a 4.5* hotel you get what you expect, such as nice coffee, moisturiser, a dressing gown, loads of towels and excellent room service. The bathroom was quite small, but enough room for two people to be in there at the same time, although sadly not enough room for two in the bath together ; - )The 42'' plamsa screen was excellent. Great choice of films, music and shows on interactive, but with a 4.5* hotel, there were the usual 4.5* prices.I told the hotel I was proposing on the second night (she said Yes, btw!) and they put a punnet of strawberries and some champagne in our room that evening when we got back - a lovely touch.Anyone who stays in this hotel will have a very nice time. Just manage your own expectations before you arrive. One/two waords of warning:Room Service - the price for food delivered to the room is extortionate!!! About 14.00 for two cokes and a plate of chips. DO NOT order room service unless you are very rich!The Shower - I've stayed in NY 4 times before and the showers are always crap in large hotels. This is no exception. Baths are of course fine but allow time to run this, water pressur ein general is crap in NY.Extra Taxes - when you check out of the hotel you WILL be charged for taxes that other hotels include. These ammount to around $20 / 10 per night, nothing ridiculous but be warned.Overal the staff are friendly, doorman are good, hotel is clean and there is a Starbucks in the day that turns into a bar in the evening. Everything in the hotel is expensive, buy you expect that in a Crown Plaza.The pool is on 15th floor and is about 14meters long, it's divided into 5 lanes, you have to stay in your lane, they only allow 2 people at one time in a lane. If stayin in the hotel they throw out (literally) users who are members of the pool for you. It is a little embaressing, but pool mmebers know that hotel guests come first.best advice I can give is to stay don't say here if this is your first trip to NY. You'l be out all the time walking about. if you've been afew times before, know the city and want to have a good time without coming back buggered then this is a great hotel to stay at! last point - check all the travel web sites AND call the hotel directly, prices really vary!!!"
328,1789,Feb 18 2007	heart of times sq	Stayed at this hotel twice -The location is great right in the heart of Times Sq and easy to use as a base. Is quite corporate as you'd expect but didn't feel out of place as NYC is very busy / fast pace - views in the night are amazing seeing Times Sq all lit up.Would not hesitate using this hotel again. I Love NYC
329,1789,Feb 16 2007 	Excellent Location	Excellent location right in the heart of New York. Very clean room. Speedy check in. Plenty of space for all of the New York shopping. Friendly and helpful concierge. Did not get a chance to sample the restaurant as there are so many places to eat in New York. Had a view of the indoor pool from our room.
330,1789,"Feb 12 2007 	Fantastic hotel great service	We stayed here for four nights as a birthday surprise for my girlfriend. Check in was fantastic (Thanks Maureen) the staff were unbelievably helpful and freindly. We had booked an upgrade to the Club floor level and were placed on the 43rd floor. The windows took up both walls (we were on a corner) giving us a view of central park, and of time square. The room was fantastic, plenty of space, large bathroom, a huge 50 inch plasma screen TV, and the biggest bed i have ever seen in my entire life. The room was also warm and comfortable, so absolutely no complaints.On the night of my girlfriends birthday, as we were getting ready to go out, a bottle of champagne along with starwberries dipped in chocolate with cream, were sent to the room with a happy birthday card compliments of Maureen on the front desk, which was a very kind touch, and made the whole experience complete.The hotel was ideally located for everything that we wanted to do, and the staff couldnt have been more helpful. I would certainly not hesitate to stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to anyone. We were a little apprehensive after reading other reviews but i have to say that our stay was nothing short of superb, and an experience i look forward to again."
331,1789,"Feb 7 2007	The reviews are so wrong!!!	I was so afraid when booking the Crown Plaza after I read the reviews. I called and upgraded our room to club level and requested a broadway view. We arrived At 12:30pm and went straight to our room and the checkin was a breeze the staff was very friendly. We had room 4402. It was a corner room with the entire room almost being windows. one side faced the Hudson river and the other side was Time Square. The only problem was our view was slightly obstructed on the time square side due to a brick wall. But overall it was a fantastic room. Very large and more space than we needed. It was very clean and the towels were very large unlike what I had read in an earlier review. My friend forgot her toothbrush and we called the front desk and in less than 2 minutes someone was knocking on our door with the toothbrush and toothpaste. We had access to the Club lounge for breakfast and evening drinks and snacks and both were very good. Breakfast is not hot food just muffins, ceral and bagels. But was perfect for us. I would definitly stay here again!!! it is so close to everything and is very nice. I would recommend upgrading to the club level."
332,1789,"Jan 30 2007 	Good location bad room	Stayed on the 21st floor in January. Reception and coffee bar had been refurbished nicely but when entering the room, didn't have the impression at all staying in a Crowne Plaza! The room looked not maintained since the 80th and carpet had big stains. The heating system got switched off at night time, room was freezing cold. Amenities: No shower gel and no bathroom slippers or bathrobe. The only positive thing of the room was the very comfortable mattress.Lady-supervisor at breakfast was unfriendly and interfered impolitley when approaching a waiter who served us the previous day. Best of the hotel: Bell associates were very friendly and helpful, special thanks to Eric for the good service! At breakfast they serve fresh orange juice as much you like. You are straight at Time Square and 2 min walk away from the subway station.All in all not worth to pay a call in rate of $269 +tax as you can find a better experience for less money. My recommendation: Check out &quot;The Time&quot; next door."
333,1789,"Jan 19 2007 	Really Bad service....	The hotel has a great location and the rooms are a good size. I am a big fan of the Crown Plaza chane in europe however, the staff in this hotel made it one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. reception was rude and unhelpful, waiters were unatentive. this was made up for by the security staff and porters who were really good. However the final straw was the maids. it is the only hotel i have ever stayed in that phoned the room at 9.30 in the morning to ask when you were leaving so they could clean the room, and this was not even on the day we were checking out.!!!"
334,1789,"Jan 7 2007 	Don't stay just for the POOL!!	My family stayed at this location for one night before the tree at Rockafeller Center was taken down. From the outside, the hotel looks great and is located in a prime location - literally 3 blocks from Rockafeller center. Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square with plenty of sights to see.We picked this hotel mainly because it is one of the few in NYC that has a pool. Since we were traveling with two children ages 7 and 8 it is always good to have in case of bad weather, etc. Upon entering the lobby, we were impressed, very nicely decorated, clean, and rather impressive. Check in was fine and even though I booked a room that was to be on the 44-46 floors, I was placed on the 42nd. No big deal there, still had club access. I believe that this is a waste of money. We did not use it enough to make it worth the extra money paid.We had two rooms each with 2 double beds. My room had a fabulous view of the river and the cruise ships, One of the major problems was that the window would not close, so the wind would be howling and whistling until the engineers came up to close it. Our other room had the same trouble with their window as well. The room was a good size, bedding was not up to par with Marriott, and was a little on the hard side. The room appeared to be renovated, but the bathroom was an obviously last done in the 80's. Dark Brown painted cabinets, flourescent lighting in the ceiling, mirrors everywhere, and old fixtures. Clean but just not new or updated. The biggest complaint I had with the room is that the entire hotel turns off it's air conditioning in the fall and doesn't let you cool your room until they turn it back on in the spring. However, when we were there it was over 60 degrees during the day and the room was so hot that it was nearly impossible to sleep at night. I was able to open up the window about an inch but it did not cool anything. So, a couple nice days and you may be very uncomfortable. And there is nothing that you can do about it. However, the other room that we had that was down the hall was not as warm, so maybe the temperature varies in the different rooms? The kids were excited to go to the pool which was on the 15th floor. So we went. That was when we realized that we were going to an actual NY Sports Club not just a pool for the hotel. Upon checking in at the front desk the kids were given &quot;swim caps&quot; that were mandatory. ??? They had never been asked to wear those before. Anyway, the pool was about 20 feet long and 4 lanes wide. There was a lovely (NOT) lady that appeared to dislike when children use the pool. She told them to stop at everything they were doing. No Kidding. They couldn't do anything without getting the evil eye or a warning. It was not very fun for them nor was it relaxing for us. We left after 20 minutes or so. SO if you are staying at this hotel for the pool DON'T. Stay at Le Meridian, or another hotel. All in all it was a decent stay for 1 night. Would I stay here again, probably not. There are many other hotels in the area that are cheaper and nicer. Sure they may not have a pool, but maybe there are enough things to do that you don't need a pool anyway."
335,1789,"Jan 5 2007 	A Great Place to Stay!	Having read the mixed reviews, I was a bit cautious in booking this hotel. but after spending 2 nights, I can honestly say that my stay was a great experience, and I would definately recommend this hotel. The staff could not have been nicer. the staff at the front desk was friendly and courteous, and bumped us up to a King room on the 31st floor (room 3108). The room was very neat and clean ( my wife scheves everything, and she loved it!). For a NYC hotel, it was a decent size, plenty of room to spread out. The only thing that we found wrong was that on the first night, the room was very warm. there is no AC in the winter, so we cracked open a window, and it wasnt so bad. the second night was much better. If you are looking for a clean hotel, with a friendly staff, in the middle of everything, for a price that is the same as many other hotels of MUCH lower quality, then this is your place. Of course, If your looking for Pomp and circumstance, then go stay at a 5 star $800 per night hotel. this was perfect for my wife and I! We would definately stay again"
336,1789,"Jan 3 2007 	Do not recommend	I had a &quot;renovated&quot; room booked at the Crowne Plaza but when I got in the room is was clearly not renovated. The room was dirty, the linens were of poor quality and the bathroom was small, stained, and old. I called the front desk thinking there had been a mistake but the receptionist told me that I was in a &quot;renovated room.&quot; At that point I called my travel agent and for the first time ever (and I travel atleast a few times a month for business) decided to check out the hotel and stay in another hotel. (My travel agaent booked me another room at the Hilton in Times Square, which I highly recommend). When I went down to the front desk and told the manager that I would like to check out because I was unhappy with the room they still charged me the cancellation fee. Overall the manager and staff were rude and inflexible. In fact, there were 2 other people arguing with the manager when I walked in the lobby. I would not recommend this hotel at all. There are many nicer hotels for the same price (the Hilton is much nicer and even cheaper)."
337,1789,"Dec 29 2006 	Great location	My daughter and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza during our visit to New York. The staff was a little less than pleasant. No one helped us with our luggage. Room was small but very clean. The bedding was comfortable, even though we never received the little extras like lavender spray, etc. that we were supposed to. Our room was either hot or very cold not comfortable. They cut the air conditioning system off in Sept. so if for some reason you have 65 degree days like we had in December you are a little warm. We opened our window then could not get it closed completely and it got very cold at night. We did enjoy the location of the Crowne. Felt safe at night, you have to show your room keys before entering the hotel. We had an enjoyable time just expected a little more."
338,1789,"Dec 27 2006 	Liked the Crowne Plaza	3 families stayed at Crowne Plaza TS from 12/21-12/23. No complaints. All 3 rooms were clean and decent size. Location was great, central to everything. Hotel was very quiet. We were on the 24th floor and didn't hear any outside noise.The only complaint I have with this hotel is that I left my pillow in the room upon checkout. When I realized I had left my pillow I contacted the hotel and there was no report of my pillow being left in the room. After leaving the city ,approximately 10 minutes later, I was contacted by phone that my pillow was found and I would need to pay for them to deliver it to me. I don't know why it took them 5+ hours to find the pillow after the room was cleaned. Also I have left items behind before and the hotel has always sent my items at their expensise not mine! I thought this was very tacky and could be a reason why I wouldn't stay at a hotel of this chain again."
339,1789,"Dec 25 2006 	Wonderfull Room Terrific View Skip the Restaurant	We had a wonderful room on the 45th floor looking over Times Square. The view was fabulous, the amenities are great, with a wonderful continental breakfast and lounge upstairs. The service was exemplary and the staff was helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel. However, DO NOT eat at the on premises restaurant &quot;Samplings&quot; the food was awful and the service was just okay. There are dozens of far better places to eat near by, try the Edison Cafe, Maxie's deli, Ruby Foos or any of a number of Italian or ethnic cuisines nearby, you will be much happier that way."
340,1789,"Dec 18 2006 	Nice - Great Value for the Rate Booked for One Night on Hotwire	Booked a great rate on Hotwire just a few days before for one night only. The Crowne Plaza is a great location for seeing shows. We did not stay there long to take advantage of everything and for the price we got on Hotwire, it was a great deal. My only complaint is that upon check in, we were not asked our preference for smoking/non-smoking and were given a smoking room. We were running late and didn't have time to change rooms. Other than that, the room was large by New York standards, the bathroom was clean, and the bed was comfortable. What more can you ask? The hotel bar and restaurant seemed a bit sterile but all you have to do is step outside and there you are in the hustle and bustle. Staff was friendly enough with what little contact I had with them. No doorman to help us get a cab."
341,1789,"Dec 16 2006 	Only stay at a bargain rate	I must say that my recent stay at The Crowne Plaza left me a little disappointed. My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights and, due to the time of year, were paying pretty much the full rate, and that is where the disappointment comes in. Considering the bargains often available, we felt somewhat short-changed from our stay at this hotel.But let's be fair, it has it's plus points. For a start the location really is excellent. The subway station is across the street and allows easy access to both downtown (Macy's, Empire State Building etc) and cross-town (5th Avenue, Park Avenue and the like). During December the streets are so busy that even a five or six block walk is worth taking the subway for. Also, the door staff and security people are very pleasant. They help with bags and offer advice on the city in a very cheerful manner. On checking in the reception staff were swift and courteous and accomodated us without hassle when we requested a slight change in our booking requirements. The coffee bar in the lobby is very handy and tasty and again manned by friendly staff. The room was clean and the maid service visited regularly.Sadly, that's about it for the plus points...So what was so wrong? Although the room was small it was no smaller than any other NYC hotel room, but for obvious reasons the window didn't open (I assume that they frown on people or objects being ejected from the 34th floor). This would be fine if the room was air conditioned, but we had the option of heat or nothing. The room was stifling and the air con only operates in the summer months so a comfortable night's sleep was tricky.Also there was a very strange nylon bedcover (hang on a second before you think that I'm whining for no reason). This cover gave off the most amazing static charge and we found that everything we touched gave us mild shocks. This was funny for about two hours and then became quite trying. The first night I pushed the cover off and we could actually see little blue sparks coming off my fingers (after the second &quot;Emperor-from-Return-of-the-Jedi&quot; joke, my girlfriend decided I was less funny than I thought I was). The bath plug was broken (as in could not be put in the plug-hole (or drain for our American cousins)) and we reported it on our first morning - it was never fixed. The shower was fine but that wasn't really the point. Still, after your shower you could use one of their finest towels, providing you are of diminutive stature or don't wish to cover your modesty by wearing it round your waist. These were the smallest hotel towels I have ever experienced. I did get a larger towel one day (just by luck), but this one became known as &quot;the runway strip&quot; as it was twice the length of the others but half the width (I look good in a mini-skirt, apparently - ha ha!). Facecloths were replaced as and when the maid felt like it, so that was a bit of a lottery.The other main gripe that I had was that the hotel bar closed at midnight. We trundled in one evening at 12.15am and decided to have a nightcap only to be told that they were closed. Room service also shut down at midnight so we ended up (more on general principal than anything) asking where we could get a bottle of wine. We were directed to a store a couple of blocks away and told that it could be recognised by the fact that it sold flowers and they were all in front of it. My girlfriend quickly (and amusingly) pointed out to the staff member the irony that we could get flowers from a store a 12.30am but not a bottle of wine from our hotel. On receiving our stony silence in response, we went walking, found the store but it only sold beer (any port in a storm, eh?). &quot;City that never sleeps&quot;? Apparently, &quot;City that never sleeps except for in December in the Times Square area&quot;.The final gripe was that after the pleasurable check-in experience (Thank you to Nathan at the desk), the desk staff seemed a little surly, and in one instance had a whole conversation with me without looking up from the computer screen).In summary (if you waded through this far), stay at The Crowne Plaza if you get a great room rate. It has beds (a bit sparky but hey...), cupboards, water and warmth and it's NYC so you're not going to be in the room for long anyway. Otherwise, look elsewhere, I expect you'lll get a better standard of visit for the same money.smilemuch1970@hotmail.com"
342,1789,"Dec 10 2006 	Pleased: Fantastic Gym Situation and a Spotless Room	I was very nervous about my stay at the Crowne Plaza. I travel to NYC a lot and had never known anyone who had stayed there, and I was not the least bit familiar with the chain. With room rates astromonical this past week, I decided to give this place a try rather than my normal hotel hang outs. Well here are the pluses: First all guests have access to a spectacular gym for $10.00. (more on this below). Second the room was spotless especially the bathroom which had a very clean feel. The bathroom amenties were also above average. Third, the bedding was comfortable and attractive. I was told they just replaced the bedding in the hotel. Fourth there were plenty of outlets for the business road warrior with electronic gadgets despite my having a small room. Fifth, the desk area is very functional. Six: the cable has a good selection including CNBC. Finally the front desk staff was very friendly and even the hallways were clean and decently lit.As for the gym, it was heaven. Yes you have to share it with outside members but there is a plethora of equipment with individual tvs, a great class schdule and a decent size pool. I would give the weight and cardio section A and A+ respectively, and I am a tough grader. The gym is actually free to frequent guests in the hotel's loyalty program.As for the negatives the room was small (like many NYC hotel rooms). The bed was very low to the ground and small - it was queen size at best versus a normal king size option. My bed choice may have been limited with the low rate I happened to be paying. Personally the low to the ground bed did not bother me and as I noted above the linens were clean and comfortable. However a large person or two people could have been uncomfortable. Second the towels in the bathroom were a little on the small side and not super plush. They were far from horrible but just not above average.Other tidbit: I was told at the front desk that the hotel was recently sold and may have more positive renovation changes to come. I did not check out any of the meal options so I cannot comment about the food or opportunity for food in the hotel.."
343,1789,"Dec 6 2006 	Great hotel for a great price	Loved the Crowne Plaza in NYC. Great location, great staff and great price. The beds were almost too comfortable since we found it difficult to get up in the mornings. Very quiet considering it's located in Times Square. The staff allowed us into our room early (check-in is at 3pm) and kept our baggage at no charge.Overall a great exeperience. Highly recommended."
344,1789,"Dec 6 2006 	I should have stuck to my promise to never stay there again..	I have to admit that I have somewhat of a love- hate view of this hotel. The previous time I stayed at the hotel, which was about the 4th time I had stayed here, I said I would never stay there again.The reason was that I found the attitude of the staff from the abrasive check-in staff through to the restaurant staff so poor. I felt the rooms for the price were not good value. Add in the heavy crowds around the area and even in the lobby and was all a bit too much of an unpleasant experience.I decided that this was going to be inevitable for a hotel with over 750 rooms slap bang in the heart of New Yorks Time Square where people must stay there for a handful nights each time. But decided it would be better to seek out somewhere where you did not feel you were putting everyone in the hotel out by just being there.I, therefore, was somewhat disappointed to find that I was going to have to stay there for 3 nights while on a business trip to New York in early December as the corporate rate we had was very compelling versus other options of $310 a night.I did find some changes since I last stayed there. The check-in staff seemed so much friendlier and this was the case over the course of the days I stayed there as I engaged with them to get my room changed. The beds and rooms seemed refreshed and brighter.I think I know why our corporate room was so good though as I was given a room with an inter-leading door to the next room on the 40th floor. It had a good view but I was kept awake late and woken up earlier by the people next door. They were not partying but just talking, watching TV and doing what you do. But you could hear everything. I asked to change rooms and even that room had an inter-leading door. This was a much nicer room as on the Club Floor with a stunning view across to the Hudson. It was (apparently) the bedroom part that had a lounge / sitting room next door that they told me that was not booked. Saying that on one night it was but it was not quite as noisy.I have found so many hotels in New York seem to have inter-leading doors and so now try and remember to ask when I check in as even if you have normal people it will be disrupting.The hotel was reluctant to change my room but persistence helped but even though I offered to upgrade and pay for a higher rate they struggled as this hotel although huge is always very full.The location is good if you want to be right there in the heart of Time Square but thinking about it more it all gets too much if you are there on business and often as hard to find decent places to eat as so many fast/ chain places to cater for the tourist trade of course. But if you want that then it is good.I think it is unlikely I will stay here again, but would tell people visiting New York, especially for the first time, to consider this if they can get a good deal. But at over $300 a night with a noisy room it is not a good deal!I have videos of the 2 rooms I stayed in:Room 3927 (The 2nd nicer room with the amazing view)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fyWLLTplTURoom 4025 (The 1st room)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiOdYXMtKSA"
345,1789,"Dec 5 2006 	Ok not what I expected for the price	I expected a little more at $400 a night, but I guess I was paying for location which was great. There was no cable for two days, which shouldn't matter since you are in New York. However, it is nice to watch some tv when you get back to the room to relax. We were not informed when we checked in that there was no cable nor were we offered alternatives when we spoke to the hotel about it, such as complimentary movies once the problem was fixed, a slight refund, coupons, etc. Ordering movies wasn't an option either because that system was down as well. There was also no safe in the room, morning paper, or bath supplies (e.g., shampoo) which is standard even at the cheapest hotels in New York. There was also no air conditioning. They turn it off in the winter, so beware if the temperatures are unseasonal warm like they were this past week. Will not stay here again."
346,1789,"Nov 8 2006 	Great place to stay in the Times Square area	My daughter and I stayed in room #3106 which had 2 full beds for 4 nights at the end of October. It was larger than I expected after reading about tiny rooms in New York City. We had what was called a &quot;harbor view&quot; which wasn't bad, but not as good as some of the pictures I've seen overlooking Broadway.The room was very clean and the linens were nice and comfortable, although the bed was a little softer than I'm used to. There was a desk/chair, comfortable easy chair, TV, 2 phones, radio-CD clock/alarm, a small closet with iron &amp; board, and a dresser with a safe and a few drawers. There was room on each side of the dresser to lay a suitcase without them being in the way. You could tell there was space for a minibar or small fridge, but I guess they removed them (we used the area to throw our dirty clothes!). A fridge would have come in handy to keep drinks and leftovers cold.The bathroom had a shower/tub combo, a hairdryer and small coffee pot. They provided a &quot;sleep kit&quot; which included linen spray, earplugs and sleep mask, as well as normal amenities such as soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. There was an ice and soda machine on each floor. Tea bags, hot chocolate packets and newspapers were complimentary at the lobby bar in the mornings. We didn't use room service or the restaurant, but I picked up a Starbucks coffee in the lobby a couple of times. We didn't use the health club or pool.Check-in and out was easy and the staff we had contact with were fine. On checkout day, we phoned the bellman to ask about storing our bags for the day and someone was at our door in about 2 minutes. Then when our car arrived to take us to the airport, he fetched our bags and returned in a flash.The location was great on the outskirts of the Times Square area, so the foot traffic in front of the hotel wasn't as bad as a couple of blocks downtown. There are two subway stations within a block which was very convenient so we walked and took the subway everywhere. Plenty of shops, delis and restaurants nearby, as well as many of the Broadway theaters.This is a nice tourist or buiness class hotel but not fancy or luxurious. I was able to use our corporate discount, and although the price was still outrageous, it was one of the lowest I could find for decent accomodations. I would stay there again, as long as the price is right."
347,1789,"Nov 3 2006 	Loved Crowne Plaza	Had a Super experience staying at Crowne Plaza! Stayed 2 nights. Loved the location (lots of restaurants nearby, close to subway, close to Junior's Cheesecake shop also!). Room was nicely sized ~ after reading about how small NY hotel rooms were ~ I was pleasantly surprised with the adequate size of the Double room we stayed in. Room was neat and clean (I'm a neat freak - gotta have a clean room!) Nice view looking down on Broadway St. and Times Square. Comfortable beds. I was very pleased with the whole experience at Crowne Plaza. Staff was friendly as well. Hope your stay is as good as ours!"
348,1789,"Oct 31 2006 	Great Hotel in NY	We returned from a fantastic time in NY on 26 October staying 5 nights at Crowne Plaza. Our family of 4 had two doubles on the 42nd floor and the amenities were excellent. Well furnished and clean, the beds were very comfortable and the towels and linen changed whenever you liked. The security in the Lobby was reassuring, and our only problem was as mentioned before we had 2 evenings when we could not access our room safe. Management soon got in for us though, giving us a explanation that after 48 hours unless a pin is changed then the safe 'locks up'. OK is you are not staying more than 2 nights. The gym and swimming pool were also good, swim caps must be worn in the pool and you have to be 18 for the gym, our 16 year old son was not so pleased. Check in was also smooth and we checked out by the room phone. We had room service a couple of times which was excellent food and prompt - even though a little pricey. We thought the location of the Hotel was brilliant and we would definitely return again."
349,1789,"Oct 31 2006 	loved the crowne plaza!	i stayed at the crowne plaza for three nights a few days ago and i loved it.we upgraded to the executive floor,$50 extra a night and for that you get a continental breakfast,snacks in the afternoon and free soft drinks/coffee all served in the executive lounge on the 46th floor.the room itself was a good size with a big,comfortable bed and we were on the 46th floor and the view was amazing.no complaints whatsoever about the room,nice big tv as well!what i liked about the hotel was the friendly atmosphere and the helpful staff,who were in the background if you needed their help.the bell hop guys were great and gave some great suggestions for places to eat!food and drinks in the hotel restaurant were nice,if a little expensive but it's what you'd expect for dining in the hotel.we did manage to have brunch at The View restaurant,the only revolving restaurant in New York at the top of the Marriott hotel,2 blocks down from the hotel.it cost $138 for two to have brunch,no extra drinks!very expenesive and whilst the novelty is there,the views are good but we could see the same section out of our hotel room!the crowne plaza is great for a central times square location,you really feel in the middle of the action and feel the buzz of the city that never sleeps."
350,1789,"Oct 25 2006 	Loved the Crowne Plaza	I stayed here for a conference and absolutely loved the location! You cannot beat the area, if you want to stay in Manhattan.The rooms are very large for a New York hotel and the bedding is very comfortable. The rooms are verry clean and all of the rooms have all of the necessay amenities. The high speed internet works great in the rooms, but there is no WIFI in the lobby area, which was kind of annoying, for a place that was holding such a large Tech. based conference. The food in the restaurant is good, and the service is good throughout the hotel."
351,1789,Oct 23 2006 	Great Staff!!	I stayed at the Crown Plaza last weekend for my birthday and booked through Priceline. The hotel is nice very secure and the room I was is large by New York standards. Room was very clean and housekeeping was able to clean the room while i was out later in the afternoon with a quck call to them. The front desk saw that is was my birthday and sent me up a few drinks and snacks prior to my dinner. All in all for the price I paid i was very happy with the hotel and service.
1,1791,"For the money you can find a better hotel with better service""	The location is great! But the service was awful! The rooms were large for New York standards."
2,1791,"Best Hotel and Best Location	The positive reviews of this hotel are for real. My take on the negative reviews is that there are some folks you can't please no matter what. I have stayed at this hotel twice and after having stayed at numerous other hotels in NYC, I have to say that this one of the best and is by far my favorite. It is really more like a small apartment in the heart of Times Square. I never had to spend the big bucks in a restaurant since we had a small kitchenette and brought in buffet food from a store nearby. As a very satisfied Hilton Hhonors Gold member, we got a free breakfast every morning, making this a terrific deal. This is now the ONLY hotel I will ever consider when visiting NYC."
3,1791,Nov 26 2009 	Perfect location-Perfect Hotel	Stayed here from Nov 19-23. Hotel is right in Times square and everything you want and need is right out side the doors. The lobby and check in is on the 3rd floor. Everybody we talked to was very friendly and help full if you had any questions. We stayed in room 3211 which was a suite with a pull out bed. My friend could not believe the size of the room as he was in NY earlier in the year and he said just the living room area was bigger than the room he had in the other hotel. If you are traveling in a party and don't want to be cramped then this is the place to stay. Outside noise was never a problem and never caused me to lose sleep. Elevators were fast and never had to wait that long to get one. Just watch the doors as they close fast. The only thing i found wrong was that the TV programs were not in High definition. My friend used the weight room every day and loved it. I went and looked at it and it had everything you needed for a good work out. This will be the only place i look to stay when i return to NYC.
4,1791,"Nov 25 2009 	Great Value	Every time I stay here I am amazed at the size of the room you get for the price and location. The Doubletree offers you a two room suite in the heart of Times Square for half the price of most other hotel's single rooms. The Hotel offers very few other amenities, but you are in Times Square, and 10 minute walk in any direction from literally hundreds of restaurants, bars and night clubs, so why do you need any hotel amenities other than a large, clean room? If you are taking the kids to the city, this is definitely the place to stay."
5,1791,"Nov 24 2009 	Great location clean comfy rooms	We stayed 4 nights at this hotel in November. Rooms were spacious and comfortably held us 3 girls and all our luggage plus what we bought while we were there! Check in was quick, easy and friendly considering we arrived at midnight. The girl gave us a choice of rooms and we went for one with a view of times square. We were only on the 9th floor so the view wasn't great and we also couldn't see the ground due to a ledge/balcony below our window but this didn't affect our stay in any way. The warm welcome cookies were a nice touch on arrival. The sofa bed in our room was not particularly comfortable but all 3 of us fitted easily into the one double bed which was extremely comfy. The room was kept very clean and had a nice sized bathroom, which you could access from the bedroom and living area. We also had 2 tvs, a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. The guys at the bell desk were very helpful and kept our cases for the day once we had checked out so thanks to Miguel and Jordan for their service. The hotel is in a great location so it is easy to reach everything from there. We found the nightlife in the surrounding area to be a bit too touristy - a bit like going out on a Saturday night in Leicester Sq or Picadilly when you live in London. We found the West Village area on our last day and wished we had found it sooner as it looked like a better night out could be had there with less posey people around. We booked the Sex and the City tour with Viator.com which is well worth doing if you are a fan of the show but try to do it early in your stay as the guide pointed out loads of sights and gave us special offer discounts which we were unable to visit or use as it was our last day there. Also, try to go to Carmine's - an italian restaurant which does really great food near to the hotel. They serve everything in big family portions so you just get the one starter and main dish and everyone shares. The 3 of us ate for around $60 and there was so much food left over it could have fed another 3 people. I'm not sure of the exact address but the concierge will be able to tell you at the hotel. Don't let the concierge tell you you won't get a table though. That's what they told us so we just got dressed up and went in. They asked us to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes when a table would be available so it wasn't a problem that we hadn't booked. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good location at a reasonable price. It's not luxury but it is clean, spacious and comfortable with good service, which is all you really need for a short break."
6,1791,"Nov 21 2009 	Great Staff Makes a Great Visit	Trip starts at the front door with Marco and Charlie M. When you get to Front Desk Danny , Michael, Carla, Demarris, and Jenny will take great care of you. Great security system in place"
7,1791,"Nov 19 2009 	An Unexpected Gem in Times Square	Walking around in the hustle and bustle of Times Square can be daunting, but as soon as you arrive in the third floor lobby of the Doubletree, it is serenely calm. It is the rooms, however, that really make this an exceptional value in New York. The suites are spacious and have been recently renovated. Mine had two double beds and a flat screen TV in the bedroom. There was a sizable, separate sitting room with sofa, table, chairs and TV. This room also had a wet bar, microwave oven and refrigerator. The sizable bathroom had two sinks and opened into either room. Comfy beds and bedding, too. Another plus -- if you arrive by train or bus to Penn Station, Grand Central Station, or the Port Authority terminal, the Doubletree is a manageable walk if you aren't carrying too much luggage. I would gladly stay here again."
8,1791,"Nov 18 2009 	SUPERLATIVE	We had booked another hotel for the weekend, but upon checking Hotwire.com the day before our planned New York trip we saw a 4-star Times Square all suite hotel posted for $148. It was obvious without much research that this was The Doubletree Guest Suites. Needless to say, we hastily cancelled our previous reservation and booked this immediately. We were impressed with the entire experience. We were greeted warmly by the front desk staff who put us into a 36th floor suite with spectacular cityscape views. The suite was spacious and beautiful with nice, well maintained furnichings, abundant lamps and warm lighting, elegant window treatments, and a great bed with luxury linens. The suite was pristinely kept with thoughtful touches at every turn. There was a huge, amenity laden bathroom with double vanity and entrances from both the bedroom and the living room. I had forgotten to pack shaving cream and a quick phone call had my request delivered within 5 minutes. There is a spacious wetbar with microwave, small refrigerator and coffee maker. We experienced absolutely no noise from the street or from adjacent hotel neigbors. It's readily apparent that the staff at this hotel is unifomly service and hospitality oriented. All public areas, including elevators, appear to be newly renovated. All in all, an outstanding hotel experience. Highly recommended!"
9,1791,"Nov 16 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised by the Doubletree	We just came back from a one night stay at the Doubletree. What can I say - it was a great stay! As others have reported, the rooms are large, two-roomed suites. We had a king on the 42nd floor with an amazing view of Time's Square all the way up to Central Park. Room was clean, comfortable and I could easily seeing spending a long weekend here. Loved having a mircro and mini fridge as well.My son had dinner at Ginger, the hotel's restaurant, and he enjoyed his steak. It wasn't a NY steakhouse but, the decor was nice and we didn't have to compete with noise, as we did at the other restaurants we dined at.Also really liked the reception/bar area. Found the hotel to have very good security in place.We'll definitely be back."
10,1791,"Nov 16 2009 	Magic.	Well what can i say that has not already been said, stunning view from the 34th Floor of Timeas Square, and i nice spacious suite that was perfect. The staff were fantastic especially Andrew at the ground reception, he took care of items i had left for friends to collect with great care and attention. Will be back that is for sure, go on treat yourself...stay here, you will not be dissapointed.One tip however IF you are calling home, use your mobile i was 62 in calls, and i can honeslty say did not make too many calls, seems a little overpriced to call international."
11,1791,"Nov 15 2009 	Absolutely amazing Hotel	Ive just come back from a 6 day break staying at this Hotel - as I went with two friend we chose this Hotel as it had a separate bedroom and a sofa bed in the front room - the rooms were very spacious and the King size bed was extremely comfortable, there were two flat screen tvs in the rooms. THe bathroom was very spacious and included a bath - also, we had a sink, fridge and coffee facilities in the lounge which came in really handy so two peopke could get ready to go out at one and not worry about waiting for the bathroom to use the mirror/bruch teeth etcWe stayed on the 21st floor and the view from our room was amazing, we looked out onto all the neon lights of Times Square - we all couldnt stop looking out and were hypnotised by them!Although it says you can have wireless broadband for a small cost, we had a free connection if you just wanted to check your emailsAll in all I cannot fault this Hotel - the location could not be beat - you walk out of the door and right onto the lights and madness of Broadway!"
12,1791,"Nov 10 2009 	fantastic locationcouldn't have asked for more	Really had a fantastic time in this hotel. It is so close to everything. Perfect for those girly shopping trips. The staff were excellent and so willing to help at any time. Daniel in reception was so good to us and Charlie and his colleague went to great lenghts to get us a hugh taxi to Newark airport in friday eveving rush hour traffic. Any time we called housekeeping they were so obliging. The only thing that was slightly off was the systenm with the channels on the tv. where they show all pay per view channels only but do not advise you that you can get music channels without having to pay for them. Cannot say another bad word about the hotel, Even though it was in times square there was no noise fron outside, the rooms were spacious and it was very reasonably priced cosidering location. I woiuld definitely stay there when I return to the big apple. Thanks to all the staff for the help, couldn't ask for more"
13,1791,"Nov 10 2009 	Beautiful hotel disappointing customer service	We reserved this hotel using Hotwire and requested two rooms that would accommodate 8 adults altogether. Two days before arrival, I called the hotel to confirm that we would have double beds in both rooms and was told that I could make such a request at check in... but not before. Naturally, upon check in we were told that all of the double bed rooms had been spoken for and our party of 8 would need to settle for two rooms that each had a king sized bed and a pull out couch. Not exactly what we were expecting (or paying for)... for 8 adults. To add insult to injury, the pull out beds in this hotel were barely passable as &quot;sleeping accommodations.&quot; The mattress was a mere 4 inches thick and fraught with squeaky springs that jabbed through the linens. Fast forward to our check on on Sunday when we requested to speak with the day manager (Carla Ortiz) who was very much &quot;on script&quot; and repeatedly informed us that we had intentionally selected our accommodations. When we explained the Hotwire reservation system to Ms. Ortiz (which doesn't include the option to select the number of beds, only to indicate the number of people in your party) she stated that we should have called ahead to request double beds. When that argument didn't work in her favor, she looked at her Hilton script and pointed her finger at Hotwire. Evidently, the Hilton hotel chain thinks that it is completely appropriate for their guests to sleep on a pull out bed... and thinks that giving out chocolate chip cookies is a replacement for actual customer service."
14,1791,"Nov 9 2009 	Great location! Excellent hotel staff especially Michael!	Excellent stay. The room was very spacious with a small living room, microwave and fridge. And clean and quiet, too. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially Michael. Each night, after returning from a long day of touring - Michael welcomed us with a warm smile and delicious cookie! The location is perfect.... right across the street from the half price tickets to broadway, close to Rockefeller Center, 15 minutes walking to Central Park. The Duck boat tour is exactlly 5 steps outside the door. Getting to the hotel is very easy. We took the express bus from Manhattan. It stops first at Grand Central and then Port Authority (42nd and Eighth). Get off at the second stop and walk to Times Square. The hotel is on the left side of the big Coke sign. Double Tree hotel in Times Square is at the top of my list for New York hotel recommendations. I look forward to staying here again.PS: There is a TGIF restaurant and electronic shop next door. Look up at the surveillance camera and call someone you know on the cell phone! www.earthcam.com/"
15,1791,"Nov 9 2009 	Excellent Hotel!	We were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Service was excellent, right from our arrival at the hotel to check-out. We have been to NYC quite often but this was our first time staying in Times Square. Location of the hotel was great and noise was minimal. The rooms were a little tired and may be in need of renovations but all in all, we were very happy with our decision to stay here."
16,1791,"Nov 8 2009 	Best value in NYC!	Four friends in one hotel room. This was the only place in town where we could all fit comfortably and stay within our budget. Having a fridge, coffee maker and sitting area in addition to two double beds was very convenient and the location was central to all of our sight-seeing. No amenities like one would expect in an all-suites hotel (like free-WiFi or continental breakfast) but the ability to cram 4 of us in a room for the same price as one room with a double bed in the W would have cost was totally worth it."
17,1791,"Nov 5 2009 	Every Stay is like Going Back Home!	I have stayed in dozens of hotels in New York City and, by far, this hotel offers the MAXIMUM in service. When they say they want to be a 10, THEY MEAN IT. I get points at the Hyatt and the Starwood Hotels (Westin) but their service doesn't come close to the Doubletree so I have chosen to stay here when I travel to the city for business. I feel comfortable, I feel secure, every request I have had has been granted - there is no reason to stay anywhere else! Marcos, their number one bell hop ALWAYS welcomes me back. Hanna, the sweet and beautiful hostess at the restaurant makes me feel as if I am the only customer in the place. I cannot say enough about these fine people. To be remembered and treated so kindly everytime I return is a RARE GEM for a large hotel."
18,1791,"Nov 1 2009 	Fabulous hotel location and holiday	I travelled to New York with my two teenage children in October half term, and chose The Doubletree Guestsuites because we wanted somewhere central. I wasn't disappointed one bit. The location couldn't have been better. We were right in the middle of Times Square where it really didn't sleep. However, the hotel rooms are all located on high floors and the heavy drapes helped to shield out noise and lights so it didn't affect our sleep when we finally decided to lay our heads down. What was also so great about the locations was that we were able to walk to see a show in the evening, walk to a range of restaurants includng TGI Fridays and Planet Hollywood, walk to Macy's, Fith Avenue and most of the good shopping areas without exhausting ourselves or getting blisters. The hotel was even in walking distance to the Empire State Building, Rockerfellers and Central Park. I would definitely advise people staying at the hotel to walk to your locations as much as possible, as you soon get to find your way around and you also see so much more. Besides, the traffic is so hectic, that often enough, it is probably quicker to walk than take a cab. The only times we needed to grab a a taxi was when it absolutely poured down and when we needed to get to the harbour to get a boat to take us on a tour. For those wanting to sightsee, I would recommend both Rockerfellers observation deck, as well as Empire State Building. We went to Rockerfellers in the daytime and Empire at night. It didn't close until 2am so we went at midnight. Brilliant choice - no queues and lit up New York at night was breath-taking. When we got out, we were offered a limosine ride back to the hotel for a mere $20. Needless to say, we accepted and it was great. I would also recommend the Circle Line cruise, which takes you down the Hudson, where you can see Manhattan Island, as well as the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge and many other main attractions. I bought a New York Pass which I used to get into most of the attractions. I haven't worked out yet if I managed to save money, but it probably saved us a little time from queueing. Although, in all honestly, we never experienced any major long queues anywhere. For those who love to shop, there is great variety. There are the top class stores but if you search, you will also find some reasonable priced discount stores. There is something for everyone but I wouldn't say you would be able to find anything cheaper than you can in England. I loved Macys most. The same goes for eating out. I didn't think it was particularly cheap but probably what you would expect to pay in most restaurants in London. Alcoholic drinks, I found were overpriced. I remember paying anything from $16-$22 for a double Baileys. And when I thought about buying a bottle in, I was horrified to find that the hotel could supply a bottle for $110. One of the great things about the hotel, other than the location, excellent room, facilities and service, was that we were allowed to bring in our own food and drink. This was particularly useful as my two teenagers were able to nip out late at night and bring in a MacDonalds from next door when they felt peckish. There were even mornings, when they fancied MacDonalds pancakes for breakfast. The room had both a fridge and a microwave, which meant if you do want to cater for yourself a little to save money, you can. It certainly helped me out with my two teenagers who constantly wanted to snack. All in all, we had a wonderful time. If you are thinking about going, do so. It really is a fantastic place to visit. Oh and if you go to Central Park, I would definitely recommend the little bicycle cab rides which will take you on an hour guided tour. We had a fantastic time, the guide was hilarious and showed us so many landmarks and could tell us about practically every location within the park which had been the scene for numerous films and TV shows. It cost about $80 for the guide but he really did earn it and it was great fun and Central Park in Autumn was truly stunning. The three of us loved New York. Both of my children want to move there. I wouldn't go that far but I am planning on going back in a couple of years, but I'd like to make my next visit at Christmas time."
19,1791,"Nov 1 2009 	Great hotel	Wow! This was my 7th trip to Times Square in 3 years. I'd never stayed at the Doubletree before, as we're members of another chain's rewards program. But, at the last minute I had the opportunity to travel to NYC and booked what was really the only reasonably priced room in the area.Upon arrival at 10 am, I was delighted to find a room available. When we got to the room, I was blown away by the view, overlooking Times Square, not to mention the size of the room, it was huge for NYC standards. I was a bit concerned since we were located by the elevators, but because of a hallway leading from our door to the bedroom, elevator noise was not a factor.I would definately recommend this hotel to friends, as well as stay there again of the opportunity presented itself."
20,1791,"Nov 1 2009 	Friendly and helpful staff spacious rooms great location	I have just returned from my second visit to New York City with 3 friends. I could highly recommend this hotel to other travellers. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by all the staff esp Daniel. Our suite was more than adequate with a fridge, microwave etc etc. The cleaning and house keeping staff were very helpful and nice. Room was spotless when we arrived and it was serviced every day.The only criticism that I have is that when you switch on the tv, the entertainment package comes on automatically which you have to pay for if you use-we weren't aware of that and ended up buying a music package that we didn't want.I will def return to this hotel and would highly recommend it to fellow travellers.PS The welcome cookies were delicious- thanks Daniel :-)"
21,1791,"Oct 31 2009	Best location in the heart of NY	This was my first time in NY. I researched online for over a month before I decided to stay at the Doubletree in Times Square. I don't regret it. Although pricey you just can't beat the location. The double decker red tour bus was right across the street from the hotel. Also, there is a fairly new Walgreens along with a Metro station within easy walking distance. The location is excellent. The room was clean and service was great. I would recommend the suite style room for any family. We stayed in a suite with sofa-bed and two double beds in a separate room. It was a very comfortable room, and as I understand roomy but by NY standards."
22,1791,"Oct 30 2009 	Recommended family hotel in the best location	Clean, safe and excellent location. I'd recommend Doubletree for families, since the rooms are big, have a fridge and the location is so good. Whenever travelling with family we return here."
23,1791,"Oct 28 2009 	Truly outstanding - but avoid the concierge!!!	The hotel was excellent in virtually every way - but I'd advise anyone to give the concierge a miss.The rooms are huge by NY standards, and ours was pretty much silent (we were on a low floor facing Times Square which I would guess would be the noisiest part of the hotel).The location is perfect if you want the bustle of the square, but it is pretty vibrant around the hotel, particularly late at night so think about this.The employees of the hotel are truly outstanding. We were asked &quot;is there anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable?&quot;, on a number of occasions. There wasn't. The breakfast buffet is comprehensive and we skipped lunch most days - the team in the restaurant were really friendly and I have to single out Steve, who was on the egg stand one morning. My wife ordered waffles, and Steve was talking her into having two. I mentioned that it was her birthday - and Steve's face immediately lit up and wished her a happy birthday. He then dashed off through a door to reappear moments later clutching a bag with a couple of tins of Doubletree cookies - and told my wife that the entire team at the hotel wished her a happy birthday. A truly lovely gesture from an outstanding ambassador for the hotel.The bell-hop team were excellent as well (we do tend to leave NY with more luggage than we arrive with)...Now the bad bit - the hotel appears to have &quot;outsourced&quot; its concierge to a third party company called Continental Guest Services whose team was very poor. Firstly, the Mexican restaurant which they &quot;booked&quot; for us didn't have a table when we arrived, and then told us that they didn't in fact accept reservations. We were offered the chance to wait for a table but declined.On the day of our departure, we booked a car to Newark airport - and paid $114. While one of the team arranged this, we couldn't help but overhear a female member of the team, telling a more junior member of the team how to sell theatre tickets to unsuspecting guests. The &quot;tips of the trade&quot; made me think that I would never, ever buy tickets from a hotel concierge again, and immediately made me think we'd been ripped off.One of my buddies told me that this was way over the odds, and arranged an alternative at 1/3 less than this. The booking confirmation arranged by the hotel concierge stated that the booking could be cancelled with more than two hours' notice but team initially claimed that all sales were final and non-refundable. After some prompting from me, and a debate with the woman mentioned above, they agreed to refund my money.So...., all in all an excellent hotel. Great rooms and brilliant staff who all want to &quot;go the extra mile&quot;. But my tip would be to avoid the concierge like the plague, and my tip for the hotel management would be get rid of the outsourced concierge company and employ people more in tune with the rest of their staff."
24,1791,Oct 26 2009 	ALL LEVELS OF SERVICE EXCEPTIONAL	From our arrival to our check out we received exceptional service from everyone at Doubletree. Freindly and accomodating staff. Clean and comfortable room with a beautiful view. The cookies were a delicious treat. We had a wonderful 7 day vacation in the heart of New York!
25,1791,"Oct 26 2009 	Check-in was great concierge desk was not very pleasant	Daniel provided us with wonderful check in service which was a great way to introduce and welcome us to NYC. However, the concierge desk was a very unplesant experience. Wrong directions, addresses, and a general lack of knowledge the city. Their main focus is selling bus tours."
26,1791,"Oct 26 2009 	WOW - This hotel is awesome!!!	I am a seasoned business traveler with very high expectations. THe only reason I booked the doubletree was because it was the only mid-town hotel I could find that offered true Suites (a total closed off bedroom from the living area). When I booked I noticed it was rated as a 3 1/2 star hotel, so my expectations were not very high. What a great surprise, I was driving into the city and they gave me perfect driving instructions, I pulled up handed over my keys and the car was taking by the valet ($35 per night if you pick up the car from the garage at the end of your trip) and the baggage was handled by the Bell Hop. The lobby is very nice and the Front desk staff amazing (Daniel - who loves Spain BTW) check us in he was professional freindly funny and super accomondating to our needs. I think for business or pleasure this is an awesome spot. I would recomend a higher floor to be removed from the Times Squre buzz."
27,1791,"Oct 26 2009 	Daniel was AWESOME!	Daniel at the front desk was extremely helpful with &quot;concierge&quot; type advice - he helped us get our priority tickets to visit the Empire State Building , recommended shows, touristy activities, and wonderful restaurants. Employees like Daniel are invaluable to me as an infrequent traveler, and he was especially wonderful. Thank you, Doubletree and Daniel, for making our trip even more wonderful and efficient!"
28,1791,"Oct 25 2009 	Simply outstanding!	My family and I (2 adults &amp; 2 boys 11 and 7) stayed at the Doubletree in October. We arrived by taxi from the airport (which was so efficient and organised) and were thrilled when we pulled up right in the middle of Times Square. Check in was speedy and we were delighted with the warm cookies we received. Our room was on the 14th floor and we had a view to Times Square. The room was clean, comfortable and had all the ammenties that a family of 4 required for a comfortable stay including a small refrigerator and a microwave. It was a shame that wifi was not included, however we didn't really have time to sit at the computer anyway.The location of the hotel is brilliant. Right on the corner of 7th and 47th streets with the TKTS booth outside and a subway station next door. The hop on/off bus tours start right across the street as well. Times Square is an area where you feel completely safe at all hours of the day and night. There is a security check at the elevators to further ensure your safety as well. While there are some great restaurant in Times Square I would recommend not eating there as it can be quite expensive ($90 for breakfast was a shock!). However, Rays pizza on 48th was amazing! The kids liked the hot dog vendours and just like any other city it is always best to eat where the locals eat. New York is an amazing city and when my husband and I (yes no kids next time) return in 2010 we will definitely stay here again."
29,1791,Oct 24 2009 	Great hotel-near everything	This hotel is right on Times Square. The Broadway discount center is right across the street. Subway and West Side Story theater are both next door. Breakfast buffet was great! Lights of Times Square can be seen out the window. Room very clean and housekeeping very friendly. Walking distance to Broadway theaters and many good restaurants.
30,1791,"Oct 23 2009	Doubletree Guest Suites is the best Hotel in Times Square	As a long time Hilton Honors member (Diamond VIP), this hotel is awesome. Since I am a Diamond VIP, I was checked into my room by the doorman on the first floor, which meant I did not have to stand in a line. My suite was on the 29th floor and had commanding views of all the neon that Times Square is world famous for. Even though there is much hustle and bustle with noise on the street, I could not here anything in the suite. It is great to be able to stretch out with this much space. The breakfast buffet is one of the best that I have encountered. I found employees in the hotel to be very customer-service oriented. Location is central to all of New York's great tourist attractions. I would defintely stay at this hotel again."
31,1791,"Oct 23 2009 	Great midtown location. A bit expensive.	We stayed Oct 16-19 at the Doubletree Times Square. The woman at check-in was very accommodating and gave us a King suite on the 31st floor. Warm cookies for all at check-in. Even though you are in the center of all the NYC action, the lobby is on floor 3, away from the noise and traffic of Times Square.The room was clean, spacious (for NYC) and large windows gave our kids a perfect view overlooking M&amp;M World to the north. Elevators were fast and we never had to wait long for one, no matter what time of day. The location is very convenient to most theaters and Rockefeller Center.Overall I give it high marks, but we will probably look for something less expensive next time. We spent most of our time exploring the city, and would be fine with staying in a hotel with less amenities in order to save some money."
32,1791,"Oct 22 2009 	Priceless views of Times Square--terrific tourist hotel	I just returned from NYC for a business trip and stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan and the Doubletree Suites. I was in 2901, which is a corner King Suite with commanding views of Times Square (exactly where the ball comes down). All 01 rooms, i.e. 2701, 2801,2901, etc are CORNER suites with a view directly south from the living room of where the ball drops each New Year's Eve. Being a corner you have another view of the north side of Time Square from the other corner of the living room as well as from the bedroom. The views really were amazing and are MUCH nicer than anything I've had (even very high end suites at either the Westin, the Marriott Marquis or the W--all in the same neighborhood). The view is really off the hook and if a view is important to you, I would hightly recommend the Doubletree.The location is very busy as it is directly in Times Square but the suite was fairly spacious. The suite was clean there was a 42 inch LG LCD in the living room but there was an old tube style TV in the bedroom--sort of an odd combination in my view.Checkin is a breeze if you are a Hilton Diamond guest as they literally handed me my key in the lower lobby. This VIP checkin and treatment is only for Hilton Diamond members but if you are this is a real nice benefit. I did not deal with the &quot;regular&quot; front desk so can't comment on anything there.This hotel is not nearly as hip or trendy as the W across the street but it is very solid and a good value--again with astonishing views of Time Square. The area is VERY busy (24 hours per day) but the windows provide a high level of sound insulation and the blinds are nearly black out for sleeping.If you want to stay in Times Square and want a little more room than the other offerings I would highly recommend the Doubletree."
33,1791,"Oct 21 2009 	Wonderful location spacious suites but annoying lapses in quality	We've stayed at this hotel on average twice per year since before it became a Doubletree Guest Suites; originally, it was an Embassy Suites hotel. The primary attractions are its location and that all rooms are suites with two televisions, a large bathroom, and a modified wet bar that includes a fridge and microwave. (If one of us wants to nap, for example, it's possible to do so without being disturbed.) There is plenty of storage room, work space, and outlets to recharge computer, camera, and iPod batteries, etc. Despite a supposed upgrading of the rooms, the furniture and decor look dated and a bit worn. There are new HD flat panel televisions in the living rooms, but the signal is standard definition, widened to fit the 16:9 ratio screen, which makes everything rather distorted-looking. The in-room wi-fi was frustratingly slow this most recent visit, and the hotel was having intermittent Internet connection problems during our stay, something we never experienced during previous visits. The redecoration of the main lobby is not to our liking -- we think it looks hideous -- and a bar with flat screens has been installed in it, but since that's not where we sleep, we were willing to overlook this lapse of taste. One thing we found annoying is that guests would put their room service trays outside on the floor of the hallway, and they would sit there literally for hours, often overnight, before being retrieved by housekeeping. We'll most likely continue to stay here, but we're open to finding another hotel that offers similar amenities without slipping in quality."
34,1791,"Oct 20 2009 	Great Hotel Great location	Before i booked this hotel, i read countless reviews on trip advisor. This was the reason i chose this one. I can't fault the hotel in anyway whatsover!Location - amazing! Right in the centre of times square, very close to 5th av, the rockerfeller centre and much more! This is a busy location and you will get plenty of sirens from the cops throughout the night - this is why we were here , for the hustle and bustle! saying that though - you will get plenty of sleep as its well soundproofed. we were on floor 20.check in/check out - very quick - nice cookies, staff always helpful. ( one was a bit grumpy but i can live wiith that)lifts - great - never had to wait and they are very fastwe didn't try the restaurant but the bar is well overpriced but good service.rooms - very very clean, spacious and well laid out. room service is overpriced and don't use the phone. $25 for a 5 minute call home!!!!!!Security staff very friendly and helpful.all in all, i have never had such a trouble free stay in any hotel , anywhere! we chose a king suite with times square view - well worth it."
35,1791,"Oct 17 2009 	Start spreading the news...	Doubletree on Broadway...finally, after all of the renovations, the lobby and restaurant are open for prime time business. Located in the heart of Broadway, the Doubletree is a great place to stay for business or fun! Hilton standards (especially the Doubletree warm cookies) makes it a place to stay, albeit a bit pricey. The gym is &quot;cozy,&quot; but has free weights (dumbells), machine, and cardio equipment - makes it a good place to burn off the calories from eating all of the cuisine available in NYC. IF fortunate enough to have a room adjacent to Broadway, the heavy curtains ensure that the lights of Broadway do not keep you up at night. Other than the occasional siren, street noise is minimal (if on higher floors). The restaurant is also a bit &quot;cozy&quot; for the size of the property, but the breakfast buffet is great!Be aware that when you arrive at the property, enter the hotel where security will ask if you are checking in (why else would I be walking with my suitcase right?). Enter the lobby and walk to the elevator where you enter the real lobby to check in and recieve your warm chocolate chip cookie! Staff is great and as all realtor say, its all about three things, &quot;location, location, location.&quot;"
36,1791,"Oct 16 2009 	Large room in Theater District	We used Hilton Honors points to stay free in a king suite. We typically stay at Bryant Park but free is free. The time square location of this property is convenient to the Theater District. Just walk out of the door and 1/2 price Tickets booth is in front of you. Now with the pedistrian areas on times square you can walk around and take photos with greater ease. The rooms are typical Doubletree suite rooms nothing special. We were traveling alone and obviously had adequate space. Small families could easily stay in these rooms without to much trouble. The tile on the shower wall was cracked in several locations and one of the light switches was barely hanging on the wall. Internet access was 12.95 for 24hrs. Which is bad but not terrible; although should be free. Checkin was easy and they give you warm cookies. The doorman is another issue. He was standing there in his nice uniform looking professional but that is what he did...stood there. Everyone arriving and leaving the hotel had to deal with their luggage and hailing a cab on their own. If you are going to have a doorman and there were actually two of them, have them interact with the guest and offer great customer service. They are your first contact that individuals have with the property. To bad these guys are just wearing a costume."
37,1791,Oct 15 2009 	Our service upon arrival from Daniel was friendly inviting -- a nice start to our stay!	Clean room and comfortable bed!!! Front door service was quick and friendly -- I had a taxi in no time and they held the door and placed my luggage in the taxi for me. Staff was helpful in finding the perfect restaurant and location for our dinner.
38,1791,"Oct 14 2009 	If we could have only stayed longer!!! October is a great time to stay at DGS in Times Square.	My mom and I celebrated our birthdays in Times Square and had a wonderful experience. We enjoyed two plays, good food, all the surrounding 'not to miss' sites, shopping, etc...all within walking distance to the DSG hotel. There is so much transportation to pick from, you are best to not rent a car as it costs quite a lot of money to park in garages. The subways were definitely an adventure and thank goodness for all the nice people who are so kind to help you figure out which one to take and what direction. The taxis are constantly pouncing on their horns, just like in the movies! I would not really recommend Times Square for small children....there is quite a bit of hustle-bustle there. One of our highlights was Michael who greeted us when we arrived the first night all tuckered out and then each following night when we came back from our daily excursions. He always gave us a wave and a big smile and asked how our day went. Michael answered all our questions and gave us tips when we told him our plans for the next outing. He laughed when we told him we took the rickshaw to the Empire State Building and back instead of riding the taxi (Mom is 80!) Michael even yelled out Happy Birthday to us! He went above and beyond every day. DGS is very fortunate to have such a gentleman serving the public. Add to this, our room was clean and fresh every day. The maids were very friendly and pleasant with us in the hallways. The gentleman at the street level was also kind. He would ask for room ID key cards to ensure only guests were entering the hotel which made us feel safe. I don't want to forget about the concierge desk which was ready with answers, maps, offers to make ticket or restaurant arrangement, etc. All in all, there is not one bad thing to say. We had a very enjoyable time in Times Square. Thank you again Michael for your smile and your charming ways."
39,1791,"Oct 14 2009 	Very nice accomodations and location still steep price though...	We were in the City just for one night to see two Broadway plays. We chose this hotel because it's smack-dab in the middle of Times Square and easy to walk right to both theatres. This was our first time staying at Doubletree (Hilton) Suites, and we were pleasantly surprised. A very nice/sophisticated hotel lobby, pleasant people at the desk and a nice big (for NYC) room, even though it looks kinda &quot;Times Square&quot; grimey from outside. Don't let the appearance deter you. The rooms appeared to be newly updated, they we very clean, and comfortable - and free WiFi. Will likely stay here again!"
40,1791,"Oct 13 2009 	Great Experience!	You know what they say about LOCATION....This is a fantastic starting point to see all the sights of NYC. The staff here excels at service and are very knowledgeable. Everyone was friendly from the doormen to housekeeping and the tasty warm cookies at registration were an added bonus! The suite is spacious, clean and my parents loved the luxurious king mattress. I even found the pull out sofa to be comfortable. Subway stations are nearby and again, the staff was tops. I will stay here again in the future."
41,1791,"Oct 12 2009 	Can't imagine staying anywhere else....	I just returned from my 3rd NYC trip. Each time we stayed at DoubleTree Guest Suites. The first time was by chance - the next 2 times by choice. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable, and, of course, the location is great. However, the best part about the DoubleTree is the excellent treatment we receive each time by the entire staff. EVERYONE from lobby security, to desk staff, to concierge, to housekeeping, to restaurant staff.....combined to make our visit in NYC pleasant.  Specifically, Daniel at the desk was so helpful when helping us arrange for boarding passes. The breakfast hostess on Oct. 9th, 10th, 11th (I don't recall her name) was very kind in clearing up a discrepancy in our breakfast package. The waitstaff was attentive and accomodating. The concierge staff was so patient and helpful with each and every request. Every employee that we passed in the hallway or elevator greeted us with friendliness and respect. Requests we made for extra blankets and missing wash cloths were filled in a timely manner. I typically find that the spirit of good service is alive and well in NYC. However, the DoubleTree sets the standard. The person(s) responsible for service training here deserve a raise! This may sound corny, but the level of customer service received here is inspiring. Although there are other, less expensive places to stay in Times Square, it is a great value."
42,1791,"Oct 12 2009 	The Perfect Hotel for New York City!	This amazing hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square! With great decor, amazing rooms, and spectacular views... this is the only hotel I will stay in when I visit NYC! I love the staff! Great staff who are willing to assist guests who are new to NYC! AMAZING FITNESS CENTER!"
43,1791,"Oct 9 2009 	Girls weekend best place to stay	As a first time visitor this is a perfect hotel easy walk (across the street) from the grayline bus tour, the Lion King (2 blocks), and Carmines (&lt; block from Lion King). Everything was right there. We even had a craving for Chinese at 1100pm and the fromt desk directed us to a nice litte Chinese Restaurant Pearls a block away. With room having fridge and microwave we got water at market a few blocks away and carried our own water. One thing I found out later to see Ground Zero in 2009 Sept you need to go up into the 3rd floor of McDonalds to see the actual site due to the curtains around the sites. Hotel was great location to be near all the Broadway shows and have room for 4 to stay in 1 room and have a great view! Just get the king premium view to get a good view. You can request high floors but to actually get one you need to get the premium view when you book accoording to several others in the elevators. There were no other hotels as close to time square/on time square. We could see the ball from our room. But could not hear any noise while in our rooms. It was perfect not a thing I would have asked to be changed."
44,1791,"Oct 8 2009 	Ahhhh-tum in NYC	This must be the most perfect time to visit NYC; not too hot, not too cool, bright clear sunny skies and the location of the Doubletree was perfect for our brief 2 day visit. We were able to &quot;bar hop&quot; through Central Park, enjoyed a wonderful &quot;Conversation&quot; at MoMA, and did a really touristy thing by taking the Duck Tour (which conveniently picks up practically outside the front door of the hotel). If Broadway shows are on your &quot;gotta do's&quot;, then you are within walking distance of a dozen of the best NY has to offer. Restaurants! Wine Bars! Shopping! All I can say is Go! Enjoy!"
45,1791,"Oct 8 2009 	Fantastic stay! Love the Doubletree Times Square	I've stayed in this hotel twice in the past year and I have absolutely loved it each time. First of all, the location is fantastic - right in the middle of Times Square! The rooms are large and spacious, especially for NYC standards. Everything was clean and lovely. The views from the room are also amazing. I will continue to stay at the Doubletree Times Square when I visit NYC. I highly recommend this hotel!"
46,1791,Oct 8 2009 	Great hotel Great location	I have been to NYC alot.......and have stayed at various hotels - this was by far the BEST. People were great. Location was right in the middle of Times Square and we had a room that overlooked Times Square.......I couldn't of asked for a better expereience.
47,1791,"Oct 8 2009 	In the heart of the action!	You are in the heart of the Broadway district at this hotel. Right across the street from the discount theater tickets booth. We didn't need to take a cab anywhere; we felt we were close enough to walk to all our destinations. The food is pretty expensive nearby, but we did find a diner that locals got to about 6 blocks away. We had a room up high; the view was great. Be aware, the bright lights are lit all night long and shine in to the room...the price you pay for a great view. The room was clean and comfortable. We didn't eat the hotel but greatly enjoyed the warm chocolate chip cookies available anytime of the day. We would definately return to this hotel on future visits."
48,1791,"Oct 8 2009 	Smack dab in the middle of the action yet above it all.	My boyfriend and I went on a birthday trip to NYC this past August. He'd never been to New York, and I had wanted to show him the frenzy and lights and endlessly peopled spectacle of TImes Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is on the corner of 47th St. &amp; where Broadway and 6th Ave split, about a half a block away form where the ball drops on New Year's, so it was a perfect fit for the location, plus I got a HELL of a deal on Priceline for the hotel and round trip air, so that made the decision super easy. The first thing I want to point out is that the hotel entrance to the street level &quot;1st lobby&quot; is right next to a subway station, so anytime we were coming from uptown we'd just hop out and be right at the entrance to the hotel, which was so nice after long days of exploring the Met, walking around Central Park, etc. The second thing I want to make very clear is that we were treated so well by all of the staff that it really should've been the first thing I said. The Concierge was fantastic, the staff at the check in/out counter were all friendly and helpful, and the room was kept beautifully. It was a beautiful place to come back to at night or take a break from the CRUSHING heat and humidity of NYC in late August (I will never do that again, but it was fun...just sweaty, somewhat irritable fun at times). The AC was pumping, the bed was soft and warm, and there was a tv in the bedroom as well as the livingroom area. Fridge and microwave, the safe worked, plenty of closet &amp; drawer space, and the bathroom was really nice with ample room for two people getting ready together. I never felt crowded. Well, except for when we left the hotel, hahaha...the view from our windows was gorgeous and we could see all the way to Central Park through this small swath of clear space between sky scrapers. I want to say we were on the 32nd floor, and only heard the street if we opened the windows. Which, by the way, is a really nice feature that many hotels seem to neglect these days: windows that open.Also, the warm cookie at check in was a nice touch :) Oh, and the free internet in the &quot;2nd lobby&quot; (you have to get int hrough the street level and then take an elevator to the check-in lobby on the 3rd floor) was also helpful...I was kinda bummed that the daily rate for using internet in your room was like $12, but MEH, we'd just go to the lobby."
49,1791,"Oct 8 2009 	Broadway Lights and Good Times	Myself, Mother, Sister and 10 year old Daughter stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. Never visiting the BIG city I only prepared for this trip by view of the trip boards and friends reviews. I booked with Double Tree based on the location as I wanted to take in the New York lights and hustle and bustle ( this is the hotel for that) as well as the suite accomodations and rate. All of these preferences were provided. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 which was around check out time, though was greeted by the doorman and directed to check in our luggage and asked to check back within the next two hours which we did and was taken to our room and given a brief review of room accomodation and close by eateries and conveniences. Hotel staff was always accomodating. The room was very clean and toiletries were replenished every day! The room was very quiet, even though it looked out on Broadway. I cannot wait to go back!!! The only downside was that the front lounge area was small which did not leave any enviroment for lounging which we looked for on two nights as we did have some rainy evenings, as well as it did not have a pool."
50,1791,"Oct 7 2009 	Doubletree is Great Hotel!	This is my third stay at the Doubletree and I highly recommend it if you are looking for proximity to Times Square, the theatre district, subways, and a large, quiet space to get away from it all. We stayed at Doubletree Times Square from 9/26 - 10/4. Room was #3506, was fresh, appeared to be recently updated and had two extremely comfortable doubles and a pull out couch. Checked in early. Room was quiet and housekeeping service excellent. Refrigerator and microwave excellent addition. Bathroom was spacious and had double sinks. Concierge and security were friendly and helpful. Lack of free internet and absence of flat screen in bedroom was noticed but not missed as we spent so little time in the room. Also, as Hilton Honors member, we were given free buffet breakfast, which I cannot imagine paying $24.95 per person for, especially since the wait staff could best be described as surly and inattentive. Otherwise, the buffet included chef prepared omelets, french toast, and waffles as well as excellent variety of other breakfast items and was absolutely a great way to start the morning."
51,1791,Oct 6 2009 	Wonderful location and hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of September. The rooms are lovely and big and its great having a seperate lounge area. We were on the 21st floor and it was incredibly quiet even though it was right on Times Square. We managed to check in early which was handy. The staff were very helpful and the welcome cookie was delicious. Have stayed in quite a few hotels in NY but this was certainly in the best location and had the biggest space. Would not hesitate to stay there again.
52,1791,"Oct 5 2009 	Loved location of hotel	I travelled with two sisters &amp; two nieces for a long weekend for my first visit to the Big Apple. After being out in the hustle &amp; bustle of Times Square the hotel is an oasis of calm &amp; quiet. The staff are all very friendly &amp; accomodating. Loved the cookies at check-in &amp; the delicious martinis in lobby bar. Our room was on 41st floor offering a great view of the M&amp;M billboard etc. The rooms are definitely a good size for females getting ready for theatre, shopping etc. We had no problem getting taxis whenever we required them. I would stay at hotel on a return visit."
53,1791,"Oct 3 2009 	Huge rooms in the heart of the City	Spent one night here for a quick girl's getaway. Couldn't beat the location -- directly across the street from the TKTS booth, which we definitely utilized. Right in the middle of Times Square so really convenient to Theaters &amp; restaurants. We stayed on 29th floor &amp; had a partial view of Times Square. The rooms were HUGE by NYC standards so well worth the price for both space &amp; location. Very clean &amp; modern accommodations. I would definitely stay here again."
54,1791,"Oct 1 2009 	Amazing Hotel Experience	I traveled w/six friends to celebrate our 40th birthdays and when researching where to stay, I relied heavily on the reviews here to make my decision. I was not disappointed! We had two suites for the 7 of us and had some minor problems w/ one of the rooms (ie the refrigerator did not work) but the problems were fixed in a timely manner. At check in we asked for adjoining rooms w/double beds (we had king size beds next door to each other) and were able to change rooms 2 days into our trip. Every request we had was promply addressed. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful! (Diana is a wonderful asset - she deserves a raise for helping me as much as she did!!!) We did not use the consierge or eat at the restaurant so I can't comment about them, but the location of this hotel is AWESOME! Theaters and so many other attractions are so closeby that we were able to drop off packages on our way to the next attraction. TImes Square is a hoot with lots of shops. A subway stop is just steps from the front door and the bus stops close to the door or right across the street depending on direction. Broadway is closed across from the hotel which decreases car traffic however the area outside the front door can become congested w/foot traffic...I loved it but it's not for everyone. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable (king size more so than the double). I'm trying hard to find something negative to say and the only thing I can say is I wish the internet would have been free in the suites (there are two places in the hotel to get free access though) and free coffee in the lobby also would have been nice...but that's it folks...everything else is A+. Oh and did I mention how wonderful Diana is at the front desk?? Will definitely stay here again!"
55,1791,"Sep 29 2009 	Couldn't ask for more	My friend and I spent 4 nights at this hotel for a fashion week girls trip and were completely satisfied. Pros:Super Comfy BedsGreat Service (concierge, front desk, maid service)Fantastic Location (right near the subway station and in Times Square)Very Clean and New Looking RoomsQuiet (we were on the 37th floor)Beautiful LobbyExcellent Security (they checked for our room key each night)Cons:Location is congested, but very centralized"
56,1791,"Sep 28 2009 	Would love to go back!	Excellent hotel, large room with nice new furnishings, wonderful location for seeing the sights, other guests all very friendly, great martinis in lobby bar! Concierge was very helpful as was reception staff."
57,1791,"Sep 26 2009 	Expensive smart Central Clean super-efficient	We stayed in this very clean, super efficient hotel. We had a premium king on the 42nd floor and there was a sofabed in the luvingroom which was very comfortAble. Security aS good, location was great. Drawbacks: Super Douper expensive even booking 10 months in advance."
58,1791,"Sep 24 2009 	best service at double tree metropolitan on lexington avenue	Hi, I just want to say that the the double tree hotel on lexington ave and 51st was great. They treated us great. the service was just on point. Their staff, bell boys, receptionists were very kind and helpful. even the cleaning ladies were friendly and accomodating. When i asked for extra towels they supplied them right away. I def want to recommend this hotel for any future travelers. Their service made our trip more enjoyable."
59,1791,"Sep 21 2009 	Good staff great location	Stayed here while attending the USOpen. Clean and comfortable accommodations with friendly staff. Can't beat the location in the center of Times Square, close to everything.Looked online for tickets to Wicked for Friday night, best seats were so-so at $130 a piece. We saw the hotel Concierge and she used a broker and got us great seats for the same show for just $50 more."
60,1791,"Sep 21 2009 	Terrific Large Room!	I stayed at this hotel with my wife, mother-in-law, and two children - ages 1 &amp; 3. The rooms have been renovated within the last year, and ours was fantastic!...very large for a New York hotel. All of the furnishings and surfaces seemed practically new. The beds were great, and the fold-out sofa bed was even okay. It's the perfect size for a family of 4 or more. The bedroom is a separate room that can be closed off from the rest of the room, and the best part is the bathroom - which had a large double sink, and 2 doors - one connected to the bedroom, and one connected to the living room. Plus there is a 3rd sink in the wetbar! It's a great setup! The staff and service was great. The business center still needs updating. The location is great for tourist activities - there's a subway access point almost directly outside the front door. The TKTS booth is directly across the street. My only complaint about the location is that it's on a very crowded corner in Times Square. So coming and going often involves navigating through a dense crowd of people. If you need a large room in New York, this is a great choice!"
61,1791,"Sep 16 2009 	Wonderful hotel perfect location!	Stayed here for five nights. As first time New York visitors, we were thrilled with the location. We were able to walk most anywhere, or to take the subway which was right at the corner! The suites were perfect for a five night stay, nice to have some extra room! The hotel was very clean, felt very safe,and the staff was extremely helpful with everything. Our room was on 39th floor with a city view. Amazing!"
62,1791,"Sep 16 2009 	Location and space can't be beat	I concur with the other reviews - good room size, comfortable bed and pillow, and dark curtains that blacked out the neon signs. The pull out couch had very dirty cushions, but the bed portion was fine. The bathroom was fine, not super clean, but sufficient. Good AC. The brunch was nice but expensive."
63,1791,"Sep 14 2009 	Great hotel in NYC	Just came back from this years US Open, this is our third year staying at the Times Square Doubletree hotel.THe location can't be beat for convenience, all of the staff were very friendly and helpfull, the rooms are spacious and very clean, prices are surprisingly reasonable for NYC and such a great location.Overall would highly recommend this hotel and we will stay again next year"
64,1791,"Sep 11 2009 	Again a great stay	This was our second stay at the Doubletree. I was in NYC on business and my two teenage daughters went along (the hotel is a great base for the kids to explore the city from, however I wouldn't recommend turning teenage girls loose in Times Square but mine are well acquainted with the city). The room, the staff, the check in, all were perfect. We always feel safe there, the staff in the first floor lobby is discreet however they are very observant of people coming and going. The location, of course, is perfect. A subway station is literally 20 steps from the front door.I left positive comments on the survey card upon check out, and the manager called me the following week to thank me. I have never had that happen at any hotel previously! I recommend this hotel highly and will certainly return again."
65,1791,"Sep 10 2009 	Excellent hotel the staff is incredible	This was the second time I stayed at this hotel while in New York and it was great again. The rooms are all nice sized and recently decorated. The hotel is exceptionally clean. It is right in the middle of mid-town so you are close to everything. If you are going to be going to broadway shows you can walk from the hotel. Everyone there is so nice. My friend got really sick and needed to go to the hospital. I called the front desk, they got a cab for us, came up to the room to escort us down, told the cab where to go. They were great. They called the room several times to check on her. I really appreciated their concern and help."
66,1791,"Sep 9 2009 	Great room awkward entrance at night	We stayed for 2 nights and had a great time here. Having two rooms helps when traveling with infants - we put the baby and pack and play in the bedroom at night, and hung out in the family room. The room was clean, check in was easy, and all was good. We stayed in Times Square because a conference was nearby. There lot a lot of people on the sidewalks outside, with the hotel across from the Tixs Center. One strange thing was that the lobby was on the 3rd floor, that you take elevators to get to. I came in later at night, and the secuity people almost did not let me in because my name was not on the reservation. Also, could have used more towels, though the help was awesome in taking a big bag of birthday party trash."
67,1791,Sep 9 2009 	A Place to recommend for any New York visit	Stayed in the Doubletree at Times Square for 6 nights with as a family with 2 teenage sons in August 2009. We arrived early but were given a room straight away. We had a suite with a king size bed and a sofa bed for the boys. This provided us with excellent accommadation for any family staying in NYC. The location is in a prime postion in Time Square. I have read previous reviews and have to agree that the sound proofing of the hotel is excellent considering the prime location in the heart of NYC. We recommend the buffet breakfast. Plenty to choose from and the waiters were very friendly. In fact the last day we were given 2 tins of Doubletree Cookies by Steve a cook we spoke to a few times over breakfast. It was a really nice and that summed up the hotel staff. Every member of staff so helpful and kind. Tip for you - There is free wireless internet at the hotel reception and bar area.I recommend this hotel for a family stay in New York. I did look at other hotel but was very happy we choose the Doubletree Guest Suite in Time Square.
68,1791,"Sep 9 2009	Sweet Summer Deal not sweet for us	We decided on the Sweet Summer Deal for our trip to NYC with our granddaughters. The information on the web site did not state if the children(age 12) would need to order from the children's menu, so I called the hotel to ask. I was told that they could order anything from the regular menu. On our first night the waiter told us that the S S Deal required that the children order from the children's menu. I explained that I was told that the children could order from the regular menu. The waiter said he was sorry, but that was the rule for that special. I went downstairs and spoke with the manager. He also told me that the deal required the children to order from the children's menu. I pointed out that the rules did not make that clear, so I had called the hotel before making reservations. The manager then agreed contact the restaurant and tell them that the children could order from the regular menu. I'm not sure if the food we received was a result of going to the management, but our rolls were too hard to cut with a knife and the smoked salmon salads consisted of a small thin piece of smoked salmon with two little greens on top. We went to another restaurant later that evening for dinner. We decided that we would not eat lunch or dinner there for the remainder of our stay. The bottom line is we paid more than the basic cost of the room for the SS deal, thinking that the girl's lunches and dinner would be included. Because of our experience the first night, we had our meals elsewhere. We did not get what we paid for. I wrote a review to Doubletree, but they have not bothered to reply. The hotel was fine, and the breakfast buffet was fine, the lunch and dinner deal was a waste of money."
69,1791,"Sep 9 2009 	I loved this place	I will not stay anywhere else when I go back but here. Loved the beds, pillow and the LOCATION. It was perfect and the door man is so nice."
70,1791,Sep 7 2009 	Awesome experience! You'll LOVE it!	Just got back from a weekend stay at the Doubletree. We are a family of five and had plenty of space. We were able to check into our room at 1:30 pm. All of the staff from front desk to bell service to restaurant servers and bartenders and to security were top notch. Fantastic location - right in the heart of the action....but quiet and very comfortable when you are inside your room. We enjoyed a suite on the 42nd floor. Fantastic view! We would definitely stay here again!!!
71,1791,"Sep 6 2009 	Great All the way around	My twenty-something daughters and I just spend a week in New York in late August and had a fantastic time. Staying at the Doubletree was perfect. The location was great - there were crowds of people, but the minute we walked through the doors tranquility and cold air hit us like a pleasant breeze. Our room was great - it was clean and quiet and cool. Service was great - the night time cookies were the best ever."
72,1791,Sep 6 2009 	Fantastic location suiteprice 	We stayed at the doubletree for 7 nights at the end of August.It was our first trip to NYC with our 9 month old. Cant say enough good things about the doubletree-from the moment we arrived the concierge were very helpful to the cookies at check in which my sugar loving husband appreciated! We had a lovely suite on the 20th floor-plenty of space-seperate living room-with a mini kitchenette-fridge and microwave. A tip when travelling with babies-we brought a kettle with us so we could have cool boiled water for the baby's bottles. We had a very nice seperate bedroom so its an ideal set up when travelling with children. The location is perfect-in the middle of it all but yet nice and quiet in the hotel. We were able to get free wireless on our floor-not sure about the higher levels..All the staff were very helpful to us and room was kept very clean..We booked this trip 5 months beforehand and got a better deal per night so maybe good to book ahead of time..to sum up we would highly recommend the doubletree whether with children or just if you want an extra bit of space for all those shopping bags!!
73,1791,"Sep 5 2009 	Too Expensive	The location of this hotel is perfect. The staff is excellent (everyone, including Daniel). The rooms are nice. But the cost is way too high given room rate and extra charges for internet."
74,1791,"Sep 5 2009 	location is spot on	stayed 4 nights on our second visit to the big apple.awful check in-rooms not ready etc, eventually got our key 2.5 hours after arrival and after complaining!rooms are spacious, but it is a suite hotel so you would expect this.decor a little tired, everything else average.nothing special but then you dont go to NYC to sit in your room the whole time!would recommend pureply for the location but the service leaves a lot to be desired im afraid."
75,1791,"Sep 3 2009 	Best location in Midtown	We have stayed here several times and this was a special occassion...my wife's 50th Birthday. Jennie and Diana (front desk) were great and really came through to give us a special room and treat for the occassion. It has great views of midtown, in the heart of Times Square, yet quiet when you need a little &quot;downtime&quot;. Staff is great, made us feel like &quot;family&quot;....so good my wife still thinks she's &quot;49&quot;!!!"
76,1791,"Sep 1 2009 	Dealing with the front desk staff was a pleasure; Daniel Damaris Jenny and Stanley are great assets to this hotel!	Friends and I stay at this hotel every year and we are all Hilton Honors Members. We could not accomplish anything dealing directly with HHonors prior to our trip. Once we got to NYC and explained our dilemma to Daniel at the front desk, he immediatly without any hesitation told us what to do to be able to use our points for this stay. He saved us $350 dollars and was happy to do it! This pattern of excellent service was evident all weekend! Jenny gave us her &quot;10&quot; pins just for fun.... Stanley in security laughed with us everytime we asked him to take our photos... and we cannot forget Damaris! It all started with Daniel - Hilton should know these employees definitely have the companies best interest at heart! We hope they are there when we return next year!"
77,1791,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Location Super Comfy Beds Great Staff = Great Stay	Just returned on Saturday stayed for 6 nights, we have been here before it was over 10 years ago and decided to book here again as we needed a suite for my family. We had 2 rooms, 1 Twin bedded suite and 1 King suite on the 38th floor.Ill keep this as brief as possible: We had a fantastic stay and everything went very smoothly I would definitely stay here again if I return to NYC in the future.Liked Checked in at 1.30pm. 1 of our rooms was ready immediately which was a bonus Warm Cookies on check-in (Of course) also available when needed ? Fabulous views  Our room of Broadway - My families of Duffy Square (Upper Times Square) Beds were extremely comfy I slept soundly every night which is great for me as Im a light sleeper with a seriously bad back No noise Mini Fridge  Essential for a nice cold drink after you return from a hard day of sightseeing Never saw our maid, rooms were sorted by 4pm every day 2 Mirrors one in bathroom and one sink/Mirror unit outside the bathroom allowed me to get ready whilst my OH showered  Great idea ! Breakfast Buffet fabulous but very expensive  Best location - In the heart of Times Square, open the door to busy crowds but as soon as you shut the door ahh peace and quiet Subway (Local) stop right outside, Tours and TKTS also within a matter of feet Staff were great especially the bar staff  sorry guys/gals I cant remember your names Spacious Suite (By NYC standards)Disliked - a few niggles really We checked in early Second room wasnt ready (fair enough) when told would it would be ready within an hour it was over 2 hours  Just be straight and say over 2 hours I could have done some serious shopping in those 2 hours !! I thought our room was fine, my family thought their room was a little dated Wardrobe (Closet) Very small and dated, not enough hanging space or hangers for 2 people for 6 nights  although there were plenty of drawers Air con a bit noisy &amp; dated but cooled down the room quicklyInitially I was going to stay at the Affinia Dumont because of the better price and Tripadvisor rating however Im glad I stuck with the Doubletree its just in the thick of it and thats where we wanted to be - Plenty of bars/eating places nearby. We didnt wait more than 20 mins for a table and regardless what the locals say we didnt have one bad meal whenever we ate nearby whether it be breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinner. (Also whenever we dined further a field I must add)Just to add - the check-out letter you get under the door states there are no late check-out requests however we were advised to call the front desk at 8am on our final day and we were given an extra hour on both our rooms which was greatly appreciated  Thanks all"
78,1791,"Aug 30 2009 	Beautiful people	We did this trip more for the kids. Beautiful people Jenny at the front desk what a smile when she welcomed us. Danny and Michael the night Divas, I asked for cookies and with no problem we got them along with stories. I can't believe Jimmy the doorman is still there, he remember us from a few years ago. Thank god also for Antonio when we checked out he reminded us by saying I hope nothing was left behind in your safe or closet. That's went I remembered leaving some valuables in the safe. Doubletree home away from home. Thank you guys."
79,1791,Aug 27 2009 	Great location superb price/quality ratio	We have spent 6 days in NY in this hotel. Great location and excellent service. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. Daniel in the reception had great idea about the hamburgers :-) Next time in NY again in Doubletree.
80,1791,"Aug 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Fantastic Location with Exemplary Service	My wife, teenage daughter and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square August 20 -24. We were greeted quickly by a valet who ensured our car was parked quickly and then were greeted at the reception desk by Michael whose professionalism and wonderful attitude are very worthy of commendation and recognition. Since we were unfamiliar with this property and the room layout and locations, we let him select our room. We could not have been more pleased. The corner suite on the 18th floor was fantastic. The room and bathroom were very clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job making-up the room quickly when we went out rather early each morning. I could not speak more for the overall hotel staff; everyone we met was very helpful. In fact, returning late from the theatre on Saturday eve, we were very thirsty and asked a woman at the front desk if there was anyplace we could purchase water. She offered to have it sent up to our room. I'm so sorry I didn't get her name, but I know the manager reads these posts and I hope she is recognized. (By the way, the fact that the manager reads these posts shows itself a commitment to exemplary customer service.) The security at the hotel was fantastic. You had to show a room key before you could gain access. We always felt very safe and secure. The location was incredible - central to everything! I highly recommend this property and would not hesitate to stay again."
81,1791,"Aug 18 2009 	Great location	The Doubletree in Times Square is in the perfect location. It is right across the street from the new pedestrian only area of Times Square and the TIX location where you can get discounted Broadway tickets. The room we had had a partial times Square view and was in very good condition. All the rooms are two rooms our room had two double beds and a very large pull out couch in the other room, a good size bathroom a small kitchen area with a sink, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. The rooms were very quiet and comfortable which is nice after walking the city all day. The staff were very helpful especially the bellman and the valet for parking the car. Getting to the hotel was a chore due to the traffic in the city but once you get there the staff takes care of the rest. Parking was $35.00 a day in the garage across the street. The parking garage was very well run. Everything seemd to cost twice as much as in Florida. Prices did get cheaper the farther away from Times Square that you got and the choices are endless."
82,1791,"Aug 18 2009 	Great place staff and location!	We stayed here August 13 &amp; 14, 2009. From the moment we were greeted at the door by the security guard, to the receptionist on the 3rd floor everyone was very professional. Our only knock, we arrived at 11:00 a.m. and was told our room would be ready by 1:00 p.m. . We came back then, we have a 6 year old and he wanted to rest and the room was not ready, they kept pushing back 30 minutes. We went to restaurant, host sat us down brought us great, warm cookies and water, shortly after Diana from reception came and got us. Our room was ready by 2:00 and it was a great room, corner, looking south on Broadway. Room was very clean and comfortable. Though it was a non-smoking floor (only the 13th is for smoking) the room had the smell of smoke. We called and they said they would switch us our spray the room. We stayed and it turned out o.k. Highly recommend this place. Right in the middle of Time Square and everyone was very nice."
83,1791,"Aug 18 2009	This hotel has it all!	We have just returned from our fourth visit to New York City in 2 1/2 years, and our third consecutive stay at the Doubletree Times Square. I cannot say enough about how much we have enjoyed our stays there. Everything about the hotel suited our needs perfectly. Accomodations: We had a two room suite with two double beds .The room was large enough to comfortably accomodate our family of four adults. The room appeared to be newly renovated, was very clean, and was well maintained by the housekeeping staff.Location: This hotel is ideally located for shopping, dining,and especially for the theater and subway access. The theaters are all within a few blocks of the hotel and the subway entrance is just out the door and around the corner.Hotel Staff : The staff is as friendly and accomodating as you will find anywhere, from the general manager on down. Doris, Yaniv, and Daniel, at the front desk are terrific, as are all the others.I highly recommend this hotel, and will be staying there on our future trips to NYC."
84,1791,"Aug 17 2009 	Huge room great location and free cookies	Spent 3 nights at the Doubletree Suites in Times Square with husband and 2 kids (2 &amp; 5.) Booked 2 nights with points and paid for 1 night at a AAA rate. Got a 2-room king bed suite on a premium floor (actually the top 43rd floor). Kids slept on the sofa bed which was actually quite comfy for them, and we had the bed in a separate room. Shared bathroom with access from both rooms. Tremendous amount of space for NYC &amp; heart of times square location. Really enjoyed our stay and everyone slept great. And couldn't beat what we paid.Check-in on Thursday was a chaos but the hotel handled it well. Arrived at the hotel around 4pm to find the lobby full and a long line to check in. Apparently the hotel had a large group taking up the top/premium floors that weren't expected to check out until 6pm, so they didn't have many room available for checkin. As an incentive to get us to come back later to check in and get our room, they offered us a free upgrade to a premium floor (24th floor and up I believe) (versus the $5/night upgrade I'd pre-requested) plus breakfast for the 4 of us for each night of our stay. Breakfast buffet was $80/day for 2 adults/2 children so that was the real clincher for us. We took the offer and checked our bags until after dinner when we were able to check in for real (did have to wait in line again) and get our rooms (and free cookies). The hotel did offer water, fruit, juices and cookies to everyone waiting in the lobby for rooms so that was nice of them.We had 2 reservations given the nature of our stay (points + paid) and they were able to link them together at checkin so we didn't have to switch rooms. It did create a hiccup with the free breakfast on the 2nd day, but we were able to get them to adjust their records easily. I had a $50 coupon towards food and beverages that I got from their website which is good during a reward stay, but we ended up not using it since the breakfasts were covered, and it didn't apply to tips. But it would have been handy if we hadn't gotten the free breakfasts.Check out on Sunday morning wasn't bad but the hotel had given everyone checking out a note that checkout was supposed to be hectic and no late checkout requests would be honored. There was a running race going on when we left that meant we had to walk to 6th avenue to get a taxi, but it wasn't too bad otherwise. We never had problems getting a taxi during our stay, though if heading uptown it may be better to walk to 6th to get a taxi since the drivers have to go so far out of the way to turn back north around times square."
85,1791,"Aug 16 2009 	Superb New York hotel and great base for everything	Syated here in mid August with my wife and 3 teenagers. The hotel is on Times Sq (many claim to be, this one is right in the middle). The entrance from the street looks a bit odd and has a security guard. However, the reception is on the 3rd floor and from that point onwards the hotel looks like part of the Hilton group it belongs to. We were on the 25th floor, which is the lowest guest floor. Our rooms were excellent, each with a bedroom with 2 double beds and a separate lounge with a double sofa bed. We had 2 of these which were interlinked, making it a huge footprint. The rooms were very quiet, well equipped and large.We were give a free breakfast each day, which was buffet style and comprehensive. The staff were superb. The concierge booked trips for us at very reasonable prices and the front desk even offered to print out our boarding cards at the end of our stay.Given the location, right on Times Square, the hotel was very reasonable and provided a great base to see all of the Ney York attrwactions from."
86,1791,"Aug 10 2009 	Excellent Hotel/location	I choose this place after reading reviews, this is the first review a have ever written. The Doubletree TS was perfect, quiet, clean, suite type rooms. Peaceful in the room then walk out the door into the most exciting city in the world!! Never a dull moment. Staff friendly, concierge very helpful. If you can't have fun or enjoy yourself here, then stay home."
87,1791,"Aug 10 2009 	5 Stars for Convenience	This hotel was a great choice and is perfectly situated for touring the city &amp; seeing Broadway shows. The rooms are large and comfortable when compared to a typical Times Square hotel but, the Doubletree itself felt more secure than some of the obscenely large hotels in the area. This was most evident when the surly night-shift doorman checked guests for their room keys before allowing them access to the street-level elevators. Throughout our stay I was surprised that I never had to wait much more than 15 seconds for an elevator after calling for one. The 3rd level lobby elevators take you to your floor where you will find a mere 13 guest rooms each, a luxury in itself.Our 33rd floor room was very quiet and was what the hotel referred to as an allergy &quot;Pure&quot; room. These rooms have a large, portable HEPA air cleaner and the white-noise it generated while powered-on only added to a good nights sleep. The Hilton &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; bedding in these rooms also have special mattress and pillow encasements to help reduce dustmite and feather down allergens. All of the allergy-pure rooms are located on the 33rd floor so they're sure to have great views. One disappointment with our room was that it's 2 flatscreen HDTV's did not receive a HD signal... but, who goes to Times Square to watch TV?Our room was also one of the &quot;Times Square View&quot; rooms that ended with the room number &quot;03.&quot; This room really overlooked Father Duffy Square, which is part of what most people refer to as Times Square.(see photos) The best thing about the Duffy Square view room is that it has a 180 view of the city and is entirely surrounded with a curved wall of windows. The room is slightly smaller as a result of this layout but provides one of the most panoramic and romantic views available in Times Square. This room is perfect for couples or a small family and was very reasonably priced when I booked it JUST LESS than one month in advance through the Doubletree website. I guess they were trying to sell-off unused rooms because just a few days after getting my very low rate, the hotel was sold out. Don't forget that Doubletree offers a 10% discount if you have AAA.Note: The &quot;real&quot; Times Square view rooms end with the room number &quot;01&quot; but, have less windows. For New Year's Eve and the ball drop, this room cannot be beat.We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant but I did stop by after hours to check it out. It was nicely decorated and appeared to have a fairly big spread for breakfast. For lunch or dinner I suggest heading west to the 300 block of 46th Street, just west of 8th Avenue. There are a couple dozen nice, &quot;real&quot; New York City restaurants to choose from. The hotel's business center was easy to use and had no waiting line. For a $12 fee I used the center to print boarding passes, prepay checked baggage, and upgrade our seats in advance of the flight home... all of which would have cost at least $100 more at the airport.The car service we used to and from the airport provided curbside service at the hotel's front door. The doorman assisted us each time even clearing a us path through the crowd to our car when departing. Adjacent the hotel's entrance you'll find an enclosed Wachovia Bank ATM as well as an entrance to a subway station. There's a convenience store about 6 storefronts north of the hotel on 7th Ave., and the Times Square Information Center is 2 doors south.Overall, I'd have to say that the front desk staff and lobby baggage handlers were very helpful and friendly. The concierge was just average, and who cares if the young man working at the lobby's bar was less than interested in serving beverages. This is one of the few hotels in Times Square that provides an in-room refrigerator (and microwave), and it's nice to have a refreshment in your room while enjoying the view. This is NOT one of New York's trendiest or most luxurious places to stay but it is clean, secure, nicely appointed and reasonably priced. If the hotels in Times Square were rewarded stars for convenience, this one would surely get 5."
88,1791,"Aug 10 2009 	A great view in a comfortable hotel. Good for families with young kids.	We went to NYC for a long weekend with our kids, ages 2 and 4. From experience, we've realized that &quot;suites&quot; hotels work best for us because we can put the kids to bed early in the bedroom, close the door, and watch TV or read in the &quot;living room.&quot; The hotel worked perfectly for our stay. Times Square is mayhem and it was fun to be in the middle of it. The hotel staff was friendly and the concierge answered our questions about how to get tickets for Broadway shows. The hotel restaurant was empty when we got there but we ate at 6pm with the kids, so perhaps that's no surprise. The food was good and the waiter accommodated our picky eaters."
89,1791,"Aug 9 2009 	Excellent Times Square Location Large Rooms - Good Hotel	Our June 2009 stay at the Doubletree Times Square was the 2nd time I've stayed there - but for a variety reasons, it will probably be my last. While the Doubletree Times Square is in a fantastic Times Square Location - right across from the TKTS booth - it's just become too crazy of a location for my tastes - Especially with all of the Grayline Bus Tour Hawkers swarming people as they are walking down the sidewalks (Grayline Tours solicting there must be new in recent years as I don't remember this). This just leads to the sidewalks getting backed up and causing more mass confusion. Perhaps since I've been to NYC a number of times in the last 10 years, I'm now more open to staying off Times Square - however - still would like to be in the Theatre District - but more near Hell's Kitchen, etc. Anyways, if you are not one for being thrown into throngs of people as soon as you exit your hotel - I do not recommend staying here - but I do have to say that the Doubletree's room size is very large compared to other NYC hotels. Tons of space which we liked since we were in NYC for 8 nights. Another downside we experienced was due to the fact that we used Hilton points for our stay and this was the first time we ever experienced with a Hilton property/Marriott property trying to put us in a sub-standard room just because we used points (and a lot of points at that). The front desk treated us like we were country bumpkins and put us in a pretty crummy room - and acted like we were suppose to be grateful - well after us giving pushback they relented and moved us to the room that we expected when we booked - telling us the whole time that the problem was that we booked our room though the Hilton Honors line and not though the hotel directly, blah, blah, blah. Basically, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the Front Desk staff was off putting and I don't care if it's NYC or not - the bottom line is that NYC Tourism is suffering like everywhere else in the US and they are not booking all of their rooms (which was definitely the case while we were there) so they may want to take some customer service lessons from Disney, Publix, etc. However, the other staff members we ran into, the restaurant staff, engineers, bellmen, housekeeping, etc. were awesome, so that offset our snooty check-in staff. We basically ate in the hotel restaurant every day since we had free breakfast due to hubby's Hilton Honors status and we found it very good with lots of variety - but not sure if we would have eatten there often if our breakfast wasn't free since it was approx. $ 25.00 per person for breakfast - which is a standard price at NYC hotels - we would have eaten at delis or at PAX. Would I stay here again? Perhaps if the room was free - like it was this time - or it would have to be a bargain compared to other hotels . Oh, other complaint is that it didn't have free internet access in the room - could have free access in the business center or lobby. However, this is like many of the other NYC hotels - which is another NYC tourism issue."
90,1791,"Aug 5 2009 	Family friendly hotel in the heart of Times Square	We recently returned from a stay at the Doubletree Time Square in New York City. We searched at length to find a hotel that could accomodate a family of 5 (3 small children) in NYC. The Doubletree was one of the few that could. The location in Time Square was central to many attractions so that was good, however, the streets (sidewalks) in Time Square were super crowded so that was a drawback. Once you get a bit out of the heart of the madness it is much easier to navigate with small children or a stroller. (I had to make my ten year old hold my hand because the crowds were so thick there was no other way to stay together.) The hotel was fine. The staff was nice enough but certainly not top notch. They did their job and were polite. One morning at breakfast the manager stopped by our table to inquire as to our satisfaction with the hotel- that was a nice touch. The cookies on check in are DELICIOUS... that is definitely a bonus. The area is safe- I went out walking with my five year old at midnight one night to do a little souvenier shopping when neither of us could sleep- Time Square if full of tourtists well into the wee hours of the morning and all the lights make it seem like mid-day even when it is the middle of the night. I get weireded out about places being unsafe VERY easily so going out at midnight with a five year old is not the norm for me... it was THAT safe. The room was okay- again, nothing special. This isn't the Ritz or Four Seasons. It was clean... the carpet wasn't gross... the bedsheets were fine. The plug for the tub was broken so it would fill the tub even if you were just taking a shower (it was always in the down position) so we had to lift it up and lay it on its side for the tub to drain. Certainly the maids would have noticed that and should have had it serviced... but they would just knock it back down in there and we'd pull it back up when we got back to the room to shower that night.... like I said- not top notch service but this wasn't a deal breaker for us. We had a Time Square view room which was very cool and very entertaining for the little ones. The windows open out about six inches and have no screen... this was a concern to me but the kids were good about not playing with the windows so it turned out fine. we were on the 24th floor right by the elevator. We heard no elevator noise at all and only once heard some loud guests getting off the elevator on our floor at about 3am one morning. Other than an occassional siren- we couldn't hear the chaos of Time Square with the windows closed and the curtains drawn. The room was a suite but still small- very small &quot;living room&quot; area with pull out couch, a separate room with a king bed and a small bathroom. All in all, I would probably stay here again... it was fine. The price is right for the accomodations and the fact that they will take a party of 5 in one room."
91,1791,"Aug 3 2009 	Excellent location	This hotel has the best location in NYC. There is even a subway station next to the hotel lobby, which made it very easy to stop and drop shopping bags at your room and continue with more shopping!!!Also, the separate living area with a sleeper sofa is very convenient.I would have preferred if the vanity section of the bathroom were separate, to allow for more people to get ready at the same time, but you can't ask for everything.The rates were very affordable, and the location in a huge city like NY is #1 priority."
92,1791,Jul 31 2009 	Hard to find similar hotel in NYC	I visit NYC every 6 months and have stayed in so many different hotels by now. We booked Doubletree Guest Suites this time to celebrate a birthday and this hotel just beats them all! Having so much space in a hotel room in New York is a rare sight. Service was excellent. The location is unbeatable. Can't wait to go back.
93,1791,"Jul 28 2009 	Good hotel--Nice Location	We recently stayed at this Doubletree while on our first trip to NYC. We have two teenagers, ages 14 and 17. The hotel is nice, clean with spacious rooms. We were glad to have the extra &quot;living area&quot; with a pull-out sofa so that each child could sleep separately. Toiletries were nice and a small refrigerator and coffee-maker are in-room as well.The staff was very friendly. The concierge staff was just o.k. and seemed to know less about some things that were going on than we did. But they were very pleasant. One of the concierge staff was very helpful about the plays currently running and had seen many of them. The location is definitely prime. Close to subways and in the thick of Times Square. We were on the 38th floor so did not hear any street noise at all. Seemed very safe. During the evening they were fairly good about asking for proof of your key before you could get on the elevator from ground floor to the lobby.There is a little deli/store around the corner on 47th street where you can get hot breakfast sandwiches, bagels, juice etc at all hours. They were very friendly there as well. Nice for budget breakfasts and snacks.The Doubletree chocolate chip cookies were great as always. We managed to get a fairly good rate and were very happy with our choice."
94,1791,"Jul 24 2009 	We will definitely stay here again!	I researched at least 80 hotels before choosing this one. It was also recommended by a friend. I am very picky about hotels and this one passed the test. The location is perfect--right in the heart of Times Square. You walk out the door to the hustle and bustle of the city, but inside you can't hear a sound. The rooms are clean and spacious and have an additional mirror and sink outside the bathroom for ease of multiple people getting ready at once. There are two refrigerators (one stocked and expensive and one empty which is certainly handy). At night you must show your room key to security which is a good idea although I never felt unsafe there. My search for hotels is over when I return to the city. We will definitely stay here again."
95,1791,"Jul 23 2009 	Our Regular Hotel in NYC	We have stayed here three times now and looking forward to staying here many more times in the future now that we will have a son going to college in NYC. This place never disappoints. Great room, great, friendly service, clean, safe, helpful concierge. What more could you ask for? We love the location as it is part of the heartbeat of the city, close to theaters, subways, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I have stayed at other places in NYC and now will only stay here. It is like a home away from home."
96,1791,"Jul 23 2009 	Recent remodel makes this a much better hotel	I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square during a recent business trip. I needed to stay in Times Square to be close to my meetings. If you are in the same boat, or if you want to experience the hustle of Times Square, then this is a great place. If your business is outside of Times Square, then you may want to stay away. The recent remodel is a welcome change. The rooms are fresh, but the staff is still a bit off putting. I guess you have to consider that this hotel is positioned right in the heart of TS, where things move fast. If you want a slow-paced atmosphere---this is not it. Arriving at the hotel is now made more hectic thanks to the shut-down of traffic on Broadway. While this is great for pedestrians, it makes getting to businesses in the area difficult. While the street in front of the hotel is open, the increased traffic there because of the Broadway closure tends to clog things up---especially if you are trying to arrive around 5pm or depart around 8am. The door men here are great at getting people in and out of cabs--and almost as tough---across the sidewalk full of people. The new workout room is nice, with great new machines--but it would be better on a floor with a view outside. Instead, you overlook the lobby--which has also been redone in a Jetson's sort of motif. Having stayed at many of the hotels in the area, I'd rank this one in the Top 5 thanks to the new rooms and the relative price."
97,1791,"Jul 21 2009 	A quality hotel and excellent cookie!!	My wife and I stayed in the Doubletree for 6 days on our recent trip to NYC.From the moment you check-in to the moment you leave, they treat you very well.The welcome hot choc chip cookie is amazing.Our room was on the 32nd floor and had amazing views of times square all the way to the hudson river. We watched the 4th July fireworks through the floor to ceiling windows - excellent vantage point.The room is well equipped with a microwave, fridge, coffe-maker, mini bar (very expensive) Plasma tv, wi-fi , sofa bed and work desk and phone and safe. The bedroom also has a big tv and ample storage space and one of the most comfortable beds ever.The bathroom is also a good size.As you are so high up there is very little disturbance from below.All in, a great base for seeing the great sights of NYC."
98,1791,"Jul 20 2009 	Great Location Great Rooms Great Cookies!!	My husband and I just returned from New York and I would highly recommend this hotel to you! The location is perfect! Literally in the heart of all the action!! It was a little daunting getting out of the car with our luggage...but nothing that a little teamwork couldn't get us through:-) The hotel room is great: A proper living room/den with a pull out sofa, a mini fridge, a TV in the den and bedroom, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was a bathtub style with a shower head, and Wolfgang Puck coffee/coffee-maker in the room which was very good. The windows actually can open a little bit. The elevators are fast. And DoubleTree cookies are always a great bedtime snack! The noise from the street din't bother us in our room.The hotel is located directly across from the TKTS booth - but we were really happy that we had bought our tickets ahead of time because the line up were massively long especially in the hot sun. The Diamond street is just up 47th street!!! M&amp;M's, Hershey's, Toys'R'Us are just a few of exciting stores to see in Times Square.They say that you have to pay for the internet from your room and you can access their free WIFI in the lobby. We were on the 34th floor and easily - and happily - received great reception to the WIFI from our room.This hotel also happened to be priced better than most of the other options out there. The front desk told me that they are almost always sold out.The hotel is on top of a subway station and minutes walk from other subway routes. We found it really easy and SAFE to get around New York by metro. The commuters are happy to help direct you if you need assistance. (Although when we asked one transit worker which train to take to somewhere she replied with &quot;I don't know...I have never been there!!&quot; But honestly, buy a metro pass and go! Someone mentioned to us that they love the spa there. I personally don't have any experience with it.There is a huge presence of police and paramedics in Time Square. The hotel is on top of the West Side Story Production and just minutes away from the other theatres. We went to Citi Field (the old Shae Stadium) to see a Paul McCartney concert. We saw Billy Elliott and God of Carnage Broadway shows.We ate at Norma's, Ruby Foos, Basta Pasta, Carnegie Deli, Stage Deli and Nobu...and we thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend each one of these restaurants."
99,1791,"Jul 19 2009 	Don't think I'll stay there again if I don't have to.	This is a hotel with a superb location if the hustle and bustle of NYC is what you're looking for. Unfortunately, the service is very unpredictable and not standardized. I found the lower the person in the rank, the more friendly they were. The front desk people or anyone working in the lobby area, forget it. They couldn't be more cold and impersonable. The restaurant servers, the cleaning ladies, were more real and friendly in sincere ways. I was also surprised how bad the internet service was in our room, very-very low in speed, for both downloading and uploading, and that's if it was working at all. I had made a complaint, the outsourced internet company tried to fix to no avail, so I insisted that they reimbursed the charges and they did. Beware of the Business Center, it charged usage by the minute, and again with the very slow internet connection, I ended up paying too much just to purchase a museum ticket online. We stayed for 6 nights, and wished that we could've checked out much earlier!"
100,1791,"Jul 19 2009 	Great hotel great location great value!	The hotel is spacious by New York standards. Our family of five (including three teenagers) slept comfortably on the two double beds and sleeper sofa fitted with Doubletree's comfy bedding and pillows. The rooms have a small refrigerator and microwave, but you do not go to NYC to stay in the room. You go to see the sites and the hotel excels here as well. It is smack in the middle of all the action in Times Square steps away from the TKTS booth (purchase discounted, same day tickets to Broadway shows) with several subway stations justs a few feet away. I recommend the Edison Cafe (about a block and a half away on 47th street) for breakfast. Since you are in the middle of all the action it tends to be wall to wall people especially on weekends but you do not go to NYC if you do not like crowds. Overall, a great value especially if you book well ahead of your trip. Check the hotel's website for internet specials."
101,1791,"Jul 19 2009 	Gem of a location close to everthing	After struggling with the travel agent to find a single room in NY for 2 adults and 3 kids, at a reasonable price, we located this hotel. Fantastic location walking distance to everything, central park, empire state building, and of course Broadway.Staff very friendly, and hotel clean as a whistle. Rooms were a bit on the cramped side when the roll away was out but ended up only sleeping in the room as there was so much to do and see.Would recommend joining the Hilton honors rewards program it is free and i earnt enough points in for free night."
102,1791,"Jul 17 2009 	Drivers Beware!	The hotel was roomy enough for us and quite comfortable. We never waited for an elevator and any staff member that we encountered was helpful and friendly. It was convenient to the subway and there are tons of places to eat. I personally wouldn't stay in the location again I don't think, just because I couldn't stand the crowds around Times Square. But that has nothing to do with the hotel. We ate at the restaurant once which was really good but expensive. My biggest complaint was in trying to find either the self parking (no mention of location on the site) or valet (the site tells you to pull up to the loading dock on 47th St which doesn't appear to exist. It also says don't pull up in front of the hotel). After a trying time in driving around the city twice, I called the hotel and found out that the self parking was a non-descript garage down the street that said 24 hour parking. Okay, how was I to know that? The valet parking was available in front of the hotel, where the site tells you not to stop. Well, between the taxicabs loitering in front of the hotel and the few cars waiting there to load/unload there was no place for us to stop anyway. We traveled the streets again and ended up at the self parking garage, which was fine. Perhaps if staying there and driving, you might want to call the hotel first to find out what the latest parking instructions are."
103,1791,"Jul 16 2009 	Large comfortable rooms	My wife and I and our ten-year old daughter stayed here on May 29-June 2, 2009. My 70+ yr old parents stayed next door. The rooms are large and comfortable and with the adjoining suites our daughter could roam through 4 rooms. It was quiet despite the Times Square location (we were on the 24th floor). We visited the restaurant for the breakfast buffet each morning. It would have been rather pricey but Hilton Honors provided it for free. The staff there was extremely friendly and our daughter looked forward to her freshly made pancakes each morning. The hotel is adjacent to one subway stop and several more are within a block. The staff was able to provide directions and suggestions on several occassions. We had an excellent visit made more enjoyable by the quality of this Doubletree."
104,1791,Jul 15 2009 	Good in all respects	We are 2 English couples and we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of June at the start of our American holiday.Very central location with good security in the ground floor street level entrance lobby.The suite comprising bedroom and separate living room was clean and spacious with a nice sized bathroom and the maid service did a good cleaning job each day.We didn't eat in the hotel as there are far too many good and cheaper restaurants/diners within easy walking distance. The location on Broadway cannot be beat but that also means that the pavements outside the hotel get very busy especially in the evening.This was our 5th stay in New York and this was our cheapest hotel so far and gave far better value than the previous hotels that we have stayed in.We would stay here again without question.
105,1791,"Jul 15 2009 	Best Hotel Stay Yet	July 8  July 13, 2009 we had a wonderful experience at this location. The staff was great! On our first night, there was a problem with the TV. We called maintenance and they came right away and replaced our TV with a new one. When the TV went out it left a smell, dying TV smell. We asked if it was possible to change rooms. They sprayed this room and we could have stayed but they had a bellman there in less than 10 minutes to move us to another room. They were very professional, kind and accommodating - no questions asked. The staff is to be commended. Throughout our stay the restaurant staff beginning with the hostess, waiters and food prep staff went out of their way to make each meal pleasant. We had breakfast there every morning. My son looked forward to going; it was a very warm and inviting atmosphere - that says a lot coming from an eleven year old. The food was great as well. Housekeeping did an outstanding job. Our room was cleaned expertly every day. We requested extra towels and they were left daily without an additional request. The room was spotless upon our return. The bellmen were very helpful and were always asking ways to assist the guest. The concierge ladies did their job. They however did not exhibit the same warmth as the other hotel staff. There was a gentleman there on Saturday who was very helpful and greeted and assisted us with the same kindness as the other staff. The ladies did their job and were efficient, but were not helpful. They answered your questions with yes, no and I don't know responses. They also had nothing available from the hotel highlighting daily events in the city as most hotels offer. I had already mapped out most of our trip so it was not a problem, but I guess I was looking for the inside scoop from someone who lived in the city and who had experience directing guest to less advertised places. Overall we would rate our stay as the best hotel experience to date. We travel frequently and have stayed in many grand and great hotels, but the service and staff at this location are superior. Thanks for making our vacation memorable."
106,1791,"Jul 10 2009 	Surprisingly good	As with most TA reviewers concur, the extremely affordable Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square was a pleasant and welcome stay for part of our honeymoon. WE booked far enough in advance to get below $ 300 and received a room on a high floor that was clean and about average size for a midtown Manhattan hotel. Separate sleeping quarters with a very comfortable bed (that was welcome from all the walking) makes the Doubletree a BEST DEAL considering more upscale hotels in the area charging twice our rate."
107,1791,"Jul 7 2009 	Perfect Central Location!	Located in the middle of Times Square, across from the TKTS bleachers. Ground floor features a very nice-sized welcome area with a guard who checks room keys before you proceed to 3rd floor. 3rd floor fatures check-in, bar with tvs, etc. We NEVER had to wait for an elevator. Three elevators lead from ground to 3rd floor, then upper floors accessible by at least 5 elevators. We had 28th floor with a nice view of times square. We walked to Emipre State Bldg/Macy's, to Lion King (across the street - HELLO!), subways are VERY convenient (went to WTC and Yankees Stadium), walked to FAO, 5th ave, Rockefeller Center, to Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, Daisy May's BBQ, etc.The room itself is a bit cramped for 6 people, as the fold-out sofa takes up a large chunk of the living room area when opened up. Service personnel VERY friendly and helpful! Room seemed either too hot or too cold - hard to find the balance at times. Free wi-fi was adequate.Very QUIET! Never heard the sounds of the city unless you opened the windows. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! McD's next door and easy access to stores, eateries, you name it."
108,1791,Jul 5 2009 	Perfect Location	I took 3 teenageers to the city for an overnight. We booked the Doulbletree on hotwire for 199/night. We were very happy with the large room (1 bedroom suite) which had a queen size bed in the bedroom and a queen size sofabed in the living room. The bathroom was huge. We had a great view of Times Square. All-in-all it was perfect.
109,1791,"Jul 4 2009 	recommend recommend recommend!!!	I bid $200 on a 3 1/2 star hotel on hotwire.com, not knowing which hotel would be waiting for me at the other end of the &quot;send&quot; button. This was the hotel I received, I am thoroughly impressed with both hotwire and the Doubletree Suites. I had heard a lot about how small Manhattan hotel rooms are, since real estate is at such a premium in nyc. The Doubletree Suites are located smack dab in the middle of Times Square, and the room is well, a suite. We had a very comfortable king size bed, and the children slept on the pull out couch in the &quot;living room&quot; which was in excellent condition. The entire suite had been recently redecorated, and there were large, flat screen tv's in both the sitting area and the bedroom. There was also a mini fridge, a bar sink, an in-room safe, and the bathroom was spotless and very modern. We were lucky enough to get a corner suite on the 22nd floor, and we had amazing views from two vantage points. As for the cleanliness, this hotel room was immaculate. The sheets were crisp and new, and the room was cleaned to spotless condition both days we were there. The front line staff was uber-friendly, the concierge was likewise, and the guys at the baggage counter (bellhops?) watched our bags for the day after we checked out (for a nice tip of course).I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel. Spacious, modern, clean, awesome location, friendly staff; the Doubletree had it all.Oh, the chandelier in the main reception could use dusting. There, I found something negative. This was an awesome experience."
110,1791,"Jul 3 2009 	Not a great experience	Upon our arrival we were welcomed with warm cookies and upgraded to a king bedroom. The beds were comfortable and comparable to &quot;My Bed, Sofitel&quot;.The rugs were stained and old from the hallway to the bedroom. The bathroom was dirty, the paint was peeling, and the grout was old. Mildew covered all corners of the bathtub.We were charged $8.00 extra for a minibar that we haven't used before. The satff was rude.Overall not a good experience and I will not return."
111,1791,"Jun 29 2009 	Great Hotel Made Even Better By Daniel!!	We had put off going to NY all these years because we heard the people in NY were rude and unfriendly - but we took a chance for 5 days on our way to Europe. Well, we decided to stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites based on their wonderful reviews - and hoped for the best. The very first person we encountered in NY - after our taxi driver - was Daniel at the front desk. He was charming, funny, welcoming, and we truly appreciated his AMAZING room upgrade to make my 50th birthday celebration even more wonderful. We are Hilton Gold VIP members - and are supposed to get a room upgrade when one is available - but often the &quot;true&quot; upgrades are saved for the &quot;diamond&quot; VIP members - and we are left to feel less like &quot;gold&quot; and more like &quot;tarnished brass.&quot; But Daniel set the tone for our entire trip. He made us feel like VALUED family members - and the hotel itself is clean, spacious, and a welcome respite from the noisy world of Times Square just outside their door. Do take advantage of the fantastic proximity to all of the world-class Broadway shows within walking distance from the hotel. And by the way, we LOVED all the New Yorkers we came in contact with - so - don't delay! It was a most enjoyable trip!"
112,1791,"Jun 27 2009 	I love this place	If you want to stay in Times Square or Midtown area, I highly recommend this hotel. You get a full suite, with a completely separate living room -- not the traditional &quot;NY suite&quot;, which is a slight larger room with a two foot mini-wall dividing the &quot;bedroom&quot; from the &quot;living room&quot;. Most people would be scared of the noise being right in Times Square, but I usually seem to get a high floor, and rare hear much street noise, if any at all."
113,1791,Jun 26 2009 	An okay room	The price and lack of amenities make this room hard for me to recommend highly. It is a nice room. It is clean and has a decent amount of room to move about. The sofabed is okay but not that great. The hotel gives out free cookies after lunch. It has wifi but not in the room. If you want it in the room it is 12.00 a day. They don't have a complimentary breakfast but Mcdonalds is two stores down. Around the corner is a little shop that does wonderful breakfast sandwiches fresh. It isn't crowded or expensive. (when coming out of the hotel make a right around the corner and go about 500 yards.) My family loved the breakfasts from there. The hotel's location is excellent and right in the middle of Times Square.
114,1791,"Jun 26 2009 	GREAT HOTEL-GREAT SERVICE	This was our first stay at a Doubletree Hotel and it exceeded our expectations. We debarked from our cruise on Monday morning at 10am, and the hotel was a mere 8 miles from the Manhattan cruise terminal. Since we were early and we didn't call for early check in we had a little wait. As soon as a room was available we were speedily checked in. Ami at the front desk was very professional and courteous. We were offered complimentary breakfast for 2 for the duration of our stay, which we did not expect, but a great bonus nonetheless. Breakfast was good with a decent selection. The pastries were delicious! The room was spacious, clean and comfortable enough for 4 people. Housekeeping did a great job and there were always enough towels. There is a separate vanity/Kitchenette with coffee/tea maker and refridgerator and microwave and wetbar. The sitting area has a pullout bed, separate flat panel TV and desk.We did a city tour through Grayline Tours, and got our tickets in the hotel. The downtown tour buses pickup are very near the hotel, the uptown buses are about 1 block away (not too far). As for restuarants we ate at the Olive Garden which is in Times Square just opposite the hotel. This was the fastest sit down service we ever got!! The street vendors also sell good food at good prices and portions are large enough for two. One particular vendor sold Lebanese food on 42nd and 7th street, south of Broadway. Since it can rain at any time, its a good idea to have a poncho or umbrella handy. We did a lot of walking so comfortable shoes and a bottle of water were a must. Even if there are no kids in your party go and see the Toys R Us store. We had a great stay in New York City and we will definitely be staying at this hotel again when we plan our next visit to the big apple."
115,1791,"Jun 24 2009 	Good location for first trip to NYC .. big rooms ... service could have been better	We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was huge, with a bedroom and separate living area. Unfortunately it was RIGHT next ot the lifts (our door looked like one of the lifts). This wasn't a big deal though as you couldn't hear the lifts at all from the room. However the room became a problem when it started to stink of cigarette or cigar when we arrived back one night. This happened to us at two hotels in the US, what's that about !? We told reception and they acted shocked and gave us the key to another room, on the corner of the building which had a much nicer layout and therefore seemed even bigger. But when we went into the bedroom area the window was open and there was a packet of cigarettes on the windowsill, and someone had had a little lie down in the bed ! Back we went to reception where again, they were shocked. It was getting old at this point so we said they need to go and inspect the room before they give us the next key, which they did. We got another corner room on a higher floor which was perfect. The rooms have a kitchenette which was really useful, and the location is great you look down over times square (you can't hear anything though so you don't experience the downside of the location!). If we were to return though we would probably not stay in times square because its so busy and you get a bit sick of the salesmen all over the street."
116,1791,Jun 23 2009 	Great Hotel. Perfect Location.	Stayed here for 4 nights with girlfriends and we had no complaints. I recommend this hotel to anyone. Hotel is in the center of Times Square which made our stay even better. I definetly would stay here again. The room size was perfect. Beds very comfortable. Nice bathroom size. Thumbs up for Doubletree Times Square Suites.
117,1791,Jun 23 2009 	For Times Square I guess you cant beat the rate	Overall you are going to pay a lot for a hotel in NYC. Well in perspective this hotel might be a steal considering the prices of other hotels that look over Times Sq.Check-inThey were very helpful in that we had an extra room and they worked it our without charging us. (I think they were over booked so they were happy to do it.)The checkin was quick in the fact we were doing the room swap thing. RoomNice big rooms. I think they all have a living room area and also the bed room. More then enough room to spread around if you have a few people in the room. I also had a corner room so I'm sure it was slightly larger then othersBathroomNo problems here. Hot water was quick and I never ran out. Nothing special and nothing gross (which is a plus).TVI had a problem with the flat screen in the room and this is where they lost points for me. They wanted to send someone up to look at a TV that wouldn't turn on at 1:30 in the morning. The operator was just a jerk about it also. I did leave a note for the manager and never heard anything so I guess they really don't care that much. As for the TV's they were nice flat screens in both rooms.InternetThey had free wifi as far as I could tell but the connection sucked. I kept getting disconnected and got slow speeds. Same thing with my co worker on another floor.LocationVery good if you need to be in Times Sq. So remember there are always going to be crowds and its going to be loud. I was on the 29th floor and I could hear street noise sometimes. Also the curtains sucked so they didnt block out all the lights flashing. OverallI think its worth it if you want to be right in the middle of it there. Prices are higher but for the most part everyone was friendly at the desk and helpful except for that one jerk I got on the phone.
118,1791,Jun 22 2009 	Good location and room to relax.	We stayed at the Doubletree from June 12-19th. As a family with 3 kids we needed a room with some space. As things turned out our oldest couldn't go with us but the 18 and 15 year olds enjoyed themselves. They liked being in the middle of all the action and it was convienent to walk to so many places. We saw 3 shows while we were in town and all were easily reached from this hotel. There was a subway station right next to the hotel and several others close by. Having the McDonalds a few steps away was nice for when they got the munchies. It was nice having 2 TV's and 2 rooms. My daughter and I had separate mirrors in the mornings and my husband and son had separate sinks for shaving. Kept the conflict down. The first day we were there the bedroom TV didn't work but it was quickly replaced and we were given a free in-room movie. That night the tub didn't drain very well and we found ourselves standing in several inches of water during our showers. We called on Saturday morning and they spent 90 minutes on repairs but comped us the Sunday breakfast buffet ( 25$ per person) My husband wondered if he could find anything else that didn't work (Ha) The maid service was very good and Jimmy downstairs on the door was the best. Got an extra nice ride back to the airport due to Jimmy--so big shout out to him. Mid-week we recieved a fruit bowl and a tin of cookies. You don't get luxury but the service is good and the location is great especially with older kids. The crowds might be a little scary for very young children. If I were going back alone with my husband I might choose a hotel a little farther from Times Square and a little more romantic but with kids you can't beat the Doubletree.
119,1791,"Jun 20 2009 	Great location comfortable bed but a little disappointed	My husband and I stayed here June 3-5, 2009 and were disappointed with several things. The room was much smaller than we anticipated, bathtub/shower had a lot of rust in it, and the furniture was aweful. Now the bed was VERY comfortable and I slept like a baby. We stayed here back in 2001 and we had a fabulous room and it was a great stay. I just think with this being a very busy hotel they are just letting the age of their rooms show. The location is fantastic and the view from our room had a 180 degree view of time square, but I just don't think we would stay here again. The housekeeping was lacking also. Happy Traveling!! :)"
120,1791,"Jun 19 2009 	Excellent location with average amenities	This hotel is right in the middle of the action. Times Square and all the hustle and bustle that goes with it is right out the front door! The hotel itself is ok. The staff is friendly and the amenities are average. The hotel rooms and common areas are a bit dated. We ate at the hotel restaurant only once during a 6 night stay. The food was unremarkable. If you dont care about such things, but want to be close to the action, you could do worse than this hotel."
121,1791,"Jun 18 2009 	doubletree has action all around it	doubletree guest suites is one of the finest hotels in NYC. located just about 30 - 45 minutes from JFK airport, right in the heart of broadway. the entire locality is hustling and bustling with life and action. everything is like a block or 2 away from the hotel. shopping from the best brands to the best malls, restaurants of all types, broadway shows, times square .. you name it and its there. you get a panoramic view from the room as they are situated high above. the rooms are very spacious with a living room followed by the bed room. they provide in house entertainment like movies video games PS2 etc. since it is so centrally located you spend your entire day roaming NYC. i would recommend anyone staying in NYC that double tree is the place to be in. superb location, most curt staff, valet parking service, very confortable living.since the rooms are located quite high for us it was onthe 35th floor your right in the middle of action an yet away from the noise when you want to be."
122,1791,"Jun 17 2009 	Centric hotel	This is my favorite hotel in the Times Square area for two reasons. The space and the centric location. It lacks a good service response, a nice accessible entrance, it is not that quiet unless you book a suite in the higher floors, and it is a little expensive, but the extra space is worth it."
123,1791,"Jun 16 2009 	Fantastic view and wonderful room~ great hotel!!	When we first pulled up in front on the hotel in our taxi we were a little hesitant to get out as it was a busy Saturday afternoon and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into with the mobs of people everywhere! You enter into a small room with a guard at a podium who asks for your name on the check in list and sends you up to the 3rd floor. (at night you have to show your room key to the guard upon entering). When you get off on the 3rd floor there is a small bar with some snacks and a small lounge area and the check in counter. Everyone we encountered was very nice and helpful. We were told we were upgraded to a 'Conference Suite' and our Times Square view was granted. Our room was fantastic, it was on the 37th floor and a corner suite! We had a large bath (only negative ~one sink), nice sized bedroom with the most comfortable king size bed and a great view to look at over the nice desk. We had a dining room with a large wet bar and a coffee maker, fridge, microwave oven. The view was spectacular but the living room view was to die for. Our boys shared the pull out sofa bed which they said was very comfortable and they slept with the blinds open every night to take in everything. I also have to mention the room was pretty quiet too. As I type this sitting at the dining room table looking into our living room I see the '2009 and ball' that drop's for New Year's Eve. 360 views out of every window and and not into another building. We had paid for the breakfast included pkg which we were so glad we did because there really isn't a 'decent' breakfast place around that serves a full breakfast. The breakfast is a buffet with a large variety of food items.Everything is in walking distance, great restaurants, theater's and the 'tiks' booth across the street where you can stand in line to buy same day 1/2 price show tickets which we used twice! Also the hop off/on tour buses are also within walking distance.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a true NY experience!"
124,1791,"Jun 14 2009 	girlfriend getaway	This hotel offers the best location and arrangement for a sisters or girlfriend get away in NYC. We were in the center of it all and had a 2 room suite to relax and visit in when we weren't out and about. We think it is the only suite hotel in Times Square, too!"
125,1791,"Jun 14 2009 	Best Times Square view you can get comfy spacious suite	This was my 10th visit to New York. I stayed here 30th May for 2 nights, and paid $250 per night (including tax) in advance to get the cheapest rate. I chose a King suite with a Times Square view. I really liked the room. The bedroom is separate so you can enjoy a quiet night without being disturbed by any noise from guests walking past the room. The sofa-bed was fairly comfortable, and the fridge was useful. The giant flat screen TV in the living room did not work properly. I am sure if I had reported it I could have got it fixed, but we did not spend much time in the room. Check in and out was very quick and easy, and the hotel stored our luggage on our last day. The bar in the lobby was small and always very quiet; but there are many bars around the hotel for a more lively experience. The best thing about the room was the view. We could see all of Times Square. I dont think any other hotel in the area could give you as great a view  one that is now even more interesting since Broadway has been shut off to traffic and you can sit on chairs right in the middle of Times Square! I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis in a Times Square view room, and it was not as spectacular and cost a lot more. The area is obviously very busy all the time from the moment you step out of the hotel, but you only had to go round the side of the hotel and there was space to stand without being disturbed, or on the new light up red stairs above the TKTS booth outside the hotel . From my experience the rates at this hotel are usually pretty high; but if you can get a great rate like I did I really recommend the Doubletree Times Square. The following weekend I stayed at The Hilton on 6th Avenue, which was also very nice and I have reviewed this hotel too."
126,1791,Jun 10 2009 	Greatest location and room size!	Located in the hub of Times Square the absolute best location! Our room was totally quiet with no street noise. Comfortable and roomy accomodations and the staff was so great! The cookies are the bomb! Not one negative to comment on. Thanks for a great stay.
127,1791,"Jun 2 2009 	right on times square centre of everything	My Wife and 21year old daughter just spent 4 days of mayhem in Manhatten and in all honesty, I was dreading it, I really hate touristy stuff but my dear wife insisted we go. LOVED IT.....Great Place, Had an absolute ballAnyway the Doubletree hotel. 3 people in May 09 $600 a night excluding breakfast. Not bad for a room with one of the most iconic views in the world. (the one with the tickertape Wall street results and giant TV screens) I have paid a lot more for a lot worse.Clean, quite nice people, Really easy to deal with, A late check in no problem, maybe 5 minutes till we were in the lift. The room 1303 was a king suite, smoking, and had views both onto the square and up Broadway. Nice bedroom, lovely bathroom and a fine small lounge. Because we smoke, I tended to keep the lounge window open and the noise is amazing. Alarms screams, sirens, more sirens different sirens music, seriously NewYork do you really need emergency vehicles to scream at maximum volume at three in the morning. Did it matter, NO, if it had I would have shut the window. We slept the sleep of the dead due to extreme New York Exhaustion. If you want peace and quiet try Alaska.Breakfast was in a wee diner round the corner (We did not eat in the hotel) and was supremely New Yorkian in nature with massive portions. I dont think in the whole 4 days we had cause to talk to any of the hotel staff apart from the concierge on the last day. We got tickets for some shows from their booking people (Next to reception) and boy were they expensive. If you are able to plan things ahead, buy your tickets on the internet a few weeks in advance....much much cheaper. I dont care how good the show is, $200 for 2.5 hours of a broadway show is just too much particularily if there are several of you going.If you want to see a good broadway show then wait till it comes to a theatre near you.....For my wife and daughter, the fun was sight seeing and shopping and shows, for me it was museums, bars, archetecture, talking to everyone. I think the point is that no matter what you are after, You can get it in New York. Everyone had a great time and this hotel is perfectly placed to make it easy, Taxis to the door, 49th street Metro (The yellow R one) in the basement, (seriously) Red and Blue Bus tours across the road. and walking distance from more fun than should or actually is legal yet still safe at three in the morning (Well safe-ish)You will notice that this review doesn't say much about the hotel. Well thats because unlike many other hotels round the world they did not wreck my trip. They were easy, nice, simple and lots of other words that dont denote any ultimate highs or terrible lows and frankly in this city, thats the best kind of hotel you could ask for. You get the highs and lows out on the street, the hotel is for sleeping in and storing your stuff. Other stuff,A well stocked if a little pricey fridge and a spare empty fridge for the your own drinks and snacks, cool idea. (Pun intended)Internet..... Who the hell charges for internet these days.......No one except apparently cheapscate New York Hotels. $7.50 a day but totally worth it to find stuff in New York on google. I still think a con is a con though....Good security at night, you dont get past the front door without your key after about 8pm... Excellent idea in this area. Not sure what happens if you lose your key....Easy access to great food, great entertainment, great shopping Great bars and night clubs. Also available within easy walking distance is crap food, rubbish entertainment, expensive shopping for stupid people with too much money, Drink, drugs, rock and roll and well, an awful awful lot of fun. And the Doubletree guestrooms are perfectly placed for it all."
128,1791,"May 31 2009 	Great location service as usual	As a Hilton Platinum VIP, I stay in many locations in NYC. I was defaulted to this location due to NYU graduation and was concerned I would be bothered with noise. What a surprise! This place is sound proof and has now become my first choice over the Hilton Garden for future trips to NYC. The front desk staff is the best, I was treated great."
129,1791,"May 29 2009 	best hotel for kids !	I arrived at this hotel to be greeted with warm cookies! The staff were wonderful, friendly and efficient , I even got my meal free 1 evening because they were 10 mins late delivering it to the room! they even included more cookies for my 2 daughters to apologise for delay. the rooms are bright , spacious, sound proof,( v important when staying in times sq) I stayed on the 13th floor as it was a smoking floor but my views were still great and my room was cleaned and polished every day, I even received a note from the chambermaid one day to say thank you for the tips I was leaving! the area is great, tkts booth right outside, mcdonalds next door and toysrus 2 mins walk, subway entrance at the door of hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel for families but even for single travellers as no noise travels from room to room. I will def stay again, I got this hotel on hilton website and it was only $199 per night if booked few months in advance, fab price! security is great there as you have to go to the 3rd floor to get to the reception .great place!"
130,1791,"May 25 2009 	Fantastic place to stay with kids	I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to families traveling with children/teens. We have three kids (13, 9 and 6) and finding a hotel room with enough space for us all is a real challenge. The Doubletree had plenty of room, with two double beds in the separate bedroom and a large, comfy, pull out sofa. We stayed on the 16th floor and our room (which had a partial view of Times Square) was incredibly quiet.We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our requests for extra towels etc were attended to quickly. No request seemed like too much trouble. In fact the front desk staff were very indulgent of my kids, helping to fit batteries to their new toys aquired at Toys R Us (just down the street.)The location is great for kids. Everything you need (including a subway station) is right out your front door. There are loads of great places to eat nearby. My kids' favourite was John's Pizzeria.We had a great time in NYC, and our stay at Doubletree totally enhanced our experience."
131,1791,"May 22 2009 	Great Rooms Fantastic Location on Times Square	Doubletree Guest Suites on Times Square is a great place to stay. At the entrance to the hotel, there's a TKTS booth (where you can get tickets to shows on and off Broadway), Times Square visitors centre (you can get show tickets here too), Duffy's square which is great for people watching, the entrance to the 49th St subway station and the theatre where West Side Story is playing. You can easily walk to Central Park, 5th Ave shops, the Empire State Building and much more. We walked to the Winter Garden Theatre showing Mama Mia in less than 5 minutes. It sure beats staying further away and having to take the subway to all these places, especially if you have a group of 4 to 6 people (saves $2 per person per ride if you can walk.)The rooms are spacious and comfortable, good shower, large LCD TV and sufficient amenities for a comfortable stay. And despite its incredibly busy location, the hotel is very quiet. Go ahead, stay here!"
132,1791,"May 21 2009 	Highly recommended	2 other women and I stayed here for 4 nights in May. It is a great location and even though, very bustling right outside the door, the room was very quiet and comfortable. The 2 room suite was very spacious especially for NYC. The service could not be better from the front desk, concierge, bell desk to the maids - as good as I have received at 5 star hotels. The beds were very comfy but the sofa bed was not. The warm cookies were such a welcome treat and the mini bar was very convenient. The location is highly recommended for someone who wants to see the tourist spots."
133,1791,"May 20 2009 	A fantastic stay	My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree suites Time square for our annual mother's day trip. Everything about this hotel was excellent. The service at check in was quick and easy. The cookies were to die for. The room was a two room suite. It was nicer than I had expected. The room was clean, the bed was excellent to sleep in and the shower had excellent water pressure and tempature control. The location was fantastic, right on time square. There a broadway theatre next door playing West Side Story. There loads of restraunts with in a couple of blocks and the subway entrance is right next door too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know who headed to NYC. My wife and I will stay there again next time we go to NYC."
134,1791,"May 19 2009 	Excellent Value for money.	This hotel is in the ideal location for all sights ie, Rockerfella Centre, Fifth Ave in walking distance. Macy 's, Empire State Building, only one stop away on subway (yellow N).Grand Central Station only two stops away on subway (Green 6). Central Park walk in 15 minutes. Staten Island Ferry 5 minutes on Subway (Red 1) to South Ferry.This hotel is very comfortable, rooms are very large Living room with 32&quot; Plasma, plus separate bedroom with another tv, kitchen area with microwave, coffee maker with complimentry coffee, fridge. Massive king bed I got lost in."
135,1791,"May 17 2009 	Exceptional!!!	Our stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites was from May 8 - 12th and was everything and more that we had hoped for. Yes, the cookies at check-in are warm and delicious!!!! Loved the idea of having to show your room key to gain access to the elevators in the evening. The lobby is located on the 3rd floor and then you must take another set of elevators to your floor but they are so quick there was virtually no wait . There were four of us in the suite and upon arrival we noticed only enough towels for three, called their &quot;careline&quot; and before we knew it a knock came to the door with an ample supply. We also received a call to make sure the towels arrived - such good service!! The room was very spacious, the beds heavenly!!! The kitchenette area has a sink, coffee maker, safe, microwave and mini-fridge. Loved having a separate sitting area.This hotel is the best choice if you want in Times Square!! Just across the street is the TKTS booth which has tiered seating above it - these provide a great area to sit, eat lunch and watch all the sites of Times Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is the perfect place to stay expecially is you want to experience Times Square!! Can't wait to go back."
136,1791,"May 12 2009 	Absolutely fantastic hotel lovely staff best location	Spent a week here at Easter. Had a one bedroom suite, 2 adults and three children. Reception area was bright and modern, staff could not be more helpful. The room was spacious, however the double beds were a bit on the small side. The room was on the 26th floor, looking out onto Times Square. It was spotless clean, and well equipped with a fridge, microwave. A useful addition would be a kettle instead of the coffee maker, but this is only a minor complaint. The location could not be better, it's right in the heart of Times square. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, as there was much better value to be found outside. We will defnitely stay here next time we go to NY."
137,1791,"May 11 2009 	Wonderful Hotel...Great location!!!	Stayed here for a long weekend over Mother's Day. This was one of the best places we have stayed in the city. Extremely clean. Staff was more than helpful and friendly. Room was great size for myself, husband and 2 children. Had no problems with noise. We were on the 35th floor so I am sure that helps. Had room service one evening and it was fast and tasty. The location is what really put this hotel over the top. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do. If we needed to take a cab there were always plenty out front. This will be our hotel of choice from now on."
138,1791,"May 10 2009 	Great Place!! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! PLUS ++	Suite was PERFECT for Mother, daughter and aunt get-away!! Location is fantastic for theatres and dining! Staff is friendly, helpful, professional. Furnishings and amentities surpassed our expectations!! Will definitely return- as we think &quot;theatre get aways are going to be a part of our &quot;traditions!&quot;"
139,1791,"May 5 2009 	Excellent location great room!	This location is superb. Right in the heart of Times Sq. Walking distance to Rockefeller center and St. Patricks Cathedral. I did not have any problems with the noise but others may want to bring earplugs to sleep. The view of Times Sq. was awesome from the 16th floor. The curtains need to be closed at night to shut out all the bright lights. The room was ample and had a safe, a fridge, a mini bar fridge, microwave, coffee maker and bar sink. The elevators are fast and I never had to wait more than 30 seconds. The bar in the lobby is overpriced ($11 for a shot of Patron, $9 for a house Chardonnay) There is a security guard on the ground floor before the elevators that take you to the lobby floor. You need to show your key to go up. Cabs are plentiful and there are several subway stations within blocks. They have a decent fitness center.The big con is that you have to pay $12.95 per 24 hours for slow internet. That is a real rip off."
140,1791,"May 5 2009 	Good value if you need a suite	Stayed here 4 nights on family trip without kids. Mom stayed on sofabed, and complained about thin matress. The second day I told reception, and they put an extra matress there. That solved the problem. This meant that the sofabed had to be unfolded the rest of the trip. This was no problem, since my brother stayed in another suite down the hall.Helpful concierge, reception staff etc etc. We did not have the breakfast, there's plenty of nice eateries around the block.Best hotel bed ever, very quiet on the 42nd floor, convenient for three people, good coffee included."
141,1791,"May 5 2009 	Fabulous Place Fabulous Location	We arrived and were greeted by a very nice check-in attendant. From that moment everything went flawlessly. They assisted with tickets to the theater, recommended a couple of different places to eat, and best of all they had a &quot;pure room&quot;. Since I have asthma, it was a no brainer to try this place and we were not disappointed.We will be back."
142,1791,"Apr 30 2009 	Excellent Location	We stayed here for 3 nights in April 2009. Couldn't have picked a better location. Right in the heart of Times Square and right next door to a subway station.Location:Being right in TS, the outside doors tend to get a little crowded, but nothing major. You have to get on an elevator to get to the lobby, then another elevator to get to your room. That become a little 'annoying' after a few trips.Lobby / Amenities / Staff:The lobby feels a little crowded and looks NOTHING like the pictures on Hilton's site. I didn't notice any construction, but maybe that is the goal... We didn't use the fitness center, but walked through and it was pretty small. The business center was very hot. I used it to print a few items and had some minor problems which were resolved fairly quickly.I used the pre-order feature which allows you to have items (extra towels, pillows, toothbrush, etc.) to order a dental care 'kit'. That wasn't in our room when we arrived, but I called down and they delivered it within 5 minutes.We ordered a cheese/cracker tray which was good, but VERY overpriced. Staff was outstanding overall. We had an issue with 2 employees (one front desk, one bell boy), but everyone else was extremely helpful and friendly.Room:We had some HHonors points, so I can't speak to the value, but we were on the 29th floor with a times square view. We were on the corner so we could so both ends of TS and the water from our room... It was outstanding!All of the corner rooms are right next to the elevator, but I didn't really notice once inside. I only heard them in the bathroom, but not at all in the living room or bedroom. The room (suite) was on the smaller side compared to other DoubleTree's I've stayed in, but probably very large when compared to other NYC hotels. The beds were extremely comfortable. We haven't slept that well in a long time. We couldn't really hear any noise from the ground level unless you opened the windows.Bathroom was half remodeled, but the shower was very old. Overall, we couldn't have imagined a better location and overall experience. Definitely recommended (Especially if you have HHonors points!)We had very low signal on the wireless internet in our room. I never brought this to the staff's attention, but it did get quite annoying (on again, off again)."
143,1791,"Apr 29 2009 	Great Location...worth the price!	We just returned from a 3 night stay. There were 5 of us so the suite suited us just fine as it has two doubles and a pull out couch. The location in Times Square is awesome!! Subway is right next door, lots to do right when you walk out the front, quiet when you need it as well. The room has a fridge and a microwave so we stocked up on drinks and snacks to save a bit. Lots of delis and other restaurants are right there as is the discount theater ticket booth. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
144,1791,"Apr 25 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised!	We were pleasantly surprised how great this hotel was! Yes--it's in a BUSY location--so, it's not the easiest place to just pull your car up and unload your luggage. However, the bellstaff are very helpful and friendly. They do a great job considering the busy entrance!We had a room on the 33rd floor. It was a &quot;Pure&quot; room (clean air). And I have to say--it does make a difference! Room was spacious for our family of 4 and surprisingly very quiet! I never heard a toilet flush from another room, never heard a peep from neighbors and couldn't hear any traffic noise from outside. Very comfortable bed! And a very clean room!Great view from windows!! My son just loved sitting at the window and watching the sights!We never ate at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.But overall, a great stay! I would definitely stay here again!"
145,1791,"Apr 23 2009 	Right in the heart of NYC	A great location for our spring break stay. We had tickets to West Side Story and 9 to 5, and we were able to walk to all the shows. TKTS is right across the street. The entryway is right off the street and has security after 10:00 at night. The lobby is on the 3rd floor and the registration staff were pleasant and accomodating. The big plus is the warm, chocolate chip cookie given to each guest upon arrival.The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping was excellent. Our suite had a large sitting room with a big screen TV. The bedroom had two double beds and plenty of big plump pillows. The thermostat was easily adjusted (which I find is not the case in most hotel rooms lately). The price is a little higher than some hotels in the city....but that's NYC. Would definitely stay here again."
146,1791,"Apr 23 2009 	Superb Location - Very Decent Hotel	This is a standard large hotel, perfectly located. The hotel is right on Times Square, across the street from the discount ticket office, close to a subway line, and within walking distance of Broadway theatres and lots of restaurants.The staff were uniformly pleasant, but be advised that the staff is small for the size of the hotel, the lobby is tiny and is actually on the third floor (one set of elevators brings you up from the street on 7th Ave to the 3rd floor and you must transfer to another set of elevators to get to your room). We stayed in a suite with a king bed; the rooms are not large, but quite reasonable for New York. The two rooms, a bedroom and a sitting room with a pullout couch, were clean, with a small fridge, a pod coffeemaker that can brew two cups at a time (youll get two caf and one decaf pods a day), two TVs, a desk, plenty of drawer space but there is limited space for hanging clothes. The room was remarkably quiet (if there is traffic noise, check to make sure the windows are tightly closed!).We ate at the restaurant once and had the breakfast buffet; the price was typical for NYC, but they do omelettes, French toast, and pancakes to order which is a nice touch. Service was adequate, but not extraordinary.There were lots of families, many with elementary school aged children, and so the elevators were almost always busy, and sometimes noisy, but not obnoxiously so.BOTTOM LINE stay here for the superb location and because this is a decent hotel. If you are looking for luxury, then go elsewhere and pay more."
147,1791,"Apr 15 2009 	Enjoyed our visit...the best beds we've ever slept on.	The location is perfect for enjoying all that Times Square and the Theater District has to offer. Being on the corner of 47th and 7th, you're literally in the heart of it all. Yes, the sidewalks can get quite congested, but it's Times Square. There are several subway stations in the area. Overall, the service was nice. Hot warm cookies at check-in were a plus. We had an issue with our safe and it took them only 5 or 10 minutes to have a serviceman at our door and the problem fixed. The rooms are all suites so they're plenty spacious which is really nice after a long day of hitting the sites. The bathroom amenities are top of the line Nutrogena products so no generic stuff. They even provided sunscreen. And there's a television in both the main room and the bedroom. And the beds....wow, the beds....Hilton rightly coined them their Sweet Dreams experience. If only all hotels had such wonderful beds and pillows. My wife and I had no trouble sleeping at all. We'll have no qualms about booking this place for our next visit."
148,1791,"Apr 14 2009 	Great Location	We visited the Doubletree Guest Suites as part of a New York holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary and used my husband's Hilton points. This got us a very good breakfast as part of the deal. The hotel is ideally situated for shows etc, even though it can be exceptionally busy on the sidewalk beside the hotel, making bringing luggage in etc. a bit difficult. However, our room was great, clean and comfortable. Only issue we had was the fact that during our stay there were weddings on every night which meant there was no access to the restaurant and nowhere in the hotel where you could get a coffee. The bar is pretty lifeless and unattractive but because of the location and all the places to go nearby it was not a major problem."
149,1791,"Apr 13 2009 	Unexceptional service but beautifully furnished hotel	I had a special free breakfast or free parking rate. This very expensive all suite hotel is located in Times Square, so its location is ideal, but it's arguably the busiest place in Manhattan, so don't even plan on parking here (I tried and it gave me such a headache I parked in New Jersey and took the train to Manhattan). The free breakfast? - well, the cordial but relatively unfriendly hotel clerk did not even mention it (I had forgotten about it). I overslept and it was too late for breakfast anyways. The wireless and connected Internet does not work on high floors. Wireless internet is free in the 3rd floor lobby and 5th floor restaurant/lounge, though there is a hefty fee for &quot;using it&quot; in your suite, if you can manage to find a connection in your suite. The suite was beautifully furnished, a very comfortable bed, and Neutrogena toiletries. Overall, definitely too expensive for the price paid, but if money is no option, the location is ideal. The chocolate chip/walnut warm cookie given at check-in was definitely a nice touch, though."
150,1791,"Apr 13 2009 	Best kept secret	I took a family group to NYC over Easter weekend and stayed here using Hilton points. The two beds and sleeper sofa easily accommodated our group of five. You could not get a better location for touring, nor could you find a nicer, more helpful staff. The most comfortable beds ever, and good food, too. The hotel is not fancy, with very modern decor, but it is quiet despite its proximity to Times Square, and was just perfect for our needs. We saw two shows, and took a tour with Onboard Tours, which was the highlight of our stay. Just wonderful. I will address in a separate review. Stay at the DGS. You will not regret it."
151,1791,"Apr 12 2009 	Exellent view of Times Square Great Suite and Value	Upon arrival, the front desk had our reservation wrong but quickly corrected the problem. We really enjoyed the suite, having 2 tvs and a corner room (conference room) which gave multiple views. Good location. Rooms were clean. Enjoyed the cookies. We did not go to the restaurant. Be careful with the minibar, as it mischarged us and had to get the bill corrected. Overall, we would definitely stay here again."
152,1791,"Apr 12 2009 	great hotel and location for family of four	We, family of four (kids ages 8 and 10), just got back from a five-day trip to New York City and it was absolutely wonderful! The Doubletree Suites are located right on Times Square, very busy area but close (walking distance) to theaters and other sightseeing. Very safe area, lots of police all around. We lucked out with a corner hotel room (#1203). King-size bed in bedroom, sleeper sofa in living room and eleven windows looking out on Times Square where there were nine tv screens to watch. The kids loved this and would just sit in front of the windows in awe. Other hotels in the area are the Marriott Marquis and Renaissance but the suites at Doubletree are l(much) ower priced. It was great to have a suite so after the kids went to bed the adults could stay up. Having tv's in both rooms was a nice touch; early riser kids can watch tv before the rest of the family has to wake up. I knew hotels in this area do not offer free breakfasts so I usually went down to McDonalds or Jamba Juice (across the street or next door) to pick up something to bring back to the room. Other times we went to deli's in side streets and ordered food downstairs at the counter before taking it upstairs to the 'dining' room. We had very good dinners on 9th Ave and 44th street, at Marseille (Michelin recommended) and Nizza (italian). Having dinner on Broadway/Times Square is not advised; it's just too crowded and hard to keep an eye on your kids while you order at the counter and carry a tray. The hotel was great and we felt very at home. Clean, quiet, wonderful beds, big and soft towels. Requests for extra blankets (it was cold and snowed one day) were immediately satisfied. Free cookies were a nice touch. Price and value match well. (Just don't eat at the hotel or order room service; very, very expensive even for New York standards but we knew this ahead of time through reviews.)"
153,1791,"Apr 8 2009 	Great location in very busy part of the City!	My wife and I spent a Saturday night here in Mar09 to celebrate our anniversary. The hotels location is perfect if you want to spend lots of time in Times Square/Theatre District. It is across street from the new TCKTS booth (cool design) and next to the theatre playing West Side Story.We found the service to be good and the room just awesome. Our room had a great view of the New Years ball. It was just delightful to watch the people and lights in the evening.One complaint, the couch in the living area was really bad. The cushions were way to small and kept sliding off the couch. Just wasn't very comfortable to sit on while we watched a movie on the big screen TV. I wish we had chosed to watch the movie in bed instead, but I thought it would be better on the bigger TV. None the less, the hotel was just wonderful."
154,1791,"Apr 7 2009 	Spamtastic!	My first time in NY, I decided to stay at the Doubletree! The location is right in the middle of everything. Walking distance to anything you need, while in NY. The theatres are only a few blocks. The rooms were not small. I booked a king bed, and they are not lying when they call them &quot;dream beds&quot; I don't even sleep that good at home, like I did there! The lights are bright, but they have black out curtains, barely hear any kind of street noice. There are two TV's, a mini-bar, refreshment center (micro, fridge, coffee maker) and a safe. The coffee is wolf-gang puck! I couldn't drink enough of it. Also has tea, cups, ice bins (ice machine on the same floor) and mini bottles of shampoo, body lotion, facial scrub (room service gives you more each day) The towels are plush, unlike other reviews, the water pressure is awesome (did not turn hot and cold on me) All and all, it's a simple hotel for the busy life of NY. If you like fancy, then I don't recommend it, but if you like to kick your shoes off and feel at home, then doubletree is perfect!"
155,1791,"Apr 2 2009 	If you're in the city for theatre...cannot beat the location	This was my first time at the Doubletree Suites Times Square in NYC. To compare, I've stayed at the Waldorf, Plaza, Sheraton midtown/7th (forget which one...they're basically interchangeable), Marriott NE side, Marriott Marquis, some I forget...and even the Milford Plaza! I was in town for just 2 days-mostly shopping and theatre. I don't really like the Times Square area due to the crowds, but I wanted to be able to walk to all my theatres because I hate to try to find a cab after, especially if it's raining. So...Doubletree had a FABULOUS rate at $164. I opted for a $179 rate for a similar room, but with a view and on a higher floor. Turns out this was a waste as the view was nothing to speak of. All the hotels were offering great deals during this time. But Doubletree offered the rate, location, AND a 2 bedroom suite. I couldn't say no.I arrived early in the day and my room wasn't ready. I am a travel agent so I checked the day before to see if they were full, knowing I'd arrive early, and they weren't. My assumption is that they wanted to keep their guests on as few floors as possible, for housekeeping, safety, elevator use, and the fact that they were renovating. No worries. I stopped back and still no room. That's OK, still early. By early afternoon I was exhausted so I checked again, no room. I went to the restaurant for tea, but was told &quot;we'll have a server bring some out to you&quot;. The idea was to find a nice comfy place to sit and relax while I waited on my room. I was pretty offended and went to my old standby, the Marriott Marquis for tea instead. The Doubletree is on the corner of 7th, 47th, and Broadway..just at the corner of the new TKTS location. Bold splashy sign, but tiny entrance with doorman and security. Heated lights in the overhang above the entrance are a nice touch. Inside...you're usually asked to show your room key in the evening. Elevators up to 3rd floor are quick - you never wait more than a few seconds.The lobby is small, with a few seats, check in desk, bar (never open when I was in the lobby...which was a lot...don't know if it's closed for the renovation or ?), BUSY bellmen (mostly storing people's luggage for their room wait or for the day after check out), and a concierge desk.Restaurant is on another floor, with tasteless blood red walls in the hallway...which reminded me of The Shining . I'd heard poor reviews of the restaurant. The tea incident didn't help. Then we ordered room service one time and it sealed the deal. Bad. Really bad. If we weren't RAVENOUS...I'd say definitely inedible. Check in was quick and I was offered the required Doubletree cookie...which I declined. My daughter was joining me later that evening, and they said &quot;only one of you right now&quot;...and were only giving me one anyway so I didn't want her to not have one so I said no. They told me earlier I had a package with an amenity and they'd give me a coupon when my room was ready. I never got that either, and forgot to ask again.We had a room on the 41st floor facing...ummm...I have no idea. But you could see the river from the window in the hall near the elevators. The room was huge. HUGE! Living room with a pull out sofa (the cushions on the sofa are a hot mess...you can't even sit on the sofa without them slipping off), desk and chair, another chair, TV on a huge credenza that housed a mini bar. In this same room was a long kitchen bar with a sink, coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee (we brought our own tea so I can't comment on the taste of the coffee), fridge...probably a microwave but I didn't see one. The fridge was cold too! Imagine. Those little fridges never seem to keep drinks cold. The bedroom had 2 double/queen (?) beds and the bedding was very comfortable. Tons of pillows. A large cabinet with an ironing board and iron, probably a TV, I never looked. The bathroom was very nice. Tub. Toilet. But a long (marble?) vanity with two sinks, hairdryer. The trash cans were divided into recyclable and rubbish sides. The windows in the rooms opened. The temperature control was easy and the room cooled/heated quickly when asked. There were a lot of families at the hotel, very few business people. The size of the rooms and location are, of course, the reason. But there is a 24 hour business center and I think 24 hour workout room. We didn't have time to visit these. Overall: Front desk personnel were adequate, lobby and bellmen were very nice, rude service waiter was extremely rude AND the food was bad, location great, room great, housekeeping was excellent!. It happened to be a great deal for this trip. But I'd definitely pay a lot more for the hotel, if I wanted to be in this area. BUT...I'm ALWAYS needing supper after theatre and, as I travel with my daughter, don't always like to stay out late to do that. We partake of a lot of room service breakfasts and suppers. So I probably wouldn't select the hotel again mostly due to that reason (as well as a couple of gruff staffers...I'm really big on service...I know this is not a price point where one can expect much...but good service is free). Still...all in all...a perfectly adequate hotel depending on your standards for these things. The room and location are fabulous."
156,1791,"Mar 26 2009 	Great location; comfortable for a family	My family of five (2 adults plus 3 children) spent 4 nights at the Doubletree Guest Suites. You can't beat the location if you are sightseeing in Manhattan. We saw a couple of Broadway shows, and I was so glad that our hotel room was only a short walk away when we got out of the show late at night. The kids loved the impressive view of Times Square from our 10th floor room. We had a suite with King bed in a bedroom, and double sofa bed in a small living room area. The sofa bed wasn't (they never are) but the King bed was more comfortable than average. We had adequate space and were comfortable in the room. The front desk and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. There was a small mistake on the bill and the front desk clerk cleared it up immediately. Warm chocolate chip cookies upon check in and check out! I would definitely stay here again."
157,1791,"Mar 25 2009 	Great Location if you want to be in the madness!	Stayed here for 4 nights with the husband on our first trip to NYC. Check-in was quick and we were upgraded to a corner room overlooking times square on the 28th floor. The room was great and we were pleased we paid a bit more to stay in a hotel with suites as it was good to relax on the sofa at the end of a tiring day seeing the sights. Hotel is in great location if you want to be in the thick of things and right opposite the half price theatre ticket booth (which now takes credit cards). We were in easy walking distance of all the main broadway shows, 5th av., central park, empire state and Madison square garden etc. Loads of eating options close by, but the dismal exchange rate makes everything expensive at the moment. The only negative we had was the concierge-not amazingly helpful and quite dismissive despite there being no-one at the desk behind us. A minor issue though and we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.P.S. Avenue Q is fantastic!"
158,1791,"Mar 21 2009 	Excellent Service	Stayed here for my second trip to NY.The check in was quick &amp; simple,efficient whilst still friendly.At our last hotel it was slow,indifferent &amp; we had to change room,so a big plus!Whilst there one of us was ill &amp; we asked for the cleaning staff NOT to disturb our companion confined to bed.What impressed us was that they knew the room hadn't been cleaned &amp; rang in the evening to see if we would like it doing then.Also,the concierge confirmed our flights for us &amp; checked us in...a welcome load off our minds when trying to do this from abroad.At all times staff were attentive,helpful,smiley...without being insincere sounding.What with this,the location &amp; quietness of the rooms,I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.Only slight niggle is that from the British perspective,a kettle,not a percolator &amp; some crockery would've been nice,We like our tea!!But this is the fault which made the whole stay perfect...very minor!!"
159,1791,"Mar 18 2009	Very average hotel fantastic service	My mom and I stayed her for an extended weekend trip to NYC. We are regularly in NYC and have stayed at many hotels in the theater district and around Times Square. This hotel is extremely average in all categories, except for service. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a conference suite by a very friendly gentleman at the desk. All the staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome in their hotel. The room itself was very dated in decor, though they have upgraded the beds. The bathroom was large though, and the neutrogena ammenties were replaced every day. The windows offered a panoramic view of Times Square, and you could shut the lights out with the shades at night. We had a drink in the lobby bar one night -- the drinks were good, but very pricey. $14 per drink is a little steep, even for New York. The lobby bar is beautiful, but as a previous poster mentioned, it's not private or secluded -- it's right in the middle of the check in/out madness and next to the elevators. The elevators were faster than I expected, and we rarely had to wait very long for an elevator, even though we were on one of the higher floors. The wi-fi was TERRIBLE while we were there. It faded in and out, and often didn't work at all during half of the stay. At $12.95/day, I expected better. Overall, it's a pleasant enough stay at the right price, but had I paid the $3000 they were asking for New Year's Eve 2008, I would have been severely disappointed. However, it is not one of my favourite hotels in the area, and I don't know that I would return. The hotel is rather bland."
160,1791,Mar 16 2009 	Best hotel in times square	I stayed in this hotel march 3rd till march 6th 2009 I had a corner times square view room and have to say it was a great room with an amazing view.. The room was a good size with a living room a separate bedroom and bathroom it was very clean and bed was very comfy. Its in a great area right in Times square lots of food places and shops close by I would stay here again...
161,1791,"Mar 10 2009 	Perfect for a Theater Stay	I was so pleasantly surprised by this property and will stay there again. Quite simply:Pros: Great room. I had a double suite on the 28th floor. You pay a little extra for this room, but it is totally worth it. Very up to date furnishings. Both rooms, the living and bedroom were large. The room was completely quiet and had a great heating cooling system. The bed as others have said was great. Enough plush towels and clean. There is a mini bar, ice machines on the floor and two TV's which came in handy with my teenager in tow. I have no complaints.The service was very pleasant from the Front Desk to the security at the entrance. No one is allowed to just wander into the hotel from the street. You must show your room key to security on the street level and then take an elevator to the lobby where the room elevators are found. The security guard was very helpful when I asked him how to get to the subway- I honestly didn't expect him to be so nice. Room service was prompt.The location was outstanding - right across from the discount Broadway ticket booth and only a few blocks from just about every theater, quite a few subway lines, and some nice restaurants on 8 and 9th Avenues(Hell's Kitchen) for pre-theater dinners. They have a concierge at the front desk from 8 am on. I wish I had known right away because I believe you can also purchase show tickets at her desk. Instead I had my husband order them from home on-line and could not pick up the tickets until 1/2 hour before the show at the theater. There is wi-fi in the room that worked with our i-touch.Cons: Nothing that would prevent me from staying here again. The lobby is nothing to speak of and didn't seem to have any windows. So, it is not the place to make a splash if meeting someone. The outside marquee is a little over done for my taste, but when I was looking for the hotel after a long walk, it was a welcome site. Room service charges were a little overdone. This is not a &quot;trendy&quot; hotel so if that is your goal, don't stay here. This is vanilla ice cream."
162,1791,"Mar 6 2009 	Great location for New Years party- if that is what you are there for!	Stayed here many times. We got a very small room this time - but the view of Times Square was incredible. We looked right down to the stage. But, get ready. It is crazy - tons of security to get through to get pass baracades. After 5 pm you had to show a special badge to even get back to the hotel. Once you go out of the area you can't get back in if you are not staying within the cooridor. Many people had to stand for 6- 7 hours. Saw lots of them with little kids - which was crazy. - so if you are going to watch the ball drop - the Doubletree is a great hotel and good value considering the rates at that time in the city."
163,1791,"Mar 5 2009 	great value for Times Square location!	This was my second stay at Doubletree. Check-in went smoothly and I had a king bed suite on the 31st floor. Only no looking down upon Times square this time. My $169 seniors rate only gave me a side view, but that's OK. The room was clean as was the bath and the bed was maybe the most comfortable I've ever experienced. The sitting room TV was a good size wide-screen model. What I don't like though is the menu you have to navigate to get to the TV channels. It would be nice to be able to immediately choose TV when the set comes on, but this is a minor quibble. I had asked for extra coffee when I made my reservation. And there was plenty awaiting me. Probably 10 extra coffee packets and creamers. Wireless Internet access, unlike last time, worked properly and I had a decent connection every time. (On my prior visit I was on the 17th floor and had to get a gadget from the front desk to get any connection at all.) The people at the concierge desk were always helpful and willing to answer questions. When I told the lady I liked British fare, she recommended a place just around the corner that served Cottage Pie and such. I tried the Bangers and Mash dish (sausages and mashed potatoes) and while it was tasty, the sausages were American, meaning totally wrong flavor. Another day I found a wonderful steak place that was also just around the corner. You were served cafeteria style, and got to watch your steak being broiled over an open flame. The meal was very good and was not too expensive.I found myself stuck in New York by a major snowstorm that hit just before the day I was to fly home. The reservations desk quickly extended my stay by a day , even moving a new reservation to a different room so I would not have to change rooms. All in all, I had a great stay and would book at Doubletree again if I could get a good rate."
164,1791,"Mar 5 2009	Birthday Trip To NYC - Great Location	This hotel is in a great location . After months of looking and having stayed in DBT and Hiltons before I chose this hotel to spend my 65th Birthday with my family. As soon as the booking was made via telephone from UK. The problems started. Wrong charges, wrong allocation of people to rooms. Overchaging of $135. It took lots of emails and calls to US to sort out. So on my arrival I was already wary of what could happen. Then I met Doris on the Frount Desk who was the most patronising person in that role that i have ever met. After lots of sorting out we finally moved rooms the next day and thias was down to Dobrina Carrara AFO Manager showing Customer Care and skills that you would execpt from a chain such as Hilton.The rooms are large and very clean. Beds were bliss, although my daughter had to sleep on sofabed for 5 nights. Breakfast in Gingers was excellent and this was given FOC because of all the problems. All other staff that we came in contact with were very nice.I just wished when boking out that we had had Daniel to book us in. We wre still owed $79 and he sorted that out. He knew his job and more.I would go back if just a couple."
165,1791,"Mar 3 2009 	Clean Modern Rooms Nice Stay	Stayed 2 nights on a Hotwire deal and paid $150pn inc. Check-in painless, suite on 38th floor was nicely refurbished, comfortable sofa bed, nice to have the 2 rooms, good size bathroom, we were expecting 2 double beds but they were just oversized singles (although very comfortable) so we utilised the sofa as well. Great location. As per other reports, we had the same problem with the wireless internet but persisted and it finally worked. I would recommend at the sort of price we paid but wouldn't want to pay rack rate."
166,1791,"Mar 3 2009 	Great Spot For First Time Visit	Stayed 18th Feb - 22 nd Feb . First time in New York , 5 of us , my wife and I plus our 3 sons 20,18,10 . Very central easy walking distance to Central Park , 5th Avenue , Rockerfeller , Macys , Empire State etc . A few steps to the metro for longer trips . Great cookies on arrival and also given to us several other times through our stay , Staff very good and helpful . As it was our sons 18th they upgraded us to the top (43rd ) floor with a great skyline view. Very nice . Good tea/coffee making in room . Microwave and Fridge but no plates /cutlery etc . Breakfast expensive at $25 but we went to the Edison Hotel cafe down the street opposite and paid approx $4-$6 per person , excellent value . Also have a flight confirmation/check in machine in the lobby to check in online and print boarding cards which we did for our return journey with British Airways , I think most other airlines are also included . Had a great stay and would visit again"
167,1791,"Feb 28 2009 	Great for tourists and business travelers	I have been pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Having stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas last week, this is so much better. The room is big enough for a family and confortable enough for the business traveler. I logged right on my laptop without any internet issues at all. Bathroom amenities include a whole selection of Neutragena products! The shower/toilet area is a bit small, but the fabulous room location and views make it a non-issue. Highly recommended."
168,1791,"Feb 28 2009 	This was a gift for the price	I don't think i will ever find this kind of rate in this hotel ever again, we paid a AAA rate of $162.15 and you are right on Times Square! I thought that maybe it was near Times Square but you are right in front of the big screen tv's!! Hotel was excellent, check in around 4:30pm was quick and smooth. The front desk clerk tells you were everything is, the welcome cookies were an awesome detail and they tasted really good. The bar is right in front of the front desk (3rd floor) , liked the chandeliers, they were sort of different. We had the 14th floor facing the side but for the price i could see too much! I imagine that those facing Times Square will probaby cost an arm and a leg...Our room was one king bed and you also have the small living room as you walk in with a sofa bed, desk, tv, a wet bar which under it has a small fridge, a small microwave and a safe. Where the tv was there's one of those expensive snacks and bottles of water that you don't touch unless you really need or have to. The bathroom is nice and very spacious. Room was very nice, clean and comfortable, you have few lamps and another tv. Two entrances to the bathroom, one thru the room and another one thru the living room. Every floor has an ice maker which we used, we always bring sodas and snacks especially when you have kids but on this trip they weren't with us. Overall experience was outstanding. Ended up going to eat to a Cuban restaurant (Havana Central) that was awesome!!! It was just around the corner and it was referred by one of the valet guys when we asked for a Spanish restaurant. There's also a comedy club right next to the restaurant and around the corner from the hotel. Parking was $35.00 plus tip since the car gets parked for you there so paying for valet at the hotel is not necessary if you don't mind walking 2 minutes to the parking garage (that's where they park them anyway) Internet is $9.95 in your room but at the hotel lobby is free, they disconnected my internet before check out time so i had to use it at the lobby. I would recommend the hotel any time and feel welcome to bring kids the only thing is that there is not pool but having Times Square in front of you and couple of tv's i don't think it's so necessary. You could still hear the sirens from the city but not biggie cause i was exhausted when i went to bed. Bed and pillows were sooo nice and comfortable!!!"
169,1791,"Feb 27 2009 	Great for families	We stayed here in June 2008. Two couples and two young kids (2 yo &amp; 9 month old) shared one room and it worked out great. The room was clean and plenty large enough for all of us to feel comfortable. There was an entrance to the bathroom from both the living room and the bedroom which was nice b/c the other couple was up earlier than us and didn't have to disturb us to get into the bathroom.We are not huge fans of the Times Square and prefer a less &quot;touristy&quot; New York experience, but with kids, you can't beat it. It has two separate rooms in the suite, with a door between. And there is plenty to do right outside your door."
170,1791,"Feb 24 2009 	decent hotel experience	I stayed at the Doubletree hotel for a week in february. In general it is a decent place to stay, the room was pretty big ( bedroom + living room), clean, the bathroom also quite big. We booked a room on the 39th floor so the view was also pretty ok. The location was perfect. The only weak point was the service, we have booked a room with the internet, which didn't work at all during the entire week, we were always told to go down to the lobby to use the free wireless. It was pretty disappointing because we payed for the internet already...After many discussions we were offered breakfast instead which was a nice but pretty late gesture though. Also the concierge was a bit weird, we wanted to make reservations in a restaurant and were told to call the restaurant ourselves, after some discussions the concierge allegedly called the restaurant and booked a table but when we showed up at the restaurant they did not have any reservation under our name...(this being a concierge guy...the lady however was really helpful and adorable) Overall it was a good stay, which could have been even better with some minor adjustments. I would recommend the hotel for a NYC trip because the location is just outstanding!"
171,1791,"Feb 20 2009 	amazing location amazing staff amazing hotel!	We recently took my daughter and her friend on a weekend trip to Time Square to celebrate her 16th birthday. It was something she always dreamed of, and the trip was everything we imagined. We drove to New York from Virginia, and it was a nice drive. We never experienced any major traffic issues until we got closer to Time Square but even then it wasn't that bad. (i would do it again) Upon pulling in front of the hotel we were truely welcomed by Vinny. He was so helpful and funny, which made the stress of the traffic not noticeable. He assisted unloading our bags out of the car, and escorted us to the front desk. He was very helpful in explaining everything about the hotel. We did take advantage of the Valet parking, and it was well worth the money. Upon getting checked in, we were helped to our room by a bell boy. We had originally had reserved the queen suite, but at check in was upgraded to the king suite at no additional charge. The room was on the 17th floor and was amazing, although we had a side view from the window it was beautiful. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever!! The teenagers slept on the sofa bed, but slept like angels. The rooms are very comfortable, spacious, and well taken care of. Not only is this a beautiful hotel, it was affordable, and in a great location. Outside your doorway you will find the heart of Time Square, but yet at night you never hear any of the city sounds, and will sleep like a baby. I would recommend taking the bus tour, worth the money to see all of the sites of New York. For someone who has never traveled far from my hometown this was a big adventure. And i have to say it was well worth all the memories we experienced. I look forward to planning another trip to New York and plan on staying at Doubletree Time Square again! Also, dont forget the delicious cookies!"
172,1791,"Jan 29 2009 	Big Clean Excellent for Price	Travelling to NYC with 3 kids and wife in jan/2009. Excellent price to hold 5 people in the room. The room was big (above average for NYC), quiet (we stayed at 6th floor, the lowest one) and clean. It is located in front of the ticket booth in Times Square. If you are in NYC for shows or shopping, this is perfect. Just expect to see a lot of people as you step out of the hotel.The free internet service is available only at the lobby."
173,1791,"Jan 27 2009 	Great Location Great Staff	We just returned from a four day mini vacation at the Doutbletree Suites, Times Square. Good this hotel through company website. Got a great rate. Stayed on the 15th floor very quite. The kids 11 and 9 were greeted by warm cookies. The front desk staff was excellent some of best most helpful customer service I have experienced at a hotel in a long time. The doorman was always pleasant and helpful. This was a two room suite, large bathroom great comfortable beds. TV in living area and one in the bedroom area. The engineering staff was great, the housekeeping staff was great, room cleaned very well every day. They even made sure I had extra coffee. The safe was a nice addition to the room (no charge) We did not eat at the hotel or in Times Square 2 block away at 8th and 9th Ave. had many excellent well priced non chain type places to eat. Close to everything we need to do. The Tour Bus, Subway, Grand Central Station, Rockerfeller Center, TKTS booth right across the street. We have no complaints at all about this hotel. We will return the next time we are in NYC! A great place to stay for families."
174,1791,"Jan 24 2009 	Major problem with lack of internet access in rooms	Nice hotel but serious disadvantage was wireless that did not work in the rooms. They disabled the internet connections in the room and yet the wireless network was terrible. It took over 10 minutes just to pull up one page in the rooms. I was on the phone with the help desk extensively but still no improvement even after they reset the wireless on the floor. We had two computers and both had the same problem. We finally went down to the business center and were able to access the internet. However, we stayed for several days and needed the internet connection in our room. We found several business people in the business center complaining about the problems with wireless access in their room. They should either put the internet connection lines back in the rooms or fix their wireless network. Otherwise, this hotel does not work for anyone needing internet access."
175,1791,"Jan 22 2009 	Excellent Trip	Rooms are very nicely decorated and very clean and large. Actually, this is 2 rooms since this is a suite. Bathroom is large and had entry from both rooms. Flat screen TV's in both rooms. Fridge and microwave in sitting room. Wolfgang Puck coffee maker in room. Although in Times Square, right in the middle of everything, we found the rooms to be very quiet. Rates are really good for NYC.The people that worked there were very pleasant. We went to a play on Broadway and only had to walk 2 blocks. Never used the restaurant in the hotel but we used the gym which was also very clean and up to date.We were very comfortable there and would go back again."
176,1791,"Jan 21 2009 	Good experience	We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square from January 17-19 (MLK weekend). Our first confusion was finding out where to park. We called the hotel from the car and ended up valeting right in front of the hotel on Broadway. When we checked out, we went and got our car from the lot on 47th ourselves and saved $10 per night in parking charges. Check in was a breeze, very personable (especially for NYC!). We had a king premium room on the 39th floor for only $186 per night (AAA through the hotel website - they did not check my card). We loved the location, though be warned it is right in the heart of Times Square which, on the weekends, is a bit crazy! The room was great - plenty of room, comfortable beds, including the pull out. We could not figure out how to get the small refrigerator to work, but everything else was in good shape - obviously recently renovated. There are 2 flat screen TVs. Note that the kitchenette (really just a mini-fridge and microwave) has no utensils or plates, so pick up your own."
177,1791,"Jan 19 2009 	Good value quality hotel	As per many trip reports we found this hotel very adequate. We drove in to NYC and drove up to the door to be greeted by the valet, dropped our cases off before dropping the car off down a few blocks.The reception is a bit odd in terms of layout and we found check in very slow, although staff were pleasant and helpful. The cookies were very nice on arrival.We were on the 24th floor and enjoyed comp wifi access. The suites were large with flatscreens, decent size lounge. The rooms were clean and functional. Shower not very powerful.Didnt eat in the hotel but had a look in, didnt look very glamoros with no windows and musical theme, cannot comment on the standard of food.Seems they are renovating on the 3rd floor near the business suite. We printed from the room and went to the suite but it was very clear how to pull the print job. However, we called the hotline from within the business suite and they assisted straight away.Security on the door checked our key cards after a certain time at night. They were also very helpful calling cabs.On the whole I would recommend this hotel for a first time visitor, a fantastic location to walk to most sights."
178,1791,"Jan 17 2009 	Fantastic	We stayed at the Doubletree hotel in Times Square for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it is FANTASTIC!!!! the location is out of the world and the rooms of the hotel are gorgeous the beds are HUGE!!!! the bath room has to two doors into it, it is that big one into the lounge area and 1 into the bedroom. It really is great hotel with a superb location, and the view from the room is great looking over Times square at night with all the lights on really is something!We went up the Empire State Building which was an experience took us 3 and half hours to get up but it something you have got to do, you are there so you have got to go up it really is fantastic!The shopping on 5th Avenue is great, everything is just overtop and bloomingdales the sweets and chocolate floor in their is just like wow oh my gosh! I would DEFO recommend this hotel you cant beat the location it is just fantastic!!!!!!!"
179,1791,"Jan 14 2009 	Good location	Stayed on the 41st floor and it was very quiet. Could not hear the street noise at all.Likes:Complimentary internet 'cos of Gold Hilton Honors MembershipLarge room with sofa bedMini fridge and microwaveWarm cookies every eveningNear subway (47 St Subway - N,R,W line)Right in the heart of Times Square!Dislikes:Lousy breakfast policy - all members in the room should get the free breakfast, especially if we are Gold Hilton Honors Members. How silly if there are 4 members in the room and only 2 get the free breakfasts?!? I think Doubletree need to rethink their breakfast policy.Lousy service in the restaurant - understaffed"
180,1791,"Jan 8 2009 	Absolute bargain	Whether you like this hotel or not I guess depends on how much you pay. We got an upper floor one bedroom suite for just over $200 and I have to say it was an absolute bargain. It's a great location, right in Times Square where the subway lines all interconnect so you can go anywhere from outside the door. Our suite on the 29th floor overlooked the side street and though we could see some of the lights of Times Square it was incredibly quiet. No street noise at all. The bell boys in the street level lobby were really helpful. We got three seriously yummy warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. The room was great for us and our two kids (aged 4 and 2) - the lounge had a pull-out sofa and the hotel supplied a cot (crib) for the little one. The bathroom was functional rather than glamorous and the shower was more of a drip than a downpour, but there was plenty of counter space and nice neutrogena toiletries. There was a door into the bathroom from both the bedroom and the lounge. Both rooms had flat screen TVs and there were real coathangers with hooks in the wardrobe. The bed was big and comfy with lots of pillows. When we checked out with our vast quantities of luggage the bell boys were helpful in getting us an oversize taxi. Quite frankly at the price we paid, what's not to like?"
181,1791,"Jan 6 2009	Great location very nice hotel post-remodel	Ive stayed at this hotel a few times for business and leisure and generally keep coming back for 1) the location and 2) the reasonably priced rates. Its a good combination for doing tourist (or in my case, business) activities and generally the rates are in the $200-$250 per room/night range which is quite reasonable given that every room is a suite. I am a Hilton Diamond member so get free breakfast and an upgrade of sorts, which are welcomed perks. Its nice that the lobby is above the ground floor as you dont need to worry about it being too crowded. Overall Id recommend it as my hotel of choice in the Times Square area, especially if traveling with 3-4 friends or family members, due the extra space."
182,1791,"Jan 6 2009 	Nice Suite and Great Service	A suite was one of our requirements. This fits the bill. Our hours aren't always the same so it was a plus to be able to shut the bedroom door and watch TV without waking my wife.The service from everyone we encountered was very good. Hanna at the restaurant, Alex at the bar, AJ at the concierge desk, all the people at the reception desk, the maid for our room, and the two maintenance men that adjusted the temperature on our fridge were all outstanding.No request went unanswered! No problem ignored.We were there Dec 17-22, '08 to celebrate our 38th anniversary and just booked June 14-20, '09 to celebrate my wife's birthday."
183,1791,"Jan 6 2009	Great Hotel for Family Visit--Book A Conference Suite	We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square starting new years day and had a great time.We have a family of 6 (4 kids) and had no problem fitting into the conference suite (bring sleeping bags for more than 2 kids.) There are two rooms and a large conference table that seats 6. It is a true suite since there is a door to the bedroom with a separate door from bedroom into the bathroom. We were on the 38th floor with an amazing view of Times Square. At $220/night it was a great deal for NYC. One night we just had 6 guests and takeout and ate in the suite at the conference table.I agree with other reviewers that the lobby is less than desirable, but who cares? Just outside the door are dozens of restaurants, bars, etc. that would charge less anyway for a drink. The location, while great is a nightmare if you arrive by car. Don't drive if you can avoid it, and if you do, don't arrive at night when people are going to the theaters. It took almost a hour to travel the last few blocks to the hotel. Also avoid Bond 45 restaurant on 45th Street unless you want a very mediocre meal for $$$$."
184,1791,"Jan 3 2009	Misleading	We stayed at the doubletree from Dec. 26th - Jan.2 and it was not what we were expecting at all... First off we booked this stay on these specific dates because that's what date their website claimed there new lobby would finally be finished. Not only was it not finished, but the carpet was totally tore up and there was very loud drilling going on for the first 3 days we were there. It honestly looked like a construction zone. Not to mention that even when it does get finished its a VERY small lobby and you often find yourself trying to fight through people to get to the elevator. 2 out of the 3 times i ordered room service it was cold and didn't taste good at all. The one good thing i had was an outstanding pizza that might have been top 5 I've ever had in my life.Oh and if you want any soda's or anything like that you have to get them from the mini-bar because the entire hotel does not have 1 vending machine! You heard me right, not one! One can of coke costs $3.75, and if you don't feel like fighting the thousands of people on times square to get a coke then the mini-bar is your only option... Also the maid service had to be reminded dailey that the mini-bar needed re-stocked otherwise they didn't do it. Very annoying...The shower heads are pathetic. A normal shower that would usually take me 10 minuets took me at least 25. And its goes from boiling hot to ice cold without even adjusting the temperature.There were other little things here and there that happened to make me write this poor review but ill just leave it at what i wrote.One amazing thing about the hotel though is the beds!! I have never slept so good in my life. In Fact i slept so good on this bed i ordered one the day i got home from doubletree's website where you can purchase all beds and furniture the hotel uses.http://www.doubletreeathome.com/The security guard Brian downstairs was one of the nicest guy's you will ever meet. We would have been completely lost without him and we even wrote a letter to management about what a great job he did."
185,1791,"Jan 1 2009 	OK stay	We just returned after a 5 night stay at Doubletree Times Square.We found that the website phots are misleading. The lobby looks absolutely nothing like the pics. Albeit they were working in the lobby but I still don't see it looking anything like the pics posted. We arrived early and was allowed to check-in around 12:00. When we asked for a room with a view we were told they didn't exist for the double rooms. I've since found that to be untrue.The furnishings in the rooms were not the greatest for the amount we paid per night. $657.00.I have stayed in much smaller and less clean places in NYC but would stay in the MIlford Plaza over the Doubletree next time.It's just as nice and less $ if you don't mind not being right on the square.I also didn't know anything about breakfast coupons until I read an eariler post. As a Hilton member, I feel I should have been told this. The cost at $25.00 per breakfast became alot of $ for 4 people.We go to NYC every Dec. but am not so sure I'll stay here again. The location is awesome though. I couldn't ask for a better one.Also, Shannon, one of the conceirge staff, as exceptionally friendly and helpful."
186,1791,"Jan 1 2009 	Great suite right in the heart of Times Square	Spent a hectic 36 hours sightseeing in New York with the family whilst visiting the States and used the Guest Suites as a base for our Big Apple stay.We hade one suite with two rooms which was plenty for the five of us. Didn't use many of the hotel facilities and lobby was being refurbished whilst we were there but the rooms were good, great comfy beds and the location in Times Square was fantastic.Took in Central Park, Bloomingdales, FAO Schwartz, The Rockefeller (better views than Empire State), a Knicks game, Staten Island ferry, Wall Street, Century 21 etc whilst there - all with a good nights sleep at the guest suites.Don't miss the hot cookie on arrival!"
187,1791,"Jan 1 2009 	Unbelievable room in an unbelievable location!	My wife and I were booked into a room at this hotel by our cousin, for one night the Saturday before Christmas. What a room! It was a suite with an incredible view out the window, looking down onto TImes Square. The staff was friendly, efficient and top-notch, which was especially appreciated because we arrived late in the day and the lobby was under construction (in the midst of a huge renovation), conditions that usually lead to a long wait in line and abrupt service. In this case, however, everything was perfect."
188,1791,"Dec 31 2008 	Doubletree Times Square Great Location	I've stayed here twicw with my wife. The location is perfect for shows, walking distance to attractions, etc."
189,1791,"Dec 31 2008 	A Great Place to Stay	Our family of 5 stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square November 21st - 25th and loved it. The room accomodated the 5 of us perfectly, and we loved the location. Our kids were visiting New York for the first time and the Times Square location really wowed them. We liked the central location and walked most everywhere. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms were suprisingly quiet. Would highly recommend staying here, we felt like it was a good value for the money."
190,1791,"Dec 29 2008 	Perfect location	Just returned from a one night stay at the Doubletree to see a show and NYC at Christmas. We were able to check in early and given a room that overlooked the M&amp;Ms store, my son's favorite place. We were a 15 minute walk to everything we wanted to do. Yes, the crowds are hard to navigate when you exit the hotel, especially when the theaters are starting and letting out, but that's the fun of Times Square, you just go with the flow! The lobby construction looks almost to be done, but it wasn't an inconvenience at all. The rooms are huge compared to NYC standards, separate bedroom, living room, big bathroom and wet bar in the living room. We will be staying at this hotel whenever we return, it's great for families. Also, if you are traveling with children, Mars 2112 is a really fun place to go to dinner. The food is so, so but the whole experience is &quot;out of this world.&quot;"
191,1791,"Dec 28 2008 	This was a great birthday Treat!	I booked this through &quot;cheaptickets.com&quot;. What a perfect location! I was in NYC to celebrate my birthday with friends (nov 14). I booked it the day before my birthday for less than $200 including tax!It faced the lights of Times Square which made me so happy I booked there. I really felt like I was in the middle of it all when I looked out the window. The room was HUGE for NY. Two rooms, one queen bed, one pullout couch and a bathroom which was bigger than the one I have at home!2 TV s and a mini-bar.Wow, what a good deal for the money.Granted it is not a 5-star hotel, but I really considered this a &quot;score&quot; for the money - and it was just a couple blocks from Winter Garden theater where I saw Mama Mia! Caroline's comedy club was next to the theater so I had a really nice birthday.Having the weather be 60 degrees was a bonus, but I can't guarantee that for you.I can say the hotel was great - also allowed late check-out."
192,1791,Dec 25 2008 	Loved the Doubletree Times Square	I booked a Hilton Honors stay at the Doubletree Times Square for Dec 13-17 and was pleasantly surprised! After reading some reviews on check in and potential rude employees I was a little concerned. No need to worry and this place is in the middle of everything you need to get to. Having never been to New York we found it very easy to navigate to our broadway shows and pick up the tour bus across the street.Also if you are an Hilton Honors member you receive 2 breakfast copupons for each night of your stay. At $25 per breakfast that definitely helps out. If we visit New York again I wouldn't hesitate to book at this Doubletree again.
193,1791,"Dec 21 2008 	Great Choice	We stayed at the hotel from Dec 12-14 using Hilton Honors points. We arrived from Los Angeles at 7 AM and were very pleasantly surprised when they allowed us to check in early. We were given room 1202 which faced Times Square. We were very happy to get a room facing all the lights and sights of Broadway right beneath us.There were 3 of us staying so it really came in handy to have the suite with the family room and the pull out sofa. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable and I was told that the sofabed was also comfortable. We also liked having a microwave and a fridge in the room for drinks and leftovers.We were somewhat low in the hotel on the 12th floor since I believe the hotel has 40+ floors but the noise below was manageable. We didn't have any problems sleeping. The heater in the room wasn't the type to set by degree and was tricky to find a medium between warm enough and too hot but once we did it was fine. The location of the hotel is the main reason why we chose this hotel and we were not disappointed. It is right across from the TKTS center and we used it one afternoon to get tickets. We saw a couple Brodway shows and it only took 5 minutes to walk to either of them because of the centralized location. We spent the remainder of our trip at a hotel a few blocks east and missed the location at Times Square. There is a subway entrance right beneath the hotel that we took downtown and the location is great because there is so much within walking distance including Rockefeller Center, Central Park, 5th Ave, and more. I was worried about the hotel lobby being renovated before the trip but it was no problem at all. You need to take an elevator from the ground floor to the lobby on the 3rd floor but it was no problem at all and added an extra sense of security. Overall we really enjoyed this hotel and location and when we come back to NYC we will stay here again. It's a great place."
194,1791,"Dec 21 2008 	Perfect Times Square location	We are just finishing a one night stay at this hotel, which is the ultimate central location if you are visiting Times Square and the theatre distric. Hotels are booked and rates are up in this week before Christmas, but we scored a suite with two queen beds and a big pullout sofa in the living room for $332 including all taxes etc. The accomodations are much bigger, better and more comfortable than anything we have experienced in NYC in that price range. We would return here in a minute!"
195,1791,"Dec 17 2008 	Great location and everything else!	Although I prefer more exclusive properties, we decided to save a bit and go with Doubletree suite. We booked with Expedia and, upon arrival, got a free upgrade which was lovely. Location is simply great! Great, great, great! We walked all over the place but it was quite cold so often hurried back to relax and warm up. The room was very clean although the rest of the hotel was not kept as good but I do not expect that in such a huge place. Everything was in order in our room and the bed was perfect. Will probably stay there again - I am just too afraid of all those tiny rooms everyone is talking about when talking about NY hotels."
196,1791,"Dec 15 2008 	Very pleased with Doubletree!	My wife and I stayed two nights in December and were very pleased with the entire stay. I asked for a high, quiet room and was booked on the 41st floor at the end of the hall-perfect! The rooms are true two room suites and are very clean. Could be considered slightly dated, but not enough to be a concern-especially at the price.This hotel is in an ideal location for Times Square and the lower part of mid-town. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and seemed interested in our satisfaction. We would definitely return.By the way, the lobby renovation was not bothersome in the least."
197,1791,"Dec 10 2008 	Great location that's about it	The location is the best thing this property has to offer. We were aware of the lobby renovation prior to arrival so we expected that, not a big deal. We preordered a pack and play for the baby, when we checked in they assured us it was already in the room. When we got to the room (1:00 PM) it was not there. We called down they said they would bring it right up. By 5 Pm we still had not received it, called down to the front desk they told us it would be right up. We stopped by the front desk at 7PM because we still had not gotten it, they said it would be sent right up. At 9PM I went back down to the front desk and and told them we preordered it had been told several times it would be right up and that currently we had a 4 month old baby sleeping on the floor. Not once did anyone say they were sorry we had not received it. It was delivered about 5 minutes later by a very pissed employee. Every time we left the room and came back the keys did not work. Every single time. Which meant we had to go back down stairs to the front desk and wait in line to get new keys. We did not encounter one employee who smiled, not one. For the price we paid for our hotel room $509.00 plus tax fro 2 nights.)you would think they would be more accommodating."
198,1791,"Dec 6 2008 	Spacious rooms in the heart of Times Square	When the hotel says they are right in the middle of Times Square, they aren't kidding. This makes everything you could possibly need well within a short walk, be it shopping, dining, or sightseeing.The rooms at this property are true suites; not the mini-suites you find at something like a Springhill Suites. The living room is significantly larger than the bedroom, and I found myself watching the plasma screen TV in that room and reserving the bedroom for sleep. The bathroom has an entrance just inside the front door to the room, and as you walk through the large bathroom, you can exit through another door into the bedroom. There is a small bar area in the suite...perfect if you are entertaining, though I didn't find it particularly useful. I did come in late, so the well-stocked mini-bar provided the usual snacks to take the edge off my hunger until breakfast the next morning.My review is only average because there is a lot of construction going on. Breakfast takes place in a big meeting room that can get loud as it fills up. The decor is a little dated, and the heating in the suite is a wall heater that has dual vents to share the heat between the two rooms; so one room is usually hotter than the other.Altogether though, this hotel usually has the best rates in this part of NYC, and is more than adequate for the business traveler."
199,1791,"Dec 5 2008 	Spacious Rooms 	We spent Nov 21 - 24 at the Doubletree and would love to return on our next trip. On the day of arrival, we called early in the morning to request an early check-in and a room on a high floor if possible. When we arrived around 2 PM, our room was not quite ready so we had the hotel hold our luggage (complimentary). The staff at the baggage storage desk were excellent. They helped tag and secure our language all the while smiling and with great patience. Despite the bustle of the hotel, I felt reassured that our luggage was safe and well taken care of. At check-in, we received chocolate chip cookies with warm and gooey centers. Just how I like them! We had room 1504 and upon arrival were impressed with how clean and comfy everything looked. Our 2-room suite (one bedroom + one living room) was a luxurious amount of space for 4 adults in NYC. Two slept on the king bed and 2 more on the pull-out couch. There was also a fridge, microwave, and mini-bar -- which we promptly locked after reading that the bar could be &quot;touchy&quot; and accidentally charge you for items that you bumped. I appreciated having a 2nd sink in the living room area for drinking water. Also - the in-room coffee was surprisingly tasty. The bathroom had 2 separate entrances so you could enter either from the living room or bedroom. Our room had a partial view of Times Square but the amazing thing was that the room was INCREDIBLY QUIET, and we are light sleepers. Don't worry - blackout curtains easily hid the blinking and sometimes blinding lights of Times Square. I also liked that I could crack open a window if I wanted some fresh air, since most hotel windows are sealed tight. As for the lobby construction, there was zero noise and inconvenience, aside from the ladders and workers being in the lobby. The location of the hotel is great. It's close to a subway stop; TKTS booth across the street, and an array of restaurants within walking distance. Having never stayed in the heart of Times Sq, it was a different experience being in such a busy area. You walk out of the revolving door and it's a continuous stream of people walking either direction.Overall, this was a fabulous hotel for the $183 per night price we paid from Hotwire. The amount of space and location were phenomenal features, and I would highly recommend the DoubleTree!"
200,1791,"Dec 1 2008 	Great Location	We stayed at the Doubletree on times square for the second time in a year. The location cannot be beat, its right across the street from the TKTS outlet. and right in the heart of the theater district. The rooms are nothing to write home about. They are clean, roomy for 4 people, they have a microwave and small fridge that never got cold, and is equipped with a bedroom, bathroom and seperate small living room with a pull out bed, but the hotel itself is okay. they are going through some kind of renovation at this time the lobby area is sort of a mess, the hallways look like you are in a 2 star hotel, not at all like a Hilton, Hyatt or similar. but you come to NY or enjoy the city not the hotel. So all i'd like to say is the location can't be beat and the subway is across the street or right under the hotel depending if you are going uptown or downtown. Loved the city and the sites, hotel is also very acceptable."
201,1791,"Nov 24 2008 	Conference Suites are Great	We stayed in one of the xx03 conference suites and had a dinner party with 11 people. It was perfect. There are two differenct conference suites. The 03 suites and the 01 suites. The 03 suites are bigger and have more windows that face north and west. They also have 2 full bathrooms with tub and showers (one off of the living room). You get a great view up 7th Ave and can see Central Park and when you look out the west facing windows you see the northern half of Times Square. The 01 suites face south and west and are smaller because they wrap arround one of the elevator shafts and only have 1 bathroom and not as many windows. However the south and west windows let you see all of Times Square. If a view of all of Times Square is top priority than go for the 01 suite. Some of the photos on the Tripadvisor web site are taken from one of the 01 suites. If space is a top priority (plus a second full bathroom) go with the 03 suite--the pictures on the hotel web site are the 03 suite. We have a lot of family in the area and decided to rent the conference suite because it has a table that seats 8 and thought it would be nice to invite family and order room service. Eventually we had 11 but the room has a second table in the bedroom on wheels that fits under the desk so we pulled this out and put it at the end of the conference table. The room service people were great and brought up extra chairs and tablecloths. We ran out and got our own appetizers and wine and beer because the room also has a refrigerator (small but held a lot of beer and cheese and dip), sink, and microwave. Family came at 6 and had appetizers in the living room (a little crowded for 11 but not uncomfortable) and then dinner at 7 in the dining room. Room service came right on time and the food was very good for room service in a hotel--steak, Mahi-Mahi, Salmon, a very large choice for a room service menu. They also have a separate catering department if we had wanted to go that route. What we look for in a hotel is a lot of space in the room. We have also stayed in the regular suites and they are quite comfortable but do not have a dining room table. Our family had a great time because there was no time rush like at most NYC restaurants and we could be as loud as we wanted--the rooms are well soundproofed in this hotel. After dinner some people stayed at the table and some went into the living room and turned on the TV. Very relaxing for dinner in NYC.We aren't the types that like to be fussed over at hotels so the fact that this hotel has a small lobby that was undergoing repairs didn't bother us. If lobby appearance is important to you this hotel isn't for you. The furniture in the room is very nice but not elegant (kind of like our home) which is great if you are bringing children. This was a great stay and the staff did a great job. Will have another dinner party again here sometime in the future. For what we wanted it was perfect. If you want an impressive lobby and elegant furniture this is not the place for you."
202,1791,"Nov 22 2008 	Good Stay	I stayed at the Doubletree from November 11th through the 16th. My room was on the 22nd floor. It was extremely convenient to everything. I travel to NYC about twice a year to see theatre and I usually hunt for a good rate for a decent hotel. My favorite hotel used to be the Rhiga Royal, until it was bought out and swanked out of my price bracket to the NYC London. In July, I stayed at the Dream Hotel, which was trendy, but I got a super cheap rate, and didn't mind the small room. But, I digress.The Double Tree is a great location and tons of room. I loved having the separate living area, as I have friends who I meet up with and it's great having our own living area to chat, instead of in a hotel bar, restaurant, etc. The bedroom section was very comfortable. The bathroom was a little bit dated, but it was in fine working condition so it was no big deal that it didn't have the super deluxe new look...It also doesn't have the price tag associated with that look, either.I found having an empty refrigerator, instead of a mini-bar a blessing. I loaded up on my favorite beverages for my stay.The maid service was very attentive and always prompt with my requests. I frequently asked for more coffee and condiment packets with my room cleaning, and I always came back to a clean room and plenty of coffee to make for me and my friends.The location can not be beat for seeing the Theatre. Almost everything is within a 5 to 10 minute walk, except for Lincoln Center, which is a bit of a hike- about 20-25 minutes walk.The hotel lobby was still under construction, but aside from a few congested periods during my stay, it was barely an issue.So, the bottom line- would I stay here again?Absolutely, as long as the price is what I consider to be reasonable for NYC. I paid around $320 per night for a 2 room suite- which I consider high value, indeed. Of course, the economic downturn could be a part of why the room was so cheap, but It was a great deal.I never used their restaurants or room service. With some of my favorite restaurants nearby, why should I? Part of the excitement of NYC is the great choice of restaurants!"
203,1791,"Nov 18 2008	Heart of TImes Square!	Fabulous location and great for families. This 2-room suite was perfect for our family of 5. You enter from the livingroom which was nicely decorated and had a pull out queen sofa sleeper, large wall to wall window to view Times Square below. A large counter area with a small regriderator, micrwave and small sink and a small table to have meals. A small but adequate bathroom led the way towards the bedroom which had 2 queen beds, a large armoire with 32 in tv, large window to view Times Square and nicele decorated as well. The lobby was on something liike the 10th floor and check-in went well. There is little room out front of the busy hotel to park to check in so we had to circle block to unload our bags from the car. We came in from Long Island and after checking in, dropped the car at the rental as you do NOT need or want to drive in the city. Public transportation and walking is your best bet!!Lots to see and do. You can not do it all in just a few days so don't try to. Read up and pick your favorites...we were here for only 5 days and chose: Double decker bus tour, kids loved riding up top, New York Yankees game, Lion King musical, free ferry ride to Staten Island (which goes by the Statue of Liberty) walking tour of Times Square, NBC studios, beautiful old cathedrals/churches, street performers, great food and night life! The city that never sleeps!"
204,1791,"Nov 17 2008 	What I expected	I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites for one night with my two kids ages 7 and 9. The hotel was exactly what I expected it to be -a big hotel chain, larger sized rooms, busy Times Square location and clean ( minus a few hairs in the shower). The room consists of two rooms - one has a pullout sofa and the other has two beds. My 7 year old slept on the sofabed, I slept on one bed and my 9 year old slept in the other bed. I was traveling without my husband which was a good thing because the beds are not that big although they are comfortable. The location is 47th and 7th just on the outskirts of Time Square. You step out of the hotel and there are people everywhere and lights, lights, lights! Our room faced the back and was quiet of street noise but the walls are a little thin and the person next door was blasting the tv and I could hear it perfectly. I am very familiar with NYC and I picked this location mainly because I was traveling alone with the kids and we were going to see a show and I wanted a short walk back to the hotel. It was literally two blocks from our theater. If you are looking for a high end hotel this is not it. If you want a comfortable, spacious, reliable chain hotel in the theater district, its a good choice."
205,1791,"Nov 15 2008	Perfect place for ladies shopping 	A group of 14 women stayed here on our recent trip to NYC. It was a wonderful place to stay! You can fit 5 adults in a suite. There are 2 sinks in the bathroom and one at the bar area. There is a separate fridge from the minibar. We all enjoyed the free cookies at check in, but even better was the service from everyone. Rhonda at the front desk was awesome! She was so patient getting all of us into rooms together (2 adjoining) and all so quickly. The bellmen even came up to weigh our luggage so that we would know what to take out before checking in at the airport! The lobby is under renovation, but no matter. The location could not be better nor the service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! I plan to return. It was clean, safe, comfortable, and affordable."
206,1791,Nov 13 2008	No Surprises	No surprises. It's exactly like every Doubletree out there. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Its right in the middle of Times Square so for those that prefer that locale this would be a good option.for those that enjoy an authentic experince go to Queens and have a pint in one of the last few remaining Irish bars in Woodside
207,1791,"Oct 31 2008 	Definitely stay here again	We stayed at this hotel Oct. 19th to 24th, we are 4 Irish ladies who went on a shopping trip.We booked a &quot;2 doubles 2 room suite&quot; and we had plenty of space (believe me we had lots of bags), but never felt like we were tripping over each other.There are 3 sinks and loads of mirror space, so no problems getting ready.Its smack bang in the middle of Times Square but we couldnt hear ANY noise from our room and the drapes must be blackout because it was so dark at night and the beds were comfortable so a good nights sleep was had by all (this is not always easy in NY). Other hotels we've stayed in had a lot of traffic noise. We were there during the renovations but it didnt inconvenience us in any way and we didnt hear noise from that either (yes it looks a bit unsightly but we dont spend much time hanging around lobbies, there's too much else to be doing! and we never encountered any queues at the desk) Front desk staff are really friendly and oh those cookies...! We didnt go to the bar/restaurant because why would you? there's so much on your doorstep..we saved a fortune in taxi fares because it's so central. The &quot;Evergreen&quot; diner around the corner is good for breakfast ($10 will get you breakfast and its served late, maybe all day). We will definitely be back to this hotel, in fact we've checked rates already for next year! the rates are so good at the moment for what you get. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend it....!"
208,1791,"Oct 29 2008 	Liked this Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my husband in Oct 2005. Located on Times Square, it was like living in two worlds - outside it was like being in a madhouse, inside it was peaceful and clean. I am returning to the same hotel in November 2008 with my Mother as I know my way around from that point and know exactly how to find things without too much stress....it IS completely mad outside, but inside its like breathing a sigh of relief. Not the absolute best hotel I have ever stayed in, but very good for the money."
209,1791,"Oct 26 2008 	Great Stay	Four of us booked our 4 night stay (Oct 21-25) in NY at the Doubletree Suites Times Square and then I read a couple of reviews and got concerned. However, we had a terrific stay. Our room was on the 42nd floor with a great view south. The only time we heard any noise was when we opened the windows. The beds were really comfortable- as were the pillows. The huge counter in the bathroom plus the mirror/sink /counter in the living room really worked for our group of 4. It was very clean.We called up for more coffee on our first morning and it was at the door within 3 minutes. Followed by a phone call from the front desk asking if we had received it yet. GREAT SERVICE. The concierge helped us with show ticket info on several occasions.The location really can't be beat. We arrived from the airport at 6:15pm- checked in- dumped our luggage in our room, went across the street and bought half price tickets to a show and were in our seats at the theater by 7pm. So that lovely warm chocolate chip cookie they give you on checkin was a life saver as we didn't get to eat until much later.Although the lobby is under construction right now- it wasn't a problem at all.We will definitely stay there again."
210,1791,"Oct 25 2008 	Great (and quiet) view of Times Square	Excellent one night stay in October. On the 17th Floor with a view of Times Square. All the lights, signs, and people, but none of the noise. I was absolutely amazed at how quiet and dark the room was when we closed the curtains for bed. Room was nice - bed, bath, and living room with wet bar. Bed was very comfortable, but the linens were not fantastic. One note of caution: they are doing construction in the lobby and when we were there, it looked like a disaster area. You walk straight into a set of scaffolding when the elevator opens into the lobby and there are sheets of black cloth covers the walls by the room elevators. Turned out this didn't impact our short stay, but it was pretty jarring as our first exposure to the hotel."
211,1791,"Oct 24 2008 	Best NYC Hotel!!!	IF YOU ARE GOING TO NYC  STAY AT THE TIMES SQUARE DOUBLETREE!!I am an extremely frequent traveler, and stay at hotels across the world (approx 7 nights a month). I was lucky enough to retire early, and travel mostly for pleasure. That said, I am always looking to get the most bang for my bucks! Honestly, this is one of the best hotels Ive stayed at, and there are three very specific reasons why+1 The Service was amazing. As soon as I stepped out of my Taxi (NY taxi ride is an experience to say the least) I was greeted by a doorman that managed to make me feel welcome and special. Not only was he friendly, professional, and helpful, his unique New York approach/feel was unforgettable. I entered the hotel and felt extra safe by the 2 level lobby and 24 hour security guard stationed before the elevator. (Please read remarks below about the lobby renovation) My check in was a perfect 10. The front desk staff understood my needs, and recommended the perfect suite for me. I had read a lot of reviews (as usual) and wanted to make sure I got the perfect room. All of them were great. Between the front desk and the concierge, I feel like I really understood what I was getting into and was able to plan the best possible trip. From that point on, everyone I encountered, whether I was riding the elevators or having a snack in restaurant was really [genuinely] friendly and helpful. I really felt like they were happy to go out of their way and help with whatever I needed. +2 Physically, the space I had in the suite was quite literally twice as large as other NYC hotels for the same price. Let me say that again, you get a full bed room AND a full living room for the same price that most other nyc hotels charge for just the bedroom. This was absolutely amazing! I cant believe that all these years I have been staying in the trendy closets some of hotels call rooms!!+3 Location Location Location!!! Right across from the half price broadway ticket both, the Doubletree is in the best location at the heart of nyc!-1 The only negative is that while I stayed the hotel was under renovations in the lobbys and restaurant. This meant that the lobby did not really have any place to sit. The restaurant was fully functioning. To be honest, this did not really bother me too much as I was out all day anyway In the suite, I could not hear or sense the renovation at all! The pictures of the new lobby look great, and I am looking forward to seeing it done!!!*** Overall, this hotel is truly a steal. Enjoy your visit, and make sure you stop by the front desk (aside for check in). The agents are awesome!! And a warm cookie is never far behind their great recommendations and their warm smile!"
212,1791,Oct 13 2008 	Terrible Customer Service overwhelms nice rooms	If you like Times Square and want a 2-room suite this hotel should have a lot to offer.I certainly hoped so. But after 3 nights the terrible way they run the property has overwhelmed any nice feelings I ever had about it.I think it is one of these cases where the staff has learnt to have enormous contempt for their customers and it shows. I suspect that this must come from the management down. It manifested itself from the rude and off-hand way that we were greeted at the check-in desk.To the arbritrary and odd way they decided to cancel our room service order as they were too busy and not tell us about it keeping us waiting in our room for 2 hours. PS Also watch out. We were billed for two items from the minibar even though we did not open it.
213,1791,"Oct 10 2008 	Great Experience!	Two girlfriends and I just returned from a three day trip to NYC. We stayed at the Doubletree, and our experience couldn't have been better. We arrived early but were allowed to check in and go to our room. The hotel lobby is under construction, but we had no problems at all. The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 42nd floor (no special request or extra charge), and it was perfect for three women traveling together; we had two double beds in the bedroom and the pull-out sofa in the living room, plus three sinks. We heard no noise at all, and had no problems with our beds; they were extremely comfortable. We flew in and out of LaGuardia and had no problems with the doormen trying to get us to take a car instead of a taxi to the airport. The location of this hotel is perfect for Broadway shows and shopping. We are planning on staying here during future visits to NYC."
214,1791,"Oct 7 2008 	Bed bugs as well . They told us same thing never had them before	Woke up aftr the first night and legs had welts on them, Found it odd, Next night found same problem, Called housekeeping they brought another matress for the pull out in our Suite. The last night OMG it was AWFUL , The bed was full of remnants fromt he bed bugs I called housekeeping, the one girl said she was sorry that the mattress they pulled from storage had not been preserved, She said she would tell her supervisor of our problem, The supervisor came later and said they have never had bed bugs and that it was just lint BS I took pictures of everything with a copy of that days newspaper etc, THey said we will deduct the breakfast from your bill, I said no that does not make up for what i endured, She said that is all we can do, Well I still have a bottle with those bug carcasses that i took pictures of, and I will be sending them in . But now i find out another family had the same problem and they were also todl this was the first time, I emailed them and they said the response the management posted to their complaint was PURE RUBBISH. She said one occurance was forgivable But two was not. And the second stay she kept the bug in a glass and they tried to tell her it was a beetle, They said NO WAY. So if anyone else had to endure this problem with the doubtree on Brodway in NYC please come forward. I do not feel I or anyone else should be paying their prices for a bed bug ridden Suite. The location was great and had it not been for the bed bugs it would of been well worth it, But it took two weeks to get rid of the welts on my body plus all the discomfort,, Don't let them lie to you or ruin your Stay In the BIG APPLE"
215,1791,"Oct 7 2008 	A pleasant experience despite misgivings	This was my 3rd trip to NYC in three years. The first trip we stayed at the Milford Plaza - nice, central location but very noisy at night and the room was tiny. Our next trip (in May 2008) I chose the Courtyard by Marriott - Midtown east. Excellent hotel, in a quiet business district about 7-8 blocks from Times Square. I was planning to stay there again because i feared the noise in Times Square but at the last moment checked rates and switched to the Doubletree because I didn't want to hear our teenager complain about the walking (LOL). Also, the Doubletree's rates were about $200 less for the whole trip (3 nights) than the Courtyard.The first requirement for us is a king size bed with a pull out sofa for our teenage son. The Courtyard has this as does the DoubleTree. Many hotel rooms in NYC are small, old and cramped. We got a two-room suite at the Doubletree for $300 a night. It was perfect!The rooms were very modern, large and clean. Down pillows, a refrigerator, microwave, granite counter tops, flat screen TVs. We lacked for nothing.My second requirement is that the room be quiet. In all the large cities I have visited traffic noise at night has kept me up. We've also experienced this in Rome, London and Sydney. I have learned through experience to stay on a high floor.When I booked the Doubletree, I had the option of paying a few more dollars for a high floor. We were on the 41st floor and it was great. The only noise we could hear was the occasional siren.Times Square is very central to everything in NYC. The location can't be beat. The down side is it very, very crowded at all hours of the day and night and maneuvering the crowds while going in and out of our hotel was a little daunting at times but manageable.My only complaint is when we were leaving this am, the doorman asked us if we needed a cab to the airport - we did. He then told us it would be $40 and tried to steer us towards a private car and driver. I said, 'No, it was only $32 from LGA on the way here' - knowing that there are a lot of 'faux taxis' out there that don't follow the NY Taxi Commission fare rates. The doorman said, 'well it all works out the same - $40' but he did point us to a yellow cab. The rate to the airport was, in fact, $32. I didn't appreciate the doorman's fib and the fact that he was steering us towards a private car. He could have explained our choices - private car $40 or taxi $32 and let us make that decision upfront.Other than that, excellent service and visit."
216,1791,"Oct 2 2008 	It Works....	I was staying at the doubletree while on a business trip. The facility (lobby, entrance, and bar) is under heavy construction, which makes getting around difficult at times. Despite the construction the rooms were in nice shape. This hotel &quot;works&quot; for a business trip, but I am not sure I would go there with my family until the construction is complete."
217,1791,"Sep 30 2008	Right in the Heart of Times Square/Broadway Theater District	This is a great, clean hotel right in the center of the action in Times Square and Broadway. It's a perfect stay for visitors, with everything right outside your door.There are 40+ floors, so street noise is not an issue. Instead, you'll get a SUITE, which is a rare thing in the Broadway area. Suites have a small fridge and a microwave and a separate living room from the bedroom, plus a TV in the bedroom and one in the living room.The lobby is currently undergoing renovations, but your stay shouldn't be affected. To get to the lobby, you enter on the street level and take the elevator to the lobby floor. So there really isn't much to the lobby anyway.We didn't eat in the hotel...why would anyone? There are tons of restaurants in Times Square and the neighboring Restaurant Row/Hell's Kitchen area. Take your pick.If you're looking for an awesome location, in the center of Manhattan, with a suite (plus Doubletree's fantastic chocolate chip cookies upon check in), this is the place for you."
218,1791,"Sep 17 2008	Nice location and room BUT. . .	My husband and I stayed in a King's Suite at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square on the 22nd floor (an alleged upgrade). As Hilton Honors Gold members, we received complimentary continental breakfast offered daily at the Center Stage Cafe restaurant and wireless internet service in our suite. The hotel is located in the midst of Times Square - great location but like most hotels in Times Square, no hotel driveway or great magnificent lobby! The hotel is very accessible to subway.There were, however, some kinks associated with our stay. Although the internet service was free, the connection was terrible! It was intermittent! Very frustrating. The king-sized bed was very comfortable except that the airconditioning vent blew straight to our heads and could not be repositioned! Their minibar system in the room was so sensitive that even if you slightly touched any of the soda cans, you will be instantly charged for the item even if you didn't buy it! We were charged for 4 items when we only purchased 2. Their only restaurant, Center Stage Cafe, on the 5th floor was alright - nothing great. Their bar/lounge next to the restaurant was pathetic! We had our cocktails elsewhere - there are many other nearby local bars which were far better and worth the walk. Hotel lobby was being refurbished when we were there.Probably would not return to this hotel - too bad because we really liked the size of the suite!"
219,1791,"Sep 16 2008 	great stay	The staff at the double tree are welcoming and very helpful from check in to check out. Finding band-aids, getting extra blankets, and easy baggage storage on our last day.Room was great worked out with kids in tow. All in all a great stay."
220,1791,"Sep 16 2008 	Would gladly stay here again	My husband and I stayed for the first time in New York City for 3 nights. This hotel was right in the action of Times Square, which we were not sure was a good idea. However we were pleasantly surprised with the Doubletree. The planned renovations did not start until the morning we were checking out. So we did not have issues with noise, dust etc. We were on the 35th floor and each night we slept very well. We never over heard other guests, traffic, staff etc. Great bed, 2 room suite, clean, huge bathroom and updated decor. Loved having a microwave, free room safe and wet bar. We were able to have &quot;dinner&quot; one night in our suite after shopping at Whole Foods. The hotel restaurant provided tableware for us without an issue. This hotel has the fastest elevators in town! We had a spectacular rate through the hotel website and got more than we paid for. If we ever return to New York and want to be in Times Sq., we would choose this hotel."
221,1791,"Sep 7 2008 	Great for Girls' Getaway	If you're looking for a spacious room for a girls' getaway weekend, this is it. Two comfortable queen size beds, if you don't mind sharing. The sofa bed in the sitting room is not so good for older gals' backs. Two sinks on the vanity and one on the wet bar provided each person her own space. Situated right in the heart of things. Memorable!"
222,1791,"Aug 30 2008 	Good location for family stay	Stayed for a week with wife and three teenage daughters. Hotel was clean, quiet (we had an upper level room) . I thought it good value for money. One tip- when using the sofa bed follow the instructions exactly and don't remove any of the sofa cushions prior to folding it out or it won't be comfortable.Not stayed in any other NY hotels but would guess the rooms were larger than average."
223,1791,"Aug 29 2008 	Really nice!	Three of us checked in for 4 nights on August 23. We had 2 double beds, sofa bed in living room, wet bar and large bathroom with double sinks. Very clean and good layout. The staff is excellent!. Everyone does their best to please you! At the corner of 7th Ave. and 47th St. you walk out of the hotel and the subway is right next door and that is great!"
224,1791,"Aug 27 2008 	Busy quiet crazy calm!	Yes, Yes, Yes!This hotel is great. Clean, quiet and next to all the chaos of NYC!The room which had two beds and a sofa bed was a decent size and fitted four adults. The sofa bed was a little soft but was better than sharing! Being on the 42nd floor, it was also very quiet.The bathroom was also good, the shower being really good and eased out those long hours of walking I did.The concierge was very helpful, we where able to book our bus tours and outlet store excursion there without any problems. They also offered theatre tickets, but you could find a tourist centre located very close to the hotel which offered a better variety of things to do.The laundry service was a little expensive considering what I had cleaned (underwear, etc).The breakfast was expensive, save your money and venture out to the many places located around the hotel.When you stepped out of the hotel you where welcomed by the frenzy that Times Square is, madness, but I loved every minute of it.Ideal location, ideal hotel, ideal holiday!"
225,1791,"Aug 26 2008	where the action is	Comfortable, clean hotel with warm choc chip cookies, great king size bed, and adjoining living space (smallish but manageable) with sofabed and large screen tv; located in the heart of Times Square;"
226,1791,"Aug 25 2008	Most convenient location	We were parents and adult sons staying here for three nights in August. We recommend this hotel if you want a central location, walking distance from many attractions and shopping and literally on top of a subway station. The hotel will work for you if you are happy with a large impersonal but clean and efficient experience at this type of location for a reasonable price..However, do not expect any form of personlised service. Do not expect the room staff to respond to written requests to leave enough non-decaff coffee sachets for the number in the party or to do anything else non-standard. Do not expect the concierge to give you any help which doesn't involve selling you something, and do not expect to have breakfast in the restaurant without queueing for at least 30 minutes with an inefficient system. Also be aware that the one downside of the location is that most of the time to enter or leave the building you have to fight your way through the hoards of people queueing for the theatre next door and when you get into the ground floor lobby you will be accosted by security guards before taking the first of two lifts to get to your room."
227,1791,"Aug 22 2008 	Terrific hotel!!	We stayed at this hotel from August 8th until the 11th of 2008. It is very well located, at the heart of Times Square (corner of 7th Avenue and 47th St.). Broadway theaters are within sight (less than 2 minutes walking distance). Nice restaurants are in the vecinity (5 minutes walking). Also very nice stores close by (Swatch, Toys RUs, 5th Avenue is just two blocks away!).The DoubleTree is in very good condition, no complaints about the room, halls, elevators, entrance, lobby and facilities. The bedrooms are big (by New York standards) and are equiped with a refrigerator (in addition to the minibar) a microwave, sink, coffee maker and a full sofa bed (very comfortable!). House keeping will bring you the kitchen utensils at your request.You can easily accomodate six persons on the two double beds and a sofa bedrooms. These rooms (the two double beds ones) dont have a view to Times Square but to the adjacent street. If you want to have a nice view of Times Square you need to book a one king bedroom (high floor preferable).The bath room has double doors, so you can conveniently access it from the room or the living room. There is a flat tv in the living room with a game control for the kids (nintendo) and plenty of games to choose from the menu (USD6.95 per 60 minutes). This keeps the children entertained while in the room (so you can get a nap or relax). There is another flat tv in the bedroom (while my teenage daughter watched the Jonas Brothers, my other two small children were having fun with the video games).The service is very good. The staff will really strive to get you what you ordered, specially the ones at the front desk (the concierge was ok). My praise to the three dominican girls at the frontdesk, they were fabulous!! In spite of the absurd amount of people walking around Times Square, it is not hard to enter or leave the hotel. There is no noise at all in the hotel (bedrooms or lobby). The restaurant is not that good, in fact it is the reason I dont give this hotel 5 points (just 4 points). It is ridiculously expensive..not worth it at all."
228,1791,"Aug 14 2008 	Watch Out for Bedbugs!	My husband, daughter and I stayed here in 2007, and had a great time. This year ('08) we booked an 8 night stay and expected another good experience. Unfortunately, nearly half of our stay was ruined by the appearance of bedbugs and the aftermath--changing rooms, making reports for Housekeeping, Security, and Hotel Management, cleaning our clothing, etc! The staff did an admirable job in communicating with us and trying to correct the problem (or so we thought), and assured us that this was an incredibly rare occurrance. We were given a free night for a future stay, as well as other niceties for our trouble---we chalked up the bugs to an unfortunate aberration.Our daughter was subsequently invited to audition for a NYC dance company the first of August, so we decided to give the DoubleTree a second chance and book our two-night stay with them. MISTAKE. I couldn't believe it when, after a difficult day a traveling, missed connections, and lost baggage, my nervous daughter finally settled into bed and cried out, &quot;Oh, my G--, Mom! You're not going to believe this!&quot; I looked down, and there, in the sheets, was yet another bug! Despite the personable and well-meaning staff (especially Julia), I will NEVER stay in this hotel again--they obviously have some on-going issues they still need to address properly."
229,1791,"Aug 10 2008 	I second that. Business travelers beware!! Ok for families though...	Our family visited in August 2008 for a 4 day stay. While we weren't in Manhattan on business, we had NO internet connection from our room. For a hotel in the middle of Times Square? Very frustrating, and an absolute travesty if you were there on business. Luckily we didn't absolutely require internet in our room so it wasn't the end of the world. Otherwise, the hotel accommodations were comfortable and the beds were very nice/soft. There was a microwave and a small fridge in our suite, which was very helpful with two small children. Our room was pretty small for a family of 4, but it was doable. We used the pullout bed in the living room so that helped a bit. We had a nice view from the 31st Floor, and the location could not be beat. We were able to see the recently released Broadway show Legally Blonde (very funny, BTW) directly next to the hotel... and you're about a 7 block walk from Central Park. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant and it appeared that not many others did either, as it was a dead zone. However, they did provide utensils and plates for meals that you had in your room... also nice for families."
230,1791,"Aug 10 2008 	Good with Kids	I am torn about my review for this hotel. My husband and I stayed here with two kids, (11 and 13) for four nights at the beginning of August. We received a rate through the hotel website for 429.00 per night, which included breakfast for four at the hotel restaurant. For a two bedroom suite in New York, this was a great value, but the hotel itself was just okay. We received a corner room on the 29th floor that had a great view of Times Square, but the room itself was smaller than the rest of the rooms. There was a small fridge, microwave, in-room safe, and sink. We were able to buy drinks and snacks from a nearby Duane-Reade, which helped save some money since room service and in-room snack center were very expensive. The lobby and front desk staff were friendly, and we never encountered any long lines.  We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant our first day, and it was not very good. Like the rest of New York, it was pricey. The breakfast buffet, which was included in our rate, was very good. In addition to hot and cold buffet items, they had a cook-to-order station with eggs, waffles, pancakes, and french toast. The hot and cold buffets had a great variety of fresh fruit, oatmeal with a wide variety of mix-ins, and numerous other items.  The reason I am torn about my review is that, while I was not impressed with the hotel overall, I still felt that it was a good value for New York. Here were the problems: The bathroom was not completely clean upon check in. I called and no one ever made it up to finish cleaning. The iron in the room was broken, and when we tried to use it, water poured out all over the clothes. Again, I called about this and it was never replaced. The room itself was just okay, very plain and a little run down. The hotel has no rollaway beds available.  We did not have any problems with the internet--the hotel website states that there is a per day charge for access; however, we received the Hilton signal and it did not require a password or code. It was not terribly slow. The workout facility was decent-elliptical and treadmills with televisions, free weights and machines. It is open 24 hours, which is convenient.  Overall, it was a good value for the amount of space(although get a rate quote INCLUDING taxes, as they are very high in NYC--our 429.00 rate was much higher once taxes were added)."
231,1791,Aug 10 2008	Great place to stay great location	We loved the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. The location was convienient to all Broadway Shows. We could walk anywhere we wanted to. The suites are large and clean. We will definitely return !!!
232,1791,Aug 6 2008 	A Great Location and Nice Experience	Great Location - GREAT LOCCATIONFriendly StaffDefinitely a great place for/with kids or family.Large two room accommodations.
233,1791,"Jul 31 2008 	business travelers beware	This is fine hotel unless you need a speedy internet (abysmally slow and their internet provider is atrocious--must have spent 4 hours to no avail), help from the front desk (they can't do anything with their computers to print out anything other than one receipt one way for a trip--tough if you need different receipts for different sources reimbursements), or a polite doorperson (who doesn't yell at you if you don't select the cab he wants even though he is highly enmeshed in a conversation with a friend and doesn't lift a finger to help you with luggage on the way out). On the plus side, the rooms are large and good for families. If I wasn;t travelling on business and I didn't need the internet, I might stay there if I wanted a middle-of-Times Square experience."
234,1791,"Jul 31 2008 	Good overall experience	The staff is terrific, very nice and helpful. The lobby is on the second floor and is not pleasant especially when tour groups are coming or going. There are good features in the rooms - microwave, decent size half refrigerator, marble counters in bathroom and in the &quot;kitchen&quot; area. Kitchen has a small sink. There was enough room for 3 people. My biggest complaint was the hide-a-bed. It was a mystery how to open it up -- we had to call for help. It also was not very comfortable. But that is not a big deal. The location is great and there are small grocery stores close by. It's quite close to Rockefeller Center. Overall, we were pleased and our room was comfortable. The hotel entrance really is right in Times Square (the northern end)."
235,1791,"Jul 30 2008 	Best Holiday Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!	We arrived at the hotel on 8th of jan, a family of 5 and we stayed for a week. as we arrived at the hotel from our stretch limo the buzz of the streets totally shocked us. All we did all week was SHOP. it is the best place to shop ever specially in jan sales as everything is sooooo cheap!i would definately stay here again if i ever visit NYC again. Best stay ever!!"
236,1791,"Jul 28 2008 	Highly Recommended Hotel in Times Square	Searched high and low for several weeks for a reasonably priced hotel for a family of 5. Having lived in New York City, I balked at having to pay an average of $600 per night (for 2 rooms) so finding this option was great. Very clean room, plenty of space and everything WORKED. Check-in/check-out was super fast and being in the middle of Times Square was a bonus. Our room was on the 9th floor so not particularly high up and did not have a view of Times Square itself but was amazingly quiet. Also, there are plenty of eateries nearby to counteract the over priced hotel restaurant! I would recommend the Doubletree to anyone and will certainly plan to stay there on future visits."
237,1791,"Jul 25 2008 	great hotel	stayed here for 3 nights with 3 teenagers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly (thanks 2 Yanni) original suite was not available when we arrived and we were asked if we would take a smaller room for one night then we were upgraded to our original size of suite but this time on the 43rd floor with 5 complimentary breakfasts for 3 days which was great. View of Times Square from the top of the hotel was fantastic. Great location, helpful staff, would definitely recommend"
238,1791,Jul 21 2008	Clean and Compact	Nice and clean suite with good housekeeping service. Great location at the top of times square. Small and dangerous valet/taxi pull-up space. Small lobby area. Small hallways and suite. Small restaurant on 5th floor (windowless I think). Parking attendant cleaned out my car change.
239,1791,"Jul 17 2008 	PERFECT with 2 KIDS!	My husband, 2 kids and I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square for 4 nights recently and LOVED IT! Have stayed in more &quot;posh&quot; hotels in NYC, but this was perfect with kids. We requested a Times Square view upon check-in, which they delivered happily (they also explained that corner rooms are smaller - we agreed we could live with that in order to have a view). Rooms ending in &quot;1, 2 or 3&quot; face Times Square. Our room was on the 15th floor (1503) and we hardly heard any street noise (other than the occasional siren). Staff was accommodating and friendly.The room was clean every day and bed was SO comfy. The kids loved having their &quot;own room&quot; with a TV. Don't know how comfy the sofa bed was - they didn't complain. The refrigerator in the room was convenient - we stocked it with drinks and snacks from Duane Reade pharmacy. On our way out each morning, we would just fill our backpack with our drinks and snacks. This kept the kids happy throughout the day and saved us some money. All in all, was a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.I also recommend taking the Grayline double decker buses. We bought a 2 day All Loops Pass online (cheaper). It was $160.00 for 2 days (4 people) which breaks down to $20.00 day per person - cheap! It's an easy and enjoyable way to see everything and get up and down the island. Hop on and off as many times as you want. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus, although sometimes pick up locations were a block off. We did the Uptown and Downtown Loops over and over again. When your feet get tired, hop on the next bus and ride for awhile. Don't lose the map they give you and you'll be in good shape! The tour guides vary greatly - some are more informative and interesting than others. The Night Tour guide had us laughing and singing all the way. We did not do the Brooklyn Loop, as the Night Loop tours Brooklyn (I would urge you to do the Night Loop - great fun). You can take the subway, but of course there's no view underground, and it can get really hot and crowded. The top of the bus is cool enough, and below it is air conditioned. I was concerned that the kids would not get to see everything in 5 days, but with the bus, we were able to see it all and have a great time doing it.Have fun and enjoy your trip!"
240,1791,Jul 13 2008 	Perfect location great customer service	We only needed 1 night and got a great rate through AAA. Part of the deal is that you get a room on a higher floor. This is much needed because the hotel is in the middle of Times Square. We loved the location and the customer service was outstanding. The beds were very comfortable. The room was quiet. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
241,1791,"Jul 11 2008	Great Trip	My son and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites last week for 5 nights &amp; were very happy. The AARP rate was $250/night which seemed like a great rate to me for 2 rooms &amp; 2 TVS! The rooms were clean, bedding very comfy with plenty of fluffy pillows (not flat, foam ones) &amp; nice, big bath towels. Sofabed was tolerable for my son. Only negative was the slightly dingy shower &amp; lousy bathroom lighting. We were on the 38th floor so Times Square noise wasn't an issue. Service was very pleasant though we only dealt with the front desk. Great location for walking to theater &amp; hopping on a subway; got very tired of the mob scene in Times Square after the 3rd day or so but would definitely stay there again. Loved NYC!"
242,1791,"Jul 10 2008	Corner rooms smaller	If you like to be able to have a lot to do at night, then Times Square is the place to go- and Doubletree Guest Suites is a great location. This area felt fairly safe for a woman too. Don't expect to be wowed by the entrance and lobby though. Both are pretty bare bones. The bar area was also dead. The room was clean, the staff was nice, and the bed and pillows were really soft. Our corner room was smaller than our friend's room. Better views, but noticeably smaller. This and the Marriott Times Square are the most conveniently located hotels that I saw while in New York. I would definitely go back. Make sure you try to get a better rate than what they quote you."
243,1791,"Jul 10 2008 	Wonderful despite...	We're a family of 4 with small kids and lots of luggage so the hotel room was a bit cramped. The bathroom door wouldn't lock and the pull-out bed was not a suprising discomfort. We didn't get the breakfast, nor did we eat in the hotel's restaurant. We were desperate enough to buy a $5 soda from the minibar! Oh, and the coffee bar downstairs had delicious muffins and croissants. The cleaning staff came late on our 2nd day and wanted to clean while we were there. I guess that's a good thing. The A/C was good and cold and the views were outstanding!! It would be fair to say that we had the best views around on the 18th floor. It was challenging to locate the hotel by car due to all the one-way streets, but the concierge was truly a gentlemen and helped us find our way. We didn't have any problems with check-in or check-out and we were asked for our room key a few times until they began to recognize us. We felt safe and secure and are sure we left with everything we brought. The bell captains were very accomodating, even storing and charging our scooter. I hope our tips were enough. Make sure you have enough towels and pillows and always ask for extra coffee, cups and sugar.All in all, with a decent room and price, this is the place to stay. Though, I heard staying around Wall St. is much cheaper, we wanted the action and lights of Times Square - and we got it in full force! We should have: brought umbrellas, our own totebags for souvenirs, foldable seats for the fireworks; and bought metro cards for the buses and subways, the double-decker tour bus pass and some groceries. We did: bring cash for tips; wear comfortable shoes; valet park our car and forgot about it for 4 days while we used every conceivable mode of transportation available in NYC; receive, from the hotel, 2 great kiddie backpacks filled with toys as well as the yummy cookies.Enjoy your vacations!"
244,1791,"Jul 8 2008 	Loved the Doubletree	Our family of four stayed here for 7 days and absolutely loved it. The location is the best. Within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shows and the subway is right next door. The best part is having two rooms and three beds (one is the fold out couch). This kept us from being too crowded. With a 13 and 20 year old, we needed some room. Also, two tv's were nice for downtime. One on ESPN and one on Food Network. The fridge came in very handy to keep extra water and cokes on hand. Bathroom is big and you can also use the mini bar area for someone to get ready in as it has a mirror and sink also. Times Square is constantly bustling with cars and people but in the rooms it is very quiet. They have soundproofed very nicely. We had a problem with our tv remotes twice and within 15 minutes they brought new ones. Towels were brought also with 15 minutes. Everyone was friendly and very eager to help. They check your key before allowing entry to the hotel which I liked for the added security. We will definitely stay here again when coming back to NYC. It is also central to everything in Manhattan and we were all over the city. Doubletree makes a great home base and is well worth the price. McDonalds is right next door so the kids could go down at midnight and get a snack and it was very convenient for a quick breakfast. I've heard NY has very small hotel rooms but that is not the case at Doubletree."
245,1791,"Jul 5 2008 	Poor Service	Excellent location for those visiting NYC, however there were service issues. Agent at check in desk took a long time to as she put it- find us a great room- it was there standard room, with no special features ( view, corner etc). We were told it would be a 15 minute wait to take our bags to our room- the lobby was completley overwhelmed with carts of luggaget. It looked like baggage claim at JFK, not a 500/ night hotel! We carried ours up. Security was extremley lax- we were only asked for our room keys once. Bathroom tile was cracked, and the furnishings looked a bit outdated. When checking out, we asked for help, told they would be up in 5 minutes, after waiting 20, we carried our own bags (again). Improvements in staff service would greatly improve the quality of stay."
246,1791,"Jul 1 2008	Trip of a Lifetime-Double Tree Times Square	3 CDN ladies just enjoyed 6 nights in NYC. Stayed at the Double Tree in Times Square. They did not have the room we booked with 2 doubles on our arrival so gave us a King, $50. off per night and complimentry buffet breakfast daily for our stay(that is $77. per day); Location is perfect-you can walk miles to so many attractions. Room was clean, great service and the only complaint is the pull out couch. It was NOT comfortable. But the rest of the trip made up for it. Our best day was when walking to Grand Central we made a wrong turn and ended up in Hells Kitchen. We met some elderly locals at coffee shop and that was a highlight of NYC. We did all the tourist spots, shopped, loved Chinatown and Little Italy and shopped some more! 3 major thunderstorms added to excitement! We saw 4 plays and that too was a highlight. Try the Hop on Hop Off bus-2 days is enough and then we travelled by cab. Inexpensive. Food was pricey but quantities just too large. One dish of anything will feed 3 ladies. Beware and don't over order. We felt very safe at all times and did not use the underground. Grab your girlfriends, bid adios to the men and fly off to NYC. You will not be sorry............"
247,1791,"Jun 29 2008 	I thought I'd get more for $500 a night	This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in, and it wasn't worth the money. Some disappointments included a room service tray with leftovers that sat outside my door for almost 12 hours even though I called for a pickup. I had to call again before it was removed. Oh, and when the room service was delivered the server felt compelled to comment upon how much food we had ordered. Tacky.A piece of molding was taped to the wall with masking tape in my $500-a-night room. There was a musty unpleasant smell in the ice machine room. To force their guests to buy cans of soda from the in-room minibar at $5.25 per can, there are no soda vending machines in the hotel. The remote control for the TV in the separate bedroom didn't work, and the TV wouldn't work without it. And lastly for the disappointments, there was a noticeable lack of security at the entrance, which is directly on Times Square and believe you me, there are some strange people on the streets in Time Square. I was never asked to show my room key. The good points for this hotel: my room was clean and neat, with good temperature control. There was a phone in the bathroom in case of emergencies, and the shower worked well. The street noise was muffled and wasn't noticeable from the 22nd floor. Which meant the hotel room was a nice respite from the chaos of a weekend in Times Square.Overall, this hotel was not worth $500 a night, and I woudn't stay here again."
248,1791,"Jun 27 2008	Love Love Loved It!	I absolutely loved my stay at the Doubletree. I was there for three nights in a one bedroom suite. The bed was extremely comfortable (which is very important to me on vacation) . The room was clean and well maintained. And the view from the hotel window was amazing (it really helps if you love the city like I do). Also, the hotel is located in a convenient area for going to shows, etc. One of the hotel staff members knew that I was there to celebrate my birthday, so when I arrived in my room, there was a fruit and cheese tray waiting for me. Overall, very pleasant and calm stay in a busy city."
249,1791,"Jun 26 2008 	Family of 4 LOVED the Doubletree Guest Suites	Our family of 4 recently enjoyed a great stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was also large and clean. We didn't notice any signs of disrepair or neglect of maintenance and our suite was always very clean. The location was wonderful and centrally located. We knew we would be arriving at the hotel early so we called the night before check in. They asked us to call the hotel when we were on our way so when we arrived, our room was ready. We were also allowed to check out at 1:00 on our departure date since we had a late flight."
250,1791,"Jun 22 2008	Love the Doubletree Times Square	When traveling with a family, it is the only hotel that I have found that offers a suite in Times Square. We have 2 teenagers - boy and girl - so our son slept on the sofa bed (okay-typical sofa bed) my daughter had her own full/queen bed in the bedroom with us Worked fine as we stayed on a few nights, yet, much longer and the bed gets a little small for the 2 of us as we are use to a king at home. Nice large bathroom and there is as bar area in the living room which helped having an extra sink when getting ready in the morning. GREAT LOCATION. Staff seemed nice."
251,1791,"Jun 14 2008 	Acceptable for Broadway	If you're going to see a Broadway show and want to be &quot;right there&quot; this is a good place to consider. However, if you're looking for anything other than your standard hotel stay, this is not the place.This hotel is very similar to a large convention center hotel - it's an assembly line process with too many people and too few staff to devote too much attention to guests. Odd are you'll have a decent amount of wait time if you want to check in at a peak time, have bags taken to your room, etc.The rooms themselves are fairly simple. They have &quot;modern&quot; hotel decor though it's got a very strong Ikea look to it. The bathrooms are adequate, though my tub looked like it could have used some a stronger dose of ajax cleaner. Some of the towel were old and a bit tough, while others were new and very soft.I'm sure the views from the room vary, but I had a good view of times square and could see down Broadway to Central Park. The hotel had wifi for a nominal fee. I got a strong signal and a good connection.Normally I don't eat at a hotel, but for some reason or another I had a free breakfast, so I decided to give it a shot. It was a breakfast buffet and the food was ok. (It's hard to mess up pancakes, muffins, fruit, and cereal). The service left much to be desired, but as I mentioned - this is an assembly line hotel.If you want to be close to Broadway and won't be doing much but sleeping in your room, this hotel will probably work just fine. If you want a nicer hotel, I'd consider some other choices."
252,1791,"Jun 9 2008 	Rude and Careless	It appears our terrible recent experience at this hotel was shared by some more recent guests per these reviews. The positive is the location. The negatives are the rude staff (for example, we booked and paid for two rooms for a family of 6 four months ahead of time; because of flight delays we were late to check in and were kept waiting at midnight for almost 15 minutes after a 16 hour commute; only to be told our rooms had been given away, but to try again the next night ... !), and tired rooms. I could give another ten instances were the level of service was appalling (we were charged again on checking out even though we had paid before !!! and yet whenever our kids asked for a cookie at reception they were reminded that only 1 per guest per stay was the rule) but suffice to say - we have never experienced the contempt for customers we received here and will never, ever return."
253,1791,"Jun 3 2008 	Great place to stay	We can't say enough about how wonderful our stay here was. From the doorman down on the street level all the way to the housekeepers and maintenance man. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. The warm chocolate chip cookies didn't hurt either! Our room was on the 28th floor and a corner room overlooking Times Square. Even though we were directly across the elevators, the room was still very quite. The hotel is located where we would could get the subway, bus or a taxis without walking far. (Walking around this great city is another story!) We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The location is great, the employees are outstanding and the hotel itself is tops. Thank you for making our first stay to NYC fantastic. We will definitely be back."
254,1791,"Jun 2 2008 	Brilliant central location for first visit to New York	Have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Doubletree. As we had been led to expect , hotel right in the heart of Times Square with all the crowds of people so no surprises! We were on the 42nd Floor with great views and virtually no street noise unless we opened the window! The suite was perfect for us holidaying with two teenagers (13 and 15yrs) - TV's in both living area and bedroom so no arguments! Doors to bathroom from bedroom and living area - with one child on sofabed in living area this meant less disturbance at night. Hotel location excellent - easy to visit Empire State Building, Maceys etc on foot and there is a subway station next door to hotel. Excellent diner round the corner (Evergreen) and great choice of restaurants in walking distance including Ruby Tuesdays and Joe's Broadway Grill on 46th St. Didn't use hotel restaurant. Pre-booked tickets on-line beforehand for Lion King (superb) and also for ESB and for 3 hour Manhattan island boat tour with Circle Line which we can thoroughly recommend. Also took Gray Line bus tours Uptown and Downtown - both guides on these tours gave interesting and funny commentaries and was great way to get a taste of all the different neighbourhoods. Grand Central Station worth a visit - look at the ceilings. No real problems with hotel - room was clean although some of the wooden furniture was a bit tatty. Only v. minor issues during our stay i.e. batteries flat in one TV remote and also reception forgot warm cookies when checking-in but both resolved straight away. Would definitely stay here again with family."
255,1791,May 30 2008 	Gets Worse Every Year	Check-in was unpleasant. The bathroom sink drained very slowly and the room was dirty. This place gets worse every year. We will not be back.
256,1791,"May 30 2008 	CleanGood Value	Ok, So just got back from a five day break with the family to the Doubletrees Guest Suites Hotel in Times Square.First the negatives (Thankfully few):- Only one TV remote for two televisions - to be honest this was not enough of a problem for me to even bother the hotel management.Coffee making facilities, whilst potentially great, as others have mentioned the cardboard cups were a bit of a disappointment. Also on one day the milk appeared to be &quot;off&quot;.Did not try food - so cannot comment on this aspect of hotel. On the plus side - location is of course great; whilst we were there my girls (17 and 14) joined a large crowd to try to catch a glimpse of Usher at the MTV shop over the road and then on our last day there appeared to be some sort of TV show/audition for the lead in Legally Blonde which was in the theatre next door.Although we were in the heart of Times Square, our suite on the 22nd floor meant that there was little to disturb us by way of traffic noise etc. The drapes did a good job of keeping out the walls of neon just when you needed them to.I should also like to congratulate the hotel on its levels of cleanliness - the maids really do a good job and the rooms were spotless.( Whilst returning to the airport in a shuttle, we were taken to some of the other hotels used by International travellers and believe me I was glad to have chosen Doubletrees Guest Suites)."
257,1791,May 27 2008 	Horrible	Upon checking in we were told we would have to wait until 4:30 or 5 for the room that was assigned to us (check-in is supposed to be at 3!)--unless we wanted to take a different (code for &quot;less desirable&quot; room.) We had paid extra for a room with a view of Times Square. The room itself was shabby and filthy. There were black hairs on the white sheets and on the bathroom floor. The bathroom does not have a fan so the entire suite smelled damp and musty. The people at the front desk are extremely rude and unhelpful. We have stayed here before and every year it gets worse. We will not stay here again.
258,1791,"May 27 2008 	Another great stay!	This was our 3rd stay at the Doubletree Times Square and once again, we were very pleased. We booked a Triple A rate for $305 for the holiday week-end, which was not that bad I thought. The suites are large with a door seperating the living area and bedroom area, seperate bathroom doors leading to the LR and BR. Microwave and refrigerator. We were on the 25th floor and only heard one siren in the course of three days, not much of a view from our room this time, but that was okay. Staff could not be more accommodating, Concierge service outstanding. We were assisted in purchasing the Express Pass for the Empire State Bldg and it saved us at least 90 minutes in line. Hotel location is key here, with every theater within walking distance, subway station steps away, and plenty of eateries and shopping. Small diner called &quot;Evergreen&quot; around the corner for a reasonable breakfast. Hotel parking is also around the corner and is $35 self park and $45 valet, we were able to pull right up front to unload and load. The property is very busy and if there is a down side to the hotel, it would be you have to take one elevator from the street to the lobby, then another elevator from the lobby to your suite, so at busy times there was a short wait. In addition, if crowds bother you, then this location may be &quot;too busy&quot;, because hoards of people are in this area day and way into the night. Hold your children's hands tightly."
259,1791,"May 23 2008 	Just what I needed after running the Boston Marathon	I ran the Boston marathon, woke up the next day, drove to New York and stayed at the Doubletree for 3 nights with my 3 children. It was perfect. Right in the heart of Times Square, everything you need within walking distance. (or barely walking...as I was recovering from the race) Starbucks, Greyline, Rays Pizza, M &amp; Ms store, St. Patrick's Cathedral...and much more. It felt safe and easy and it was comfortable with 2 rooms and 2 T.V.s. The best thing was that they allowed 5 people since it had 2 beds plus the pull-out sofa. Many hotels in New York limit you to 4 people so then you have to sneak one of your kids in...which is weird when you're paying almost $500 a night. Would definitely stay there again if I ever take my whole family to NY again...we had a great time."
260,1791,"May 21 2008	Super location clean room nice staff	We were on the 31st floor in a room that had a double bedroom, a bathroom and a lounge area that had a small kitchenette. With double-glazed windows and being so high, the room was very quiet. The lounge had a sofa that was also a fold-away bed. I slept on this during our stay and it was not the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in, but bearable for a few days. Both the lounge and bedroom had large wide screen TVs.The Kitchenette was simply a small cabinet top with a microwave and a fridge that was the size of a 19inch television. There was no oven hobb. A slight irritation was caused by the kitchenette not having any crockery or cutley. We made use of the Kitchenette for breakfast in the morning, but we had to first go to the local 'Duane Reade' drugstore and buy some plastic cutley and paper plates. The room was decorated quite nicely and, including the bathroom, was clean. The major selling point of this hotel is its location; being right on Times Square. Super convenient for the theatres, shopping, subway and restaurants. We were even able to walk to Port Authority (5 blocks) when the time came to catch the bus to the airport and fly home. The hotel had a restaurant, but we found the food quite average but because of its location to so many alternatives this didn't really matter.I would be happy to stay at the Doubletree again. (You each get a quite delicious cookie when you first check in)."
261,1791,"May 20 2008 	Nice Theatre District property	Whether you are travelling alone or with kids, if you want to be in the heart of Manhattan action, look no further.A two-room suite with a kitchenette at this price in the centre of Manhattan doesn't easily get beaten.You are right on Times Square (which, for some people, may not be the ideal place to stay), within walking distance of most Broadway theatres and restaurants and within walking distance also of Fifth Avenue shopping, the MoMA, Time Warner Centre, Rockefeller Centre, the Empire State Building and Central Park. How do you better this?Our suite on one of the highest floors overlooked Times Square and Manhattan skyscrapers and we loved the view.The suite had a bedroom and a sitting/living room, with a television in each of them, a largish bathroom (two sinks), a kitchenette (with crockery and cutlery available if you wish), a Wolfgang Puck coffee maker with unlimited supplies of gourmet tea and coffee, Neutrogena toiletries, an in-room safe,iron and ironing board, a referigerated mini-bar and an additional empty referigerator for guest use. The hotel also has a very efficient laundry service. All the stuff you need to make your Manhattan stay comfortable.I would have been happier though had brighter colors been used in the suite interior. Dark colors do tend to make the suite less cheery than it could have been.The staff are exceptionally nice to you, at every level. Housekeeping could be better though. Use the Concierge's desk only for information but stay away from it for theatre bookings. Lots cheaper if you call Ticketmaster.If the Times Square action right outside is agreeable to you, this is an excellent option."
262,1791,"May 15 2008 	Large space Great Location	Four ladies booked this hotel for a New York getaway staying for four days. The location was perfect for walking to most all of the attractions in the city. We appreciated the kitchenette, complete with sink and mirror, which doubled as a second place for applying makeup and fixing hair.The rooms were well appointed and more spacious than most others in other NYC hotels. The bedding was plush, pillows soft. The TV's were old style rather than flat screen. We did have a problem with noisey neighbors who had no respect for anyone trying to sleep, partying at all times of the night.The bath was large with good sound proofing, which was good since the pipes in our room clunked when water was on. The towels were large and thick. We did have a problem obtaining a cab one rainy morning. The doorman told us the other doorman, who evidently obtains cabs for guests, was not there at the moment and he would not help us. We hailed our own cab on a side street in the rain. Don't try to secure a cab yourself from the line of cabs in front of the hotel with an &quot;Off Duty&quot; sign. They will only respond when the doorman from the hotel hires them for a guest.The McDonald's next door was handy for a quick breakfast. The best bargain was the 72 hour Hop On and Off Grayline Tour Bus ticket that we obtained on the internet for $55.00. The pick-up site is only a block away."
263,1791,"May 11 2008 	Great Location - Good Value	If you're looking to be in the hustle and bustle of NYC, you have to consider Times Square. This hotel is right in the middle of it and considering the size of most NYC hotel rooms, the Doubletree Suites is a great value. The NRW subway line is right next to the hotel entrance, so getting around by subway is a breeze. Being in the heart of Times Square guarantees you access to a taxi without much of a wait. There are plenty of restaurants just steps from the entrance of the hotel, from high-end steak houses to chain restaurants to McDonalds, it's all right there. Hotel staff were polite and accommodating. Service in the restaurant within the hotel and the hotel bar was slow and food was 'just okay'. French Onion Soup was odd and very salty, while the chicken quesadilla was actually quite good. Room was spacious. Separate bedroom and living area. Couch unfolds to a bed. Work desk is very nice. Room includes a small fridge which didn't get quite cold enough for dairy products, but good enough for what I needed. There's also a microwave and single-cup coffee maker which I bordered on over-using. I left a note for housekeeping to leave extra coffee (standard is two packs of regular and one of decaf) and I ended up with quite the stash of coffee packs!One error on the bill when I checked out which was quickly taken care of with a smile. I would stay here again if I needed to be in the midtown area."
264,1791,"May 10 2008 	NY Weekend	The location is great if you want to be in a very busy area, and it's within walking distance of theaters, shopping, etc. We stayed the weekend (Fri-Sun) on the 24th floor (very quiet room, but poor view). The front desk staff was very courteous, quick to respond to requests and the bell staff stored our luggage until check-in and at check-out (one bell person was rude at check-out but he seemed to be having a bad day). Our room was not entirely clean - dirt on sheets, hair in the bathroom - so we had to request housekeeping clean the room again, which they did. The room size was adequate for 3 adults (considered large by NYC standards but this was our first visit so hard to judge), but lighting in the bedroom was below average and the bathroom lacked an exhaust fan. We plan to return to NYC next year but will probably not return to this hotel, mainly because we'd like to be on a less congested street and considering the costs ($459 + taxes per night) we can stay somewhere nicer for the same amount."
265,1791,May 5 2008 	Great location but sketchy service...	Went to NYC for a Girls Weekend. Decided to stay here for location even though much more pricey than other hotels.Check-in was great. Very helpful at the front desk and the concierge desk. Bell hops and restaurant staff pretty rude as we were not treated very nice. Breakfast buffett is a joke. Had to beg for silverware and they had run out of clean napkins. No one there yet had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Restaurant is drab and food is bad!! The beds are comfortable but the showers are dirty. Would probably stay somewhere else next time as way to busy area are too loud outside to sleep...
266,1791,"May 1 2008 	Paid the price to enjoy Manhattan	We visited Manhattan this April and searched for an inexpensive place to stay. Tripadvisor reviews for inexpensive hotels were so terrible that I decided to go for a higher level hotel. Found great reviews for this hotel and decided to pay $400 per night for a family of 5.Turned out that it was a good deal - we got a clean, well-maintained and service-oriented place to stay, right in the middle of Manhattan, so we could stroll easily to most of the attractions we were there to see. We arrived very early to the hotel (much before official check-in time) and were given our room right away, plus a warm cookie as a welcome present (small gesture, but pretty effective)."
