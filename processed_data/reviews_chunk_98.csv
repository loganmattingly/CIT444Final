341,2064,"May 5 2004	Fab Views	We stayed at the Holiday Inn for a few days at the end of April, found the staff very helpful and were lucky enough to get a high floor room, so the views of the bay were fantastic. The Lobby Bar was also very pleasant for a drink. The Hotel is in a good location, about 10 minutes walk from Union Square for shopping and about 10 minutes walk from North Beach for some lovely restaurants. Overall a very clean and pleasant hotel."
342,2064,"May 4 2004	Very nice!	We loved it! Clean, gorgeous rooms, attentive staff, etc. We couldn't really ask for anything more."
343,2064,"May 1 2004	Stayed at this one twice during April nice place!	Stayed at the Holiday-Inn location twice during the moth of April. Had relatives visit and went to Disneyland, S.F., Las Vegas during this past month. Stayed in this hotel from April 1-4 and had a great view of S.F. from my room. Close to Chinatown and the other attractions within a short driving distance. Then later stayed one night again at the end of the month so they could get to SFO airport for their departure.Excellent service and very clean with lots of space inside their rooms. Parking is on the expensive side though, but you get in and out pass for being a guest at the hotel so that's nice if you have rented a car during your stay and want to do some driving in the City. Highly recommended if you go to S.F."
344,2064,"Apr 23 2004	Great for a spa break	We stayed here for just one night as we had a number of treatments booked at the TruTherapy spa in the lobby of the hotel. The hotel is an ugly concrete block adjacent to the TransAmerica Pyramid and Bank of America Tower. The inside of the hotel is fine, though I wouldn't go as far to say that it's luxurious. I would recommend paying the supplement to get an executive room as we had a great view of the bay and Alcatraz and had breakfast thrown in for free. The real bonus for this hotel though is the spa in the lobby. It's a sleek, modern and relaxing space and the treatments were great. The staff were friendly and put us both at our ease. I finished my spa day swimming in the small roof-top swimming pool as the sun set over the city - perfect! All in all an above average property with some excellent extras and real value for money rates."

1,2071,Nov 24 2009 	Hotel Abri	My girlfriend and I had a great stay here. The staff and service were excellent. I'm all about customer service so I know when I see people meeting or exceeding expectations--which the Hotel Abri staff definitely did. The room was great. Even the maids were nice. This will be my go-to spot any time my girlfriend and I decide to visit the city. Highly recommend this place.
2,2071,"Nov 16 2009 	Perfect location! Great Hotel! Wonderful Staff!	My husband and I stayed here last week for 5 nights. We had an interior King Suite on the 5th floor. It was very comfortable and QUIET, which according to reviews I have read of other hotels, is not an easy thing to find in Union Sq. True to other reviews, the staff was FANTASTIC! The concierge, Hillary, was extremely helpful with booking transportation, tours, special arrangements, anything I asked. And the doormen/bellmen went above and beyond and make it a point to remember you by name. They all make an effort to be the best and it shows. And they have FREE Wi-Fi.....they get big points for that alone! The location was perfect, trolley, cable car turnaround, and BART are all literally around the corner. There is plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and a Walgreen's right around the corner for all those essentials you may have forgotten. There is an italian restaurant attached but we did not get a chance to eat there, although it smelled great and looked to be pretty full every night so that's a good sign. A BIG factor for me in reviewing a hotel is whether or not the beds are comfortable. If you've ever had an uncomfortable bed you know it can ruin a vacation. The beds here are outstanding in my opinion. Very comfortable and cozy. I gave the room 4 out of 5 because there were a few minor things I thought were lacking, such as no mirror outside the bathroom, and no full length mirror, and the towels, while they looked to be new, were not very soft. Also, we like it very cold when we sleep and the window AC unit struggled at times, but it did an ok job, it's not like it was hot outside so it was still comfortable. These are extremely minor things and it would not deter me from staying there again. I just feel there is a little room for improvement. Overall, for the price we paid we felt we got an amazing experience at Hotel Abri and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Union Sq. area. I walked down to the Westin for a masage in their spa and the lobby was so crowded and noisy, I was virtually unseen. I almost booked us at the Westin but after reading the great reviews of Hotel Abri decided to go with it......SO glad I did!"
3,2071,"Nov 13 2009 	Best service and value	We stayed at the Hotel Abri for 3 nights in the Urban Suite. We got a great deal on the room, large, plenty of space and was so comfortable we really felt at home. The service was amazing, nice and polite and would do whatever possible to ensure you enjoyed your stay.Abri is in a great location, a big Westfield shopping mall down the street and one block from Union Square. It's a great place to access transport and even has a cable car stop meters away. The area was safe, be aware that there is homeless people around, particularly around hotel's and food places (we didn't come across anyone aggressive and were all very well mannered).Hotel Abri also has a business center (meeting rooms, internet, printing facilities etc). We used the free internet access and printing facilities to plan our day and also to print tickets. I'd recommend asking the concierge to book a Go-Car for you as it's a great way to see San Francisco."
4,2071,"Nov 12 2009 	Beautiful renovation	I've stayed at the Hotel Monticello many times over the years, but the new Hotel Abri's renovation is the best I've seen. It is now sleek, comfortable, and elegant with top amenities. It is only 2 half blocks from the Powell Street cable car and the BART station which makes it an exceptional location. It is a close walk to the Moscone Convention Center and only a block from Union Square. It's also a block from the huge shopping center on Market that has Nordstrom and other great shops. The location can't be beat. The service was over the top - they even remembered our names after the first day. That's pretty amazing! The bed in our room was so comfortable and the work desk and free WiFi makes Marriott and other hotels who charge for internet look ridiculous. We had room 522 which was just fabulous."
5,2071,"Nov 3 2009 	Great Service Amazing Price	We spent one night at the Hotel Abri and would have extended our stay if we could. The price was great--around $90, I think. Upon check in we were upgraded to a two room suite on the interior of the hotel. The room was big, clean, and modern. Every time we passed through the lobby, the staff made eye contact and greeted us. This hotel is right in Union Square, but there was a doorman so we always felt safe entering the hotel late at night. I've been recommending this hotel to everyone."
6,2071,"Oct 30 2009 	Super outstanding staffs and Hotel!	We recently had the privilege of staying at the Hotel Abri for 6 days. We had a corner suite and it was simply amazing! The staff is very accommodating and the room was spacious and very clean, like a brand new, sophisticated hotel, and good quality bed and professional staff. The hotel provides the quality and comfort. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the San Francisco area. The hotel is in a GREAT location close to public transportation and most everything is within walking distance. If you are visiting the San Francisco I would highly recommend this hotel."
7,2071,"Oct 27 2009 	Amazing Staffs	Stayed here in October, and really enjoyed the hotel Abri. It was centrally located in Union Square, lots to see and do close by. Easy access to Cable cars and buses, BART. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. Just returned from a week at The Hotel Abri and can't wait to go back! We found The Abri online and actually found the lowest rate directly through the hotel's website. Everything about the hotel was superb - the price, the location, the cleanliness and comfort, the dcor and, most of all, the staff. We took BART from the airport less than $8 each and it put us within a block of the hotel. Although we arrived extremely early in the day, we were able to check in by noon. The best part of our stay at The Abri was the management and staff - always helpful, friendly and patient.We would recommend this hotel to anyone and we can't wait to return."
8,2071,"Oct 22 2009 	warm and excellent service. clean modern cozy rooms. seriously the staff is awesome.	So while i was researching for San Francisco hotels to stay at, I read the great reviews for Hotel Abri and I was very suspicious and thought they were fake. However, after my 3 night stay (then an additional one night stay after my overnight trip to Sonoma), I was a believer in all those great reviews. Hotel Abri is a great pick that I highly recommend (if you want to stay in the center of SF, within walking distance of tourist-y stuff).i had a great experience with Hotel Abri. there were some Cons though: 1. low Wi-Fi strength2. lack of 24-hour room service. 3. lack of counter space in the queen-sized rooms (we had room #509 our first leg of the trip, but the bigger room we were upgraded to--room #507--had a lot of counterspace for all my vanity stuff)what outshines these aforementioned and small grievances is Hotel Abri's stellar staff. A great pick that I'd recommend to a friend. The Hotel room photos are pretty accurate. And the inside-rooms are a little quieter (they pointed that out)."
9,2071,"Oct 20 2009 	Nice and informative staff	Nice lobby. Our room was a bit small, but served our needs. The staff was very helpful."
10,2071,"Oct 15 2009 	Newly renovated large rooms in Union Square	I loved my stay at the Abri - it's a great location close to all the shopping on Powell street (Forever 21, H&amp;M, Macy's) and they have done a great job with the rooms. Spacious, especially for a boutique with great modern furnishings. Definitely recommend and would be back. The staff is very genuine, sweet and helpful."
11,2071,"Oct 15 2009 	Great little secret!	Having stayed at the Handlery, the Westin and other San Francisco hotels, the Hotel Abri was a great discovery! It is located right in the heart of Union Square and has a great atmosphere. There is a lot of things on the doorstep of the hotel and the staff are only too happy to help you.The rooms are a little on the small side, but are compensated by a large bathroom with nice amentities (l'occitaine) and a room with great mod-cons such as ipod dock, plasma, complimentary wireless etc, etc.I found it so nice to be in a big city and still feel like I was at a friendly boutique hotel with character!"
12,2071,"Oct 8 2009 	Exceeded my expectations!	I found a great package deal for this hotel online. It looked like it had been remodeled recently, in a convenient part of town and was a good price most importantly. I hadn't planned on spending a lot of time in the room, so I wasn't dissuaded when some complained about the room size. I was pleasantly surprised! There was plenty of room...way more than I had expected. The room was really great - especially for being a remodeled boutique hotel. The area was great during the day; lots of shopping, easy to get to transportation if needed and restaurants in walking distance. Yes, there are homeless roaming the streets, and it might get a little worse at night, but you are in a big city and it seems to come with the territory in most places I go. They never bothered us more than to ask for spare change, so it wasn't really an issue anyways. Also, all of the staff were so friendly and accommodating! We arrived before 8am (waaay before check in time) and they were able to quickly find us a room, which i did not expect to be ready. They were also helpful with any questions we had about the city.If we go back to San Francisco I will definitely stay here again with no hesitations."
13,2071,"Oct 6 2009 	Incredible Service	It was amazing to visit San Francisco at Hotel Abri in the fall and enjoy the fantastic room, shopping, convention, restaurants and hospitality, for its price its like finding a treasure The hotel is an excellent one and we have experienced a nice time. Every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted with a homely reception. This was our first Abri experience and we were very impressed with the room, hotel and your staff. Indy Shrestha, hotel Manager was incredible and went above and beyond the customer service level. After long days and nights it was truly a joy to come back to the comfort of the room. Definitely, we will be back again."
14,2071,"Oct 3 2009 	Exceeded all expectations	The Hotel Abri has an excellent location just minutes from Cable Cars, Muni, Bart and Union Square. Not to mention right next door to the greatest little bar &quot;Puccini &amp; Pinetti. The room was very clean and well kept. But I must say the staff went above and beyond all expectations. They were very helpful,friendly and courteous. I would definitely stay here again on future visits."
15,2071,"Sep 29 2009	No car no problem - Great location staff and value	My brother and I booked two rooms for a two-night, weekend stay. The rates were exremely reasonable considering the downtown location and weekend timetable. The Abri is just around the corner from the Powell Street BART station. We traveled for a week in California using only public transit, so the BART ride from the airport to the hotel was simple and fast. The cable car to Fisherman's Wharf departs a block away, as well. And the Market Street trolleys are equally convenient. One evening we bought ice cream at a nearby shop and just people-watched by the cable car turnaround for 20 minutes or so while licking our cones.Great show! It's also an easy walk to shopping, Chinatown and other notable neighborhoods. It is undeniably an urban location, on the edge of some scruffy blocks. There's a popular nightclub across Ellis Street from the hotel, plus you'll find San Francisco's plentiful &quot;street people&quot; represented in this 'hood, too. Having lived in cities for most of my life, I didn't find this off-putting - just part of the local color. But suburanites with kids in tow might find that disconcerting. Most of the people roaming the streets, though, seemed to be tourists, not locals.. Check-in was friendly and easy. We arrived late after a long flight from the East Coast, hungry but with little ambition or energy for hunting down a good restaurant. We went next door to Puccini &amp; Pinetti, the restaurant affiliated with the hotel. It was terrific. It was crowded, with a wait for tables, so we sat at the bar and ordered wine and small plates of munchies, which came quickly (I had a very good seared tuna plate and my brother had one of their mini pizzas. Total cost for the food: Just $12. We spent more on wine than the food!).Our rooms were compact but efficiently laid out and stylishly appointed. Huge flat-screen TV, desk/work station for my laptop - the wireless Internet worked fine. Big bathroom with shower and very good soaps, lotions, etc. The queen bed and bed linens were extremely comfortable. The AC systems in each room are typical of hotels; not as quiet as I would like, but they cooled the rooms well. I always travel with earplugs anyway, so noise wasn't an issue for me.I appreciated the 12 noon check-out time, which gave us some extra time for a final brunch in San Francisco before we had to leave town. For the location, budget-friendly value, comfort, style and wonderful staff, I would definitely stay at the Abri again."
16,2071,"Sep 28 2009 	Great Location	Very well done renovated 1920's hotel. The location is perfect. We had an inside room that was very quiet. The room was big enough, had a new HDTV and a great bed. The bathroom (no tub) was large and user friendly. Everything the hotel provided was first rate."
17,2071,"Sep 28 2009 	Energetic friendly Staffs with great location	Hotel ABRI made our anniversary in San Francisco, excellent, excellent and excellent! We spent a week at the hotel for our 5th year anniversary in September 2009. And found it a very nice 4 star, modern and contemporary hotel to stay at with a great staffs. The rooms were completely re-modeled, clean and quite, (I had an inside room that faced the inner courtyard, an outside street room may have more noise). I had a comfortable Suite room. The best part is the staff, location and price, the ABRI is 1/2 block from Powell Street Cable car line (Direct to fisherman's wharf) and 1 block from BART. It is truly in Union Square with tons of places to eat and shop and all kinds of things to do around. The shopping is literally around the corner and is in walking distance of China town and the piers."
18,2071,"Sep 27 2009 	Fantastic Location with very comfy beds!	We were supposed to be staying at this hotel for 3 nights then move on to another hotel in SF for another 2, however because of the great location and how nice the hotel was we booked for an extra 2 nights! plus they honoured the discount we recevied by paying on the net. The rooms were well decorated, tv was huge, the bed was the most comfiest bed i have ever stayed in! the bathroom was lovely, new and clean. Complimentary freshly brewed tea and coffee was good for the morning starts!Location wise - this hotel was great for BART - 1 minute walk, Powel tram line 30 seconds away, Cable cars 1 minute walk. Union Square 1 minute walk!"
19,2071,"Sep 25 2009 	Lovely hotel great staff great location	we stayed in this hotel for 9 nights of our 2 week trip! The staff were so friendly and accomodating.The free internet in the lobby was really handy for booking day trips.We were upgraded to a corner suite over looking ellis steet, although you could sometimes hear people outside the air con disguised it well.Rooms were nicely decorated, tvs were huge and had all the channels.Bathroom was big with lovely l'occtaine products.Only downside to hotel was not having breakfast, but had a list of places that were nearby.Ate in Dotties true blue cafe and Cafe mason a few times, Massive portions!!Alot of homeless people in the area but thats expected in such a big city.Close to all amenities, bart, cable cars, street cars, westfield shopping centre, macys, union square (for bus tours) and everything in walking distance (china town, fishermans wharf) if you like hills!!!Cycled across golden gate bridge and got the ferry back from Sausalito (worth a visit. lovely scenery of san fran), the hotel has brochures with discounts for renting bikes and tours like alcatraz.Steaks in the daily grill were lovely and the food in the cheese cake factory (top floor of macys) was amazing.Hotel was perfect location and couldnt recommend it highly enough."
20,2071,"Sep 20 2009 	Great hotel incredible staff awesome location	The hotel has one of the best locations for vacation travelers in the city. Centrally located right next to the BART station, our trip from the airport was a breeze. Additionally, you are right around the corner from the Powell St cable car turnaround. Walk outside and jump on!The lobby is tasteful and hip. Sort of a laid back version of a W. Every staff person we encountered went out of their way to be nice and accomodating. A top 10 in terms of overall service.We had a suite, which was small, but typical compared to other hotel suites in SF. Spotlessly clean, with modern tasteful furnishings. Free wireless. Our ONLY complaint is that our room had the faint smell of Subway. There is a subway on the ground floor, and I'm not sure how it got up that many floors, but the complaint is minor since it may not occur in other rooms.This truly is one the best values and nicest place to stay in SF."
21,2071,"Sep 16 2009 	Some pros but plenty of cons	Pros - quick walk to Moscone; inexpensive; staff tried to be attentiveCons - many homeless people, who could at times be quiet aggressive in their panhandling, lingering near the entrance to the hotel; tiny rooms - very difficult for 2 people to stay in 1 room/nowhere to store 2 suitcases; noisy AC/lots of street noise (nightclub is across the street); cleanliness was marginal. Crowning touch was when I left my 4th floor room to check out around 7 AM and was greeted by piles of vomit in multiple locations in the hallway."
22,2071,"Sep 11 2009 	Excellent location comfortable stay great value.	We have a group of 4 and stayed in the Urban Suite (1 room w/ king-sized bed, and 1 room with sofa-bed). Bathroom was very spacious. Hotel is right in Union Square, so very convenient for shopping and eating. Staff are friendly and helpful. Nice L'Occitane amenities. The A/C was quite noisy. Hotel did not have extra blankets for our sofa bed."
23,2071,"Sep 7 2009 	Comfortable room in a great location	The Hotel Abri was in a perfect location. We took the BART from the airport and loved the short walk to the hotel. We had a Queen interior room on the fifth floor. Although the room was small, it was well organized, quiet and comfortable. There were a few downsides but we overlooked them. The wireless internet didn't work in our room and the high definition television worked but it wasn't receiving a high def signal. We used the computer in the lobby when we needed to look something up. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful but it seemed these issues were out of their control. We purchased a Muni pass at the information desk in the airport for our transportation. There is a kiosk at the Bart Station but we avoided the long line by purchasing the pass at the airport. The cable car lines were long during the day but we could often jump on in the evening to come down the hill. We took a long walk up to North Beach the first night and enjoyed listening to musicians performing in Union Square and on a street corner in Chinatown. We ate at Ideale Restaurant and loved it. It's near City Lights book store. We ate breakfast at Lefty O'Doul's a few blocks away. If you are a baseball fan, it's a fun place to check out. If you are traveling light, the BART service to the airport is quick, convenient and much less expensive at $16.20 for both of us one way. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely visit this hotel again."
24,2071,"Sep 6 2009 	nice hotel but not great location	Because the hotel is on a small side street, there are homeless people right outside the hotel. It's a bit difficult coming and going from the hotel with young children. A larger hotel has more entry space to control the sidewalk. The lobby was small and quaint. Our room was fine, the a/c didn't work well. We had a junior suite. The bed and pillows very comfy. The bathroom is great and the shower is wonderful. Bath products were top of the line. The restaurant downstairs was okay."
25,2071,"Sep 5 2009 	Staff was great!	I can't say enough good things about the staff at this little boutique hotel. They were extremely helpful and friendly going out of their way to make our stay comfortable. When we wanted to go to a movie, they printed what was showing at nearby theaters and provided directions to each of them. When we needed a happy hour recommendation, they did the same. The hotel does not serve breakfast, but their are so many places nearby, that it's fun to try other locations.We arrived on a Thursday morning and stayed for three nights. We went to happy hour on Friday night at the restaurant next door. It was very crowded so we took our drinks back to the hotel lobby and drank them in front of the fire while deciding where to go to dinner that evening.The hotel is small -- small lobby and small rooms. Two computers with internet access available in the hotel lobby for guests. I think there was also access in the rooms, but we didn't bring out laptops, so I didn't pay attention.The room itself was small but nicely equipped. The hotel is old, but well-maintained. Brown tones dominated the color. Big, flat-screen TV and in-room refrigerator. Standard coffee maker. Bathroom nice with bath and body works toiletries. Not much room for moving around especially with two large suitcases, but we didn't really need it either. Overall, highly recommended."
26,2071,"Sep 3 2009 	Great Location Great Amenities	I had read reviews saying that the rooms at Abri were small and cramped - this was not the case for us. We had a corner front room (a tad noisy but we turned on the air conditioner to drown out street noise which worked well), which was extremely well appointed and spacious. The bathroom was huge and equipped with lovely L'Occitane products (very good quality). There was plenty of storage as well, and the fridge came in handy for snacks."
27,2071,"Sep 1 2009 	Couldn't stay - but would have loved to.	After a long flight and BART ride with our 5 year old daughter, we finally arrived at Hotel Abri. Unfortunately, when we were checking in we discovered that my husband accidentally booked the Hotel Abri for July (2 weeks before we were supposed to arrive in San Francisco). They were fully booked for all the nights we were going to be in San Francisco, but the staff diligently worked to find us another hotel (not advised to arrive in San Francisco without a hotel reserved!). He also reimbursed us the $120 we were charged for not showing up on the first night. While we were not able to stay at this hotel, it looked beautiful and the staff were great. Location is great as we stayed a couple of blocks from here. Would highly recommend based on even our limited experience. Will plan another trip to San Francisco just to stay here!"
28,2071,"Aug 30 2009 	This hotel was great!	I loved this hotel. The hotel was an older builidng but you would never know it. It had been totally redone less than 1 year ago. I would classify it as a boutique hotel. It was very hip and modern but not too over the top. The furnishings in the room very very modern, including the 42&quot; flat screen tv. The bed had tons of pillows and also great bedding. I was upgraded to a King Room so that made my 5 night stay more enjoyable.The location was right off of Powell Street, so it was 1 block away from Union Square and right on the cable car line. I couldn't hear the cable cars at all.I loved this hotel, and would stay there again in a minute. One month previous I was in San Fran. and stayed at the Westin Market Str., but would much rather have stayed here on both trips, because of location, and the type of boutique hotel that it was."
29,2071,Aug 26 2009 	Great hotel and service; stay in interior room away from street noise	We spent 5 days here and had a great stay after first night. First night we got a 2nd flr room overlooking Ellis st and the Fusion Lounge. Loud noise until 3:00 am after bar closed and all the taxis and yelling stopped and that was on a Thurs. Next night we were placed in a very nice room; spacious for San Fran and excellent service. Would stay again. Location great if you want to be near all the transportation (Mkt St and cable car)
30,2071,"Aug 24 2009 	Fantastic Stay	We stayed at Hotel Abri for 3 nights and was very pleased. The hotel is very clean with modern decor. We were pleasantly surprised to have a bottle of wine with personal greeting on arrival to help us celebrate our Anniversary. We had a room with 2 double beds. Although the room was very small, especially with all our luggage, it was comfortable. Only down side was the noise from the street below. The staff at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. There was complimentary coffee in the morning in the lobby and the kids liked the free bubble-gum machine in the lobby too. Location is excellent. We parked in the parking garage across the street ($6 per night when your car is parked after 5pm and out by 8am). This really wasn't a problem since my husband is an early riser. Definately recommend this hotel!"
31,2071,"Aug 18 2009 	Excellent pick	Great location, attractive hotel, helpful staff - what more can you ask for?"
32,2071,"Aug 12 2009 	Great value for money	I stayed 2 nights here. I found the internet deal less than US$100 per night. Just behind the main shopping area so great location. Lobby is very trendy, the room was not as new or trendy look as the lobby, but for $90something, it's great value for sure."
33,2071,"Aug 11 2009 	very nice convenient hotel	This is the second time I've stayed at the Hotel Abri. Very clean (I think it was just recently remodeled, or at least it looks that way). The rooms are small and quirky, with funny little staircases, which is very typical of many older SF hotels, but I think it adds to the charm. The decor was stylish and modern. My room this time was a little noisy with all the street noise outside, but then, that's been true of every SF hotel unless you at least 10 floors up. My room was actually a suite, with 2 flat-screen TVs. The staff were all very helpful. The location is great: between Union Square and the Powell St. BART station. Tons of theaters and restaurants all around. And on top of that, I got a great price ($125/night during the week). Highly recommended."
34,2071,"Aug 9 2009 	This hotel exceeded our expectations.	My husband and I stayed at the Abri for our 36th anniversary. From the first greeting at the front desk the friendly staff gave us exceptional services. We asked for a quiet room, and got one. The manager upgraded us to a suite without our asking and sent us a bottle of wine for our anniversary, with personal greetings!The room itself was very comfortable, and had every amenity we could have asked for. We enjoyed the very comfortable bed as well as the two wide screen TV's. The location was perfect. We would definitely stay here again. Even though we don't live too far away, we really felt &quot;on vacation&quot; here at the Abri."
35,2071,"Aug 2 2009 	marvelous stay	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night, walked in without reservation 2 days earlier, the person at the front desk gave us the special internet rate (119$US).We had a marvelous stay and warmly recommend this hotel.Bernard from Canada"
36,2071,"Jul 30 2009 	A home away from home	Hotel Abri offered the most amiable stay imaginable. Their service is impeccable, the quality of goods (decor, linens, L'Occitane toiletries) is remarkable and their prices are reasonable. The rooms are more spacious than those I have previously encountered in the city and designed optimally. They cover all the bases and then some. The showers were more than accommodating in size and the sleep afforded by the beds is unparalleled. The front desk personnel particularly make Abri endearing. Every single person behind the front desk displays a sincere interest in knowing, assisting and interacting day to day with you. My stay had to be extended and Abri was already booked by that point, but I found myself missing the people and hotel so much that even afterward I was dropping in every opportunity I could just to say hi. Hotel Abri saved me on so many occasions in my trip and I will never stay anywhere else as long as I can - and neither should you!"
37,2071,Jul 28 2009 	Great Place but the Aromatherapy Smell Was Awful.	I thought the employees were terrific. My room was perfect and quiet. I felt safe and sound there. The amenities were good although the wifi was a little spotty at times for service. My only complaint and the only reason I would not stay there again was the overpowering use of a scent machine in the lobby. It permeated the lobby and elevator with a very heavy and cloying scent. Anyone with allergies to perfume would not be able to endure this. Thankfully the smell did not extend to my room.
38,2071,"Jul 27 2009 	Amazing Stay in Great Location	I absolutely loved Hotel Abri! It was located right in Union Square where I was able to get around the city so easily. The great proximity to BART and cable cars allowed me to explore the lovely city of San Francisco. Wifi and business center was complimentary. The employees were very friendly and helpful with that and one of their great employees, Indy Shrestha, quickly helped me set up my connection along with a bottle of wine and snacks. Beds were very comfy and the rooms had the latest equipment. Nice Plasma TVs and I hooked up my Ipod to their included docks. Overall great location and customer service that is sure to bring me back."
39,2071,"Jul 26 2009 	Can't Wait To Go Back!!!	My husband, myself and our son just returned from a week stay at the Hotel Abri. It was truly wonderful. We were in the Oasis suite which was 500 square feet of pure comfort. We had a separate sitting area with queen size pull out sofa and a separate bedroom with king size bed. There was also a small fridge. The hotel has a wonderful restaurant attatched which will deliver dinner to your room from a limited menu. Food was incredible. The best thing about the Hotel Abri is the staff. They couldn't do enough for you to make sure that your visit was a pleasant one. ( Richard, the concierge, should offer a course on how to be a successful concierge-- he was great! ) Very centrally located. Great places for breakfast nearby-- Dottie's Tru Blue Cafe was the best. Not in the most desirable neighborhood and always a wait-- but well worth it. Sears on Powell was also good for breakfast. No shortage of Starbucks near the hotel. The only negative , and nothing the hotel could do about it ,was the noise from across the street at the Fusion Lounge. Personally didn't bother me as I grew up in New York but may bother some people. Also, parking is $43 a night but that seems to be on par with the city. Don't miss the chance to stay here. You won't be disappointed!"
40,2071,"Jul 23 2009 	Great Hotel!	I would definetly stay here again! This is close to everything! Shopping,Night Life all within walking distance! The staff was great and always greeted you and was great with finding local spots!"
41,2071,Jul 23 2009 	Good value and great location	The Abri Hotel has a very good location near Union Square. It's easy to hop on and off buses and cable cars as well as the BART just within a block from the hotel. The room nice and clean. Internet was included in our price but the hotel does not offer breakfast. There are however a lot of good places serving breakfast nearby. We had breakfast at Lori's diner a block away and were happy with food and service.
42,2071,"Jul 19 2009 	Loved it	Great location, nice room, pleasant atmosphere. Street noise was just a bit irritating, but the location more than made up for it. We stayed for several days and could easily want or take public transportation to anywhere we wanted to go."
43,2071,"Jul 17 2009 	Best. SF Hotel. Evah.	My sweety and I had visited San Francisco for an overnight trip and decided since I found a shockingly great price for this hotel and knew the neighbourhood, I figured this had to be good.. Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel; staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell &amp; Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away.."
44,2071,"Jul 15 2009 	Location location location	The Hotel Abri has such a convenient location--block and a half away from a BART station, and half a block away from a cable car line. Plus, many restaurants are within a short walk. Puccini &amp; Panini, adjacent to the hotel, is a splendid choice. They serve the kind of food you keep eating even after you're full, just because it tastes so good.Now for the hotel. I could stay up all night trying to find a negative thing to say and still come up empty. The recent renovation has created a welcoming, cozy atmosphere. Coupled with a friendly, expert staff, and this hotel is right up there with my favorites. We stayed in an urban suite (which I recommend, because the single rooms are a bit small), and we had plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable. Free WiFi is a huge plus--chain hotels routinely charge for this. Rooms are beautifully decorated, and the hotel itself is so charming. Tiny, winding staircases are sprinkled here and there, and they connect the hotel's floors in such a charming, old-world way. The Hotel Abri gets an A+. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
45,2071,"Jul 14 2009 	One of the BEST	Best location, great room, excellent service...what more do we want!!"
46,2071,"Jul 13 2009	The Hotel Abri is wonderful!	Just returned home from a quick 3 night trip to San Francisco with my 18 year old daughter who will be attending college there in the fall. After much research, we decided to try the newly renovated Hotel Abri in the Union Square area. I've stayed at many hotels in the Union Square area in the past and I have to say this is my favorite and one of the best values! The staff at the front desk was very welcoming and friendly, the room was warm, inviting and very quiet, and the bed was so comfortable. Free WiFi. 2 large screen t.v.'s. Bathroom a little small but not bad - - loved that there were drawers and shelves for storage though. We stayed in an Urban Suite on the 5th floor on the courtyard side. The location is fabulous - - just a block from Bart, Muni, and the trolley, plus great shopping, restaurants and theatre within walking distance. My husband and I will be planning many future trips to visit our daughter when she's in school, and we will definitely plan to stay here again."
47,2071,"Jul 7 2009 	Great location near Union Square	This hotel is in a perfect location. Plenty of shopping places and restaurants nearby. Half a block off of Powell Street near Union Square and one block away from street cars and Bart station. You will not need a car to get around. Hotel and staff are great. Rooms are on the small side, but we only went back at night to sleep. I booked all of our tours online ahead of time and had no problems with any of them. We enjoyed the 5-hour city tour with San Francisco Comprehensive Shuttle Tours. We were also very satisfied with the Wine Country/Muir Woods and Carmel/Monterey Tour with Extranomical. The Alcatraz tour was better than I expected (you must do the audio tour). This was a great vacation for my husband and I. Coming from the humidity of South Louisiana, the cool weather was a pleasant change for us."
48,2071,"Jun 27 2009 	Hotel Abri: Super friendly home away from home!	With 91 rooms, Hotel Abri shines following its $10 million renovation. I came here for a conference and my coworker stayed across the street at Parc 55, also a very nice hotel but a lot more expensive. Hotel Abri provides cozy, albeit small rooms stylishly decorated in clean lines with a modern Asian flare. Rooms include huge flat screen tv, refrigerator, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, alarm clock/radio, air conditioning (which you seldom need in San Francisco). Room service is available. There is no exercise room but this is a city where you can do a ton of walking. My room faced into the courtyard so although we're in the heart of the city, it was quiet even with the windows open. Lots of great restaurants nearby and Hotel Abri provides a list of best breakfast and dinner spots. Larger suites are also available. The front desk staff was terrific -- very helpful when it came to navigating the city. I love this place. It's less expensive than bigger hotels and much quainter. Super place. Super experience."
49,2071,Jun 25 2009 	Brilliant location excellent room pleasant 	We stayed here on the first four nights of a 3 week trip to the States. We booked the suite through a room sale on Expedia and were definitely not disappointed. It had an excellent location and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.
50,2071,"Jun 25 2009 	Wow!	If you want to stay in a fantastic location, be treated with warmth and respect by the entire staff, and sleep in a wonderful bed in a beautiful room, try the Abri. That's what we did recently (based on the great reviews we read on TripAdvisor). Without our asking, Karen at the registration desk (she's wonderful!) upgraded us to a suite on the second floor. In our 30+ years of marriage, we've stayed in many, many hotels, but we've never had a better experience. We are recommending the Abri to anyone we know headed to SF."
51,2071,"Jun 20 2009 	A great find.. location service and room all exceeded my expectations	We stayed at Hotel Abri at the end of May for a weekend. Here are a few things that might help if you are considering this hotel. Getting there: We flew in to SFO and simply hopped on the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport) which takes you straight into the city. Hotel Abri is just around the corner from Powell St station, we were jet lagged this was a god send just how easy it was to find and the BART is by far the cheapest option to get to and from the Airport. The cable car line turnaround is at the end of the street and the the street car/tram/trolley whatever you want to call them right behind that. Transport was a breeze. There is a booth near the Cable Car turnaround where you can get a daily transport passport giving you unlimited rides on all the buses cable cars and street cars for 11 bucks. Hotel Check-in/staff: The staff were absolutley fantastic. Hillary the concierge was fantastic, its not often that you there service is so good that you can remember the persons name. There was a problem with our airport connection (we had a really early flight out ) and when they contacted the hotel through the night she rebooked our transfer for us so as not to disturb us. Housekeeping left the room spotless. The hotel is definitely well run. Amenities: No Gym or Pool but this didnt worry us at all there, is an adjoining italian restaurant which was delicious. Complimentary internet/PC use was so helpful. In room safe (many hotels are reverting to only having deposit boxes at reception - worth checking). Everything in this hotel was new - nothing dodgy at all. Room: The king size bed was divine, decent linen, funishings were new with a decent size bathroom - (Loccitane products). Room wasnt large but this is usual in nearly all the San Fran hotels I've stayed in. If you are a light sleeper they also have an inside room option it was nice to open up the window and watch the world go by outside. Noise: The hotel is away from the cable car line however there is a nightclub just across the road, and it did get a bit noisier on Saturday night, not from music but people out on the street. If you are a light sleeper take your earplugs or request an inside room. Shopping : Westfield San Francisco Centre is a minute away and union Square is just up the hill. No shortage of options at all. Food Options: EVERYWHERE catering to every budget, theres a cold rock ice-creamery next door too. yum. If you are looking for a nice place for lunch on a sunny day the I recommend the Cheesecake Factory on top of the Macy's building, it has an outdoor seating area looking down into the square. Great location. The hotel has a breakfast listing of the best places nearby to head out for breakfast - We went to a place a few blocks away called Dotties - food was delicious but get there early we were there before it opened on Saturday and there was already a line. The place is small and cosy but well worth a visit. The Farmers Market is also a great spot to walk through for brunch if your're looking for a gourmet biteBooking: I booked through expedia and got a great rate."
52,2071,"Jun 2 2009 	Amazing property amazing staff amazing stay	I work for a Four Star Property in West Hollywood, so I am very particular when it comes to hotels. And my girlfriend is even MORE particular. So my expectations were sky high when I checked into Hotel Abri. For those of you who haven't stayed in boutique style hotels in San Francisco, let me tell you that there are only a few hotels that are world class. Well, you can put Hotel Abri at the top of the list. The hotel layout and design was beautiful- modern and hip yet very comfortable. Many Union Square area hotels have smaller rooms, but the suite we stayed in was big enough to get lost in and had two great views. But the key to any hotel is the service, and the ENTIRE STAFF WAS AMAZING. From getting us on the guest list in clubs, to the bell staff giving us directions and recommendations, to remembering our names (and we remember yours Karen!) the staff has the customer service down cold. Larkspur Hotels always come correct (Villa Florence is great too) but I have to give the edge to Abri. I go to The City quarterly; Abri can count on me 4 times a year from now on.T-roy"
53,2071,"Jun 2 2009 	Wonderful Stay	I visited SF for first time and i choose hotel Abri and i couldn't have done better hotel. The hotel was convenient to the BART, trolleys, shopping, movies..you name it; perfect when i didn't rent a car. I got a great deal from http://www.travel-ticker.com/ $89 per night.I need a DVD player, which the hotel was nice enough let me borrow for a couple of days. I needed to order Chinese so i called the front desk. They were nice enough to print the menu of local restaurant which delivered and bring to my room.I requested a room on a high floor(3rd floor) and quite which i received. The room was cleaned every day and it looked cleaned. Downside to this hotel is that a club called Hotel Fusion Club is across the street so you hear people, car, police all the time on weekends but i was too tired to pay attention to that most of the time. I would have preferred a higher floor just to avoid hearing the noise from the street."
54,2071,Jun 2 2009 	This hotel is a great choice	Hotel Abri is centrally located near Union Square. I loved the room. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They were concerned about my hotel experience and VERY proud of their newly renovated hotel.
55,2071,May 31 2009 	Beatiful location and great rooms	We loved the location. The rooms were beautifully redecorated with fantastic beds and bedding. The pillows can never be matched anywhere. Our rooms were quiet and had double black out curtains. I found an excellent price on Hotwire's Travel Ticker promotions which allow you to select a paticular hotel. There is lots of shopping and a nearby trolley stop. I do not think you could do better.
56,2071,May 24 2009 	Great location beautiful hotel can not fault in any way	The location was perfect as it was as central as you could get! The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very helpful as well as friendly. The room was very comfotable and not small like most hotel rooms in San Francisco. Unfortunately I had the room next to the lifts so I could hear the lifts doors open and close which was quite loud so I recommend when you check in you ask to be in a room that is away from the lifts. Otherwise everything was perfect. The free WIFI was very convenient as was the free use of the two computers downstairs!
57,2071,"May 21 2009 	All the character of the former Monticello ... and more!	Rooms are snug, though we requested and got an upgrade to a King Suite at no extra cost. Just timing, I guess! Fabulous location at the end of the Powell Cable Car line, two blocks from Union Square. Was there for a convention at the Moscone which is two blocks away! A couple of decent restos in the area, but the onsite resto is pretty good! Front line staff is excellent! But, alas, we missed the nightly manager's wine reception which was a feature of the Monticello before it became part of the Larkspur chain and was renovated. The one flaw ... street noise through the window A/C units. And lots of street noise! Recycling bins being emptied in the middle of the night. Traffic. Shouting. Police sirens. I suggested they might want to extend the reno and come up with a better solution for A/C that will keep the noise under control. It's a shame to have an otherwise excellent boutique hotel experience downgraded because of this. That said, we booked while it was under reno a year ago, and by the time we arrived the price had dropped to just over half the original cost ... yes, we had to ask the question, but they were very forthcoming in adjusting the price!"
58,2071,"May 20 2009 	Modern Comfort - Reasonably Priced	I spent 4 nights at the Hotel Abri - 1/2 of the trip was business and the other 1/2 was vacation. The location of the hotel is excellent if you like to walk and/or take public transportation (which I do). It's a block from the trolley roundabout and there are loads of shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful - I was really pleased with the level of service during every interaction I had with them. I stayed in a suite and it was great. The layout made sense, the decor was modern and new and the room really comfortable. I did have occasional trouble with the in-room Internet access but it was handled immediately. It is a 3-star hotel but I definitely think that it's a good value for the location and amenities. I'd stay there again and I'd recommend it to friends."
59,2071,"May 18 2009 	Young Hip Friendly Clean	Great find in downtown San Francisco! Atmosphere is excellent - young &amp; hip. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms are a touch small, but extremely clean, with great bed, linens, robes. Would recommend to all."
60,2071,"May 13 2009 	Cool best awesome comfortable gorgeous value!	OK, so I tried to get a bunch of good words in there. This is a great find. Very urban cool without the gag factor. Staff is exceptional, rooms beautiful and bed extremely comfortable. I'm looking up the linens online! Puccini and Pannetti's, the Italian restaurant next door is one of my favs in the city, and my local friends love it too! Hotel couldn't be more convenient to everything, especially the BART/Muni station. I come to the city to see my college aged kid and he and his friends think this place is cool too!"
61,2071,"May 3 2009 	Great location great staff excellent service excellent value	We stayed at the Abri for 4 nights as part of a USA trip. We have stayed at several Hotels from Vancouver to Las vegas and the Abri was great. The staff couldn't do enough for us, the bar/restaurant next door is great value, especially at happy hour. The cable car turn around is around the corner and the trolley cars run along Market Street and the Bart station is less than a block. We left some property there and they arranged to have it forwarded to Las vegas for us.There are beggars outside but we found that all over San Francisco and no worse at the Abri, some of then funny to speak to and deserving of a dollar. Great spot, would definately stay there again."
62,2071,"May 2 2009 	Champagne Beds on a Beer Budget	Killer Bed!! Very nice sheets, lots of cushy pillows (and I bring my own pillow everywhere--but these met even my standards!), very clean duvet--not some moldy quilted job. My husband and I spent a night here in April and were very impressed with the remodeled rooms. Our suite had a king bed, plasma TV, and a very good shower. We had a small sitting room with a foldout sofa, fireplace, desk with WIFI hookup, and a small fridge...the rooms are funky sized but the building is very old so that makes sense.. I will say that our room faced Ellis street and a nightclub was directly across from our room--if you are a light sleeper be sure to ask for a quiet room. We were out very late so the noise was not an issue...Again--great room, great bed, great price!"
63,2071,"Apr 26 2009 	Loved this Hotel. Great room location and very friendly staff.	We stayed at the Hotel Abri for 5 nights and loved everything about it!! We booked an Urban Suite as we wanted the extra living room with the pull out sofa as we have two young boys. The main room with the King size bed is quite small however the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in so this more than compensated for the size of the room. The hotel offered free Internet which was great and the staff were extememly friendly and helpful. The location is great. Close to the main shopping area, Union Square, Cable Car and train."
64,2071,"Apr 25 2009 	Great location wonderful staff	After reading other reviews, we booked a suite at this hotel. While on the small side, it is understandable given that this is an older building that has been renovated. For the price and location, however, it cannot be beat. Very comfortable beds, clean and the staff is fantastic, catering to our every need. Get an &quot;inside&quot; suite and the room will be very quiet. Free wifi and business center and a restaurant in the lobby that was packed at happy hour."
65,2071,"Apr 22 2009 	unique boutique	This is a cute little boutique hotel that's centrally located in San Francisco. It's about a block away from the Powell Street BART station, which makes it very convienient. We took BART straight from the airport to Powell Street Station and saved a ton of money over getting a shuttle, taxi or renting a car and paying out the nose for parking.The rooms are quite small, but they are fairly well appointed with in room wi-fi, L'Occitaine toiletries, i-pod docking stations, bathrobes, and a large flat screen TV.The staff was very, very helpful. If you go, here are some tips:- if you are a light sleeper - request an interior room as the rooms that face the street are very noisy.- have breakfast at Dotties Cafe (about 3 or 4 blocks away) which almost always has a long line, but the food is absolutely tremendous"
66,2071,"Apr 9 2009 	Excellent	I highly recommend this hotel. The location was excellent, the room was lovely and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. The airline lost one of our suitcases on our journey from London to San Francisco and the staff at Hotel Abri could not have been more helpful. They constantly phoned the airline to check on the status of the missing bag and kept us up to date. They recommended where the best shops were to buy replacement clothes and generally could not have been more helpful. The room was lovely, huge bed, huge shower and huge flat screen TV. My only negative comments would be that the rooms they are a little on the small side and noise from the street below can be heard in the room but then given the very central location I expected this. Overall I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family."
67,2071,"Apr 2 2009 	Convenient Friendly Fashionable	I can't say enough about Hotel Abri. This was my second recent visit, and once again I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the size of the king room. The location can not be beat, big TV's and working desks are great, and if you want a gigantic room with a huge bathroom, ask for a king corner room - you will be amazed."
68,2071,"Mar 25 2009 	Good Hotel/ SF add-ons expensive	We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Abri- we liked everything, the rooms, the decor, the staff, and the location. I would recommend it as a very good place to stay in the Union Square area.My next question: How do you turn a 250 dollar, 2 night stay into a nearly 400 dollar stay with no effort? Answer- stay in the Union Square area. Parking was $42 dollars a night with an extra 17% tax on top of that. Also, there were several large taxes on the hotel room.Seriously, the only difference betwwen the agreed upon price and the much higher price was parking and taxes. I advise you not to take a rental car into the city and be aware that San Francisco is in the business of punitively taxing tourists (because those kind of taxes are easy to pass!)"
69,2071,"Mar 25 2009 	great location	great location, smallest room ever - literally the only thing that fit was a king size bed, cute furniture, but LOUD! we were on the third floor and in a &quot;quiet&quot; room but could hear every move from the people above us...didn't sleep very well. if you can sleep through anything then stay here. b/c the staff was helpful and location could not have been better!"
70,2071,"Mar 5 2009 	Ohh its wonderful between the sheets	We stayed there over night and it was very nice. Our plane came in at 11 and they were more than willing to accomadate us with the early arrival. The suite was nice and gave additional room for getting dressed and watching T.V. places other than on the bed. But the bed... oh my it was fabulous...we could not believe how wonderful it felt it was the bed the sheets, everything was so soft and it was wonderful. Book this hotel if nothing else to feel how wonderful the bed is."
71,2071,"Feb 8 2009 	Great time at Abri	Had a great in San Fran and at hotel Abri. It is a newly renovated, nicely decorated boutique hotel with a new name. The location is perfect if you're going for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Two blocks from the Powell BART station - the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) being a cheep (~$6) and easy way (30-40min) to get downtown from the airport. Got upgraded to a junior suite facing away from the street so definitely can't complain about the size of the room or noise. Lots of nice features to the room; possible to connect a laptop to the TV, play an ipod on the radio, free safe and wireless. They offer free organic coffee and tea in the morning and the business center is equipped with two computers and a printer available free to guests. Very helpful and friendly staff; gave great restaurant and tour recommendations. My only slight complain is the cellphone reception in my room. The room being on the second floor (out of six) facing the courtyard probably had something to do with that."
72,2071,"Jan 21 2009	Pretty Cool	I did alot of research before booking this hotel and am glad I ended up with this one. At first I was uncertain because my room-especially the bathroom counter-top and shower- had not been cleaned thoroughly. After asking the attendant to remedy this the guy they sent up still did a half-[-] job, but after I made my complaints known the room was well cleaned and tidied for the rest of my stay. I was also concerned about noise because my room faced Ellis Street but when I closed the window shade it really dampened out most of it, so it was no problem for me. The room was very comfy...great bed, and the bathroom had a modern feel about it. The downstairs lobby was great and the front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The price I got through the hotel website was actually pretty decent compared to most of the other places I looked at in the area. And, the location is great! I was able to get to Chinatown, The Haight, The Wharf, and North Beach all fairly easily by either walking, bus, or trolley car. Definitely would recommend the Abri."
73,2071,"Dec 9 2008 	Really Pleasantly Surprised!	I told my boss I was staying in San Francisco at a hotel in Union Square for $113/night and he looked at me and said, &quot;I'm afraid for you.&quot;You DO NOT have to be afraid of the Abri. The rooms are small (tiny, actually), but modern and chic. The beds are comfortable, even if there are about 8,000 pillows on the bed and you'll have to clear off most of them before you make room for yourself in there. Oh, there is no bathtub, if you care about that. The staff is friendly, pleasant, and remembers you. The coffee in the lobby isn't bad at all. You practically stumble out of the Powell Street BART station and you're at the hotel; it's also right by one end of the cable car line and the F line streetcar that takes you over to Embarcadero, where you can get the boat to Alcatraz. There's just about everything in terms of shopping--cheesy teenybopper accessories stores, DSW, Nordie's, Loro Piana--it runs the gamut.Overall, if you're looking for a nice sort of place to lay your head, and want to be sure you're not in the ghetto or the 'burbs, are close to transportation, and don't have to sleep on cheap scratchy flowered bedspreads, you're doing pretty well staying here.Oh, yes, and there's free wireless internet, which is, of course, terrific."
74,2071,"Dec 5 2008 	great service great room	Everything was taken care of... Although I was first given a room that smelled like an ashtray, I was quickly placed into a new room. The hotel is completely smoke-free, but apparently someone didn't notice that you would be charged $250 if you smoked in the room. The new room was great and a little larger. I had a 1 bedroom suite with a king bed. You can tell that the rooms have been renovated to look modern, but some of the old doors and trim remain, giving the rooms a unique feel. There are two huge flat screen TVs in each room, a very comfortable bed, and a great bathroom. The sitting room has a nice big desk, perfect for working, with a sofa bed, chair, and coffee table. I had no problems with the free WiFi connection. The service was fantastic. This place would be great for a business stay or for a romantic weekend."
75,2071,"Nov 1 2008 	A Great Little Find In San Francisco	We have just returned from a 5 night stay in the Hotel Abri, having travelled from Dublin, Ireland, and have only great things to say!Having reviewed numerous hotels on the web and trip advisor, we stumbled upon Hotel Abri and were impressed by the many favourable comments from other guests and decided to book it on the strenght of them.On arriving we were immediately greeted by hotel staff who were very welcoming and helpful. Belinda in paraticualr was a pleasure to deal with and made check in a painless process. Adam was always on hand with great tips on where to go / what to do.Our room was lovely, a seperate sitting room with bedroom and bathroom off it. The hotel has been recently refurbished and everything is clean and prtistine. The bed is nearly too comfortable!!The location of this hotel is perfect - right off Union Square and central to the Westfiled Shopping Centre / cable cars / bart etc. Its a nice safe area which helps as there can be certain parts of the city that it would be best not to venture to.I would highly recommend Hotel Abri and would definitely stay there if we return to this beautiful city in the future. For the price you pay you are gettting very good value for money!! Must also say thanks to Hilary on the front desk for all her help!"
76,2071,"Oct 21 2008 	Great service average room	Hotel Abriseems this was just completely remodeledpros:great location for shopping (union square) and transportation (BART, muni, F line, buses, plenty of cabs) and Foley's is nearby which has Murphy's on tap!great front desk staff from our check-in to our check-out, very personable and helpful, fun to talk to.beautifully finished lobby areacool toilet in room with half or full flush option, a great eco decision by themgigantic television in our room6 pillows provided, so you have a choice to find the one you are comfortable onnice shower, although no tub.cons: the king size bed and desk near the foot of the bed are so close together that you can barely squeeze by, the room is crowded and it'd be tough for someone to use a wheelchairthe windows look directly across to other windows of the hotel, you have no privacy unless you sit in darknessthe bathroom had no counter or shelf next to the mirror, getting ready was tough; however, there was a shelf closer to the toilet.no breakfast (although apples and bananas were provided downstairs, that counts for something for sure)as you walk through the hotel you can't help but think they finished the rehab quickly or carelessly... numbers on doors are crooked, things in our room were even crooked or not tightened (i.e. bathroom fixtures)"
77,2071,"Oct 19 2008 	Excellent	Hotel Abri (formerly the Monticello Inn) was lovely for my wife, my 3 year old, and myself. The hotel just reopened in Fall 2008, with redone lobby and rooms. Our stay--for four days--was wonderfully comfortable. It's near the end of the Powell line cable car and Union Square. The rooms are somewhat small, but well-equipped with flat screen TVs, iPod docks, and comfortable beds. The staff was enormously helpful and always attentive.An excellent choice in San Francisco."
78,2071,"Sep 29 2008 	Simply the best	The Hotel AbRi as it is now called is by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in. I have been here on business (Oracle Show) and for a small personal break and found the location perfect for everything i could need. The GM (Rob) runs an excellent show with good staff and a great service provided to the guests. The concierge (Hilary) not only arranged for all of my work needs but also made sure that my personal time was used well and provided me with any information and advice I could possibly want.All in all I wish there were more hotels as homely and superb as the now called AbRi. I cannot thank the staff enough for all they have done for me while I stayed in San Francisco, they have made my time here truly memorable."
79,2071,"Feb 25 2008 	nice little place	I stayed here only for 1 night on a business trip. Having never been to SF before, I can say that I did enjoy my stay here. We arrived a little early in the day and the rooms were not avaiable. They were more than willing to hold our luggage which was great. Once we were checked in, I found the room to be quite big. It is in downtonw SF, so it was a bit noisy, but not enough to want to be moved. I did not get a chance to eat at the resuatuant, so I cannot comment on this. However, we did make it for the wine tasting which was a nice added touch. The only real issue I found was that I was leaving for the airport rather early and asked if I should book a car service, which they recommended. However, the car service was expensive, and there were cabs available. Next time I stay here, I will be sure to take a cab instead.I would recommend staying here for a brief stay-over."
80,2071,"Jan 4 2008	Just everything you need	Excellent little hotel, ideally located downtown. Friendly staff, price is all right, rooms are quite small but not really a problem in SF (who stays locked in a hotel room when you are in such a stunning city?). The complementary breakfast is fine (provided that you like the black, hot liquid they call &quot;coffee&quot; in the U.S) and there is a &quot;wine hour&quot; sort of thing in the late afternoon in the lobby, which is really great. The only downside is that our first room was on Gery street (2d Floor) and we just could not sleep, given the strange, screaming noctambulous population of downtown SF (windows of the front rooms were apparently taken from the wreck of the Titanic and not insulated at all). We just asked for a quieter room the day after, and were kindly moved to the rear rooms with view on the courtyard (with fully insulated, new windows this time, don't ask me why). I wil ldefinitely stay again at the Monticello when in SF."
81,2071,"Dec 22 2007 	Magnificent Monticello	I booked the Monticello Inn for my family, after reading the positive reviews written here, and was very glad I did. Our suite was huge with two TV's &amp; even bath robes. The concierge went out of his way to get us on our city tour, as we were running a bit late. The location is superb with tram stops &amp; shopping right there. Everything was clean and lovely and I couldn't recommend it enough. Also the best coffee can be found around the corner in the Westfield Centre at Peet's Coffee...."
82,2071,"Nov 8 2007 	Perfect Location Very Comfortable and affordable	We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!"
83,2071,"Oct 30 2007 	Best Hotel Nicest Staff	My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon and cannot fault it. If you are staying in San Francisco you could not want for a better hotel. It is in a great location, has friendly staff and excellent hotel suites. We went for a meal at the hotel restaurant, which I would also recommend. I'm a vegan and the waiter went out of his way to make sure everything was okay for me to eat. He was also incredibly helpful with the wine list and the food was delicious. The little extras which the hotel provides also added to a perfect stay and all for a very affordable price."
84,2071,"Oct 17 2007	Wow	My husband booked this hotel online. I think he initially found it on Expedia. Seeing as he did the booking, he didn;t do my usual Tripadvisor research, so I have to say, given the price was $250 for 2 nights (very cheap by SF standards), I was a bit nervous.How wrong I was. The place is adorable, We paid a few extra dollars in the original booking for a Jefferson suite. It had a kig sized bed, separate lounge room with a desk, big tv (also one in the bedroom). I felt like I had stumbled into a secret place.Powell St Station (BART and MUNI) is around the corner, as are all the major department stores (which are open til 8pm).Downstairs (lobby area) there is a lounge with free wine and cake from 5-6pm and free breakfast is all included in the price.The room even had a fridge!This place is definitely on my list of places to come back to, but don't tell too many people, they may put the prices up!"
85,2071,"Oct 15 2007 	Perfect location in a perfect city	We booked the Monticello after reading the reviews on here and I have to say it didn't disappoint.After a long flight we arrived at the airport, breezed through immigration, collected our suitcases, jumped on the airtrain and hopped on the BART. Whatever you do make sure you do your research first, DO NOT be tempted to pay for a taxi from the airport unless you are staying a long way from any of the BART stations as you will be wasting your money! This hotel is located approx 2 blocks from Powell St station and the trip from the airport cost us $5 each (compared to the $40 it would have cost for a taxi) It really is so easy and takes around 30 mins.Check in was quick and easy and the receptionist couldn't have been more helpful. We had booked a Jefferson Suite and were very pleased with what we had for our money (4 nights for 330) there was a nice little lounge area with fridge, sofa, TV and a small desk, a lovely bedroom with a VERY comfy bed and HUGE TV and a nice, clean bathroom with lovely toiletries!The other bonus that this hotel has is that there is a complimentary breakfast every morning in the library and it really is good. There was a lovely selection of fresh croissants, muffins and fruit with tea and coffee every morning which set us up for the day.If you are staying for 4 or more days I would recommend a MUNI passport. We bought a 7 day passport each ($24 per passport) and this allowed us to hop on and off the cable cars and trolley buses as we wanted which was perfect when we became leg weary! We even had some frivolous trips to and from Fisherman's Wharf each evening just because we could!The only downside to the location of this hotel (and it really is only a minor point) is that there are a few beggars around and about but I have to say that we were never bothered by them and some are extremely talented musicians who helped to while away the time when waiting for the cable cars!One last thing...Make sure you visit TAD's Broiled Steaks, it's on Powell Street about 2 mins from the Monticello and it does the most amazing steaks, you won't be disappointed!All in all the Montecello helped to make our trip to San Francisco perfect and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone...Even my best friend!"
86,2071,"Oct 9 2007 	Fantastic central location	After reading good reviews,we stayed in 3 rooms for 3 nights for a short vacation. Very professional staff, knowledgeable &amp; so convenient to cable cars, BART, shopping. So many good eating places &amp; bar/restaturant right next door. Stayed in Jefferson suite with comfortable bed and pull out in next rm &amp; refrig too. &amp; each had its on TV. Free wireless &amp; continental breakfast (muffins, banana/apples, Starbucks coffee (yum) &amp; free wine 5-6pm. Many perks and our family of 7 adults &amp; 2 children fully enjoyed the spacious lobby. Hotel is so San Fran--not modern but clean &amp; toiletries were of good quality. Towels &amp; washcloths nice &amp; thick. Tub kind of slick, no bars to hold onto &amp; 2 family members slipped. Other than that, it is a great value though we paid higher price because it was a busy time. Didn't use valet parking-- very expensive &amp; we had oversized van..checkout other parking lots in city for lower prices."
87,2071,"Sep 27 2007 	Great Value	Stayed here the weekend of Sept 23rd, had a great time in the city,Room was clean and nicely appointed, Hotel service was excellent,They made reservations for us for dinner at a local restaurant for Sunday night while we were riding bicycles all day. I would recommend highly."
88,2071,"Sep 8 2007 	Loved the Monticello!!	Just returned from a week at The Monticello Inn and can't wait to go back! We found The Monticello online and actually found the lowest rate directly through the hotel's website. Everything about the hotel was superb - the price, the location, the cleanliness and comfort, the decor, the free breakfast and afternoon wine reception and, most of all, the staff. We took BART from the airport for $5 each and it put us within a block of the hotel. Although we arrived extremely early in the day, we were able to check in by noon. The room was a nice size, the bed comfortable and the linens very nice. It we also extremely quiet in the hallways - we almost never heard anyone coming or going and the hotel seemed pretty full. The restaurant next door was closed for renovation most of the time we were there but there is no shortage of good places to eat close by since we were only two blocks from Union Square. A great place for dim sum is just a half a block away and a fun diner is just up Powel St. The best part of our stay at The Monticello was the staff - always helpful, friendly and patient.We would recommend this hotel toanyone and we can't wait to return."
89,2071,"Sep 1 2007 	Great choice!	The Monticello Inn is an outstanding value!We booked a 2 room King Jefferson Suite on Expedia and paid only $104.00 per night. This hotel is located right around the corner form the Powell St. Cable Car turn-around and the Bart/Muni station, so you can get to practically anywhere in the city easily. The hotel is nicely decorated, clean, and well run. The bed was very comfortable and the suite even had 2 TVs, so our child could watch in her own room, which had a double pull-out sofa bed. If you want a quieter room, ask for an inner courtyard room.There is also free wireless internet in all of the rooms, as well as a computer and printer in the lobby if you need it, good for printing out boarding passes and such.There is an Italian restaurant next door with good food and a great kid's menu: your children can actually make their own pizza with their choice of ingredients!There is complimentary coffee and tea and a very limited Continental breakfast served in the lobby. If you want a regular breakfast there are lots of options nearby, such as Sears on Powell St., Starbucks, etc. In the evening, wine and foccacia bread are served. If you are visiting San Francisco with or without kids and want a comfortable home base from which to explore, the Monticello Inn is an excellent choice!"
90,2071,"Aug 21 2007 	Monticello Inn very pleasant comfortable	Although small, the rooms were very comfortable and clean. I especially enjoyed the comfortable beds and pillows. Each evening the hotel provides wine and coffee for hotel guests during a gathering in the hotel lobby. The morning continental breakfast was not out of the ordinary -- croissants, muffins, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, although it was certainly acequate. However, the hotel desk staff and concierge were extraordinarily accomodating and pleasant. Rates are good -- shop around as you can find differences of as much as $20/day. The location is 3 blocks from Union Square, 1 block from the Powell/Mason cable car turnaround, 1 block from BART. I would definitely recommend Monticello Inn!!"
91,2071,"Aug 8 2007 	A Great Location Staff and Accomodations	The Monticello was recommended to us by another friend who had researched it but had not yet checked in to stay. When searching for a hotel we were concerned with location to public transportation, an included breakfast and a quiet spacious room since we would be in San Fran for a week. The Monticello provided all of these things along with an evening wine reception, exceedingly friendly and accomodating staff who got to know us and regularly asked about our day or evening and whether we needed anything. We can't say enough about the location as we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) from the airport for about $5 each and came out 1 block from the hotel at the Powell Street station. The street cars, cable cars and buses are all within one block as well. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning which consisted of: coffee, tea, muffins, croissants, various other pastries, and fruit. The only thing missing was juice and/or water as there was nothing for non-coffee/tea drinkers. The complimentary evening wine was either red or white along with some type of bread. The room that we had was a Deluxe King facing a wall but was very quiet yet near the elevator. Since the hotel is on a busy street, I think that we benefited facing the wall. We still had three windows that let daylight in. The room itself was spacious and tastefully decorated with: a king bed, desk, two arm chairs and a small fridge. The bathroom was a decent size with a shower only. The free wireless internet and free lobby internet station allowed us to keep in touch and check-in for our return flight right from the hotel. Everything was super clean throughout the hotel including the lobby bathrooms. We laughed at how often we ran into a housekeeper sweeping the elevators. While here we have already recommended this property to several people who we ran into who were complaining about paying high rates at chain hotels. This was very affordable with their internet special combined with AAA. We would definitely stay at the Monticello again."
92,2071,"Aug 2 2007 	Unbelievable Lack of Customer Care	When we checked in on July 26, we gave them our keys for valet parking since this is downtown. On the 28th the staff brought our van to us with the back window totally burst out. They proceeded to tell us that this was our problem and between us and the parking garage. They did not even apologize. After the garage employee came he told us that if we didn't pitch a fit nothing would get done. I had a pretty big rant on the garage manager who told us it would take 2-3 weeks to get approval to fix. At that time we learned that the hotel had known that our car had sustained damage, but they had chosen to fail to tell us about it. We only saw the damage at check-out. I demanded to know why they had chosen to not disclose this to us so that we could get it fixed. They at first lied that they didn't know, but after the garage person said they had been notified, the desk lady changed her mind. When the front desk manager arrived, I asked him to refund us our stay because of the hassle this was causing us. It took me over 2 hours of arguing with him to even agree to refund one day. I am still in the process of getting the 2nd day refunded. The desk clerk reminded us that she had offered us a solution. The only solution she offered was to bring our vehicle with a broken window. It took them 5 hours to get our van fixed while my family waited in the lobby. They never once apologized until I told them that they had not apologized. I also said they could at least offer my children a drink. They never did. The parking garage manager actually wound up buying lunch for my family while the hotel only proceeded to make excuses and blame and deny that they did anything wrong. The bellman was the only one from the hotel that from the beginning said he was sorry, and he was yelled at by the manager to stay out of the matter. We were appalled at their lack of care or concern for our family. A minor fact...the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; consisted of only bananas, muffins, and pastry."
93,2071,"Aug 1 2007	Great location warm reception	I booked via website for the AAA price of $96 per night. This included a continental breakfast (apples, bananas, croissants, muffin, pastry, and coffee and tea) from 6:30-8:30, a wine hour from 5:00-6:00 with foccacia, and coffee and tea available throughout the day. There is also a computer and printer available for use without cost. Helen, at the front desk, is so warm and welcoming. I felt all employees were quite friendly and willing to help in any way. My room had a king bed, desk, chest with small refrigerator, nightstand, TV in armoire, nothing fancy but very comfortable. The bathroom was small, but much larger than ones I stayed in in Europe this summer. Location is ideal for anyone using BART or other mass transportation- a short walk to the Powell ST. station. There are homeless asking for handouts all over, but not unlike other urban areas, but didn't feel this detered from my enjoyment of the area. Be sure to check your invoice upon checkout, my second night was billed $15 higher but this was taken care of as I had my email confirmation with cost listed. I had reservations at the Parc 55 next door, but a local friend said I'd enjoy a smaller hotel more.... which I did. I'd definitely come back."
94,2071,"Aug 1 2007 	Terrific Location at the Monticello	For our first vacation to San Francisco, the location was terrific for getting to everywhere. My wife and I didn't want to spend a great deal on the hotel because we were spending more on the attractions so we got what we thought we were getting. We did have a problem with the lady at the front desk when we checked in the evening we arrived. Seemed surprised we had a reservation for a suite and almost made it seem like we would not get it. They also put another $250 hold on our card though we had already paid for the room. The in room &quot;bar&quot; consisted of two bottles of water."
95,2071,"Jul 19 2007 	Would stay Again - again	Monticello Inn was well maintained hotel. I stayed for a conference that was happening down at the Hyatt. I was able to arrange a ride to the Hyatt every morning at no cost.The hotel staff was friendly. However, there was some confusion with car service and check out times but they were quickly fixed. The room was small but functional. I couldnt see 4 people being in the room at one time. The hotel is on the cusp of the tenderloin so be careful when walking around at night. There is an excellent diner not far from the hotel. I highly recommend trying the diners in the area.Great place to say at a reasonable price."
96,2071,"Jul 12 2007 	Average	I stayed at the Inn during my vacation in San Francisco. The location was perfect as it was so close to everything I needed. However, the service was average. The front desk staff was friendly, but I didn't quit understand how the housekeeping work in the Inn. I was not happy the fact that I was waken by housekeeping at 1pm in the afternoon asking if I need service. Understood from the point that they try to get their job done, but simply leave a friendly note under the door will do just fine. I was there for the purpose of vacation!!The room they gave to me was a handicape room. It had the worst shower ever. The shower head was at my shoulder. The person who checked me in obviously see how tall and big my boyfriend and me was. Maybe she just don't like me? The room was located on the back side of the hotel, where the restaurant dump their garbages and empty bottles. The noise woke me up every single morning. It was very weird the time restaurant chose to take out garbages?!!I have worked in a four star boutique hotel and resorts before. From the way that the Inn tried to advertise itself online, the facility and service just not up to the expectation yet. Working at the Front desk, you need to have the ability to read guest's mind, for example: when see a guest who is tall and big, you should instant figure out that a handicape room with a double bed just wouldn't work. It's all about the details, and how you judge the situation. Anyways, I will still recommand it to others because the price is reasonable and the location is really great. Those facts sort of balanced out the service quality. If you looking for a deal and only need a convenience place to stay in San Fran, it's perfect. If you looking for comfort and great service, you might thinking pay a few bucks more."
97,2071,"Jul 1 2007 	Monticello Inn - TINY rooms!	Location was the best that this hotel had to offer. It is only a 2 min. walk from the BART stop at Union Square. It was also quiet, but that may vary by room. At 2 there were no rooms ready. We checked in again at 3:30 and were told they only had 1 room - 503. This room looked great - it was very big. Turns out that this is because it was a handicapped accessible room. This would be fine except the shower head was only 3 ft. off the floor and this would not work well for me even though I am only 5;2&quot;. Also, there was a loud noise, like a motor non-stop in the room. We were then given 501 and took it just to have a room at that point. It was SMALL! I could have washed my hair in the sink while sitting on the toilet (not that I would want to, but I could have!) The &quot;boutiqueiness&quot; of the hotel was also lacking. The white duvet and blue and white striped walls were nice. Otherwise, the place looked dated and a bit fleabaggy to be honest. Especially with our view of a delapidated building next door. The &quot;breakfast&quot; was some bread prodcuts and bananas. They constantly ran out of coffee and croissants. The wine reception was a nice touch, but very simple. The staff were nice but useless. Waited over 1 hour for towels one night before having to ask again and wait for them in person. Another night they could not give us soap because they did not know where it was (?!) For $95/nt in SF it was OK, but I was glad to only be there for 2 nights."
98,2071,Jun 27 2007 	Superb Location!	Great location for tourists. Really clean (if somewhat small) rooms. Helpful staff. Lovely restaurant / bar next door.Would certainly recommend!!
99,2071,"May 11 2007	Small but very nice	I stayed at the Monticello for 5 nights while attending JavaOne. This hotel was really great: - It's 4 blocks from the Moscone Center. I was able to walk to the center each morning and back each evening (as late as 11pm) - The have a complementary breakfast. It's not much, but there was always some fruit and coffee. - The hotel has good 802.11 wireless internest system which was easy for my computer to attach to and use.The room is small and the bathroom doesn't have a tub, just a shower. Still for what I needed, a place to sleep and wash up this was a great hotel for the price compared to all the others."
100,2071,"May 11 2007 	Nice Hotel and Good Location	For my very limited travel history and first time in San Francisco, I did my research and decided the Monticello Inn was the best choice and I was not wrong. The location was within a short walking distance to where I was there for as well as a major mall, drug stores, restaurants, bus, BART, and the famous trolley car. My room was on the top floor (5th) and it was quiet and clean. I wish the refrigerator was larger and more free TV channels. The bathroom is small but more than adequatet for one or two people. The wireless was great. Lobby is beautiful. Staff is very helpful all during the day. Continental breakfast could have more variety and I did not see any juices available. I think a updated list of local restaurants, drug stores, grocery store, and other shops could be provided in each room. I found the list in my room rather sparse. Overall I would definitely choose the Monticello Inn again if of couse that it was near where I needed to conduct my business."
101,2071,"Apr 30 2007 	a great stay	My husband and I were staying over one night in San Francisco. I had read poor reviews of my other selection on-line and got rather concerned about the choice. We booked the Monticello after canceling the Nob Hill. The Monticello worked out great for us. The location was perfect for the theatre, shopping and walking. The staff was very pleasant and we were comfortable in our room. The bed felt good after hours of walking. The wine social hour was available to us for two days (we left our bags there while we went sight seeing after check out). We would stay there again.The hotel is older but being run by Larkspur now; so expect some upgrades. Overall; peaceful, nicely decorated and a great find."
102,2071,"Apr 29 2007 	Loved the Monticello	I booked the Monticello because of their terrific rates and favorable reviews from fellow travelers, for a leisure weekend trip. I was very happy with the property and staff and would return.My three favorite things about the Monticello:1,) The location is outstanding. Near Union Square, the Westfield Shopping Center (Bloomingdales &amp; Nordstrom), cable cars, BART -- you can't beat it2.) The hotel is very clean. I'm somewhat of a cleanliness fanatic and wasn't disappointed. Yes, the rooms are smallish (typical for SF hotels, though) but they are very, very clean. Ditto for the lobbies/public areas.3.) The Sunday New York Times is free in the lobby (there was a big pile of them, not just one). Classy.Other mentionables -- nice bath products (Lather), nice staff (from the front desk folks to the maids and maintenance workers), and quiet. I saw other reviews complaining about the noise level, which I could see if you stayed in a street-facing rom, but mine faced the inner courtyard and was blissfully quiet."
103,2071,"Apr 8 2007	Fabulous. Large Room 5 Star Staff.	Quaint, typical, beautiful, older San Francisco hotel. The place was very clean. The King-King room (5th floor-524) was large, quiet and clean, and had a refrigerator, but no coffee maker. The beds were very comfortable. All of the staff treated us like they had been trained at a 5 star hotel. They were wonderful, without exception.. They served wine in the evening and a continental breakfast in the morning. The wireless didn't work in the room, but they had a computer in the lobby for our use. The rates were incredible, and it was only 1 block to the cable cars. We usually stay at the Marriott, but thought we'd try this place. I was apprehensive about a hotel that only charged $109. a night for a king-king room, which included parking. What a nice surprise. This was an absolutely outstanding visit. We will return."
104,2071,Mar 25 2007 	Good Value	We booked this hotel through priceline several years ago and got a fantastic deal - around $70/night. It's small and a bit faded but it had charm and the location is fantastic. It's a lot more fun than paying the same price or more to stay at a motor lodge on Lombard street.
105,2071,"Dec 26 2006 	Fading but still OK	Having stayed here 10 years ago, I was a little disappointed. Curtains in the room were shabby, front desk/bell service were mixed. Older furniture with poor lighting. Cleanliness could be better. Floors are creaky; bathroom is tiny. It's still a good buy at $107/$125 for a huge room with 2 beds a few blocks from Union Square. Someone still dumps what sounds like a truck-load of bottles sometime during each night. But the alley rooms are quieter overall than the street rooms. Continental breakfast was a little stingy but this is SF. There's a notice on the front window announcing change of ownership. It appears that Kimpton doesn't want to do the major renovation needed."
106,2071,"Dec 17 2006 	Once is enough for this hotel	My &quot;non-smoking&quot; room featured an ashtray and reeked of smoke, and I'd trade the honor bar for an in-room coffee maker day. Don't let them give you a room overlooking the alley-- the restaurant staff enjoy loudly dumping the glass recyclables into a bin there into the early morning.If a reasonably low price and convenient location is all that matters to you, you'll probably be okay. I won't be going back."
107,2071,"Dec 9 2006 	Pleasant boutique hotel super location	The Monticello is a charming hotel conveniently located in Union Square. The location is great - sites and public transportation are easily accessible and/or within walking distance. It's an older building but that doesn't negatively affect the comfort factor - beds and rooms are comfy, bathrooms work well, everything is clean and updated. Continental breakfast is convenient; though we never ate full breakfast (there are plenty of places nearby), it sure made for a great cup of coffee to go for our car ride to the airport. Lobby wine tastings and poetry readings are a nice touch. Very friendly service.My husband lived in San Fran for several years and he says the Monticello is a great tourist option. We would stay there again!"
108,2071,"Nov 30 2006 	Monticello Inn	I stayed here for a business meeting right after Thanksgiving. I paid AAA rate of $107/night + tax. My plane was delayed about 4 hours and I didn't arrive until after 1 AM. I called the hotel and they assured me the room would be held. I walked 2 short blocks from Market &amp; Powell to the hotel, after midnight and had no trouble, nor felt any fear walking to the hotel. Once I arrived, David, the night desk staff was very gracious and helpful.As other reviews mentioned, the room was small but not as small as some other places. I had requested a king bed. The bathroom *was* small, not even room for a tub just a shower. As I was just using the room to sleep and get ready for meetings, it was perfect. Internet connection was excellent both days. You do have to go to the Kimpton page to agree with the terms but then you get a small logged in window that you can just minimize. After that, open your browser up in a new window &amp; off you go. Only drawback is that there was only 1 electrical plug that I could find in the room and 1 of the 2 receptacles was for the lamp on the desk. Good thing I had brought my travel surge protector, or else I would have had to charge my cell phone with the bathroom plug! No icemakers on the floors, nor ice buckets in the rooms. I went looking for ice at 2am the first night, found a janitor who went down to the basement and brought me some ice in a large crystal ice pitcher! The continental breakfast for $6.50 is a waste. Save your money and eat at other places around the hotel. The wine at night is removed PROMPTLY at 6pm. They offer a Chardonnay and a Shiraz. All in all, a convenient, charming hotel."
109,2071,"Nov 25 2006 	Great location decent room	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Because the hotel is older, the rooms are painfully small, the price you sometimes pay for a hotel with a lot of character. However, the rooms are well-maintained and clean, and well-worth the cost--we paid $98 a night. The linens were good quality and the bed was comfortable. The lobby is beautiful. One major drawback was street noise, especially on the weekend and on Wednesday night, street cleaning night. I turned the air conditioner fan up to high to make white noise, so I only needed earplugs for Sat, Sun, and Wednesday. (My husband slept fine through all the noise except sirens one night.) Second, the wi-fi service in the room was slow and inconveniently required us to agree to the terms of use and go through two hotel websites (Kimpton Hotels and then Monticello's) before we could access the internet. It made us do this EVERY time we logged in, even if we had already logged in earlier that day. However, overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. The room felt like home and we slept well. The staff was extremely courteous. The location was great for touring the city and it was easy to find spots for breakfast and dinner. We loved Lori's diner, Betty Boop's Diner, and an Italian restaurant nearby."
110,2071,"Nov 10 2006 	Great location for Aging Hotel	Stayed 3 nights here while at a conference for work. Location a block from Powell St. Station is ideal. My room was much bigger than most, yet the bathroom was extremely small. Room faced courtyard which is great in this part of the city since I'd gladly sacrifice view for quiet. Rooms are looking a little shabby from age but bedding is great. The Monticello is definitely a step down from other Kimpton Hotels and is also reflected in the staff which seem much less experienced than other Kimpton Hotels. On the upside, I only paid $125/night through my travel agent which is a great deal in downtown SF."
111,2071,"Oct 17 2006 	Great location decent hotel.	When I checked in, I was in regular king room. Walked in and it smelled horrible (as if someone had just smoked a joint in it). After trying to bear it for a few minutes, I went straight down to the front desk and informed them of the problem. The desk clerk immediately upgraded me to a suite - no questions asked - and it was FABULOUS. Huge, two rooms, two televisions, quiet and very comfortable. If you are going to stay here, the suite is the way to go. Also, location is great. Walk out the front door, walk a few steps to the right, and you're on Powell Street at the cable car turnaround. Union Square is a couple of blocks up Powell. I would definitely stay in a suite here again."
112,2071,"Oct 5 2006 	Loved it!	I spent a week at the Monticello with my boyfriend back in July. I loved it, it was very reasonably priced and more than we expected. The staff was great, especially the nighttime concierge! Always offering free tea, coffee, and wine to us. They unexpectedly upgraded us to a suite for the same price, and it was very large and spacious. The room was handicapped accessible, so the bathroom was very large also.  The only fault I found was that the showerhead was awkwardly placed, but it still worked fine! And the tv was not really placed well, but that could be easily manipulated, and who goes on vacation to watch TV?  The location is very ideal. No need for a car, get a week long MUNI pass and map, and just take the busses everywhere! It gives you more of a chance to explore the city, and they go anywhere you would want to. (I suggest starting over by the Golden Gate Bridge, and then move closer daily, to prepare for being more tired.)Overall I was more than pleased with my stay. Great staff, very comfortable, clean, decorative, and secure hotel, great location, would definitely go back again!"
113,2071,"Aug 30 2006 	a very pleasant stay	My family and I, 4 adults, stayed at the Monticello Inn for 4 nights. We booked a non-smoking room with 2 king beds online throught the Monticello/Kimpton website with no problem.  The location was great. Right in Union Square, it was within easy walking distance of shopping and cable cars. Although we had a car, we could have easily used public transportation anywhere since it seems that most lines cross through Union Sq. The room was very nice. Despite the building's age, the hotel is well kept and clean, with comfortable beds and pillows. I was relieved that the room did not, in fact, smell of smoke at all (being a non-smoking room I expected that, but I'd been rudely surprised before). The bathrooms are small, but how big does a bathroom need to be? They had dispensers instead of bottles (supposedly to avoid the waste caused by amenity packaging) for hand soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. My only real complaint about the bathroom is the shower head was not very good Since we did had a car, we opted for the parking package which included valet parking in the price of the stay. Although we did have some trouble due to some miscommunication between the front desk and the parking garage, it was convinient to not have to look for parking every night. The downside to this is if you leave something in your car, you need to have them bring the car back up from the garage in order to get it. The staff were all very friendly and always offered directions when we took the car out. Unfortunately the continental breakfast was $6 per person, but the staff gave us very good recommendations for nearby breakfast places. Overall it was a pleasant stay, and since we could walk to so many places we felt that we got a much better idea of what the city is actually like rather than just hitting the tourist hot spots."
114,2071,"Jul 28 2006	Value Location and Great Service!	4 families in our party for a San Franciso-area wedding. I booked for 2 of us by checking the Expedia/Travelocity rates...then, took advantage of Kimpton's website guarantee to match low rates and top with a free room upgrade. We got Jefferson King suites facing courtyard...each suite is 2 large, high-ceilinged rooms with good-size bath and 6' tub. Tons of seating, honor bar mini-fridge, 2 TVs...amazingly comfy bed. Other 2 families in our group booked elsewhere for less square footage at twice the price.July heatwave, but we had A/C (admittedly, it struggled a bit for the 2 large rooms, but not uncomfortable.) Hotel is older, but has been updated with new carpet, paint, wallpaper, and upholstery...spotless throughout.PERFECT location...you can walk to theatres, Union Square, Chinatown, or Civic Ctr area...even Embarcadero. North Beach (uphill) is a little stretch, but streetcars and cable cars are within a block or two for Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Try Lefty O'Douls on Geary for a great hot breakfast under $7.Maids, concierge, desk clerk...even maintenance guy...all VERY friendly and just like family to us. Continental bkfst is $6.50 if you want the cereal/juice/pastries, but coffee &amp; hot tea is free. Free wine and focaccia bread from 5-6pm...even book reviews onsite each Wednesday. EXCELLENT service...I would not think of staying elsewhere unless another Kimpton in the same area if this one is booked."
115,2071,"Jun 29 2006	Great time at the Monticello	We spent 3 nights at the Monticello Inn and found it to be in a fantasic position, ideal for shopping, entertainment and transport links being a minutes walk from the bart station and the cable car turnaround.The rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Very impressed with the hotel in general and would definately book here again."
116,2071,"Jun 28 2006	Neither Best nor Worst	Stayed four nights at the Monticello early May. Found it to be comfortable and clean although a little cramped, but we did not pay a luxury price tag, so were quite satisfied. We also appreciated the &quot;view&quot; our room had over the central courtyard, it meant it was quiet and restful. The hotel is well located at the bottom of Powell, close to the Tenderloin, but we had no concerns, day or night and were never bothered by anyone. The bathroom was very clean with a full bath and good shower pressure. A well stocked mini-bar at reasonable prices, generous free wine tasting of an evening in the lobby and the staff were attentive and helpful. The Puccini &amp; Panetti restaurant next door is excellent. Would stay again at these prices."
117,2071,"Jun 13 2006	Location Location Location	My 5-night stay at the Monticello was entirely excellent. I appreciate some of the comments written by other guests about compact bathrooms or repainted decor - but I couldn't fault the cleanliness, or the size and quiet of our two-super-king bedded room. The beds themselves were extremely comfortable, the air-conditioner of the older-fashioned window type was efficient and not so noisy as to stop me sleeping. At these prices I didn't expect a &quot;view&quot; and the internal courtyard meant blissfully quiet nights in the busy centre of a busy city. Surely that's not to be sneezed at?One small quibble - trying to book by telephone or online with Kimpton Central reservations was tricky, the website failed a couple of times, and the telephone response varied sharply according to which operator answered the call - I recommend speaking directly to the charming staff within the hotel itself to make your reservation and secure the room - AND the rate - that you want. Certainly worked for me.Of course parking is expensive, so ditch the car - you can walk, cable car, subway or tram it everywhere from here, and see much more of this fascinating city in the process!"
118,2071,"May 31 2006	Not Really A Kimpton Hotel - Surely	We stopped at the Monticello Inn on the last leg our vacation which had seen us stay at 9 hotels during the last month. We had chosen this hotel due to its location and the fact we felt reasurred that Kimpton group hotels are normally of a high standard. Unfortunately we were tought a lesson on this occasion. We were impressed with the lobby and public areas, when we got to our room it was horrible. We had a window which looked out on a disgusting square in the centre of the hotel as did most of the other rooms. The windows were filthy. The bathroom was tiny and instead of the usual high quality toiletries offered, these had been replaced by horrible dispensers. The walls were paper thin as we discovered when listening to our neighbors 'been intimate' (which incidentally was quite a good a show)!!The rooms were also very small, the bed was uncomfortable and creaky.We also didnt like the position of the hotel straight outside the lobby was normally beggars. We wished we stayed at Fishermans Warf with the other tourists."
119,2071,"May 17 2006	RUN DOWN HOTEL	Yes, this hotel is in a great location, but beware of a hotel that is long overdue for a rehab. At first the lobby is very nice, so you expect the room to be nice, but when we walked in the room you could smell mold. The carpet needs to be replaced and the walls have been painted over many times. The A/C is a small unit in a window of the bedroom which does not cool down the living room. I left the A/C unit on to keep the room cool, but the staff turns it off after they clean, so when you get back to your room after a long day the room is hot and smells. The bathroom is very small and needs to be re-done. The sink is 6 inches away from the toilet. I know the hotel is an old building, but put a little money into your rooms to make them half way decent. I dont know what others saw in this hotel!"
120,2071,"Apr 26 2006	Love the Monticello!!!	We just returned from a long weekend at the Monticello Inn. This is our second stay at this lovely little hotel. We love the homey atmosphere and gracious staff. The service is wonderul. The new pillow top beds are very comfortable. The rooms are clean and well maintained for an older hotel. Mini bars are well stocked and extras like irons and ironing boards are nice to have. We stay in the city several times a year, and have stayed in every major hotel. We really appreciate the service of this small hotel. We love this wonderful hotel and will return every time we go to the city."
121,2071,"Mar 28 2006	Wonderful Location and Room	I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Monticello Inn for a long weekend in San Francisco. Having stayed within the Kimpton chain in San Francisco previously, I had a high expectation for service that was met by all staff members I came in contact with.When I arrived, I was immediately greeted at the door and they made quick arrangements for my car to be parked (note that parking is $33 per day plus tax, which I knew about before hand and chose to pay on this trip). Since I arrived around 1 pm, I did not expect my room to be ready, but it was! This was an added bonus.I had reseved a king room with a AAA rate, but was upgraded to a suite. The suite was on the 4th floor facing the courtyard and was great. It was two rooms, with an incredibly comfortable bed and a nice sitting area in the &quot;living room&quot;. The hotel also has free wireless internet access throughout as well as complimentary coffee service in the morning and a wine reception in the afternoon.The Monticello's location cannot be beat. My wife and I love walking around San Francisco, and from its location a block from the cable car terminus at Powell and Market, it cannot be beat.We did not try the restaurant at the hotel, but the menu and decor looked very nice."
122,2071,"Feb 15 2006	Great Location and Friendly Staff	My Fiance and I stayed at the Monticello Inn from Feb 11-13 and have nothing but good things to say about it. We had purchased the room on Hotwire.com and were a bit apprehensive as we had never stayed at a Kimpton Hotel before, but were very pleased. You can't beat the location... on the corner of Ellis and Powell which is literally a 30 sec walk to the cable cars (which are $5 per trip). The old-fashioned trolley cars are around the corner also a must and much cheaper at $1.50 (which includes a transfer good on any lines for 3 hrs).The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful (especially when we had to extend our stay by one night due to my fiance getting food poisioning). And the hotel was suprisingly quite, even though we were right in the heart of the city. Ask for a courtyard room if you can, we had one the first night and it was great. No noise at all, but you do lose out on any view. The only problem with the rooms was the size... but it is a boutique hotel.Another perk of the hotel is their complimentary wine-tasting every night from 5-6. The best part is you are able to take it with you to your room to sip while watching the early news! As for their contential breakfast at $6.00 - not really worth it as there are tons of bakerys and coffee shops in the neighbourhood where you can get the same stuff for half the price.Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and would recommed it for anyone looking for great value and fantastic quality right in one of the greatest shopping meccas of the USA!"
123,2071,"Dec 6 2005	Very good - will return	I stayed at the Monticello for 4 nights in November. I was quite pleased and plan to stay there again. On the plus side:1. Excellent downtown location.2. Extremely close to all forms of public transportation.3. Good restaurants and shopping nearby.4. My king room was very comfortable and quiet. If this important to you, ask for an inside (courtyard) room if one is available. Bed, linens, bath, etc. excellent. Tourists and residents alike know that this area of SFO is very noisy. Coming back to my room was like visiting a private oasis of cushy silence.5. No hitches with reservations, requests, etc.Some parts of the hotel could use a bit of renovation touch-up...paint here and there, door frames, wear &amp; tear, carpet edges, etc.I didn't try the continental breakfast (minimal extra charge) but the set up looked nice.The hotel doesn't have a pool, fitness club, etc. if that's what you're looking for. They do, however, arrange for in-room yoga, massage, beauty facials, etc. for rather high prices.A very nice, comfortable stay overall."
124,2071,"Dec 5 2005	Monticello In - Great location	We selected the Monticello on the basis of our research on the Internet and in particular for its location to the BART. This enabled us to travel from the San Francisco International Airport to within about 150yds of the hotel. When we walked up the ramp from the BART to the the end of Powell Street we were blown away as it was our first time in San Francisco and with the cable car in front of us it was like being in a postcard. We also used Google Earth to check out its location within the city and its closeness to other facilities.The hotel was most acceptable given that we didn't want to spend our limited funds on expensive accommodation. Its location is superb. The hotel is an old hotel that has been refurbished but I wouldn't say modernised but it is clean and the staff are very friendly. The rooms are rather small but that didn't bother us as we spent most of our time out looking around the city. It is near to the corners of Market &amp; Powell Streets which gives you immediate access to the cable car terminus, trams to the Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square and Maceys, The BART terminus and there are plenty of tourist shops and food stores nearby.If we went again we would definitely ask for a courtyard room because the noise on the street side rooms was terrible. We were jet-lagged after a trip from Australia so needed some good sleep but it was just not possible in the room we were in. So with that proviso we would definitely return."
125,2071,"Nov 16 2005 	WIll Be Returning to the Monticello	I travel to San Francisco on business every few months and am always looking for a better hotel deal. SF hotels are across the board on price and quality and you quickly learn that a higher price does not necessarily mean a nicer hotel or location. The Monticello Inn is well-located for tourists and business travelers alike: less than two blocks from Union Square and less than a block from the SF Mall (Nordstrom's, etc.), BART station, and several good restaurants, five to ten minute cab ride from civic center plaza or the business district.One of the biggest pluses of the Monticello (for those of us who like to have our best friends with us) is that they accept dogs (I believe the entire Kimpton chain accepts dogs). I arrived with my three 50+ pound dogs - no problem. At check-in the clerk even offered a free upgrade to a suite so that I could have more room for the dogs. Incredible; very appreciated. The suite was spacious, nicely decorated, very clean. After reading reviews here I requested an inside room and it was nice and quiet though the view is of the air vents.Staff was very friendly and always greeted my dogs as well as me.Continental breakfast in the morning for $6.50 is a true &quot;continental&quot; - just coffee, juice, muffins and fruit. I prefer more substance. Valet parking with in and out privileges for $29 is very reasonable for SF. Only complaint would be that valet was slow in retrieving car when I wanted it. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here again myself very soon."
126,2071,"Sep 27 2005	Excellent value	I really enjoyed The Monticello and would have no hesitation of staying there again. I had one of the Jefferson suites and found it to be very comfortable and homey. Ask for a view of the interior courtyard as there was absoultely no noise. Best things about this hotel: the service, the beds and the location. Worst things about this hotel: could not find anything. Enjoy this great value hotel."
127,2071,"Sep 18 2005 	Great place to stay in the center of SF	Not much to add to the previous reviews:A great location (BART, cable car, everything...)...nice decor...clean and pleasant rooms...friendly staff...wine reception...breakfast if needed (note that there are also many Starbucks around)...free wireless internet and newspaper.Not really negative points but be aware of:Rooms towards front will be noisy...rooms towards the back are absolutely quiet but the view of brick walls is somewhat depressing...low shower pressure...why no pictures on the wall?Advice: we got the Monticello for an amazing price in a package deal with Expedia."
128,2071,"Sep 15 2005	Monticello Inn Was a Pleasant Stay	I traveled to San Francisco with my sister who was attending a business convention at the Marriott. This little boutique hotel was quite charming and very close to the public transportation I chose - the BART station for to and from the SFO airport, and the cable cars for to and from the wharf areas. Very clean room and bath. We were not able to attend their wine reception one night, and a nice man on staff was able to produce a glass for each of us. They provided continental breakfast vouchers for us. This proved a great time saver for us on the days that we just wanted to get out and get started on our sightseeing days. It was very handy to grab a muffin, croissant, juice and coffee as we hurried out for our busy days. I did not dine at the restaurant on site, nor did we order room service. There is a Subway sandwich shop right next door. Very close proximity to Union Square shopping - which can be a good or bad thing! I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
129,2071,"Sep 6 2005	I would definately stay there again!	Great location, clean, sophisticated hotel, and good quality bed and professional staff. The hotel provides the quality and comfort. Definately a good place to stay!"
130,2071,"Aug 31 2005 	Excellent Service -Average Accommodations	We just returned from a week in San Francisco. We chose the Monticello based primarily on Kimpton's pet friendly policies and the hotel's proximity to the Moscone Convention Center. We were graciously welcomed and our little dog developed a huge fan club. The front desk staff consistently went above and beyond the normal 3 star call of duty by providing us with directions - calling cabs - giving us restaurant recommendations and helping with reservations. They were also great about keeping our cell phone number on hand just in case our little dog got distressed and started barking or something during the few occassions we left him alone in the room. The room was average - nothing special though. We booked a Jefferson suite, so it was nice to have the extra space. The bathroom was a little worn and could use some updating, but it was clean and well kept during the course of our visit. I can't say I'm a big fan of the dispensers for soap and shampoo and whatnot, but I'm sure that the environment is (at least that's what the little sign said.) The only problem (and I can't say that it was an insignificant one) that we had with our room was street noise. We were on the second floor (the only pet friendly floor) and the noise was pretty bad. Being near an intersection, we heard a lot of sirens and brakes squealing. Every morning around 3 a.m., the street sweepers and trash trucks came through. The staff was apologetic and we realized, of course, that it was out of their control. They could not move us to another floor because of the dog and all of the inside rooms were already booked, so we made the best of it. Thankfully, we always travel with a white noise machine and that helped somewhat. We would definitely consider staying at the hotel again, but next time we would specify that we wanted a room as far away from the street as possible."
131,2071,"Jul 20 2005	Great location good value	My husband and I stayed at the Monticello Inn for four nights while on our honeymoon. The staff was friendly and always helpful. The rooms were small but clean. The breakfast was horrible (toast and coffee, some mornings there were small muffins and old bananas) and we wouldn't recommend paying for breakfast. The location is great for shopping, eating and site-seeing, especially if you're getting around the city on foot or by cable car."
132,2071,"Jul 17 2005 	A Hidden Gem	I stayed at the Monticellno Inn for 4 nights for a big conference that took up over 50% of hotels in San Francisco. This hotel was not my original choice. My office booked this hotel for me because my three hotel preferences were sold out (Hotel Monaco, Grand Hyatt, W). I kept an open mind upon check in. The hotel just completed renovation in all rooms. I had a suite on the top floor. It was nicely decorated, stocked with a good variety of magazines, and the staff was very pleasant. There was some steet noise but I did not have trouble sleeping. The showerhead is the &quot;water saver&quot; model that could use more pressure and water volume. The complimenary wireless internet was convenient and worked well. There was no coffee maker in the room, but I was able to get good fresh coffee from the lobby every morning. The public areas have new furnitures, comfortable and inviting, and were kept cleaned at all times. Liked the free newspaper in the lobby (San Francisco Chronicle, Financial Times, The Examiner). The afternoon wine hour was a very nice touch and enjoyable. Requested wake up calls every day, but only received 2 calls out of the 4 requests. I used the bedside alarm clock as a back-up so it worked out fine. The valet parking at $30 per day is reasonable when compared to other nearby hotels that charge $35 and up. The $6.50 continental breakfast was convenient at the hotel library lounge, which is a more pleasant place to have breakfast than the noisy crowds and dirty tables at Starbuck or greasy diners. The location is one of the best, cable car around the corner, and walking distance to the Moscone center and shops. Special acknowlegement goes to Ms. Tammy Tran for the great renovation, and Ms. Cue Li of taking care of my accommodation request. The Monticello Inn is a hidden gem and I highly recommend it if you don't need to be in a &quot;name brand&quot; and/or &quot;trendy&quot; hotel and you enjoy an inn that offers an unassuming ambience, quiet elegance with early American charm."
133,2071,Jun 25 2005	Great location 	I stayed at the Monticello based on reviews from Trip Advisor. I was a bit concerned that the reviews varied but I couldn't beat the price of $109US per night. The reviews probably vary becauase the room are most definitely 'tired'. But they are clean and attractive. The location is unbeatable. Minutes to Union Square &amp; around the corner from the trolly &amp; BART (30minutes directly to the airport - unbelievable $$savings!!). The corner room I got was twice the size of the pictures posted here &amp; the shampoo/conditioner/soap were high quality. Staff were very friendly - I never waited for service - early check-in/late check-out &amp; they stored our bags while we were out of the room but not yet ready for our flight. The $6.50 per room! breakfast was well worth it for a quick morning snack. Much more affordable than the greasy $20 diner breakfast around the corner. My biggest complaint was that the air conditioning didn't work. HOWEVER - I was advised that the entire hotel would have new units by Aug05. Once that's updated I would definitely choose the Monticello.
134,2071,"May 31 2005	Great Location Decent hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Monticello Inn for two nights from May 28-30 (Memorial Day weekend). I paid $107 a night for a queen-bed room. we got a free upgrade to a king-bed. Great Location - 1 block from Union Square, close to the Cable car, bus line, restaurants, shopping areas. The room was small, but thats OK since we hardly spent any time indoors (except for sleeping and showering). The room had a peculiar odour too. The room AC took a long while to cool the room. The bathrooms are small. No coffee maker in the room. There was no street noise. The hotel provides breakfast for a nominal fee, but we preferred Subway (right next door) and starbucks (one block away). The hotel staff is friendly and very courteous. Hotel provides valet parking for $30 a day (quite expensive). All in all, this is a decent place to stay if you are going to be visiting SFO for a few days."
135,2071,"May 17 2005	Beautiful simplicity	We have stayed here for two nights when attending my brother-in-law's wedding. The wedding itself was in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, but I booked the Monticello as it had better reviews and I had a corporate discount. And it was about five minutes from the wedding location on foot.The location is excellent, and compared to other hotels, the noise level was lower, as it is off Powell Street (one block). Now, if you are living in the suburbs and never had a chance to get used to city environment, you might have trouble falling asleep as San Francisco IS a noisy city. We had another couple with us staying at the same hotel for the wedding, and they had sleep trouble, never having lived in a city.The hotel itself is VERY charming and the decor is really nice. I never quite understood complaints about small bathrooms or not being able to see television from the bed...I do not like chain hotels, I grew up poor, and this hotel reminded me some of the grand old hotels in my hometown in Central Europe. Yes, the rooms are small, and the bathrooms have some cracks and the paint might be chipped, but really...does this mater when you are sightseeing all day and you get to your room at oh-dark-thirty at night, ready to collapse? The furnishings might have been old, but everything was spotless clean.The staff was very, very accomodating. When after the wedding, we were in a crunch for time, and my husband realized that we could not return the rented tails he wore, the hotel staff offered to help us out and returned it that afternoon.The breakfast is $6.50 per room, not per person, and as such, is a really good value in the Union Square area of the town. Good croissants, orange juice and strong coffee, and the muffins were nice and fresh as well.The only thing we winced about was the valet parking price...but again, when remembering that this is San Francisco downtown, it's understandable.We will definitely stay here again when visiting."
136,2071,"May 8 2005	Monticello Inn-A great place to stay	We found the Monticello Inn a great place to stay in San Francisco. The location is excellent - near Union Square, just around the corner from the cable car turnaround (be sure to ride holding on to the side, it's more fun than you'd imagine), BART and the tram to Fisherman's Wharf. The staff was friendly and accomodating, to the extent that when we registered they brought each of us a glass of wine since we had missed the wine reception.The rooms are small but comfortable, with very nice beds and linens. We'd certainly stay here again."
137,2071,"Apr 12 2005	okay stay	My husband and I went up to the city for a one night stay. We searched on line for something close to Union Square, but not too expensive. We booked on the hotel's website for a breakfast package for $149 which included breakfast and parking. However, upon checkout, we were told that parking and breakfast were not included. They comped us the breakfast for a whopping $6.50 which is an outrageous price for croissants and muffins, coffee and juice. Checkout was not the right time to find out that they weren't going to pay for parking. Parking was $30. The total bill with tax and everything ended up being $200. This was not a $200 hotel!The location was GREAT! Couldn't be more convenient to Union Square. Right next to the cable car. Easy to get a cab. Just perfect location.The room itself was HUGE, but very poorly laid out. It was very difficult to watch TV from the bed, but impossible to watch it from the chairs. We had to sit on the bed in order to watch it. We couldn't lie in bed and watch TV. The bathroom was terribly tiny with barely enough room to turn around in. It is an eco-friendly hotel. So, everything was in dispenser's. Soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. I understand and am thrilled with this concept as it isn't so wasteful. However, the dispenser's didn't work that well. You either got a lot or a little, but never the right amount. If location is the most important thing to you, this is the place to stay, but that's the only reason."
138,2071,"Mar 17 2005 	Nice hotel; good location	I stayed one night at the Monticello Inn in March 2005. The hotel was nicely decorated and gave the impression of a charming old inn. Pulling up out front for valet parking was crowded. Valet kept our car directly under the hotel which was very convenient. The morning continental breakfast for $6.50 was good but some hotels offer this for free. The room had a few problems: there was not a desk for my computer when using the internet connection, so I used the bed as a make-shift desk; the bathroom sink smelled like moldly laundry, although it appeared to be clean; the conditioner pump in the shower was empty, which I discovered while in the shower when I REALLY needed it; the &quot;touch&quot; lamp near the bed kept going on and off; the lights dimmed when more than one electrical device was being used. The room was moderately quiet but you could hear street noise. NOTE: For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, all hotel rooms will be noisy to some extent, even when they advertise quiet rooms. I have never stayed at one where I did not hear street noise. This is a big city with old buildings and even new, double paned windows will let noise through. If any noise bothers you, then either don't stay in the City or ask for an inner, no view room which may help. The location was awesome within walking distance to many things. I would stay again but prefer a hotel with a more modern feel."
139,2071,"Mar 4 2005 	Great Location; Good Price	Stayed there for a week in February 2005 during a business trip. The location is wonderful. You're within easy walking distance of a lot of attractions, including the cable car stations. Lots of shopping in nearby Union Square. I flew in from Oakland and found the BART perfect -- drops you a block from the hotel at the Powell Street station. The nightly wine tastings in the library were a real treat. Well attended while I was there and a great way to meet others. Missed the Wednesday night book reading. I signed up for the morning continental breakfast and think I got my money's worth. $6 doesn't buy you much elsewhere in SF. Downsides if you're there for business: Wireless service was lousy. My cell didn't work well in my room, which faced the courtyard. Too much concrete between me and the cell tower. Also, they offer high speed thru wireless but I needed a special device that they were out of the week I was there so I couldn't do my work at night, had to find another location. The price was right; the staff superb. Highly recommend it, especially for pleasure travelers."
140,2071,"Feb 26 2005	Very Noisy	My husband and I stayed here for a week: Dec 12-18, 2004. We are not very picky people - we are grad students, and have slept in very humble accomodations in many countries, and enjoy camping. However, when one pays $129/night, one expects a decent hotel stay.Pros: Location (right by Union Square); Free Internet Access; some Aveda bathroom products.Neutral: 5-6pm Happy Hour. The wine was not very good, and the lobby was so crowded. (We were there during a science conference, so it was a lot of young people trying to maximize their wine consumption during the 60 minute happy hour - kind of overwhelming if you do not like crowds). The corn bread was nice, though.Major Con: the noise. We could not sleep. There was construction going on outside our room ALL NIGHT, every night! In one way you could say this was not the hotel's fault; however, their odd window situation makes it their fault. Our room had 2 windows, and in each there was an AC unit (that doubled as a heater) that could not be removed. It was semi-built-in. Therefore, the windows were permanently open. My husband had to present at the science conference, and could not get a good night's sleep. We bought earplugs, we complained (requested a room on the inside corridor, but none available), we turned on the AC fans just to drown out the noise. Nothing worked. I would caution a business traveler NOT to stay here if you need to be alert the next day. The street noise is severe even absent the construction, and the walls are paper thin. You can hear people in the hallway and the next room.I politely complained while I was there, and they did not solve the problem. They sent me an email survey after our stay, and I told them what I'm writing here. They sent an apology email, but no discount offer for another Kimpton Hotel."
141,2071,"Feb 3 2005	Great location Great Price 	Stayed here for two nights as our first taste of the States. Very easy to get to from the airport being less than a 100 metres from a BART station. Check-in was easy and the staff friendly. We had two rooms that were close to each other, one for the adults and one for the kids. The rooms had a good arrangement with a lounge room and bedroom w/ensuite neatly separated by the entry, turn one way for the lounge, turn the other for the bed. With TV's in each this meant both kids could watch their shows without disturbing the other. The rooms were also nicely furnished and although the bathrooms were old style and smallish, they were part of the history of the place...take it as charm. The hotel is well located on Ellis just off Powell and the cable car route and it is quiet. Our other hotel choice was the Villa Florence which is well rated but some reviews complain of noise and it is easy to see why as it is right on Powell. If you want to be confronted by the evening throng of street scammers as you leave the hotel then stay there. The Monticello is much quieter and allows you to get your bearings in peace and then blend in."
142,2071,"Jan 19 2005	Charming Small Hotel; Unbeatable Location Near Cable Cars	I stayed at the Monticello Inn for six nights, Jan. 4-10, 2005, with my daughter and her friend. I attended a major conference in San Francisco in early January and did not want to stay at any of the three large conference hotels nearby. After reading the reviews on this site, I booked a Jefferson Suite directly with the hotel rather than using one of the online travel reservation sites. Later I emailed the hotel and changed my original check-in date from January 3 to January 4, and received a prompt and courteous email response confirming that our reservation had been changed to check in on Jan. 4. When we arrived at the hotel at about 1:30 pm on Jan. 4, the desk clerk told me the reservation had been cancelled completely. I tersely told the clerk that I had booked directly with the hotel to be sure I would not have any problems with making the reservation through one of the online services. He responded that &quot;none of the guarantees apply&quot; if a reservation is made through an online service. Once again I firmly reminded him that was exactly why I had made my reservation directly with the hotel. After this exchange, he managed to &quot;work us in&quot; to a Jefferson Suite on the fifth floor -- the top floor of the hotel. I then specifically requested a room on the courtyard side where it would be more quiet. He confirmed it was a courtyard suite and cautioned us it was the best he had available. After this snafu, the rest of our stay was very nice. The room was a good size two-room suite. Many of the furnishings appeared to be new, although some of the living area upholstery was a little worn. The bathroom was small but adequate, with bath soap, shampoo, and conditioner in dispensers near the sink and in the shower. The fixtures (sink and tub) were worn, and the tile around the shower needed some minor repairs. Basic toiletries (bar soap, shower cap, sewing kit) were never replaced the entire six-day stay. White and red wine was served in the charming lobby every evening from 5:00 to 6:00. The lobby was graced with comfortable seating and two fireplaces. The service throughout our stay was friendly and accommodating. Although the hotel has no ice machines accessible to guests, every time we asked for ice or something else (coffee pot, another robe, more towels) our request was addressed promptly and courteously (without tipping). The king-size bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the wireless high-speed internet access worked flawlessly -- a welcome change from some hotels. Best of all, the Inn's location is unbeatable. Powell Street is a short half-block away, and Union Street shopping is just a couple of blocks north of the hotel. I walked a short block each day to and from the huge conference hotel and was so glad I was staying in a smaller, friendlier, much more charming hotel. If you have time for sightseeing, buy a 3-day or 7-day pass ($ 20) at the visitor's center a just a block south of the hotel, and ride the cable cars, buses, and muni-trains as much as you wish. We found a Mediterranean restaurant one block north of the hotel with very good food for the price, an inexpensive Thai restaurant one block away on Powell, and great sushi at a second-floor restaurant on the corner right across the street from the hotel. Great food at very reasonable prices for San Francisco! Overall, we had a delightful stay, and we were impressed with the friendly and very helpful staff. The next time I visit downtown San Francisco, I will look forward to staying at the Monticello Inn again."
143,2071,"Jan 10 2005	great place	we stayed at the monticello sep 03. its got a lovely reception area, with free tea/coffee available pretty much all day, with a free wine reception one night a week too. our room was a good size, with a massive bed and the bathroom was pretty massive too, with a full size window which opened out onto a view of downtown (bit weird to sit in the bathroom looking out the window, i know, but it was actually quite fun sitting on the windowsill watching people go by). the hotel has a good location, only 5mins from the cable car terminus and union sq. so yes, it can be a little noisy at night as the cable car goes by, but hey you're in the city, what do you expect? all in all, good hotel right in the centre for a reasonable price!"
144,2071,"Jan 5 2005	Good value great location	Stayed at the Monticello over Memorial Day weekend 2004. Was genuinely surprised and pleased that the room we reserved turned out to be a suite. I wasn't expecting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful, from replacing our mini-bar when the key broke off in it (!), to addressing a plumbing issue with a tempermental toliet, to securing our bags after checking out while we toured the city on our last day in town, to arranging for our shuttle ride to the airport. Also very convienent to the cable car terminus and other public transportation. All-in-all, a good experience."
145,2071,"Dec 24 2004	This is a two-star hotel and not worth full price.	I travel frequently for business and in general have had good experience with the Kimpton chain. This hotel, however, was disappointing. I spoke at some length with the front desk before booking online, and was told it was a 3-star, newly renovated, and breakfast was included. I don't know who I spoke to, but none of this turned out to be true. This hotel plays the 'put you in a crappy room and see if you complain game', a ploy also mentioned by other reviewers. They do follow through with the fix or upgrade but I dislike these games. Most of the hotel is not newly renovated, and features stains on the substandard carpets, linens, and towels. Beds are lumpy and should be replaced. Staff is friendly but often never quite manages to solve the problem, in that very two star way. I slept the first two nights in rooms with no heat, finally after the third room move they gave me a space heater. I appreciated the solution but not the time involved in moving several times on a business trip. The lobby is nice, and wine tasting is a decent touch, but they need to forget about the frills and get back to basics, like a decent bed, a renovated bathroom, and a floor that doesn't make a person cringe. If you book in advance, online, you can get a room for $99/night. I wouldn't pay more than that. Considering it as a two-star in that price range, I would say it's average. What I disliked was the misrepresentation at the time of booking. Overall, this is an ok two-star hotel, but not worth full price."
146,2071,"Oct 31 2004	Very good hotel	I spent 8 nights at the Monticello Inn the third week of October. I arrived early, about 1pm on a Saturday, and my room was ready which was a pleasant surprise. I had a courtyard room, the view is not that great, but it is VERY quiet. I expect Street view rooms are noisy since this is a busy area of San Francisco. The bed was excellent. Just as good as the Hyatt's and Marriott's I have recently stayed at. Bathroom was spotless and comfortable, loved the dispensers for soap and shampoo. Staff was always friendly and attentive. Location is excellent, within 1 block of BART, cable cars and almost all Muni busses. Subway sandwich shop is next door along with a Burger King 1/2 block away. The only disappointment was that breakfast was not included in the rate. I booked on the Internet and had a $116 rate for one person, which is more than I normally pay, but it seems about average for San Francisco. I would stay here again, the location and the beds make it a winner."
147,2071,"Oct 28 2004	Loved the Monticello Inn	Our first night was not satisfactory. Arrived at 11pm and our room was small with two double beds that overlooked Ellis street on the 3rd floor. Construction site across the road commenced works at 6am and collection of rubbish and street noise was unbearable. Requested a room change the following morning and were placed in a large room with two king size beds that was in the core of the building. Heaven!!! A big thank you to Carlos at the front desk. Great location, close to shopping, restaurants and transport. Would have liked to stay additional two nights but the hotel was booked out. All staff were very helpful. Had difficulties with TV and wireless internet connection. Problems were rectified immediately and very effectively. Free access to wireless network was fantastic. Decor was outdated but overall rooms were clean and provided all the necessities. We will definitely stay at the Monticello Inn again when we return to San Francisco in the future."
148,2071,Oct 15 2004	Excellent hotel right in the heart of everything!!	We recently had the privilege of staying at the Monticello Inn for 7 days. We had a corner suite and it was simply amazing! The staff is very accomodating and the room was spacious and very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the San Francisco area. The hotel is in a GREAT location close to public transportation and most everything is within walking distance. If you are visiting the area I would recommend this hotel.
149,2071,"Aug 16 2004	Nice hotel great location	Three of us had a one bedroom suite here for a week in early August. Our bedroom was quite big - plenty of room for the tons of shopping we accumulated in San Francisco. The living room was a decent size also - looking into the internal courtyard. We found no problems with cleanliness although the room did smell a bit musty when we arrived.Two minor complaints though. Firstly, the walls were pretty thin. You could hear people walking around upstairs and in the hall. This wasnt a huge problem. It didnt keep me awake at night and I'm a pretty light sleeper. Secondly, the room decor certainly needs to be updated - the blue and white wallpaper in the living room was a bit loud and garish. The hotel lobby is decorated much better. The evening wine reception was a nice feature and we took advantage of this a couple of times after a long day's shopping. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.The location is really superb - Union Square is a couple of minutes walk. The Powell cable car and BART/MUNI are just around the corner.We didnt eat at the hotel restaurant next door although it looked good. We had continental breakfast one morning in the lobby which was great value - $5 per room not per person !!Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. We found the hotel to be comfortable and in a great location. Would stay a second time if we got the right price again."

3,2073,"Nov 10 2009 	OK for a brief stay but shower hopeless	We stayed here briefly on arrival late in San Francisco, before transferring to the Beresford Arms. It was OK, reception staff not especially friendly on arrival and our room was smallish with a tiny bathroom. Surprisingly quiet for its location which was very convenient near Union Square. Shower difficult to operate and was quite cold. Breakfast was good though."
4,2073,"Oct 27 2009 	Vell located	Hotel located near the Powell street Bart station (usefull for the trip from/to the airport.)Breakfast was good, the room was clean and unnoisy.There is an computer and wifi access in the &quot;internet room&quot;.About 40 minutes walk to go to the Pier 39 (Fisherman's warf area, boats to Alcatraz)."
5,2073,"Oct 20 2009 	Great Location!	We attended a private party at Ruby Skye on 7/28/09 and decided to stay at Beresford instead of driving home after the party. ... The room was small but clean. We got Room 516, which was at the back of the hotel and quiet. We had a pleasant stay. The restaurant was still closed when we stayed there. We left our small luggage at the hotel after we checked out the next day while we did touristy thing in SF the next day (riding the cable car, visiting the sea lions at Pier 39, etc.) We picked up our luggage at 5 pm and took BART home to Fremont. Overal a nice and convenient hotel and we'll definitely stay there again."
6,2073,"Oct 19 2009 	Eaten alive	I have just returned to Australia after a trip to the States that had been great until it was ruined by my last week which I spent at the Hotel Beresford in San Fran. I spent nearly $US1000 to stay there for 5 days and the following happened:(1) I was eaten alive by bed bugs. The bites are so severe my Doctor has had to prescribe two courses of antibiotics, I have had to take time of work and I feel terrible. My entire body is covered with large, inflammed, red lumps and bites. Not only, but also: (2) They made me pay them money before they would call me a taxi from reception. (3) They refused to provide me with an extra blanket which I needed because my room was so cold. My recommendation is to avoid this hotel like the plague."
7,2073,"Oct 18 2009 	Our Accommodation	This place is terrible. No aircon, no fans, no window you can leave open as not secure enough. San francisco has all those fire escapes in buildings &amp; if you leave anything open who knows who will crawl in!! Location was fine, but everything else YUCK YUCK YUCK"
8,2073,"Oct 13 2009 	Affordable Hotel in Great Location	This was our second trip to SF and our second time staying at Hotel Beresford. We chose this hotel at the recommendation of a family member who has stayed at this hotel many times. We had all positive experiences here and love the location of the hotel just being two blocks from Union Square and transportation. No it is not a 5 star hotel, but you can't beat the price for San Francisco and you do get a very clean room with cable TV. We don't spend much time in our room anyway while here, there is too much to see!"
9,2073,"Oct 10 2009 	not impressed	We tried this hotel based in part on the positive reviews here but were a bit disappointed. Of course the location is great, but our room was small, crowded, and awkward--there was very little desk/counter space to put things on. There's no in-room hair dryer, although you can ask for one at the front desk. There were just two pillows on the bed, and the front desk will not give you more than two extra. The public computer seems to be always occupied, but we finally realized that although there was no wi-fi in our room, it was available in the computer room. One woman at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating, but the next shift seemed less so, and I had to wait in line for quite a while to ask for more pillows. Generally a bit shabbier than we expected."
10,2073,"Sep 29 2009 	Union Square area for under $80	Have stayed here on 5 occassions now, its a good deal when you can't get a 4 star hotel under $100. This property fits the bill, its in a decent area, close to everything and offers a pretty decent continental breakfast(muffins,donuts,bagels, juices,milk, fruits) I look forward to visit #6"
11,2073,Sep 29 2009	Central location	The best thing about this hotel was the location. The rooms were small but comfortable. No hairdryer in the room but you could get one from the main desk. We were part of a tour and some of the others complained that the staff were disinterested. The breakfast was adequate but they did provide china cups as well as paper ones. Free use of the internet.
12,2073,"Aug 13 2009 	Not bad	Only 2 blocks away to the cable car stop, nearby got the 24-hour grocery store. The location is greatThe room is extremely small, no A/C, but got the fan. But there got the smell, not a good smell. BTW, the room is clean, then is fine.There got the FREE breakfast, and FREE wireless, but the wireless is slow. There got the computer for the guests to use.In conclusion, it;s still OK that compare to the room rates."
13,2073,"Aug 5 2009	Great value and location!	We loved our stay here- great value for what we paid. Central location and valet parking were also a plus. Breakfast was basic but very good, better than the usual as far as continental breakfast goes. The front desk staff was always helpful and very personable; they helped us book a great tour (Muir Woods &amp; Sausalito by ferry) at a cheaper price than we'd have otherwise gotten. The bus picks you up at the front door, which is great, because driving in this city is a total pain.I'd definitely recommend this place to others. Do be aware, though, that if you stay here, the cellphone reception isn't great in the rooms. But since we spent very little time in our room, it wasn't an issue. No internet in the rooms, but it's easy to stop by the internet room with a laptop to use the wifi or the hotel's computer."
14,2073,"Jul 19 2009 	A nice stay for the money we paid	It's a good hotel. Nice area, close to everything. Staff was friendly. I would go there again."
15,2073,"Jun 28 2009	Could have been better	Although on the main street we were placed at the back and our room was quite although there was NO air conditioning!! Cramped public areas. Restaurant still out of action. Breakfast fine if you got there early for seating. Strange and not so friendly staff. You had to ask for a hair dryer which isnt much fun when you expect one in the room and have showered then have to walk to Reception and pick one up! Beware of lift doors as they have a mind of their own. No tea/coffee facilities, limited TV channels. Good location for shops, cable cars, restaurants and China Town. Loris Diner excellent value and 50's atmosphere only one block away with excellent staff. Would only recommend this hotel purely for location."
16,2073,"Jun 26 2009	Poor value	This hotel is situated on a noisy street and is very cramped for space in the rooms and public areas. The restaurant was being decorated when we were there which was very inconvenient and meant breakfast was a joke in the cramped bar. The reception staff were very off hand and did not really seem very interested. The views from the rooms was grim, heating ducts and brick walls. I would not stay here again."
17,2073,"Jun 24 2009 	Beware of Porters with attitude	I stayed here on Sunday night with my wife prior to flying home on the Monday from SF. We parked the hire car outside the hotel and the porter took our bags up to our room on his trolley.He then wasn't very happy at the one dollar tip I gave him and told me he could valet park my car til the next morning for a one off fee of 24 dollars. When I declined his offer he wasn't too impressed, but neither was I when I discovered that Sunday is free parking on the meters in Sutter St where the hotel is situated!Ideal spot for central SF location, pity about the door porter."
18,2073,"May 29 2009 	A good place to stay in San Francisco	MollettsBrisbane, AustraliaMay 29, 2009My husband and I, together with our 30 year old daughter have just spent 7 nights at this hotel. On a previous visit to SF my husband and I stayed at a hotel further down Sutter Street but did discover the bar and restaurant at the Beresford. The restaurant was good value and good homestyle food so imagine my disappointment when we arrived to be told that the restaurant has been closed for the past couple of months for renovation and is not due to open again until later in June. The bar was still open however and our daughter enjoyed her evenings there with the friendly bartender (female) and she was able to meet people around her own age. There is also a happy hour (?) from 5.30 - 8.30pm with free hot appetisers, consisting mainly of hot dogs and I think meatballs but we didn't avail ourselves of these. I have to say that the on-site restaurant was the main reason we decided to stay at this hotel but that was our only disappointment. The staff was friendly and helpful (although there seemed to be someone different every time we went to the lobby) and the rates were very reasonable. We had a room with two double beds on the 7th floor in the front of the hotel. I would not advise staying in this part of the hotel as it is very noisy. There is no air conditioning so the windows were left open. Ask for a room at the back. The room itself was comfortable which is all we ask for in a hotel - cleanliness and a comfortable bed and of course a safe area. The location of the hotel is excellent - 1 block to Powell Street and the cable cars and another block to Union Square. There are many great places to eat in SF - we found the Italian on the corner (Cesarios) to be very good and Lori's Diner is a block away. A continental breakfast is included in the rate and it is OK but I find Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast a bit much. There was cereal, croissants and fresh fruit so we didn't need to have the sugary donuts and danishes. If you are looking for 5 star luxury this hotel is certainly not it but as other reviewers have said it has an old-world feel. There is also free internet access but for some reason neither our daughter nor I could access our emails. The management at the time didn't seem very interested in fixing the problem and for the first few days we seemed to get limited television access but these are minor problems. I would certainly recommend the Beresford for location and value."
19,2073,"May 20 2009 	Good Location Poor Plumbing and Fire Safety	We stayed here in March 2009 as part of an organised tour - the accomodation had been booked by a tour company.The location of the hotel is very good and all central shopping areas, restaurants and transport are within easy walking distance. Our first problem on arrival was that the key they gave us for the room would not open the door so someone came with another key and this would not open the door either, a third key and we were in. My first thought was to check the fire escape arrangements and there was an external fire escape at the front of the hotel which could be accessed from each corridor and this was fine but the fire escape from the rear part of the upper floors was through two bedrooms on each floor. As the doors were locked I went I went down to the Front Desk and asked how we would get to the Rear Fire Exit in an emergency through the locked doors - he did not know so I asked for the Manager and was told she was not available so I left a message for her to contact me. We then went out for the evening and when we returned we found that the taps would not work so I phoned the front desk and was informed that we had to turn on the valves under the sink - as these could not be turned they sent a member of staff who also could not turn these valves on. We then had to move rooms with no help from hotel staff and when we ran water into the sink the plug would not let the water out and part of the plumbing from behind the sink fell onto the floor. When I went down to the Front Desk I was given a handful of keys and was told to go and choose a room where everything worked. As the Manager had not come back to me about the fire exit problem I selected on of the rooms which lead directly to the rear fire escape.I also approached the travel company representative who was also staying in the hotel and she indicated that it was nothing to do with her and could I let her have my comments in writing which I did. By the time we left no one was able to answer how we would be able to use the fire escape so on my return I wrote to the travel company again and to the San Francisco Fire Department who have also not replied. I also copied my letter to the Mayor of San Francisco who also has not replied so if you stay here just ask yourself how you will get out in a fire?"
20,2073,"Mar 9 2009	Gem of a find	My elderly mother and I stayed here for 7 nights. The room was quite adequate, clean and comfortable. The staff was very accomodating and when we had to call the front desk one morning at 3:30 am to complain about some noisy neighbors, it was taken care of immediately. The locations couldn't be better for shopping and be sure to try Lori's Diner down the street for any meal."
21,2073,"Dec 27 2008 	Affordable and great location	Old style motel with victorian style rooms and corridoors. Very comfortable, cosy and romantic. Not 5 star at all, but all of the comforts of home, with stocked bar fridge, TV with cable channels, small bathroom and restaurant on site. Very close to Union square and easy access to taxis and trams to get to tourist areas. Close to theatre district. Laundromats available within walking distance. Local attractionsIt is definitely worth a trip to the Golden gate bridge, Alcatraz, Fishermans wharf and Alamo Square. Also, I highly recommend a self paced tour via the Go Cars which are available for hire at Union Square or Fishermans Wharf (gocartours.com)"
22,2073,"Oct 9 2008 	Great Deal for simple and charming experience	Got this hotel through cheap tickets.comI was worried because of some more negative reviews, but I was actually impressed when I got there. It seems all of San Fransisco has tons of charming older buildings that I'm not used to. Before this I was used to staying in chain motels or hotels. So, I just enjoyed being able to stay in a building that was not built yesterday. The furnishings are old and ugly, but somehow charming (like an ugly dog that seems cute). Also, the breakfasts in the little pub downstairs offered a nicer fare than your regular continental breakfasts.Traveling in March, I did not notice any problems with the lack of A/C in the building. We did sleep with the windows open all night which made for a comfortable breeze. Although, the college dorms across the street the and pub guests down below were somewhat noisy, I was able to sleep just fine. My dad was more bothered by it than I was. I think the noise of the town became more like white noise for me. It's never quiet...but it's the city afterall. It was close to the cable cars which gave you quick access to all the attractions. There is no need to worry about transportation in this city! Only on one day did we rent a car to check out places further from town (Muir Woods, coastline, and Golden Gate Park). I wouldn't want to have to park a car on the streets more than I had to...those hills are scary steep:DMy whole reason for this trip was to see a She and Him concert. This portion of my trip was a bit trickier because the venue was not in the nicest part of town. A quick cab ride solved any of my reservations about walking the few blocks. If you are looking for a luxury experience I would not recommend this hotel. If you are looking to enjoy the charm of this city and not pay out the rear, then this is a great place to stay!"
23,2073,"Sep 29 2008	Victorian and Ancient	Having recently spent 4 nights at this hotel we were very dissapointed at the noise we had to tolerate from our room being adjacent to what we believe was Student accomodation. The room was small, needed a thorough update, it showed its Victorian Style leaving us to believe we were in the Victorian era.The Shower was grotty, the taps grimy and after showering you still didn't feel clean. The window of the shower was also broken.We have never known a hotel to close its very popular restaurant for 2 nights, and the bar for 1 night.Sorry Beresford but I wont be staying with you again, and wouldn't recommend it."
24,2073,"Sep 22 2008	Very Small room for a double	Stayed at the Beresford for 3 nights during a coach tour. We expected a small room but it was smaller than acceptable with only one bedside cabinet for what was supposed to be a double room. The phone was connected at the opposite side of the room and there was no clock/alarm. The room was very cold when we arrived and when we asked about heating we were told it can only be put on to heat the whole hotel. We got heating the following evening only.l No tea/coffee making facilities in the room either. The receptionist was rather abrupt and unfriendly. Good points were the hotel was clean, served a nice breakfast. had free internet connection for 15 mins at a time and handy for Union Square."
25,2073,"Aug 12 2008 	Great location nice staff hot rooms	My husband and I live just across the bay and often go to shows in San Francisco and stay in Union Square for the weekend. This was our first stay at the Hotel Bereford. The hotel had a great location and was very clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were clean and small, but who needs alot of room when y ou don't plan on being it it much! Only problem I had was there was no air conditioner or screens on the large window. We were on the 7th floor and had to leave the window wide open all day and night to get some air flow becaue it was so stuffy. If we had a child this would have been a big problem because the window started about 3 feet up from the wall and anything could have fallen out it since there was no screen. Unfortunately it was a loud night in the city and we did not get much sleep with the windows open. A ceiling fan would have been nice. We came back from a show around midnight and went into the White Horse Tavern attached to the hotel. It was a very nice English style pub but was unbearably hot and stuffy also so we decided to have drinks in our room.I would go back to this hotel but only in the winter."
26,2073,"Jul 22 2008 	Good Value...	My sister and I stayed here for a weekend last November. The first thing I thought when I walked into the hotel was that it had charm and character. It is unlike the usual hotel chains in the US, more like a place you'd expect to find in Europe. My sister and I were first assigned to a room on the first floor, which looked like it had not been cleaned yet and smelled a little funny. The bathroom appeared dirty and there were hairs on the pillows in the beds, which obviously did not belong to us as we had just checked in. We went to the front desk and told them about our room. They were apologetic and switched us to a room on the 2nd floor, which was much more nice, cozy, and more importantly, clean, compared to the last one. The hotel is in a great location, just a short walking distance to Union Square and some great shopping. I don't know that I would stay here again, the only problem I encountered was the cleanliness of the first room. Other than that, the stay was perfectly fine, the hotel staff friendly, and the continental breakfast good. Over all, it was a good value for the price, just make sure you get a clean room."
27,2073,"Jun 19 2008 	Fabulous old San Francisco Hotel	This old &quot;boutique&quot; Hotel was more than we ever expected for the price. The room was clean and well appointed, the Hotel Staff was more than accomodating including keeping our luggage after we checked out so we could enjoy the City for another full day and keeping our car also. They were very polite and helpful with any questions we had. The FREE Breakfast was wonderful in the White Horse as was the Fabulous dinner we had there the night before! We felt like we were back in Paris!! This is a TOP NOTCH Hotel in a wonderful city close to everything and within walking distance to Union square."
28,2073,"Apr 27 2008 	Great value charming character	Hotel Beresford is not going to win any luxury awards. The rooms are indeed small, at least the cheap ones. However, I loved my stay there! It was refreshingly different from the plain vanilla hotels you can find anywhere in the US.What you can expect: - Charm and character: The carpets are deep red. The light fixtures are crystal. The elevator has etched mirrors inside. Each room is decorated differently, and yeah, it felt a little like staying at my grandma's house, what with the two double beds in a room big enough for one queen, but I enjoyed it. - Good value: Our room was just over $100/night, including taxes. You can hardly beat that in San Francisco, and being right next to Union Square we could walk to most of what we wanted to see and easily take buses or cable car to the rest.- Safety: We were two single women wandering around San Francisco, but arriving back to the hotel made us feel right at home and safe. It's in a decent neighborhood; we walked a few blocks in all four directions at various times. The restaurants around the hotel are either expensive or small and cheap. There's a swanky Mexican place two blocks away, or for chain food, a diner two blocks in the other direction. There's a corner Walgreen's nearby too, for essentials you forget; not as cheap as in the 'burbs, but cheaper than the airport or a convenience store. - Good food: The restaurant in the hotel had delicious food at a reasonable price; we two split a leg of lamb, an appetizer, and drinks for $40. Make sure you check the hours (only open for dinner, and not on Sundays) -- but it was great the one night we came home without the energy to look around. The continental breakfast was fruit, cereal, and pastries, with milk, juice, tea and coffee -- nothing impressive but enough to fill us up and get us going in the morning.What not to expect: - Internet: There's an old, slow computer in the lobby which might last long enough to check your e-mail on, but you'll have to wait in line for it.- Things to be new: The whole building is old. The rooms are old, so the windows and bathroom fixtures and furniture are also old. I felt it was clean enough (I wasn't afraid to stand on the carpet or in the shower), but it didn't look new. - Spaciousness: We were only in the room to sleep, and there was plenty of room for that. Four people in our room would have been tight, but it was billed as two twin beds (they were actually doubles; twins would've made the room feel bigger) so I hope you don't TRY to put four people into it. Overall, I recommend it for people who are planning to be out and about all day and want a nice place to come back to."
29,2073,"Apr 14 2008	Disappointed!	We have just completed a two week tour of California and had stayed in nine different hotels / inns / motels. I can honestly say that the Beresford was the worst we had stayed in.Firstly, our room was freezing cold (as was the same with other guests on the same tour - especially the Queen Anne rooms) due to the bathroom window not shutting properly so had a hurricane blowing through making the whole room cold. The windows were glass shutters with a quarter of an inch gap in between each one of the panes. According to the reception staff all the Queen rooms were the same!!! After having spent a night in the room we asked to move as we couldnt cope with the cold.One particular reception staff was quite rude and abrupt whenever we complained about the room. Once we moved to a twin room, a huge difference, the room was lovely and warm.Appart from the problems, the hotel was centrally located and there was a free breakfast every morning.I for one though, would not be returning to the Beresford."
30,2073,"Mar 29 2008 	Excellent Value for Money	We stayed for 3 nights in early March 2008. On arrival we were given a free upgrade to a suite which included kitchen (with honesty drinks in the fridge), dining area, living room area, 2 double beds and jacuzzi bathroom. It was fantastic. The hotel is victorian but had character. It was very clean and all staff were helpful. We had not expected breakfast so the coffee, pastries and fruit were a great bonus if you wanted to get out quickly. The wine and cheese were also enjoyable if you got back in time. There were 2 computers to use with free internet access (though no printing). The location was excellent, very near Union Square. For the price we paid it was extremely good value for money."
31,2073,"Mar 22 2008 	Great location shame about the hotel...	I have just returned from a week's holiday staying at this hotel. The location is fantastic, only a few minutes walk from Union Square and the majority of the staff are friendly and helpful. However, the rooms seem to be in need of repair- we stayed in two during our stay and the first had a broken television and window that wouldn't open whist the second had broken furniture, electric sockets that sparked when in use and a blind that fell completely off the wall in the middle of the night. While the rooms seemed clean there was a terrible smell of rubbish on our floor of the hotel (clearly from bins that had been left in the corridor after being removed from the bathrooms). The Beresford is also unfortunate enough to employ a couple of staff members who are rude, surly and completely unhelpful and are a discredit to those employees who were polite and accommodating to guests. Luckily we did not stay in the hotel much as we were out exploring for the majority of our stay, only returning late at night. But if you plan to spend a bit more time in your hotel then personally I would look elsewhere for accommodation. We will not be making a repeat visit."
32,2073,"Jan 27 2008 	Great value and location for the money	we stayed at the hotel beresford for two weeks and overall enjoyed our stay there. the location is great and the hotel is worth the money. the building is quite old as is the interior. but it is relatively cheap, you get a clean room, which is not noisy and in a great spot.breakfast comes on styropor plates and cups, comprises of cereal, danish pastries and fruit, and is presented in a very simple way.we had no tv and there was no wifi available, but there was a computer with internet connection available for free next to the reception. however, this single computer was occupied most of the time so that we decided to take our laptops into the sugar cafe a few doors up the road which is a great designer cafe for coffe, cake and free internet."
33,2073,"Jan 22 2008 	good value for the price	We stayed at the Hotel Beresford for 4 nights at the beginning of October. We booked far in advance which is a good thing since it was Fleet week.The hotel is very conveniently located if you are a tourist (as we were). The cable car is a 3 minute walk away and there are also buses running right past the hotel. Union Square is a short walk away and Chinatown is also within walking distance. There are lots of places to eat nearby. The hotel itself is good value for money. We were actually amazed to find such a reasonable place so close to the centre of town.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was medium sized and the bed was comfortable. We overlooked the back, so it was fairly quiet. But don't expect a view! The bathroom was OK, the minibar well stocked and not expensive and there was plenty of wardrobe space.Breakfast was served in the restaurant on the ground floor. This was quite ample by American hotel standards. Cereals, fruit, pastries, coffee - as much as you could eat from a buffet.There was a pleasant friendly atmosphere in the breakfast room with tourists from many countries, mostly of the 40-60 age group. Only thing we didn't like was the plastic cutlery and plates! This is something Europeans really have a problem getting used to.All in all, we found the hotel good value for money and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small friendly convenient place and doesn't expect luxury."
34,2073,"Nov 6 2007 	Decent Hotel for the money	I booked this hotel for 5 nights and for the most part enjoyed it. Great location to Union Square and many dining options within walking distance. Walking to the Powell-Hyde Trolley line was three blocks away. They also have a wine&amp; cheese hour every day which was a nice treat for an evening rest for a day full of site seeing. Things I disliked most about the hotel were, the room had thin walls, ice machine only avail. in the lobby, and one staff member was not too friendly. I say this only because this person gave us a hard time checking in. Overall I would stay here again if I got a good deal, otherwise I would invest a little more on a hotel closer to Union Square or maybe a 4star hotel with heaters. No AC units in the rooms, a heater would have made the cold nights more comfortable."
35,2073,"Oct 30 2007 	What a convenient location!	We traveled as a group of four women (booked 2 rooms) to spend a long weekend in San Fran and run the Nike Women's Marathon. We had two rooms with double beds. The rooms are small and the bathroom is small (with great water pressure). The hotel is without air conditioning so you must open the window and use a fan (supplied in the closet) to circulate air. The rooms and bathrooms are clean.They have a lounge with a computer and provide a little mini-breakfast each morning.We enjoyed our stay and the accommodations were great for a ladies weekend. Considering the nightly rate, I think this hotel is a great find.One comment: They use alot of room freshner in this hotel. We ask for them to skip our room when we stayed."
36,2073,"Oct 26 2007 	It takes some getting use to	The building is old, the rooms are small, and functional. But the rooms are clean, quiter than I expected, and the staff very helpful. Good locationwith many good places to eat nearby.Great deal for the price."
37,2073,"Oct 18 2007 	Not recommended; add a few bucks and stay elsewhere	First of all, it is important to emphasize that different sites rate this hotel differently, the rating varying between two-star, three-star and even &quot;boutique&quot;, which, for all I know, usually stands for &quot;a two-star property at a four-star rate&quot;. IMHO, the two-star rating would be right on the money, and I felt that Orbitz misled me by selling be this hotel as a three-star property.The hotel is located very close to Union Square, but the neighborhood is not very pleasant. There is a lot of homeless folks soliciting donations and sleeping on the sidewalk right next to the hotel, and quite a few cheap food and wine joints attracting way too much attention until very late hours. The hotel is old. It looks old and worse than that smells old. The lobby is tiny with just three chairs and a small coffee table. The staff tries their best, but they do not speak too much English and are sometimes hard to understand. We have been given a tiny room in the middle of a corridor, with a window facing a loud AC exhaust of the neighboring building just several feet away. After lengthy discussions, we were able to get another room facing Post St., in the third floor. The room was tiny, too, and the bathroom was literally three by six feet. Certain acrobatics skills were required to use the toilet. The shower unit was worn, but the water pressure excellent. There was a tiny broken TV and a little portable fan in the room. The bed was very short and way too soft. Although it was not even summer, we needed to open the window during the night hours to get some fresh air, bu this solution was far from ideal due to excessive street noise. We could not get any night rest at all. Our reservation came with complimentary breakfast (nothing special, standard cheap hotel fare).I wish I knew. For ten dollars a night more I could have booked a much better property. Do not repeat my mistakes."
38,2073,"Oct 14 2007 	Convenient location	If you're planning on spending most of your day exploring the city and just need a place to sleep at night then this hotel is for you. It's two blocks from the Powell-Hyde cable car line and a Walgreens where you can buy a day pass. However it's also a walkable distance to a major shopping district, Chinatown, and plenty of restaurants. The rooms are tiny and lack air conditioning. Be sure to ask for a room away from Sutter street so that you can avoid the noise of traffic. It won't have a view but at least it'll be quiet. The front desk staff was very helpful. The hotel has a business center downstairs, but it's not well advertised. We didn't find it until the day before we checked out. All in all a decent hotel for the price."
39,2073,"Oct 14 2007 	my scottish adventure	I stayed at the Beresford for 7 nights and had a fantastic time in San Francisco.Went to Monster Park to see the 49ers play the ravens,went to Alcatraz which is a must and if you want to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge it will take you around 40 minutes one way.There is an Irish bar called Lefty o' Doul's on Geary street 2 blocks down which is brilliant,met loads of irish,my own country men and many folks from Baltimore as they were playing the 49ers.Lefty's has live music every night which is fun although i went outside for a cigarette and got hassled by the homeless,don't give them any money as they will keep coming back.The Tenderloin disrict which is the bad part of San Francisco is not far away.Outside the Hotel turn right,walk 2 blocks along and walk down Powell and that will take you to the heart of Union Square.If you go left you are walking towards the Tenderloin.The Hotel staff are friendly and can't do enough for you,if you come back late at night the Hotel is locked,you just have to ring the bell and someone will let you in.There is a bar next door called The White Horse which opens at 5:30 where you can have a beer and have you're dinner at a very reasonable price.You also have a free continental breakfast there from 7 till 10-30.The rooms are small but clean,depending which room you are staying it can be noisy at night.A public transport ticket is $18 for 3 days but it is a great city for walking in.I walked to Fishermans Wharf through Chinatown and it took me 25mins,depending which way you go it can be VERY hilly.Overall i loved my stay in san Francisco which was my first time in the United States.I made many friends and felt very safe as i was on my own and would recommend this hotel and would use it again if i come back"
40,2073,"Aug 16 2007 	Would stay here again Great hotel 	Great hotel for the price!!Yes the room furniture maybe eclectic , but who cares! The price and honor bar make you feel so good after along flight, or a brisk walk all the way from Fisherman's wharf, an afternoon of sailing &amp; wine tasting or a long day of sightseeing... in otherwards, why would one stay in the room. Loved a light and healthy breakfast every morning. Very Clean and hot water, even smoking rooms. The location is perfect for using public transportation. Want to have some late night fun? Walk a couple blocks to the Starlight room. An incredible view of San Fran. Like retro, eat at Laurie's Diner. Theatre district, Nob Hill, Union sqaure, Chinatown all within walking district. Cannot wait to go back and will proably stay here because it felt so welcoming!!! Loved it"
41,2073,"Aug 14 2007 	Quaint and Great	First time to SF. Where else would you find a clean, comfortable city centre hotel with character for $107 a night, including breakfast? Stayed 4 nights, room 504. Room good size, from a British perspective, comfortable queen size bed, a shower which blasts water not an apologetic trickle, well stocked minibar at reasonble prices, no view but who cares. Better than you would expect from pricer establishments.Don't know breakfast was included until we checked in, a real bonus, has strawberries to die for.White Horse pub looked and felt like an English pub, very popular with people walking in off the street.Car valet service, advised to expect 20 mins, sometimes quicker, sometimes slower, although parking out front could be a problem at times.Weather was quite cold during our visit, even for SF, so central heating was turned on some nights, not really needed, aircon easy to operate, open the window.One issue that needs sorting, ventilation or lack off in resturant/breakfast room. Had to open the fire exit doors each morning, not always popular, just to get some air.Overall, if in SF again will return and can certainly recommend as excellent value for money"
42,2073,"Jul 23 2007	A Gem for the Money Location 	This hotel is very &quot;European,&quot; meaning the rooms are not all uniform, it's comfortable, but not fancy &amp; it has a relatively small elevator, which did not bother us at all. Furthermore, a lot of Europeans seem to be guests. We paid the AAA rate of $108 a day &amp; stayed in room 716, top floor corner in the back, for 6 nights. It was not a small room &amp; had cross window ventilation &amp; it was quiet. We also stayed for one Thursday night in room 604, which was smaller w/ one window. It was ok, but definitely not as nice as 716. Both had queen beds. It seems that all the rooms have different sizes &amp; views(although I think there are no great views, but we weren't there for that). Of course, room 716 had more light than 604 because there were 2 windows. The staff was helpful &amp; friendly. The breakfast was fine for us. From 7-10 there was coffee, tea, cereal, juice, croissants &amp; pasteries &amp; fruit, including great strawberries. The best part about the hotel for us(besides the location, which is very central &amp; safe&amp; about 2 1/2 blocks from Union Sq.), was the White Horse Tavern/Pub on the 1st floor. We found it to be quaint, charming, reasonably priced, w/ good food &amp; very friendly. There is no a/c, which is normal in this city &amp; is not a problem unless you hit a heatwave. We didn't; it was about 65 every day. The parking was $24 a day, which is about average &amp; the only problem is that it is valet, so you do have to find a place to park for the valet(there is only 1 spot in front of the hotel for them. there are some meters &amp; you could park in front of the hotel next door if you had to. We didn't really have a problem w/ this, but we only had the car 3 days while we were there). Also, you have to call for your car 20 minutes before you want it. The bathrooms were not huge, but we made do. There seemed to be all types of people there from families, to couples, to friends, to single travelers. To sum up, if you're staying for more than 3 days, try to get a larger corner room. Overall, we just loved the place.Tips: There is a French Restaurant, Cafe Claude, nearby on a very small street (right before Kearny)Claude Lane, off Sutter, very French, good &amp; reasonable.  The Hotel Rex is nearby on Sutter w/ nice bar that reminded me of a small version of the Algonquin Hotel bar in NYC.  Also, you can catch the cable cars on Mason &amp; Sutter &amp;, I believe, Powell &amp; Sutter, not far from the hotel.If parking is an issue, there are several motels on Lombard St., near the Marina, that have free parking. They all seemed fine. One that I noticed was Cow Hollow Motor Inn."
43,2073,"Jul 22 2007 	The best of the old hotels?	We stayed at the Beresford after changing our plans for another hotel that did very poorly on Tripadvisor reviews. The location is great, especially if you have no car. Keep in mind that this is a heritage building. Much of the plasterwork is presevered. The hotel is like an older movie star - you are delighted to be in her prescence and are ready to forgive the odd wrinkle due to age. The reception was efficient including giving directions with a smile. A more than adequate self-serve breakfast was served in the historic lobby. The guest rooms are conversions but clean and well cared for. This is one of the more ecomonic hotels in San Fran and you get more than your money's worth."
44,2073,"Jul 15 2007 	This is a real find!!	If you want a good, clean, friendly, and very well located hotel in the heart of San Francisco close to Union Square then this is it.No frills, but what are you staying in the middle of this vibrant and bustling unique American city for? Rooms are clean, it is styled with an eye on perhaps better days but I quite liked the feeling the hotel has, and the rooms are well sized, and considering we stayed here for 8 nights it was comfortable, and definately where i will stay next time i am in San Francisco. Breakfast is laid out with pastries, croissants, cereals, coffee, and decaf, plus hot water and tea bags. Milk regular, and skimmed (they call it fat free), plus cream. Plenty of fresh fruit.Help yourself, and it can't be moaned about really. Set us up for a good days sight seeing, shopping, eating, drinking, and a good base.Its interesting looking at previous reviews. I might be tempted to say this hotel suits European/British travellers very well, but appears not to pander to some American visitors expectations, not sure why?"
45,2073,"Jun 1 2007 	Not the worst hotel ever...	...but nothing special. The hotel is very dated and dingy, with a funky smell throughout. Room was tolerable but not the cleanest. Way overpriced for what it was. If you just need a place to sleep and don't plan to spend any time in the room, it might be fine, otherwise, I'd look elsewhere."
46,2073,"May 26 2007 	location location location	This was our 1st visit to San Francisco. We chose the Beresford having seen details in the Lonely Planet and checking out their own website. I wanted somewhere central and thats exactly what I got - literally a couple of blocks from Union square and the cable cars. By American standards the rooms are small - but they are clean and lets face it the hotel is a base only, if you want the bells and whistles (which I never have time to use) then you need to be looking at one of the larger chains which have a much pricer rate. No aircon which could be a problem in the summer. Had breakfast one morning in the hotel and after that ate out - the cereals are a little too sweet for the english tastebuds and I wasn't keen on plastic plates ! According to him who must be obeyed (in his dreams) the Bloody Marys served in the bar are to recommendedHad a mini bar in the room which had a very reasonable dry white wine for $10 per bottle - although there a couple of shops a couple of doors away Several restaurants within easy walking distanceCan recomment Cesario's which is the Italian on the corner down the hill from the hotel. Don't make the mistake we did and try the one on the other side of the street and up the hill - which can be seen from the hotel enterance many of the staff did not speak english. I would consider using the Beresford again and we will be passing this info onto friends. Great value for money Finally book direct with the hotel via their website - we saved nearly 50% on the price quoted by a well known online booking agent - enjoy your time in San Francisco"
47,2073,"May 20 2007 	Visit SF not your hotel room	We were repeat visitors to the Beresford recently, this time to attend a graduation. Yes, the rooms are small and there are no views, but the price is right, the rooms are clean, the continental breakfast is free, and the front desk is helpful. If you're visiting SF to visit SF instead of to visit a hotel room, save some money by staying here and then treat yourself to a nice dinner. It's good enough, really it is."
48,2073,"May 13 2007 	Nightmare Room	There are many wonderful hotels in San Francisco with beautiful views, that are clean, quiet and that have comfortable beds. Hotel Beresford is not one of them.The lobby of this circa 1910 hotel is quaint and there is a charming little restaurant in one of the rooms where the continental breakfast (juice,cereal,fruit &amp; pastries) is held. Then there are the rooms....The first room they gave me had an unusual odor and when I opened the door, the blast from the noise in the street was too much. The street was very busy and there was some type of work being done so I asked for another room. But at least this one had a view out the window!My stay was for two nights, so I wanted it to be a pleasant experience. When I walked in to the second room, I thought someone had left the air conditioning on. There is no air conditioning. The window was open and since the days were about 60 at the highest, I wanted some heat. There is no heat, until the radiator comes on when the hotel decides. That's very late in the evening and in the morning. There's nothing you can do! So, they gave me a space heater. I was told when I wasn't using it to turn it off since it affects everyone elses electricity! Oh, and you have to ask for a blow dryer.The room (and other rooms on this side of the building) overlook some type of generator that stays on 24/7. That's why I thought the a/c was on, because it was so loud. It was impossible to get used to! Then the tiny refrigerator reset itself every few hours while I was asleep and woke me up. And to add insult to injury, when I finally fell asleep, someone had left the alarm on the night before which woke me up a couple of hours before I'd planned to wake up. But the neighbors shower and faucet would hhave woken me up anyway. I asked 3 times to be given a different room, but they never got back to me. So, I need to give this review so that you can pick someplace better. The location was very good and the price. But you get what you pay for. Oh, I forgot to mention that my &quot;view&quot; was of a brick wall of the building nnext door. However, there is a small Italian restaurant at the corner of this hotel, that is absolutely outstanding. From the bread, to the meal to the service, this is a wonderful restaurant.Enjoy S.F.!"
49,2073,"May 2 2007	Exactly what you need in San Francisco	Excellent Hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's exactly where you want to be when you are in San Francisco! You are IN Union Square a few meters from all the stores and shopping you could ever want. As well, you are 2 blocks from the historic tram which will take you directly to Fisherman's Wharf. It's walking distance to Chinatown, North Beach, the museums and even Fisherman's Wharf if you so choose. The hotel itself was much better than I expected given the very affordable price. The room was big enough and very clean, the bathroom was very adequate and the staff were helpful. There was a very reasonably priced mini bar in the room, which made it actually worth it. There is a breakfast, but it is very mediocre.The only small glitch is that the hotel restaurant closes its kitchen at 9:30. So if after a full day of traipsing around the wonderful city that is San Francisco you just want to grab a quick soup or salad before bed, the hotel restaurant will not be able to provide that for you.Otherwise would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family for sure!"
50,2073,"Apr 26 2007	Clean and neat but tiny rroms	My wife and I recently attended a play in SF (&quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, terrific) and wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the theatre district; the Beresford Hotel filled the bill. Our room on the 5th floor was clean and quiet but pretty small; the queen bed practically filled the room and the bathroom was about the smallest we've seen. Not that it was uncomfortable, just tiny! The staff was polite and helpful, the included breakfast was about what you'd expect: cereals, sweet rolls, some fruit, coffee and teas. Parking is avaliable on the same block at the Olympic Club ($30). We booked directly with the hotel for $98.75 plus tax. For our purposes, it was just fine; after all, when you're in San Francisco, how much time do you spend in your hotel room?"
51,2073,"Mar 13 2007 	Good stop but only for a day...	Being the first time I have ever visited San Francisco, I chose the Beresford for it's reasonable price and convenient location. I stayed for two nights and was given a relatively small room with two twin size beds (Remember, we are in American right now, therefore we must acknowledge that Americans like big beds as well as big everything!). The outside window view faced the street (unlike some viewers who had mentioned getting a view with a wall?!?). The bathroom was also very small (I really had to be careful where I stretched my arms...even though I'm slender built), but very clean. I think the one thing I was a little unhappy about was the service. One website described this hotel as having &quot;a pleasant atmosphere&quot; but I didn't see that at all. Whenever I asked the lady (who was probably the owner and I saw almost everyday at the hotel) at the front desk some questions, she didn't really give me an answer. She just kind of looked at me funny like I just asked an unusual question and then gave me an answer...a blunt answer I must add. I'm in the hospitality industry so when I come across service like this, I can only say that it will only hinder your business if you speak to your guests like that. Next time I go to San Francisco, I will stay somewhere else even if I have to pay a little more."
52,2073,"Feb 16 2007 	Great value for the location	My husband stayed at the Hotel Beresford for a weekend stay in San Francisco. This hotel is in walking distance to Union Square. This hotel was great for a short trip in San Francisco. A breakfast of cereals, fruit and pastries is provided in the adjacent pub each morning. The rooms are supplied with nice soaps and the shower is the strongest I have ever seen. The room had a television with just a few stations. We were able to park our car at the hotel for around $24/day. However, it did take some time for the staff to take the car and we were concerned about getting a ticket as we parked at a meter just outside the hotel. Be sure to try out Foley's Irish House on O'Farrel just a few blocks away off Union Square. If you want to ride the trolley you can pick it up at Union Square and take it down to the wharf."
53,2073,"Jan 29 2007 	more than adequate	the hotel beresford was perfect for us. nice room, very nice bathroom, above average continental breakfast, helpful staff, perfect location for exploring sf."
54,2073,"Jan 29 2007	Best Kept Secret Of San Francisco	On My First trip to S.F. I booked a room for seven days at the St. Regis, I was totally disappointed especially at nearly $400.00 a night, the room was small and outdated and there was an odor, I met a local who told me about the Hotel Beresford, so I went there and checked it out and liked what I saw. the room looked about the same as that of the St. Regis, in size and furnishings, and at a special rate that the front desk gave me of $59.00 a night, I checked out of the St. Francis who then offered to move me to a suite . But as far as I was concerned at 400.00 dollars a night, I should have been there in the first place. Off to the Beresford I went and each year when I travel to S.F. I stay there, and I am also greeted with upon entering my room and fruit and wine basket with a card that reads WELCOME BACK!"
55,2073,"Oct 11 2006 	Clean with OK breakfast	Two blocks down from the Union sq, also a couple of blocks away from China town.Safe and comfortable area for walks any time. Room size was great for one person, but two migh struggle a bit.Don't expect views as the rooms are facing sideways.Coming from England it definitely has some old fashioned british charm, the only real issue i had with the hotel was the smell in the main lobby. Otherwise as long as you don't expect miracles and are realistic about hotels in the area, a good and affordable place to stay in Frisco.If you want a transfer to the international airport the hotel will organise this for you for $14, bargain!!!"
56,2073,"Oct 4 2006 	Everything we needed at a bargain price!	At a &quot;Manager's Special &quot; price of $106 from the hotel's website, we had low expectations, but booked because of the location and price. It turned out to be a great stay- our room (519) was at the back of the hotel- very quiet . The decor is rather Victorian with red carpeted halls and gold and white walls covered with historic photos.. Our room was small but spotless and had everything one could have needed. There was a fan in the closet if required as most hotels in SF don't provide air conditioning, which is almost never needed. Our room had a bed, 2 nightstands, 2 chairs and a side table between, a 5 drawer chest and a tv on a stand. We had a small clean bath room with a stall shower but no tub, which we didn't require. There were nice toiletries provided , as well as a mini fridge fully stocked and even two real wine glasses.The hotel was so quiet we almost swore we were the only occupants, but we met some other travellers in the morning at the continental breakfast served in the restaurant. Three types of cereal, crissants, assorted pasteries, oj and a variety of really prime fresh fruit ( most mornings, apples, bananas, oranges. dates and fresh strawberries) as well as coffee, tea and chocolate were more than adequate for us. Every employee we encountered smiled and greeted us warmly. The hotel is convenient to Union Square - we walked the few blocks from the BART Station with our roller bags and took a bus back from the Ferry Building one day that stopped at the door.I can't think of anything we would have changed about our stay. There are numerable well known restaurants within a few blocks ( like the famous Sears) and the immediate area is home to an art school , so lots of galleries and the like. We felt perfectly safe walking around.If you have traveled in Europe and understand and appreciate small, well maintained , budget hotels, you will appreciate the Beresford. We'd return without question."
57,2073,"Oct 4 2006	Good location but basic.	Stayed here 3 nights as part of tour group. Was given wrong key and I went into someone elses room! Then given key that would not work. Eventually sorted but not a good start. Room very dark, fussy, and awful old fashioned decor. Very small with 2 small single beds. No air con and window that just faced a wall a few feet away so stuffy. Tiny bathroom. Just a shower. No hairdryer or coffee maker. Limited tv channels. So not a room to spend time relaxing in. The one good thing going for it was that it was just around the corner from Union Square and Macys, and there were not as many beggers in the area as elsewhere in the city."
58,2073,"Sep 29 2006 	Great little hotel near Union Square	San Francisco hotels generally represent good value. I came to that conclusion recently after searching for a hotel in New York for a trip next year. My room at the Beresford was $98. No doubt the same room in NYC would go for $250-300. Even a 4-star hotel in SF costs less than a room in an average hotel in Manhattan. But anyway, getting back to the Beresford: I've stayed in several hotels in the Union Square area and this was the nicest experience I've had. The hotel is in an old 7-story building in a great neighborhood, next to the Marines Memorial Theater and a 5 min walk to Union Square, Chinatown or Market Street shopping. Very friendly service from all staff members. A nice mix of guests, some on business and lots of tourists. The hotel seemed pretty quiet at night but just to be safe I requested a room on the top floor at the back, and had a great night. My room was small, about 10 x 10, but ample room for a solo traveller. Carpet was a bit worn but all furniture and fixtures were in great shape. On a hot summer night the room might get a little stuffy--there was a fan stored in the closet for this purpose. There's a great little tavern and restaurant on the premises. I didn't have dinner there but I enjoyed eating breakfast the next morning at a table with a view of Sutter St. The breakfast wasn't much, just cereal fruit pastry and juice, but it was adequate. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone--except families on vacation. For groups of 4 or more I would seek larger quarters. But for anyone else this hotel is a great choice."
59,2073,"Jul 21 2006 	As Expected	After reading many reviews on the 'net, we decided to try the Beresford Hotel. Since we were just meeting a friend and needed a place to sleep, I wasn't looking for anything fancy. Generally, the hotel was exactly what I expected. It is an older hotel, but the staff was friendly and it is in a great location. Upon arrival, we were asked to double park in front of the hotel while the valet parking attendant arrived (15-20 minutes). It was traffic hour and we did not feel comfortable doing this, so that caused some tension for the employee who was in charge of this....but he found a place for us in front of a nearby garage temporarily. Other than that, all employee's were very friendly. The hotel looks nice even though the decor has not been refurbished for some time. Going up to our room, there was an &quot;old&quot; smell. I am very sensitive to smells, so this was a little bothersome for me. My husband said he liked it and it reminded him of his grandparents home. The decor of the hotel is outdated: older - but good quality and clean carpet, wall paper, etc. Our room was clean. We asked for two twin beds because this hotel does not have King or queen beds, and the two of us on a double just didn't sound good. The beds were comfortable, more so for me I think, as I am small. The bathroom was basic, but fine. There was shampoo, conditioner and soap available. I asked for a QUIET room, as I don't like to be interupted when I sleep, so they put us on the 6th floor facing a non-vehicle alley which was, indeed, quiet. Breakfast consisted of Cold cereal (3 choices), whole fruits (oranges, apples and bananas), tea, coffee, juice and cocoa, and pastries (croissants and swirl fruit-in-the-center type). The surrounding area of the hotel is fine - I felt perfectly safe walking at night.Overall, the hotel is fine for an overnight stay. If you are expecting plush new accommodations where you will enjoy hanging out in your room, this is not the place for you. But if you are ok with the basics, this hotel will do. San Francisco usually has somewhat higher prices for hotels, so for the money this place is acceptable. In the future if I had the time, I would keep looking for a better deal, but if this is where I ended up I would be ok with that too."
60,2073,"Feb 9 2006 	clean but minimal	We just returned from the Hotel Beresford which is well located near Union Square. The hotel was worn, but fairly clean. The room was tiny. The queen sized bed had shabby linens and a creaky headboard. The small bathroom had a shower, with no bathtub, shower cap or even a hair dryer. The staff was pleasant, however we had to wait a long time for our car, and parking was $20 extra. There is no air conditioning so we had the windows wide open, which was great except for the construction crew that started working very loudly, just below our room at 7:30 am. We've stayed in San Francisco a lot - you can do better than this."
61,2073,"Feb 7 2006	Great Room Great Price	My wife and I went out to San Francisco on our honeymoon. We stayed at the Hotel Beresford for three nights. Our corner double room was ideal for us. While the room was smallish, it was all that we needed. The bed was a very comfortable Queen. Mainly what we liked was the price. With our AAA discount the price of the room was less than $90! For a hotel just off Union Square in San Francisco that was a steal. The room came with a complimentary continental breakfast and the service in the hotel was first-rate: the concierge was helpful and effecient, check-in and check-out were both handled with no fuss and the cleaning service never missed a step.The cons for this hotel are the size of the rooms and the bathrooms in the rooms. We had a small shower with no tub and a very loud toilet, so loud that you couldn't talk while it was filling the tank. This was such a minor problem that it doesn't really affect the review. If you want a good, inexpensive hotel room near Union Square in San Francisco, try the Hotel Beresford."
62,2073,"Dec 6 2005	a horrible experience	I booked this hotel through Expedia when I arrived the room was nothing like I expected close cramped quarters,asked for a view looked out onto a brick wall. Freezing cold in room called and asked about the heat was told it comes on about 8:00 at night and that we have no control over it. You either froze or roasted no choice. The wall paper was coming off the walls the bathroom was in need of a complete remodel and the carpet in the room was absolutely filthy. To top it off my daughter was burned by the radiator heater when the cap blew off and steam was bursting all over in our room for over 5 minutes called down and told them we had a emergency and to turn the heater off they did not even bother to come upstairs and check this out. My daughter had her hand in a ice bucket the rest of the night. My daughter is 32 years old when she went down to get ice they were not the least concerned ablsolutely would never ever ever stay there again Marcia Wagner"
63,2073,"Nov 25 2005	Very Pleasant	After reading some of the reviews, I was more than a little concerned to find that there was no AC since I am very affected by heat.No problem, I just opened the window and all was fine.My husband and I loved this hotel! In addition to a great rate, the location was fantastic, the hotel personnel were very pleasant and helpful, and the free continental breakfast was more than adequate.The room reminded us of hotels in France, only larger, and had an honor bar. We always travel with our Yorkie, and she was accepted with no problem. We will most definitely stay at this hotel again if/when we travel to San Francisco."
64,2073,"Oct 9 2005	Would stay here again	What a find! My partner and I stayed here the last two weeks in September. We'd been to SF before, so knew we wanted to stay in this area but didn't want to pay $$$$ for a room we were only going to sleep and wash in.Mostly in response to many of the negative comments I've read about this hotel:- Yes, the room was small. But it was adequate, clean, had a comfortable bed, bedlinen and towels were changed daily.Yes, the bathroom was tiny. But it had a great shower (and who needs bathtubs when they're only 5&quot; deep anyway?!), and we never had any issues with low water pressure or availability of hot water.Yes, we had no view but come on, people: what do you expect in the middle of a city unless you stay at a high-rise hotel?The continental breakfast was good as far as we saw as we didn't always use it, although the coffee was sometimes a bit weak.The mini-bar was well stocked and VERY reasonably priced. More to the point, it gave us a fridge to keep our own drinks in.We found the staff friendly and helpful (they even got us a limo at cab prices to go to the airport when we left!); the situation of the hotel is excellent and at $89 + tax we thought it was above average for that price range. (And the price left us lots of $$ for spending, given the /$ exchange rate ;-))The only negative thing about the area was the noise, but that seemed to be almost entirely due to the considerable amounts of building work going on to the west of Union Square, and only affected us - marginally at that - early mornings.We'll happily stay here again."
65,2073,"Sep 22 2005	Good Value for Money	I was a little worried after reading the reviews, but went with it as I am budget-minded. True, the hallway smelled funky, but I noticed the same smell emanating from other older hotels as I walked by. (Hotel Beresford was built in 1911). The hall windows were opened &amp; closed each morning by the staff to help. No air con, but there was an unusual cold snap &amp; A/C wasn't needed. The heat was supplied by what looked to be the original steam radiators-quite an interesting sight for this Floridian. The room was a bit small. Bathroom was shower (no tub). The window looked out at the building next door, but I don't book a room based on view. One computer with free access for all-other guests were quite reasonable and shared so it was not a problem checking e mail a couple of times. And the White Horse Tavern has a meat loaf that we talked about for 2 days-it's different but delicious! The front desk &amp; all other staff were pleasant and accommodating. Had to transfer to another (more expensive) hotel for business and within 24 hours was wishing for the unpretentious atmosphere of this place. I would stay here again."
66,2073,"Sep 21 2005 	Highly Recommended	I'm staying at the hotel right this minute and it is a God-send. Only vacancy I could find near Union Square and not only is the price really great ($89 a night), but it is nice. Most pleasant, beautiful lobby, marbeled elevator, what looks to be a newly renovated room. The staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. The area is good, since the Hilton is just a block away. Nicely stocked minibar at the most reasonable prices I have ever seen. Rooms are very clean, and mine is quiet and peaceful. I highly recommend it, and I'll probably stay here every time I have to visit SF from now on. Valet parking is $20 a night, about average for SF, and they sure make it easy to leave your car -- it's quick. If this is a budget hotel, then they should all be this nice. The room has more room than I was expecting from other reviews. There is a seating area as well as all of the basics. The bed is really comfortable."
67,2073,"Aug 24 2005	Good for location price etc.	All the negative reviews of this hotel are off-base! You pay $89-$125 a night and expect Waldorf Astoria ambiance and service. This hotel is great for the price, location (within walking distance of Union Square, Chinatown, etc.) Heck the girlfriend and I walked to Fisherman's Wharf from there. The rooms are on the small side but this is ten times better than any of the cheap-y motels by the airport and if you are really cheap there are a ton of hostels in the area! But if you want luxury then the Omni, Hilton, or any other 3 to 4 star hotel will do. This place was assigned 2 stars for a reason. Anyway it's clean, serviceable and the people are nice. What else could you want?"

Still, staff all very pleasant. Room a good size with great big bath - probably the best thing about the room) We had a twin room with plenty of space. 10 mins in a cab from Union Square or a 20 min bus ride from just outside. Only had room so no idea what the restaurant is like. Filmore St a few mins walk up the roab with interesting shops + restaurants."
2,2085,"Nov 18 2009 	A Great Place with Kids	My husband and I stayed at Hotel Kabuki-formerly Hotel Miyako-During chilly July 07 with our 3 month old and my mother. Our first family vacation and it was wonderful. At first I was hesitant to stay in Japantown, just ignorant really, but it was such a nice surprise!  Finding the hotle was a snap, but parking was valet only $35/day at the time. Check-in took about 5 minutes, really quick, and the elevator whisked us up to our rooms. We stayed in a Deluxe View Corner King room with a beautiful view-instead of curtains we had shoji screns for window coverings which are excellent blackout screens. My mom was across the hall in her own King room with a view. We were visiting during a construction phase, but you would never know. We seemed to be separated from any guests, I think we were the only guests on our floor, and that was fine with us-peace and quiet with our baby! They provided a crib for us, just a basic drop side, and since she didn't move around at all, we were not worried about crib recalls. The King bed was huge, bigger than a normal king-maybe a California King :) and we slept very peacefully in the nice bedding and pillows. The TV was nice, but I think they have updated to LCD TV's since our trip. The bathroom with the huge/deep soaking tub was a treat. Even the baby enjoyed her Japanese baths!The restaurant/lounge was not open during the construction, so we went to the mall and ate at BennyHanna's and the Sushi Boat in the Miyako Mall. The area outdoors is very nicely manicured: Peace Garden and Koi Pond. and there are several shops, restaurants (Pizza, Denny's), art galleries within walking distance, but be aware that it is hilly and steep, 4-6 blocks feels like 10 on those inclines! The amenities were scarce when we were there, no spa or in room services, no pool-still no pool, but we did have wireless internet and a morning paper.Very Kid friendly hotel: always greeting us and asking if we needed anything for the baby. And we did end up buying formula/diapers at a local Japanese market-just like a local Dallas maket with more Japanese variety, but they did carry Similac and Pampers. We walked a lot on the trip and San Fran in general is a great stroller city. Wine country/Napa not so much. Who takes their baby on a wine tour anyway?!? That's right we did, but it was OK.All in all, I would love to go back to see the updated version of this property. It was very nice and clean and steeped in Japanese decor,and I would like to see all the new amenities and room improvements."
3,2085,"Nov 16 2009 	Lovely hotel in Japantown	We chose the Kabuki for a short visit to San Francisco as it is away from the noise and confusion of the central city area. We chose a room on the club floor, and were extremely pleased- the room was large, clean, and quiet. The Japanese screens covering the windows gave an intimate feel, but could be opened to let in sunlight in the daytime. Our rate on the club floor included a continental breakfast, which added to the value we received. Parking in the underground garage was easy to access and decently priced at $16. Staff was pleasant and accommodating. We will definitely stay in this hotel again."
4,2085,"Nov 16 2009 	Room size layout view and furnishings were excellent as is its location.	After staying in several San Francisco hotels during the past 15 years while visitng our daughter, we've settled on the Kabuki as our best choice, particularly since its renovation and expansion a couple years ago. Cleanliness, size, furnishings and genial service as well as its location, all for reasonable rates, have made it a pleasure for us during our three-to-five-day visits. Importantly, although the hotel charges for parking, we've never failed to find free overnight street parking within a block or two of the hotel, and often can stay parked for several hours on the street the next morning at no charge."
5,2085,"Nov 15 2009 	Always a pleasure	We stayed here last week for my birthday. The front desk upgraded me to a bigger room without me asking. The parking is very reasonable and safe at 16.00 a night. You are in the perfect location to walk to the Filmore, Polk Russian hill, and some of the most beautiful parts of SF. Japan town is such a wonderful place to explore. There are so many shops and delicious places to eat. I am always more than happy to stay at Hotel kabuki. The rooms are stunning and the service is outstanding. How can you beat the amazingly romantic views from your window. This is the place I most like to stay when I'm in San Francisco."
6,2085,"Oct 30 2009 	First of Many Future Stays at Hotel Kabuki	Charming Japanese style hotel in charming Japan Town. Painted screens create huge murals on the walls, and roll back to reveal huge windows. Love the deep Japanese style tub and the bath salts - made for a relaxing bath after pounding the SF pavement all day and night! Yes, if you spend your vacation inspecting every inch of the rooms, you may see the hotel showing its age. But for half the cost of a downtown hotel, in a much more unique (but central) neighborhood, its well worth it! We also didn't get the welcome tea and agree the breakfast buffet was forgettable, but still appreciate the friendly service and great value.Don't miss the amazing restaurant Bushi-Tei across the street. Expensive but worth the splurge for incredibly fresh, delicious and creative dishes. So many charming little restaurants, shops, bookstores to discover in this area. We had a strenuous but much needed Thai massage nearby. Did I mention that this area is so charming?! :)"
7,2085,"Oct 30 2009 	Fantastic hotel	Great hotel, close enough to the action. This Japanese-style hotel had great rooms. Everything was spotless and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous."
8,2085,"Oct 28 2009 	Loved it!	My first trip to San Francisco and I picked this hotel because I got a great deal. I loved the neighborhood (Japantown), it was not as busy as most of the city, quieter, safer, surrounded by great Japanese restaurants, and always had at least 3 cabs waiting outside to wisk us away to the clubs. My next trip to SF I will definitely stay there again!"
9,2085,"Oct 22 2009 	Hotel not as expected.	On the Hotel's website they state the hotel recently remodeled and updated. The rooms looked nothing like the photos on the website. The first room was smelly, small, had broken fixtures in the bathroom,and a smoke detector falling from the ceiling. we complained. The second room while it was bigger and did not smell, had peeling wallpaper, broken closet doors,sink faucet that leaked, broken thermostat so it was either too cold or too hot, and extremely noisy even with the windows closed. There was no dresser to put our clothes in(we stayed for a week) and no table(had to eat sitting on the bed). The Hotel has yet to respond to my letter of complaint. I will not book this Hotel again nor recommend this place to any one."
10,2085,"Oct 18 2009 	Wonderful Stay at the Kabuki Hotel	We had a wonderful 5-night stay at the Kabuki. Our room was quite large with beautiful shoji screens. We had gotten it on booking.com for $109 a night. We liked the location since it is right on the bus line and not as &quot;noisy and busy&quot; as the center of San Francisco. We had a car which we parked next door for $16 a day but decided to use public transport in the city. One morning we had their buffet breakfast which was quite good. For dinner, there is an excellent chinese restaurant across the street, called San Wang with low prices, large portions, and excellent food."
11,2085,Oct 17 2009 	Bring your expectations down a notch	Thought this would be a nicer place all around. Restaurant in the hotel was closed more than it was open...so forget room service. Attention to details in the room was spotty. Location of the hotel is great and it was quiet and felt comfortably small.
12,2085,"Oct 12 2009 	Cheap makeover Big disappointment	I was initially very excited to book the Kabuki, having become addicted to JDV hotels, the Vitale in particular! The hotel rooms however look nothing like the glossy pictures and were a huge, huge disappointment!On arrival the hotel seemed very understaffed, a que at the front desk and one porter in sight who was busy with a wedding guest. When we got out of the lift (which needed a clean!) there was a dirty glass in clear view on the table opposite the lift. This took the staff 2 days to remove, even after a complaint to the manager!The hotel room itself was an extremely poorly, cheaply and quickly made over room with what looked like dirty old 1970 fixtures, heavily artexed ceiling and yellowing pipes remaining, tatty wooden frames cracked and decaying around the windows and doors, just painted over. window screens made from what looked like unfinished garden trelless fitted with card.Light bulbs in the bathroom worked intermittently, we had a shower which looked 10 years old, missing it's dial cover and a toilet which you could hear flush from room above and below.In the fridge there was a drink of aloe juice which had been opened, half drunk and returned to the fridge.We had a burnt through dirty stained lamp shade. Disgusting dirty windows and old metal sliding door which didn't slide, in fact one wouldn't open at all! The balcony was no more than 1ft deep with dirty fake grass matting all over it.The air filters looked so dirty we slept with the door open at night rather than use the aircon. The bed was comfortable yet made up with sheets which had been turned back to reveal multiple holes and a blood mark.Paper was peeling off the walls in areas and patches had been placed where items had been moved on the wall to cover holes. They even left pencil lines over one wall where they had been measuring where to hang frames. The views were the only redeeming feature, yet if you don't like the thought of being between a main road and a dual carriageway I would say you may not enjoy them.We did make a complaint the first day we were there and were shown rooms on higher floors which had identical problems. The guy who showed us offered an excuse/ explanation for the poor state of the rooms &quot;this building is over 50 years old&quot;, not the explanation or solution I was looking for!If we had not paid in full up front I would have left immediately. The sheets got changed but the room was depressing. I felt stupid and conned for booking this place and we spent as much time away as possible.The business centre was also the only one of 5 hotels we stayed at on a 3 week trip that charged for using the internet.Please look at some visitors pictures to see the reality"
13,2085,"Oct 9 2009 	OK experience...Offered more than they could deliever...	Location in Japan Town was excellent and close to great food and culture. Hotel was OK but nothing out of the ordinary. Lobby and Garden were as described and quite beautiful but the rooms were basic and standard at best. My number one complaint was the popcorn ceiling. Really?...in this day and age? Scrape that old stuff off! The bathroom perplexed w/too many doors that actually hit each other if opened all at once. The restaurant had great decor but the Sunday breakfast buffet was forgettable. $18 dollars for powdered eggs? Luckily, we were there for the City and not the Hotel. But, would have liked to have been 'Wowed'. One last thing...the advertised 'welcoming tea' was non-existent. :-("
14,2085,"Oct 8 2009 	Fabulous place in Japantown	We stayed here with our 6 and 9 year old boys in a corner king room with a rocking view of the city and sliding door that opened along two walls. Our boys loved it! They love hotels in general but this one got a big thumbs up from them for its uniqueness...the deep soaking tub, the sliding doors, the chaise lounge and the Japan town mall attached to the hotel. Plus if you join the Joie De Vrie club you get email rates. We got this room for $111 in a city where rates run much higher."
15,2085,"Oct 8 2009	Lovely but glad we had a discount code	Found a great rate via their facebook page &amp; so glad we did...Pro: wonderful location, comfy bed with crisp linens, great shower pressure &amp; a nice flat screen / Cons: smaller than expected room (fine but low frills &amp; nowhere near five star) &amp; no soaking tub, so be sure to ask if that's what you wantOverall, a lovely stay, especially for the price &amp; will definitely return when in San Francisco. Especially with a discount code from twitter or facebook. Enjoy!"
16,2085,Oct 8 2009 	A Japanese Experience in the Heart of San Francisco	We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Hotel Kabuki. The service was friendly and warm when we arrived to the hotel. We felt as if we stepped into a hotel in Japan. There was a beautiful japanese garden in the lobby and the rooms had rice paper screens and a japanese bath tub. The hotel is located next to Japantown which provided us good restaurants and shopping.
17,2085,"Oct 8 2009 	Loved the Kabuki!	We got a good deal on a pre-paid room at the Hotel Kabuki and were very satisfied. We had a corner room on the 10th floor with great views of the city. The location was nice, it was an easy walk to Union Square, but far enough that it was much quieter. Lots of great Japanese restaurants in the area. If traveling with a car, don't bother with the valet parking at the hotel. The adjacent mall has underground parking that allows you to enter from the basement of hotel without even going outside."
18,2085,"Oct 8 2009 	If you find an internet deal grab it and enjoy your stay at an upscale Japanese hotel	Through an internet special, we got a &quot;deluxe view king room&quot; for $85/night, and for that price, our stay was amazing. Japantown is a quieter area of the city (though it does have a nice mall with well-priced Asian eats), but it is centrally located, so we found it easy to walk to the sections we wanted to explore. The hotel staff were very kind, and our room was elegantly decorated. Our only complaint was that the shower head was pretty low, so watch out if you're on the tall side! We ordered room service one morning, and the food was fine, but nothing compared to the places we ate out at other mornings. I would definitely stay there again if I could find a comparable deal."
19,2085,"Oct 7 2009 	Never again!	I go to San Francisco fairly often for business and usually stay at the JW Marriott. Just for a change of pace, I thought I'd try the Hotel Kabuki because it advertised Japanese style rooms AND FREE INTERNET ACCESS. I also signed up for the Joie De Vivre program (their version of the points program) before booking. They have you fill out a form listing your preferences, including whether you'd like water, white wine, or red wine upon arrival. I don't drink, so I selected water. But when I arrived, I was told that I only had a choice of wines -- that the hotel was out of water! How can a hotel be out of bottled water?! So I asked if I could just have a Diet Coke, but the front desk said &quot;no&quot;. I was told that if I wanted a Diet Coke or bottled water, that I could purchase it from the Honor Bar. So they promised water (can this be more simple?), claim to be out, then say that I have to buy it from the Bar. It gets worse. I booked the Japanese suite. The hotel advertises free internet access and internet access is a must for my business. Only there was no cable in the room and the wifi had very limited range. I spent an HOUR on the phone with various levels of tech support, all to no avail. They finally moved me to another room, where I finally had sporadic internet access. The Japanese theme is quaint, but the rooms are very outdated, bathroom tiles are chipped, even the top of the toilet was chipped. I'm 5'7&quot;, but the shower head was WAY too low, and yet the sink was so high that I had to stand on my toes to wash my face! The bathroom looked like it hadnt been updated since at least the 1980's. The only &quot;cute&quot; thing about it was the flip down scale (I thought it was a radiator). That must be from the 1950's. One of the tatami mats had a huge worn through area."
20,2085,"Oct 6 2009 	Great Value for reasonable price	When we first got into San Francisco, we booked &quot;The Mosser&quot; hotel. It was in primal location, but rooms were tiny...very tiny. It pretty much doesn't contain much else beside a double bed. My boyfriend and I each had a mid to full size luggage, and there was no room for us to lay down both luggages on the floor. Every morning getting dressed was a struggle. So we decided to look for somewhere else, and that's how we moved into Hotel Kabuki.For $30 more for one night, you get ten times of comfort. The rooms are much much bigger. It can fit in a king size bed, a writing desk, a full size bathroom with separate shower and bath, and there is still ton of room to spare! Now we can finally lay down both luggages and still able to walk around.It's only 10 minutes bus ride to Union Square. With the 3-day Muni passport, we don't have to worry about getting the exact change. Also the hotel is very close to a major road &quot;Geary&quot;, so buses are frequent, we rarely have to wait for more than 5 minutes for a bus.  The King size bed with 400 thread count sheets was so comfortable, every night we have slept like babies since we got here. Bathroom has a nice decor, but the hot water for the shower takes a round 3 minutes to actually get hot - but that maybe it's just our room? There are tons of restaurants around here - mostly Japanese food. It's in Japantown after all. A lot of cute shops nearby where you can get some Japanese arts and crafts. It's a quite neighborhood, definitely not as lively as Union Square, but why would you want to hear other people partying when you go to sleep?"
21,2085,"Oct 2 2009 	Wonderful Hotel	We had a wonderful time here. We stayed during the week, meaning prices were lower and we got a 4-night deal so it was even less. We had a room on the 16th floor and we could see the Golden Gate on a clear day, beautiful view. Parking is relatively cheap compared to the rest of the city, they have a garage next door with direct access to the hotel elevators at $16 for 24 hours. For the rest of the trip we took advantage of the MUNI system (google &quot;MUNI 511&quot; for planning which ones to take that day) which was pretty easy and had several stops near the hotel for ease - we went to Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Park, the Bridge, Union Square, the Port, Market Street, Fishermans Wharf, and Ghirardelli Square using MUNI. Theres also a Safeway nearby for a cheap dinner in your room. Lots of restaurants nearby as well (mostly Japanese of course). The fridge in the room is kinda small but does fit breakfast items to save a litle money. The shower was really cool, just keep your towel/clothes off the floor or they will be soaked. My one complaint is that we could not control our own room temperature, or at least we couldnt figure out how. We are warm sleepers and it seems the hotel has the system switched to &quot;heat&quot; after a certain hour, which was no good for us (it was also September, still mildly warm outside). So we slept with the sliding door cracked and window covers pulled passed it. This also meant a little more noise coming in - I put cotton in my ears. Also, you share a balcony with the room next to you, so be careful about that. The room itself is cozy, if a little tight. But we were out all day so who cares. The bed and pillows were wonderful, we both loved it. They are pet friendly and we had our cat with us and they did not charge us a pet-fee (they may for dogs). The only reason we would not stay here again would be to experience somewhere else, though this hotel is just outside of &quot;downtown&quot; and so was quieter, but still within easy reach of all the things you want to do. :-) Oh yah, free internet too. And they did discontinue room service."
22,2085,"Oct 1 2009 	A hotel with a unique Japanese style	This hotel tries to beat the 'bland' with a Japanese theme. Carried through very well with deep bath tubs, washing stool and ladle in bathroom, tea-set, rice-paper/mural screens over windows, decor all in keeping. Rooms are large and well-equipped with comfy beds. Downside is that there is no door to vanity area and only glass door to bath, so not suitable if you want privacy. Also so-called balcony is only wide enough to stand on and ours also connected directly to next room."
23,2085,"Sep 27 2009 	A hotel in a quiet place submerged in a small local culture	At the end of a long day of urban hiking, returning to the Hotel Kabuki was like &quot;coming home.&quot; The area is quiet and in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of Union Square. At the same time, the hotel is directly connected to the Japan Center with several Japanese restaurants, bars and a few stores. There are also a couple of restaurants across the street that were recommeded to us by a local San Franciscan (Korea House and a fusion restaurant, a couple of doors down from Korea House). The room was average size and offered a Japanese soaking tub, which was a much appreciated feature. The bed was incredibly comfortable.The beginning of the California cable car was a frequency starting point for our day. It is about 8 blocks or so from the hotel, and a nice walk. A cab from Union Square cost about $7 (sans tip).I would definitely stay here again. The area is peaceful. The experience was great and the hotel was easily accessible."
24,2085,"Sep 27 2009 	First Class	My husband and I stayed at Hotel Kabuki on a recent short vacation to SF. Thanks to a wonderful rate on Expedia, we enjoyed our stay in the King Club room for a price that ordinarily would have been much more expensive. We were a bit disappointed to hear that they've cut back on ammenities such as room service, tea service, and the advertised welcome sake, although not surprising due to the current economy. Despite this, we enjoyed the central location which is very near public transit (SF Muni) for easy travels around the city. Customer service, cleanliness, and ambience were top notch. Very peaceful and worth the return!"
25,2085,Sep 25 2009 	Great Hotel with Great Service	This Hotel met all my expectations. We stayed in a corner room which was very roomy and had awesome views of Japantown and surrounding areas. The room and bathroom were very clean and our maid did a wonderful job cleaning our room. The bathroom was very big and nice with a very deep tub. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very close to a safeway and a small japanese grocery store where you can pick up food and drinks to bring back. Also it was a 10 dollar cab ride to most places in the city because of the hotels central location. I highly reccomend it to anyone visiting SF.
26,2085,"Sep 21 2009 	Trendy Boutique Hotel	A lovely hotel in Japan Town. A $2 journey on Bus No. 38 to Union Square. Free Wi-Fi but no breakfast. Happy hour in bar/restaurant good value for money. Try 3 to 4 starters at half price ( tapas style ) washed down with a $3 pint of beer.. not bad. Bill, who looks after the bar is a mine of information and is pretty good at cocktails as well. Enjoyed our stay at this hotel &amp; would definitely recommend it.."
27,2085,"Sep 19 2009 	A gem	I fly often to San Francisco, mostly on business. My previous strategy was to use Expedia in order to get the best deal on a random reasonably located hotel in reasonable condition. After sampling a number of hotels that way I've changed my strategy and have settled on the Hotel Kabuki as my go-to location in San Francisco and I now book it directly with the Joie de Vivre chain which is more advantageous than going through a travel bundler. Like other reviewers who like this hotel, I enjoy the Japanese style bathroom with it's soaking tub. I also enjoy other Japanese touches such as the meditation garden, room decor, and tie-in to a nearby spa. It seemed to me that the cleaning people did a more thorough job than at most mid-price hotels. I also was well treated by all staff. As a business traveler, I very much appreciate the free high speed internet -- it's a pet peeve of mine when hotels charge (sometimes outrageous) amounts for that."
28,2085,"Sep 17 2009 	Relaxing stay	I really liked this hotel. Loving all things Japanese just added to the pleasure from the Japanese gardens on the property to the location in Japantown. The beds are large and comfy, the room is spacious and what a bathroom. I particularly loved the deep Japanese tubs. After a looooong day of sight seeing up and down horrid &quot;hills&quot; (I think they're mountains!) there's nothing better then to relax in one of these tubs. Very pleasant stay. One complaint was the balcony was a bit small. I would stay here again and again."
29,2085,"Sep 17 2009 	Fun experience	The Kabuki hotel is a great location when visiting Japantown (check out the cute shops in the nearby Japanese mall) and close to the trendy shops on Filmore str. However, it is a bit far from everything else a SF tourist might want to see. The room was nicely decorated in true Japanese style without being too kitschy. Parking was easy in the underground parking garage."
30,2085,Sep 15 2009 	Quite and Safe	I loved that the hotel seems to be in a quiet and safe location. Good sized rooms and bath rooms. The only thing that really bothered me is the amount of mold behind the overflow drain in the bathtub. Ew.
31,2085,Sep 15 2009 	Good place great service 1 hiccup	Beautiful property in the middle of Japan town. Hotel staff was always helpful and pleasant. There was one problem with the final bill; one email to the General Manager and I received a prompt and professional reply that satisfactorily addressed the issue.
32,2085,"Sep 5 2009 	Unique comfortable hotel in good location	I stayed there 3 nights with my husband, 4 year old son and 20 year old nephew. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Doormen were hit or miss. One in particular was very attentive and friendly. Others somewhat aloof. The lobby is sublime as is the garden. The rooms are well designed but a little outdated. The location is great; away from the hustle &amp; bustle of downtown. The bus is conveniently located a block away making Golden Gate park, Ocean Beach or downtown easily accessible. Several restaurants on Geary were kid friendly and delivered. Great parks/ playgrounds in nearby Pacific Heights. The Kabuki Sundance theater &amp; Yoshi's Jazz club are within walking distance. Perhaps best of all the associated Kabuki Spa &amp; Springs takes relaxation to a whole new level and it is only a short walk away. Would be great for a romantic getaway or a girls's weekend as well."
33,2085,"Sep 5 2009 	Nice end to our Roadtrip honeymoon	Bought our stay online 4 days before we arrived in San Francisco at the end of a month long coast to coast roadtrip. Got a great price but would've paid more if we'd had to...We had a lovely 2 nights here, it's in Japantown and therefore is a good location to get to most places.The room was comfortable... nice big bed decent size bathroom. We splurged on room service breakfast and it was lovely ... even if they did get our order slightly wrong! But we were leaving for the airport that morning and therefore didn't return it due to time but i'm sure it wouldn't have been a problem as the service was excellent!The restaurant is worth a visit and the menu is a japanese/western mix... I can recommend the burger!We used the valet parking as we had a hired mustang convertible and wanted it looked after, the other parking is a short walk away, looks safe enough but we decided not to take that chance! The valets were attentive and informative about where to go and what to do!Overall a good place to stay!"
34,2085,"Sep 1 2009 	Fabulous !	We were here for 5 nights. We loved it !!! The staff were great, front desk, &amp; door man.So many people complained about the price of food in the bar/ restraurant. We found it average and the food was wonderful. Every night we tried something new. Had a great happy hour. :) Right next door to the small mall. Every morning we walked over to the 3 bakerys for coffee and goodies. So many places to eat there, very unique . Since we are from Ohio, it was very exciting for us. If we ever get back out, we will stay again."
35,2085,"Aug 31 2009 	Great stay at a great location	We stayed 5 nights in this Japanese style hotel with Japanese touches such as the green tea and shoji screens and deep tub and nifty shower. It was noisy being on the street side the first night so they moved us to an inside facing room which had a nice view of the twin peaks. We ate a nearby Sazu Ramen restaurant (wonderful maguro), loved shopping at Ichibankan, and bought snacks at Safeway. The Japantown pop festival was an unexpected bonus. The location is great for access by muni bus or walking to wharf, downtown, Golden Gate Park, and Hayes Valley. The front desk provided maps, newspapers, and cheerfully printed out our boarding passes."
36,2085,"Aug 24 2009 	Good stay beware of parking garage	Nice location in Japan town. Clean and quite area. A nice walk to the bay but wouldn't suggest doing it every day of your stay considering the hills. Nice, clean rooms. The parking garage was ok, but beware if you need to get out before 6:30 in the morning like we did to catch our flight, you have to pay a $50 fee (cash only!) to open the garage."
37,2085,"Aug 19 2009 	Very Nice and a Good Location for Little Ones	We enjoyed our 4-night stay at the Kabuki. Due to travel delays, we arrived after midnight we called to alert the desk of our late arrival and were very warmly greeted. Our upper level view King room was a quiet simply decorated, very nice, very clean and with a Japanese soaking tub. We did not hear any street noise (even car alarms) or the service elevator across the hall, the room was well insulated and shared a narrow balcony with the room next door. The room had an electric kettle, teabags instant coffee and a traditional cast iron Japanese tea pot and cups for tea. There was an afternoon sake tasting but we did not attend. The Desk Staff pointed out the convenient coupons and discounts on the Japantown parking website. My only complaint would be if two share the room the lack of a door into the bathroom area casts a light into the sleeping area, you are unable to light the wc without the dressing area light going on and waking other sleepers. The Japantown shops are right next door, you are able to enter the Peace Plaza Center from the lobby. There are lots of family friendly dining options, shopping, gift, and snack options nearby as well. We enjoyed very pleasant pre-bedtime strolls through Japantown each night. The Geary and Post Street buses are frequent and convenient. We will be making a return visit to the Kabuki on our next trip to San Francisco."
38,2085,"Aug 16 2009 	Perfect getaway for a honeymoon!	Not only was the hotel itself amazing with their great service, unique rice cracker pillow snacks, and the delicious breakfasts, it was close enough to everything my husband and I felt the need to experience in San Francisco. The staff went out of their way to see to it that we enjoyed ourselves the week that we were with them. The rate for our room was very reasonable and I plan on staying with them again the next time we visit San Francisco."
39,2085,"Aug 10 2009 	Overall not so great...	We were really excited to stay here because of its location (its in the center of Japantown), however that was pretty much the only good thing about it. We didn't really have any problems with the room except for the bathroom area. There is a small nook for the toilet and a shower room with a glass door with no lock! Needless to say, it isn't the best place to stay if you want privacy from family members, etc. when you are showering. On the first night there we had absolutely no hot water. We informed the front desk of our problem and they could offer no suggestions. They sent up an engineer who said that &quot;everyone must be taking a shower at the same time and that is why there is no hot water.&quot; And then he asked us, &quot;Oh, you like your showers hot?&quot; Well, duh! We waited an hour and tried the tub again. Still no hot water. This time the front desk offered to give us a key so that we could walk to a separate building to take a hot shower. Seriously? We paid to stay in a hotel room with a hot shower, why should we have to walk someplace else for a hot shower? Not to mention that we had paid extra to have a soaking tub, which in the end we couldn't use anyway. So in the end we all took cold showers and didn't use the tub until the next morning. Overall, the soaking tub was a waste of money and the service was sub-par. The location was the only decent thing as there is mall access in the hotel lobby. If you are looking for somewhere really close to Japantown, look into Hotel Kabuki. If that doesn't matter to you, definitely try someplace else."
40,2085,"Aug 10 2009 	Not impressed with Kabuki	I was excited to stay at the Kabuki after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and getting a great rate through hotwire, and having stayed there for 4 nights, I can say that I'm very disappointed with the overall stay. We had a corner room with a balcony, but we were on the 7th floor and saw only the building next door and the busy Geary Street. Nothing spectacular to look at and lots of street noise to listen to. When I went to put my toiletries on the counter in the bathroom, I was shocked at the filth around the sink. When I swiped my fingers across the counter, they were black!!!! I don't believe the back of the counter had been wiped, let alone cleaned, in a long time. It looked like the person who cleaned only did surface wiping and ignored all the rest. This made me worry about the rest of the room's cleanliness. We had only one robe, and no wash clothes. Housecleaning had to bring them up for us at our request apologizing that they just got out of the dryer, and the robe looked like it just came out of the dryer all wrinkly. There was one tea bag (just a regular store brand) and the floor didn't look like it had been vacuumed in a while. We complained and got a room in the adjoining building with no balcony, though the room was about the same size. That night a group in the hotel decided to party on their balcony at 3:00 in the morning and were shouting down to the courtyard which echoed into our room. It was the most obnoxious night I've had in a hotel. The front desk was responsive once we called them and the &quot;guests&quot; went back into their room, though I'm sure the neighboring room was not too happy since we were able to hear EVERYTHING next door to us. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years, and I think this hotel was one of my most disappointing stays ever, mostly because I had higher expectations from this sight."
41,2085,"Aug 7 2009 	Great Hotel in a Great Neighborhood	We booked an awesome deal for the hotel and were so pleasantly surprised to find how nice the hotel and the neighborhood of Japantown was... The room was very clean, nicely &amp; simply decorated with touch of modern Asian, the bed was comfy, internet was easy, plenty of shops &amp; eateries within walking distance. definitely recommend the cute little asian shops &amp; crepes right inside the mall next door and Fillmore St for shops like Marc Jacobs, etc! We were looking forward to going to the Kabuki Springs Spa but unlucky for us, it was undergoing a cleaning/renovation during the week of our stay... darn... Parking was the only pain, but other than that, everything was great!"
42,2085,Aug 7 2009 	Relax at Kabuki	So nice to have a nice hotel to stay in after Yosemite. Centre of Japan Town.Nasty $16 daily parking charge. Everything else was fantastic. Bit of a distance from downtown SF but a good base for travel.Staff were so nice and polite.
43,2085,"Aug 5 2009 	Great Hotel Good/Safe Location Highly Recommended for SF First Timers	This is the first time we visited San Francisco, and we're so glad to have chosen this hotel as a great introduction to the city! Japantown is not too far from the main San Francisco attractions, yet not too close to the noisy, overcrowded streets of the more popular parts of the city. It is a very safe &amp; clean place to walk around, and there are plenty of Japanese restaurants, grocery stores, and gift shops steps away from the hotel. The hotel accommodations we great - the room was very clean and looks just like the pictures from the hotel's website and the king size bed was very comfortable. On our floor it was pretty quiet - we did not hear other travelers at night, but maybe because we stayed on weekdays. We visited the main attractions using public transportation and walking. There are a couple of bus lines very close to the hotel, depending where you want to go. If you look at a map of San Francisco, you will see that Japantown is only 10-15 minutes away by bus to most major attractions. We also used our GPS to find good restaurants/shops and were delighted to find that you can get to them within a 2 mile radius. The doorman and staff were also very helpful in arranging taxi or helping you figure out which bus line to take. We would recommend first time travelers to San Francisco to get the city pass (available on SF's visitor website), which includes passes to main attractions and 7 day, unlimited pass to all the bus/muni/trolley public transportation."
44,2085,"Aug 4 2009 	A great very safe location and nice hotel	We stayed for 4 nights in an 'Executive Sauna Suite' which comprised 2 rooms and bathroom with sauna. The kids slept on the sofa-bed in the living room. The price was very good through Expedia. When we arrived we were able to park in the front of the hotel whilst checking in. If you have a car, this is a good place to stay as there is parking in an independent underground car park which has a lift up to the hotel lobby, for $16 per day. The room was comfortable, especially the king size bed, not so much the sofa-bed. There was a balcony overlooking the Peace Pagoda. The fixtures and fittings probably needed some updating, but not overly so. The lobby is lovely as is the Zen Garden. We didn't eat at the hotel - breakfast was expensive, so we went to May's Coffee Shop in Kintetsu Mall (on the opposite side of the Peace Pagoda, near Benihana). We ate on the first night at Benihana which the kids especially enjoyed. We had a great time in San Francisco and would recommend in particular the California Academy of Sciences for children and adults alike (especially the aquarium, the climate change exhibit and the green roof)."
45,2085,"Aug 3 2009 	Relaxing stay	Hotel Kabuki is conveniently located in the heart of Japantown in San Francisco, right next door to the Japan Center (filled with great Japanese restaurants, cafes and shops), close to a movie theater and not too far from Union Square (take bus nr 38 from Geary str). The hotel is on a quiet street, making it a great location to relax after a busy day of sightseeing.Recently renovated, our room was very modern yet cozy, the king-size bed very comfortable. The bathroom had a Japanese soaking tub with bath salt to enjoy it. Large flat-screen TV and free wi-fi provided entertainment.The hotel's restaurant had breakfast but instead we decided to walk a few steps and grab a bite at one of the cafes in Japan Center.Room rates are originally higher but we got a great deal on Travelzoo."
46,2085,"Aug 1 2009 	i'll be back	i loved this hotel, the staff were friendly, the room was lovely and the bed very comfortable. the japanese bath was brilliant. toiletries supplied [especially the soaps] were of excellent quality and there was an abundance of towels. i'll be back."
47,2085,"Jul 31 2009 	Ideal location for anyone visiting San Francisco.	The room we got was for $80.00 through Travel Ticker and you couldn't ask for better. Our room had two walk-out balconies on the tenth floor that had phenomenal views in either of those directions. The room looks just like it does in the picture, with lots of nice touches like the chaise longe and the print screens that allow you to let in light or the bamboo shutters that can close over the screens to completely darken the room. The lobby is lovely with it's view of a Japanese garden and many places to sit in. I used the well-equipped exercise room that also has a view into part of the garden. It was cold in San Francisco and the hotel had a fantastic A/C to crank up the heat. My teenage daughter was in paradise because the Japan Town mall is only a few hunded feet away and was full of Japanese restaurants, knock-off jewelry, bag shops, Manga and anime stores and a wonderful hair salon to get her hair cut in a Japanese style. I enjoyed walking over to this mall every morning to get my coffee along with a freshly-made Japanese pastry shaped like a fish, with a wonderful filling. Across the street from the Hotel Kabuki is a restaurant called Sanppo that we ate in a couple of times which had great atmosphere, the best tempura and seafood soba. The staff there are very friendly and thoughtful. We were within a 20 minute walk to the Union Square part of town and from there took a 20.00 double-decker tour bus that took us all over to the tourist sites and where you can get off and on as often as you please for two days, not a bad deal. In that Union Square area there's a lot of shopping, but it was like our tour bus guide said, &quot;Neiman Marcus, otherwise known as needless mark-up.&quot; The line to get into the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art went around the corner when we got there. But what we saw inside was well worth the waiting. It was a great vacation for us."
48,2085,"Jul 30 2009 	Excellent hotel in a great location	My wife and I really enjoyed staying at the Hotel Kabuki for the three nights we stayed in San Francisco. The staff was friendly, the hotel clean (really nice-looking lobby area with its Japanese ambience), and the location suited us tremendously. The Japantown mall is immediately adjacent to the hotel, and there is a convenient underground parking lot just below the hotel. The hotel is also close to the Upper Fillmore area with its many restaurants, shops, and casual eating areas - a great area to simply wander before or after dinner."
49,2085,"Jul 28 2009 	Love this place	Sometimes you can get a great rate, in part because it's not in the center of the usual business/tourist action around Embaradero, Union Square and the wharf. On the other hand, it's closer than the expensive hotels to the SF zoo and Golden Gate Park and the Haight. The rooms are very nice, the underground parking is $2/hr and $16 for 24 hours (but no in/out, not that it mattered to us, and valet is $40). If you don't have a car, it's about a $7 cab ride down to the BART. Restaurant's a bit overpriced ($3 coffee to go), but with the room deal, it's a small price to pay. Nice spa around the corner. Beds very comfortable, accommodating front desk, attentive management. My second stay, and I'll go back. The one thing that was a nuisance was the fitness center, which had only one treadmill and one bike -- it renders the morning schedule uncertain if you have to wait for a machine."
50,2085,Jul 26 2009 	Clean. Lovely. Quiet.	Found a great last minute deal featured on msnbc.com. Great location for us. The peace and quiet was a pleasant surprise as it is just off of the beaten path. Staff was very friendly. This hotel was a pleasure to have as home base. Only complaint is everything closes at 8pm in Japantown. (This very well may be the reason for such peace and quiet). You'll have to grab some provisions on Sutter or Geary before calling it a night unless you want a $5 snickers or a $7 water from the minibar.
51,2085,Jul 26 2009 	Loved It	In town for King Tut Exhibit. Hotel Kabuki was a grreat experience. Check-in very easy. Room is quite large and bathroom was fantastic. Loved soaking tub. Instead of fluffy plain 'ole white robe you get a traditional Japanese Kimono!! Traditional tea service was not automatic. You had to ask for it - they were more than willing. Breakfast was a little steep - $18. Waitress was not very good but all other service was excellent. Doorman very helpful; front desk very helpful. Plenty of underground parking. $16/night. Hotel does not validate. Would definitely go back.
52,2085,"Jul 20 2009 	It was fine but would try another location next time; people polite	We took the San Francisco City Shuttle to our hotel since it was just about to leave and costs $17.00 and brought us directly to Hotel Kabuki. The shuttle back was $13, so it might have been some sort of airport fee attached the first time. We were given room 1007 by a very friendly Daniel at the front desk. We were not given any information about the city at all, just when the gym was open. Our room was a corner room with a small balcony. It was very nice, the view was nice. The room was a decent size, but the bathroom was configured oddly, but maybe thats how its done in Japan. There was one sink, full wall mirror, closeted toilet and a combination area with the deep soak tub and a shower alongside. The shower had just enough of pressure to make it ok. This area had a glass door and as such, no one else could use the sink area if you are taking a shower. I never used the deep soak tub on the trip. The clear door which was inches away from the wall mirror would have been better suited to a romantic room. Our balcony door had the pretty shutters which certainly led to having lots of natural light. We never did get the tea service that is advertised on the website, though there was a tea service in the room already. Not a deal breaker, but a bit of a downer. We also found that it was very easy to walk the city from Hotel Kabuki, but we are walkers, so everyone might not think so. We never did take public transportation anywhere, though one did take a cab back twice. All employees we encountered very nice and polite and I loved our doorman. He was exceptionally pleasant and helpful. But one did have to sort of force the front desk for help; there was always a smile, but, I think at times, it should have been provided not have to ask. The answers were always a little tnetative regarding the garage, so if you ahve a car, you may want to get definite conclusive answers. There is also a place by the lounge that you can pick up coffee for $3.00 in the morning, since there isn't alot of places in the immediate area.I really did not get a chance to explore the hotel itself, but the decor was very classic, neutral and calming. Also, this is a good hotel if you are seeing a show at The Fillmore as it is literally 3 blocks away."
53,2085,"Jul 18 2009 	Nice place to stay	Stayed here for 2 days while in town. Booked the room for about 80USD avg per night through travel ticker deal. This hotel is good value for money. Check in was easy and hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The room was clean and tidy, the hot tub was really nice. Its a little distance from the attractions. But a taxi ride will only cost you 7USD to get from here to chinatown area. If you need a shuttle to get to the airport, call the shuttle directly. The concierge charge another 6 dollars to help you arrange for the shuttle. A good place to stay."
54,2085,"Jul 18 2009	Nice hotel location not great!	The hotel was clean and well furnished with good size rooms and friendly staff. The hotel is situated in Japan town which is a little outside the centre of the city. This may cause a problem if you are only there for a short time. The area appears to be safe and there are a local shops and supermarkets within easy reach.As San Francisco is very hilly, unless you are super fit you may find it a problem to walk form the hotel to fishermans wharf etc. We did it once and then got taxis for the rest of the time.Overall no complaints with the hotel apart from the location"
55,2085,"Jul 17 2009 	Hotel Kabuki pretty unpleasant.	The lobby was full of circling flies.Our hotel room was bizarrely constructed, so the toilet was in a TINY little alcove, and then the shower was in another room entirely. There was no fan, so the shower steam just settled on everything. As a result, the room got musty and stayed that way for the entire trip.The 'exercise room' is hardly that, with equipment from 1970 that hardly works. I think it used to be a conference room.Parking is a nightmare. If you have a car, stay somewhere else!The only semi-good things about this hotel are its proximity to Japan Town (it's IN it), the breakfast buffet (though it's expensive), and the beds. Otherwise, there's really nothing good to say about this hotel."
56,2085,"Jul 17 2009 	One word: BEDBUGS	That says it all. Management claimed the room had been treated but the headboard was not removed, and the bugs lived there. I had over 200 bites."
57,2085,"Jul 12 2009 	Meh	Average service. Rooms had interesting decor. Hotel bar ok. Would stay again if the price was right. Parking was expensive and difficult to find. Wasn't fantastic, but not bad either. Price rather expensive."
58,2085,"Jul 11 2009 	Nice Hotel and Location	We really liked the Hotel Kabuki. We got a great rate and it was a great value. Parking was a concern for me in SF,but you could park next door in a covered lot with a direct elevator to the hotel for only $16 per night. We spent a full day sightseeing using the bus system and a cable car ride and there was a bus stop only a few hundred feet from the front door of the hotel. It was very convenient and we didn't have to worry about parking at the popular tourist spots. I liked the separated bathroom with the toilet, sink, and shower all in there own little rooms. Also, I walked three blocks down to the drugstore at 8PM and had no concerns about the neighborhood."
59,2085,"Jul 8 2009 	Loved our stay here!	Our room was very clean! The beds were really comfy in my opinion with goose down pillows and the sheets were changed every day! Our room was on the 16th floor, which I really LOVED! The view was awesome at night and during the day. The flat screen TV was a nice bonus, too! The bathroom was very clean as well. The hotel was awesome in regards to keeping the noise level down. It felt like we were the only ones there. So quiet and peaceful; the Japanese style sliding doors that covered the glass doors that led to the balcony allowed for virtually no light to peak through so it was very dark at night and kept noise out of the room from outside. The neighborhood seemed very safe. Overall, we really liked this hotel. My two kids and husband enjoyed it just as much as me! I would definitely recommend this hotel again. Just don't pay their $35 a night parking for valet. There is a parking garage adjacent to the hotel for $16 a day, but you have to pay to go in and out. Just park along the street during the day and pay $16 overnight."
60,2085,"Jul 7 2009 	Nice Location; Convenient; Some nice rooms but a little worn...	A relatively large hotel in a nice neighborhood in Japantown, conveniently connected to the Japantown plaza shopping mall, where there are plenty of good places to eat (Japanese &amp; Asian food, of course) and shop (excellent Japanese bookstore and other shops). The basic rooms, especially the double, are tight. Ours lacked any kind of dresser, which meant we lived out of our suitcases for 5 days; not the most comfortable situation. The Japanese baths (separate shower and deep soaking tub) are a nice touch, but it takes up a lot of room that would otherwise allow for more living space. The rooms in the low-rise section (junior suites, etc.) are much better, though the views are better in the tower. Parking at the shopping plaza is relatively cheap ($15/day) and convenient (direct access to the elevator, straight to your room). No in/out access, though. The finishes are worn, corners of furniture a bit beaten up, but the place is clean and service is fine (though not great). I'd stay there again, but would opt for a larger room."
61,2085,"Jul 5 2009 	This place is fine for a single traveler	The hotel's appearance, from the outside,is fine. However, once in the room, it was on the small side with an oddly-configurated bathroom. The toilet room, single sink &quot;cove&quot; with little counter (for a double room), and combination Japanese tub and shower were cramped and all operated by a single light switch. One in our party had to rise early to attend a conference and, needless to say, the single light mechanism bothered the others who were trying to sleep. Did I mention there was no door separating the bath area from the double bed area? I don't know if the other rooms were similarly designed (we were on the top floor) but having no privacy on this trip was a problem. Plus, no hot tub, pool or sauna. The fitness areas was poor. Few places to sit in public places. Uncomfortable seating in the lobby. Not a good value for the cost. The view was nice."
62,2085,"Jun 24 2009 	THE place to stay in SF	We did a lot of research before deciding to spend our 4nights in SF at Hotel Kabuki. In retrospect, this was a great choice!Value - great value with respect to other comparable hotels we had considered. This is a legitimate 3.5 hotel in my opinion, in a great part of the city. We got a great internet rate of $90/night for deluxe-view room, which was lower than any comparable hotels in Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square area, or Embarcadero. Plus, this hotel comes with free internet and in-room fridge; self-parking is only $15/day. Most Union Sqr and Wharf hotels charge $30-$50 parking per day. To boot, they upgraded us to Corner View Room for free!Room - our Corner View Room was on the 10th floor, and it was great. Very spacious room, nice comfy bed, nice bed linens, thick bath towels, clean carpet. As others have commented, the bathroom was magnificent. Separate shower and deep sunken tub next to each other. The tub is just great to soak in. The bath salt that they provide, though, is not that great. You can actually get the real Japanese hot spring bath salts (sold in packaged box) at the nearby store in Miyako Mall called Ichiban-Kan. Those are much better. The room does show some wear and tear in certain spots, but is overall well-kept. The biggest problem was that the free wireless internet had extremely spotty connection.Location - we were under the impression that Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf area might be the best locations in the city. But in hindsight Hotel Kabuki's location worked out the best. The Union Square area has a lot of brand-name stores and is convenient to the BART and to Chinatown, etc. But we were not in SF to check out brand-name stores, and there's a lot of homeless presence in that area. Fisherman's Wharf area is just too hectic and touristy. On the other hand, Hotel Kabuki is connected to Japantown malls which have loads of great Japanese shops and restaurants (recommend Sophie's Crepes for great crepes and gelatos, and Benihana or Mifune for lunch). You can enter the eastern end of Japantown mall directly from the hotel lobby and then walk across the malls out the western end and you'll be right in Fillmore District that has loads of cafes, eateries and shops lining Fillmore St... this is one of the coolest hangout streets in SF. 20minute walk north from the hotel will get you to Union St, another street filled with shops and cafes.Service - the free room upgrade was a major plus. On the down-side, there were many basic things that we had a hard time getting them to supply us with. Like the shampoo... they never gave us new shampoos, even after we ran out on the third night. Another time we needed plates but the front desk told us it'd be a while before we could get them because both the restaurant and the room-service were closed that day and every housekeeping staff was busy. Ended up taking over 30minutes to get a plate and nearly as long to get the extra shampoo. I don't know if the place is short-handed or what. Housekeeping's pretty good overall, but a little bit quirky... like not supplying new shampoos at all and one day giving us less number of towels. But all in all, these were not major issues."
63,2085,"Jun 23 2009 	Nice Place to Stay in Japantown	Stayed here for a week while my daughter was at UCSF. The location was fine since we wanted a place not too far from the hospital. We were in a view room with 2 doubles on the 11th floor. The room was quiet, couldn't even hear the ipod playing loudly next door until I went into the hallway. Everything was clean and the bathroom was spacious. Liked the separate shower and tub, and plenty of hot water. The beds were comfortable, although 2 Queen size would have been better. My daughter enjoyed the free wireless internet so she could &quot;stay connected&quot; while on our trip. I did think it was strange though that there was a shared balcony with the room next door. Would think that might be a security risk.One complaint I have is with the parking. Almost $40/night to have &quot;valet&quot; parking service, which means they park your car in their parking lot right by the front door. Or you can park it yourself in their lot and still pay the $40. On the last night when the lot was full we found out about the alternate underground parking garage which was only $15 for overnight and we could take the elevator from the garage straight up to the 11th floor! A much better bargain and just as convenient."
64,2085,"Jun 22 2009 	Comfortable and welcoming	We stayed at this hotel during our visit as our first time in San Fran. It was a very good thing we made it as our first hotel of our 6 day trip, as we had day trips planned elsewhere. We did stay here for 2 nights.We loved everything about Hotel Kabuki, regardless of the fact that our bed, which of course happened to be Sleep Number bed. We booked with one of the King Kabuki Rooms, and we don't regret it one bit! Our bed had one small problem on the right side, it didn't even work properly when using the controller. Another problem we had was we were unable to soak in the &quot;deep tub&quot; everyone has been raving about. (wish it worked for us, though) It would of been nice, since we did walked all day and put many miles walking down those steep hills! When it got time for bath, the knob on the faucet came loose and fell out! Whoops. We were unable to get it to work at this point and did not want to be bother from the staff about this minor issue. So there goes our bath! However the shower head was amazing and that did it for the time being. The rooms were bright and cleaned everyday. Breakfast was offered at the end of the lounge areas, and was awesome to see each morning!If you're wondering about the staff there, everyone is very pleasant. They all treat you as guest, and willing to accomodate any request you have. Even going as far as flagging a cab car for you. (we haven't done this too much, as we come from the midwest!) They are all wonderful people at this hotel. Really, you couldn't wished for any more patient people to be in this hotel than the people who are in it serving you.We did not eat in the dinning area here because it seems kind of spendy, but what do you expect, it's a restaurant inside the hotel. Otherwise there are many other food choices along the street. Lots of cheap and very good sushi in that area.You won't regret your stay here. All the staff will amaze you. A quick cab ride to Union Square will cost you about $7. From there you can walk to many sights, and sees!"
65,2085,"Jun 21 2009 	Neat Hotel - Worth a visit	We stayed 2 nights at the hotel. The room was nice, it was on the 6th floor and we would have preferred a higher level floor because our view was directly into someone's apartment whenever we went onto the small balcony. I thought the value was great for the price and would definately stay at Kabuki in the future. Our flight left at 5 a.m. and we had a rental car, we parked the car on the street in front of the hotel the night before we left because the gararge closed sometime after midnight and doesn't open until 6 a.m. The meters are free after 6 p.m. The staff at the hotel was professional and not rude in any way. When we arrived in the room, the heat was not working, we called and someone came to repair the system immediatley. I am a black female and did not feel as though I was treated unfairly at any time. I can't say what would have happen if we had asked for a different room. Since we had spent 3 days in wine country and had a great time not very much mattered. We used the bus system while at the hotel even though we had a car in the garage. The staff was very knowledgeable and always gave us great directions along with a map and/or the bus numbers to our destination."
66,2085,"Jun 9 2009	Quiet Elegance	This is my 2nd stay at Hotel Kabuki. Tower rooms are beautifully decorated, beds extremely comfy and I always enjoy the Japanese-style soaking tubs. Staff is always helpful and courteous. This is the place to be to relax after a long day of sightseeing or business, away from the hustle/bustle of the Financial District. Located in Japantown, many awesome restaurants nearby."
67,2085,Jun 7 2009 	Kabuki is excellent	I love the Kabuki. It's Japantown location is wonderfully tranquil and allows for plenty of low-key walking-distance eating and activities. It is beginning to recapture the feel of its glory days (when it was the Miyako Hotel).
68,2085,"May 17 2009 	A Relaxing Stay	My husband and I stayed here for five night for Anniversary in April and could not have been happier! We stayed in a corner king room with a wrap around balcony and great views of the city. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom large and the deep tub was perfect after long days of walking.We never heard the traffic from outside or from our neighbors. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations for places to eat in any price range. The breakfast at the hotel was high but good. The free wi-fi was fast and never crashed. I used it often. The tea service was prompt and fun. The room service was prompt and the burger great. The prices were high, but what room service isn't? The Kabuki is centrally located in SF and it doesn't take more than 10 min to get to any part of the city. While Japan town is small what you do get is a friendly neighborhood and you can see a slice of everyday life with good food away from the bustling tourist hordes and easy access to public transportation which we took.The hotel courtyard was a Japanese Garden and was connected to the mall. While the portion of the mall the hotel is connected to is small if you cross the courtyard with the pagoda the rest of the mall is large with many interesting shops. We will definitely be back!!"
69,2085,"May 17 2009 	Great Location Cozy Hotel Nice Price!	My husband and I loved our recent stay at the Hotel Kabuki. The neighborhood was perfect; I was initially afraid that it would be too quiet, but it was lovely. Japantown was interesting, and the excellent shopping and restaurants on Fillmore were a short walk away. While some of the shared spaces in Hotel Kabuki are starting to show their age (elevators &amp; hallways,) our room (a deluxe corner king) was very clean, bright, spacious, and inviting. The bed was amazingly comfortable. And the soaking tub... ah! Fabulous! We had no problems whatsoever with the service and will gladly be staying here on future trips to San Francisco. Great rate through Travelzoo."
70,2085,"May 12 2009 	nice hotel for the price safe location	MY boyfriend is from Texas and had been wanting to go to San Francisco for a while, so I was watching travelzoo for good prices on hotels in San Francisco. The Hotel Kabuki came up for $75/night, so I checked out reviews on tripadvisor and decided to go for it. The price seriously can't be beat in the city. We were able to park in the valet lot in front of the hotel to check in and decided not to pay the extra money for valet parking. I had read that the downstairs parking does not have in and out priveleges and that the lot closes from like 2:30-5am or something. I must say that during checkin, I did see a sign clearly posted on the counter that noted the $50 fee for checking out during those hours if using the self parking. We had to drive about half a block to get to the parking lot, however it stretched underground from Benihana to the hotel elevators, so I did not find it necessary to unpack in the valet parking because we parked right by the hotel elevator. The neighborhood seemed clean and safe, and I did not experience the issue with noise that I had read about from other people. The city can be a noisy place, I don't think it's anything the hotel could have helped in those situations. I had signed up for the loyalty club before our visit and they gave us a view upgrade which was the 13th floor. The balcony is narrow, but perfect for viewing the city. I loved the soaking tub, and we went to Lush in union square and got some bath goodies for it. I noticed that a few people had mentioned rude staff in their reviews, but we had not one bad thing to say about the staff. They seemed friendly and helpful. In fact, one of the girls at the desk spent about 10 minutes with us discussing the different types of public transportation, how much they cost and how to get there. We will definitely be going back!"
71,2085,"May 11 2009 	Could have been more friendly would have been ok	My boyfriend and I found the staff at the kubuki to be rude. From the moment we came in to each time we had to go in and out. We had called to make our reservation earlier to find out if it would be ok to bring our large very mellow dog. Of course the lady we spoke to said it would be no problem as long as our dog was behaved. We even called back just before heading to the city to confirm everything was fine. Of course, the person on the phone said no problem. When we arrived they acted as if we were trying to pull something over on them and made us feel completely unwelcome. After we finally got checked in with much grumbling and whispering behind the counter, we wanted to quickly unload the car before taking the car to the garage. Because we didn't want valet parking they wouldn't let us use the cart to move our luggage until we begged.The room was ok. Obviously covering up a crappier room that once existed. The advertised balcony only had enough room for one person to stand and no one to pass behind them.The best part and saving grace of the place for the bathroom. It rocked. Deep tub and shower room and nice vanity area.Bed was really comfortable and the room was large.We purchased a food package to eat at the restaurant with our room. Food was excellent, if a little over priced. They didn't credit our bill at first at check out and we had to go back and asked for it to be re-done. Same deal with the luggage cart, except this time my boyfriend let the guy know what he thought about that..."
72,2085,"May 10 2009 	great value great neighborhood	got a great price online. rooms are large, comfortable, nice sheets, rooms a little worn, but nice soaking tub in room. very good, understated service. i love the neighborhood-japan town bordering on pacific heights-peaceful streets, some of san francisco's best restaurants within a 1 block radius (Kiss Seafood and Quince), Fillmore Street just a few blocks away for breakfast, shopping, restaurants. As cabs are hard to find in SF, this place is great as it puts you at the foot of one of SF's bes,t non-touristy neighborhoods (i used to live in the neighborhood here so it is especially welcome to me)."
73,2085,"May 10 2009 	Okay	I'd read a review here that an African American woman traveling alone posted a few months ago. I've had similar experiences, but I didn't want to let her negative experience influence me. Sure enough, we were initially given a crappy room. But I must say that after the room was changed( that took some doing), our stay was okay. The location is great. lots of great restaurants in the area ( try 1300 on Fillmore). Just a six dollar cab ride to downtown. The club rooms are spacious. Although they do need some upgrades. The continental breakfast was just enough to hold us over 'til lunch. Overall it was what I expected for about a hundred bucks a night in San Francisco."
74,2085,"Apr 27 2009 	Beware!	The actual hotel is okay. It's average, but beware. My flight left at 6AM, so I had to leave the hotel around 4AM. When I tried to leave and to go the airport, the self parking garage they told me to park in was closed. They said if I want to get my car I needed to pay my regular parking fee PLUS AN EXTRA $50. I knew nothing about this but then the guy at the front desk pointed out a little piece of paper they had it written on. So, they extorted $50 out of me and wouldn't even let me put it on a credit card. They made me pay the security guard $50 cash to open the garage gate."
75,2085,"Apr 23 2009 	Wonderful with extras	They got it right when doing this hotel. It has wonderful little extras, from a soaking tub in your bathroom, to a tea pot in the room to a balcony with views. The front door staff and front desk staff are friendly and helpful. In the spotless room is a safe, a large closet, walk in bathroom, seperate toilet. Two showers even, and mine was a standard room.There is a Japanese garden with a pond. Quite business center. The room had 2 beds and were very comfortable. They provide the bath salts, more if you want them. Soaked after a long day, and felt ready to go out for the nightlife. Across the street are a lot of choices for eating. 50yrds from 3 buslines. Parking $15 garage connected to the hotel.We paid $84, which was a great deal."
76,2085,"Apr 21 2009 	Tub good noise bad	I'm sitting in my room as I write this. The room is great, the tub is great, the bed is great. Unlimited HOT water. My neighbor must have croup or emphysema or something and he apparently likes to close out the bar. The street noise is horrible. Sirens, banging, people without mufflers, motorcycles racing - till about midnight every night. So I'm here for an educational seminar and not getting sleep is ruining the experience. If you are a heavy sleeper - go for it! Maybe if I were on a floor higher up I would be o.k.."
77,2085,"Apr 20 2009 	A nice place to stay...	My hubby and I stayed at the Kabuki as we wanted to reconnect with Japantown, a place with fond memories of long ago. It did not disappoint. We were very happy with our overall stay. We came in early and they were able to let us into our room, a corner king with a wonderful view. The room was wonderful. Very spacious, great bed and great tub and bathing area. Nice oriental decor, but not too overwheleming. We brought our kids in the next day and the staff was very accommodating (they were great all around) and even provided us with a crib. The room was spacious enough for the two kids (both under 4) and they loved the bath! Being at Japantown was nice because there was so much to see and do. We were even able to visit the Fillmore which was just blocks away. One thing that would have been nice was a coffee maker in the room. Without that an a nearby coffee shop, we resorted to room service which isn't always cheap, but the coffee was good. Also, there's no &quot;welcome tea service&quot; as mentioned on the their (JDV) website. There is a kettle and a tea pot in the room, but there was nothing Asian about the tea selection - orange and cranberry (?). Also, the hotel gives you a spa-like feel with the nice bath and the nearby spa, but don't expect spa-like amenities like good bath products or luxurious towels, although the robes were very nice.Internet access worked fine in the room and parking was convenient in the Japantown center garage ($15/day).Overall, it really was a nice place to stay and we'd definitely go back again."
78,2085,"Apr 13 2009 	Spacious rooms	I had stayed here once before when it was the Radisson Miyako and while the name has changed to Kabuki, not much has changed.The king bed room was very spacious and had a balcony that was shared with the room next door. It's mainly a balcony for the view as you only have standing room, but the view sure was nice. The room felt a bit old and new at the same time.The bed was awesome. The work desk and chair are great for those of us who have to spend most of our time working in a hotel room. The room feels nice enough and it's spacious, that staying there is fine and the minibar is stack full of tasy bags of chips, candy etc, good stuff. There is a small desk and a couch as well. The room also a has a small closet space for clothes and a safe, but it has very little vertical space to hang your pants and shirts which was a bit annoying.The bathroom is split into a toilet and then the awesome japanese bath. The bath itself is huge and there's all kinds of different bath salts to try out. It certainly is a great place to relax and the best part of the Kabuki experience. The toiletries are nice and the whole bathroom feels nice and homely and not so state of the art and fashionable that it gets uncomfortable. There's enough space for your own toiletries etc as well.The bar in the lobby is the usual hotel bar. The breakfast room was basic and the food was mostly comprised of the usual american breakfast, which was allright, but nothing special.The location is awesome if you want to be in Japantown right next to some great restaurants and Fillmore isn't that far, but for a downtown San Francisco experience, it's quite a walk down to Union Square (about 18-20 minutes), but cabs are cheap. Still, the location feels nicer than downtown with no homeless people roaming around, but if you want to step out of the hotel and get your Starbucks/fast food/shopping fix, this is too far."
79,2085,"Apr 12 2009 	Great hotel great location... awesome rooms!	We received a room upgrade and we ended up in a king corner room with soaking tub... gorgeous, The room was so spacious and the views out of the window were nice although do not chose your room because of the balcony or the views (both are something you can live without)The bathroom and bath tub were Excellent and they provided all that was needed for a great bathing experience. The check in complimentary tea was a nice touch.The wifi access is patchy to say the least, when I asked the concierge they said it was the provider and they could do nothing about it but well it does the trick for some quick internet checks.The Kabuki springs and Spa (for which you have access when you book through their website) is nice and the massages are so good but the place is quite openly gay so... be prepared to see some funny things going on... this is SF!!The room was not cleaned one day and when we came back and asked for the reason we were told it was probably because the do not disturb sign was on the door (not the case). The maids leave before 6 so... we had to do the room ourselves although they brought fresh towels and all the rest.The concierge and the rest of the staff were great providing directions, change, services, etc.The O Izakaya restaurant serves delicious food.The hotel is nicely connectec to Union Sq by buses number 2, 3 and 4 (I think) and also with the 38 coming back from Union Sq. Bus 22 goes down to the Castro and the stop is 2 blocks away.All in all the place was much more than we thought it would be and it is something we totally recommend"
80,2085,"Apr 6 2009 	I wanted to like it but..	I choose this hotel because the location is great, near Fillmore and not too far from Haight. I know it would be noisy but I am used to that so it didn't bother me. I was given a big king room which was very comfortable but my first two nights were ruined by the horrifically inconsiderate couple who screamed and swore at each other whilst their little kids cried. I managed to at least be given a new room to sleep in and thankfully the couple left to whatever horrible life they had created for themselves eleswhere. It would have been nice if the hotel had cleaned the dirty diapers that they left outside their room for the time they spent there. The rest of the stay was ok except the TV reception stopped working and I was given a half hearted &quot;nothing we can do sir it's the win' response. I gave up trying to get it fixed. The internet service was really patchy perhaps because the band width is not enough for all the people staying in the hotel. Frustrating when you are trying to use it for business. One day it stopped working altogether The restaurant is now closed Monday and Tuesday which is a pain but there are plenty of restaurants in the area. It is also not open for lunch. However when I ate there I thought the food was very good and the staff were very pleasant. The other staff at the hotel were a mixed bag of very helpful and surly and useless. I think they need to work on this very quickly. All in all an average hotel which was needs to sharpen up it's service. I am not sure I would stay there again as I was frustrated by the TV and internet which mayt be very petty but staying at a place for two weeks on business it is good to be able to relax in your room and just watch some TV some nights."
81,2085,"Apr 6 2009 	A Native San Franciscan gives thumbs Up!	My husband and I live now in SO.Cal and we took our two young children, a 3 yr old and 10 month old up to SF. Knowing SF the way I do, I like to stay centrally located, where we're close to great restaurants, neighborhoods, shopping, museums and parks. I prefer not to stay where it's touristy. The location of this hotel is perfect because it gives you direct access to beautiful neighborhoods where the best restaurants are always hidden, and you're just a quick cab ride to the theatre district and downtown. When you arrive at the hotel the staff is extremely hospitable, the check in is quick and easy. The rooms are clean, neat and not cluttered. We stayed in a suite and my kids were able to play; my older son had room to do his puzzles, play and read. My baby could crawl around and not get hurt. It was perfect. The bed was literally one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I give this hotel a 5 star rating! We will most definitely be returning again."
82,2085,"Apr 6 2009 	You had me at soaking tub.	My husband and I spent 4 days in San Francisco, just to get away. When I heard about the traditional Japanese baths, I was sold. Hotel Kabuki did not disappoint. The room was lovely, sumptuous linens, beautiful views of the city, and that tub! I'm still pining over it. The doorman helped us arrange a rental car for our day trip to Muir Woods, the front desk was courteous, and the cleaning crew kept our room in tip-top shape.We had snacks and cocktails at O Izakaya Lounge which were very yummy. The prices were consistent with a hotel restaurant, but the menu had some nice variety. We found some tasty (and more affordable) food in the nearby Japan Center. There's hardly a shortage of great food in San Francisco so go, explore, eat!"
83,2085,"Mar 26 2009 	Some good some bad ...	My college-aged daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Kabuki from Friday, March 13th through Tuesday, March 17th. There were some very good things but some not so good things about this hotel. Good things first: we arrived into SFO early and were allowed to check in prior to noon. Very nice. The room was lovely - plenty of room, two very comfortable beds, nice amenities including comfy robes (nice touch!). Bads: extremely loud street noise!! The location is perfect, but we were right on the corner overlooking Geary and all day and all night we could hear the street traffic. The wireless internet, while free (good), was terribly slow, when we could even get a connection (extremely frustrating for a college kid who is addicted to Facebook and wanted to post daily updates). Also, for staying at the hotel for four nights, it was odd that there was not a dresser in the room. There was no place to unpack our suitcases. We had a $10 credit each day for the restaurant. We used it one day for continential breakfast - the danish were probably a day too old but the fresh fruit was great. The mini bar (nice touch) had two bags of chips that were past their freshness date. All in all, it was a very nice place to stay, just alittle more attention to detail and maybe some sort of noise cancelling option for the street noise (a white noise machine, maybe). Thanks, though, the staff couldn't be more gracious and we did have a lovely time."
84,2085,"Mar 25 2009 	Not quite like the Miyako but still good...	Hotel Kabuki, formerly the Miyako Hotel, has reinvented itself as part of the JDV hotel group. While not quite what it used to be if you are looking for old school japanese style (like the Japanese breakfasts you could get at the restaurant), it remains a good place, especially if you like the quiet and pedestrian friendly environs of Japantown"
85,2085,"Mar 25 2009 	Wonderful San Francisco hotel.	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Kabuki with our two sons (in their early twenties) in an adjacent room. The rooms were clean, attractive and comfortable, and joined only by an external balcony - a perfect arrangement for us. The hotel's decor is definitely Japanese, but not overdone, and my wife found the room's soaking tub just the thing after a day of walking up and down San Francisco's hills. The view from our room was excellent."
86,2085,"Mar 18 2009 	Great hotel great location very cool!	We got a great deal on this hotel so we decided to try it out. It was a good size room for the price we paid (under $100) especially for San Francisco. It is in the heart of Japantown, which was amazing and most things were in walking distance (Fishermans warf was about 3 miles, which was the furthest thing we saw).The beds were super comfortable...white, soft bedding with 4 pillows on each bed. The bath soaps and shampoos were high quality, and the rooms were very clean. There were 2 robes in our room that matched the Japanese decor.We didn't try the breakfast but it was available. The room service was based on Japanese cuisine but they also had some American food. The bathroom of the hotel was my favorite part, because it was so unique. It is a little strange, but really clean and nice (it had a traditional Japanese soaking tub in a steam room).As far as parking goes, from what i've seen its very reasonable if you self park at the Japantown mall garage. It has a special entrance elevator that takes you directly to your floor or to the lobby. Its $15 per day versus $35 valet per day.Its great to be able to stay in the middle of San Francisco and not have to hear all the noise of the streets too. Free Wi-Fi too!!! We all slept very well and we will definitely come back."
87,2085,Mar 12 2009 	Good value	I loved the asian design but it was expected for staying in Japantown. The room was comfortable and clean. Not quite as spacious as I expected but certainly on par with other hotels. We did have a corner until with a balcony (hehe) which was about a foot and a half deep but did allow me to walk around and look out over the city. The location of the hotel was great...it's actually connected to the mall which is a giant food court. Please note that everything opens at 11ish and closes pretty early. This includes the hotel's restaurant and room service. The bedding was comfortable but I thought the TV was oddly placed across the room on the desk which cut a good amount of work space out.The bathroom was nice with a large tub and a separate shower enclosed in one area. I was a bit uncomfortable that the door to the toilet had wooden louvers and the bathroom door was shoji....not much privacy if you intend to have guest sitting right outside the door watching tv.The front desk personnel were ok but when I asked for a place for late night eating...I was referred to the bellman instead. He was exceptionally helpful.Taxi costs from the hotel to the Ferry building then from Chinatown back is about $9 each way. oh yeah...parking is outrageous $35 a night so don't bring a vehicle if you don't have to.
88,2085,Mar 6 2009 	Nice Rooms and Atmosphere Great Location	Enjoyed the authentic Japanese Bath in the room and proximity to city centre. Free wifi that actually worked :)
89,2085,"Mar 3 2009 	Liked the atmosphere and immediate neighborhood	A see-saw experience. First room I was given was tiny, next to a service elevator, and across from the housekeepers' supply closet. Noise began early. Elevator cables whining and grinding, etc. Spoke with manager and was offered choice of two other rooms. Moved to a much nicer room for same price. After moving to new room asked doorman for a taxi. He pointed me to a black car - - no taxi light on top. I climbed in and looked for a meter. Driver said price was $20 to my destination. I said that as tourist I had no way to know if that was reasonable; price went down to $15. I got out. Driver and doorman became quite unpleasant. I went to desk and spoke to manager who showed me the taxi stand nearby. Fare was $8. Quite the town car tourist trap. Target on my back?The night doorman on duty when I had to get the airport shuttle at 6 AM was very pleasant and helpful.Local Japanese malls and shops are interesting and some very good restaurants. Free internet in room. Nice tea service. Note: as an older black woman traveling alone, I have had decades of having to request a better room after first being given the worst in the house; it has almost become a routine. Wish some hotels would surprise me."
90,2085,"Mar 2 2009 	Enjoyable neighborhood and comfortable hotel	We stayed at the Kabuki February 2009 for 5 days. We found the people friendly and helpful and the location great for us, as we love Japanese food, sampling the local restaurants and exploring the local markets. It's located next to the Japan Centre, full of great shops and restaurants in several buildings. We got a nice Internet Special deal, which made the price within a reasonable range. The Filmore district, with tons of jazz clubs, is only a few blocks away, and there is a bus that goes to Union Sq nearby. The Filmore farmers market (walk past the Japan Centre, make a left on Filmore and walk 2 or 3 blocks) is in a lovely outdoor venue on Saturdays with an excellent jazz band playing, a great place to spend a few hours on a pretty Saturday. (Great produce vendors where you can pick up some fruit--Don't miss the Afghani food vendor--you will want to have some of their stuffed bread and sauces for lunch). There is a Starbucks there as well...2 snags on the room: Wireless is an extra charge, and no simple breakfast options for early risers: The hotel's buffet is expensive--even what they call &quot;continental&quot; breakfast, and there is no provision for just getting coffee and a roll or something. The Japan Centre eateries don't open before 10:30, even the deli and crepe place. There is an electric kettle and cups, and a japanese teapot and cups in the room, but no coffee maker and no tea supplies--we had to buy some at the market ourselves. One day we had toast and coffee sent up to the room, and Saturday we ate pastries at the Farmer's Market &amp; got coffee at Starbucks there. We did find a kind of dodgy place a couple of blocks away finally, and had breakfast there--the only customers in the place. That cup of coffee or tea in the morning is important to us!If a visitor wants to see all the major sights, etc., maybe there are more convenient places; we are an older couple with children in the area who take us to events and the parks, though, so we really loved the neighborhood."
91,2085,"Feb 28 2009 	a fantastic experience	When we arrived tired after a 15 hour journey from Scotland the staff from the doormen to the receptionists made us so welcome. They upgrade us to a queen size deluxe room with corner balcony with amazing views over San Francisco.The location is perfect for both Japan town and Fillmore street, which is a superb place for eating and drinking.We headed for Peru and were coming back to the hotel after 12 days and the hotel was more than happy to keep luggage for us.The only downside I would say is the cost of the breakfast but there is a fantastic wee place in the Japan centre that does a great brekkie.all in all a most enjoyable stay and we would go back there in a minute."
92,2085,"Feb 28 2009 	Awesome beds and rooms!	Self-park at the Japantown Parking Garage, just down the hill from H. Kabuki and save $20 on parking. The soaking tub and welcoming tea service were high-end amenities at affordable SF rates! Our new favorite place."
93,2085,"Feb 11 2009 	Jewel in JTown for foodies	I stayed 3 nights in mid January at the Kabuki, a very reasonably priced convenient launch pad to local Japanese restaurants and meeting point with old friends. My room was in Garden wing; did not eat at the hotel breakfast buffet; there are many great joints on Fillmore, 5 minutes away (including a terrific crepe restaurant). Room is &quot;somewhat&quot; renovated, very decent size. Was looking forward to using the Japanese bath at the Kabuki Spa nearby, but unfortunately, were told water temperature was not high enough to open. The great attraction of the Kabuki for me is that it is adjacent to the JTown Center, where there is a very large number of small Japanese restaurants of all stripes: this s a bit of heaven! JTown itself is a bit uneven but the hotel is a short 5 minute walk to the middle of Pacific Heights. There are also convenient Japanese grocery stores very close by. The Kabuki (in terms of location, quality) is comparable to, but the Kyoto (old New Otani) in LA's LIttle Tokyo, but in my opinion, just a bit fresher."
94,2085,"Feb 9 2009 	Reasonable but disappointing	The room was decent and had been recently renovated to about 80%. The amenities are mostly absent. The fitness room is joke and the &quot;Kabuki Spa&quot; is actually blocks away. The place is in the middle of nowhere, the nearest point of interest is over a 1 1/2 miles away. Add at least $30 a day for cabs. Don't bother if you drive, the parking is always full. Even the closest decent breakfast place (the buffet is not even close to standard) is a mere 12 blocks, which makes for a nice, brisk morning walk.Don't order room service unless you want to get ripped off. A item of $14 dollars arrived with a bill of $24 by the time they added various suspect charges. There is a cool tea set in the room but no coffee.The price wasn't too bad for an off-season rate in San Francisco @ $140/night for deluxe room. The building engineer, housekeeping and some of the doormen are friendly but the rest of the staff is ice cold."
95,2085,"Feb 8 2009 	Delightful!	My daughter is studying Japanese, and for her 16th birthday we wanted to do something special. We booked a night at the Kabuki, and got a great rate for a deluxe double/double for her and 3 friends, and a corner king for my husband and me. Both rooms were very attractively furnished, elicited &quot;wow&quot; from all. Our corner king was great, lots of room, enjoyed relaxing on the chaise lounge looking at the view while husband snored away. Bathrooms were also lovely. We've traveled in Japan, so it was fun to have the Japanese style shower/bath. Service at front desk was very good, room service fine, dinner downstairs at O Izakaya was good enough, girls loved the coconut mochi dessert. It's a great location for walking around Japantown or Fillmore (lower Pacific Heights), catching a movie at the Sundance Kabuki Theatre or at the AMC on Van Ness. We had a great meal at Maki in Japantown, pleasant breakfast at the Majestic Cafe, and then dropped the girls off on Haight Street. It's a quick bus, drive or cab ride to downtown. We parked the car in the garage for a few hours but then on the street for free Sat and Sunday. The only downside? Sound insulation wasn't fabulous - we were on one of the top floors but could hear traffic and could also hear people in the room next door. But all in all, a great place, love the Joie de Vivre hotels, and would highly recommend this to anyone."
96,2085,"Jan 28 2009 	An Aussie in Japan Town	This was our first visit to San Francisco and we selected the Kabuki on the reviews and offer on the net. Overall the Kabuki offers good value and reasonable accomodations. We booked a renovated room with king bed and like other reviewers have noted the rooms are getting a little tired with worn carpet and wall paper, though beds and furniture are all newish and comfortable. The hotel resturant/bar &quot;Izakaya Lounge&quot; was excellent with friendly an attentive staff and good quality Japaness style food at reasonable prices. The Hotel breakfast was the usual choice of &quot;Continetal or American cooked breakfast&quot; and was appetising and reasonably priced. The one problem that we encountered was noise, the hotel is not adequatley insulated from street noise (we were on the sixth floor)and internal noise insulation between rooms is also poor. Unfortunatley this alone would effect our decision to stay at the Kabuki again, though younger travellers or night owls would probably not mind this but after a long flight and being jetlagged we did."
97,2085,"Jan 5 2009	Understated well thought-out loved it	My husband and I stayed in a corner king room on Christmas day, and left the car parked in the Japan Town Center lot. Recommended by a friend, and I loved it! Nice designs, simple, understated, but well-thought out. Nice touches: shoji screens in front of sliding glass doors offer privacy, daylighting, and insulation. Way nicer than the typical blackout curtains. Cool wood block print panels decorate the walls. Electric kettle and tea pot in the room. Japanese soaking tub was fantastic.They covered all the things that irritate me about other hotels and the lions-share of American buildings. Little things that I loved: the coat / shoe closet is by the front door; the toilet is separate from the shower and sink; the toilet is mounted on the wall (sans the grody caulking on the floor); there is a drain in the floor of the bath area.If you want something &quot;luxurious&quot;, or gigantic this probably isn't the spot for you. But if you want a central location, like going to Japanese shops, and appreciate something different at a fair price, Kabuki is the way to go. I'd say a Marriott is to Kabuki, like a Lincoln Navigator is to a Prius. I dig the Prius, and I loved Kabuki."
98,2085,"Dec 18 2008 	Nice for something a bit different	Clean, small room. Restaurant downstairs was overpriced and doesn't fit with the theme of the place. They charged me for some charitable donation on my bill without asking me. Otherwise a decent place with some good restaurants nearby."
99,2085,"Dec 17 2008	Excellent Value	We stayed at Hotel Kabuki for two nights in the cold of winter for $89 per night which was fantastic value. The room was warm and immaculately clean, with a nice bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, with soft, cosy linen. The staff were helpful. We had a car and parked it in the associated car park for $15 for 24 hours and chose to walk around instead. The hotel is approximately 25 minutes walk to Union square, which we didn't mind at all. If you don't fancy the walk, bus 38 runs along Geary street behind the hotel. Japanese food near the hotel was fantastic. If you don't mind the location, we would highly recommend this hotel for cleanliness and great value."
100,2085,"Dec 2 2008 	Great Hotel Stellar Service!	We stayed at Kabuki last month for my birthday weekend in S.F. It was our second stay there, and will probably not be our last. We found it the first time 2 years ago (then Miyako) because of it's low rate and relative closeness to the things we like but far enough away from the tourist traps that we like to visit but don't want to be stuck in. The rates were a little higher this time around (still cheaper than many comparable hotels we found) but then I got an email that said buy 2 nights get a 3rd free, we figured what the heck and made a long weekend out of it.We love staying in Japantown, it's so much quieter than Union Square yet it's still close enough to take a 5 minute cab ride, or 30 minute walk. The rooms are fantastic, great views from almost any room. Sunken soaking tubs, newer tv's, and free internet! There's plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby--and in the hotel, though we didn't try it the breakfast sounded amazing, we were just on a tight budget and it wasn't the &quot;cheapest&quot; you could find--and great shopping in the Miyako mall.BUT, the best part was the service. The front desk crew was very nice and the doormen would always greet you with a smile. And to top it off, I left a personalized frame I brought with me that my sister gave me, we were in town for a show and the frame held a picture of us with this comedian we were there to see and was personalized with a quote from him so I wanted him to sign it. I left it behind with my ticket stub and remembered it hours after we left. I called and they found it right away and proceeded to FedEx it to me. And they were all so helpful every step of the way, I called more than once. They even carefully wrapped each part of my frame in bubble wrap--it's two separate pieces of glass that sit in a personalized silver frame, all very fragile--and then wrapped it up tightly in a towel. I was very pleased that they took such good care of something that was obviously important to me and couldn't be replaced. I've experienced similar situations at other hotels that didn't even bother to look for my items--albeit much less important items but still.And did I mention the Garden!!! It's truly a beautiful hotel, if you're looking for something off the beaten path and enjoy Japanese food and culture than I would highly recommend Kabuki."
101,2085,"Nov 25 2008 	Eh!	I think it helps to know who writes these reviews, so here is some basic information: My husband and I are in our mid - late 30's. We like HIlton, Marriott-type of hotels and also like to splurge on hotels and nice B&amp;B's when given a chance. Here's the review:It was fine. It seemed like a converted Holiday Inn. The shower was great, there were robes in the room, which we love. However, our toilet ran the entire time, we were promised a complimentary tea service that didn't come both times we ordered it and a dirty food tray from our next door neighbors sat outside our room for at least 36 hours before being picked up. All the customer service people always seemed overwhelmed.We wanted to park in the lot associated with the hotel, but it was full both times we tried. So, we parked in a garage the hotel recommended and was attached to the hotel. Nothing went right with it - the automatic payment machines didn't work. And, then we were told the garage opened at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday (we had to leave at exactly 6:00, probably a little earlier to return a rental car and make a flight). As we were making our way to the garage, a hotel guard told us the garage wasn't open till 7:00 and that we would have to pay him $50/cash to open the gates. We kept pushing back because it sounded fishy and then we asked someone at the front desk who told us the garage opened at 6:00. We went to the garage and waited for someone to open the gate and they said the garage didn't open till 6:15. We begged him to open the doors early and let us out because we were already late for flight - thank goodness he did.I would not return to this hotel and would have given a lower rating, but for $109/night in San Francisco, it was o.k. with us."
102,2085,"Nov 22 2008 	Great Location 	Conveniently located on Geary Street, we enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Hotel Kabuki. The hotel is recently renovated, and its minimalist Japanese architecture and furniture actually worked exceptionally well for us as we were traveling with our two toddler sons. After being couped up in an airplane or our rented car our sons loved the wide open spaces in our two room suite. From the moment we arrived, the staff was very attentive to our needs. The valet parking our car asked me my name only once, and from that point for our entire four night stay we were greeted warmly by name every time we arrived or left. The hotel operator cheerfully handled our three year repeatedly calling her (to our horror!) The rooms were clean, and the queen sized bed we had was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we have ever slept in. The Kabuki is nicely located close enough to all the major sites in San Francisco, with exceptionally convenient access to the highway as well.All in all we were very satisfied with our stay, and look forward to visiting again."
103,2085,"Nov 18 2008 	Love that soaking tub	Great neighborhood, great concept and great service at the Kabuki. We had a corner king room with a soaking tub and separate shower. The room is huge with two large sliding doors with sliding japanese screens and sliding covers, so privacy and quiet from street noise is excellent. Many nice touches, tea set, wall insets, divan, robes, etc.Granted the furnishings aren't the newest and the sliding door did not close all the way, but this in no way lessened our enjoyment. Not every single thing has to be brand new to work well. That said, new flat screen TV was excellent with free internet provided as well. Elevators came instantly and pleasant shopping abounds in surrounding Japantown. You can usually find overnight parking for free on the street if you wake by 9 or you can park in an adjacent garage for $15.00 per night. Full valet parking is $35.00 per day if you are a high roller.Don't forget to ask for a room on a higher floor to enjoy excellent views. One problem though, in asking for directions I mispronounced the hotel name as &quot;Bukaki&quot; and was met with guffaws for some unknown reason."
104,2085,"Nov 14 2008 	Hotel Kabuki a modern theatrical opera	The Hotel Kabuki is reminiscent of a Japanese theatre.On the surface it has all of the glam of a modern theatrical opera, but once you stay awhile you realize it's an opera that's seen its hey day. 1) The so-called newly-renovated guestrooms look like they were renovated in the late 80s -early 90s. You should see the huge stereo t.v. in the club lounge. It definitely will not work when digital t.v. comes to town. Also, the fitness center needs an upgrade.2) There is false advertisement on the hotel brochure-The courtesy shuttle is not always reliable. -the 24 hr. business ctr. has an inoperable printer,so don't count on using it! In fact, count on being chargedextra to use it. (long story...)-the complimentary wine (sake) hour doesn't exist, sobuy your own wine elsewhere.On the flip side, the hotel is quiet and has somecharms like the Sjoji window screens, traditional tea in room, and Asian bedding.Just remember that the hotel needs some TLC (tender loving care) and hopefully one day the Hotel Kabuki will shine again!"
105,2085,Oct 17 2008 	Overvalued hotel	Even though they remodeled the hotel. it is still far to be 31/2-star hotel. you don't have any controls on air conditioning and heating systems. Just hope you're in right season to avoid these problems. the front desk won't tell you this until you check-in... be aware...
106,2085,"Oct 7 2008 	Adored the Kabuki	We stayed in the Kabuki unfortunately only for one night at the end of our trip across CA and we absolutely loved it, the hotel itself, the theme, the room, the gardens, the food was delicious, service brilliant and we will be back there as soon as we can , a treasure in SF :)"
107,2085,"Oct 6 2008 	Best Bathrooms 	I stayed in the double room for a few nights in September, 2008. The bathroom was the best I've seen outside Tokyo and Seoul. Beyond the large area for the sink and toilet, the shower was in another alcove behind a glass door. There were multiple showers (2 shower heads on opposite walls and 3 body sprays near one of them), there was a tile bench along one wall that you could sit on while you took a shower if you chose the removable showerhead opposite the one with 3 body sprays. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom. The beds were also extremely comfortable. Service was immediate and friendly. The bath products were from Lather, and they smelled wonderful. I go to an annual convention in San Fran, and this is the first time I've stayed almost my entire time in the hotel- I took a couple long showers daily and read in bed all day. Although I stay at different hotels every year, I will book at the Kabuki from now on. This room was so nice that I'll book better rooms in the future. This is not like any of the other 4 star hotels. If you care about the 2 things top on my list for a hotel- the bathroom and the bed, you won't go wrong at the Kabuki."
108,2085,"Sep 29 2008 	the Kabuki was very pleasant	I researched for days to visit during one of the busiest times of the year, I was looking for unique, away from the hustle bustle of union square and I found it at the Kabuki. We chose the Corner KIng and we had lovely views of the city. The decor was minimalistic and serenely Japanese and lovely. The hotel staff was very professional and accomodating. The parking was great...you must expect to spend at least 25-35 dollars to valet park in this city anywhere. The staff: the hosts, bartenders and valets, ad housekeepers were all very accomodating. The Japanese tub was super. The Kabuki was simply...a very pleasant stay."
109,2085,Sep 24 2008 	A great place to stay in SF!	Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco's Japantown is a great alternative to the often over-crowded and over-priced hotel scene near Union Square. We had a lovely 250 sq foot room with a balcony. The entire hotel has been recently renovated and is definitely worth a look. They have a gerat lounge/restaurant as well.
110,2085,"Sep 22 2008	Good hotel but a little out of the way	Stayed for a Saturday night in September. Am a fairly recent visitor to SF ans know my way around reasonably well though I'd never stayed in Japan Town before....and to be honest I doubt I'll stay in the area again. If you want to be close to 'downtown' you're better staying elsewhere.The hotel isn't the cheapest although the views from the corner room were quite impressive.The public car park is reasonably priced and easy to access as the hotel has an elevator directly to the underground levels, ask nicely and the hotel will even validate your ticket even if it's not included in your room rate :)"
111,2085,Sep 8 2008 	Great Room - Loved the Bath 	We stayed for one night and asked for a King Corner with the special tub. The room was clean and spacious with a very comfy bed. The tub was terrific and felt amazing. We got a room on the 13th floor (note that the ice machines are on even numbered floors) and loved the view. Great location.
112,2085,"Sep 4 2008 	Hotel Kabuki Excellent for Price	In San Francisco third week of August 2008--booked three star hotels via Priceline--two were excellent; one was bad. Highly recommend Hotel Kabuki and Kensington Park which you might get on-line for $100-$125. Beware hotels &quot;under renovation&quot; or no-frills, &quot;Boutique&quot;. Don't want to identify the latter hotel because manager was so nice, but arrived with 3 TV channels, spotty wi-fi, faced a brick wall, mold. Hotel company (SF has Personality Hotels, Kimpton, Joie d' Vivre, etc.) did book me into much better accommodations."
113,2085,"Sep 1 2008 	Perfect for us	We stayed at the Kabuki in Japantown for three nights while interviewing for jobs. It was perfect for us: not too fussy or ostentatious, but nice touches like very clean, new sheets and bedding (supremely comfy beds) and toiletries and friendly staff. I was worried it was going to be over-the-top with the Japanese theme, but it was tasteful and not at all like the amusement park I feared it would be. We had a really nice view (we were on the 12th floor facing North) and it was a nice to be in a convenient yet calm and not noisy part of town. Free wireless, decent tv. Wonderful deep Japanese-style bathtub, eucalyptus salts provided. This is no fancy dancy hotel, but it's clean, comfortable and the details are attended to. Also very convenient to buses. The restaurant was good (with the exception of the Udon that I got from room service) and the hostess went out of her way to help us. The little pond with koi fish was tiny but a nice touch.We got a cheap bundle deal of plane plus hotel from Travelocity."
114,2085,Aug 31 2008 	Great place to stay in japantown	The rooms are spacious with great Japanese bathrooms and breakfasts. I would recommend this place especially if you can get a good deal on the room rate.
115,2085,"Aug 28 2008 	Doesn't worth the price at all!!!	I stayed three nights at the Kabuki Hotel. The room is not what you would expect for a 270$ / night. The windows were old and didn't close properly so the room was noisy. The balcony was shared with all the floor and even they have a sticky on the window saying that was safe to left the window open.The first day they began to clean the room but forgot to finish it. They left the wet and dirty towels over the bed, and did'nt clean the room. I also asked a hight floor with views three months before my arrival (to avoid street noises) and all I've got was a second floor room.I payed a supplement to have &quot;citi views&quot; and therefore I was expecting a nice room in the tower but all i've got was the second floor with views to a secondary street.I found a lot of Motels, even in in San Francisco, with better rooms, better services and for less than a 1/3 of the price."
116,2085,"Aug 23 2008 	Lousy	I expected a quality hotel with excellent service. I am sorry to say that the stay was not worth the money, the service was in one word: lousy. It did not even meet the service of a 1 star hotel. So the Joie de Vivre story of experience this and that is all bla bla to me if you cannot even achieve the basic standards of service."
117,2085,"Aug 21 2008 	Excellent bed but better stay in Union Square	I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of july because I like Japanese stuff but these is not really Japanese, just a few pictures and decoration. Excellent bed and bathroom, very clean and very near Japantown shopping mall and restaurants and Fillmore restaurants at walking distance. You can take the bus 3 different busses to Union Square, the bus stop is really near and it's just 8 minutes.Cold welcome and behaviour from receptionist.Part of Joy de Vivre Hotels, which are really lovely and should recommend."
118,2085,"Aug 17 2008 	Once is enough	Good location, very comfortable beds, good restaurant breakfast, mostly courteous staff, beautiful garden; however, the room was hot (no air conditioning), they charge for Internet use in the business center, television had very few channels, bathroom area not private enough. Glad I stayed there, but will only do once."
119,2085,"Jul 28 2008 	Some Style Limited Substance	I'm not that impressed with Hotel Kabuki as I wrap up a four-night stay in a recently renovated room. A longtime resident of San Francisco before moving abroad, I heard good things about this hotel when it was known as the Miyako. It seems quality has been compromised some since then. It should be known that the hotel's location is a good one. On the edge of SF's small but charming Japantown, it is close to major bus lines on both Geary Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue. The smartly appointed hotel lobby and courteous Front Desk staff provided a great first impression. The room itself was also nicely decorated and gave the feel of a bonafide boutique hotel. But problems cropped up almost immediately. The toilet was not at all clean, basic complimentary amenities were missing (and remained missing well after housekeeping passed through the next morning; I only secured the amenities once I asked for them directly), and the guest robe hung in the closet had fresh make-up stains on the inside from a previous guest. The television remote control was missing, and when I called to get a replacement was grilled by the Front Desk agent about whether or not I had done a thorough search of the room for the remote control rather than be told another would be sent up straightaway. The hallways proved noisy in the evening, and a neighbor's half-eaten dinner ordered through Room Service remained on the hallway floor for well over twelve hours. Otherwise, one of the two doormen seemed to do everything possible not to make eye contact with entering and exiting guests. Not exactly hospitality in action. In isolation, each one of these problems seems minor. But together, they point to the fact that Hotel Kabuki is more style than substance ... especially given the price."
120,2085,"Jul 23 2008 	A Taste of Japan	We stayed at the Kabuki because our first choice wasn't available... luckily! Because we really liked the Kabuki. The reception was fast, helpful, friendly, professional. The place itself was calm and peaceful and well appointed. And the room, a corner room (1111) was small but perfect. We had views of the city, a small balcony, a nice Japanese tub in the bathroom and a very comfortable bed. We were able to easily use the internet from our room. We had drinks and h'ors d'ouevres downstairs, which were delicious. And then we ate dinner across the street at bushi-tei, which was also very delicious. The whole experience was enjoyable, beginning to end. And we liked the towels so much, we bought two of them to take home!!"
121,2085,"Jul 18 2008 	Better place to spend money	We stayed there three days ago for one night and vowed we will never go back.We were looking forward to staying there and we chose this place to spend our last night of our trip in San Francisco.The welcome tea ceremony that was promised never took place. The room was smelly and when I went to wash my face I saw the finger nail on the basin. Yuk.The Internet connection was bad. Took 10 mins to open a webpage. You need to connect and reconnect repeatedly.Then next morning when we went to have breakfast in the hotel's restaurant it took more than 10 mins for someone to take the order. Had I not voiced out my displeasure it might take more than 20 mins. I saw a family whose father also lost patience becasue of the same issue.There are many better places in San Francisco to stay, definitely not this one. We so regreted of making such decision and decided to pst this message so other people will not have to go through what we experienced."
122,2085,"Jul 17 2008 	Loved This Hotel	Our friends and we were attending a wedding in SF and found it quite a challenge to find a reasonable hotel. So, in our search, we found Hotel Kabuki. The men are not especially adventurous and they wondered if a Japanese hotel would be very different. Well, we booked it and were very happy we did. The parking was easy (though we did use the valet parking), the rooms were very clean, the Japanese decor was striking and the staff were as nice as can be.The sheets were so soft and the pillows were great also. The bathrooms were way above standard with some of the baths including an entrance shower to the tub. Bath salts were included as were directions on how to take a traditional Japanese bath. When we returned from dinner and entered our room, a guest had broken the rule and smoked somewhere and it was just drifting into our room. I called the desk and they moved us without delay and gave us a $15 dollar each credit for breakfast. The restaurant in the hotel was exceedingly expensive and the food was not very good. The cod I got tasted like wonder bread (still cannot figure this out), the hamburger was great, the drinks were also grossly overpriced, the morning coffee to go for $3.00 could be obtained across the street for $1.75 (in the mall) and the omlettes were overcooked and dry. The room did have free instant coffee. My husband and I would not eat at this restaurant again.But the hotel - we would go in a heartbeat. The experience was great fun. Have a good time!"
123,2085,"Jun 29 2008 	Could be a very special place with some improvements	The Joie de Vivre hotels group, of which Hotel Kabuki belongs, impressed us greatly when we stayed in their Domain Hotel in Sunnyvale. That hotel was bright, new and modern.  The Kabuki in Japantown has some of the same qualities, although with a very Japanese style of decor. The lobby is pretty impressive, and the staff is polite. We had a Deluxe Corner room on the 15th floor, to take advantage of the bird's-eye view from our balcony. We enjoyed the view, and were lucky to witness the &quot;Critical Mass&quot; demonstration/celebration (depending on how you view it) take place right below our windows. The elevator is lightning fast, but the ride is very smooth. The sliding screens over the windows/balcony doors in our room with Japanese illustrations on them, the black framed furniture and the Japanese-style fabrics gave the room a distinct feel. The traditional soaking tub did as well, although we did not use it that way most of the time (we preferred to shower). The bed, with a pillowtop surface, was very comfortable. The usual amenities are there -- hairdryer, safe, refrigerator, shampoo and conditioner. The kimono-style robes were a nice touch, though the robes seemed a bit old. So the style was as we'd hoped, but the rooms are a bit worn and in need of remodeling. There is a hot pot in the room for boiling water for tea, and a set of tea cups and a small tea pot. Providing only two tea bags seemed a bit stingy, though. There was no coffee maker however, which was disappointing to my husband. Even though this is in the heart of Japantown, most Americans still like to have coffee in the room. The tiny frig was so full of honor bar drinks, there was no room at all for leftover food we brought to our room. One thing I wish the room had was a door to the bathroom sink area. The toilet is in its own room with a locking door, and there is a wall separating the bathroom/toilet area from the main room, but the shower stall door is clear glass, and a lack of another door there takes away some of the privacy, especially if you want to shower or wash at the sink while you have someone visiting your room. A door to the area would also minimize noise from someone using the sink or shower that might disturb someone else sleeping in the bed.  The hotel needs to improve its concierge service. The staff directs guests to the doorman on duty for this, and the doormen don't seem to know much. We asked about getting to Golden Gate Park and where to park, but the doorman neglected to tell us about the no-left turns on most streets and the many one-way streets. He also left out the fact that the Asian Art Museum in the Park has a huge parking lot, and instead told us to park on one street south of the park. So our drive there was very frustrating. The next day, we asked the doorman (a different one) about getting to Point Reyes to the north, and he had no idea what that was or how to get there without looking at a map. And he had no maps to give to us. Even if the hotel may be catering to business people, they should know how to advise guests on tourist activities. We booked the room by calling the hotel directly, and got a great deal at $150 avg. per night (this was for June 2008). My relatives staying in the hotel paid almost as much through Expedia for a smaller, less interesting room. Parking in the nearby municipal garage was $15 per day, which is $10 less than the hotel's garage rate, and $20 less than in the Fisherman's Wharf area. The hotel is in a nice area -- especially Fillmore St., with its many small shops and restaurants. And there is no lack of Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood. We also like the Soko Hardware Store across the street on Post, and the Ichiban (Dollar Store-like) store in the attached mall. If they remodel, upgrade some of the amenities, and improve their concierge service, this hotel will be quite wonderful."
124,2085,"Jun 24 2008 	What a treat!	My daughter read about this hotel on this site and talked usinto staying there. Such a great experiance... beautiful area(we'd never been to Japantown and really enjoyed it) thehotel is beautiful and the rooms heavenly. The Komono robeswere a surprise we weren't expecting. Also after checking inthe front desk called up to ask if we had everything we neededand to tell us about the evening tea... just call the front deskif we'd like to have complimentary tea between 6 and 9. We did and it was wonderful loose leaf tea served to usin a little tea pot with glasses and honey with lemon.The rooms were beautiful we had a view of Japantown, and beautiful rice shoju screens and painted japanesewomen on the wooden screens. It's a family favorite now..if I had one slight complaint it would be the shower set upcould be a tad more private. We'll definitly be back!!!"
125,2085,"Jun 19 2008 	Weekend trip	Went to SF for the weekend, stayed 2 nights at Hotel Kabuki. It is a beautiful hotel. The bed was very nice. However I had called ahead of time and was told that our room would be the double double with a view and balcony in the tower part of the hotel just like I had reserved online. When we arrived we were told that we were changed to a family suite (an upgrade) but it was in the garden part of the hotel and on the first floor where we had a view of passing cars and no balcony or outside air. When I asked to change rooms the women at the front desk just stammered and stared at their monitors. The air conditioner didn't work so it was very hot in the room. Valet parking was a joke, $25.00 a night and I was told on the second night that I couldn't park there even though there were empty places. Found the staff to be not very friendly and never said thank you or looked us in the eye. I paid a lot of money for a room that I didn't want and was upset the whole time."
126,2085,"Jun 2 2008 	Cool Hotel for a Unique SF Experience	My family (2 adults, 2 teenagers) stayed at the Hotel Kabuki for one night in April, 2008 in order to get an &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; experience and give the kids a taste for what a Japanese hotel is like. The hotel was quite nicely decorated, conveniently connected to a Japanese mall full of Japanese stores &amp; restaurants, and the soaking tub in the bathroom was a nice plus!The kids stayed in a queen size bed in the living room while my wife &amp; I shared a large futon in the tatami bedroom. Both were nicely appointed, and the tatami room reminded me of some hotels I had stayed in in Japan - authentic and comfortable. We even found a sauna in our bathroom just before we checked out - too bad we didn't know sooner that it was there! We didn't eat at the hotel as we felt the breakfast was somewhat overpriced (had I been there on business I might have eaten at the hotel), but we had a decent dinner at one of the many Japanese restaurants in one of the adjacent shopping centers, and we had breakfast at one of the coffee shops in the mall as well. As an added plus, I took advantage of the free use of the Kabuki Spa before checking out. It was a wonderful experience, with a variety of tubs and a great steam room and very relaxing Japanese music. I was there for about an hour, but I could have stayed for at least one more. The hotel was on the expensive side, but it is San Francisco, and we sprung for a suite with the tatami room - a more conventional room with 2 beds would have been less expensive. the tatami bedroom was very cool"
127,2085,"Jun 2 2008 	A great place to stay central to everything.	This hotel came highly recommended to us. We wanted to stay a few days in the Japan Town area of San Francisco for a few days when on holidays. The property has recently undergone renovations and is nicely done. The rooms are still a tiny bit dated, but the product in the rooms, especially the beds (kings beds, with feather duvets, amazing egyptian linens) They have a restaurant on site (Japanese and western style food) A must to experience, the servers in the dining room go out of their way to service you. There is a ton of restaurants and shops right across the street and in close walking distance to the hotel.The wharf, pier 39, shops are close, you can hop on a trolley just 10 minutes from the hotel and head to all the attractions at the wharf.Would for sure recommend this hotel as a place to stay when in San Francisco."
128,2085,"May 29 2008 	Beware Room 411	Overall, we had a nice stay. I got a good deal on Travelocity airfare/hotel package at Hotel Kabuki. We checked in on a Wednesday afternoon, we were given our keys for room 411. At first glance, the room looked ok; that was until we opened the curtains and looked out the window. All we could see were cement walls and the restaurant exhaust system - an ugly, rusty sight. When we looked straight up, we saw a tiny bit of sky.I went back to the front desk and politely asked if we could change rooms and have one where we could actually see something out of the window. The hostess asked if we needed a king bed or a japanese tub. I told her that we could do with a queen bed and the japanese tub was unnecessary. She said she would upgrade us at no cost to a King room on the concierge floor with jetted tub. We checked into room 2504. It was very pretty with a big, wide window with rice paper screens that opened to reveal a view of the city in both directions and the hotel Japanese Garden below. The jetted tub was very large and deep.Concierge floor means complimentory continental breakfast. Thursday morning at 7:30 they set up coffee, fresh fruit, large sweet rolls, cereal, milk, and juice. Friday morning - no continental breakfast, not even coffee. We were in a hurry to go sight seeing so we didn't bother asking. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, they left a sign in the breakfast area saying that there would be no continental breakfast but we could pick up a voucher at the front desk to use in the hotel restaurant. The voucher was worth $12 pp and was to be applied to our restaurant bill. The breakfast food was good. One day the service was very slow and the next day it was fast.We enjoyed our room and the hotel. We loved the Japanese decor, modern lobby, and Japanese Garden. Japantown is a little bit out of the way from tourist attractions but is on a main bus line so transportation was easy and convenient. We enjoyed the serenity of Japantown after the fast pace of downtown. The area was clean and the malls and stores were fun and interesting."
129,2085,"May 26 2008 	Delightful Oasis in Japantown	After arriving at the hotel from a late flight, I was informed at check-in that I didn't have a reservation (no thanks to my administrative assistant who forgot). Nonetheless, the front desk person, Sherman, was very helpful. The lobby is just beautiful and room is an oasis from the hustle of the city. Our conference facilities were excellent. The bar and restaurant are exceptional. I would highly recommend this hotel."
130,2085,"May 24 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	Booking: I contacted the hotel directed to make reservations. It turned out to be less than any website. We paid $112 for each room a night, however, it was on weekdays. Checking In: We arrived an hour early and to my surprise they had our rooms ready immediately, which was nice since we had been traveling all day.Interior: I loved the Japanese theme of the hotel yet it still remained western enough to not feel like it was over board. Simple and elegant. RoomsKing Room: Nice and clean. The only thing is that it is a bit small to have any visitors, but its perfectly fine for just two people.Deluxe Double Room: Once again very nice and clean. We love the little sitting area. Since there were 7 people traveling (only 4 stay at the hotels), we used this room as a hang out place at times. Service: The front desk was very accommodating and answered any questions that we had. Housekeeping always did a wonderful job with the rooms. Valet however was not always available but parking was easy.Amenities and Dining: Since we were not in the hotel during the day very often, I cannot review on the amenities or the restaurant . We wish we could have taken advantage of what the hotel had to offer but there is so much to do in SF. We love the little mini mall that is attach to the hotel especially Ichiban USA. It is a wonderful place to buy little snacks and souvenirs for friends and family. So inexpensive and fun.Places to go in SF:-Check out Coit Tower at night and during the day if you have time.-We had dinner in North Beach one night, which is highly recommended.-One of our favorite activities was taking a small road trip to Stinson Beach. From San Francisco after crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, take Hwy. 101 North approximately three miles to the &quot;Hwy. One, Stinson Beach&quot; exit. Follow the signs and enjoy your drive down one of the most scenic highways in the nation. Stinson Beach is approximately 20 miles from San Francisco. Make sure you stop at Muir Beach Outlook, you won't be disappointed."
131,2085,"May 19 2008	Hotel Kabuki- Exceptional	I would like to commend you for having such a wonderful staff at the Kabuki. And w/ that, Ive also got my clients and colleagues to stay there before &amp; we all have the same praises for you guys. Ive stayed at your establishment a couple of times now and I must say, they raise the bar each time - most especially your front desk team, namely Mr. Reyes. As we all know, warmth and fine customer service is part of the industry but he definitely adds more of a personal value into it, &amp; that separates you guys from the clich. Its one thing to get the aesthetic qualities covered but its definitely another to combine it perfectly w/ exceptional service. Keep up the good work and looking forward for another hassle free stay at H.K once again!"
132,2085,"May 8 2008	Kabuki Just Right	We stayed at the Kabuki for one night only on our way to New Zealand but we wished we could have stayed longer. All the staff we encountered were friendly, courteous and hospitable in true Japanese style. The room was comfortable; the hotel was quiet;the general ambience was one of peace and relaxation. We also appreciated the Japanese Garden. It was our kind of hotel. We hope to to stay there again and would like to try other &quot;Joie de Vivre&quot; Hotels in the future if there are up to the same standard as the Kabuki."
133,2085,Apr 17 2008 	Very nice and fair price	This was a very nice hotel. It was in the Japanese area of the city and the staff were very accomodating. I had a king room with a view and the view itself was worth it. I overlooked the TransAmerica building to the left and the bay to the right. Truly breath taking. The price online at the hotel website was the most reasonable that I could find and it was under other hotel costs in the area. Since it was a business trip I had limited time and was not able to travel to the off-site bath house however the soaking tub in the room was amazing. I thiink that the hotel would be very comfortable for Japanese visitors as well. The menus contained half American dishes and half Japanese dishes. There were other nearby dining options if neither suited you. The only 2 things I was unsure of were whether I received club points for the Joie de Vivre membership I got right before booking my trip and whether someone was to come to the room with tea service (since I had this impression from a pre-stay email from the hotel). Neither of these factors affected my feeling about the stay whatsoever.
134,2085,"Apr 6 2008 	A really nice alternative.	We had a week in San Francisco for a convention and decided to take our two kids. That meant looking for a suite, so that we could put the kids to bed in one room and still stay up and watch TV and visit with friends in the other. The Kabuki had a variety of reasonably-priced suites that fit the bill, for just a bit more than a regular double room at the big-name convention hotel. (Note: the Kabuki's 'East-West' suite, with one Western bedroom and one Japanese tatami room, does not adequately isolate one room's sound from the other.) The 'Junior Suite' was great for our purposes. The kids had the big bed in their room while we had a foldaway futon in ours.The hotel is newly remodeled (it was the Miyako when I lived out there), and very comfortable. The staff seemed to be changing constantly, so it was hard to find a regular, 'go-to' person; however, everyone was professional and pleasant enough.Japantown is a nice part of the city, with plenty of (mostly Asian) dining options very close to the hotel. We found we could walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (we made the obligatory tourist trek up over Hyde Street to Fisherman's Wharf and even walked to the Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park). When we needed cabs, they were easy to find.The only drawbacks I can think of were the lack of any sort of bathrobes in the room -- a bit odd for a Japanese-style hotel -- and the rather slow wireless Internet. Also, refrigerators in the suites would be nice (NOT just for the idiotic mini-bar -- does anyone actually buy that overpriced crap?) However, all in all, we would gladly go back, and we were very glad we opted for the Kabuki over the mega-chain conference hotel."
135,2085,"Apr 5 2008	Very Nice Hotel with good location in Japantown	We recently spent 3 nights in this recently renovated and renamed hotel in Japantown. It was our second stay there and both times we got a very nice &quot;view room&quot; with lots of room, good views of San Francisco, and a Japanese bath. The staff was very friendly. Both times we enjoyed promotional rates which were very good for San Francisco. This time the service was somewhat lacking--we didn't get our complimentary welcome wine or our daily newspaper. Also a couple items were missed during the room cleaning one day. Breakfast service in the bar was very slow (and expensive) both times we tried it. But overall it was a pleasant stay at a good price."
136,2085,"Apr 5 2008	Four-star prices without four-star service	I recently stayed at the Hotel Kabuki and found it, in a word, disappointing. The hotel is nice, that much is for certain, but patrons are not offered four-star caliber service to match the hotel's four-star prices.Upon arrival, I had expected to receive help with my two large suitcases and three personal bags, but there was no one to be found at the door---no doorman, no bell hop, nothing. I towed my luggage to the front desk, and while check-in was swift, I was not offered assistance with my bags. Worse, I was given insufficient directions to my room in the &quot;Garden Wing&quot; and found myself lost within five minutes of checking in to the property. I returned to the front desk and was given better directions by a different attendant. Had I not been saddled with so many bags, this episode might not have even registered as a negative...as it was, by the time I got to my room I was annoyed and fatigued.First impression: The room itself was billed as an &quot;Executive Sauna Suite.&quot; It consisted of two large rooms: a sitting/work area and a bedroom with attached bath and sauna. Though the rooms had recently been remodeled, damage had already set-in and made parts of the room look dingy. The paper on the shoji screens was ripped in several places, scuff marks dotted the walls, and the ceiling looked like it had been repaired and repainted several times. It was obvious that many of the flat surfaces in the bathroom had been somewhat shoddily re-faced with granite, rather than entirely replaced. In short, the room was nice, but far from perfect.Details: The Ipod dock was nice, but there was a dearth of convenient outlets for charging my laptop, phone, and camera. Adequate, comfortable bedding was appreciated. The toiletries were okay, and the towels were fluffy and only a few bore stains from previous users. Two flat-screen television sets featured a small number of stations from which to choose. With the drapes open, the room was nice and bright. During the evening hours, even with all the lamps on, the room was annoyingly dim. The lighting in the bathroom was the worst I have seen in some time. Most four-star hotels provide its occupants with some kind of lighted magnifying mirror for grooming, but not Hotel Kabuki. As a result, morning tasks were more difficult and more tiresome than they needed to be. Overall, the hotel was quiet. I only heard my neighbors a few times. Free wi-fi was nice when it worked. Special Bathroom Note: The bath area was separated from the sink area, which was also separated from the toilet. There was a door separating the bedroom from all of this. Each area had its own door, and privacy was never a concern. Room Service: Avoid the hotel's room service at all costs. It was overpriced, of course, and of exceedingly poor quality. I ordered dinner, which was only mediocre, and, on the day I checked-out, I ordered a scrambled egg breakfast which was inedible. The eggs were sulfurous and undercooked, the sausage was disgusting, the pastries were lacking, and the coffee was bitter. Worse, it was delivered by hasty staff interested not in presenting the meal but in collecting the tip. There is an art to room service that this hotel has not mastered. I assume the Denny's across the street would have been a better bet for both food and service.Housekeeping: Housekeeping was efficient and adequate. No complaints. (And no interruptions.)Business Center: I found it annoying that the business center;s computers are not free to use. Printing on their network looked to be a hassle, so I took my laptop to my room and wrote out information longhand.The day I checked out, a bellman was available to help with my bags and make first contact with my driver. That was an improvement.I doubt I would stay here again...unless I had a significant discount. The Kabuki wants to be a four-star hotel, but until they master the art of hospitality and true service, they will not deserve that rank."
137,2085,"Mar 30 2008 	Nice Room Poor Service	We got the executive suite with a sauna for a really good price during the middle of the week. The room was great, with a few minor details missing. The bath could use a new caulking and the dry sauna didn't get very hot (needed the steam to make it hot). The phone didn't work in the bedroom and after telling them, no one came to fix it. Which gets me to the service... When we checked in, we were not told to go up different elevators than in the lobby, so that was annoying. We were not offered the tea service. We were on the club floor with free breakfast. The coffee was empty and after asking the front for more, they never brought it (even 45 minutes later!). The location was great and the room was quiet. If we had a cheap room here, we would probably stay again, but this time won't expect 4 star service to go with the four star room."
138,2085,Mar 26 2008 	A 4 Star plus in my book!	This is a very nice hotel and should be rated 4 star. The staff is friendly and they have a free wine reception each evening in the lobby. The room was extra nice on the 5th floor club level. Breakfast was included on that floor also. Location in Japantown was very nice and unique. Also there were no bums laying on the sidewalk and begging like you see at the downtown hotels. A cab to Union Square is $8 or the Muni bus runs about every 5 minutes past the hotel on Geary and only costs $1.50. I will be sure to return to the Hotel Kabuki next time in San Francisco.
139,2085,"Mar 22 2008 	great location we'll stay there again	A friend recommended this hotel and we were not dissappointed. Great location and easy access to public transportation. Our room had a great view, was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the japanese style bathtub was fantastic to soak in after a day of climbing all those hills. The attached restaurant was pricey but the breakfast was good. Our only complaints are minor ones: when we arrived no one seemed interested in helping us with our baggage and the room decor seemed to be a stranage mishmash of Asian and Western style decor, but that's just being picky. Try to get a room with a view, and take advanatage of that deep Japanese style soaking tub."
140,2085,"Mar 21 2008	good option	Good value for money city hotel. Can access the city via public transport with little difficulty but use the local bus route map. Althought it is not &quot;down town&quot; it gives options to get to other parts of the city. The Japantown area is really good if you are into that thing. There are a few good restaurants to explore but there are some other good areas within easy walk. Good eating and drinking can be found within easy reach. The hotel is comfrtable and cannot be faulted. Bar is excellent. Would I recommend , yes I would. For a base to see SF it is a good bet once you sort out local transport, and that means get the bus map, simple as that."
141,2085,Mar 18 2008 	Ideal place to stay and relax	I have stayed at the Kabubi Hotel (Used to be called Miyako) many times. I can not rate it anything but a great place to stay and relax. The service is great and every one is extremely friendly and competent. The rates are reasonable and the rooms extremely clean and quiet. I always try and plan my trips far enough in advance so I am able to stay there. I can not recommend it enough.Frank Butterfield
142,2085,"Mar 11 2008 	Great place off the beaten path	I stayed at Hotel Kabuki for a convention and couldn't have been happier. When I checked in, they gave me an upgrade to the &quot;club&quot; level. A larger room, one of those wonderful soaking tubs (with whirlpool jets!) and free continental breakfast every morning. The room was wonderful. A king Sleep Number bed, IPOD docking alarm, plenty of room. Loved the free wi-fi. The staff was polite, helpful and attentive. Catching a cab was extremely easy...I never waited more than 5 minutes! I will absolutely stay here again..."
143,2085,"Mar 3 2008 	Alright for a casual trip go elsewhere if you want it to be special!	My husband and I decided to stay here for our brief honeymoon. Too bad we were just not impressed with the service - we've gotten better at a Motel 6!All brides are told that hotels love honeymooners (get the anniversary business, right?). Well, I mentioned that this was our going to be our honeymoon when I booked the room. I replied to the email confirmation stating that this was a honeymoon (they had gotten our # of guests wrong). I even mentioned it at the front desk when we checked in. We weren't expecting extras or anthing, we already had the most expensive room, but a Congratulations would have been nice. (We had a private ceremony, so really not tired of hearing it).Nope, no congratulations. In fact, we got &quot;Call the front desk when you want your welcome tea&quot;, and then she walked away. Gee, thanks, I feel welcome already! In any case, we decided to call the front desk about an hour later. I said, &quot;I had a question about the welcome tea.&quot; Response &quot;Fine, someone will be there with your tea in 15 minutes&quot; and then hung up, no &quot;is that all&quot; or even letting me say thanks or that wasn't what I wanted.Well, my husband and I were in the room for another hour or so. No tea arrived. We finally decided to go to dinner. While leaving, we were joking around, kneeling to close the doors behind us, etc. (We were staying in the Japanese suite, where there are sliding doors from the entry way to the seating area, and more doors to the raised sleeping area). So, we're POSTIVE we closed the doors. When we returned about an hour later, the doors to the seating area AND the sleeping were open. Of course, I called the front desk, while my husband looked to see if anything was missing (or added). The front desk said &quot;No one would enter your room, you must not remember leaving the doors open.&quot; Of course, I said that I was sure we closed them. To which she replied, &quot;No one would enter, thank you&quot; and hung up. Yeeeaaa...At that point, we decided to just stop dealing with the people at the hotel, and just enjoy Japantown.Too bad that at 9am, we had banging on the door for housekeeping. Apparently she decided to ignore the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on our door. I did open the door to make sure it was still on there. Yes, it was hanging nicely from the door handle. What a dirty look I got for pointing it out, and stating that we wouldnt be out of the room until at least 11:30.The room itself was lovely, though. I thoroughly approve of the bath products they place in the room, quality is excellent. The hotel does look better than the last time we stayed there, when we got engaged.We celebrated there after getting engaged. We went there for our brief honeymoon. It was the intention to go back every year for our anniversary... but we think they missed out on that repeat business. Recommended? Not if you want anything resembling courtesy. If you dont care about people being polite, then go for it!"
144,2085,"Mar 1 2008	Can't wait to return!!!	We have never stayed in Japantown before and we must say that it is a great location. We were able to take the bus everywhere. The hotel is wonderfully clean, friendly staff (especially the day doorman) and it has a fun bar. We will go back!"
145,2085,"Feb 29 2008 	I Loved It But Not for Everyone	I really loved my stay at the Hotel Kabuki, but its not a hotel for everyone. Ill elaborate below.The Room: I spent the extra for a corner king room, and I was glad that I did. The room was on the 14th floor, and the view was spectacular! The sliding glass doors on 2 walls were covered with sliding shoji screens and stepped out onto a narrow balcony which ran around the whole corner of the room. The room had a small entry hallway with one closet. Half the closet, though, was filled by a large bookcase which held the minibar, the coffee maker, the coffee service, the safe, and a tray of minibar snacks. Tucked into the open side of the closet were two folded luggage stands. The room itself was large and contained a chaise, a glass-top desk with a TV, a desk chair, a low glass table, and a second chair. The bed was unfortunately one of those almost-a-king beds and my husbands feet stuck off the end. The bed itself was very comfy with a warm duvet and fluffy pillows. On either side of the bed were endtables. Youll note I never said dresser. The room only has half a closet and the two small drawers in each endtable. If you come for a week, or like to unpack fully, youll find yourself living out of your suitcase. The TV was a very low-end flat screen, and we had to wiggle the cables to get a good picture. Because of the arrangement of the room, we also had to pull the desk into the middle of the room to see the TV from the bed. On one of the endtables is a clock/radio that is also an iPod dock, so you can have your favorite music and leave your charger at home. The heat/AC were very old controls, and was strangely noisy on the middle fan setting, but not on low or high. The room was in pretty good shape, although the wallpaper was peeled back where one of the shoji screens rubbed on it.The Bathroom: The bathroom was in 3 sections, the toilet closet with a solid door, the sink area, and the shower/tub separated by a glass door. The room comes with a Japanese bath. If youve never seen one, imagine two tubs side-by-side. Now take out one tub, but leave the faucet and handles and then tile the floor. Make the 2nd tub narrower and pull the sides up to knee height. Where the 1st tub was there is a low wooden stool and small bucket that you use to soap and rinse, then you get into the 2nd tub which is just for soaking. It was also been fitted with a showerhead, for us Americans, but if youre taller than 52 youll need to bend over to rinse your hair. The water pressure was great and the water was always nice and hot. The bathroom comes with an exfoliating soap for your scrub, bath salts for your soak, as well as the usual shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and hairdryer. The toilet closet was quite spacious, so even the largest guy wouldnt feel cramped.Service: Check-in &amp; check-out were quick and pleasant. After you settle into your room, you can call down for complimentary hot tea service. It was served in a great iron teapot. Our doorman  a happy Buddha-shaped guy  recommended a Chinese restaurant across the street that was some of the best Chinese Ive ever had (San Wang Restaurant). The room was always very clean. We called down for extra towels the one night that we took a Japanese bath, and although they took a long time to come, we got a huge stack of towels, two extra bath salts, a roll of TP, and a box of tissues. They had us covered! Every night from 5-6:00 there is free wine and sake in the lobby. We also got a free breakfast and 2-for-1 drank coupon for the hotels restaurant. The breakfast was the usual American buffet, but service was fast and attentive. We also could have gone for free to the Kabuki Springs &amp; Spa which is about a block away, but we didnt have time. The room should have had free wifi, but we could never get a signal  not even in the lobby. There is cab stand right outside the hotel, and a bus stop  block away. The 3-day Passport is a great deal for $18, considering its $5 to ride the cable car just once. Bus service is fast, efficient and runs 24-hours.Overall: This was great, fun hotel. My husband and I loved the Japanese theme. The location right next to the Japan Center gave us tons to eat and tons to shop. The downsides were the short bed, the lack of wifi, the poor TV, the lack of a dresser, and very short shower."
146,2085,"Feb 25 2008	Truly unique boutique hotel	I checked into the Hotel Kabuki simply because I was attending a conference there - no expectations as to the quality or personality of the hotel.I was pleasantly surprised by this unique hotel on the edge of San Francisco's famed Japan Town. It has recently been refurbished (substantially, from what I understand) and is very tasteful. It's quiet and private, with staff who are understated but eager to serve. I was greeted in the lobby with a sake tasting; it was the perfect introduction.My room, a king room on the corner of the 12th floor, was terrific. The Japanese theme holds through to the guest rooms; mine had the additional bonus of being a corner room with a small balcony overlooking Japan Town to the west and Cathedral Hill to the south. The highlight, though, was the Japanese bath . . . a very deep tub meant for soaking with aromatic bath salts. Outside the tub was a separate faucet and stool meant to be used for washing before entering the tub. It was quite an experience!The conference center was well-appointed, and the staff again was very courteous and efficient. The food at the conference was unique and good - not spectacular."
147,2085,"Feb 12 2008 	Terrific Time!	My husband and I celebrated our 24th anniversary at Hotel Kabuki, and we had an amazing time! We arrived in the pouring rain and were pleasantly greeted with sake and wine tasting before we even got to the front desk to check-in. When we checked in with Michael at the front desk, he upgraded our room when he found out we were celebrating our anniversary. Tomo refilled our glasses with sake and invited us to take our glasses with us to our room. Later that evening, Michael delivered more of the yummy sake and some delightful, tasty snacks as a nice anniversary treat. I jumped in for an enjoyable soak in the wonderful tub--the sake was a great complement to the bath! Then we enjoyed the lights of San Francisco in our corner room. The room was nicely furnished, and the Lather bath products were a nice touch. In the morn, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise sneaking over the buildings on the horizon. We had the weekend planned and took Michael up on his offer to help us with anything we needed--we wanted to take a bottle of the yummy sake home with us. Michael got us a bottle. We would highly recommend Hotel Kabuki. The price was right, the room was great, and the staff was awesome. Parking was good for a large city: we parked in the underground lot next to the hotel--very easy access and out of the continuous rain. We didn't spend near enough time in the hotel. And, we didn't take time to enjoy the Kabuki Spa, which we heard was great. Guess we'll have to plan that on our next visit to SanFrancisco--and we'll definitely stay at Hotel Kabuki!"
148,2085,"Feb 9 2008 	Great value lux-light hotel	My husband and I stayed at the KH for 11 days, combining business and pleasure. We requested an Executive Suite which was overall an outstanding value, very large and comfortable for a long stay. We had requested a quiet location, which was honored. While the executive suites are lovely and comfortable, the lighting is not ideal for actually working in the room as the lamps provided are quite dim. However, there is a lovely desk with a comfortable office chair, copious/convenient electrical outlets and free WIFI which was seamless. There is also an in-room safe which accomodates laptops. The added bonus of this room is the sauna in the bathroom.Constructive criticisms: the inconsistent housekeeping, particularly noticeable over the weekend. The room itself was always cleaned, but removal of dirty glasses was variable, we had to request wineglasses daily from the front desk, outside carpet needed vacuuming. The front desk staff was extremely responsive and should be commended on their customer service approach. The restaurant is a joke compared to the copious other excellent options in the immediate area. For those not familiar with SF, this hotel is not in the &quot;thick of things&quot; of San Francisco but in Japantown which we actually wanted. For breakfast, head up Filmore (4 blocks away) to one of the boulangeries. Overall a great stay, not the Peninsula, but an outstanding value and wonderful customer service. Just skip the restaurant."
149,2085,"Feb 3 2008	Great Hotel!!	Wow. A great hotel! Hospitality was great and very accommodating. The access to the Miyako mall and Japan town is great (didn't even have to get wet). The king suites are very spacious and the Japanese style baths are great for soaking in. When we arrived, they had us in a western style room (which was still very spacious) but we wanted a Japanese style room. The front desk fixed it in a flash and gave a new room. The king bed was a sleep number and very comfortable and the linens were soft. The bath even had a small sauna (which was great for drying wet clothes after it rained). The downsides of the place is the difficulty to get a taxi and how far it is from other attractions in the city. But its still only a $7-$10 taxi ride to anywhere you would want to go (straight down Post street). Public Transportation is also convenient. But if you enjoy the Nissei culture, then this is the place to stay!"
150,2085,"Feb 1 2008 	Fabulous Stay at the Kabuki!	My husband and I just came back from a 5 night stay at the Kabuki. It was the most wonderful hotel we have ever stayed in. We have stayed in other nice hotels in San Francisco and other cities but this one was the best. The staff were ever so courteous and accommodating. At first we were given a smaller King bedroom on the 16th floor which was quite nice but was not what we had booked (we had booked the larger renovated King corner room that had a sitting area and 2 glass doors/windows with balcony). When we brought this to their attention, they immediately moved us to the 15th floor corner King room and offered to move our belongings. I am not sure why there was a mix up but they took care of it promptly and graciously. Both rooms were clean and well taken care of and have a nice Japanese decor. The spaciousness and comfort of the sitting area with chaise lounge, chair and glass coffee table was a welcome treat after walking the streets of S.F. The deep japanese tub soothed our muscles and mind--no need for a hot tub spa! I especially loved opening the soji screens in the morning to look out over the city and mountains. It is also pretty at night with the city lights. Having a covered though narrow balcony to step out on to feel the fresh air was nice too even when it was raining. The housekeeping was exceptional.  Further staff accommodation/kindness: One evening we inquired about where to buy a bottle of wine. When the front desk staff said it would be quite a walk and it was raining, they then produced a bottle for us, no charge! Only 3 minor areas would enhance the room: 1. Put a sliding door to close off the bathroom 2. Have a chest of drawers for clothing 3. Offer black and green tea with the in-room coffee set up. Check specials as prices can vary. Our cost was $125 but 2 weeks later I saw that it was $179. It would have been worth it for that room but also would have been beyond our budget."
151,2085,"Jan 29 2008	Nice place	My wife and I live in the Bay Area and wanted to get away for a couple of nights alone (no kids). My wife insisted that wherever we stayed, it had to have a good sized tub. I think all of the rooms here have deep Japanese soaking tubs, so she was pleased. The bed was quite comfortable.I agree with most of the other reviews, the rooms are on the small size, but that is standard for SF. The staff is really terrific and the restaurant was soooo nice. It was my bday, so they comped us on the entire dessert bill, including drinks! The other nice feature is that it's attached to the Japan Town Mall, which is totally enclosed and has a nice selection of restaurants to choose from."
152,2085,"Jan 17 2008	Heavenly Kimono Robes	I stayed in a corner room on the 16th floor. The room was extra large compared with most San Francisco properties. The decor was a very nice blend of Japanese traditional with contemporary touches. Shoji screens to cover the floor-to-ceiling windows, a small but lovely balcony, japanese soaking tub, chaise for relaxing and reading, plasma television, IPOD docking station and a heavenly Spa robe made my stay extraordinary. The bathroom has a separate vanity with granite counters and lots of space for toiletries, the towels are soft and wonderful and the commode is totally separate from the traditional Japanese bathing area. Tall people may find the shower experience a bit problematic. I am 5.4 and the showerhead was only one inch away from the crown of my head. The floors in the room were covered with carpet designed to mimic tatami mats, the closets are large and feature a safe and a refrigerator. Don't count on the coffee and tea buttler as it is stocked with Folgers instant coffee and Lipton tea (No fun!). The beds are dressed with high count egyptian cotton linens and a super soft down comforter. I was not a fan of their pillows. Too thick for my taste. As for the public areas. This hotel is in the heart of Japantown. The food is lovely, people are nice and the neighborhood is sooooo clean. The hotel is about 5 blocks away from the wonderful shops at Fillmore street. The hotel offers a daily wine and sake reception complimentary to guests. Avoid the fitness facility. It is small and it has not been updated. Instead go for a walk or a run."
153,2085,"Jan 17 2008	Being in Japan again	We visited Japan a couple of years ago and enjoyed staying at a hotel in the Hakone region. That hotel was geared to domestic Japanese tourists and we stayed in a tatami room. The tatami room at the Kabuki was fairly authentic except it didn't have the Toto toilet and it smelled musty. Like the hotel in Japan there were no lights by the futon bed on the floor so when I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I couldn't turn on a light until I got to the bathroom. Fortunately there was enough light from the lights outside on the street shining through the shoji screens for me to see.Guests are offered a tea service which was delivered to our room. I wanted a very light tea but it was served from an airpot where the tea had steeped too long so it was bitter.The employees were very courteous and helpful. When the TV remote didn't work, my husband called the front desk and an employee came promptly to our room and gave us a replacement."
154,2085,"Jan 13 2008 	Loved the Kabuiki	Exceptional service! The Kabuki is conveniently located and newly remodeled. Rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. The restaurant was surprisingly good for both breakfast and dinner. But what makes the property stand out is the truly exceptional service! Every single staff person we came in contact with was a delight - helpful, knowledgeable and very, VERY nice. This hotel has my strongest recommendation."
155,2085,"Jan 12 2008	Very Friendly Staff	Good remodel of the Miyako. Every staff member was exceedingly friendly. Room offered tight quarters between desk and bed, so may not be the best for heavy business. Hotel restaurant very good and plenty of room. Quiet area. Only noise came from loud door latching in hallways. Better soundproofing around doors would help. Taxis have to be called as there are none that wait there. Eat at Florios - 5 blocks away for great food."
156,2085,"Jan 12 2008 	Hotel restaurant is the best	Ate breakfast &amp; dinner at the hotel restaurant, the O Izekaya Lounge &amp; everything was just an awersome experience.Food was great &amp; also the service from the staff."
157,2085,"Jan 11 2008 	Pretty nice	My husband and I just got back from a 6-night stay at Hotel Kabuki, and for the most part, enjoyed our stay. We reserved and were presented with a renovated deluxe king room, only to be disappointed! Although it was on the 16th floor, our room was tiny and a bit outdated. The room was very clean, but smelled of smoke. The bed wasn't a king, and the view from the room was very average. The staff was nice enough to relocate us. We settled for the same type of room on the other side of the floor, which was slightly larger and had a king-sized bed. The view into the city was spectacular. Although the walls were paper thin, we found the 16th floor to be very quiet.We LOVED our soaking tub, our cozy bed, the free internet, and the festive decor. We also appreciated the wine hour, the great martinis in the bar, the front desk, and literally being in Japantown. We highly recommend parking underground for half the cost of valet, and reserving a room as high up as possible for a good night's sleep. The front desk even gave us a half bottle of cabernet for no reason-what a nice touch! We always found our room as neat as a pin when returning back in the afternoon.We did NOT like the lack of storage space in the room (where to put clothes?), nor the desk and chair being inches away from the bed-I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room when my husband was working at the desk. We also did not appreciate the inappropriate conversation made by the bellman upon arrival. We were not given the tea service as promised, but maybe they were too busy? Being that the rooms are so tiny, we would probably opt for a corner room if we were to return.Overall, we felt that our stay was a great value, yet presented some awkward moments. The staff does make a valiant effort to accommodate the guests, and we left very content with our experience."
158,2085,"Jan 10 2008 	excellent-- If you can sleep through intermittent thunderous traffic	My room was pleasant, extremely clean, and I really liked the comfortable bed and the selection of pillows. The Japanese touches in the room, especially the bathroom, were fun. The staff was efficient and friendly and the location was good. The room rates were reasonable and the free Internet was a nice perk. BUT-- my room, for five nights, faced Post street. Every few minutes, I could hear loud thunderous roar caused by trucks straining their way uphill. The noise was especially bothersome after 5 in the morning. I don't understand why they haven't installed soundproof windows. The loud noises marred an otherwise wonderful stay.There is a restaurant inside that seemed to be good but I didn't have a chance to eat there. There is also an exercise room. If you can handle public transportation (why not, this is San Francisco), buses costing $1.50 run up and down Geary very frequently (right behind the hotel). So you can avoid taking taxis for many simple trips, especially during working hours.A variety of fine and not-so-fine Japanese and Asian restaurants are nearby. But no Starbucks or similar cafe was visible within walking distance. It was amusing to see a Denny's in Japantown, two blocks from the hotel. On the last day, I noticed a Peet's Coffee sign in themovie theater window a couple of blocks away.Aside from the disturbing intermittent traffic noise, Hotel Kabuki seemed to be a fine place. I would definitely stay there again if they renovate their windows (or if I can get some efficient earplugs)."
159,2085,Jan 9 2008	not a good room experience	Did not like the room i got. Payed $199 dollars for it. Received a corner room. Only 6 inches of room to get inside the room because a bed dresser was in the entrance way next to the bed. the bed was facing the window. Bad feng shui for chinese people. Bathroom was good. But terrible room layout. I couldnt get my luggage through the entrance that i had to pick it up so i wouldnt hit the dresser with my luggage. I will never sleep at this place again especially at a rate i paid. I should of just stayed at Clarion near the airport where i've stayed before and paid half the price and received a larger room. Customer service was okay. Nothing special.
160,2085,"Jan 9 2008 	Excellent place to stay	This hotel was an excellent place to stay for a couple that wasn't interested in being in the thick of the tourist destinations.The location was ideal as it was fairly centrally located. We were able to walk to several lively little areas with good restaurants, movies, and shopping. We felt like we were really experiencing the city through the eyes of the locals. At the same time, the proximity to the Geary bus line made it quite easy to go West towards the ocean and Golden Gate Park, or East towards downtown.The room was clean and nicely decorated in minimal Japanese style. We had an amazing view over Japantown and could even see the tip of the Golden Gate from our corner balcony on the 14th floor (SW corner). I highly suggest getting a room with a soaking tub. It was a rejuvenating luxury after our long days of exploring the surrounding areas. Our room also had an ipod dock, which was a pleasant surprise.The only downer was that we had planned to use our complementary pass to the nearby Kabuki Springs &amp; Spa as a couple. It just so happened that they were closed the one day of the week (Tuesday) that was coed because it was a holiday. We plan to stay at this hotel again and again!"
161,2085,"Jan 7 2008 	Yes you should stay here!	This was the second time we stayed at this hotel within the year, and would not hesitate to come back again. Perfect location for Japantown, and convenient for the rest of the city, too, without being downtown in all that craziness. Convenient shopping and parking.Wonderful beds!!! Clean rooms, in traditional styling. Love the deep soaking tubs! The only improvement I would recommend would be to add a sliding wood panel door between bedroom and bath, for privacy (in bathing area) and so that turning on bathroom light at night doesn't disturb those sleeping.Best of all, this hotel is across the street from &quot;Bushi-tei&quot;, a fabulous (1 Michelin Star) Asian-French fusion restaurant, that is an incredible dining experience!"
162,2085,"Jan 6 2008 	New upgrades make the Kabuki even better!	I recently stayed at the Hotel Kabuki, formerly known as the Miyako Hotel, and was happy to see that the new upgrades had made the hotel even more attractive than before. I booked a corner king room with a deep Japanese tub. This time I was only on the 4th floor, so didn't have much of a view, but the room had big windows and a comfortable bed.  Included in my room package (booked at the hotel's website, jdv.com) was a $20 coupon for O-Izakaya, the newly-opened restaurant on the 1st floor, where I sampled high grade sake and small dishes of Japanese fusion cuisine. I followed the suggestions of my knowledgeable waiter, and ordered a wonderful scallop dish, and an interesting Japanese mini-donut dessert. The dishes are small and meant to be shared, so don't go here if you are ravenous and have a small pocketbook. I visited my usual spots, including Kinokuniya Bookstore, the Paper Tree Origami Shop and the Japanese dollar store by the hotel above the bank. The hotel is conveniently located smack dab in the middle of Japantown, and is near most major tourist attractions.I always enjoy the deep Japanese bath, but was puzzled to see that the shower just outside of the tub had been removed, making it difficult to wash before getting into the soaking tub. Just a small quibble for an otherwise perfect visit."
163,2085,"Jan 2 2008	Joie de Vivre Hotel was a joy	A friend had described a recent stay in SF that sounded delightful so I checked in to her suggestion. We did not choose that one, but it was part of the Joie de Vivre Hotels chain. As I looked at other options they had to offer, I became interested in the Hotel Kabuki .We were looking for something a bit different in San Francisco at Christmas--NOT drowning in Christmas decor--and a Japanese themed hotel seemed like the ticket. Then, the location turned out to be central. We loved it. Went everywhere on buses or walked. Staff could not have been nicer. Rooms very nicely appointed and I thought the rate was a bargain. Our view was fantastic. We booked a couple of nights for othere family members and they were equally impressed. A small problem did arise, but it was far overshadowed by how well it was handled. I will definitely look to Joie de Vivre Hotels for future visits to CA."
164,2085,"Jan 2 2008 	Nice room good housekeeping no Internet	We stayed at the Kabuki the weekend before Christmas. We booked the &quot;executive sauna suite&quot; at what we considered a very reasonable price. We love the location of the hotel right next to the Japantown mall.The room was beautiful, modern, and spacious, with comfortable furniture. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in and it didn't bounce around like a lot of hotel beds, so I could turn over at night without disturbing my partner. My partner liked the sauna. The living area and sleeping area are separated by a translucent screen, which is what might be expected of a Japanese style room but isn't what we were hoping for, because one of us likes to go to sleep early in a dark room and the other likes to stay up late with a light on.The bathtub wasn't quite what I was expecting (it was similar to a typical Western bathtub, but the sides were a bit taller, and there was no bathing area outside the tub). My partner asked to see a room with a soaking tub setup, but the room was a lot smaller than what we had, so we didn't move.The hotel advertises free wireless Internet, but it rarely worked in our room. No wired Internet was available as far as I could tell. We didn't get the advertised &quot;welcome tea service&quot;. That was OK with us.We had good service from the housekeeping staff. One day we asked them to clean our room right away because we were leaving and coming back shortly. They did. Another day we didn't want any housekeeping, so we left the Do Not Disturb sign up all day, and they honored itthey just left a card saying &quot;If you want housekeeping, phone.&quot; (These days most hotels will bug you even if you leave the sign out.) My partner had trouble hooking his laptop up to the TV, and they reasonably promptly sent a service person up who helped figure it out.We had some minor issues with bell service. A bell person was not available when we arrived. We had loaded our own luggage onto a cart and were heading to our room when one appeared and followed us to our room, perhaps hoping to get a tip for not actually doing anything. We had planned to use valet parking, and we used it for a couple of hours on our first day there, but after we got back for the evening, the lot was full and we were directed to self park in the Japantown lot. Not so terrible, it turned out - the Japantown lot is cheaper anyway (which we knew), and has parking directly under the hotel (which we didn't know). We didn't get charged for the few hours of valet parking we had.Maybe I'm behind the times, but I expect the staff of a hotel of this class to be willing to call a taxi when requested. My expectations were not met. The first time we requested a taxi, the bell person got us one but acted like he was doing us a big favor. The second time, he said it would take less time if we went out to the taxi stand in front of the hotel and hailed a taxi ourselves. That was a bit uncomfortable because one of us is mobility impaired and we had to stand there for a while.We ate at the hotel restaurant twice for breakfast. The coffee was good and promptly refilled. The food was OK-to-good. One time we had to wait a long time for a table even though the restaurant was almost empty."
165,2085,"Jan 1 2008	Japanese Bliss-American style	We really enjoyed our family (2 adults, 2 children) stay at the Kabuki hotel. It is centrally located and we were able to get around the city easily. The hotel is connected to a mall with inexpensive food items----an array of Japanese food and there is dining at the hotel as well. Spent time in the small but empty fitness room and very much enjoyed the Japanese soaking tub in the room. Hotel guests receive one free pass to the Kabuki spring/spa bath house but book spa treatments well in advance!!!!!!-I was unable to book any treatments during my stay.Would stay again...the rooms were clean and stylish and the daily wine tasting cocktail hour was a lovely touch.The room was a little small for 4 but I was told it might be tight. Next time, we will book the family suite off the garden."
166,2085,"Dec 31 2007 	Mixed bag	While it's location and price are reasonable, I had anmixed experience at this hotel. My boyfriend and I booked this hotel as a romantic weekend getaway. The Joie de Vivre addition was obviously still in the awkward &quot;teenage&quot; years of a &quot;redo&quot;. The lobby was wonderfully Zen in its decor. We paid for a King bed with a &quot;balcony&quot; and a &quot;view of the city&quot;. I was less than impressed with what the reality was. The &quot;balcony&quot; was a concrete slab and wall that extended less than a foot from the room and connected with the next room over (no privacy). It looked less than &quot;updated&quot;. The view wasn't bad...a generic city view... nothing to write home about. And while the room we booked, and most of the rooms at the Kabuki tout their &quot;traditional Japanese soaking tubs&quot;... they were laughable. If you weigh over 140 pounds (like me), fitting into one of these tubs is a tough sell. The shower head was broken and the shower door was not sealed (so water got everywhere on the floor). The pouring bucket proved to be more useful than the shower head. As for the hotel staff, I would say they were giving about 50%. Every time I called downstairs for a taxi it took 10-20 rings for them to pick up. When my boyfriend called from the airport it took 18 rings for them to pick up- which was more than frustrating. When we finally got hold of them, they were very helpful in giving direction and restaurant advice. The beds and bedding were the most impressive thing about the whole experience. They were perfect. The room was very small, there was barely enough room to move around it. There were no curtains per se, just sliding wooden panels (which did not do a good job of keeping out the morning sunlight). A few things to keep in mind, before you arrive, bring earplugs (it's a noisy part of town) and bring your own room service (as they haven't gotten to that part of the renovations yet)."
167,2085,"Dec 31 2007	Zen in Kabuki	Our family always stays here when we go to SF, and for good reason. Kabuki creates a great hotel experience, down to the details: hot tea served in a cast-iron kettle, a wonderful unique square tub, patios with views of the city which open by sliding the wooden doors that have beautiful Japanese paintings (..now that was a long sentence!) And during off-season, you can find some great room rates. Highly recommended."
168,2085,"Dec 26 2007 	Great Price/Performance	This was probably the sixth or seventh time my wife and I have stayed at this hotel in the last year and a half. so obviously we are quite comfortable here. However, this is the first time we have stayed since the completion of the recent renovation, and I can say that it really makes a difference. There are still some niggly issues with small details, but the overall experience is extremely positive. The pluses are as follows:1. The rooms are spacious - we have always stayed in corner rooms.2. The bathrooms are in general spacious, and the new arrangement is quite appealing.3. The new room furniture is far more contemporary than the old furniture - now there are flat screen TVs, and the everything is updated.4. The linens - both bath and bed - have been significantly upgraded and can hold their own with any top level hotel.5. We ate at the completely redone Japanese restaurant and had an excellent meal. The waiter knew the menu inside and out. His recommendations hit the spot. The best dishes were dirt cheap.6. This is probably the best hotel to stay in San Francisco, if you have a car and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for parking. We were able to self park within 100 feet of the room elevators at a cost of $15/night. We were within a mile of downtown without any of the traffic. There was never a wait to get in or out of the lot or any problem of finding a parking space regardless of time of day. Having spent $51/day at the Mark for parking in the past, this is an absolute bargain. Plus it's centrally located7. As usual, the staff was very friendly.So what are the negatives?1. The Kabuki is not the Four Seasons - the total luxury of a world class hotel is not here - but then neither are the room rates.2. One day our room was not made up until early evening. This was a minor pain, but it should not have happened.3. The rooms could have more lighting.4. The new furniture has less drawer space than the old. This only matters if you are traveling for an extended period of time, which we are frequently doing.All and all, the Kabuki offers a great price/performance package, so the minor negatives are vastly outweighed by the overall positives cited above."
169,2085,"Dec 24 2007 	Loved the Kabuki Hotel	My husband and I needed a hotel room for only one night and chose the Kabuki Hotel. The hotel was wonderful and the staff very accommodating. We were generously greeted upon check-in with complimentary sake and/or wine which was a lovely touch. Our room was gorgeous and we treated ourselves to the Japanese bath treatment (ofuro) provided in our room complete with step by step instructions. We felt transported in time and country. The attention to detail in the room and the atttentive staff made our stay truly memorable and we wished we'd had time to stay additional nights. Though the hotel was under renovation, we were not inconvenienced in any way."
170,2085,"Dec 11 2007 	Rip-off bar but good hotel	The room was great, the service was very good but I was hugely disappointed with the bar. The hotel has directions to a bar in the lobby and the bar we were lead to was a stupid Karaoke Bar. We stayed for 2 drinks each and we were charged 50 euros for 4 drinks altogether- an absolute rip-off!!!!!! I blame the hotel for that, even though the bar can be accessed through the hotel into a small shopping complex. We were charged for listening to the japanese singers who were useless, just cause we wanted a few drinks without wanting to go down the street. This was the so-called hotel bar as such. It sort of ruined the goodness of the hotel."
171,2085,"Dec 11 2007 	Could be a great hotel but...	I thought this hotel would be much better based on the reviews. It's true that the lobby is spotless and when you're there it seems like it will be a great stay, but it seems like they gave, like, 75% effort on our stay. Some of the disappointments were:1. No ice bucket. Had to call downstairs and wait 15 minutes for one to be brought up. (Isn't there a checklist of some kind for the housekeeping staff?)2. Broken shower bracket meant I had to hold the shower thing by the handle the whole time. An almost relaxing shower.3. Sliding glass doors to balcony is shared with the room next door. Before you jump out of bed, swing the curtains open and say &quot;Good Morining San Francisco!&quot; be sure to check the folks from the room next door aren't looking into your room. Also, the balcony sliding doors where unlocked when we arrived which means if we hadn't checked, we'd have left all our stuff in there totally accessible by the next door neigbors via the shared balcony.4. Bare wall patch where they had done some repairs in our room, but not repaired enought to paint or paper over. Oh yea, very Zen spackle job there.5. Security Risk - although there is a sign when entering the hotel through the totally Public parking garage in the basement saying someone will have to buzz you into the hotel... we just parked, opened the door to the hotel and took the elevator directly to the 10th floor and our room! How can you ever trust a knock on the door for &quot;room service&quot; after that kind of a security hole in a major city?Anyway, this is a nice location and the lobby and decorating hint at superb service, but it's like the management is alseep at the switch, so you get good service only when a particular staff member feels like it... 75% of the time."
172,2085,"Dec 4 2007 	Weekend Getaway	Hotel Kabuki is the newly renovated version of one of my old standbys, Hotel Miyako. Now managed by the Joie de Vivre chain, Hotel Kabuki is a sleeker rendition of its former self. I loved the new decor. More, I loved the personal attention. Although the hotel is still rolling out its services, I like the idea of being welcomed soon after check-in by a tea cart with your choice of teas. The service was not available when we checked in, but we were the first to try the bath butler services. The assistant manager went out of her way to make the experience special by fulfilling my request for hot sake. Members of the Joie de Vivre Club receive a room upgrade, and we were provided with a suite for the weekend. This is not the fanciest hotel in San Francisco, but I think good service trumps almost everything else when it comes to a great hotel stay. I really appreciate that no one knocked on our door at 8:00 a.m. to hurry us out so the room could be cleaned. There were some rough spots, like we were missing some towels, but the hotel is still shaking out. I look forward to returning."
173,2085,"Nov 30 2007	Zen-like stay	We chose Hotel Kabuki for a two-night celebration of our anniversary because we love the Joie de Vivre hotel chain. Hotel Kabuki was yet another wonderful stay for us. We loved the quiet, Zen-like atmosphere of our room, the art-filled lobby, wine-reception, and wonderfully attentive staff. Our Japanese deep-soaking tub simply added to the atmosphere and our first evening was capped by an absolutely amazing dinner in their newly opened restaurant. The server, manager and chef were attentivethe food fantastic and all of it sustainably farmed, grown or fished. All of this located conveniently in Japantown near Fillmore Street. Fantastic value! We cant wait to return!"
174,2085,Nov 29 2007 	A Nice Hotel	I chose the Hotel Kabuki because we were seeing a concert at The Fillmore and wanted to be within walking distance of the venue. I made reservations through the hotel website. We arrived around 5pm. Weparked in the Japan Center Garage which has an entrance to the hotel. The cost was $15 for an 8-24 hour period. Which is not bad for SF. We chose to park here instead of trying the hotel parking after reading reviews. We saved ourselves time and frustation as the hotel parking lot is truly a small parking lot (appx. 20 cars). Check-in was smooth and quick. We even received a complimentary room upgrade. The recent renovation could be seen throughout the hotel. Thelobby was beautiful and the room was great. The Japanese motif throughout the hotel has a very calming effect. After checking in we headed out to find the venue and some dinner. TheFillmore is about 5 blocks away. We were very comfortable walking around the area. We ate a Korean restaurant nearby the venue. It was quite good (but I've forgotten the name). We had time after dinner to walk around before the start of the show. There is a little mall near the hotel which has quite a few restaurants in it. We were disappointed we didn't think of walking through there first as there were quite a few restaurants we were interested in eating at. The bed was extremely comfortable. So much so that I didn't want to get up in the morning. And the bath/shower was wonderful. We received complimentary passes to the public bath but were unable to use them since we were only there for the night. Hopefully next time. We had an ejoyable stay and look forward to staying there again.
175,2085,"Nov 23 2007 	Peaceful Oasis	Newly renovated (Nov 1, 2007), this hotel has a calm adn restful Japanese decor. The new Lounge is wonderful, great sake and food selections. Safe place, and living in japan town was a great experience. Taxi's are available easily, and so is public transpotation, although I did not use one. The staff is very friendly and helpful."
176,2085,"Nov 21 2007 	Renovated Bliss	We would only stay at the former Miyako Hotel while in The City. The renovation and renaming to Hotel Kabuki continued the great accomodations. With a central location, loads of parking (which is at a premium in San Francisco) and a newly renovated room, the Hotel Kabuki will continue to be our prime hotel in The City. Also got to try a Sleep Number bed that the original Bionic Woman espouses on those infommercials."
177,2085,"Nov 12 2007 	Patience rewarded with a serene performance	A fabulous renovation is under way at the former Hotel Miyako in the Japan Center, SF. It is now known as The Kabuki Hotel and operated by the Joie de Vivre boutique hotel group. The staff could not have been friendlier and more helpful. We were upgraded to a suite the night we checked in. We had reserved a JdV online special King view room with Japanese soaking tub. Unfortunately our upgrade was to a partially renovated suite, not in the view tower. The room was a weird combination of a tatami-room bedroom (bed on the floor) and a western-style bed in a room separated by shoji screens. The bathroom was a little odd, it had a flip down bathroom scale!? The brand new flat screen tv was not visible from the beds, or any other piece of furniture in the room for that matter. After some rearranging, one of us was able to watch tv comfortably. The (western) king size bed was comfortable, the room quiet and we had a great night's sleep. I'm sure this is going to be a very nice room when the renovation is complete. The next morning I called the front desk and we were given the room we had originally reserved with no fuss. THAT room was fantastic, completely renovated in beautiful, soothing colors and relaxing textures. We had a view to the east looking at downtown SF. It was a very comfortable and elegant room, full of special touches, such as an obi decorating the top of the bed covers, Japanese pottery and sliding screens decorated with a Japanese Lord and Lady. The Japan Town neighborhood is lively and full of wonderful places to eat, fun shopping at Ichi Ban Kan (the Japanese dollar store) and other more traditional Asian stores in the center. It is also within walking distance of the Filmore shopping district with again, great eating, drinking and fun shops to explore. This is a great alternative to the noise and bustle of Union Square. Discover a different San Francisco neighborhood!"
178,2085,"Nov 11 2007 	Comfortable stay nice amenities at the Hotel Kabuki	I just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Kabuki. The hotel was convenient to lovely restaurants in the Japantown area, as well as close to the Filmore district for shopping and more lovely restaurants. The bed was comfortable with soft pillows, and a nice treat was the japanese style bath with deep soaking tub. I was there for a conference, the conference facilities were nice, as was the catering. I especially appreciated the free wireless internet access and the business center."
179,2085,"Nov 8 2007	Wonderful hotel!	Hotel Kabuki has a wonderful, peaceful ambience and an attentive, friendly staff. I would love to stay there every time I go to San Francisco!"
180,2085,"Nov 8 2007 	problematic stay!	Having just undergone rennovation there was no room service, no mini bar and alarms that went off in the night. The restaurant is currently closed. The neighborhood closes early and by 8pm there is no local convenience store, you need a cab to get a soda!"
181,2085,"Oct 30 2007 	Great Hotel	Rooms were as promised, beds comfortable. Parking limited but public parking is below building &amp; $15 per night, no in/out. You can usually park at the Hotel during the day and when you come in for the night - park in the public garage..Cash only."

198,2085,Oct 16 2008 	?????????????????
1,2087,Oct 26 2009 	GReat place for the price	This was a nice hotel with some charm. The rooms and hallways look a little like they're from the 1800s. The rooms were snug but comfortable. Make sure you don't get a room on the street side because it's very noisy. We asked for a quieter room and they obliged. The neighborhood was close the Powell st street station and union sq parkk which are big hubs of activity. At the same time there were definitely some seedy characters and some (male) strip clubs around.
2,2087,"Oct 22 2009 	Hell Is Better Than This Place - Do Yourself A Favor And Never Come Here	This was the WORST hotel stay I have ever had! It is comparable to staying in a parking lot- all you hear is horns, CAR ALARMS, even people having sex next door ALL NIGHT. It is as if they are in your room! You will be up through out the entire night - NO SLEEP. And at night there is no manager, so if you call for help, you essentially get NO help. The front guy during the night time claims to have power, but he will just holler at the customers and then says that he is not the manager. Why is he there? Why is he there at all? The people who work there are so incredibly rude with no willingness whatsoever to assist. Do yourself a favor and don't ever, ever come here!!!"
3,2087,"Oct 9 2009	Great value for money	Very convenient location, front desk staff very helpful, we needed to leave our backpacks for a few hours and they were happy to oblige. Older hotel, but very clean. Bathroom and bed linen was spotless. When our hairdryer stopped working and a globe blew in the lamp it was fixed promptly. True there was not much natural light in the room( maybe there was more in others) but you can get sunshine when you are outside enjoying the sights. Yes, it is near the Glide Methodist Church and its services for the homeless, but we (myself and 13 yr old daughter) did not find this a problem. They did not bother us at all. The hotel was close to public transit, restaurants. The only downside was the only computer they had was very slow. There is an internet place close by though. All in all a really good value stay for San Francisco."
4,2087,Oct 8 2009 	Nice Quaint Hotel	The Mark Twain was what I was expecting. The rooms were small but had nice furnishings. The bath was small but the room and bath were very clean. The only minus I saw was it was a bit too much noise outside the building. We were on the back side which is not as loud as the front of the hotel..For the money it was a great value. Staff was very helpful.
5,2087,"Oct 8 2009 	Bare Bones in downtown SF	Hotel was older, but quite charming. Had an &quot;old Hollywood&quot; feel, with the rich, classic lobby decor and attention to detail. The rooms were comfortable and clean, staff were friendly. Our room was on the second floor over the street, so if noise is an issue for you, ask for a different room. The hotel must be by the precinct because there were emergency vehicles zooming by all night long. Other than the noise it was a nice stay. Convenient location for a night out in downtown San Francisco."
6,2087,"Oct 7 2009 	Hip Boutique Hotel ????	The Hotel Mark Twain is not a 3 Star Hotel! Reading the description and Star Rating on Hotwire lead me to believe this was going to be one of the nicer boutique hotels in the Union Square area. I thought I was getting another GREAT deal from Hotwire based on the price. I was WRONG! A &quot;No Frills&quot; Boutique hotel (if that really exists) is the best way to classify the Hotel Mark Twain.We stayed one night at the Hotel Mark Twain before driving up to Napa/Sonoma. The lobby has contemporary dcor but the rest of the property doesnt adhere to the same hip standards. This hotel reminded me of a place I would stay as a college student. The room was clean and adequate. The location of the hotel is convenient (close to restaurants, shopping and public transportation), however, the homeless and other sketchy characters around this area might put off true tourists. Just like in most metropolitan areas, the socioeconomic demographics change quite drastically within a two block walk or drive away from the hotel.The elevator is very SLOW and can bearly fit 4 adults with luggage! If youre a light sleeper this hotel is not a place for you. Loud traffic, horns and sirens were constant throughout the entire night. The rooms do not have A/C! The valet parking is $25/day plus tax and it takes a long time to get your car. The hotel staff was very nice and courteous! The breakfast restaurant next to hotel was great!"
7,2087,"Oct 5 2009 	Mark Twain Hotel - Can't Complain Generally Good.	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two days in September 2009, whilst exploring San Francisco. On the whole it was good, the room itself was on the forth floor, it was a little dark as there was not much natural light in the room. The beds and washroom were fine, and the room itself was perfectly acceptable and clean as well as a good decor. The shower was hot , the TV worked well and it is located at the bottom end of Taylor Street, which is a little out of the centre of things, but walk able to China Town, but a taxi to the main Fishermans Wharf. We went to Alcatraz and did the usual tours of the Wharf, Pier 39, Golden Gate Bridge so great for that. A big downer is that the parking is all valet, and you have to pay 25 USD per day, plus the mandatory taxes, which makes it quite expensive. I am not blaming the Mark Twain Hotel, as this is the case with all the hotels. The main shopping square is close, and the Irish bar is great, even though it's expensive. If you are walking, the hills are a killer, but you cant get away from that. So as far as the Mark Twain is concerned all round a very pleasant stay for the two days we were there, but dont turn right down the hill, as we were told this is the dodgy area, where all the weird people of SF hang out, so basically we turned left and walked up the hill."
8,2087,"Sep 30 2009 	Good basic hotel very centrally located no frills.	This hotel is a great place to be based out of. Very centrally located, steps from the MUNI and BART, and cable cars. The rooms are very clean, very basic, ceiling fan, heating, nice bathroom, simple amenities. If you go to this place expecting a very clean motel-like room, with excellent staff = thats what you receive. If you want a 5-star hotel, look somewhere else. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and kind. I got my wake up calls on time, and received my faxes/fedexes on time. Everything else was good. Id stay here again, but I probably wouldnt honeymoon here. Recommended!"
9,2087,"Sep 25 2009	Great value and location for visitors to San Francisco	I stayed here with my Mother for 4 nights in September and got a room with two beds for a very good price through hotwire. Considering the price I was really impressed with how nice the hotel is. The room was clean, the towels were nice, the staff were helpful and friendly. As others have pointed out, the elevator is small and slow and the rooms are small. However they are not &quot;tiny&quot; by any means. Noise can be an issue as we could hear our neighbors arguing in the morning. It helped to close our bathroom door as a lot of the noise was coming through their bathroom to our bathroom.I've been to San Francisco before and have friends who live there and the neighborhood is as safe as any urban/city center. Would I let my mother walk by herself late at night in the neighborhood? NO, but she has lived in suburbs her whole life. However I felt perfectly safe walking with her. Being very close to Union Square there are LOTS of people around at night. It is only very late at night, say past midnight, that the streets empty out.While you will see homeless people, they are not aggressive like in some other cities. If you are someone like my mother who has lived most of her life in a leafy suburbs, then this is NOT the hotel for you...but if you have traveled at all or have lived in a city, do not be frightened by the other reviews. With in two blocks of this hotel are some VERY upscale hotels, the neighborhood is fine as long as you don't go stumbling around drunk at 2 am!There is an excellent Indian/Pakistani restaurant near the hotel called Punjab. My mother claimed it was as authentic as she has seen any South Asian restaurant in America AND the price is very reasonable!Bottom line, for what we paid this was an EXCELLENT bargain for a hotel right near Union Square and it is an ideal place for visitors to get sleep at night and spend the day out and about in the city! I would not hesitate to take my Mother there again."
10,2087,"Sep 20 2009 	Very dicey neighborhood and the hotel needs updating	I will say the staff was helpful, and it was close to Union Square as advertised. However, when walking to Union Square, there were a large group of homeless people, as there was some kind of a free clinic right there. I realize San Francisco has a lot of homeless, but this was more than average. The rooms were very small and needed updating. The bathroom was extremely tiny, and there was a cold air return in the shower right next to the showerhead, which was very strange. One night at 3 AM, we were awakened by yelling and loud talking, which sounded right next door. The elevator was miniscule and very slow. Most of the time we used the steps. We would never go back, that's for sure."
11,2087,"Sep 16 2009 	Nice and Handy	Stayed here for two nights, staff very friendly. The room we had was on the main street and was very noisy with sirens and the homeless yelling most of the night. Very clean and convenient to shops and transport, Internet cafe two doors up very handy. We found the heater worked one night but not the next. Really enjoyed our stay, would stay there again but would ask for a room not on the main street. It was an enjoyable stay and recommend it, price was good too."
12,2087,"Jun 25 2009 	don't go there	Our booking was through a second party as part of a package- the bed was comfortable, location we thought was good until - we had a room on the main street, the central heating was hot but we could not turn it off, we therefore opened the window - mistake, the street noise was loud, the homeless people yelled half the night along with the traffic noise made for a couple of sleepless nights. The room was small - the bathroom was made for a midget the door couldn't open fully. We did a city tour and the tour operator told us not to go out at night in the area as it was not safe. We really hate to give a bad review but there must be better places to stay in beautiful San Fransisco. We love the city!!! Service at the hotel was not bad, but was lacking. When we made a comment to reception his answer was &quot;it is an old hotel&quot;."
13,2087,"Jun 16 2009 	Nice little hotel....	We arrived around 11.30pm after 24hrs of travel from England. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was to the side of the hotel with two queen beds on the 4th floor. The room was ok, no complaints but the bathroom was tiny! You had to manoeuvre around the toilet to open and shut the door. We dropped our bags in our room and set off to find water (beer &amp; wine) for the fridge in our room. Flat screen tv with not too many channels though.We found a liquor store on the next corner, dropped the water back off at our room and went looking for a beer. Had a couple in a small bar, went back to the room, had some wine and then bed!We went for breakfast next door to the Taylor St Cafe. Special breakfast was $8.95 for eggs, bacon or sausage, toast and plenty of coffee refils. What surprised us was the fresh fruit salad served on the same plate as the eggs &amp; bacon! Unusual for us Brits but still good! We went here each morning for breakfast, having omlettes the other two mornings. Good value.We asked reception how long it would take to walk to Fishermans Wharf - he said about 30 mins and warned us it was hilly. Well we knew San Fran was hilly, but just how steep and hilly we hadn't realised! We walked the whole of Taylor St to the wharf. It was hard work for oldies like us! but the views were worth it. Walking down hill to the wharf was just as telling on the knees! We spent a couple hours at the wharf and ate lunch at one of the tiny cafes to the side of pier 49. We had excellent lobster, crab and shrimp for $16.95 each and I had the most delicious clam chowder. Then we took the hop on, hop off open top city bus tour. $35 each for a two day pass. Well worth it and we thoroughly enjoyed this. Put sun cream on tho, DH got his forhead burnt! We caught the cable car back to Powell St, $5.50 each, as our legs were so tired!We had a cocktail in the hotel bar before dinner. Quite pricey at $11 each, and we ate at Fish and Farm, (attached to the hotel) on Sat night. The prices given on the menu are inclusive of tax. ( In England they dont put tax on restaurant checks.) We shared a starter of smoked ham gnocci. DH had baked halibut and I had ribs. Sides are extra and we didnt realise this and so didnt order any. The meal came to $65 incl tax and gratuity. The meal was nice but we wouldnt rush back there.We had pre-booked a trip to Alcatraz for Sunday morning with www.alcatrazcruises.com. You are advised to pre-book, as trips are well booked up and you wont get one if you just turn up on the day. This cost $26 each, audio included. We caught the street car from Powell to Pier 33 and this cost $1.50 each -What value! This trip was well worth it and we spent about 2.5hrs on the island. We caught the ciity tour bus back to China Town (using our 2 day pass) and visited Union Square.Sun night we spent in an Irish bar. Turn left out of the hotel, then right (onto Geary or was it Ellis??) anyway about 300 yds down. Fun night. Monday morning we caught the BART at Powell to the airport, $5.35 each for our flight to Vegas. Lots cheaper than a taxi!We enjoyed our stay at Mark Twain and would recommend this hotel. We enjoyed our stay at Mark Twain and would recommend this hotel."
14,2087,"Jun 9 2009 	I'd Stay Again	There's some reviewers who've griped about the cleanliness and location. Look - it's an older building in an older part of town. If you prefer the sterility of the suburban motels, the MT is not for you. However, if you want clean and comfortable accommodations close to transportation and within walking distance of SF's key attractions, this is your place. The staff is very friendly and willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
15,2087,"Jun 5 2009	We could recommend this hotel absolutely	A perfect hotel to stay in the heart of SF. If you can, reservate a room in the backyard since the room to the street side are a little bit loud. Absolutely friendly and helpful staff and a charming hotel."
16,2087,"Mar 14 2009 	Loved this hotel - great location wonderful ambience and helpful friendly employees.	We loved our stay in this hotel! Everyone was so nice and helpful, making our trip very enjoyable. This was our first time in San Francisco and we chose this boutique hotel because of its location and because of its unique history. This is not a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; hotel. We stayed there for 6 nights and asked many questions about the city such as: what sites to see, how to get somewhere, what restaurants are good, etc. The employees were always friendly and accommodating - especially Gio and Gregory.I have only 1 tip: Be careful where you walk after dark. We walked everywhere and had no problems. Just be aware of your surroundings - as you should be in any city."
17,2087,"Feb 6 2009 	Great Stay at a great location	I stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights. It was an absolutely great location. When we landed at SFO Airport we tried to catch a cab but the ride would cost us $40-$50. We took the AirTrain to the BART it cost us $5.35 each for a 30 min. ride that left us 3 block from the hotel. (Get off on Powell St.) The BART was great, no traffic, clean cars, and comfortable seats. Once we got off there were police officers everywhere, so I asked them questions instead of the random people off the streets.When we got to Hotel Mark it was so far so good. . . . We booked the room the night before and didn't have any problem at the front desk. When we got to our room on the 3rd floor it was all good. The bed was clean and comfortable. . . .The coffee machine I was not in to, it looked a little dirty, there is a Starbucks everywhere, get coffee there. . . . The Closet was big and spacious but they only gave 5 hangers. . . . Flat screen tv was nice to have and they had decent channels watch (not that we were in the room that often). The mini fridge was good to have also (If you don't want to spend the money on drinks buy your own and keep them there). . . .There was a liquor store on just about every corner (not to sure if that was a good or bad thing but it worked in our favor lol) . One thing I didn't like was that this place didn't have air condition, we didn't need it during this time of the year because out side was very cool, but if we were here while it was hot we would have been f*cked. The heater made a little noise during the night, so if your a light sleeper stay away, you may have to turn the knob on the heater to turn up the heat if you need it. Ummmmmm the front desk was very helpful to find what to do in the area. The area that was pretty decent, except for the homeless people all over, it's not just the hotel's area, they are everywhere. The Cable car aka the trolly were bit expensive $11 dollar for an all day pass, but if you need to go to fisherman's wharf take the F Cable car on Powell st for $1.50 and they give something like a tranfer that you can use within 3 to 4 hour on any F and maybe the MUNI not to sure. Westfield mall was 3 blocks away. Tons to eat while your here ranging from all different prices."
18,2087,"Jan 14 2009 	not bad...	liked the hotel.... nothing special... but it was cheap for the area somethings to things to expect that i didnt:1) no a/c, but its san fran so you dont need it really2) worlds smallest elevator 3) worlds slowest elevatori asked for something high up in the hotel (trying to get a better view)... got the 8th floor... with a view of the building next door... you are better off on the lower floors so you dont have to use that elevator...all in all i liked the hotel... i wouldnt stay much more south thatn this place as the area starts to get sketchy real fast..."
19,2087,"Jan 8 2009 	Good base for operations	Myself and my boss stayed at the Hotel Mark Twain for a week between 14th - 20th December. We were attending the fall AGU conference being held in San Francisco at the Moscone center. The hotel itself is about 5/10 minutes walk from the Moscone center (depending on your walking speed) so it was in a pretty good location.It was booked through the travel office at work so we had no idea what the hotel itself was going to be like so I came on trip advisor and got a bit worried about the reviews talking about the area it was in. When we got there though it wasn't nearly as bad as has been made out, there were homeless people about but I encountered them more down near Market Street (and just past the Hilton which is on the corner!) so I think to mention them for a specific hotel is wrong, every hotel in the area has the same thing.The hotel itself is pleasant enough, the lobby was nicely presented and the food at the Fish and Farm (I forget the name) was really, really nice.Room wise I can't complain about the size because I was in a double room by myself so I had two double beds to choose from.The windows weren't that bad but I went when it was cold and wet and so I had no inclination to open them (especially since the view was of the inner quadrant of the building!) but the one thing I must mention is the radiators.They are the old victorian style radiators (considering the hotel is styled around then this is no surprise) which means that when the heating is on they are LOUD! There doesn't appear to be any way to fully turn them off either as even when I turned the knob fully off there was still noises coming from it. That said most of the time it is faint background noise rather than anything you really notice.The lift is rather small but it does it's job so that's all that's important as far as I am concerned. Shower in the bath was nice and strong and the towels etc... were all decent quality. So overall it was a good hotel for me simply because it was only ever going to be a base of operations with not that much time spent there apart from sleeping. Frankly that is what this sort of hotel is aimed for and it does it's job well."
20,2087,"Jan 4 2009 	Mixed experience	This hotel is situated in a safe area of San Francisco and only a short walk to the cable car line and the local diner. As a lone, female traveler, this hotel was ideally situated for me and felt quite safe after darkI found check-in to be no great hassle and the room clean and in good repair. However, the walls were thin and had some trouble sleeping the first night, but was ok there after as the neighbours checked out.The staff were mediocre and didn't seem to know when the Bistro was open - having been told on two consecutive nights that it would be open and then finding it wasn't. On check out I also asked to settle the bill (which I did) and then returned home to find more charges had been made to my credit card. I contacted the hotel about this and they eventually made a refund as a good will gesture.For the money I paid it was an ok place to stay, but would probably try somewhere else next time, although there was nothing majorly wrong with the hotel."
21,2087,"Dec 23 2008 	was a great budget stay	I was originally booked elsewhere but due to the economic downturn looked for something a little cheaper and let me say what great thing that was. I arrived to a really lovely reception, very easy to get to from the bart and my room was very clean, and simply furnished in a warm and welcoming way. I found the surrounding areas excellent to get great food, shopping and minutes from the cablecar or muni. The staff were more than pleasant and the housekeeping a dream. I booked tours through the hotel and all was above and beyond my expectaions. The hotel is not too noisy or in that bad an area as other reviews have noted. There is a soup kitchen of sorts in the church at the end of the street but people should appreciate that instead of being offended by this. I am a single female traveller and at no time in this area did I feel concerned for my safety. There are always people around and the few down and outs that I did encounter were extremely polite. I would definately stay here again."
22,2087,"Dec 9 2008 	Just the right value for your money	Warning: Long Read.I gave the Hotel a neutral 3 star mark because I want the reader to be objective in my review and decide for themselves. Satisfaction is subjective and thus my experiences may be positive in my view yet unacceptable for others. To give 5 stars and relate only positives of how wonderful the hotel and services were reads like home TV shopping actors sharing their joy. I am doing this review because, like me I depended on guest experiences to choose which hotel will best suit my budget and needs. I found the reviews on Mark Twain acceptable, and though there were other hotels showing up with lower rates, I decided not to risk too much on my few days in SF. I booked for the Marriot for my first 4 days of business activity and moved at Mark Twain (MT) for the rest of my weekend. Reception.The MT reception area was well decorated and furnished. The Fish n Farm restaurant is in it and makes one think its part of the hotel. Its not a big hotel so dont expect a big lounge. I arrived around 12pm but I was told to wait 2 more hours in observance of check-in time. I have booked online and stated in my check-in time. For that matter, I think it was just in-house policy and felt suckered about it, at the least, it gave me ample time to have brunch at the next door cafe-diner a good and recommendable breakfast place and it turned out to be always packed too. Building and Room.Elevator is small and will not beat your running down the stairs, which by the way, is narrow too. Its a small hotel remember? And these tiny inconveniences just added more interesting things to remember while in SF  its subjective. The building itself is old, as observed from the plastered-painted-plastered-painted concrete windows on the corridors... old but maintained, as is the flavor that is SF. The room is cozy, I like natural lighting and thats what the wooden blinders do perfectly well. Its spacious enough and clean. I dont know how monstrous one can be not to fit in the bed and room itself. I must admit the bath, old-rose pinked with a lil hint of old European flare is a little bit on the cramped-closet feeling. If you are huge, say a 6 foot 300 pound gorilla, stay away from this hotel, u wont even get pass the snailovator. Stuff in the Room. The towels were fluffy and new, actually better than the Marriots. Clean. I did not need to nit pick on every crevices and nooks, I did not find dusts, I did not meet cockroaches, the beds were made, the bath was maintained and stain free. It did not stink. The carpet is cheap but not that bad, though Grey is not really a pleasing color. The beds are good enough, just fair for me due to the crappy throw and under sheet that is close to like rubbing ones skin on an itchy wool. Wool is nice, Its different when u sleep with it. You may probably request for another blanket. Theres no AC, and u dont need one in Winter. Air circulation? Open the windows genius. Complimentary coffee and condiments but no complimentary water, its tagged at $4.00 - do you see the entrapment? All hotels do this anyway. The radiator is old school and makes that clankety-clank-clank sound when warm water is pumped in at night; Its a remarkable thing from the past, I even took pictures of it ?. The walls were not good enough to completely dampen the next rooms TV, but then I planned on getting out and experiencing SF, thus, I went back to my hotel dead-tired and bloated with all the Asian food Ive consumed, so, no, the noise was not a problem for me.Service.Service was good, except that it was ruined for me by just one night shift front desk that yelled at me and disapproved of my forcing the hotel doors open (I did not know it was supposed to be locked at night and I thought I just wasnt pushing hard enough) ..as I walked in, he asked, in reprimand, If I did not see the sign that says something bout the doors? Stupid question. Well I obviously did not see it&quot;, I replied. How could one see a signpost that is off the line of vision, a few meters away, inside a glass door at night? But in fairness, all other staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. Whatever the reason, I think it is a terrible mistake to reprimand a customer. And yes, this is the cost of that mistake. If you are a Marketing analyst, the impact of negative reviews should scare you.Location, shlocation.There were homeless, beggars, drunks and just about those that have some sort of business on the gutters. But, you can find them everywhere you go in that downtown area, even at Union Square, so It is not factual to single it out to the hotels location. The hotel is a good few blocks from the main shopping places. It is also a good few blocks where one is better off not to go, but again, so are the other hotels. Prime locations drive prices higher. If you will place MT in the middle of the shopping district, you probably will have to pay double. Its my first time in SF and in my impression there was a stark contrast that no less than a single block can separate the luxurious rich from the humbled poor. Such places exist all over the world. I followed an advise not to go to places that I was not sure of and tried not to turn right. There were other budget hotels within scary blocks, of which I was glad I did not book into. But as curiosity is the mother of all discoveryand cause of most deaths for cats, I ventured right once and much experienced the adrenaline rush I was asking for. I did not get mugged or sumthing, just stared at like I was dinner and goes well with ketchup. Overall, I got what I was expecting. A hotel that fit into my budget needs. This is not a hotel that families stay at all day and enjoy the perks  there are no perks. It is a place where one can watch CNN, sleep, wake up, bathe comfortably and go about their business outside the hotel. If you are paranoid on anything that moves at the streets at night, go somewhere else. It is competitively priced against all other budget hotels within the area, and since I only stayed at 1 other hotel in SF, I cannot really compare it further. But if I do compare it with what Marriot charged and what I got from it, I can say Mark Twain is great deal. Hotels sell location, lodging and services. When you have equally competing lodges and accommodations, it will be down to location and service. Cant do much with location, its a fixed asset. It is then detrimental that hotel staff should understand the importance of service. In this experience, one single event dented an otherwise completely grunt-free stay. Customer Service is very fragile and for that matter, I do not agree in shutting out customers because of their obnoxious behavior; (as was expressed in the Fish n Farm story of the noisy drunk), bothersome or not, the customer deserves more apology than justification. It is not in the merchants best interest to teach customers lessons  you dont do that to gods who can speak your ill and do damage ten folds. Its about tactics and good negotiation skills. Tough job, but thats what service is about.Finally, I would recommend the hotel for what was worth what I paid for, and for the courtesy of other staff members who apologized in behalf of the rude treatment I got from the night shift guy."
23,2087,"Nov 20 2008 	Might as well just book a room at the Hilton	Let me first start off by saying, yes, this hotel is in one of the seedier parts of town. However, anywhere in Downtown SF is going to be somewhat seedy. I booked a room here because they had mentioned that it was recently renovated..... Didn't see much of that. The rooms looked like it just had been re-painted. There were cracks in the molding, an old radiator heater that I've only seen on old TV shows, tiny bathroom, extremely tiny elevator that I wouldn't even take if I was going downstairs. However, the stairs weren't even that much better. Granted, I have somewhat big feet(size 13), but I felt like I could, slip off at any moment (and I wasn't even drinking!) Air circulation was horrible. The windows opened a massive 3 inches to a wonderful view of a brick wall and dark alley. When we checked in, I asked about the wireless internet access. He charged us the 9.95, but forgot to give me the password. Apparently his attention span is only 1 minute. Luckily we were only there for one night. We do not plan to EVER go to this hotel again, and suggest that no one ever stays here unless you've completely run out of options. If I have to give advice, suck up the extra money and stay at the Hilton. The Hilton is EXPONENTIALLY better in every aspect.Once again, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! It's cheaper for a reason. F@#% THE HOTEL MARK TWAIN"
24,2087,"Nov 20 2008 	Hated it!!! Do not I repeat do not stay here!	Hotel Mark Twain was HORRIBLE!!! The location was bad but that was not even the worst part. The staff was completely useless and very unhelpful. Small everything: elevators, rooms, stairs, everything! I did not feel comfortable there and it seemed like the staff was only trying to bill as much as they could squeeze from their guests. No amenities or services. Not a very nice room or linens. I simply hated my stay there and I will never stay there again. I do not recommed the hotel; there are plenty of better places to stay in the city. The staff is terrible and the hotel should be embarrassed to keep such employees."
25,2087,"Nov 17 2008 	Mark Twain Recommended!!	We had just drove in from Fresno CA which is about a 3.5 hr drive to San Francisco. We were very tired and as we checked in the Mark Twain we were greeted with a very warm and professional approach. The staff were expedient in having us checked into our rooms and being that we were so exhausted, the less time we stood in front of the front desk personnel was a major plus in our sleep time!(if you know what I mean) and more relax time! Ive noticed the service was above par and Mark Twain's manager I call him &quot;Mr. Jake&quot; has treated me and my family with service that I havent seen for a long time. The rates are reasonable and the service-excellent!! ThankYou Mark Twain's manager and staff for making our stay such a pleasant one! You have made a customer for life.Fresno68"
26,2087,"Oct 21 2008 	A Resonable Hotel at a Resonable Rate	.They say that the fish restaurant on the ground floor is good but I was unable to get a booking and this, no doubt, evidence of it's popularity. The hotel is clean and the staff were helpful. The room I had was small but reasonably comfortable.I booked the hotel on price, and I encourage visitors to book through the discount shops, I tend to use either 'expedia' or 'hotwire' but there are plenty of others, and got what I expected. Perhaps a little bit more. I have no complaints in terms of th hotel, the location is perhaps not the best, but SF is not a large city and one can either walk, which is fun under the Californian sun, or take transport to wherever you wish to go in the city. It is sufficiently central to be in reach of most places within the heart of the cityExpect not too much and you will be pleasantly surprised."
27,2087,"Oct 20 2008	Nice Hotel	Stayed here on the first night of an Explore trip in the US. Very pleasant hotel. Clean, Comfortable and spacious rooms. Only issue is traffic noise from the street, Very difficult to get a proper night sleep in front facing rooms"
28,2087,"Oct 15 2008 	Not good and charges not clear	The area is awful - when we arrived a very dishevelled person was throwing up in the next doorway. They charge $25+ per day for parking. There is no breakfast - despite what it said on Hotels.com. We are trying to work out charges which were made on our credit card which were not made clear by the hotel. I would rather stay in a Travellodge or similar than this place. It is also extremely noisy with sirens, music and people shouting outside. They do not provide cots for infants. The staff are unfriendly. Avoid it!"
29,2087,"Sep 9 2008 	Nice Boutique Hotel - Great Value!	I've been to SF many times and usually stayed at one of the 'big name' chain hotels. This time I was more interested in a smaller boutique hotel at a better price. I was not disappointed with my choice.The hotel has a great location, close to Union Sq, the theatre district and Market St. Yes, you'll find homeless people asking for change on your way there, the same ones you'll pass as you come out of the Hilton directly across the street. This is SF; if you want to stay downtown, deal with it.The hotel itself is charming, from the lobby to the small bar at the back. I was surprised how busy yet welcoming it was as I came in one evening.There is only one elevator, so be prepared to wait, or take the stairs. The Mark Twain is an older hotel and preserves some of the orginal charm. I think trying to put in another elevator would ruin that feeling. Once upstairs, the rooms are nicely appointed, if not very large. I didn't come to spend time in the room or bath, so why complain? Everything was clean and orderly when I arrived, and just the same after daily housekeeping. Additionally, all the towels were brand new as of my stay, and there is an environmentally-friendly option to keep the same towels for a multi-day stay. There's no a/c in most rooms, but the ceiling fan worked great, and this was during the hottest week of the summer.The restaurant attached to the hotel was very popular and crowded every night. One night there was even a private function attended by several high ranking Law Enforcement Officers.The staff was ALWAYS friendly and helpful, even when a busload of Italian tourists arrived and filled the lobby. I never felt like I was bothering the front desk staff, and I tend to ask a lot of questions. Special thanks go out to Kevin, the marketing manager, who was more than helpful even with his busy schedule, and to Sean, Maria and Rudolph at the front desk."
30,2087,"Jul 7 2008 	Way Below Expectations	Before booking this hotel, I looked through expedia's reviews as well as hotels.com and didn't find any negative reviews, or at least negative enough to keep me from visiting this hotel. It was a really good price, but I wish I had spent more money on a better hotel in a nicer area. Shady was to say the least. Cops frequented the area, mainly because of the homeless population and the type of individuals in the area. The map says it's in Union Square, and it is...on the very edge. It's closer to Tenderloin which is SF's bad area. Inside the hotel: The lobby is nice, but that's as far as it goes. The room was tiny, walls were paper thin, view looked over a scuzzy alley way, and we heard noises all through the night (car alarms, trash trucks, other loud noises outside). The bathroom was gross and cold. The walls were cracked, the carpet was stained (where it actually covered the floor, in our room-the carpet didn't actually go all the way to the wall and showed dirty concrete beneath). The only positive I have to say about the hotel is that the staff was super friendly and made the stay bearable. The house keeping even folded our clothes and placed them on the bed. Parking is pricey: valet only, $28.50/day *they advertise $25 but forget to mention taxes and fees*. Spend a little more and stay in a better area."
