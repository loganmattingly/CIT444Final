167,2142,"Sep 20 2007	Great location but very disappointing hotel	I have just returned from a trip to San Francisco. We stayed in the Radisson Hotel on Fishermans Wharf. The location was fantastic, the pier is very lively and there is always something happening. Not too far from Pier 33 (Alcatraz cruises) and easy access to the city centre. Having stayed in Radissons before I was very disappointed with this one. The matresses on the beds were very uncomfortable. The noise level was appalling, I found it very hard to sleep at night. The hotel breakfast was in this fast food cafe called IHOP just around the corner which was not very appetising! This was also the hotel's &quot;restaurant&quot; too and having had dinner there once, it was the greasiest meal I believe I have ever eaten. For a hotel is have a restaurant like this in such a great location in the city is ridiculous."
168,2142,"Sep 8 2007 	Location	Stayed here for 3 nights, have to say, brilliant.The location is fantastic, at the rear a safeway supermarket, to either side johnny rockets, and Ihop, and to the front you are right on fishermans wharf.Rooms are very good, cant find anything negitive to say, iron and board, refridgerator, toiletries, very fine bed and crisp bedding.Quiet rooms, nice view, free internet.The open top bus tours go from here, ie fishermans wharf, pier 39 &amp; 41 leave you spoilt for choice where to eat, we loved the crab booths.Would really recommend this hotel, I booked early and got a good rate of $168 per night which is reasonable to San Francisco, I did take a look into the Sheraton which seemed lovely as well.Loved Fishermans Wharf, yes very touristy, but everyone was here to have a good time and made for happy atmosphere, We had 2 days LA and 3 days here now I wish I did 5 days here, great holiday, will post trip report in forum alsoPlease feel free to email me if I can help, because I have had a great holiday mostly due to all the fantasic advice I got from here."
169,2142,"Sep 2 2007 	The Hotel was perfectly placed	The hotel was perfectly placed for our first visit to San Francisco, in particular for Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel was clean and in good order. The pool was very good, in particular for our chldren following a long sightseeing day!!! The bedroom we were allocated included 2 double beds that were sufficient in size for our family of 2 adults and 3 young children. The only negative point is the lack of breakfast facilities but they do have a faciity in the Reception Area where coffee and pastries can be purchased and a 24 hour restaurant next door."
170,2142,"Aug 17 2007 	Very Nice	We stayed here for 4 nights in July and overall had a very pleasant stay. It's ideally placed within very short walking distance of Pier 39 (restaurant/shopping heaven for tourists) with good access to the buses and streetcars. Taxi from SFO costs about $45 and a door-to-door van about $15-18pp. We contemplated taking a streetcar to the BART for our return journey but I wouldn't advise doing that if you've heavy luggage or if you're going to be travelling between 1000-2000 as they can get very busy. As for the hotel itself, it's a very pleasant 3* with very helpful staff. We arrived late on a Saturday night and the room we were given was really quite large. However, it was close to the elevators which make a fairly loud noise. Fortunately we were so tired it didn't keep us awake. We went to reception the next morning and requested to move, which was dealt with very promptly and we were moved as soon as a room became available. For breakfast/brunch there's a Johnny Rocket's diner at the back of the hotel which was pretty good and you can access The Wharf via this direction too. One piece of general tourist advice for this resort; book your Alcatraz trips online if you can as they get mega-busy. However, if you choose not to and you arrive at the ticket booth to discover that they're &quot;fully-booked&quot; days in advance, ignore that. You can pitch up any morning and start queuing at 0730 for an 0800 opening and you'll be able to get tickets for that day."
171,2142,"Aug 16 2007 	I would stay elsewhere	I have to say, the mixed reviews on this hotel are warranted. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years, and this one definately has some good points, like location. Granted, Fisherman's Wharf has some interesting people hanging around it, but no reason to feel unsafe in or around the hotel. Any big city has the same problems. The part I felt was very poor, was the staff at check in, terrible experience. I booked 3 rooms with BayView and they only had two when my group got there, which was very annoying given the amount of time the rooms were booked in advance of you stay. Only 1 clerk working, line of people waiting to check in, no management around to discuss the problem with. Overall, the hotel service was poor. The hotel decor is ok, sleep number beds were cool. Not worth the money they want for this hotel. Next time, I'd probably try the Sheraton across the street, or the Holiday Inn."
172,2142,"Aug 12 2007	OK but I wasn't impressed with Fishermans Wharf area	The hotel was adequate. The room was OK, the pool was a bonus. The concierge was helpful and there was a complimentary on-line flight check-in facility which was useful.Otherwise the facilities in the hotel were poor e.g. no restaurant although you didn't have to walk far (a short step to the adjacent Wharf) to get food and drink. As a first time visitor to San Francisco I was disappointed with Fishermans Wharf. I would stay nearer Union Square next time.San Francisco is a beautiful city but I think the Wharf is not the best place to be."
173,2142,"Aug 9 2007	Great location and value	Hotel is in a wonderful location, steps from Fisherman's Wharf and really good value. Staff were friendly and the hotel and room was clean. Rooms were just a bit on the small side but adequate and problem free for us. I've definitely seen smaller. Mini safe was a good feature. Hotel location is very much in a tourist area. The F Line street car is right out both the front and the back of the hotel. Hotel is in a good location for walking, biking, renting cars, public transit. If you rent cars in this area I recommend returning them each night. Parking at the hotel is $40 per night or it can be had for free at the rental car outlet. If you want to go to Alcatraz, book your tickets as soon as you arrive, or better still on line before you go. Only one company actually goes to the island and their tickets are in high demand."
174,2142,"Aug 7 2007 	Nice Hotel for Tourists and Families	I thought this is a great hotel for tourists, right in the heart of the Fishermans Wharf action. We had a small, but comfortable king room on the second floor, at the end of the corridor, a great location to keep the noise down. We were assigned a room with a Sleep Number bed which my husband described as an overpriced air mattress. It was comfortable enough, but I wouldnt run out and buy one! The room had very nice amenities: coffee maker, iron and full sized ironing board, hair dryer, nice bathroom stuff, excellent water pressure and lots of counter room, and best of all, free Wifi so I could use my Palm to check my email (only twice in three days, which is infrequent for me!) The AC and fan worked very well, providing a nice steady hum which drown out most of the noise at night and let us sleep very well. They had an outdoor pool that was full of children, but we had no intentions of swimming in the chilly July weather! We didnt have much interaction with staff, but what we had was pleasant and efficient. The room was clean and the dcor was actually pretty up-to-date and attractive! I would recommend the Radisson as a good family and tourist hotel."
175,2142,Aug 3 2007	The Place is a Dump	We were so disappointed with this hotel that we checked out early. I did NOT feel safe. The parking lot was confusing and I was afraid to go from parking to rooms alone. Very long and confusing corridors. This hotel is located in a seedy section of Fisherman's Wharf.
176,2142,"Jul 30 2007 	Okay if you like the smaell of Clam Chowder!	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in July. Hmmm...first impressions, NOT GREAT! Check in staff - RUDE! Our room safe needed a different code everyday as everytime we returned to the room, our safe wouldn't open, granted they did send someone to attend to this quite quickly but strange that it was always after we'd left the room un-occupied! The furniture and carpets are old, need up-graded! Location is great if you like smelling clam chowder all day and all night!! Lots of tramps and beggers hang around the hotel, quite un-nerving.I wouldn't stay at this hotel again - EVER!"
177,2142,"Jul 28 2007	Once was enough...	Unfortunately, once was enough to know we won't stay at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf again. There is something about the exterior of this hotel that looks more like 1960's Florida than San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. The interiors have been remodeled, but there is the feeling that as many roooms as possible have been crammed into this location, much more so than the usual...even for San Francisco. The physical layout of the floor interiors is prison-like with narrow, long hallways..extremely narrow...even for such a large hotel.. The rooms are crammed in there quite tight and are very, very small. Only two elevators for this large hotel...clearly not enough for the number of rooms, so long wait times. Old bathrooms that have been remodeled. The room was surface clean, but the opened doors on armoire holding the television were coated with sticky fingerprints and smudges...clearly hadn't been wiped down in ages. Wallpaper dried out and peeling in room, carpet torn away from bathroom door threshold. Indifferent and unfriendly staff. The only employee that smiled and was helpful was a concierge named Olivia. The rest of the staff was completely disinterested and unsmiling. The pool area was shabby and dirty. Altogether, the atmosphere at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf is tired, cramped, crabby, cheap looking and very crowded."
178,2142,"Jul 25 2007 	Highway 1	Stayed here two nights at the start of a trip down higway 1 to Sta Monica. The room was quite good, with a nice view over the pool area. The hotel was quiet and in an excellent position for excursions. Walking distance to cable cars, pier 39 restaurants, chinatown etc. The price was also reasonable."
179,2142,"Jul 24 2007 	Disappointed	We really wanted to like this hotel but, too many little things were wrong. Booked our room on line and preregistered so check-in was a breeze. We were not happy about many things in our room. Like: peeling wallpaper, sleep number bed not plugged in and not enough plugs for beds and lights (forget a computer), bed seemed to lose air, only place in bathroom to set a bag, was on the floor, closet doors wouldn't close with clothes hanging, no table (there was a desk), only 2 chairs (room was set-up for 4), no frig, lack of places to charge phones and cameras, bright lights from parking area filled the room if curtains were opened and more. Little things but they add up. The bathroom was really small with no place to put personals, a shelf would have helped a lot. The room was clean and the daily service good and prompt. The air conditioning is indeed very noisy but necessary as we found out when we lost power one evening and had to try to sleep in an overly warm stuffy room. On the good side the location can't be beat, you are right on fisherman's wharf and it has a pool. I found most of the employees very accommodating. If you drive don't forget to add the $34.20 per night parking fee (the parking spots are very narrow). Would I stay here again? No, but I give it a rating of two based on cleanliness, location and pool."
180,2142,Jul 5 2007 	Best place to stay on a budget	This hotel is in the best location! It is at Fisherman's Warf. The room was modern and clean. The staff couldn't be any friendlier! The pool is heated. I will only stay at this hotel whenever I visit San Francisco.
181,2142,"Jun 26 2007	Radisson Fishermans Wharf	Radisson Fishermans Wharf. Third year in a row. Everything went great as usual. Staff is all ways great. Location is right where I want to be. One note- theres a Walgreens right up the street and it came in handy this trip. All ways forget something! Had a very small problem, It was handled qucikly and professionally. It was not a problem for me , but more of a heads up for staff. This is the place to be to get any where, street cars ,cable cars walking. Price was good for San Francisco. Clean and those sleep number beds what a treat! Housecleaning staff was on top of everything every day. All in all a great place to stay. Would I stay here again. Oh wait ! I have three years in a row. I'll be back next year. Stay was 14 May 07 - 18 May 07. The passageway from the pool area to Jefferson St. is a time saver and puts you right on the wharf."
182,2142,"Jun 25 2007 	Not bad - very comfortable beds!!!!	We stayed at the raddison for 3 nights from 6th- 9th June. Staff at reception were friendly although a bit slow at checking us in. Property was in good condition and rooms were well proportioned and clean. The bed was probably the best part of the room: it was king size and you could change the softness/harness of the bed on the two different sides of the bed to whatever you wished by using a remote control. View was poor but to be honest we didn't spend much time in the room so weren't that bothered.Position was great. Below the hotel was IHOP which did good breakfasts although extremely big portions and hotel was within walking distance to all public transport and fishermans wharf,All in all not a bad hotel!!!!We booked an airpot transfer back to airport from the hotel and they were on time, friendly and a competitive price."
183,2142,"Jun 18 2007 	Save your money and go somewhere else	This hotel was nothing like it appeared on the website. The amenities were totally outdated. For example, one machine in the workout area was broke for an entire week! Secondly, since I am a non-smoker, to smell someones else's cigarette smoke was really an inconvenience! Not to mention to place you in rooms with broken furniture, outdated and worn out carpet and toilets which doesnt flush. Several nights I was awakened by commotions outside of my window..and the window as closed. I finally requested to move until another room in which I finally obtained a room with a view. It was like night and day. Of all of the Radison hotel's I have ever stayed in, this was one of the worst hotels of the lot. They save the best rooms for the expensive clientel and give the crappy rooms for everyone else. I seen this first hand. I dont recommend my pet poodle stay in this ghetto dump hotel. On a positive note, you are in walking distance to Pier39 which has absolutely fabulous restaurants which specialized in seafood. Plus the tours are fabulous!"
184,2142,"Jun 11 2007 	Best San Fran Hotel for First Timers Families Friends!	My family and I (parents and brother) stayed at the Fisherman's Wharf for three nights in early May as part of our cruise package vacation. This was our first time to San Fran, and it was absolutely amazing!The cruise package consisted of 3 nights in San Fran and a coastal cruise back to Vancouver (where we're from), and Bon Voyage Holidays (tour operator) seems to know what they are doing in terms of a great deal. The price of the total package was a mere $621 CAD plus tax, which covered the flight down to San Fran, 3 nites hotel, all transfers, and a two night coastal cruise on the luxurious Golden Princess back home.When they say this hotel is centrally located they weren't kidding. This hotel is located RIGHT off the Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf--a must see for those visiting San Fran. The main entrance faces the side street, but you can walk through the courtyard by the pool and there's a hallway that takes you to the wharf, or you can walk around.The rooms were spacious and very clean. We had two side-by-side rooms with comfy sleep number double beds to each person. Washrooms were basic, but clean. The hotel is large and was always busy since it seems that it was a popular package for tour groups.Checkin WAS the most amazing and painfree I've ever had since the tour operator had pre-arranged our rooms and we were given key cards that didn't need to be returned. You just got your stuff and checked out by 11--perfect!There is a safeway very near by two blocks down in the mini mall and you can grab all sorts of fruit, water, and drinks for you choice which you can stock in your complimentary mini fridge. There is also a complimentary safe for your valuables and it's big enough to fit a laptop. There was WIFI and we were able to connect for free!! Perfect for checking email and updating your friends on your trip.The only thing is that this is clearly and older building and the windows are thin. It can be pretty bright due to its proximity to the wharf, and even somewhat noisy at times due to the traffic outside. The Sleep Number beds were comfy though, and even fun to use. You can access all the transportation from the hotel with little trouble as the F line street car is down the street, and you can hop on the historic cable cars to downtown easily. We purchased the Go San Francisco Card (2 day for $65 USD) from Orbitz.com (look it up under &quot;activities&quot; and it is a must buy as you save a ton of money to 40 attractions including the red &amp; white fleet boat cruise (we did this first for a good overview of the city and its history), the grayline hop-on-hop-off tour, the aquarium at pier 39, and the exploritorium at the palace of fine arts (beautiful!!) to name a few. I also recommend tourists go to destinationcoupons.com for a free Pier 39 Funpack booklet for great discounts including at the famous Boudins sourdough bakery stores/cafes. There is a 24hour IHOP downstairs at the hotel, but we opted for Boudins. Try their soudough french toast!! It's to die for.All in all I would definitely stay here again. The weather was better than expected (windy, but warm), and the city was utterly beautiful. Would definitely come back again!Please let me know and/or vote if you thought this review was useful--feedback is always nice!"
185,2142,"Jun 9 2007 	confusing nasty stairway access	Can't believe nobody mentioned that you have to use outside stairways to get to the second floor, then passkeys into the hallway and elevators up to floors. No lobby access to rooms, multiple public access points to stairs. Absolutely did NOT feel safe in these stairs or halls. Shabby carpet, dinged-up veneer furniture, wallpaper peeling, window that wouldn't stay open and (of course) no screens. Not worth the money we saved (AAA deal - free parking). Avoid this one if you like safe, controlled room access!!!!"
186,2142,"Jun 3 2007 	Over Priced Under Sized	For $300/Night we got a tiny room with threadbare carpeting, worn out furniture, no closet just a wardrobe which along with the bed took up most of the room. The bathroom fan rattled like crazy and the bathroom was very small. The halls were cramped and dingy as was the lobby. We expected more for the money. Location is good, we could walk everywhere but that didn't make up for the price and the lack of ammenities."
187,2142,"Jun 2 2007 	Good location and value	I've stayed at this hotel about three times in the past. My most recent stay was in May 07. Like any hotel, there are pros and cons. The Pros: Location: it's located in Fisherman's Wharf. Some people may criticize the area as a 'tourist trap', but I find it an interesting and lively area. Why stay downtown when you can be in the waterfront with views of the bay, Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz island? The hotel is also within walking distance to cable cars, Muni busline and the F-line (streetcars). Plus, there are plenty of restaurants and shops around. The price: it costs compartively less than other surrounding hotels in Fisherman's Wharf. However, the Radisson is no five-star accommodation; so if you're looking for something like the Ritz, go to the Ritz! The basic amenities/service: It was somewhat slow at check-in (apprx. 15-20 min.), but not a big deal, esp. since I went to SF on a holiday weekend. I requested in advance a room near an elevator, and they did honor that request. The lobby was clean and they had a helpful concierge. My room size (city view w/king) was comfortable for a single traveler; it would be fine for two as well. Overall, it was clean with everything working. Another plus-they have 'sleep number' / sleep comfort beds (which you can customize) in most, if not all, their rooms. The cons: Location: My room was facing the back street, which could be somewhat noisy at times. But overall, I didn't have much problem getting sleep (okay if not in the room most of the day). Additional amenities/service: My only minor 'complaint' is the air conditioning, which was a bit old-style and making a bit of noise when turned on. They also have a back entrance/exit which leads directly to the main street at the wharf. But I was told this door does not work at times when you swipe your room card. The hotel doesn't have its own restaurant and doesn't offer continental breakfast, but it wasn't a big deal for me since there are so many nearby restaurants. Overall, it was a good stay and a good value. I would recommend this hotel for most people."
188,2142,"May 24 2007 	A difficult choice	Hotel accommodation in SF is expensive - fact. Fisherman's Wharf is the US equivalent of Blackpool (no offence meant). So, if you are looking for &quot;reasonably&quot; priced accommodation in a convenient location (we were in SF one night and had booked the Alcatraz tour) then the Radisson is a fair option. Just don't expect any frills.The room looked directly out onto (not over) a car park - in which we had to pay a further $30+tax to park. So even though the hotel is close to the water front, don't expect views.The room was clean, tidy and well furnished although lacked character. But it's in the middle of a vast swathe of restaurants and entertainments so you needn't stay in it longer than is necessary to get a good nights sleep."
189,2142,"May 15 2007 	Travel Agent Visit	Great location if you want to stay in the Wharf area. About a 5-7 minute walk to Pier 39. The outside of the hotel is not very attractive but don't let this worry you.Rooms were small but nice. My room was on the 4th floor (only 4 floors) streetside. Could hear the traffic at night but by putting the fan on, the street sound was gone.There is no restaurant on site at the hotel. Many restaurants within walking distance. In the AM there is a coffee stand in the lobby offering simple breakfast grab and go items. Next door is an IHOP offering good food and service.A small courtyard offers a small pool. The staff was polite and helpful.Parking is $40 per day.The public transportation is within 1-2 blocks from the hotel.I used an airport shuttle service and the cost is $15 one way."
190,2142,"May 11 2007	Poor	I can't believe so many people list the room being clean as a bonus - isn't this a pre requisite for ANY Hotel?On checking in we were greeted by rude staff who just seemed to want to get rid of us as soon as possible, the rooms were more basic than some of the smaller chains we stayed in, and the outside door to the car park wouldn't shut - not exactly secure.still, the location for Fisherman's wharf is great, but unlike other city hotels, no information was offered on how to see the sights - strange in such a touristy area."
191,2142,"May 6 2007 	Better than expected	Reviews of this hotel varied from very good to poor, so we didn't really know what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised by a good sized room, very comfortable king sized bed, very clean. When we complained about the toilet running on and on, it was fixed the next day. We were on the 2nd floor, by the parking lot (very sparsely used) and so had a view of Alcatraz and Fisherman's Wharf, which we enjoyed. We found it very convenient for shopping as we could pop down one floor and be on Jefferson Street, right in the middle of shopping and restaurants. I wouldn't recommend the IHOP - too busy and not great food. Johnny Rockets makes a good breakfast, and try Boudin's for Clam Chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. Close to the tour buses, Pier 39 and the Alcatraz ferry (which I recommend)."
192,2142,"May 2 2007 	A good option in Fisherman's Wharf	RadissonThe location of the Radisson couldnt be better, just a few blocks from the Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39 and the pier where leaves the boat to Alcatraz, close to restaurants and the Cable Car stop. The most expensive ride by taxi was from the airport: about US$ 45. To Union Square it was about US$ 8. You can also get the Cable Car to downtown (US$5, 25 per person), the stop is 3 blocks from the entrance of the hotel. But we enjoyed a lot walking around instead of taking cabs.Our room was very clean, we had a king bed with nice and clean linens and extra pillows. The bathroom had complete set of shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion replaced every day. It also had a hair dryer and iron in the room. The service was great from the front desk to the housekeeping.We got the best rate in our entire trip! And again: very comfortable and very close to everything. For my first time in SF it was great to stay in a place close to tourist attractions, but maybe next time Ill try a different neighborhood."
193,2142,"Apr 30 2007 	Location LocationLocation	We stayed 2 nights at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco from 4/14 to 4/16. We got there earlier than the posted check in time but were allowed to go to our room 3 hours early. Matt, the hotel clerk was courteous and accommadating. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable, with a balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel is located across the street from Fisherman's wharf Pand you are within walking distance to Pier 39, Alcatraz cruises, and the Trolley. There are restaurants and entertainment aplenty near this hotel."
194,2142,"Apr 23 2007 	Not a bad stay	Stayed here for a business meeting and thought it was just average for what you pay. Contrary to other reviews, I had no problem with the size or cleanliness of the room (King sleep number bed). We did have problems with the concierge's knowledge of the city. When we went across the street to the information center at Pier 39 to ask questions, they said that they frequently had guests from our hotel over there asking questions. As for the location, some might think it's great. However, I wasn't all that excited about being that close to Fisherman's Wharf. It was so congested everywhere you went. That's fine for a short visit to Fisherman's Wharf, but I prefer somewhere a little more remote for an extended stay. Whenever we would go out for lunch, it would always be a real hassle to get around all the people and find somewhere to eat."
195,2142,"Apr 22 2007 	Good Experience w/Radisson SF	This hotel was wonderful everything from location, service, cleaniness and convenience. The hotel is across the street from the wharf so it was nice to step out onto the street and walk to Pier 39 and the surrounding areas. The cable car route is conveniently 3 blocks away. It was nice to park the car for a day at the hotel and explore the city on public transit. We received coupons for breakfast to the IHOP restaurant located downstairs; the service was fast even though crowded with tourists. The bed had wonderful down comforters, a definite luxury! There were many restaurants around the wharf but if you want to get away from seafood, go to Columbus Ave. which is only blocks away. That street has so many italian restaurants! Chinatown is only minutes away as well. We have 3 children so staying at this hotel helped make SF a wonderful experience for us."
196,2142,"Apr 11 2007 	Great location comfy beds	We stayed at the Radisson in March, found a great deal on Travelzoo that included the free parking. Staying here is worth it for the free parking as it runs on average $28 a day. We checked in pretty late and staff was curtious and swift at getting us to our room. Definetly utilize the conceriege's knowledge of the city, that is what he's there for. The bed was very comfy, we were upgraded to the king sleep number. The room was spacious and quiet considering its in the middle of Fishermans Wharf. Which brings me to the location. GREAT! Right across the street from Pier 39 and a short walk to the cable car stop, which I would recommend to anyone if they've never seen San Francisco. Overall, a great trip and an enjoyable stay!"
197,2142,"Apr 11 2007 	Ouch!	For our family vacation, I decided to splurge a little and pay a little more for a nice, safe and well located hotel. For the price I paid I was expecting more. Then upon arrival, I was told I needed to pay for parking at the hotel, which was an additional $45.00 per night. OUCH! I was told this is standard for all hotels in the area and had I booked directly from their website I would have been aware of such a large additional fee. The lady at the front desk was not pleasant at all. I could hear the people on the floor above us - walking. The room was clean, but small. For the price....IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. Will not stay there again!"
198,2142,"Mar 25 2007 	Perfect Location	We stayed at the Raddison in November and only had one problem on arrival. After an exhausing 16 hour journey they gave us the key to an occupied room. We went straight back to reception and it was resolved straight away! The room we got was very large and clean and the bed was comfy too!! The positioning of this hotel is PERFECT. You can hear the sea lions at night from pier 39 its that close! On our first morning we went out walking at 7.00 (jet lag!!) and it was so peaceful seeing the stall holders setting up for the day and we could see the Golden gate bridge in the distance. We then walked back to see the sealions and ride the carousel on pier 39. (an absoulute must for those kids at heart!) Then over to alcatraz you need to book your tickets in advance for this and make sure you take the audio tour! The hotel is within easy walking distance for the tram turnaround at Hyde street. Make sure you go early morning though as you are in for a long wait during the day!The price of this hotel and location cannot be faulted, I would definetly use again!!"
199,2142,"Mar 21 2007 	Great location!	We took our Dad and Mom to SF to spend a long weekend. With Dad not being in very good health, we wanted a hotel in a good location. The Radisson definitely fits the bill! There is lots to do within walking distance. Breakfast at the IHOP was very good, and we really enjoyed lunch at Johnny Rockets. The hotel rooms were average...We didn't have the sleep number beds (my brother unexpectedly joined us, and reserved a room the day of his check in, paying almost 1/2 of what I paid, and getting a view and the sleep number beds.. our view was of the parking lot)... but the hotel did honor our request for connecting rooms. The staff was very attentive to our needs, responding very quickly to our requests.Don't expect luxury....it's far from that, but very clean, and has the basic necessities needed.. I would stay again...think it is a great place for families.."
200,2142,"Mar 20 2007 	Just fair at best............	Stayed here March 11-13. Let me start by saying that this was our first time to San Francisco and this hotel was in the PERFECT location......right in the middle of everything on the wharf.However, the location and the front desk staff were about all that was good.The front desk staff were so attentive and friendly, that it almost makes it hard to complain about the hotel. BUT the hotel is very old and needs a re-model. The hallways are very long, narrow, and musty. The doorways to the rooms are smaller than on a cruise-ship, so getting your luggage in the room is a real treat.The room itself was very small with a small bathroom. I had called and requested a top floor room with a view of Alcatraz. Our room was on the top floor (3rd) , at the very end of the hallway (farthest away from elevators)and had a view of a street. The room was hot and musty, and the window air conditioner didn't seem to be working well initially, so we tried to open the window. The windows must be the originals because they were on an old metal frame that made it almost impossible to open and close.The good news is that the air conditioner kicked in and worked well throughout our stay.We did have a sleep number, king size bed....Unfortunately, the bed took up most of the room. There really wasn't even a place to put our suitcases other than on the bed.My biggest complaint is the smell in the hallways. It was some kind of fake citrus smell...probably to cover the musty smell....but it was WAY too strong...and made me want to puke everytime I was in the hallways. The coke machine on our floor was faulty...and would just eat your money. The front desk refunded it, but it was inconvenient to not have access to a soda machine. The pool area was very small, but seemed to be clean and the water was warm.I would say that this 'motel' is okay if you want a good location for alcatraz trips, tours, pier 39, etc. but it isn't worth more than $99/night, which a deal we found online. Also, just FYI, the cab trip from the airport to the pier area is $45-50.00...and I would NOT recommend renting a car in San Francisco, as there are plenty of ways to get around and parking is expensive!!!"
201,2142,"Mar 12 2007	Great Location.Top QualityWould definately use again!	I stayed at the Radisson from the 1st March-8th as a solo traveller on my own and found it a top quality excellent hotel. The location is perfect for any tourist in the area. You literally come out fo the rear entrance to the hotel past the pool and you are across the road from Pier 39 and the street performers and on the same side as all the shops and resturants. I got a good rate of $99 per night before tax which is a fantastic rate for a hotel of this standard and in such a good location, I have stayed at Radisson chains before and this was one if not the best one so far.I had room 4051 on the 4th floor with a King sleepnumber bed which was very comfortable indeed,made everyday and had at least 6 very cofmortable pillows and a nice cover. The room was nice and spacious and very quiet at night with no noise coming from the front or any other guests for that matter. Nice sized television with all the channels you needed and complimentary Wi-Fi broadband available in the room which i used with my laptop on the in room desk area.The bathroom was very clean and spacious with a good sized bath/shower and plenty of fresh towels and toiletries left daily which was a nice welcome.The hotel is ajoined to Johnny Rockets which is handy and the pool is great,I never got to try the gymn area but saw it and it looked pretty cool. Has a nice seating area outside too as I enjoyed the warm weather there with a cool drink on occassions and lots of seating area in the lobby to relax with a drink and a newspaper.The location is such that you do not need to use public transport, From here I walked everywhere including to Chinatown,North Beach,Lombard street/Nob hill and all of the front and on one hot day I walked from the hotel to the Golden gate bridge along the costal pathway/Chrissy fields which was all within walking distance if you dont mind walking.Theres a great place next door that offers a full american breakfast for $6.99 which is next to the seven eleven which had some good value food and a I-hop to the other side and then you have all the regular food places withina 2 min walk as well burger king/mcdonalds etc.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again if I found myself in town,The area is very safe and I walked it at all hours even to 1.30am in the morning alone and had no problems at all just the usual homeless situation that all parts of america have but they wont bother you so dont let that put you off.I have lots of pics too which I will attach shortly as I am at work at the moment,Feel free to contact me with any questions.Things I would recommend:-Use Supershuttle from SFO they offer a $15 door to door service which is very handy although the BART is not hard to navigate the shuttle is nice to just sit back and relax after a long flight.-Try the Clam Chowder and Sourdough across the road from the hotels back entrance its great-And finally definately see the city by foot (or bike) you see so much more than in a car or on public transport and get the real experience."
202,2142,"Mar 6 2007	Great spot	We spent one night (Friday night). I grew up near San Francisco and I've been to Fisherman's Wharf many times over many years. We actually got a great deal, $99 including parking, for this stay. While the property is older, the room was very nice for the price and you can't beat the location. You are literally right at Fisherman's Wharf so you walk 100 yards to the Alcatraz Ferry another 100 yards to Pier 39 or going the other way, it's a 5 minute walk to Ghiardelli Square and a terminus for the Cable Car. For dinner, go to Scoma's not the restaurants that are in plain sight. Don't miss the Buena Vista which is the world's best Irish Coffee."
203,2142,"Mar 2 2007 	Good hotel at a great price	I stayed at this hote for 1 night by myself in advance of a 6 night stay I plan to take with my family in May.I found the hotel reception staff to be very friendly and helpful.The room was really big with two queen beds, large TV, good bathroom and iron/board. A major plus was the free internet access!This is the wrong time of the year for the pool, but if looked nice.The location is good, one block from the water front of Fisherman's Wharf.I didn't try the restaurant or bar (in fact I don't even know if they have either). Top pancakes and omelette next door at the ihop!"
204,2142,Mar 2 2007	Excellent Location...Great value and comfort!	We had a wonderful time at this hotel. It is nicely remodelled and very comfortable. It was nice to sleep on a select comfort bed. Service at the desk was great. Parking is very nice too and affordable for the area. The best thing about this hotel is it's location right accross the street from Pier 39. Can't say enough about the location!! The price compared to other hotels that are not as close is excellent at least 10% less...making it a great value! If I had to search for something to criticize -- the bathrooms could be a little bigger.
205,2142,"Feb 25 2007	Its all about the location! - Rather a Motel than a Hotel experience	I spent two nights at the Radisson. The location is just brilliant for tourists - right in front of Fishermans Wharf. If you pay a little extra, you can get a partial view on the bay and specially Alcatraz. However, the hotel is really old and even for San Francisco standards expensive. It used to be a motel before Radisson took it over. Our room was ok and the bed was really comfortable. If you need some basic accommodation, the Radisson is definitely suitable."
206,2142,"Feb 22 2007 	Great service best price nice rooms pool free wireless--can't go wrong!	We stayed at the Radisson Fishermans Wharf for Presidents Day weekend and had a great experience. I own a large retail store, plus I travel a lot, so courteous service is extremely important to me. The Radisson's employees exemplified excellent customer service. They were so friendly and cheerful that even our teenagers remarked &quot;everyone' is so nice here!&quot; The rooms were just right, nothing fancy, but everything clean and working well. Sleep number beds were very comfy. Nice pool, too. Free wireless internet was a huge plus--usually get charged about $15.00 for that. We paid about $130 per night, which included a breakfast from their coffee cart. Without even being asked, the front desk upgraded that to free breakfast at the ihop next door, when we couldn't get double beds.Our only complaint was the low water pressure in shower."
207,2142,Feb 20 2007	Pleasant	The rooms were clean and even though the hotel was completely full it was relatively quiet. Parking was easy and it is bascically right on the wharf. Rooms are small but is to be expected for San francisco. I would stay there again.
208,2142,"Feb 14 2007 	Great Location	Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from Dec 12th 2006 - Dec 16th 2006. Hotel is centrally located directly across the road from the water, and only a 5 min walk to Pier 39. Rooms are clean but small for the 4 of us 2A + 2 teenagers. A 2 bed room consists of 2 double beds not 2 queen size. Bathroom adequate size but bench space too small. We had a room that looked out to Alcatraz and overlooking the pool area. There is a McDonalds next door and a Subway around the corner and an IHOP next door. Good variety of restaurants all within 2-5 minute walk. There was free internet access which is handy, an ATM located in the foyer as well as a breakfast cart that offers bagels,fruit and coffee in the morning until 11am. There is no fridge in the room just an ice bucket. The price was great considering the location and the staff more than helpful. Parking is available for around $30.00 per night. If we were in San Francisco again we would probably stay here again as the location is unbeatable."
209,2142,"Feb 5 2007	Very disappointing stay for a family with small kids	We just returned from a four-night stay at this Radisson and were very disappointed. We were traveling with our two small children (3 years old and 3 months old). The TV needed fixing twice. The doors to the TV armoire were right at toddler-head height, and did not slide into the armoire or open flush to the rest of the piece. Our son hit his head several times. The lock on our sliding door did not lock firmly, and our 3-year old was able to open the door to our fourth floor balcony. The customer service was terrible. The parking was very expensive ($28/day plus tax). The power went out in that part of town one night (not the hotel's fault, of course) but they had no generator, no way to get into the hotel from parking other than walking down the parking structure ramp (no easy feat with a toddler and an infant), no emergency lighting and no apology from the hotel for the inconvenience. And we were instructed that on our last day in the hotel, our room would be entered during a 3-hour window of time for alarm system testing. Again, not very accomodating to a traveling family. We wrote a letter to Radisson about our stay. No response yet.Positives to this stay: the Sleep Number beds. Great feature. And adjustable water flow selections in the shower. Distance to Fisherman's Wharf was excellent."
210,2142,"Jan 27 2007	Great Price Great Location	I came across a great deal via Travelzoo ($99/night), so I booked it for our MLK Jr. Day weekend getaway. The fact that the room rate INCLUDED PARKING was a major bonus, as we wanted a car for our stay. The hotel is nothing fancy (occasional smell of smoke in the halls, duct tape holding the laminent on a room door, must go outside to get to the gym/lobby rest room [it was FREEZING that weekend]), but there were plenty of pros that made it worth the price (parking included, very close to crowded, tourist-ridden Fisherman's Wharf, nice staff, ability to print your boarding passes in the lobby). Room 4022 was incredibly large with a balcony, a &quot;dressing area&quot; between the room &amp; bathroom, and a VERY large bathroom. The room was kept very clean by housekeeping. We had good temperature controll and the beds were very comfy. Bottom line: I wouldn't want to pay more than we did, but we were very happy with our stay."
211,2142,"Jan 24 2007	Radisson the worst hotel I can remember.	The room smelled horrible. I think it was smoke, despite the fact I asked for a no smoking room. I asked for a king bed room, close to the elevator. I got two doubles 500 feet from the elevator. 500 feet to walk with luggage. A very strange plan design. The sheets felt like sandpaper; very poor quality. The only good thing I can say is it is a great location; never would I stay there again."
212,2142,"Jan 21 2007	Excellent position - wonderfully comfortable bed	Great position in the centre of Fisherman's Wharf, 2 minutes from Pier 39. Rooms with a view of Alcatraz Island and the hotel outdoor pool - used in all weathers! The king size beds are wonderfully comfortable and separately adjustable electrically. Coffee machine in room and good sized tv. Consierge really helpful."
213,2142,"Jan 21 2007	They go the extra mile.	I chose this hotel via my travel agent and am pleased after an initial uneasiness. When I arrived there was only one staff member on the desk and a small queue. Suferring jet-lag i was not impressed at standing about, but another staff member soon arrived. However, she was a bit surly and not really what i would employ as front-of-house (first impressions?). Since that first tilt, things have improved though, and all other staff I have dealt with have been only too helpful and even seem to 'hover'a bit, anticipating your needs without being conspicuous about it. The location is superb and even if the hotel itself is quite old, it is kept in excellent condition and the housekeepers (room cleaners) are tops, totally non-intrusive. It is a bit like a home away from home and the staff are like the neighbours, dropping in to fix/replace/loan you things as you need them! Nothing seems to bother them.At the end of the day, you dont spend the whole of your time in your room and the most important time is sleep, and that is where the Hotel excells itself. The BEDS have an electronic control (handheld) which you can programme the bed to the degree of softness/hardness you desire. The pillows are super (feather) and there is always loads of fluffy towels in the bathroom. I really am enjoying my time here after initially giving them a (mentally) hard time. It is fabulous and I would not hesitiate to recommend it to anone.Oh, and make sure you call in advance as they have specials which is how i ended up here, for 1 week there was a tidy little discount."
214,2142,"Jan 19 2007 	A disappointing experience	I was very disappointed by this hotelThe room was extremely small - not much room beyond a double bed. Fixtures and fitting were very old and tired. Bathroom was very drab and needed modernising.The room was also very noisy - a lot of noise from the road and also from other rooms.The hotel appeared to have zero facilities - nearest bar was in the Sheraton across the road. No office facilities, WiFi etc. No concierge on the desk and no doormanIt was not terrible - it was clean and the front desk staff were Ok, but given the Radisson name and also the nightly rate relative to other hotels in the area, I would have expected 100 times more"
215,2142,"Jan 6 2007 	Great location but we expected more	The location is fabulous. You walk through the pool area and a secured hallway and you're litteraly on the pier. Everything is within walking distance so we chose not to rent a car and took shuttles between the airport and it's less expensive then renting a car for three days just to pay another $30 a day to park it. We had some great meals and the fires works from the pier on New Year's eve where wonderful. Our only disappointing meal was at &quot;Joe's Crab Shack&quot;. The fish and chips were highly recommended by our server. What was served was frozen fish from a box on top of onion rings. When ask where the chips (fries) were she replied they were out and walked off.Again, the hotel has a great location, but few amenites. No restaurant, bar or lounge. No room service. Small worn rooms and a first for me at any hotel. The iron was attached to the ironing board making it very difficult to use. I didn't know irons where such a hot item. No pun intended. All in all, it's an average hotel at best with a good location."
216,2142,"Jan 2 2007 	Travelodge kind with a Radisson name	Disappointing. We had nicer hopes about Radisson. Its a great location though. Room, shower and the entire corrider were not impressive at all. We stayed at the Wharf Inn right across the street for one night and could not find much difference between the Radisson and the Wharf Inn. Luckily we had AAA or else that would have been another 20-25$ for daily parking"
217,2142,"Dec 20 2006	Fantastic Location!!!	We did not stay here but did a sight inspection for work (I am a travel agent).Located directly opposite Fishermans Wharf the Radisson is great value for money and a fantastic location. Rooms are of a medium size and offer fabulous views of Fishermans Wharf and Alcatraz Island. Beds feature controls so guests can customize the mattress to be as soft or as firm as required. This property would be great for families, couples or business travellers."
218,2142,"Dec 3 2006 	My relatives always stay here when they come to visit	I live in San Francisco and I always advise my visiting friends and famiy to stay here and they are always happy they did. As other reviewers have said the location is the best on the wharf. The bayview rooms are wonderful but at $300+ are not neccessary, who spends time in the room except to sleep? I think they are the only hotel who have bayview rooms and in my years of making reservations for family are usually all sold out of view rooms unless reserved in advance. Also, because they sell out of those rooms means they have no rooms left to upgrade guests to. I guess you get what you pay for, but the normal rooms are just fine.The staff has always been easy to deal with, especially the maids. The rooms are clean, but somewhat dated. My mom visited recently and she got to try out one of their Sleep comfort beds with the remotes, she got a kick out of it and said it was comfortable.Anyway, this hotel is clean comfortable and wonderfully located. It's my choice of hotels on the wharf."
219,2142,"Nov 30 2006 	Great Location!	Awesome location. Pier 39 just across the street. Alcatraz cruises is a couple of blocks down on Pier 33 now. Easy access to Muni F Line that takes you to downtown thru Market St all the way to the Castro neighborhood. Very Clean hotel, and friendly staff. Will stay there again."
220,2142,"Nov 18 2006 	Location location location!	You can't get closer to the wharf. A passage behind the courtyard leads to Jefferson Street and Pier 43 1/2. Pier 39 is so close you can hear the sea lions barking if the window is open. Many rooms have a balcony overlooking the outdoor pool. Their sleep number beds seem to be mostly hype and we discarded the mattress-like coverlet for a lighter blanket. Housekeeping was quick to respond to our requests; the concierge was helpful and efficient.Mornings from 6:00 to noon there is a breakfast cart in the lobby selling take away juice, pastry, muffins and fruit. An I-Hop is a few hundred feet down Beach Street. Right off the courtyard is a Johnny Rockets. They do a full breakfast and you can play oldies on their nickel jukebox. Also convenient is the North Point Shopping Plaza a block away. Walgreen's drugstore, Safeway supermarket and a Bank of America ATM can be found there, as well as a Radio Shack and a galaxy-class telescope store. The F Line streetcar stop is a block away.Some unexpected benefits: we enjoyed walking over to the (railed) edge of the open second level parking area, where we had a 'private balcony' overlooking the never ending activity on Jefferson and the adjacent pier area. We would also go out there to feed the seagulls breakfast scraps and watch pelicans fly by in formation. The Compass Grille at the Sheraton (cocktails, lunch, dinner) is right across the street. The convenient location is its principal asset. We'd happily stay there again."
221,2142,"Oct 31 2006 	Great location	This was a very comfortable, clean hotel with a fantastic location.Plenty of food nearby &amp; Pier 39 is directly out the back entrance, which is perfect!The concierge was so helpful too!Would stay there again."
222,2142,"Oct 22 2006 	Excellent stay	We just returned from a 6 night stay in the Radisson. At fist I was a bit sceptic because of the mixed reviews on this site. However I could not find something negativ. Check-in was at 4 pm but they let us check-in at 2 pm so we did not have to wait until 4. The room was great. It was clean, spacious and there were good facilities e.g. big (empty) fridge and a big in-room safe and coffeemaker. The staff was very hepfull and friendly. The day before we left we arranged a towncar to the airport at the conciergedesk for a fixed price of 50 dollars. Also our room was done perfect by housekeeping everyday.The location is also perfect. You exit the hotel right on Fisherman's Wharf and all restaurants are on walking distance. Also fastfood like IHOP. Johnny Rocket, SubWay etc is 2 min of a walk. Another great benefit is a large supermarket 2 blocks away on powell street. We walked to most of the attractions even Union Square we did by foot. It took about 1 hour, but on the way there you will see a lot e.g China Town. We took a 2,5 hour tour in a tourbus made from a cable car. It stops at the golden gate also for 30 min. This car is also right outside of the hotel. Also right outside the hotel is the boat that will take you to Alcatraz on Pier 33.One thing that can be influenced is the weather, but this was also great this time of year. You could walk outside till late. We felt completely safe which it also was.I would certainly stay here again. Good location, good food and nice people.TIP: take a bayarea guide which can be found in yellow boxes on the sidewalks. All information and maps are in here."
223,2142,"Oct 10 2006 	Great Location	Great location for Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, Aquatic Park. Also easy to access bus lines to China Town. Hotel is very clean and in a safe area to walk. Conceige is very helpful in providing suggestions for restaurants, attractions, car rental, bus info etc. Not a fancy hotel, but well worth the rate. Staff was very pleasant, and room was cleaned early. We have stayed there 3 times now and never been disappointed."
224,2142,"Sep 30 2006 	Great Hotel	The Radisson was just what we expected, brilliant. The staff were friendly and very accommodating. Even though we had booked a standard view room they upgraded us to a Bay View room free of charge the next day. The facilities are quite basic in that there is no restaurant or bar but we enjoyed our stay here tremendously. Very clean with friendly efficient service.The situation on Fishermans Wharf is stunning. We walked down by pier 39 at 6:00am and there is lots of activity, luxury liners being loaded with supplies. The sound of the Sea Lion colony and the gulls crying....fantastic!Don't use the highly expensive room phone to make calls though; there is a callbox just outside the reception area by the pool. Highly recommended."
225,2142,"Sep 21 2006 	Very Average	We stayed at the Radisson for two nights in mid September. The good thing about this hotel is the location to Fisherman's Wharf and if you have AAA they will waive the parking fee. There is no restaraunt in the hotel, but there are plenty of places nearby. The room was average although they have sleep number beds. With all of the choices in the wharf area I think I'd try someplace else. I know most people travel for the sights but for $200 a night I expected a little more."
226,2142,"Sep 19 2006	Disappointing holiday	I have just returned from staying in the Raddison and was not impressed, our bed was dirty and when I complained to the manager he would not come and see it and sent a bell boy insead. We were transferred to another room and offered no apology. I also object to paying 33 dollars per night for parking. I will never stay there again"
227,2142,"Sep 18 2006 	Location Location Location	If you want to be in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf and at a good price stay here. We parked our car on Friday when we got there and didn't even go back till Sunday when we left. You are walking distance from EVERYTHING!! The room is a typical room, but I typically don't go somewhere like San Francisco to sit in a hotel room. And if you are a people watcher, like my boyfriend is, then you should stand on the second floor parking lot and look over the end, you can see all of the Wharf and the people walking by. Restaurant are everywhere and so are ice cream shops :) We had a wonderful time and were even able to take a short nap in between site seeing, we were that close to everything.Only thing I have to caution you on is be VERY careful if you go through anything but the hotel because they don't hold your room, it is on a first come basis. We almost didn't get our room, which was two double bed, we were going to have to stay in the one king bed and sleep on a roll away bed. But they arranged something. Just be nice to the staff and they will take care of you."
228,2142,"Sep 12 2006	Good location	Our family stayed here in August for 3 nights, the pool was quite small and the weather not really warm enough for swimming outdoors. The room was OK but not fantastic - we paid to upgrade to a pool view. It was quiet as we were at the end of a corridor. The staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly the reception and concierge. Breakfast was just a cart in the lobby so we just visited IHOP next door! Very good location for Pier 39. Very good diner which opens into the hotel from the street. Would stay here again."
229,2142,"Aug 21 2006 	Very happy with our choice	We booked this hotel through the recommendations of our travel agent and had read some mixed reviews on here. Having just got back from a 6 night stay I thought I would add my opinion. As other people have said, the location is superb, with two entrances one right on the Wharf and the other on the main F-line system for easy transport to downtown. The room was very comfortable with a comfy (dial-a-number) bed and very clean bedding. The concierge and reservation staff were all very helpful and friendly. We would definately stay here again if we were lucky enough to be able to re-visit SF."
230,2142,"Aug 3 2006	Location can't be beat!!	Glad we chose the Radisson! I found the location to be excellent, the price to be right, and the hotel to be very accomodating! Checked in at 2 PM and our room was not ready...so we went to Johnny Rockets and returned an hour later. The room that they had assigned, was now being changed due to a guest deciding to still an additional day. So, they gave us an even better room facing the pool, with a balcony and Sleep # beds!!! I thought this hotel was very clean and well maintained!! Did I say we loved the location?! Close to EVERYTHING!!! WE even walked from China Town back to the hotel...at night...with 3 kids and never felt unsafe!! I Would stay here again!"
231,2142,"Jul 29 2006 	Great location	We (family of four) stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and could not fault it. The location was excellent with its own private access to fisherman's wharf, close tro thecable cars and lots of excellent family restaurants and cafes. The room was large enough and the staff very friendly and helpful. Following the previous comments about the rooms we emailed several days before and asked for a room overlooking the pool and this was provided - it is the best option as you do get views of the bay and Acatrax from a balcony. Some of the other rooms do overlook the street at the back and that could get noisy.Happy to recommend it."
232,2142,Jul 17 2006	Great location and experience	I can not think of one complaint. This hotel is in a fantastic location. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were large and clean. The pool was a nice quiet place to take a break and relax. We felt safe in the area and would stay at this hotel again.
233,2142,"Jul 11 2006	In the Heart of the Action	If you're going to stay right on Fisherman's Wharf, this is a good place to do it. The hotel opens directly onto the Embarcadero where all the action is, and is a short walk from most of the restaurants and attractions. Our room was nice, but not as nice as other Radissons I've stayed in. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many right outside, and the concierge was very helpful with dining recommendations, booking tour tickets, etc. The pool area is private and nice. No complaints at all, and we'd probably stay again."
234,2142,"Jul 9 2006	Good place to stay at the Wharf	Arrived for a 4 night stay at the Radisson with some intrepidation due the very mixed reviews on this site recently. But..... we had no problems. We received a friendly welcome at reception and our room was a good size (vs. British hotels) and very quiet - we were on the 2nd floor at the rear overlooking the pool and it was extremely quiet. The adjustable beds were very comfortable and the bathroom/shower facilities were completely adequate, and clean. Other than a coffee/pastry cart the hotel has no restaurant facilities, but has direct access to &quot;Johnny Rockets&quot; diner from the pool area which is great for breakfasts, and is relatively inexpensive (the waiters also entertain with the occasional dance routine when a fav tune comes on the jukebox!). There is also the more expensive IHOP (International House of Pancakes) immediately next door. This is not a chic city centre hotel by any manner of means. It is just a comfortable motel in the heart of the touristy Wharf area - probably the only place to stay in SF with young kids. All of the wharf attractions are at your doorstep and trams, buses and cablecars to any part of the city are only minutes away. We felt that $160/night was a good deal for what we got and had no complaints.Concerning the several recents comments about the unsavoury characters on the surrounding streets - I certainly have never seen more bums and vagrants on the streets in any other US city than in SF, but this does not just apply to the Wharf area. This is liberal California at its worst! However, we wandered all over the city and the Wharf at all times of day and night and had no problems. The Wharf is aimed fair and square at tourist families and it is probably safer than most areas."
235,2142,"Jul 7 2006	What's that Smell?	I think I had expected a nicer hotel because of my other Radisson experiences. This hotel had a distinct smell of stale urine in areas...including our room. The room was very small, but seemed to be clean. It just smelled...not strong, but smelled. No help was offered for baggage. On the plus, side the staff was very courteous. Parking was a self-parking garage conveniently attached to the hotel. Radisson has the sleep-number beds which are condusive to good night's sleep. The location is VERY good, because it is on Pier 39 close to many attactions and access to public transportation.Overall, I can not recommend this hotel. I think the Sheraton next door may be a better choice."
236,2142,"Jul 4 2006	Sketchy Experience	The area in which the Radisson is located in itself is sketchy. There are an excessive amount of homeless people and interesting individuals wandering around at all times during the night. It is a tourist area, however, be careful. The hotel itself was very clean. However, each night we had some different sleep interruption. One night it was knocking on the door, the next it was screaming in the parking lot, and the last it was someone calling our room phone at midnight. Possibly we just had a bad crowd, or maybe this hotel attracts a poor clientle. Whatever the case it made our stay very unenjoyable.The staff was friendly, however they didn't supply us with luggage carts which made transporting our suitcases difficult. A small selection of morning food is available for breakfast but it is highly priced and poor quality. The internet connection was a very big plus.If asked if I would stay here again, I'd have to think twice."
237,2142,"Jul 1 2006	Bay view room a must	When looking for a room this winter, I looked at so many different hotels, read many reviews. My mother had stayed at the Tuscan Inn 10 years ago and really liked it(coutyard room). I looked at the Sheraton(across the street) and chose the Radisson because the potential for a bay view room. We had four nights booked. We had a car and got free parking because we were over 50(senior discount) otherwise its $28 a night, rather pricey, something to consider. Started out in a partial bay view w/o a balcony, overlooking the pool area, but thought for the money it was not worth it. After one night we transferred to a full bay view, were quoted an extra $50 per night to change but were only charged $20. The staff was very helpful and moved all of our stuff for us. Now if you don't care about a room with a view, I might consider staying elsewhere, But when I stay at a hotel at a location where there is potential for a view-I want to see it! We had a full bay view(overlooking parking lot but I can deal with that) It was very roomy with a mini-fridge and a kingsize &quot;sleepnumber&quot; bed. We are not big breakfast eaters so the fridge came in handy to stock milk and fruit for cereal. There is a gocery store a block over(shortcut through the sheraton driveway). So at least we could save our money to spend on nice dinners! Noise from the wharf wasn't bad, everything winds down by 10-10:30(at least as far as the street performers are concerned). I loved getting up everymorning, and having my coffee and breakfast on the balcony and looking out over the bay. Now the fog on the Bay could be an issue as it was the last morning we were there so that is another thing to consider. I liked have a fitness room too because I work out everyday. I've included a couple pictures from the balcony(pictures of alcatraz from other reviews are clearer)"
238,2142,"Jun 30 2006	Radisson Hotel Fisherman's Wharf is a Fantastic Hotel	This is an excellent hotel in San Francisco. It has everything you want in a hotel. First, it has a heated pool for the very cool weather in San Francisco. Second, it has restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It has a Johnny Rocket's and it has an IHOP inside of it. It also has a very small fitness room. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and the place was very clean. The room we had was average size, but the balcony in most of the rooms have an incredible view of the bay and alcatraz island. The beds were very comfortable with the Sleep Number beds and the room was very clean. The best thing about the hotel was the great location in fisherman's wharf. It is very close to Pier 39 which is the most popular place in san francisco and it is near lots of restaurants all up the wharf. Also, it is close to ghirardelli square. Altogether, this was a great hotel to stay for families and tourists."
239,2142,"Jun 8 2006	great location	we loved the location of this hotel. It is very convenient to the attractions. The Pier 39 was our favorite. This hotel was closest compared to other hotels. Everything is walking distance except for Union Square, but we only went there for a couple of hours. We biked the Golden Gate. When we first arrived in our non-smoking room, it smelled of stale smoke. We told the front desk and they quickly gave us a new room and apologized. The new room smelled fine. The hotel is older but it is what you pay for. We paid $130 through hotels.com. The street noise was heard during the day but it was no problem at night. The bed and sheets were very comfortable. The shower had some mildew but not repulsive. We would definately stay here again."
240,2142,"Jun 2 2006	Loved it but the plumbing!	As other reviews, great location, very good hotel, clean, roomy and great staff. The only small annoyance (hope i am not being picky) was when another room used there tap, shower etc the water pipes made a lot of noise. apart from that a great hotel at the price.Also if you do stay here and fancy a good drink go to &quot;Tierans&quot; (spelling may be off) a irish bar near the cable car turn is a great place for a bite to eat and a drink. Live music every night and great staff.Popmpei Grotto on the wharf also do great food.We stayed for four nights and found all of fishermans wharf very safe. we were walking around after midnight every night and we looked every part the tourist's. Tip: cable cars get very busy try to go off peak or not at weekends if your stay will allow.Tip: Alcatraz, book tickets before you go, when we went they had sold out 5 days in advance. people were waiting in stand by Q's"
241,2142,May 29 2006	Good location good price good hotel	First impressions of this hotel are that it is a bit dated. This is if you see it from Fisherman's wharf where it looks like something out of the 1970's.However when you get inside it is a good hotel for a good price. This is not 5 star luxury but is clean and comfortable with good amenities. The rooms have good internet connectivity which is provided for free with in room safes. The bathrooms are clean with a reasonable shower. The best thing about this hotel is the location seconds from all the attractions and restaurants at Fishermans wharf. The lack of proper restaurant facilities in the hotel is made up by the selection of places to eat in the location. If you are visiting for a holiday or short break this is an ideal hotel.
242,2142,"May 18 2006	Overpriced and the area is really rough	I didn't read any reviews about this hotel as we stayed here unexpectedly on a tour type holiday. We decided we wanted an extra night in San Fran as we didn't think we'd fit it all in in 2 days.After stopping at a few of the hotels on the Wharf, we settled on the Radisson maily because I was getting fed up looking (long drive) and it was one of the cheapest we had asked at (Hilton, Sheraton, Holiday Inn etc).The check in staff were great and our room was huge, as was the bathroom, it was also clean, so no complaints there.Basically we got what we paid for and as it was only for one noght that was fine.The only thing I would say is that Fishermans Wharf during the day is just about okay, with Pier 39 being the best bit. But when we stepped out at night I felt really unsafe and it looks very seedy and cheap. So much so we went back to our room.Maybe I'm being unfair on the hotel scoring, as it was Fishermans Wharf I hated.Would I recommend it, yes if you want to stay right on the Wharf, it was good value for money. Would I go back, never again would I go to Fishermans Wharf!"
243,2142,"May 14 2006	Pleasantly Surprised!	Having read the various earlier reports on this hotel, we arrived with geat apprehension after a long flight from UK via LA. Pleading tiredness, we aked for a quiet room and were immediately allocated one on the top floor and at the end of one of the wings. Consequently it was well away from any noise and actually gave us a partial view over the bay. The room itself was clean and perfectly adequate - the inflatable mattress was fun to play with! That said, we achieved our quiet stay at the expense of a route march to/from the ice machine or, even further, to the elevators. However, it was certainly worth it as we were well away from the numerous school/youth parties that the hotel seems to specialise in. Undoubtedly they would make for a noisier stay in a more central room. The parties also seemed to have agreements with the iHop for breakfasts, so we preferred either the danish/coffee option in the lobby or the Johnny Rockets, which was extremely convenient and good value, even providing impromptu song/dance routines by its waiting staff! Additionally, the nearby Safeway store is very handy for stocking the in-room fridge with wine, etc. Above all, it's a question of location, location, location! This hotel is difficult to beat on those grounds, the staff are all extremely polite and helpful, and the rooms are perfectly acceptable, if not luxurious. Well worth considering for a few days in the City."
244,2142,May 2 2006	Radisson...wonderful	Very friendly and helpful staff. Wonderful room. Sleep Number Beds are the best.Great View. Close to everything. I would highly recommend the Radisson.
245,2142,"Apr 25 2006	Great location Hotel could do better	After a great stay in March 2005, we decided to stay again in the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights in April 2006. Although the location is superb we found a had a few issue's this time. Check in was stressful (room not ready in time) 1 towel in our room (family of 4), constant noise all through the night (doors banging ect). Don't be fooled by this hotel being the closest to pier 39 because any hotel in the fisherman's wharf area is a great base for your vacation."
246,2142,"Apr 18 2006	An OK place to stay	An excellent location for a whistle stop stay in SF I had read many of the reviews about this hotel before I booked so I went with an open mind. As we were only in SF for 3nights we needed a hotel on the spot and this hotel was just that. On the advise of other reviews I requested a room over looking the pool area which we got, then we didn't have views over the car park so that would be my recommendation. After the 10 hours flight from the UK all we wanted was a clean and comfort bed for the night and that is exactly what we got. Yes the walls were a little thin and you could hear your neighbours but nothing to cause us any problems. The direct access to Fishermans Wharf also proved to be a bonus. Ihop next door was fine for breakfast but not alot else. I found staff to be polite and helpful. I would recommend this hotel because of it's location, apart from that is was an OK nothing special sort of place."
247,2142,"Apr 7 2006	Ask for a Bay View - in advance	Well we had read all the good/bad/terrible reports on this Hotel before we booked so some things we found wern't a total surprise.1. Fantastic Location - walkthrogh to FW very useful.2. I emailed the Hotel a couple of days prior to arival and asked for a Bay view room - which we got. In hindsight I should have asked for a 3rd floor room as this floor is totally non smoking.We had no problem with noise.I did ask for a no smoking room - which we got -but on the 4th floor - which also has smoking rooms - so this makes the corridors smell.3. Yes, the carpets/decor are a little dated, but our room was clean, and the bathroom very nice.4. No food/restaurant - we went to both the IHOP and Johny Rockets which are attached - we found IHOP slow and expensive when compared to Johny Rockets which was good. There are pleny of other places to eat nearby.5. Front desk and consierge both very helpful.6. Pool and gym both OK - but with so much to do in SF how long are you going to be in there?"
248,2142,"Apr 7 2006	Is this the noisiest Hotel in San Francisco?	No doubt about it, the location of this hotel is fab - with direct access to Fisherman's Wharf and all it's great amenities. However, the hotel itself was very disappoiting. The room was clean and well decorated but was very small - there was hardly enough space to put up the ironing board! If you are looking forward to a good nights sleep at this hotel, then forget about it! The walls are so thin you can hear everything from the rooms next to you, above you &amp; below you - voices, the T.V, hairdryers etc.. and the noise the plumbing makes is unbelievable. If you are unlucky enough to have a room overlooking the road, be prepared for the constant noise of traffic and the regular rubbish vans and delivery trucks that arrive from about 4.00am, leaving their engines running for ages.In summary, loved Fisherman's Wharf and San Francisco but would not recommend this hotel."
249,2142,"Apr 6 2006	Great Location! O.K Hotel	We stayed at this hotel March - April 2006. The Location was fantastic, with a good view of Alcatraz from our second floor room. The rooms however were slightly shabby but nevertheless clean. The ihop next door was great for breakfast and the check in staff were pleasant and courteous. Average hotel in a great central area."
250,2142,"Apr 1 2006	Absolutely Fabulous	This was our first trip to San Francisco and unsure where to stay. The hotel was very nice for the money 99 per night, had excellent views and was clean and quiet. Fishermans wharf offered a safe place with much to do in the evening. Nearby were many dining options in all price ranges. Transportation to pretty much anywhere you would want to go was within a few blocks, most could be reached within one block. The hotel staff and conceirge were very helpful. Don't miss Alcatraz or Johnny Rockets, both were great fun.One tip if you go to haight ashbury(great for us old hippies) do not go into golden gate park at the end of Haight it is the &quot;back entrance&quot; we later discovered nicknamed dealer heaven! Very scarry even in broad daylight!"
251,2142,"Mar 27 2006	NOT 4 stars!!	The check-in process was quick at least..The first room we checked into had a horrible smell, I mean BAD like something dead. Even the maid (who was in the room even though we were given the keys) was holding her nose and saying &quot;BAD SMELL IN HERE WON'T GO AWAY&quot;...the decor was very ratty..we called down and were immediately given another room. It was obvious that the first room was much older and in an older wing of hotel. Thankfully, the 2nd room was better and seemed cleaner. It was very noisy all night, and the blow dryer was broken. There was a light that was flickering loudly in the bathroom, we requested that the bulb be replaced the first night we were there, that never happened. The 2nd morning we were awakened at 6am by the maid cleaning the room upstairs, thumping around and moving furniture for 45 minutes. It was awful. The pool was closed for service, something that we should have been told PRIOR to our arrival. They did offer to let guests use a pool at another hotel (very inconvenient). I will say that we only paid $125 thru an online site, so it wasn't the normal $225 per night charge at least!! The parking was $40 per night, OUCH. I won't be staying at this place again. WAY too loud and not at all worth the $225+ taxes and fees. The location is great, but the noise problems and the low budget rooms are not at all worth dealing with."
252,2142,Mar 15 2006	Great Location!	Stayed here for 3 nights in February. The location was great for Fisherman's Wharf - restaurants and shops. The room was clean and tidy but I would have to agree with the comments about the noise. Our room overlooked the main street outside and it was very busy and sometimes delivery trucks would arrive by about 6am and run their engines for ages while you try to drift back to sleep! I would also have to agree with the comments about going out after dark around the streets by the hotel. You are fine around Fisherman's Wharf but don't venture any further around as the streets are deserted and not much street lighting. Great restaurants around the area and a fantastic pancake restaurant right on the corner which did great breakfasts.
253,2142,"Mar 12 2006	It's Fine!!	Stayed for 4 nights from 1st - 4th March. Our room, on the third floor, overlooked the car park but you could see the top of Coit Tower and the waterfront from it.Room had a huge bed and was fine, not the largest but quite adequate. Hotel was quiet and we slept well.It's position is fantastic, walk through the rear walkway and directly onto the wharf, short stroll to Pier 39, the f-line is almost outside and thr tram car stop if a five-ten minute walk away.Breakfast can be got at either McDonalds, Ihop or other small cafes within a short stroll.Staff were helpful and basically it all went well, I'd happily stay again."
254,2142,"Mar 11 2006 	Radisson should be ashamed	Noisyest hotel we have ever encountered. This one was really bad and we have been everywhere. Don't plan on getting any sleep. Make sure you get a courtyard room as they have the only views. You can watch people smoke on the other balconys. If you lean out over the balcony rail you can just see Alcatraz over a parking garage. The desk clerk gave us the courtyard because she said the street facing rooms were noisy. I can't imagine. The courtyard carried the Alcatraz decorating theme. The room carpets were burned, stained and ragged. Should have been replaced 10 years ago. Bathroom had something growing behind the door. I guess they don't clean behind the door cause nobody looks there anyway. Location is good but there are better places in the same location. Checkin and security staff were very nice. Checkout clerk was rude and sarcastic. When I asked for our paperwork he said that there weren't any charges and that if there were he wouldn't tell us anyway. Go figure. We aren't whiners or complainers and are really very easy going but this pushed us over the edge. Loved SF but would stay at another hotel even if it cost more."
255,2142,"Feb 26 2006	Good hotel great price great locatoin	You should stay here because of the location. After dark, street people come out &amp; it's very scaring. Radisson Hotel has direct walking path to Fisherman's Wharf. Other Hotel's are located one or two blocks away and families should NOT be on side streets at dark. Our hotel rooms were on the second floor, very old and had dirty carpets, so they moved us to the four floor which were cleaner and a quietier floor. Staff were very nice and helpful."
256,2142,"Feb 26 2006	Freindly Staff Nice Room Nice Location	We stayed six nights here. Everything was fine. The room was clean, the staff was friendly, the location is lovely. Right by the bay. The courtyard/pool area is also very nice. You are right in the middle of the Wharf area, right on the F Muni line. If you don't mind how touristy it is, this is a nice area. A lot of the local bars and restaurants shut down around 9 or 10, at least this time of year. If you want to be out dining and drinking until 2 am, the Union Square area might be more for you.But this hotel is very nice."
257,2142,"Feb 26 2006	Beds to sleep.....	The hotel has just introduced new electric operated beds. You can adjust the firmness of the bed to your own comfort. If you get a queens size bed,both people can choose the own stiffness. Great after a hard days site seeing."
258,2142,"Feb 23 2006	Great location	Stayed here for 2 nights. Had read other reviews which recommended requesting a room overlooking the pool - how right they were!! We made the request and had a great room on the 3rd floor which not only looked over the pool, but when you stand on the balcony you also had a great view of the Bay and Alcatraz. Hotels which are on the outside of the hotel don't have balconies either!! You can pay to upgrade to a Bay view room - these are at the ends of the hotel and directly face the bay - not really worth the extra as they also overlook the carpark.Room had 2 double beds and had plenty of room for all our baggage. The bathroom was also a good size. There was a small stall in the reception which sold fruit, coffee etc but if you want a real American Breakfast there is an IHOP just next door - gets quite busy but the food and service were great. There is a small 7/11 grocery store around the corner or if you cross over the road and go up the hill a short distance you will find a Safeway. Its also not too far to walk to the old tram stop up to Union Square for a bit of shopping!The hotel has its own entrance directly onto the Wharf area which is really handy as the main entrance to the hotel is on Beach St which runs parallel behind the main wharf area.Check-in/out was good and really quick with friendly staff - no long queues as we had when we've stayed at other hotels in the area.This was a really good overall hotel and if we go back to San Francisco, we shall definately stay there again."
259,2142,"Feb 6 2006	Excellent location but room needs to be updated	This hotel's greatest asset is its location. Very convenient access door to Fisherman's Wharf &amp; centrally located to all lines of transportation. However the room was not inviting - the carpet needed to be replaced, the bathroom tile floor needed to be shined &amp; there was a musty smell in the hallway. Room was very plain &amp; small for three guests (2 adults/1 toddler)."
260,2142,"Jan 26 2006	Friendly Staff Average Hotel Great Location!	This hotel wasn't a four seasons or anything, but it was perfectly adequate to relax, sleep, and have quick access to all of the major sites of San Francisco. The staff was incredibly friendly and made it a point to help us as best as they could. We had no problems at all with the staff or the accomodations. The only thing I would do to make this hotel better would be to add a bar, lounge, or small cafe so that we could have grabbed a quick drink in the hotel. Other than that, it was perfectly fine!"
261,2142,"Jan 18 2006	Its alright	This hotel was alright but not great. We were in a room with no view and then we got upgraded to one that had a view but the room was more bunted. The toilet overflowed :( they came and fixed it kinda fast but i would have preferred not to overflow. The beds were alright, tv had a good picture and the ice machince was kind of far away. They had a nice pool and lobby area but no restaurant however there was a johnny rockets next door among other places. When youre a guest you have a special walkway to fishermans wharf. The hotel is close to alot of things we walked to the tram place and got a tram to union square. At night time watch the street people near the bins with braches its funny they jump out and scare people as a joke."
262,2142,"Jan 14 2006	Helpful staff ideal location - hard to beat.	We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids - 14 &amp; 15) travelling on a budget and had been squeezed into some small rooms, but the receptionist took pity and put us into a much bigger room than we had booked. OK it overlooked a carpark, but if you want a view - it's a 1 minute walk to the harbour. The concierge gave us lots of helpful advice, and for the price of a taxi when we were leaving, booked us a limo which gave us a tour of the surrounding hills on the way to the airport.It might not be the most modern or luxurious hotel, but it was clean and comfortable. And as everybody has said, you can't fault the location."
263,2142,"Jan 3 2006	SF trip - November 2005	My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Radisson on Fisherman's Wharf in November. We had booked a king size room the first night, but switched to a room with double beds the remaining nights. The king size room was facing the street and was tiny. After we moved to the room with double beds we had a view of the bay (also the room and bathroom seemed more spacious). The refrigerator was a nice feature. The hotel is only a block off the bayfront which was nice. You have to walk through the courtyard and then thru a long hallway which opens out to the sidewalk. For breakfast everyday we picked up pastries at the Safeway store (1 block south of hotel - be sure and get the discount card). That was real handy for drinks and snacks. The rooms were cleaned daily and I didn't really hear to much noise in the hallways. The hotel was convenient to bus lines plus there were several restaurants within walking distance. We really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again."
264,2142,"Dec 22 2005	I read all the reviews still booked it but wouldn't again	Well I did all my research, read the reviews good and bad about the Raddison on Fishermans Wharf, and thought I'd give it a chance on the basis of &quot;It's a Raddison, it can't be that bad!&quot;In summary, I wouldn't stay there again - but it didn't ruin my stay in fantastic San Francisco.Having looked at all the hotel choices on the Wharf, I'd recommend only one - &quot;The Argonaut&quot; - looks great and is directly opposite the cable car turnaround.First of all, for location, it cannot be beat. It is opposite the Pier's and in the middle of all the Fishermans Wharf action.Having stayed there, it really has a 70's Motel feel about it. The building is really dated, and seems more suited to cars than guests, with all the concrete and many of the rooms overlooking the parking lot! (I mean cars park directly outside your room window)There is no bar, breakfast room or restaurant at the hotel. Upon asking reception why, they say that everything you need is around the hotel at Fishermans Wharf. For dinner, I'd agree. For breakfast I can say that it was a problem. There is an IHOP (International House of Pancakes) next to the hotel that serves breakfast, tried it once and wouldn't return. It took quite some time to locate places serving breakfast. We ended-up most days walking to the west end of the wharf near the cable car turnaround, about eight blocks. There is a development called the &quot;Cannery&quot;. It is a large brick building with The Argonaut on one side and shops on the other. There is a cafe/bar on the ground floor that serves a great breakfast. Also, &quot;Boudins&quot; opposite the hotel has a coffee and danish bar and there is a Starbucks a couple of blocks away. There is also a coffee cart in reception that serves muffins and drinks etc.The room furnishings are relatively new. The sleepmaster beds are sold as a big feature, but a gimmick in my opinion.We changed rooms on the first night as couldn't sleep due to the noise of the TV in an adjacent room at 1am. The walls are quite thin I think. The staff were quite responsive and gave me another room.Finding your room will be fun! It is like walking in a hall of mirrors! Really long corridors and they all look the same!In summary, I'd say that you can't trust the brand name to deliver you a certain standard of hotel. I certainly feel let down that I trusted the name of Raddison, after staying with them countless times in other places in the world."
265,2142,"Dec 19 2005	Lost shoes in hotel	I stayed at Radisson Fisherman Wharf two nights in Aug. 05 with my family. Our experience has been negative: in comparison with American hotels standard, the quality/price ratio is very low, rooms are very small and the queen size beds are less comfortable than those of any other inn. But what I found incredible is the professionalism of the staff, considering the level of the hotel. The first night, just arrived in America, we forgot a pair of shoes in the room; the second night we moved to a different room in the same hotel but no one said us anything about it. Just left the hotel, we realized the fact and we called the hotel asking whether they had found the shoes, but they answered they hadnt. Its hard to believe that, if someone finds a pair of shoes, doesnt inform the staff!!"
266,2142,"Dec 15 2005	Location Location Location	Hotels in San Francisco can certainly be hit or miss. Like all great cities, neighborhood location should be a chief prerequisite for a hotel selection. If you want shopping, stay in Union Square. If you are in town on business, stay in the Financial District. If you want high-end, shoot for Nob Hill. If you want a solid tourist experience, head for the wharf.The Radisson is certainly not attractive from the exterior. The hotel's parking garage is two levels and &quot;wraps&quot; around the hotel so you may have a room facing the front grill of a large SUV. Very few of the rooms have views but be sure to ask for one. Some public areas are on the shabby end of the scale but the rooms are very clean and quite comfortable and honestly, who goes to San Francisco to hang out in their hotel lobby?My wife and I had a king room with one of those &quot;select comfort&quot; air mattress beds. The only thing king about the room was the bed. It appears that when the hotel was last remodeled, they may have expanded the bathroom into the closet to make it larger. Losing the closet meant adding a huge armoire for the television with two small side cabinets for hanging clothes. The size of the armoire takes up quite a bit of the room.The room itself was very nicely apportioned - tiled bathroom, a nice writing desk, a feather duvet and a choice of feather or foam pillows for the aforementioned sleep number bed - I discovered I'm a 35 by the way. Overall the stay was lovely.Some previous reviews knocked the hotel for its lack of amenities. Honestly, this is San Francisco - with a quick walk you can be in the thick of it on the wharf or in a taxi or on a cable car headed elsewhere in the city for shopping, eating, drinking, etc. The only time spent at your hotel here should be for sleeping!"
267,2142,"Nov 22 2005	You cant beat the location.	We booked three nights at the Radisson, Fishermans Wharf as part of a holiday around the west of the USA. You really cant beat the location of this hotel. It is right on the wharf. Pier 39 and the Alcatraz boat dock are moments away. You of course pay a slight premium for this, but we felt it was well worth it.The service was great also and check-in was fine. We did have a slight technical problem with our TV, I called down to reception and within about two minutes the maintenance man was there to deal with the problem  very efficient. The rooms were in excellent condition, although the dcor was a pretty standard affair. We booked a standard room, but we put a request for a bay view, this was granted and we could see Alcatraz from our room. There are some very mixed reviews on this website. We honestly didnt find the place dirty or smelly. You really cant beat the location of this hotel."
268,2142,Nov 21 2005	Great location but shabby	Originally we were going to stay 5 nights at this hotel but having checked in on the first night we changed our minds. The location is fantastic but the hotel is so dated and shabby in some areas. There is no bar in the hotel so you cannot sit and have a drink. We stayed at the Marriot hotel for the remainder which was brilliant - the beds are so comfortable and the rooms large airy and nicely decorated.
269,2142,"Nov 13 2005	Great Location - Defintely would stay again!!	My husband and I stayed at the Radisson in Sept 2005 for 4 nights. Our room was on the 4th floor and had the sleep by number bed - it was great! When we looked out our window we could see part of the Pier and Alcatraz. Our room was large and clean. The location is the best on the Wharf, only two blocks from Pier 39. We returned our rental car before we stayed due to how expensive parking is on the Wharf - $30/day. I see alot of reviewers have complained about the noise, we did NOT hear any during our stay. The Boudin Bakery is just across the street from the Radisson - very good sourdough bread and meals. There is a Trader Joe's 2 blocks away from the Wharf to get any snacks or two buck chuck (cheap wine - it is decent for only $2/bottle). Alcatraz is very cool to tour. We purchased our tickets on line for $16/each - it included the boat ride and the audio tour on the island. It is very interesting and worth it. From the Radisson the ferry dock is only a block away - so once again a very convienent location!! The only negative to this hotel would be the conciege lady was rather rude and elevators are a little slow. But that was very minor with such a great location. Before getting to Fisherman's Wharf, we had driven to Monterey and Muir Woods National Monument. Monterey Aquarium is HUGE and one of the best in the country. It is defintely worth the trip. Muir Woods is also very cool to hike around in, the Redwoods are over 1,000 years old. We were glad we drove ourselves, the tour buses of people were very loud at the park. If you go to Muir Woods a rental car can be rented for a day from Fisherman's Wharf (dollar rental car and budget) - get to Muir Woods early to explore before the tour buses arrive.All in all the Radisson was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to others!!"
270,2142,"Nov 10 2005	We left after just 1 night	We stayed at the Radisson in June this year.Originaly we had booked for 3 nights, but after 1 night we left and checked into the Sheraton just across the road.The rooms were small and not very clean. The beds were some of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. And the street noise meant that you got very little sleep.Worst of all, we were woken at 7am by workmen on the roof directly above us. When we telephoned reception to ask what the noise was, their response was &quot;what time will you be leaving the room?&quot;.We decided very quickly that we wouldnt be spending more than one night there, and when we told reception that we were checking out they did show some concern.They even brought the manager out to speak to us, but he wasnt interested in hearing about the problems we had experienced - he just told us to write to head office.The Sheraton on the other hand were fantastic - they let us check into the hotel at 9am so that we could get a few hours sleep before we went out to explore the city.Strange how two hotels right next to each other can be so different."
271,2142,"Nov 6 2005	Need a serious makeover	Great location by the wharves, on arrival given a small room by the lift on the 2nd floor, on return from handing the rental car back, went to the front desk and complained about the room, very helpful guy at the desk moved us to large room on the 4th floor but with a corner view of the bay and the piers. The hotel could do with a serious makeover, everything is shabby and the corridors smelled. I noted on the last day a plaque in reception stating that this hotel is not a Raddison but affiliated to the Raddison group, I have stayed in Raddissons around the world and found them to be smart, clean and very scandinavian in their approach and decor. This one was, one up from a local motel. Not what I expected, value for money? Not really its the location you pay for!"
272,2142,"Nov 5 2005	Pleasant stay with no problems	My husband and I and his parents stayed in two rooms at the Radisson for 3 nights from 20.10.2005. We had no complaints about our rooms. They were clean and spacious. They has a connecting door but no problems with noise travelling from next door (unlike one of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip). All in all we found this hotel clean, reasonably priced for the area and staff were pleasant. Yes you have to pay $30 per night for parking and if we had not been travelling after San Francisco then we would not have bothered with a car as you really do not need one in San Francisco. We walked everywhere or took cable cars. With regard to previous complaint re smoking rooms - in our party of 4 we had 3 smokers and we booked non-smoking rooms - we had no problem going to the roof top parking or front door if we wanted a smoke (we really weren't in rooms long enough for it to be a problem and as SF is non-smoking anyway you have to do this when you are out for meals or drinks all the time). We saw smoking rooms but cannot say there was any noticeable odour around these rooms. Our only complaint about this hotel was that there was no bar/restaurant on the premises and therefore had to go out for a drink when we first arrived. We all would stay in this hotel again."
273,2142,"Oct 23 2005	Happy with the Radisson	Stayed at the Radisson in October and were very happy with the hotel and, especially, the location. Surprised at some of the other reports regarding the rooms. Maybe we were just lucky but our room was clean, comfortable and of a good standard. Loved being able to step out of the back of the hotel straight on to Fisherman's Wharf. Found all the staff helpful, no problems on that front. Only fly in the ointment was our trip back to the Airport. Radisson use &quot;Airport Express&quot; transfers and our journey was a disaster. The van was highly overloaded and, in our opinion, dangerously so, with luggage in with the passengers as well as stacked to the roof in the back. The trip took well over an hour due to stopping at five hotels and the driver having to constantly juggle the luggage to fit it all in. We had used &quot;Lorries&quot; transfers for 3 trips previously and had no problems at all with them. Radisson - please note for future reference!"
274,2142,"Oct 23 2005	Very nice hotel in a great location.	We just returned from a four night stay at the Radisson-Fisherman's Wharf. Overall, we enjoyed the stay at this hotel. We had a room on the third floor with a balcony and king sized bed. We did have a nice view of the bay but also of the top level of their parking lot. Our room was very clean and nice, but the inefficient use of space made the room smaller than it really is. For example the front edge of the TV cabinet is about a foot from the edge of the bed. We had to use this &quot;walkway&quot; quite often to get from the bathroom side of the room to the balcony and desk side. There is decent space once you enter the room but you really can't put any luggage there because the bathroom door swings out and takes up that space. The room had a safe, coffee maker, iron and board, hair dryer, extra pillow and blanket. The room was cleaned very well every day by their housekeeping staff. The climate control unit worked very well and was quiet. We did like the bed and thought the number control settings worked well. The water pressure was very good and had no problems with the water temperature. At certain times of the day, the elevator was slow. Quite suprisingly, when using the two main elevators (adjacent to each other), we had to press their own respective buttons. So if you're in the lobby waiting for the elevator, you need to press the &quot;up&quot; button for each of the two elevators individually (same for when you are on an upper floor, you need to &quot;call&quot; for each of the two elevators to go down). I used their fitness center 3 out of the 4 morinings. It's not a full facility, but rather one long narrow room consisting of cardiovascular machines and a multi-station weight lifting machine. It served it's purpose well but if there's more than 3 people in there it definitely will feel crowded. Although we didn't really need the concierge for anything major, more often than not we couldn't find him/her. Convenience to the Wharf area is the hotel's strong point. There is an IHOP on the street level where we had breakfast on a couple of mornings. The deli/tequeria around the other corner is a good (and cheaper) alternative for breakfast. Overall, we did enjoy our stay - clean room, comfortable bed and bedding, nice bath accessories, great view of the bay. A few quirks kept this from being a totally excellent experience. We flew into SFO earlier in the week, rented a car from Hertz to drive out to Yosemite for a couple of days, returned the car at the Hertz about three blocks away from the hotel. You won't need a car in the city, besides the hotel charges approximately $30/day for parking."
275,2142,"Oct 16 2005	Smelly dirty overpriced	The location of this motel is the only thing we found positive. My husband smokes and we could tell where the smoking rooms were immediately upon leaving the elevator. They do not neutralize or make any effort to fight the smell. The room was dirty, the air conditioner vent was clogged with dust, cobwebs and smoke residue. The smell was so strong, I walked 4 blocks to buy Fabreeze. The smoking rooms also were not given the sleep number mattresses that the motel brags they have in all rooms. Very disappointed in this overpriced motel. On site parking was expensive, especially when staying 4 nights, $30 a night. What a racket. they also do not respond to complaints, If you are staying in San Francisco-stay away from this motel. Or at the very least, don't admit to being a smoker."
276,2142,"Oct 12 2005	Can't wait to go back!!!!	We stayed at the Radisson for two nights in September. What a wonderful stay. The rooms were clean and comfortable. They weren't really big, but who cares. We were out sight-seeing, shopping and having fun. Why would you want to spend all your time in your room when you are in San Francisco? What was even better then the clean comfortable rooms, the great staff and the wonderful location was the view. I got to wake up each morning to a straight shot out to Alcatraz. I would stay at this hotel again because of several reasons, the most being the convient location to anywhere you would want to go in the city."
277,2142,"Oct 11 2005	Really Dissapointed	We kicked off our honeymoon here, we wanted the location and a really nice hotel. The website looked great- Raddison have a good reputation- However I think this must be the worst hotel in their chain. The rooms are old, wallpaper falling off the walls, the cupboard doors broken and the general decor of the room was depressing. If I was to return I'd look at the holiday inn express about 100m down the road. Avoid this hotel."
278,2142,"Oct 8 2005	Do a Renovation NOW	The desk staff save one member, their manager are stroppy and very terse with guests. The hotel is so old it doesn't deserve to have the Radisson name UNLESS they renovate the room -- SOON!! It is like a 1960's dive hotel you'd see on the Streets of San Francisco -- basic room, bed chair, no free internet. Avoid and stay at a slightly better property a bit more into towne."
279,2142,"Oct 3 2005	Not crazy about this hotel	This is an old, somewhat dumpy hotel. The lobby is very plain, our room was very small and the hallways smelled kind of musty. And it really wasn't cheap. I checked several sources and could not find a great deal. I ended up paying about 170/night - I should have spent more $ to stay in Union Square. There was one super-nice staff member who gave us a night of free parking. The concierge was good, too.But honestly, the company could dig into their pockets and remodel this place a bit. I would not stay there again.By the way, if you go to North Beach, do NOT go to Trattoria Pinocchio (or Cafe Pinocchio, or whatever it was called). The food was terrible. I can't believe these places that tout their great chefs, but then they don't use fresh ingredients or season their food! Total waste of $."
280,2142,"Sep 28 2005	Radisson Fisherman's Wharf - Great location Great Value	We just got back from a week in San Francisco and had a wonderful time despite the cool weather. The Radisson, Fisherman's Wharf is an excellent value. If you're looking for 'touristy' then this is perfect. It's located right in the middle of the Fisherman's Wharf area. If you want to go on a city tour the departure point is right across the street. If you want to go to Alcatraz you only have to walk about 200 yards. Pier 39, complete with sea lions, is about a 5 minute walk, there are two cable car turn arounds within a 5 minute walk and the F-line street cars go right by the door.The Radisson isn't fancy but the rooms are clean and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Try to get a bay view room on an upper floor if possible. The noise from the street at the front of the hotel is significant especially when a bus pulls up and idles while letting passengers on and off. We know, we had one, we asked to be moved and were.Lots of reviewers have raved about the beds. They are air beds which you can inflate or deflate to your personal comfort. They do take a little getting used to though. Your first night might not be great.There's no restaurant or dining room in the hotel but there is lots of food within a short walk. The concierge at the hotel is very friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to booking tours or any other need that you may have.As this isn't intended to be a travelogue on San Fran but a review of the Radisson all I would like to say about SF is that a tour of the city is a great way to start, the trip to Alcatraz is very worthwhile and if you're going to be in town for a few days and will be relying of public transit, buy a 3 day pass for the MUNI system. The pass covers everything - cable cars (which are $5 per ride if you pay the single fare), the F-line, buses and subway. It's worth the $18 for the three day pass.I'd like to thank all the other Tripadvisor[-] reviewers who posted their remarks which greatly helped me decide on the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf. I'll happily receive and respond to emails inquiring about specific topics."
281,2142,"Sep 12 2005	Great location	We stayed at the Radisson for four nights at the beginning of september. The location is great, just across the road from the harbour, piers etc, and various food outlets. Only a short walk to the cable cars. The hotel staff on reception were helpful, the room adequate but nothing special. Our room had a balcony from where we had a view of the pool, harbour and Alcatraz. The location was excellent but the hotel average."
282,2142,"Sep 8 2005	Great location nice hotel helpful staff	we staed at the Radisson for 4 nights at the end of august.Chose it because of Fishermans Wharf location and it was really great. You cannot beat the location, whenver we came back from downtown or tours we loved the area.Fishermans Whard, Pier 39 and ferryboats are just across the street.Staff was always very helpful. Rooms are Ok if you do not expect 5 star quality, hotel is more of Motel style.Make sure you get a room with a pool view, because they have a nice view towards Bay and alcatraz. There are also rooms with street view (must be loud) and rooms with a view to the innercourt with parking lot (there you hear cars moving all day).We had a great room with Bay view.The pool in the innercourt is heated and nice. Cafes and reataurant just around the corner."
283,2142,"Aug 27 2005	Perfect location and great service	We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf.Location was the selling point of this hotel. The back entrance led us right into all the activities of the piers. The front entrance and we were steps away from IHOP and right on Beach street. Exit by the pool and we were in Johnny Rockets or Ben and Jerrys Ice cream shop. Stairs at the side entrance(next to our room) led to a 7Eleven for morning coffee and newspaper. Just a perfect location for getting to the piers, the Cannery, Giradelli square.We walked alot (to burn calories from all the food!)easy walk to China town, lil Italy,Fort Mason park and Lombard Street from the hotel. Service was exceptional at the hotel. Had requested a refridg. in the room when I booked the trip. At checkin I asked if we had one, they had not put one in the room. By the time we got checked in and to the room with our luggage someone was there with refridg.ALL hotel employees were friendly and helpful. One night we had a problem with the shower. Called the front desk and under 5 minutes they were there and fixed the shower. Had room service, but we never used it. Maid service was excellent. Only negative I can think of was the carpet in the room seemed a little worn and stained. Besides that the room was clean and adequate size.Only time we were in the room was to shower or sleep so a worn carpet really made no difference. I'd say the main plus was the location. Would absolutely stay there again!"
284,2142,"Aug 24 2005	Can't Beat This Hotel in SF	Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel. Originally booked at another location, but got a last minute deal on this hotel on the Radisson website. Excellent choice. Location directly across from Alcatraz ticket booth and Pier 39 is unrivaled! Rooms were great - clean, roomy, comfortable . . . and most have a bayview. Parking was also great. Staff at this hotel were exceptional. They were able to meet all of our requests and were very helpful. Highly recommend this Radisson. Have fun!!!"
285,2142,"Aug 23 2005	Fabulous hotel... wonderful location!	My fiance and I just returned from a wonderful weekend getaway in San Francisco. The hotel staff members at the Radisson were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean, and the decor was cute and modern. The bed was the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in... it was a Sleep Number bed. The location of the hotel could not have been any more perfect... the wharf is 1/2 a block from the hotel, &quot;Little Italy&quot; is a few blocks away, Ghiradelli Square is a short walk, and the cable car stations are close as well. Be sure to bring warm clothes though... average temp. year-round is around 63 degrees."
286,2142,"Aug 23 2005	A nice hotel in an excellent location	This hotel was in an ideal location if you want to visit Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. This area is ideal for all ages and has plenty of activities to fill your trip.The hotel is rather basic. The rooms are quite small (we were in a quad) and decor rather plain. However the hotel was clean and had facilities such as a swimming pool. Staff are pleasant and willing to offer assistance.We arrived at the hotel at 4pm-check in time. There were long queues from new guests and many of the rooms still were not ready. We did get a room within half an hour though.It is located right on the front, s is perfect for visiting Pier 39, Alcatraz and the chocolate factory. Two of the tram lines are nearby, so it is very easy to visit Union Square and the Grey Line terminal is across the road, so if you want to take a trip out of the city then you don't need to go far to catch a bus!This is a good hotel if you are on a budget and want to see SF. Do not expect any luxuries- but the location helps you get over that."
287,2142,"Aug 21 2005	Stay was most pleasant	Just returned from SFO and staying at the Radisson- our room was a good size however the double beds were quite uncomfortable. When checking out the agent said we should have tried a king room as they have the new, adjustable ones.Location is great- close to shopping and attractions. We couldn't get confirmed tickets for Alcatraz so stood by for the 0930 departure and got on!! Overall- hotel was excellent and good value for what you pay."
288,2142,"Aug 17 2005	Good Hotel Excellent Wharf area location	Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, the rooms with king size bed were nice, although a little small and with limited closet space. Everything was clean and of reasonable quality, and the sleep number beds were interesting. Our first night we had adjoining rooms with two double beds and a balcony, these rooms were not as nice as the king size rooms the next two nights, they seemed a little older and of lesser quality. For tourists interested in the Fisherman's Wharf area, the location is great, plus its really not that hard to get around the city. We took a cable car (the line was silly long) to Chinatown and walked back, drove to Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park, and drove to a couple other locations in town (though parking was a little difficult in a few places). With so many restaurants within short walking distance, Im not sure why people cared that the hotel has no restaurant. Our kids enjoyed the pool, go in with them or you'll freeze watching them, only complaint about the pool was that it closed at 9:00 PM. We had limited luck with their concierge, they were ok at telling you the basics, but weren't the best at getting restaurant reservations and they weren't there after 7:00 PM. All in all, the hotel was good, its not luxurious but the overall condition was good and of above average quality."
289,2142,Aug 4 2005	Pleasantly suprised	I used this sight before booking and once I saw some of the hotels in person that get higher ratings I was amazed. I was SO glad I booked at the Radisson and not somewhere else. The hotel is in a great location. We could see Alcatraz and the bay from our balconey. Everything was either closeby or a short walk. There is even a grocery store 2 blocks away. We stayed in SF for 4 days before heading over to Monterey and rented a car for the trip there. The car rental place was 3 blocks away which was great since you really don't need a car in SF. It was nice to be able to pick it up so close to the hotel and then return it to the airport. The hotel was very clean and quiet. We had a wonderful time and I would definately stay in this hotel again. I highly recommend it!
290,2142,"Aug 4 2005	Can't beat the location	Stayed here two nights and found the hotel very good. The biggest plus point is the location, but it had everything we needed for a great stay. The room was very comfortable with a fridge, huge bathroom - no complaints. The pool is quite small but adequate with a seating area outside on the terrace. It's a shame there's no restaurant inside the hotel but there is a coffee cart in the lobby which was open from 6.00am to 12 noon selling drinks, muffins, pastries and some fantastic donuts which the kids loved. There are lots of restaurants near the hotel, so the lack of restaurant isn't really a problem. The best aspect of the hotel is the location - yes, there are a few homeless people in Fishermans Wharf but there is also great street theatre, a lively atmosphere and all the amenities are close by, including the ferries to Alcatraz and the cable car stops."
291,2142,"Jul 31 2005	Great location Great stay	I have traveled to SF before, always on business. So I have a preference for classy boutique hotels when I do business travel. But this trip was with my family, so I was a bit more budget conscious, but I still wanted some place cool.Boy did we luck out at the Radisson. We read dozens of reviews of various hotels in the city. My wife spotted the Radisson. I was very wary of staying near the Wharf. But the reviews sounded good. So we booked.On arrival we were not disappointed. Lobby was very small. But clean. Small coffee/danish bar (not free). Staff friendly. We checked in to a room on the top floor. Outside our window was a perfect view of the bay and Alcatraz! Room was small (never stayed in a big on in SF!) and clean. Hotel has wireless internet if you have to do business. The location could not be better, if you want to do touristy SF stuff. As someone has noted, IHOP was on same block, as was Johnny Rockets and a McDonalds, not to mention a hundred other places a few blocks away.Right in the middle of all the shops, stores. Ghiradelli Square four blocks away. Just look at where it is on a map and you'll see. I don't think I ever did so much with so little walking in our lives. When kids got cranky we could easily go back to the hotel to get recharged then hit the city again.I felt bad for families that stayed over the hill in the center of the city. They had to endure long lines for the cable cars and a long haul back and forth from the Wharf.Pier 39 was two blocks away. But if you want to do Alcatraz, get your tickets a few days before you want to go cause they were sold out each day we were there. Three car rental places within three blocks. Weather was actually cool (in July!). So we didn't think we'd use the pool. But the kids insisted and we're glad we did. It was heated. Like bath water. I wholeheartedly recommend the Radisson on the Wharf. I thank all the previous posters for helping steer us correctly."
292,2142,Jun 5 2005	Enjoyed the stay	My family and i stayed at this hotel in May of 2005 for 3 nights. Upon arrival we had been allocated a room with no view and asked about availability of change. The staff were more than happy to accomodate us. We were unable to have a front view but were given a room to the side but still with a good view of Fishermans Wharf. We found the staff - from the front desk to the cleaning staff all to be extremely friendly and helpful. IHOP was a great cafe for breakfast and you are lost for choice for eating places at Pier 39 etc. We were not bothered about the fact that the hotel did not have a restaurant as there are plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance. The location was fantastic and the room was very comfortable. We would definately stay there again.
293,2142,"Jun 5 2005	Radisson Fisherman's Wharf... Lucky Find	We just returned from San Fancisco Radisson Hotel Fisherman's Wharf and were very pleased with the hotel and the location. The room had an excellent direct view of the bay and Alcatraz. We were in the smoking section which is on the forth floor directly facing the water ( no extra charge) and we could open the window for fresh air. The room was large and was nicely decorated (not old and shabby) The lobby is marble tiled and somewhat classy and the hotel staff was wonderful. We asked for a mini fridge and they brought it up in 3 minutes, you can also get a microwave if you need it. The pool is heated and surrounded by palm trees. There is a 7-11, a Safeway and a Trader Joes arround the corner for buying wine, beer and snacks.  The location is just can't be beat. Short walking distance (no steep hills) to 2 cable cars locations, Ghiraldi Square, The Cannery, Pier 39, Blue &amp; Gold fleet to Sausilito &amp; Alcatraz,The Embarcadero, North Beach and China Town. The F trolly car passes in front of the hotel and you can hop on for $1.50 and take anywhere. Great seafood surrounds you and all with in walking distance, in particular Scoma's and The Crab House. Also within walking distance is The Buena Vista (c. 1890's) by the Hyde St Cable car turn arround which offers wonderful food, breakfast all day &amp; nite, Bay &amp; Golden Gate Bridge views and is famous for Irish Coffee. You can rent a car at Dollar rent a car with is directly across the street at the Sheraton, weekdays when booked online is $20.99 with unlimited miles and take day trips north over the Golden Gate Bridge to Muir Woods, Nappa and Samoma Valleys. Or take a picturesque costal drive south on Route 1 to Santa Cruz, Montaray &amp; Carmel by the Sea. Drop the car off after hours to avoid overnight parking fees and just walk across the street to the Radisson.  We would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel and would return to the Radisson in a heart beat."
294,2142,"Jun 1 2005	great location and sleep number bed	Spent memorial day weekend (May 26-31) at the Radisson without complaint. However, I will point out a few several pro's and con's of the experience. The location was excellent. It is the ONLY hotel (noteworthy) on embarcadero st. facing the waterfront. The sleep number bed was perrfect. Average size rooms. Basically nothing bad to say. We were pleased. The next time, we will try an elegant hotel, perhaps the one across the street. Otherwise, the price and location were fine."
295,2142,"May 29 2005	Prime Real Estate ...	We planned a trip to Alaska, cruising out of San Francisco on May 16th.We wanted to attach a 3 day stay before the cruise. We chose Priceline, and what luck in getting the Radisson. The location was perfect. We used public transportation, walked many, many miles, bike the bridge and took a taxis to the ship ... all with the assistance of a well informed hotel staff at the Radisson, even during very busy moments in the small lobby area.Food of all prices and variety was available everywhere and with the convenient hotel entrance next to Pier 39, we could return quickly to the hotel room for a sweater, camera batteries, or the typical needs of a traveler enjoying fabulous seafood.We have used Priceline many times and always got excellent results, some hotels add a 'fee', not the Radisson ... we expected to be in a room somewhere near a storage closet. We were not surprised when our window opened to the second floor parking lot but beyond the parking facility was a spectacular view of Alcatraz ... we were happy.We had to wait for the cruise ship to get our beds turned down and get chocolates on our pillows but the Radisson offered SleepNumber beds ... first time we have had this luxury in a hotel!Why did we give this hotel an excellent rating? Dollar value, of course, but bottom line is: When we return to San Francisco, we will book directly to the Radisson, resisting the temptation to save a few dollars with Priceline and giving up the priceless value of location."
296,2142,"May 16 2005	Great location just perfect for a sightseeing holiday.	Dont listen to any of the bad reviews here, this hotel was perfect for a sightseeing holiday which is one of the main reasons why you would go to San Francisco. The rooms are basic but they have all the necessities you would need when staying somewhere. If you get a good room with a balcony you have a view over the bay which is a bonus.The location is perfect and is a walk away from most attractions, like Pier 39, which has many shops and restaurants, designed to meet many peoples needs. The must visit restaurant is Bubba Gump (based on the film Forest Gump for those of you who dont know). The food is great in there, as well as the service as they have some system where you show them a sign on your table when you want attention, plus it has great views of San Francisco bay while you eat. Plus Pier 39 is home to the famous sea lions, but be warned they really do smell.Even though the hotel doesnt have any where to eat there is an IHOP right next door so if you like the American style pancakes this is the place for you, visited most mornings for breakfast as the prices where very reasonable plus it filled you up right until lunchtime so you can concentrate on your sightseeing. The hotel is also a short distance away from the main cable car stop which will take you China Town and Union Square (a must for any shopperholics, nearly spent a whole day here after visiting China Town and afterwards had an excellent meal in the Cheesecake Factory on the top floor of Macys even though it took over 45 minutes to get a table it was well worth the wait).The staff at the hotel are friendly and are willing to help you with any questions you should have. The rooms are cleaned everyday and are to a good standard even though the dcor is a bit old. When there you should take the lift up Coit Tower to have an overview of the city and the walk up to the tower also has good view of the crooked part of Lombard Street. For tours to Alcatraz it is best to book the trip before you arrive as you may be disappointed as it gets booked up very quickly and the queues to buy tickets are very long. I booked the trip with a company called Travel San Francisco (www.travelsf.com) who combines the tour with either a tour of the city, a trip to Muir Woods and Sausilito or on its own. They were very helpful and quick with replying to my queries.All in all we had a fantastic time in San Francisco and would use this hotel again."
297,2142,"Apr 28 2005	Staff is excellent nice spacious rooms	I have stayed alot of places in my 50 plus years but I have never had a staff treat me as well as they did. From making dinner reservations to running a map on Yahoo for me without asking they are by far the best staff I have ever encountered. I would reccomend that all Hotels and Motels study this staff and copy their every move if you what to be successful in this world of mediocraty. The rooms are spacious with a large bathroom, great location, within walking distance of most of the major attractions and you can get free parking if you are 50 or over which saves you about $30 a night. Thanks again and I will never stay any other place again when I travel to San Francisco."
298,2142,"Apr 24 2005	Beware buses	Stayed three nights. Hotel standard and fairly impersonal - handy parking although at a cost - you could park along Beach Street for less if you could put up with the inconvenience. No catering in the hotel but great places for breakfast very near and good dinner locations nearby. Be careful where your room is. Ours was on Beach Street and one morning at five a.m. three buses arrived outside our window. American buses seem unable to turn off their engines and remained there - engines running - for almost an hour, and the receptionist couldn't see what the problem was. In conclusion, check it out for it's convenience and location, but be sure to get a room away from the street, even to the extent of declining the accommodation if none is available"
299,2142,"Apr 10 2005	top notch no complaints	i could not praise this place enough. i dunno how anyone could give this place anything but top marks. except maybe donald trump or elton john! the location is fantastic couldnt be better, the staff where great, the rooms nice with everything you could need including a huge comfy bed, i would say this isnt a luxury hotel but certainly a higher grade tourist type of place. there is even a nice small pool on site, loads of great places for food and drink near by. i wouldnt dream of staying anywhere else in san francisico and because of this hotel i will use other radissons on my next usa trip. 10 out of 10 here!"
300,2142,"Apr 8 2005	Great Stay	Radisson has an excellent location - right on the Wharf. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. There was a hairdryer, 2 telephones and a coffee maker. There was an ice machine near our room to fill the ice bucket. Bathroom was well stocked and clean. Rooms were overall very good and we were pleased with the hotel and its superb location."
301,2142,"Mar 30 2005	Nice Hotel......Closest to Pier 39	My family of 4 just returned from a 3 day stay at the Radisson on Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel was fine, great location for tourists such as ourselves who wanted easy access to the Wharf. The room was clean but the beds were a bit small as they are only doubles. No big deal. We enjoyed our stay and would do so again. Excellent hotel for easy access to the Wharf and Pier 39."
302,2142,Mar 30 2005	The Radisson on the Wharf	We stayed at the Radisson on the wharf on March and it was terrible. The beds were very uncomfortable and there was absolutely no view. We had to ask to be moved to a different room as soon as we got there. It was suppose to be non-smoking and it smelled awful. The staff was very good however. I would never stay there again.
303,2142,"Mar 29 2005	Great position - good value	Stayed at the Radission Fisherman's Wharf for 7 nights in March 2005 (booked via British Airways holidays). Were given a 4th floor (top) room with balcony and a great view over the Bay and Alcatraz. Room and facilities were great for the special offer price we paid but the published web price would have been way too much. No food available in the hotel but plenty nearby.Made good use of the 7day Muni pass and found buses, trams and cable cars efficient and easy to get anywhere in the city. F-line streetcar was particularly useful and fun. Easy access to ferries across the road. Used adjoining Johnny Rockets diner for breakfast several times - brilliant 60s diner and background music. Also used IHOP once but disappointing.We would certainly stay at the Radisson again."
304,2142,"Mar 9 2005	Great Holiday - would stay again	We stayed here 14-16 November 2004. On checking in we were given a room which we suspected was next to an air conditioning unit and there was a horrid humming noise. We rang the main reception and within 5 minutes had a new room. This new room was compact, but clean and tidy with a nice bathroom. We even had a sea view. The location was really good - right on the front at Fisherman's Wharf and no more than a 5 minutes walk to Pier 39 and the boats to Alcatraz. Near lots of restaurants and shops and the cable car stops and also the main picks up for tours.No real restaurant in the hotel but IHoP which is part of the block containing the hotel offered good range of food (not just pancakes) and good value."
305,2142,"Feb 25 2005	No Problems	My family and I stayed here Feb 2005 for 7 days.Excellent location ,everything is walking distance. ( Food and Beer )All staff were very helpful , porter borrowed me his mobile charger for the duration ,as mine didnt work ( stupid 110v ).All bus stops right outside front or rear doorsOK the rooms are small ish for 4 .As we only use our rooms for sleeping, and washing there wasnt a problem. I suggest to all going to san francisco, go to this hotel ,and GET OUT and see the city. To anyone going there just to stay in the room 24/7 and moan, go somewhere else or stay at home !!!!!!!!!!The only problems I had were the dossers around the area,on almost every street corner . Perhaps the police can remove these as it does bring the area down.ILL BE BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!"
306,2142,"Feb 24 2005	It's okay	I stayed at the Radisson on the Wharf for 3 nights. Like all the previous reviews said, the location is great. It is right there on the Wharf (being the only true &quot;oceanfront&quot; hotel) and it is less than a minute's walk from Pier 41--where you catch the blue and gold fleets to Alcatraz. Public transportation is also only a minute away from the hotel and the surrounding area is nice and safe. I had a clean room with 2 standard beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Compared to other hotels I've been in, the room was a little small, but it was fine. However, the walls are paper thin and I stayed on the second floor in a room facing the intersection of Powell and Beach so I could hear the cars and busses go by. (this was no fun since I was already adjusting to the East-West Coast time change). But other than that, it was okay. If you are looking to really soak up the city and set up base from the Wharf, I really recommend this place. I booked through a major hotel consolidator for $70 a night, and so for the price and location combined, I would stay here again."
307,2142,"Feb 6 2005	pleasantly surprised...	After reading the mixed reviews, I was worried about my stay...Upon my arrival, I was plesantly surprised. The fornt desk clerks wew helpful and my room had a balcony with a clear view of Alcatraz. While the hotel is not brand new, it is exceptionally clean. There is no restaurant or bar, but the hotel is right in the center of everything. Overall, the stay was great..."
308,2142,"Feb 4 2005	Great Location	Perfect location for our visit. We came to see attractions in the pier area including cable cars and visit Yosemite National Park. Tour operators out the back of the hotel. Hotel was very clean, staff were great, room spacious and hassle free. Close to variety of eating places."
309,2142,Feb 3 2005	GREAT LOCATION	Yes location couldnt be better!!! Directly at pier 39! Rooms are ok compared to the price. The staff is friendly!Good choice!! If i come back i will stay there again!
310,2142,"Jan 4 2005	Great location disappointing hotel	I was not thrilled with the rooms or grounds of this hotel. The hallways were dirty, smelly and dark. Our room looked as though it had been quickly remodeled and the view was dismal. The staff, upon arrival, seemed overworked and disinterested but when we left was peppy. We stayed in four hotels (including 2 other Radisson's and one Crowne Plaza) and this was by far the worst of the bunch! I wouldn't stay there again."
311,2142,"Oct 27 2004	Not bad	Stayed at the Radisson when it was a Travelodge Hotel a few years back, it was ok then, staff were great. Since Radisson had it the rooms were refurbished nicely and they had these Radisson Fisherman's Wharf mugs in the rooms (yes one did fall into to suitcase when I left).The hotel is right on the front of Fisherman's Wharf, opposite Pier 39. Busy area, but not bad, there is no major disturbance. The Pool is not very good, in fact, I didn't want to get into it, it just looked naff. There wasn't a Restaurant at the hotel when I was there, this may have changed.Anyway to sum up. It's a decent hotel, I'd say it could be over priced due to the 'Radisson' branding compared with the Holiday Inn Express Hotel down the road where you can get a better rate and breakfast included. It's ok and I would stay at the hotel again, but the HI Express has got the edge these days... Some rooms however have great views out to the Bay and Alcatraz."
312,2142,"Oct 22 2004	Embarrassed on our wedding night!!!	My Grandmother had bought my new husband and I a night at the Radisson in San Francisco for our wedding night as a wedding present. Since she lives in New Mexico with my parents she had to secure the room with her credit card over the internet and telephone, and they sent her numerous forms via regular mail for her to fill out to verify her identity, etc, so she could pay with the credit card without them actually having the card in their possession, as is their policy. So everything was supposedly ok and they told her that the room was paid for with her credit card. When we went to check out the next morning, they informed us we had a balance of $192! I said that the room was already paid for, it was a wedding gift from my grandmother and had been paid for months ago. They told us that they do not accept payment without having a credit card in their possession (even though my mom and granmother had done everything the hotel management told them to do to get around that policy, and it had all been approved!) They flat out refused to even call my mom and grandmother to try to get things straightened out! It was a very embarrassing situation, being in the lobby of the hotel on the day after our wedding, having to pay for our wedding present and having everyone in the lobby listening to the conversation as well. I don't think the staff handled the situation professionally at all. The lady at the front desk made us feel like we were some lowlife scum trying to skip out on the bill. Thank goodness we had the money to pay for it or I don't know what we would have done!!"
313,2142,Oct 19 2004	The Radisson Was Just Great!	The Radisson Hotel Fisherman's Wharf was great. I read all the negative reviews and was expecting to find this place somewhat below standard. We had previously stayed at the Sheraton (across the street from the Radisson) and the Hyatt and wanted to try something a little less expensive. What we found was a little older very clean hotel. The desk staff were very helpful and polite. The cleaning staff was outstanding. Our room was ready when we got to the hotel (4 hours before the normal check-in time of 3 PM). This was also Fleet Week which sees a big increase in bookings.The only things that were negative were the in-room safe didn't work and the buttons on the phone that allowed you to make a wake-up call didn't work. The safe wasn't a problem because we don't travel with valuables and we had to go to the front desk to ask for a wake up call. The lobby is nicely appointed. The rooms aren't large but they are clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size with a good size counter top.There is an IHOP located on the property plus a Johnny Rockets at the end of the pool area.There is a private entrance to the Fisherman's Wharf area that is really a nice addition. You use your room key to open the locked security door.There is a Safeway super market two blocks south (across the street from the Sheraton. This place is really expensive but you can save a few bucks if you get one of their Safeway Club cards. You get the card from the cashier after you fill out a short form.There is also a Burger King near the Safeway that didn't accept American Express Travelers Checks (we found that strange). A taxi ride from the airport is expensive - it cost between $40 and $50 one way. The high end is due to the cab drivers taking the longer route to Fisherman's Wharf. We understand the city is trying to stop this practice.What it boils down to is this - the Radisson is all about location. If you love the area as we do you can't find a better location. We stayed a week and had a wonderful time. We would stay here again.
314,2142,"Sep 13 2004	$30 parking fees	Although Radisson hotel at fisherman's wharf has an excellent location, the rooms are small with a huge TV armoire with uncomfortable doors. Also, I was not expecting a $30 parking fee per day. At least they should have included it in the orbitz price. It meant an increase of 25% !."
315,2142,"Sep 5 2004	Decent hotel Fantastic location	This hotel is in a great location - right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf and overlooking Pier 41. . We stayed here for three nights in September 2004. I had read the reviews and was a little concerned that the hotel would be below standard. It wasnt. Rooms were of a decent size - with 2 double beds, armchair, TV, bathroom, fridge and safe. Check in was efficient.Dont expect any views of the Wharf unless you pay for them. We got a web rate on the hotel which was $109 per room per night which was excellent value for the location. They do charge $28 per night for car parking but this is the going rate for 24hr parking in the area. Its a good place for families as it is so close to everything at Pier 39, in the wharf and the Alcatraz ferry. The cable car stop is a few blocks away and there is also a Johnny Rockets and IHOP on site for breakfasts...(which pleased our 15 and 11 year olds!)The pool was heated some of the time but not all. Its fine for a dip but the pool area doesnt get a great deal of sun so it can be quite cold. If you have a car, we strongly recommend doing the 49-mile drive around San Francisco. Its a great way to see all the main sights and is well signposted by blue and white seagull signs around the city."
316,2142,"Aug 31 2004	Very Noisy Room but great location	Spent 3 nights at Radisson. We really loved the location of the hotel right by the Wharf, however the hotel room was very small and our room was located on the street side (right hand corner of hotel) which was very noisy. During the night, many trucks would pass by and wake us up. The room was very small especially for a family of 4, but it was clean. We loved the location, yes it is touristy, but it was a fun location to be in. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but there is a small coffee cart in the lobby and an IHOP right down the block, plus with Pier 39 across the street many breakfast spots available. Next time I would stay at the Argonaut Hotel, which is down a few blocks from the Rad and got great reviews."
317,2142,"Aug 23 2004	horrible hotel	Stayed here three nights in Aug. 04. Location is the only positive thing I found here. Hotel rooms while clean are very small, doubles only no queen beds, beds were small and uncomfortable, we had to order a rollaway which they charged $15. per night for and had to squeeze it in between the two doubles. Front desk personal are of very little help with information as all the ones we talked with were from a foreign country with little knowledge of s.f. When we inquired about the cable car the girl informed us that though she had lived in the city for 10 years she had NEVER ridden on it, maybe management can spring one day for a trip for the employees on one of the best known sightseeing rides in the world so that they can answer questions. What of the concierge you may ask, well when there was one availabe their knowledge was'nt that much better than the desk personal. She sold us a day long city tour and told us to eat a good breakfast (which you have to go out of the hotel for, as they have no restaurant) because the trip was all day and we would not have any stops to eat at, turns out there are two stops in the morning and a lunch break of at least 1 &amp;1/2 hrs in between and another stop on the afternoon trip.Security at the hotel is very laxs and my wife and daughter were followed to the elevator by four street kids who jumped off the elevator when my son and I got on before they could. The wharf section of the city is very touristy, good place to buy souveneirs and really smells bad. Parking is $15 per day and is very limited, after returning one night we had to circle around for 1/2 hr before finally squeezing our suv into a compact spot. Much better choices for the money in frisco try the nob hill area or Saulaslito only 20 min. drive. and much nicer."
318,2142,"Aug 16 2004	Great location!	Spent one night here, before going to the Napa Valley. We had a room on the 3rd floor directly facing the water. Great view of Alcatraz and Pier 39. Really great view. We opened the sliding door to the patio because the weather was so nice and the music from the pier could be heard. The staff was great, especially the concierge. My only complaint would be the tiny cramped bathroom. The view and location more than made up for the bathroom!"
319,2142,"Aug 10 2004	Okay Room/Great Location	We stayed at this Raddison last week. The room was very small. (My daughter said she felt like she was on a cruise ship.) However, when we got to the hotel we were upgraded to a room with a view of Alcatraz even though we had only paid for a room with no view. Also, you can not beat the location of this hotel. You go out the back door and are right there at pier 39. The front desk clerks could have been friendlier but they weren't rude. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
320,2142,"Aug 4 2004	Very Disappointed with this hotel!	This Raddison does not measure up even to Motel 6 standards! Upon checking in, our room was not ready and we waited several hours to get our keys. Our room was fairly clean, but had many stains on the carpet and many burn holes in the blankets on the beds, although this was supposed to be a non-smoking room. Each day, between 7-8 in the morning, I went to the front desk manager and asked that our room be cleaned while we were out sightseeing. 3 out of the 4 days we were there, the room was still dirty at 5:00 PM! When they did clean it, they would only leave 2 washcloths and towels even though we have a family of 4. I left a note to the maid along with a nice tip. The maid would take the tip and not leave the extra towels/washcloths. The staff acted as if they could care less about their service. We also asked the concierge about directions, and she told us to take the wrong streets many times. The only thing going for this hotel is the location. I would not recommend this hotel. We spent more time complaining about our room and the service than it was worth! Would definitely stay across the street at the Sheraton or up the street at the Best Western Tuscan Inn. The Tuscan Inn was rated the same in our package brochure through Southwest, yet when we checked it out, was twice the hotel that the Raddison is! Don't make our mistake!!!!"
321,2142,"Jul 28 2004	AWESOME Location	Stayed here with my boyfriend from out-of-state over the 4th of July weekend. They gave us a third floor corner room overlooking the wharf and we were able to watch the fireworks from our balcony. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and the staff quite friendly. IHOP is just next door, as are countless other dining opportunities on the wharf. Waking to the sounds of seagulls and the boats coming in was a plus. Despite the hotel itself being a bit old and dated, we had a great time, thought the location was fantastic and we would stay there again."
322,2142,"Jun 29 2004	Great Location	Great Location. Central to all main San Francisco sites. Loved the access from the courtyard of the hotel direct to the Wharf. Found hotel staff to be knowledgeable and friendly. Rooms are a bit on the small side, our party consisted of 2 adults and 2 children. But for the location and proximity for a reasonable price it was worth the close quarters. When ready to leave the city, the hotel is near several major car rental agencies."
323,2142,"Jun 20 2004	Good Hotel with a Great Location in Tight Quarters	Location, location, location! The Radisson Hotel Fishermans Wharf is located right on the Waterfront, next to the Pier 39 Entertainment Complex. The Radisson is in a fully renovated 5-story 1950s building. Hotel dcor is best described as modern contemporary, and the property was fully renovated in 2000. There is an on-site Parking Garage ($25/day) with tight spaces.The front entrance to the Radisson is off Beach Street (directly across from the Sheraton). You walk into the small lobby decorated in earth tones and a nice granite tile floor. The front desk is on the side wall and there are large glass doors leading to the pool courtyard. The staff was professional, but lacking warmth. Check-in was easy and uneventful and we were off to our room. We went to the elevator lobby and up to the 5th floor.The corridors in the hotel are tight. Halls are well lit and decorated nicely, but there is barely enough room for opposing traffic to get by. Our room was a south facing room (city view). The room was a little smaller than average, but was quite attractive. All furnishings were in good condition and the drapes opened up to a delightful city view. Our room looked out across the Sheraton Hotel and up the hillsides of the city and Coit Tower. Trolleys passed below continuously on Beach Street (which my son thoroughly enjoyed), but this caused no disturbance to us. There were two full size beds in our Double Room configuration. Bedding was clean and comfortable, very characteristic for a 3-star property. Bathrooms were very clean, but on the small side. Rooms include coffeemakers, in-room safes, Two line phones with voicemail, dataports, alarm clock radios, ironing boards, hairdryers, PPV movies and video games.The hotel has no dining in the facility. This is odd for a Radisson, but with all the dining options nearby at Pier 39, this is not a problem. In fact, I dont think I would have eaten there anyway. The Concierge in the Lobby was very helpful in suggesting restaurants. Unfortunately, no restaurant means no room service. But San Francisco is famous for its take out and delivery, so take advantage of that.There is an outdoor heated pool in the central courtyard. It was very pleasant, and there is also a fitness center available for your use.In closing, the Radisson Hotel Fishermans Wharf is a nice place, with a primo location. It is the only hotel on the waterfront in the Fishermans Wharf area. The Sheraton is only one block farther, but all the others are a good walk away. For the money, the Radisson shines. But dont be confused, it is only a 3-star hotel. If you need more in a hotel, I would recommend the Sheraton or the Hyatt."
324,2142,"Jun 8 2004	Great Location	This hotel is right on the wharf, well the nearest. So its just a case of walking round the corner where you can take a trip to Alcatraz, a bay cruise or take in the not so wonderful stench of the sea lions! I booked the hotel on the internet and filled in the form to request a smoking room, not realising that California are totally against this bad habit, I consequently did not get a smoking room as the hotel has only 8 such rooms and they were already booked, so dont expect too much, all hotels which state they have both types of rooms probably dont have too many, as smoking is not encouraged in this part of the world not even in bars. The hotel is very clean and has large rooms but does not have a breakfast room, there is a cart selling coffee and pastries etc but its not cheap. A IHOP is located next door which always seemed popular, a whole airline crew came in there the morning I was there, complete with their luggage. Its pancakes with everything so if you dont like them you can go to Johney Rockets for a real American diner experience, you would believe you were back in the 50's, this is located out the door from reception past the very small pool and then you walk in the diner through its back door, when you leave, through the front door you are on the wharf! Round the corner from the right of reception is a 24/7, here you can pour your own coffee-around 12-20 different varieties, always piping hot, very good and inexpensive, they have a selection of cakes and pastries but its take away, also I dont think you could ask for anything they didnt have here in this shop, wine, sweets, chocolate, toiletries. We walked a few blocks to the Cannery and the trolleys leave for Union Square area a further block, the view from here of Golden Gate bridge is great. Travelled first weekend in May and never saw a cloud, photos are fab, blue skies for 4 days. Fishermans Wharf is the best location unless you want to spend yout time shopping for designer gear in Union Square."
325,2142,"May 31 2004	Decent Hotel Great Location	As others have described, the hotel itself is nothing special with pretty much run of the mill rooms and amenities. The location is this hotel's major asset. It is right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf and a great &quot;home base&quot; for visiting San Fran. This was our first trip to San Fran and we wanted to do all of the &quot;touristy&quot; things so this hotel was great for us. You're close to all of the Wharf's attractions (sea lions, boat tours, etc), plus you can easily jump a trolley or cable car within a couple blocks and get anywhere in the city. Definitely try to get a &quot;bay view&quot; if you can, otherwise you might just as well stay at one of the other off-the-water places depending on prices, as this hotel is nothing special without the view. The hotel is shaped like a big fork with three &quot;tines&quot; pointing toward the water, if you can get one of the end rooms (like we did) you will love the view. Our room was just off the water with a great view of the bay. We could even see the sea lions at Pier 39 from our window (room 4112). In summary, we had a great experience but I believe that we also kind of lucked out and got one of the best rooms available (top floor, right off the water). If you can get a good price and a bay view it's a good deal, otherwise you may want to look elsewhere. Also, I work for a large company and was able to get a great corporate rate with parking and breakfast included. We paid $107 per night. If you work for a large corporation you might check to see if you can get a better than advertised rate."
326,2142,May 28 2004	Not up to Radisson standards - like a Motel 6	My flight arrived at noon but even though rooms were available I couldn't check in till 3pm because of hotel &quot;policy.&quot; The staff were not up to par with the exception of the maids who did a good job of cleaning up. The heat lamp and vent in my bathroom did not work and I put in a work order which was totally ignored. For a day the elevator appeared to be out of order. There is no restaurant or bar in this facility. I have stayed at numerous Radisson Hotels and have been happy but this hotel does not deserve the Radisson name.Sorry Radisson but you need to junk this place or change its' name so you are not associated with it.
327,2142,"Apr 30 2004	Good clean comfortable hotel would recommend.	Stayed here April '04. Hotel was very good with clean rooms and very friendly and helpfull staff. Great location for Fisherman's Warf. Views of Alcatraz and SF Bay from some rooms. Johnny ROckets (on site) god for burgers etc set in '50's style diner. Fisherman's Warf, touristy and everywhere closes around 10pm, if looking to eat or drink late was told to travel to North Beach area (only a few blocks away). Would recommend stay ing here as most of the city tours start and end on the warf."
328,2142,"Apr 24 2004	Don't make out mistake!	This Radisson was a major disappointment. Upon checking in the room was not even ready for our arrival. The hotel has NO restaurant, bar or lounge area. Even though we were staying at this hotel we were charged $23 per day to park our car. A charge that was not disclosed until checking in. The front desk staff were less than helpful and customer service was lacking. Housecleaning staff were very thorough. For the price we were paying, it was disappointing to not have a refrigerator in our room. Other than the location the hotel was subpar for a Radisson. We recommend staying at the Sheraton across the street. Just as close to the Wharf but much better."
329,2142,"Apr 20 2004	Comfort Great Location 	Our stay at The Raddison at Fisherman's Wharf from April 2nd through April 7th was very pleasant. This was our first trip to San Francisco and the Radisson was a perfect hotel for us.The Positive The Radisson's Location is 2 blocks from Pier 39. Muni transportation whether Trolley cars or The famous Cable Car lines are just steps away. Dining options all around you from Fine Italian or Seafood dining to Ihop and Dennys 2 block either direction.Room: clean and comfortable Service: Done with a smile no complaints from Front desk to concierge to Bellman and maid service were above average. Family friendly. Kids looked like they were enjoying their stay.Amenities: Small Pool, small fitness room though fitness room open 24hrs was nice in this small hotel.Drawbacks: None major,though we would of liked a bar lounge on site for a evening wind down. No restaurant on site but little coffee and doughnut wagon in lobby.I would easily go back to the Radisson. Price was a factor and this was a bargain. There are many many hotels within in a four block radius from Hyatt, to Sheraton, to Marriott,to Holiday Inn and even a Travelodge. I enjoyed the Radisson . See Sanfrancisco stay near Fisherman's Wharf you will enjoy. Most times you get what you pay for but we got a little more thanks Radisson!"
330,2142,"Apr 14 2004	Don't be afraid to stay here	Stayed at this hotel for one night in early April. Room was very clean, though not large, but was great for what we needed, which was somewhere to sleep before heading to Napa Valley. Loved the location! You could not get any closer to Fishermans Wharf. Within one block of Alcatraz Ferry, Sea Lions, Museums, and tons of shopping. When all you need is a clean room, this is the place. Staff was very nice and tried to be helpful, although they simply didn't seem to be able to answer many questions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is not going to be spending tons of time in their room. And when in San Francisco, why would you?"
331,2142,"Feb 26 2004	Great location small rooms minimal food on site	We stayed at the Radisson Fish from 2/18-24/2004. Our reservation guaranteed an ocean (bay) view room, but when we checked in we were told that there were none available, and furthermore the reservation was a request only, not a guarantee. We pushed a little and spoke with the manager and she agreed and gave us a bay view room the next day. All turned out OK, but one should not have to be pushy to get what was paid for. The location in the wharf was great, close to everything. The IHOP next door had great breakfasts and great service. Watch out for the slippery bathtubs. They should include a mat or non-slip surface. The Sheraton across the street has a classier lobby with a shop and a restaurant. If returning we might try the Sheraton if the price is as good as the Radisson."
332,2142,"Jan 25 2004	a great hotel in a central location	This hotel was in a great location if you want to visit the fisherman's wharf and pier 39 locations. There are plenty of restaurants to eat at nearby, but none in the hotel. To see the rest of the city the cable cars are about a ten minute walk from the hotel. We had no problems when we stayed here for 2 nights. They had plenty of parking so bringing a car was not an issue."
333,2142,"Jan 5 2004	Stay at Radisson on fisherman's Wharf	Visited San Francisco for the Diamond Walnut Bowl on New Year's Eve and stayed at the Radisson on Fisherman's Wharf. All of the staff that I encountered were very nice, helpful and polite. We had a broken water glass that needed to be replaced and after calling the front desk, housekeeping arrived just moments later. This hotel is located in a very busy area and I expected it to be very noisy on New Year's Eve however I was pleasantly surprised at just how quiet the hotel was since our room was on the Fisherman's Wharf side of the building. We had no problem with the room, it was very clean and well maintained. Parking in the hotel lot is $23 a day. We had a very good experience and will stay there again."
334,2142,"Oct 16 2003	Convenient Location	We chose this hotel because of its very convenient location, virtually across the street from Piers 39 &amp; 41 of Fisherman's Wharf. This is Tourist Central in S.F., whether you want to shop, see Alcatraz, cruise the bay, admire the sea lions,or take a bus tour--it's all there outside your door. You don't spend much time in the hotel. The lobby is small, with fee-based internet available, and a coffee cart (this Starbuck's lover found the coffee surprisingly good) and somewhat helpful concierge. Front desk staff seemed disinterested/on verge of being annoyed every time I dealt with them--maybe they are overworked. the 2 Elevators are independently programmed, therefore they are slow and inefficient. There is a small but servicable fitness center, and accessible through the pool courtyard is a diner style restaurant (which was blasting music way too loud for breakfast!). The pool courtyard is lovely, with a garden area; however, even though we were in S.F. during supposedly their warmest season (October), it was far too cold for outdoor swimming or, for that matter, sitting in the shady courtyard) We paid about $111 per night, plus $23 per day parking, for a room that was clean, spacious, and afforded us a nice view of Nob Hill and the south of the city. In short, the Radisson was all that we were looking for, and no more."

1,2147,"Oct 1 2009 	Been staying at the Roberts for 30 years	I've come up from LA to work at the Zoo now and then for the last 30 years. Hate to tell the people that don't like the place but it has been remodeled. But that was about 25 years ago and then again about 10 years ago. There was less rooms and more apartment like rooms instead of what they have today. It's the best price at the beach in all of SF. About half as much as it's closest competitor. No it's not a 5 star but it's a good place. The folks running it are nice. Always quiet during the week for us working guys that stay there. If your looking for a Hilton Resort stay at a Hilton Resort. This is a place with a bed and a shower. Good for road warriors. We bring our own pillows, soap and towels anyway. All that's missing is a big flashing neon sign and the place would be perfect. It's mine and my crews home away from home when we're in SF. Plus we do bring our wife's and girl friends here too. So far no divorces or breakups over it."
2,2147,Aug 24 2009 	Done the job	Motel was fine although some problems with the toilet but we got moved to another room! I would recommend it if you're on a budget travelling with friends as it is close to the beach and beside the tram to city centre!As i said it done the job and i liked the seaside theme going on in the rooms!Ask for Uncle John.....he'll make you at home in San Fran!
3,2147,"Sep 25 2008 	the rudest experience I have ever had	I have stayed here once before and it was ok. The place is very old and run down. I use the chain lock and put suitcases in front of the door to feel safe. I stayed here this second time because &quot; The Great Highway Inn&quot; was booked. In addition this is where my grandparents use to stay when my grandpa had to go to the VA hospital. I believe it is not the same ownership though.I didn't sleep very well because I had forgotten my own pillows and their pillows are completely flat. When I awoke the following morning I got up and went to Ocean Beach, which was my whole purpose for being in the city. I lost myself in the walk as the ocean is captivating. As I arrived back to the motel on foot I was looking in the windows for check out time and so nothing posted anywhere. I looked in the room and on my receipt which was just my credit card receipt. There was nothing saying when check out is, nor was I told when checking in. I figured with most places it is between 11 and 12. It was 10:45 so I decided to jump in the shower. I thought I heard the phone ring while in the shower but was not sure. Once out of the shower did the usual girl thing and blow dried my hair. Once done I heard this knocking on the door and someone saying something about check out but could not quite understand. I called back that I wasn't ready yet. Within 10 mins there was another knock on the door by the lady manager, I presume. She begins yelling at me to &quot;open this door right now&quot;. I said, &quot;do you mind if I put my shirt on first.&quot; I open the door and she rudely says, &quot;it is past check out. Next time answer the phone. Check out was at 11 now get out. It is 11:45.&quot; I was shocked. I said, &quot;do you mind if I get my things first.&quot; She just looked at the cleaning person and said, &quot;she is done.&quot; I loaded my things, turned in the key, and got into my car. The clock in my car said 11:30. I will never use this motel in my life again. If I have to I will use Days Inn a block up."
4,2147,"Feb 26 2008 	It's a beach Motel Get over it!!!!	Well, maybe I am just not &quot;picky&quot;. This hotel looks really run down on the outside. I was pretty skeptical the first time we stayed there. The rooms are definately not &quot;fancy&quot; but have everything you need. We have stayed here with our family at least 5 times. We go once or twice a year. So there may be a few grains of sand in the carpet...what do you expect. It's two blocks from the beach. The zoo is across the street, and a great cafe next door. What I love about it. We don't have to drive, once you are there, everything we do is walking distance. My son is 6 and loves it there! We don't have to worry about him ruining the place because it is just a good old, down to earth, crashing place. Has cable and coffee, bed, and a shower. That's all ya need. The best rooms are upstairs in the middle. Can even get a glimpse of the ocean in betwenn buildings. I am glad the snobs can go stay in a fancy place and get ripped off, but I love Roberts and will be going back again and again. The owners are nice too, they let us keep our car there extra long, so we don't have to pay for zoo parking."
5,2147,"Oct 8 2007 	Could use alot of improvement	Many years ago I used to stay here on fairly regular basis. Some things never change...like a great location. Otherwise, since the place was taken over by a new owner, who doesn't seem the least bit interested in puting any money into the place it has deteriorated noticably. I just completed by most recent stay today. First when you check in the smell of curry from the resident manager/owners kitchen is overwhelming. The room is self was OK, but simply that. It was in many respects kinda rundown and shabby. The exterior is awfull and has not been painted in at least 20 years. The walls are paper thin and you can hear ever detail of what is being said, or &quot;done&quot; the the rooms next to you.Now I read one of the reviews hear that talked about hookers hanging around the place. Well Roberts is kinda dumby I've never seen a hooker around this hotel and this area and I know it very well.If possible you money could be better spent elsewhere. If you can't find anything else, as was the case with me, you can stay here for a night in acceptable comfort."
6,2147,"Aug 4 2007	Hooker infested dirty nasty place	I stayed in this place during the week of the forth of July. It is awful. Very dirty rooms floors have not been cleaned in what looks to be years. They are nice people who run the place, they even allow the patrons from the zoo to park in the lot on &quot;free zoo day&quot; they charge them $5.00 to park while they are at the zoo. The only problem with that is that if you are renting a room you have to wait for a place to park. On the night of the 4th. I listened to a hooker yell the same line over and over to different clients all night. During one of her sessions her pimp even busted thru the door to let the guy know that &quot;he did not pay for that&quot;. I assume he was in his van in front of the Motel monitoring with a baby monitor. It was a long sleepless night. This would be a great spot for vice squad to work the area."
7,2147,Nov 9 2006	great find	if you live in the city its great! its close to the beach and other attractions. only bad thing is if you stay by the street gets really loud in the mornings with the street car going by. but i really loved the bath rooms. so what if they weren't all that great but if and your hunny are looking for some thing just for a night of romance and don't really care where then i would sugest this place just for the fun bathrooms. all the bath rooms in the shower have a seat where you know lots of fun can happen. but there is no tub. so if you wanted that this is not the place for you.
8,2147,"Sep 25 2006 	A Different Kind of Stay	This is not a motel for the weak of heart. It is, in all senses, that sort of Raymond Chandler-esque &quot;sleazy dive&quot; that is only missing the gangsters and hard-boiled detectives. But it is a place to stay, reasonably priced, and no more outrageous than some that are far worse. My stay was shortly after the current owners took over, and they did their best, but it was clear that being hoteliers was not in their blood, and that their &quot;vision&quot; of running this place was flawed. I had stayed previously (2001-2002) when the previous owners, who had a clue, still ran it.Nonetheless, the night I arrived was the worst storm to hit the SF Peninsula in a long time, with Beach Avenue closed, and police clearing people off the beach for safety sake. Winds and rain, lightning and thunder, all crashing with the waves not 500 feet from my door and window.It was the most spectacular stay in a motel I have ever had. Second floor, watching California weather at its most magnificent, from a vantage point that I would have never thought possible.It is rundown, a bit dingy, and perhaps not a five-star luxury palace for those who wish to be pampered.But for those who want to experience a classic 1930s motel, in the middle of the Sunset District, with a western view that is to die for, there is little better than this.And for the full effect? Pick up a Raymond Chandler novel to read before bedtime instead of watching the tube, or book a room when you know a storm is coming. I'm going to be in SF in the next few months, and have no qualms about booking another room there."
9,2147,"Aug 7 2006	Horrendous Motel	You would do much better to sleep out on the sidewalk in front of this place than to pay money and check into one of their rooms. Forget the money part of it for a second...the sidewalk would be cleaner...no less noisy...and actually less depressing. The rooms are dingy and moldy and dank. The beds are squalid...hair and dried fluids all through the bed and on surfaces and the carpet is foul, greasy, stinky and exudes particles into the air when disturbed by somethng as basic as walking upon it. These things however, pale when laid up against what ensued on my stay there. My girlfriend and i checked in for a week and after accomodating the dismal condition of the room...settled in unfortunately. On waking up the third morning we were both covered with what we thought were mosquito bites. Through that day...these bites kept increasing and encroaching in intensity and by the fourth morning...we were both in great duress and shock from these bites which had turned into aggravated welts. I checked the bedding more closely and found little points of fresh blood stains on the sheets and a little dead bug of a type which i hadn't seen before. The welts were running across my body in long staright rows that were deep and red and i was trying to control a feeling of panic. My girlfriend's face was covered with them. She ended up with around 200 bites and i had about 150. Upon doing some investigating...i found that this was a bed bug infestation. As someone who's made a living on the road for 35 years...this was the worst thing I've ever encountered in a sleeping establishment. We checked out on that fourth morning and i required medical treatment and steroids to overcome the danger of these bites. The physical scars are still with both of us six months later. If i had a choice between sleeping on a park bench or sleeping at Roberts By The Beach Motel in San Francisco...i'd take the bench with no second thoughts. Horrible experience indeed."
10,2147,Mar 29 2006	What a view	This motel is not for the 5 star set but if you want a relatively reasonably priced place to stay where you can look out of your window and see the Pacific Ocean then this is place fits the bill.
11,2147,"Jan 1 2006	Bad Hotel!	Bad!Bad! Bad! I think that a rating of &quot;terrible&quot; is too good for this hotel. I couldnt get a single minute of sleep because of the foul smell of mildew inside my room. I couldnt go outside either seeing that it was pouring rain. On top of that, the bed sheets were torn and stained, and I found already opened condoms underneath the bed. Upon entering the room, a rat came running out from under the bed into one of the holes in the wall. At around 3:30 in the morning the few people in the hotel that could actually sleep were awakened when a group of about 5 or 6 teenage kids came into the parking lot and tried to break into one of the vending machines with a baseball bat. I was almost scared to death in the morning when I went to fill up the ice chest and I found a homeless man asleep next to the ice machine. A vacant lot next to the back parking lot literally looks like a dump, with a fence all around and all kinds of garbage from tires to dead pigeons to used needles.  I PAID FOR A CLEAN, SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP, NOT A FILTHY, DIRTY HAUNTED HOUSE!!!"
12,2147,"Sep 21 2005	WORST motel experience of my life!	Do NOT let the ocean nearby, sway you into this dump. I booked in advance, was later told my 'room' wouldn't be ready til evening, dispite my request and telling them my time of necessary arrival. Place was awful. Damaged carpet, holes in sheets, staff disregarded my reminding them I'd requested mid day arrival, to fit my schedule. DO NOT take any room before seeeing it first, ever. Shower water pressure was unstable, and weak. I had trouble keeping the temperature in balance, it would fluctuate from hot to cold to tepid, and it was scary and felt dangerous. Sheets had holes in them, one blanket on bed was ratty and old. Place looked like some slummy dump, but I had no time to request money back, or leave, as I had an engagement I couldn't be late for. Otherwise I would have done this immediately.I was miserable. There were other guests that disturbed me, and upset me greatly. I did not sleep at all, and was ill in the morning from such a bad experience and felt sick and left there sick. My schedule was pressing enough, and this, was a new and horrid nightmare. This place is very old and not kept up. I've traveled before and never had this kind of experience, ever. Motel 6 is five stars over this dump. Do not even think about this place, ever. My booking in advance didn't matter, and I was very specific about my time of arrival, and then left to kill time, til 'they' had my room ready. Which was hrs later forcing me to rush and be stressed even moreso, after traveling, packing, etc. One window was taped with clear postal tape, shut. The other side, was hard to open, to allow fresh air in. It was a dangerous to customer, neglected place, and the worst. I was in fear of my own safety, in fear of being broken into the room, during the night due to the postal taped window, which wasn't repaired, and subjected one to such fear. If I wasn't so pressed for time, I wouldn't have 'settled' for this.. and perhaps I shouldn't have and been late to my engagement, and gone elsewhere... and I sure do regret not doing that. This place needs to be remodeled or condemned, it was just that bad.DO NOT GO to this place, it was awful and I concurr with others who've reviewed this place and they're correct about their own experience."
13,2147,"Apr 9 2004	Just bloody aweful in every way	About ten years ago I used to stay here often. It has gone down hill in a big way. I stayed at Roberts Motel on April 6th. I was appalled by how bad is was:Flithy WallsBig globs of snot smeared on the wallNo TV remoteThe most uncomfortable pillows ever, anywherePeeling paint and huge patches of falling wallpaperCould hear every sound in adjacent roomJust awefull in every way!"
14,2147,"Feb 20 2004	Never again!	All I can say is that I was warned by the previous reviews. But I made my plans to visit San Francisco at the last moment, and the other hotels close by were either booked up or had only smoking rooms available. So I took the room at Robert's, only to find that my &quot;non-smoking&quot; room reeked of smoke.Roberts Motel is the loudest, worst motel I have ever stayed in. I could hear the couple in the room next door playing some strange game until after 11:00 p.m.-- she kept shouting, &quot;Seven, seven, seven!&quot;--and then they started arguing with one another at 7:00 a.m. The walls are so paper-thin that I could tell when the woman was speaking while brushing her teeth. I finally banged on the wall when I heard the man clearing the mucus from his throat, spitting it out in the sink, and then burping.All the information in the previous reviews regarding the noise of cars, trains, buses and diesel trucks is accurate. I was awakened all night long. But I don't think I would have slept anyway with the &quot;pillow&quot; on my bed which was about 1 1/2 inches thick. I rolled it up into a tube and used it as a neck roll.The only positive thing I can say is that the staff at the desk were polite and efficient. I didn't bother to tell them about my dissatisfaction because nothing short of razing the building to the ground could improve the place."
15,2147,Oct 18 2003	Look Elsewhere!!!	Thought I'd try the Robert's Motel since I know the area. Big mistake!!! Manager's teenage daughter came back to the parking lot about 1:30 a.m. with a large group of rowdy friends and decided to have a party! Tried calling office to no avail - had to call SFPD! Poor construction leads to poor night sleep since you can hear your neighbor's televisions. Next time I'll spend the extra ten bucks on the Days Inn a half-block away! Stayed there before and it's much cleaner!!!
16,2147,"Aug 14 2003	Loved sleeping by the sea	Roberts-At-The-Beach Motel is a worthwhile motel w/ rates of $75 Sun-Thu, $85 Fri-Sat. The biggest drawback is the traffic noise. There was no A/C in my room as your really don't need it but when a diesel truck is parked nearby, the engine noise is annoying if you're looking for peace and quiet. Also, you can't have the window curtain open without the passerbys being able to see you. The biggest plus is the location: only a block and a half away from the beach. There are small restaurants close by and the Zoo across the street. There are stops adjacent to the motel for the bus and Metro train that comes every 10 minutes. As tourism is high in S.F., it looks advisable to have reservations for weekend stays."
17,2147,Dec 18 2002	A great lodging experience	Quaint rooms give that cozy comfortable feeling as you take in the ocean breeze and listen to the surf as it peacefully puts you to sleep. Across the street is the zoo and you wake up listing to the animals. The staff is extremely curtious and helpfull. One can see they take pride in providing the best experience for their customers. Very clean. Public transportation to all locations are just a step away from the motel. I recommend Roberts at the Beach to everyone visiting San Francisco.
1,2148,"Nov 16 2009 	Never staying here again	Good thing I didn't pay much to stay at this dump. The walls were extremely thin and as soon as we got there, we could very clearly hear people having sex through the wall. The next morning I woke up to a blaring TV in the next room and someone getting high right outside our door. The parking is rediculous too."
2,2148,"Jul 13 2009 	SATISFACTORY HOTEL	I stayed here for a couple of nights recently. I was just reading some of the bad reviews and felt it necessary to give a favorable one. It's certainly not a luxury hotel but for the price (I paid $40 a night,) I thought it was a good deal. The room was clean enough (didn't leave with bug bites!) and everything worked properly. The front desk staff was friendly enough and my room was fairly quiet."
3,2148,"Apr 8 2009 	Dangerous Rip-Off	My friends and I stayed here over a long weekend to see a concert @ The Filmore, thinking it was a good place to stay, and within walking distance. Boy, were we wrong. Our car as well as another guests was broken into while there, leaving the drivers seat shattered and a 12 hour drive home with it. The manager offered nothing but a broom. There are drug addicts outside of it at night. Sketchy Neighborhood. Keep it."
4,2148,"Mar 15 2009	Horrendously nasty. Don't waste your time.	We made our reservation by phone, taking advantage of choice hotels stay 2 nights get one free special. We navigated to the hotel, drove into the garage, and parked. When I got out, I unloaded my suitcase and started to set it down, when I noticed wetness running down the pavement. I looked around, and realized that I had almost set my suitcase in urine where someone had peed in the garage. I went to the office and checked in. The guy gave me the key cards in an envelope that was BLACK with filth. Literally. I don't mean dusty or slightly dirty. I mean filthy, like it had been used 10 or 12 time by nasty people. Trying not to touch it, I slipped the cards out and left the envelope with him, in spite of his insistence that I take it. We went to the room, and it was absolutely grimy. The inside of the bedspread was soiled black, and blankets were nappy and sticky feeling. I went back and told the guy the room was filthy, and he came and inspected it as if he had no idea what I was talking about. At this point, I just demanded a refund, and we left. he was insistent on showing me another room, and I refused. While I was dealing with the manager, my brother was standing at the door of the room watching a crackhead perform a sex act on another in the alley. What else can I say?? Don't go there! I complained to Choice, to no avail."
5,2148,"Feb 1 2009 	Never never stay here.	I use to like this hotel because it's central and a good bargain. However it's gone downhill beyond belief. The staff is indifferent when there is a problem and don't make any effort to compensate. I've had problems like message lights on my phone blinking all night, boogers on the bathroom wall, a drugged out woman screaming and crying all night long, and a very loud party keeping me awake. With each issue, I called the front office but they didn't take care of any of the problems. In the case of the crying woman and the party, they didn't even answer the phone. The crying woman was banging on the office door all night long and I was calling them as well but they never responded. I finally called the police. The next night there was a loud party with people running around the hotel screaming, banging things and keeping people awake. Again, the front office never responded. When I brought it to their attention at check out they didn't seem to care to much. No offer to compensate me for my loss of sleep for two days. This is the worst run hotel I've ever dealt with."
6,2148,"Oct 13 2008 	You could probably do better	The room was excellent. It was large and had a refrig and microwave.The motel is a rather seedy part of S.F. and is too far to walk to restaurants etc., although there are several bus lines within a short walk.The elevator was so dirty that you'd want to go out and buy a can of paint.After staying there for 5 nights, I asked to have my bags stored for several hours. They charged me $10.00!! That was the first time that that's ever happened and I think that it's very petty."
7,2148,"Oct 10 2008 	Not pet-friendly. Also not human-friendly from what I can tell.	Okay, I admit that I did not end up staying at this motel, however, I did try. Now that I've met the staff, I will never stay at Rodeway. I had a negative experience with the male/female couple operating the front desk tonight. Basically, I was already staying in a nicer hotel around the corner, and took my dog out for a late night stroll. When I noticed the Rodeway sign, I remembered that I had a 'dirt cheap' coupon for it in my tourist packet. I went to the night-window to ask if they allow dogs. They turned me away, which isn't a big deal, but it was the manner in which they did so which frustrated me. I realize the area is crappy, and there are 'crazies' lining the street at night, but I come from a upscale neighborhood and I hold a graduate's degree. I know that doesn't make me more important, but I suppose I'm not used to being dismissed in such a way. I was respectful of them and would have liked them to reciprocate that etiquette towards me. I don't know what I expected from a cheap motel. Perhaps other people already 'bothered' them by attempting to bring in a dog earlier tonight. Perhaps they were having a couples' squabble. Perhaps my hair looked disheveled because I decided to walk Ginger one last time before bed. Perhaps it's a cultural difference and they make awful faces at everyone.Perhaps it was because they are just plain rude. :-| The bottom line is that I stopped by as a *potential future customer* and I left offended. There are polite ways to tell people their motels don't allow pets, especially considering that pet-people might return to San Francisco without their dogs one day. Rodeway Inn left such a bad impression on me that I feel compelled to let reviewers know about it!"
8,2148,"Oct 3 2008 	Still a good deal...barely	Can you still get a decent room with free parking in a safe neighborhood within a mile of Moscone Center in San Francisco for under $100? Yes, but just barely, on most nights, if you get here early. Thats because the parking is limited, so if you get in late on a full night you may have to park on the street. (Lots of spaces available on well-lit busy streets.) As for the rooms, well, think of it as Motel 6 but older and with a micro-fridge. The latter is good for me, the self-employed penny-pinching business traveler. But, be aware the shower may be tricky to adjust, the carpet threadbare at the edges, and chairs a bit shaky. On the up side, its clean, safe and quiet  except with the garbage truck arrives and the whole cement courtyard becomes high decibel cacophony. The continental breakfast is a joke: a cold Danish and bad lukewarm coffee. Fortunately, the in-room coffee is fine. I usually try the Best Western group south of Market, but those properties have climbed well into the $150-plus range. This is a notch down in quality, but Im happy with the $160 or so that I saved over two nights. My average rating weighs heavily on value for dollar."
9,2148,"Aug 12 2008 	**********AVOID AT ALL COSTS***************	This hotel is in the worst part of town. NOT the place for families. Look/ask about the hotels a few blocks away close to Fisherman's Wharf- about the same price, nice location but book ahead. When we left the Rodeway Inn Civic Centre in disgust, we couldn't find a room because the good hotels close to the wharf booked up fast - we ended up staying the night in San Mateo at the Comfort Inn, which was quite nice. CAVEAT EMPTOR - may the buyer beware!"
10,2148,"Jul 28 2008 	A good budget hotel	From the reviews I read I was a bit concerned but my experience was very different. My room was cleaned and bedding changed every day. I met the staff who were doing it and they were friendly and helpful. I had a tv, the air condition was a fair age and rattled a little but it did its job and the shower worked every day.If you want style and comfort then you may be the ones who will put this place down but if you want a base to enjoy the city from it is fine. I could hear noise from the street outside but no more than I would expect in the middle of the city. There were homeless people around but the ones I met were friendly and it wasnt that much trouble to turn down thier requests for money.I had a little over 5 minutes to the Muni at either Van Ness or the Civic Centre, busses ran from Van Ness just round the corner and a couple of days I walked in to Union Square, about 20 minutes. I had to be aware of where I was when in the Tenderloin but I never felt in any danger at any time.I only slept in the hotel, I left early and came back late but the horror stories dont ring true for me. I cant speak for every room but mine did the job so I had a brilliant holiday in San Fransisco"
11,2148,"Jul 26 2008	What Can I say?	After reading so many reviews in this page, I was afraid, but to tell you the truth, it wasn't SO bad. At least I was complete every day. Ok the zone is bad, to much homeless, specially at night, and at around 5 PM there is the same homeless outside the hotel; fortunately you can have Van Ness Ave. and the MUNI system near to transport wherever you want. The manger, yeah he is rude and doesn't have a clue about where he is. My dad asked him if he knew somewhere we could take a tour to Napa Valley and he took a map from the desk, and surprise! he didn't find Napa on the map, so he didn't knew. Also we asked him if he could call us a taxi to the airport, he said no, and gave us 2 numbers to ask for it. The room was nice, no beautiful, not incredible, it was nice. I was fearing to have some cockroach on it, but, it was incredibly clean. And although it says they have HBO, I can tell if I saw something like HBO. Although the breakfast is included... don't expect a breakfast, really, go and get some food out there."
12,2148,Jul 21 2008 	Rudest Manager - Never Again	The manager was terrible. I've never had someone yell at me like that before - he was rude and actually kind of cruel. I left a dress in the room and went back to try and retrieve it - it turned into a nightmare. Knowing that people can be that rude and still run a business boggles my mind. The room itself wasn't that bad for the money - we were only there to sleep. Just please beware - I wish I would have looked at all these other reviews first.
13,2148,"Jul 17 2008 	A Horrible Scary Nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	This was one of the worst places I have ever stayed. I was scared to death. the area is horrible, the parking garage is scary,the elevator and the area that it is in is too. The manager or who ever he is was so rude, he harrassed me about paying with cash. I secured the room with my credit card, but when I gladly checked out the next morning, I wanted to pay with a travelers check, I was told he didn't have change. My husband had to walk down the street and get change so we could give him the correct change. The room was smelly. The homeless are everywhere. I certainly would not recommend this hotel to families. I am very disappointed because this ruined my first visit to san francisco. The wharf area and the cable cars was nice."
14,2148,Jun 6 2008 	fire the manager and I'll go back	Not a bad facility and a clean property for the price. I'd stay in the street before I would ever stay there again and have to deal with the manage. I have made a complaint to choice hotels and never even got a response. The manager makes his own rules and prices he needs to move back to Iraq.
15,2148,"May 27 2008 	Not Recomended	We had arrived one hour early for check in, checked in at the front desk. The lady said the room was ready. Getting up to our room, it was clearly not ready. So we let her know and went downtown til the check in time. An hour later our room was still not ready, at the correct time it was supposed to be. We let her know again and then she told us it would be ready in fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later it hadn't even been touched. We complained again and WE had to ask for a different room. She should have offered a clean ready room in the first place. She was very rude to us and ignorant. I would not recommend this hotel. Also the walk downtown is not very pleasent."
16,2148,Feb 27 2008	the manager is very very rude!!!	customer service by the manager is very fair he is very rude he is not very approachable when asked some questions he is not professional to customers! the room smelled bad all towels were old too!!
17,2148,"Feb 13 2008 	Ok if you're without your wife	I know my way around SF, so didn't mind a stay in this neighborhood. I cashed in my Choice Hotel points for my 2 night stay.Location is a 10 minute walk from BART. It's one block west of Van Ness, a major north/south street. Busses everywhere.Office to check in a tiny. You walk across a driveway to an even smaller elevator. It's smaller than those tiny elevators you see in Europe. The motel looks like a motor court. It also looks like a homeless shelter. Lots of in and out types moving about throughout the overnight hours. Very noisy for a place with all outside entrances to rooms.The room:Small and clean (surprise surprise). Even the bathroom was ok (for a Rodeway). With the lights turned on in the evening, and the curtains drawn, you'd think you were at a Quality Inn or Holiday Inn Express.A few blocks east of the hotel, on Polk, eat at Brendas. ANyplace that has a line in this foodie city, has got to be good. Brendas is southern style, for breakfast and lunch. I met a friend for breakfast.Ok. The big question. Would I go back? No.Next time I'll priceline a 3* for $60.00."
18,2148,"Nov 28 2007	Rodeway Inn Civic Center SF - a Great place to stay on a budget!	My friend and I stayed for a week in March of 2007. Sophie and Babu and Maria (and even Babu's wife) were fabulous hosts! The rates were the best we found within walking distance of our class in the Mission District, and the room was clean, even though it wasn't a new state of the art hotel. When we returned from our classes or from dinner, Babu would be watching to make sure we got in safely. Sophie sent us off each day with a smile. We enjoyed free Wi Fi, and if we needed a lil something in the a.m for our walk, there was coffee, juice and sweet rolls. Babu helped us find a couple of restaurants and when we found a new one that he hadn't checked out, he asked if they had a veggie menu so he could be able to give a recommendation for customers.The neighborhood is very near a couple of streets we didn't care to walk down at night, and yes, there were lots of homeless folks, but even they were cordial and after the first night of asking for a handout, seemed to recognize us and simply wish us good day or good evening.We would definitely stay there again and have referred it to many."
19,2148,"Feb 15 2007	Hated the Rodeway Inn Civic Center San Francisco	The hotel was very old and had an extremely unpleasant odor in the room. The water only trickled from the shower head and was not even luke warm. I definitely will never stay in this particular hotel again nor will I recommend it to any of my family or friends. Although I had two days remaining on my reservation, I checked out after that first night."
20,2148,Oct 27 2006 	Smelly.....	Such a nasty place and area of town. The room smelled of stank tobacco and the mattress gave us real back aches every single morning. There are marks on the walls and one better watch youself when you enter the Motel because there are always odd scary people just behind you.The front desk clerk was rude and totally unhelpful. He really acted like we were bothering him when we asked any questions like where was the closest nice restaurant. Please spend a little extra and stay somewhere else! You will be glad you did!
21,2148,"Jul 17 2006	Great prices	My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights (July 5- 10th) at $65. per night. The location was not great with Homeless people and prostitutes. But the rooms were cleaned daily and the Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell, Subway, etc and Walgreens was i/2 or 1 block away. I was very pleased with the price, accomodations and access to public transportation. Easy walking distance (10-15 min) to Union Square. # 19 and #47 bus to Fishermans wharf. Lot to see 4 blocks down by the civic center. I would definately stay here again."
22,2148,"Nov 1 2004	Such a mess	Oh my ! Where should I begin ? I have stayed at some really bad hotels in my time but this mess really takes the cake. The elevator was rickty ( we got stuck in it once ) and it's filled with copious amounts of nasty grafitti. The room ( as most of them are) was in a dingy interior center of the motel. It truely made me think of the interior of a prison. The room also had gum stuck on the carpet and the wallpaper was peeling off the walls. We also had the pleasure of finding a previous guests stinky sock under the dining tabel along with empty candy wrappers. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the rather musty, stank smell of the room. The room did have a nice TV.. but I had to wipe an inch of dust off of the top of it. !For the love of GOD... I warn you,,,, AVOID this dump. I have personally given up on all Choice Hotels as it seems they have no standards whatsoever."
23,2148,Sep 29 2003	parking nightmare!	When we checked in at 8:00pm we were told parking was on a first-come first-served basis. There were no spaces left. We went out in our car later that evening and came back at 1:30am. There were no spaces to park in. We called management. We were told to park on the street. The street parking was metered beginning at 7:00am with a one-hour maximum. We went to our room pondering which one of us would get up at that early hour and feed the meter for the hour maximum. We decided to call management again and ask what they could do for us. Managements' response was cold and un-caring. They said;&quot;this is San Francisco and parking is not guaranteed&quot;. We decided to notify management that we were checking out. They never apologized and of-course they charged us for the room. We drove home at 2:00am and got into Sacramento(90 miles from The City) after 3:00am in the morning. Don't stay here unless you don't mind not having a guaranteed place to park. Isn't that was a motel means? We were very dis-appointed in managements' total un-caring and un-apologetic attitude.
24,2148,"Jun 7 2003	Reasonable prices	We make frequent trips to San Francisco and we always use this hotel. Its not fancy but the rooms are clean, the staff are friendly, its reasonably priced, and its centrally located."
25,2148,Nov 3 2009 	Sympa et pas cher
26,2148,Oct 2 2008 	Normalito
27,2148,Sep 2 2008 	Hart an der Grenze
1,2150,"Oct 26 2009 	great location	The hotel is situated near China town, north beach and you can pretty much walk to the main sightseeing points. Not luxury but a very big bed! Quite thin walls so you can hear a lot of what's going on in the next room but apart from that I would recommend this hotel to the budget traveller."
2,2150,"Oct 19 2009 	Cheap room with free parking -- Great for sightseers!	We spent 2 nights at the Royal Pacific. We chose it mostly for it location and free parking. In a city where parking alone costs upwards of $25 a night, a hotel room with parking for around a $100 was a great deal. Don't chose the Royal Pacific if you're looking for luxury -- but perfect for the budget travel who wants some place to sleep &amp; clean up at modest cost.Close to the cable car line (just a few blocks walk) and Fisherman's Wharf. A short drive to the Golden Gate Bridge and most of SF's attractions. The neighborhood was a little overwhelming when we drove in the first night, but didn't feel unsafe as we walked around in search of a place to eat.The Thai restaurant just a few doors down served a great dessert -- we wished we'd had dinner there because the food smelled soooo good."
3,2150,"Oct 14 2009 	Inexpensive home base for SF sightseeing	OK, it's not the Ritz, but we stayed 3 nites and figure we had $300 extra in our pocket for meals etc. Very comfortable, basic rooms and a really convenient location."
4,2150,"Oct 13 2009 	Decent hotel convenient location.	I just returned from a 4-day stay at the Royal Pacific. It was an average visit. I was neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed by anything in particular. It served it's purpose as a reasonably priced hotel in a convenient location. It's located right on the edges of Chinatown and Little Italy so you only need to walk a few blocks to find great food. We walked to Fisherman's Wharf one day and took the 30 bus down Stockton another. You were also within walking distance of a cable car stop. (General SF tip: the MUNI travel pass is a good deal if you expect to use public transportation frequently) It did have free wi-fi, but you had to use it in the little lobby. But, I guess compared to paying extra at the big hotels that already charge you alot, that's not a big deal. They charge for ice and you can rent a refrigerator if you need one (so no doggie bags, folks). They did call for my airport shuttle and gave me a $2 discount, which was convenient. However, the room was dark. There was one small ceiling light and one bedside lamp with the heavy black-out drapes. There was a distinct chemically smell in the room which didn't dissipate. The lady at the desk said it may have been related to the the recent renovations, but she did make a note of it. And, my roommate was awakened by women outside the door at 3 AM yelling obscenities at a man. &quot;Breakfast&quot; consisted of 2 pre-wrapped pastries. It was clean, aside from the smell, and I felt relatively safe. As I said, it was an average stay. I've been asking myself if I'd stay here again. Because of the price and location I might. However, if I hit the Mega Millions or found my sugar daddy I'd be laying my head somewhere else. Not a bad place for what it is, though."
5,2150,Oct 8 2009 	Just for the location and parking	We picked this hotel for the location and free parking. Employees at the front desk were very unfriendly. The loby is very very tiny and looks awful. Our check-in took about half an hour as one of the rooms we booked was cancelled somehow. They arranged another room for us and luckily the rooms were comfortable and clean. No breakfast facilities etc - just a basic motel.
6,2150,"Jul 31 2009 	more than we expected	Me and my husband stayed here and we were so suprised at how fast the service was. The room although not the one we reserved (we reserved a King bed room but it is not available yet when we arrived), we got a queen bed instead and the room is very big! We got there around 9am and they checked us in early! They have a separate laundry room where you can wash clothes privately. And also they have free wi-fi too. Great service! We will definitely come back!"
7,2150,"Jul 15 2009 	Maybe the best value in the city	It was our second stay in San Francisco and we stayed for two nights.At checkin they give us a parking permit and a free upgrade for a better room at the backside of the building where is no trafficnoise.The rooms are clean and at the next day we found two packed pastries in the room.Chinatown, litle Italy, Fishermans Wharf and more are in walking distance.If i come back to San Francisco i will stay there again because it's a good value."
8,2150,"Jul 8 2009 	Loved it-Exceeded our Expectations for the Location!	My family and I just returned from a 2 week long road trip vacation to California from Alberta. Our first stop was the Rodeway Inn in Pocatello next was New York New York in Las Vegas, then the Del Sol in Anaheim and next was Americas Best Value Inn in Santa Cruz. Then we stayed at the Royal Pacific Motor Inn in San Francisco. This was a pleasant surprise as the drive to the Motor Inn showed some seedy streets. However it ended up being in a fantastic location in China Town-walking distance to both Fishermans Wharf and Union Square. Check in was easy and the desk staff was very friendly. They thought our Canadian drivers license was funny! They also offered us a room in the back as it would be quieter-thought that was a nice touch! Our room was on the second floor and quite roomy for what we expected of the location. We were easily able to set out all our luggage and tote bags. The room was clean and we liked that you had to use your card key to enter each floor. They had told me that they offer pastries for breakfast and this turned out to be 4 danish-type pastries in cellophane on the table in our room. We didnt eat these, but got our own breakfast. Overall we liked the Royal Pacific and would definitely stay here again as we thought it was good value for the money-especially with the free parking! We also liked that they provided free internet. They have a computer set up in the lobby for guest's use and while we couldn't connect in our room with our lap-top we were able to sit on a couch in the lobby and connect there."
9,2150,"Oct 23 2008 	Why Stay Elsewhere?	I have to admit that we have stayed at the Royal Pacific for over 25 years when we visit San Francisco. We have always found the location convenient to Little Italy and Chinatown and the added bonus of free parking a fantastic bargain in San Francisco where parking is rediculous.This time we decided to spend a little more money and get a King Room with kitchenette which consisted of a seperate area with wet bar, microwave, and refrigerator.The room was much larger than their standard room and consisted of a King Bed, comfortable convertable couch, 2 nice sitting chairs, a desk chair and writing desk, and a small dining table with 2 chairs. There was plenty of drawer space and a closet between the bedroom and bathroom.The hotel is just finishing extensive remodeling with all rooms refurbished completely. Our room, which I believe is reflective of the remodeling, had new carpet, wall paper paint, new furniture, all new plumbing fixutres, including new sinks, tub/shower, etc.We were very pleased that we spent the extra money to have the convenience of this room which by the way ran $139.00 per night which in San Francisco is a great bargain.I would also like to make a few comments about the owners who I would not by any stretch of the imagination call &quot;abrupt&quot;. Both greated us in very friendly way and were proud of their remodeling. If you want an absolutely quiet room you might want to think again about staying in downtown San Francisco. Although I prefer quiet at night I have never found it hard to sleep at the Royal Pacific keeping in mind it is right in the center of activities."
10,2150,Oct 8 2008	Perfect location in SF!	Perfect location in San Francisco...walking distance to Chinatown and North Beach. Ideal restaurants in area and many nice sights to see. The rooms are newly upgraded. VERY clean and nice with all the amenities you need. We love this place and will stay nowhere else in SF!!!
11,2150,"Sep 23 2008 	Average	We chose this hotel for both the parking and for the location. It seemed to be central for everything we wanted and seemed to be reasonably competitive price-wise considering that our stay coincided with a weekend period. The website states that the hotel is on the edge of Chinatown and although I did not investigate this any further, I would imagine it is as busy as the centre. It took us a while to drive through the numerous sets of lights and the massive hoards of people crossing the roads. The parking seemed limited, but we luckily found a space by the main reception door on arrival and left it there until we left. Although it seemed safe enough I did feel happier that the car was by the front door and in full view of the reception area. We were greeted by a reasonably abrupt chinese lady who immediately passed us off to her colleague to deal with when someone else entered the reception area. I genuinely believe that she was trying to be efficient but frankly it was hard to get away from the rudeness. The hotel was on a main road and our room was on the 4th floor balcony over looking the street. The room was noisy due to both the traffic and the thin walls so we could hear the people next door talking and showering. People also thundered down the corridor with their children and their luggage.Aside from this, the hotel was ideally located to walk to Pier 33, Fisherman's Wharf and the Italian quarter. We had 2 excellent meals, one from the thai diner across the street from the hotel and the second from the pizza place at the end of the road.At the end of the day, the room was comfortable, we were travelling on a budget and the hotel served our purpose for the couple of days that we were there. I would stay again in the same situation but would certainly look around for other deals first. While we were there the hotel was undergoing refurbishment which meant that several car parking spaces were unusable as there are a couple of big skips in front of the hotel. Also, although we had expected the hotel to be non-smoking I found the notice threatening a $250 fine if they think you've been smoking a little aggressive."
12,2150,"May 26 2008 	Very decent hotel for its price and location	This hotel located in china town, is really ok for its price and location. Their staff may not be too knowledgeable, but they are polite and do their work. There are some adult type of business on Broadway (where the hotel is located), but nothing to worry, because a block parallel to Broadway you will find Little Italy, with great ambiance and dining around. Do not let the smell of cigarettes on some of the hotel rooms bother you, they might smell like cigarettes, but you wont get cancer for that (not even if you were to stay there for a whole year, which you wont!) and if you get the smell on yourself, cleanup when you get home, big deal. Whats my point? There are some sacrifices when you get a budget hotel, if those little things bother you, be prepare to pay over 180 bucks per night or more elsewhere. I am pretty sure with that price, you wont smell cigarettes around and the people at the front desk will smile at you and drop rose petals at your feet while you walk towards your room. Would I recomend this hotel as a budget one? You bet!"
13,2150,"Apr 12 2008 	Great location for the price.	Located in Chinatown, right at the edge of North Beach. Within easy walking distance to the Embarcadero, Telegraph Hill, Ghirardelli square, and heaps of other popular destinations. The room was clean, though not especially glamourous. There were some minor issues with noise, with loud guests returning at 3 am, but nothing too bad. Free parking (which is fantastic, given the location) and free internet in the lobby. We'd stay again."
14,2150,"Apr 10 2008 	No frills no problems!	Stayed here for only one night. It's a very basic motel with no amenities to speak of, except for free parking which is really why I consider it such a good deal and would return again when visiting either Chinatown or North Beach. Carpet and floral bedspread were in good repair in the balcony room we were assigned. Blankets and sheets were threadbare, pillows were foam rubber with no give, bath towels were small but fairly new. Shower stall was tiled and very clean, water pressure good. Bathroom itself was two very small rooms, with sink outside toilet/shower area. Cable TV was adequate. Security door locks good. Don't stay in front balcony rooms if street noise is an issue. Cars or trucks passing by on Broadway in the middle of the night sounded like they were going through an long echo tunnel."
15,2150,"Mar 12 2008 	DO NOT STAY at the Royal Pacific Motor Inn	Based on the photos and the rate of $99 a night we selected this hotel. It's amazing how in the photos the room and hotel look white and clean. Quite opposite of that! We will never stay here again. The girl who checked us in was rude. A few minutes after checking in to our room we found that the toilet would not flush (unfortunately after using it). We called the front desk right away asking for another room since the toilet was obviously broken and was told &quot;I call you back later&quot;. When we did get the call back she told my husband &quot;I get plunger, you come get and try fix&quot;. Um, excuse me? Then the motel maintenance guy came and touched the plunger that he was using in the toilet with his bare hands, used our ice bucket and sink, then went in and out of our room twice handling the door knob. I felt sick to my stomach. He said &quot;toilet fix&quot;, after he left my husband did a test flush and found it was not fixed. We finally were able to get another room, which was a smoker's room and nearly gagged from the smells. Needless to say all our clothes smelt like smoke as well as our hair and everything else. The rooms are grimy, with peeling paint and tile, dirty carpets, old blankets that looked dirty and had holes. This was more like a motel fit for roaches."
16,2150,"Feb 16 2008 	Great location decent hotel	Located on the corner of chinatown, 1 block from Northbeach, this hotel is within 15-20 mintues walking distance to many SF staples (Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiradellie Square, Golden Gate Bridge, China Town, North Beach). If walking isn't your thing there is a bus stop about 2 minutes up the street. If your with the family, the area is kind of iffy (there are stripclubs and such just down the block), but that stuff never seems to make it across the street. The hotel is definately dated, but was tidy and the staff was nice.They give you a danish for breaksfast and there is cable in the room. If your just looking for a cheap, safe, clean place to crash at night, this hotel is a great find."
17,2150,"Jan 1 2008 	Excellent location and free parking!	This is a clean, basic, inexpensive place to stay. The hotel is located in a safe area. Chinatown and North Beach are right there; the cable car is three blocks away. One fantastic feature of this hotel is the free and accessible parking. Other hotels in San Francisco charge up to $50 per night for parking; not the Royal Pacific. Staff are very friendly. Make sure you get a room away from the street, as the street-facing rooms are quite noisy. They offer a AAA discount."
18,2150,"Nov 14 2007 	Cheap Clean Sparse	I stayed one night at this motor inn and would probably stay again. It is nothing at all fancy, but the room was in good condition and everything was extremely clean and well maintained. The bed was also good, though the pillows were those cheap foam rubber ones that don't give at all. Minor issue. I felt safe, especially with the three door locks.The location is wonderful, an easy walk to North Beach and Chinatown, and to hundreds of restaurants, bakeries, espresso places, etc. I never touched the cellophane wrapped pastries in my room, choosing to have coffee and breakfast at a nice Italian cafe.I chose a rear facing room but still heard loud industrial ventilation fans from a nearby building. Earplugs are a good idea for sensitive sleepers. Free parking in this part of San Francisco is almost unheard of, and is a great perk included with the room.I don't know where the average rate of $65 comes from, as $95 seems to be the minimum."
19,2150,"Sep 17 2007	Great Value	Location Chinatown. Great food, easy access to MUNI. Not far from anything. Booked the junior suite with the King bed. Note: this is a motor inn, equivalent to Super 8. big in size clean, un- modern. But the Price could not beat it, plus it is right next to Italain district, so food is no problem. Staff very very nice. If we go back we will book our stay there again."
20,2150,"Aug 13 2007 	good location!	We like this hotel because it's located right in the middle of China Town and we're surrounded by good, authentic, inexpensive chinese retaurants (and some Italian ones too). There's a Walgreen right around the corner within walking distance. Amenities are a bare minimum and the rooms are old but clean. We especially appreciate the hotel's flexibility in allowing a family of 5 to stay in one room without extra person charge. Parking is also free which is hard to come by in the heart of San Francisco. Cable car access is within walking distance. Rooms right up against the main street can be very noisy."
21,2150,"Jul 14 2007	sleep cheap eat expensive	Hello all...my family has been staying at this hotel for YEARS. It is clean and has FREE parking and you can't beat the location. My husband and I have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton and it was wonderful, but we prefer the Royal Pacific for its location and it is so easy to walk anywhere you want to go in the city. My father used to travel to San Francisco quite often on business and always stayed at this hotel. When my family went in June, the kind gentleman at the front desk inquired if we were related to my father and asked about him. We informed the gentleman that he had passed away and he was so kind and had such nice things to say about him. This hotel is not the Ritz or the Four Seasons, but is is oh so much easier on the wallet and frees up more money to enjoy many of the fine dining options SF has to offer. In the immortal words of my late father, when in San Francisco...&quot;sleep cheap and eat expensive&quot; and that is what we did (and will continue to do)!"
22,2150,"May 14 2007 	Great location and the rooms are fine.	This hotel is called a motor inn, and that's exactly what it is. Don't expect any luxuries, but it's perfectly fine. It's in a FANTASTIC location, on the edge of Chinatown and North beach (the Italian quarter) and it's about half way between union square and the Wharf, so you're pretty much walking distance from everything. (but if you want to drive they also have free parking!!!) One warning I might have, is if you're booking with them, you should check what the story is with their air conditioning. There did seem to be one in the room, but it wasn't on. I have a feeling it's just cos you have to pay extra, but if you're there in the summer it would be quite important so check it out in advance. We were there late September so it didn't matter.Overall this place is absolutely fine. If you're fussy, go stay in a fancy schmancy hotel, but if you want a great location for a very reasonable price, stay here. (and for any animal lovers - there's also a COOOOL pet store accross the road!!! - I know not really a selling point but I had to go in and take a look and get a pressie for me little moggy!!)"
23,2150,"Oct 4 2006 	Great Location and free parking	[--]Hotel is located on the corner of Broadway and Columbus. It is right on the edge of Chinatown and walking distance from North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and lots of bars and clubs. The downside is the traffic noise and crowded sidewalk. The hotel is clean and reasonably priced. The rooms are comfortable, but not spectacular. Pre-wrapped Danish and coffee are provided for breakfast. The biggest thing going for the hotel is free parking."
24,2150,Nov 9 2009 	Naja...gerade noch okay

1,2153,Nov 7 2009 	My Favorite City	Great Hotel close to Moscone Convention Center for work and being downtown you are in walking distance to anything you want to do.
2,2153,"Oct 27 2009 	Great Hotel with wonderful staff!	If you are looking for a clean, convenient hotel - this is it. With a short walk from the cable car turnaround and easy access to the F Line street car you can get to Fisherman's Wharf or the Ferry Building very easily. Being our first time in San Francisco we didn't know our way around at all so having these things so close was helpful. The staff at the concierge desk was fabulous! They assisted us several times with directions and even made a dinner reservation for us. This location is also close to the Westfield mall along with several restaurants very close. The hotel itself along with the rooms were very clean. If you are on a budget you may want to eat outside of the hotel as the restaurants were quite expensive. The room was a good size but we could have used a tad more drawer space. Although we were in a corner room with two large windows we didn't have much of a view being on a lower floor. Honestly though we weren't there to spend time in the room though so it didn't matter too much to us - a great view is a nice to have. Parking is extremely expensive so keep that in mind if you have a car. This location is very convient for those without a car though (one of the reasons we chose it)."
3,2153,"Oct 20 2009 	Very nice rooms with great beds	The Marriott was a clean, efficient hotel that falls in the 4 star catagory. The beds were ultra comfortable and the views were great. The valet parking and front desk check in is very efficient. The room and bathroom was larger than the normal hotel. The large screen TV and desk area were great for relaxing and working. Their free Wi-Fi area off the lobby is a large area with plenty of desk space for spreading out. This is nice since most hotels in America are bound and determined to try and pry extra money from us to use the internet access in the room. Parking in the area is very expensive and didnt look very safe, so we paid the $55 a day for valet. The Marriot didnt offer any self parking. We were given a very cheap rate of $95 through Priceline with a blind bid for a 4 star hotel. This made the stay even more sweeter than having to pay the normal $185."
4,2153,"Oct 19 2009 	Time for a room refresh	Perhaps I was just in an older room, but for a hotel with a good location and high rates, the rooms had a lot lacking. Older, no free WiFi, expensive parking, etc."
5,2153,"Oct 17 2009 	If you just want a bed (and nothing else) - this is fine.	My hubby was at Oracle World and probably for a business traveller this hotel might have been ok (although no free wifi) - but for leisure not so much. Rooms were small - I like to do pilates in my room, but it wasn't big enough. No free breaky, no free wifi. Windows on our room were so dirty we couldn't tell what the weather was like. Good location - close to Union Square and Westfields (great food court). We used the spa facilities - which were fine (but small). Staff at bell desk and front desk were overworked and short. The room had dirty on the floor which was no vacuumed up the 3 nights we were there."
6,2153,"Oct 15 2009 	You Can Do Better	I attended a five-day Conference in June. Unfortunately, this was the Conference hotel. Had I known what was in store for me, I would have gladly paid the cab fare to commute here from a nicer hotel. My first experience - the outrageous valet parking; they charge you $10 to pickup a car from Hertz (in the lobby). Then, after checking in, and after discovering that several of my TV channels didn't work, I decided to take a shower. BAD IDEA! The shower curtain stank so badly I had to call housekeeping to have them change it. During the Conference, I kept returning t my room (I had left the AC on) to discover the maids kept turning it off (I guess they were trying to save money). The rooms are quite small for the price, and the furnishings dated and drab. The bed was not comfortable and several times we had to call to ask for extra towels. I sent a letter to the manager following my stay, and al I got was a boilerplate email back saying thanks for sharing your concerns. Oh, and I forgot...they tried to overcharge us for Internet service. We logged in at 11:30, stayed online for an hour, and they charged for two days...like $25 (because we went past noon; nowhere did it say 24-hours was noon to noon). Bad hotel. Bad stay. Good idea to stay elsewhere. Not what I had hoped for my first stay in the Bay Area."
7,2153,"Oct 9 2009 	Location location location	We spent 3 nights in this hotel and it worked out to be a perfect long weekend with the kids. It was in the heart of Union Square, so we could walk to the shops, restaurants, and most importantly for the kids- it was a stone's throw to the Kids Museum, bowling alley and ice rink. For us, the location was perfect and we didn't use our car all weekend. We were able to make use of the hotel's free shuttle to the piers and we also used the cable cars. The hotel itself was a very busy, modern high rise with full amenities. The concierge was accomodating and arranged a few events for us and gave good recommendations. Our connecting rooms were of decent size and clean. A few cons: the pool was very crowded and there weren't nearly enough seats for people not swimming and the parking was really expensive (but probably in line with what other hotels charge). Otherwise, we found the hotel to be good for us and we'd stay here again."
8,2153,"Oct 8 2009 	This hotel does not care about individuals or small groups!	I live &amp; work with groups in hotels around the world. I am compelled to write this revue due to the BAD stay with this hotel. Here's my experiences and disappointments:- waiting 20-35 minutes EVERY time I needed to check-in or talk with a front desk agent. lines 30 to 40 person deep. Crowded, busy lobby. Great if you like to stand in lines.- Staff has a &quot;not my job&quot; mentality. Service does not cross union lines...... - Spa/ changing rooms charge $5.00 to change to change clothes in a changing room. Steam room full of old, wet towels and even had a bottle of cleaning spray left inside.- Empty beer bottles in the elevators on Sunday morning at 10 a.m.... hard to believe that they hadn't been there for much longer, but no staff member seemed to care, maybe not their job.....- Many rooms, face interior courtyard rooms... average rooms... room was like an inside cabin of cruise ship.  Wish I could say something good, but unless you are part of huge group who need the city's largest hotel,, Stay elsewhere...... and save yourself the frustration... a black-eye that probably makes lots of money for Marriott....."
9,2153,Sep 29 2009	Average Hotel	Stayed here in Aug with sister and nephew. Good location for sightseeing. Nice size room. Pool a great way for nephew to unwind after being forced to sightsee all day. Air conditioning was slow to kick in. Would recommend if you can get a good rate.
10,2153,"Sep 28 2009 	Good hotel but don't take your car!	We noted some of the comments about cleanliness, size and condition of rooms mentioned in previous reviews, however we found no problems. The room was clean on arrival and was kept clean throughout our stay. Our air conditioning worked properly. The windows could have done with a clean in the room but we did notice that the windows in the 39th floor bar appeared clean; however we were here to see San Francisco from the outside.Checking in and out was efficient and the concierge was helpful although there was a small queue some times but considering how busy the hotel was we did not find this a problemHaving Starbucks in the hotel was also a bonus for an early morning start (opens at 5:30) although we did eat in the hotel once for buffet breakfast which was good.We had a hire car which I could not return until the next day and it cost $55 - 35 (including tax) to park for the night!. The cable cars are 2 blocks away at Market and Powell, however to avoid the long queue a little tip I got from a local (it works) go up a block and jump on. The cable cars are never allowed to leave the terminal full."
11,2153,"Sep 25 2009 	better hotel in the moscone area	I tagged along on my husband's business trip to see san fran. We've stayed at the St. Regis before but work was paying for the mariott. Not too bad, the a/c was a bit slow to kick in. We turned the a/c all the way down to 64 and it only got comfortable the next day. we were on the 18th floor with the concierge lounge and they had a pretty good free continental breakfast. a bit crowded with all the businessmen. it's only a 1 block walk to the yerba buena gardens or mission street with shopping. i felt safe in the area to walk around alone. the only thing i was annoyed by was that there wasn't a wifi signal in the rooms. there was suppossed to be wifi in the lobby but i didn't want to sit in the lobby all day. would've been nice to get wifi in the lounge without paying $4/5min."
12,2153,"Sep 24 2009 	Okay...Strange	Hotel is okay...the rooms are small and cramped...the A/C did not cool the room and we had to get a fan for the entire stay.Hskp was okay...room could use a good vacuum, sticky residue on the vanity, hskp service seemed very hurried things just thrown in place all around a messing looking room.Strange was that the concierge when myself and my firend ask for a dinner recommendation after seeing Kathy Griffin (EXCELLENT SHOW) he starting hitting on us stating that he was aroused?! He asked us if we did three ways! (WHAT THIS PERSON DID NOT KNOW US FROM ADAM) and this was an admitted married man with two kids! This was very bad and not what I expect from a Marriott employee. Just because he assumed that my friend and I were gay he though that he could act like that...I could not believe it!Very weird experience so there are BETTER and more professional hotels to choose from than to ever stay here again."
13,2153,"Sep 22 2009 	Great Stay For The Price!	This was my second time staying at the hotel, and it was my GF's first trip to SF. As a Marriott Platinum member, I've stayed in a number of Marriott properties, and this was consistently good with the properties. While walking around the city, I noticed the other Marriotts, and I have to say this was probably one of the better situated hotels. During our 5-night stay, they must have had one convention after another because the lobby was bustling with people. Overall, we had a great stay, and the people were friendly and efficient. For $135 per night, it was a steal!Plus:- Check-in was quick, efficient, and friendly. Concierge were very helpful with questions.- Location was fantastic. 2 blocks from cable car, 1 block from BART, many breakfast options outside of the hotel.- Room on the 19th floor had view of the city. Great bed as usual. Lots of space.- Exercise room and pool were free unlike the Starwood properties- Cleaning people did an efficient job with our room every day- Concierge lounge was stocked with the essentials despite being crowded during breakfast and evening- 29th floor bar is a great place to have a drink and enjoy views of the cityNegatives:- Windows in our room was pretty dirty. I guess it's understable with the constant fog.- No Wi-Fi in the room !!!"
14,2153,"Sep 19 2009 	Great Hotel and location	Stayed here three nights. Located within 2 blocks of the end of the Powell Street Cable car and BART stop. Also near a large Westfield mall (2 blocks). Felt safe walking around there at night. Can use BART to get from airport to here for $8 then don't need car. If you do get car and plan to leave it in the garage it cost $55, but there is a garage catercorner for a little over $30 (but would get recharged if going in and out for the day and then coming back).The hotel is clean, Starbucks in lobby, free wifi in lobby, typical Marriott pool. Beds are comfortable. Had room on 26th floor with good view of the water."
15,2153,"Sep 14 2009 	No major issues. Average hotel.	Stayed here on business recently. Overall, was a nice stay, but nothing all that special. Perhaps I've gotten a little spoiled at other properties lately!CheckinSmooth and efficient. Very quick. Probably the most friendly of staff members I encountered.RoomWas upgraded to a junior suite. Really surprised how tired the room looked. I thought all of the Marriott's recently remodeled. These guys got the new beds and technology stuff, but the carpets were still really worn. No issues with housekeeping.Concierge LoungeDecent selection at breakfast and happy hour. VERY small seating area -- not really setup for breakfast -- there are maybe 5 tables total -- the rest are more lounge areas which aren't that functional for breakfast. In 3 days, never once did anyone in the lounge speak to me. Even when I was the only person in the lounge! I don't think I've ever had this happen in any other property!Overall, was just ok. Probably would stay again."
16,2153,Sep 11 2009 	Comfortable Bed. Great location for the Price. Close to MUNI.	Fantastic rate can be found on PRICE LINE or HOT WIRE. The location is SOMA but close to China Town and Union Sq. IT IS VERY CLOSE to several MUNI public transportation stops so it's really easy to get around. It is close to some convention centers as well. The beds are comfortable and clean. The rooms are roomy and nicely appointed. We would highly recommend this hotel to those tourists who want to stay at a nice place at a great price (just over $135 per night if you get a good PriceLine quote).Recommend dining at LULU just 2 blocks east of the hotel --- Great food!!ALSO: Don't rent a car in S.F. The MUNI public transportation is fantastic and cheap. get the 1 day or 3 day MUNI pass. It is well worth it!
17,2153,"Sep 7 2009 	Very good Hotel - Does what it says on the tin	We stayed at the Marriott Moscone Centre for the first 4 days of our trip to San Francisco. The first room we were given was right beside the elevator and so we asked to switch rooms to as far away as possible from the elavator shafts (this hotel has several express elevators so lots of noise). They immediately sent a bellboy up with a key for another room. Our new room was on the 15th floor and was enourmous! It was a suite (we only paid for a basic double room) and had seperate living area and bedroom and a giant flat screen TV in each room. The bathroom was a decent size. Everything worked well and the room was cleaned to a good standard each day. This hotel is really for business use which is clear from the other patrons who were staying there and also by the amenities offered. In the lobby (which is always freezing as the air conditioning is always maxed) there is a Starbucks which is handy for breakfast. There is also a bar right at the top of the hotel which has fabulous views of San Fran. Although the decor is a little dated in this hotel, it does exactly what it says on the tin. There is an indoor pool which looked nice (we did not have the time to use it) and an outdoor terrace to relax on.All in all, a great hotel. A great restaurant to try in San Fran is First Crush (great menu and great wines). Also try Fleur De Lys which is fine dining. A little pretentious and the bill will be a shocker - but its a lovely place to go for a special occasion."
18,2153,"Sep 4 2009 	Stay here if you ONLY need a bed close to Moscone Center.	We chose the SF Marriott cuz of the easy walk to the trade show and to host meetings w/partners and customers. If you need small meeting rooms with simple catering, find another hotel. They only offer sleeping rooms with attached meeting suites, unless you want a Ballroom. Coffee is $100 per gallon (so is tea!). Sodas are $6.50ea. When they say you're only charged for what you drink, it's a lie. We shopped at the local Walgreen's for affordable snacks and drinks and used VERY FEW of their catered beverages (only used by our visitors). They charged us MORE that what we originally ordered, couldn't tell us why, and refused to do anything about it. The morning setup folks showed up late, so catering wasn't ready at 8am. When we reiterated the need for 7:45 setup, the next morning they showed up at 6:45 and woke up our CEO. Another time, room service decided to add ice to the setup and made so much noise, it stopped our meeting while she was escorted from the room. I asked for a handicap room for our guy in a wheelchair and they gave him a room with a step in shower, even after I called and verified they had plenty of rooms with wheel in showers. Several of our employees noticed their stuff had been rifled through. This hotel has had so much convention business it no longer knows anything about customer service. The Sales Staff doesn't know about its Suites and they make it impossible to see the Suites prior to your event....they won't even send pictures. They neglected to tell us the Luxury suite (@$50 cheaper per nite) was much bigger than the Marriott Suite and had a half bath off the meeting area. Always make sure the suite you have your major meetings in has a bathroom off it, so the person in the sleeping room (in this case, our CEO!) won't have to share a bathroom with all your visitors. Had we been able to preview the rooms, we would have caught this faux pas. It's a good thing our CEO is flexible and understanding!The sales staff is never around to help. Only the gal at the Sales front desk really exists. I sent an email to the GM of the hotel with all the problems (oh yes, there are more!) and have yet to hear a peep from him. We are a small company and we didn't ask for much...just a couple of nice rooms to meet with customers and some beverage catering. What a nightmare! Next year we will be at a much smaller hotel that appreciates our business. I recommend you do too!"
19,2153,"Sep 3 2009 	Comfy bed clean nice views	We spent 5 nights to see the city for the first time. The hotel is centrally located to all trolley lines and Muni stops. We were all over the place, so it was nice to come home to a comfortable room. All the rooms have a decent view, whether it is of the city or the harbor. The 39th floor has a wonderful bar and restaurant. It is totally worth it to go see and have a drink or a dessert. The food is pretty basic, so dinner might be better spent elsewhere. We are platinum members of Marriott, so the concierge lounge was great for breakfast in the morning. I would say the downsides of the hotel is that it caters to conventions. There was one in the hotel while we were here and the participants were rather rude and loud in the public areas. Oh, and if you rent a car, there is a Hertz in the hotel, EXCEPT, the hotel valet charges you $10 to go get the car for you.. that was a rip off. Next time, I will walk two blocks and go to the regular Hertz rental office."
20,2153,"Aug 31 2009 	Thieves - a Well Organized Bunch	While staying at the San Francisco Marriot, my iPhone and some other items were stolen from my vehicle left to their valet parking. Trying to resolve the issue with the hotel and their valet parking service definitely gave me the impression that the theft and cover-up were well organized.It was my fault to slip the brand new iPhone 3GS, which ran out of battery on my way to the hotel, into the console compartment and forget to take it when I handed the car to valet parking.The next morning when the valet brought out the car, I immediately found that the phone and other items were missing. I reported to the parking manager and was told to wait for their investigation results. From then on every time I asked for an update, I was told that either the parking manager in charge was not in, or they were still investigating. At my last evening staying at the Hotel, I talked to the hotel front desk manager. He called hotel security but told me that the hotel could not do anything about it, because &quot;parking was operated by a different company and we had to wait for their investigation results.&quot; The next day when I checked out, the parking manager told me that &quot;we reviewed the video tapes and questioned employees, and found no suspicious activities&quot;. The only thing he could do was to help me filling out a claim form, which I knew was going to be denied.A week later, I received a letter from the parking company. The letter states that guests should not leave valuable items in vehicles and they are not responsible for anything lost.My impression from the ordeal: San Francisco Marriot has thieves in their parking staff. The hotel and the parking company just dont care about it. They have a systematic way of delaying the complaint until the guest has to leave, and then deny the claim using fine prints on the back of the parking tickets.I filed a police report with SFPD. I encourage other guests with similar experience also file police reports. When there are enough cases hopefully SFPD will investigate.Did I mention that valet parking costs $56 per night?"
21,2153,"Aug 27 2009 	Great Stay! I'd Go Back For Sure!	We celebrated our 30th Anniversary with a trip to San Francisco last week. I chose this hotel for location - and it was perfect! And our room and the service was excellent! I was a little worried with a few of the past reviews -- and yes...I would have enjoyed cleaner windows...but most windows in every building, bus, trolley all needed a good washing! I think it's kind of hard with the fog coming in to keep glass crystal clear. Anyway! This hotel is next to all public transportation - and we got the 3 day pass - and we had a blast! Even went up to the 39 floor - want to see a great view of the city and then just go down in the elevator to your room...this is it! The Westfield Mall is a 1/2 block away - great shopping and a really good food court. If we get to come back to San Fran...this is where we're staying!!"
22,2153,"Aug 26 2009 	Convenient location not ideal for business travel	The location is good if you're going to the Moscone Center or anywhere else in SoMa. It's 1 block from BART, Market Street, and Moscone Center, and across the street from the Metreon. You can walk easily to the Embarcadero from there, only about 5 blocks away. Lots of food options around the hotel's area. While the area's a step down from the Union Square area in terms of niceness (ie, there are more people asking for money in SoMa) it's by no means a bad area. The view from my room wasn't pretty; the window was facing the uglier part of SoMa. Furthermore, I was disappointed the hotel had no wireless internet, and my only option was to pay something like $14 to use their ethernet hi-speed internet. I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I successfully bid a lot lower on Priceline for it."
23,2153,"Aug 17 2009 	Couldn't have been better	We stayed here for the SF Half Marathon, and it couldn't have been better (except if the parking was free or less expensive). Location was perfect ... w/in walking distance of the Embarcadero, Union Square, etc. and easy access via BART/public transport from SFO, etc. Rooms were nice size and well appointed. All of our requests were met without having to ask twice .... staff was very accommodating and helpful. It was the perfect launch point for our weekend and made the stay even more relaxing and enjoyable."
24,2153,"Aug 14 2009 	We are suppose to go back next aug.--uuuggghh!	I hope the hotel managment reads this review!!!!Rooms::: For a hotel that is known for it's windows--please clean them. Awful.I think moths have raided the hotel and I pray they didn't get into my clothes and that I am bringing them home with me.SEROUSLY-your beds may have bedbugs. I have 2 bites that I am going to the doctor for tomorrow and if I find out they are bedbugs--you will hear from me. That is not cool.Why have you cut back on the cleaning? Cleaning is the most important part of a room....right? The vents, bedding, pillows and floor were dirty. Gross! I called the front desk 2 times to get fresh bedding and never got it. We stayed 5 nights and never once got clean sheets or bedding. Is this legal? Hotel::: PLEASE keep the bar open when there is a large convention. I promise you will make money. Ask the group staying if they think their employees would all go up to the bar --and then staff it and keep it open--otherwise we will all hang out in the lobby. WHY-WHY-WHY-WHY is it so hard to offer wi-fi in the room for free? Seriously, in todays world it's a must for us to stay there. You probably lose more customers due to the fact that you don't have it then it could ever cost you to have it. The most important thing for me is a clean room. I hope all people who stay at your hotel will review on this point. I hope that you will work for the next year to improve this. I pray that you don't have moths and bedbugs as I suspect you do. You are a Marriott-act like one. Cleanliness should be #1. Service should be #2. Rooms should be important too....please make them comfortable with towels and clean windows. Is that too hard for a Marriott? If one person reads this review and does not book with you then it was not worth it for you to NOT pay the housekeeper to clean. People do read reviews and I hope every person who reads this calls you directly to ask if you have changed your cleaning policy, if you have checked for moths and bedbugs and if you have cleaned your windows in the past month. It was a beautiful week when we were there and when you looked out our dingy windows it looked rainy and dark. It was sunny. I'm serious when I say that there was evidence of dirt in the vents, moth bites on the furniture and I pray the bites I got were not from bedbugs. Either way they were from my stay and that is gross. I pray the ice I got was clean. I didn't even think of that until after I drank my drink. Travelers, if your company books you here BRING FOOD and bleach wipes to do your own cleaning. If they improve on these items I would love for someone to write a review and tell me as I am forced to stay next Aug. with work again. Here's the good: Location - The hotel is in a great location. It's the one thing the hotel can not change. If they improve on the cleaning then this may be a good hotel. I didn't even mention there was a tray outside of my room for 24 hours with food on it. Not from me, but from the person who stayed in my room before I did. Uuuuuggghhh."
25,2153,"Aug 12 2009 	A 3 star at best!	With so many options in San Francisco, I booked with the Marriott San Francisco for a couple of reasons:1) The location was central to wll that we wanted to do2) The senior discount (my mom qualified) offered a good rate3) It wasn't as hip as some of the other choices in the area (W or Intercontinental) which is a negative for some in my party, including 3 children4) I tend to be brand loyal, as a Marriott Elite memberHowever, when I return to the city, I will look elsewhere for a couple of reasons:1) The room preferences I have (listed on my profile) were ignored. I requested a refrigerator, high floor and extra towels. I received none of these.2) My mom needed a soda when we got back to the hotel from the Giants game. it was 11:10pm. Not late for a city, right? Well, the vending machines listed as available on each floor, have been removed. The gift shop was closed. Room service was closed. The front desk clerk directed us to a 7-11 a good 10 minute walk away on Market St. I'm glad I wasn't alone, as I would have felt uncomfortable if I were. For a 4 star hotel in a major city, not being able to get something as simple as a Diet Coke after 11pm is an issue. God forbid I needed something more than that.3) By the time I got back from the 7-11, I wanted to head up to their view lounge with my husband for a drink, yet they closed at midnight! Once again, I expected more from the hotel in this respect. 4) The in room coffee was a joke. The quality was awful, with powdered creamer and Sweet and Low only. I travel with my mom a lot, and anything that is provided in-room saves me time and money, without having to venture out to get what she needs. 5) A fire drill exercise was conducted starting at 8am! The plusses of the hotel included:1) The beds were comfortable.2) The location was good if you were on foot, not so much with a car.3) The check-in and out were easy and painless4) They had an indoor pool and whirlpool for the kids.While the hotel might meed the needs of most travelers, for me, I will venture elsewhere next time."
26,2153,"Aug 9 2009 	Time for a Refresh	The location of this property is definately fantastic. Easy access to the cable cars, the BART station, and the Caltrain station. Once inside, it feels like convention central! Lots of meetings happening and lots of people standing around in the lobby. The entire hotel is in need of a major refresh. The halls are drab (no artwork or color), the guestrooms don't have wireless internet (really?? even most basic service hotels have wireless these days!), and the food was just ok.Service was pretty good. Staff was pleasant. However, when I checked in there was a room service tray belonging to the previous occupant outside my door and it stayed there for nearly 24 hours. Someone else's old dishes and unconsumed food is not a very pleasant way to welcome a guest to your property."
27,2153,"Aug 7 2009 	Excellent Location Friendly staff and Good Value!	This is great hotel to base a family trip to San Francisco. A trip to SF is not complete without a visit to Fisherman's Wharf, a Cable Car ride and a visit to the huge number of shops and this hotel is perfectly located for all. Only 2 minutes from the largest Nordstrum shopping Mall in the world, a further minute to the Powell Cable Car Station which for $5 will whisk you all the way to the Wharf. Even though everything is on your doorstep, the hotel does not feel over busy as some central city based hotels can do. The staff were 'super' friendly, the rooms were normal fare for Marriott, nice decor, good size and clean, a proper 4 star hotel. To eat with a family at the Hotel is expensive, that goes for breakfast or dinner, however you are spoilt for choice of restaurants on your doorstep so we didn't bother. The pool is a little small and is indoor, but at least they have one, many don't..Free WiFi in the bar, although we didn't see this advertised anywhere.The best feedback I can give is that I'd return here in a flash....."
28,2153,"Aug 3 2009 	Moths have hit this hotel	I'm writing this review while in my room on my last night in the hotel. I'll start with the positive elements of the San Francisco Marriott. The location is GREAT. It's walking distance to the major shopping areas (Westfield Mall, Union Square, etc.) and to Moscone Center. The rooms are large (although this isn't a major consideration for me). The cheese plate is excellent, and the room service prices are good for SFO.That being said, this hotel is aging poorly--and the management hasn't invested in keeping it up. My major complaint is the extremely poor housekeeping (which is probably driven by cost-saving measures by the management company). There are several things that lead to this suspicion: (1) short time spent actually cleaning the room--I'll get into the details below, (2) two towels/king size room, and--most egregiously, in my mind--turning off the air conditioning EVERY DAY and ignoring my preferences.First, from an investment perspective: (1) the phone by the bed was not functional, (2) the windows were so covered with grime on the outside that it was hard to tell if it was actually foggy, or if it was just the dirt, (3) the furniture was moth-bitten, (4) the linens were moth-bitten, (5) the bathroom amenities were minimal (only shampoo, conditioner, and lotion), (6) room service doesn't serve during lunch or anything after 11:00 p.m., and (7) there was NO wireless internet access in the room (you actually had to connect with a 2.5 foot cable to a modem)--so much for relaxing on the bed.Housekeeping was ridiculous. I'm on an expense account, so I'm not a penny pincher when it comes to tipping for good service. Started out with a $5 tip. Bad service. Bumped it up to $10 on the second night to see if it made a difference. Nope. Air conditioning turned off every day. Ice bucket NEVER emptied. Bed linens not changed once during a five-night stay (with no instructions on &quot;energy&quot; (read: cost) saving initiatives). Bathroom coated with scum regardless of how many nights I was here.Bottom line, I understand the desire to save costs. However, there are enough hotels out there looking to 'customize your stay' that I'd look for a property that charges the same amount but has a better in-room experience."
29,2153,"Jul 18 2009 	This Marriott's slip is showing!	Belt-tightening has caused Marriott to shut down room service at 11PM leaving nowhere in the hotel to find a morsel to eat except for the tidbits in your room costing at least $4 each plus 20% &quot;restocking fee&quot;??? and tax. Not even a vending machine! The weary traveler arriving late is directed to a diner about 1 block away. You need an armed guard to get even that far. After the sun goes down the streets are inhabited by pimps, druggies, and ladies of the night. In a further effort to economize, the Marriott offers nowhere to eat in the hotel between 11AM and 5PM. Bring your own lunch, folks!!"

The comfortable bed had a feather comforter which was cozy but a little warm for this time of year. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. There was a nice view of the SOMA area from our room. Since we got a good travel package deal on our room, we felt it was a great value for the money paid. The only snafu was the high-rise elevator didn't function one day because of the warm (!) day in SF. We didn't have to walk up to the 30th floor as they let us use the staff elevators! Have a drink in the bar on the 39th floor to enjoy the view."
31,2153,"Jul 12 2009 	Large Spacious Rooms and Superbly Located	As a Platinum Marriott member, I'm quite brand-loyal but have recently become disillusioned with the quality of several large-city Marriotts at which I've stayed. I'm delighted to say that the SFO Marriott reminded me of why I chose Marriott in the first place.The rooms - and this is the second time I've stayed here, the first when I had no status with Marriott, so it seems to be fairly standard - are very large, especially for an inner-city property. The working desk was very large and the chairs/table/bench were all very intuitively located within the room, so it felt very comfortable. Typically luxurious Marriott bedding and nice linens. Massive windows for natural light, with proper blackout curtains so you can sleep in if you're lucky enough to have a morning off. And thankfully this venue doesn't have that dreadful Citrus range of Marriott Bath and Body Works toiletries - the range here was creamy and herby rather than smelling like commerical cleaning products.The real bonus of this property is the location! Within a five minute walk of all the downtown shopping you could possibly want, and only a short walk to the BART if you want to go further afield. I travel about 50% of the time and would be dead if I ate hotel food every day/night. So the other thing I hugely appreciate about this property is the proximity to the wonderful Bristol Farms supermarket (in the shopping centre about three doors down). Amazing pre-prepared food from sushi to hot meals, a full grocery store complete with marvelous produce. The Marriott will provide an in-room refrigerator at no charge, so unlike many venues you can self-cater with some healthy food with a minimum of hassle.  At night there's the usual array of homeless around the venue , but in downtown San Francisco this is pretty standard. They're going to be outside all your shopping venues, so you're going to deal with it anyway. It's not dangerous - more a nuisance.The concierge lounge is lovely, with the usual array of teas, coffees, and a decent breakfast. One of the better breakfast services I've experienced. Fruit, yoghurt, eggs, plenty of breads and bagels etc. Shame the same can't be said of the evening service. The chicken strips disappeared and were not replenished after the first 45 minutes. So if you came after work (who's ever done with work by 5pm when travelling?) there was really nothing left except some mangy veggie leftovers and well-used dressing. The spring rolls were more plentiful, largely because nobody ate them. Oily, revolting and really shouldn't be there. When I asked about the chicken, the concierge (who was generally delightful but missed the mark on this particular issue) said &quot;You just need to get here earlier!&quot;. The service is meant to go from 5.30 to 7pm (from memory) so this was a bit rough, in my view, for 6.10pm when I arrived.The in-house restaurant is OK, but has a limited selection, especially if you don't want fish, seafood or steak. There's plenty of choice around the hotel, and I'd strongly recommend the Bistro (Annabelle's) across the street - superb European quality food at reasonable restaurant prices. Ignore the bar, which looks divey, and head straight to the tables - you won't be disappointed. I had two appetizers for dinner - carpaccio and black bean soup - both of which were superb. And the wine list is quite good.Large rooms and you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. Highly recommended. I'm currently staying at another Marriott inner-city property (Philadelphia which I shall review when I check out in a week's time) and it's utterly hideous. This prompted me to go online and positively review San Francisco. It really is an excellent property."
32,2153,"Jul 11 2009 	Average at best paying purely for location	The lobby, service and overall cleanliness of this hotel are fine, and really you cannot beat the location of this hotel in San Francisco. However I couldn't help myself while staying here for a few days for a conference (and knowing the nightly rate), realizing that I would never pay this much for the quality of the hotel. The room and overall feel of the hotel all seemed outdated and rather early 90's nouveux riche; kind of like trying to be the cool, hip and fancy hotel, but falling well behind the times. My suggestion would be to find a more unique hotel in a decent location and save a chunk of money."
33,2153,Jul 11 2009 	A very good hotel	We have stayed at the Marriott at least four times while in SF for a long weekend. It is good hotel for a three day weekend in SF.
34,2153,"Jul 7 2009 	Nice stay overall...Just beware of not answering your wake up call	Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights last week(6/27 to 7/2) while at a conference. Hotel is very nice and room was in very good condition. Stayed in the low rise section of the hotel(7 floors) and never waited more than a few seconds for an elevator. I know it is not an easy job to keep clean, but the windows were filthy(not that my view was that great, but still). I did not eat at the hotel at all during my stay. Went up to the bar at the top of the hotel one night for a couple of drinks. Outstanding views of the city. Did not have a car, but I noticed the hotel parking was $50+ per day. Many restaurants and stores within a few blocks. No wireless access in the hotel rooms, not even for a fee.Now to my big complaint...One morning I did not get my wake-up call. After I woke up late, I was in the bathroom and someone started pounding(I mean pounding) on my door repeatedly. I got out of the bathroom, answered the door and found a hotel security guard there. He proceeds to rudely blurt out &quot;You didn't answer your wake up call and we wanted to make sure you weren't dead&quot;. Before I could say anything, he turns around and walks away. I called the front desk and they said this was hotel policy. I asked if it was hotel policy to have the guard say &quot;I wanted to make sure you weren't dead&quot; to which they replied that they will talk to the guard."
35,2153,"Jul 6 2009 	Clean and Quiet	Hotel was lovely, clean, quiet and safe. Location was perfect, less than block away from cable car turnaround. Would stay there again."
36,2153,"Jul 1 2009 	OK for biz not for fun	We actually did not stay at this Marriott the night we had reservations with a friends and family discount, we walked around the corner to the Palace Hotel instead. The desk clerk was rude, inefficient, and wasted so much of our time verifying that our discount was real that we had to skip our dinner plans.We have had very good experiences in Marriotts abroad and in the US, so thought we would try one in our home city. There are so many nice hotels in SF to choose from, no point in bothering to try to stay here, unless you are hosting a corporate event (it is large and well located) or you want an indoor pool, which the Palace and several other hotels have as well."
37,2153,"Jun 14 2009 	First choice for San Francisco downtown!	I've stayed at the Marriott a few times now in San Francisco. While it's not the best hotel I've ever stayed in there's very little to fault with it in my opinion. It has a great location right next to the Moscone Centre on one side and downtown on the other. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.The lobby was being refurbished during my stay in April 08 but this has now been completed and the hotel lobby is once again large, bright and airy. One thing to note is that this is a very large hotel with lots of people around at all times - I personally like this and find the staff still give great service. The hotel seems to be used quite a bit with conference delegates.The rooms are of a good size with the usual Marriott comfortable beds and large LCD TVs. Room service is quick and they provide a good selection of tasty meals. The restaurant is good for a quick bite to eat at lunchtime and also has a great selection for breakfast.My only slight criticism is the lack of wifi in the rooms. I use the wired internet connection but this can't be used with devices such as the iPhone.While at the hotel make sure you check out the bar on the top floor - the views are spectacular."
38,2153,"Jun 7 2009 	My new favorite hotel in San Francisco	I had such a great experience at the Marriott San Francisco. My husband and I went to the city for my 30th birthday, we stayed at the new Intercontinental on Howard the night before. I got a Saturday night stay for $103 plus tax through Marriott's website. The check in experience was one of the best ever, we were offerred an upgrade for $20, but when I opted out, the desk guy gave us a room on the 26th floor anyway. We had a great view of the city and a spacious room. The food and cocktails at The View lounge on the 39th floor was fantastic. We had the antipasti tray that was awesome, with wonderful flat bread, fancy salami and cured meats, cheese, olives, sundried tomateos ($14). I had a signature drink, the Crystal Slipper that was tasty and stout ($14). The chairs and couches are plush, looking out right over the city and Bay. The waitresses were so nice and attentive, very down to Earth. The heavenly beds good to sleep-in on a Sunday morning. Then I hit the gym, did some laps in the perfect temperature pool, and relaxed in the jacuzzi. The gym is great, personal TVs on each machine, lots of new LifeFitness equipment and weights. The Intercontinental was also great, but was more expensive: $119 for Friday night, $137 for saturday, and their resaturant is very pricey. Our room was bigger at the Marriott too. For my money, I'd rather go back to the Marriott, it's a better value.Park right across the street at the 5th and Mission Yerba Buena garage, $30 for 12-24 hours."
39,2153,"Jun 5 2009 	Really Great....	What can I say...my favorite hotel in San Francisco...and I've stayed at 5 thus far. A bit expensive but great rooms, great service and great location...Oh and a great lounge on the top floor with an AMAZING view of the city. Great place to stay."
40,2153,"May 21 2009 	Great location	Got this hotel through Priceline and was given a huge room on the 17th floor. It had a living area, desk and bar area. The location is fantastic...if you are into shopping. It is across from the Westfield Mall, Barneys is a block away, right in the heart of everything. The only downside is parking which is very expensive."
41,2153,"May 20 2009 	Excellent choice for a convention	We stayed ther for a convention in Moscone Convention Center. Location! Location! Location. The hotel is huge. Service is not the key, but you get what you pay for. The view in the top floor bar is unique and a must see! The pool was closed for inspection and remodeling."
42,2153,"May 19 2009 	Nice hotel	The hotel is in a great area for exploring the city. Right across Market St. from Union Square and only a couple blocks to the cable car stop that will take you to Fisherman's Wharf. The only complaint I have is that the beds were way too small. My husband and I went with our 16 year old daughter and got a room with two double beds. I guess I'm just used to hotel rooms having queen beds so these just seemed so small. Next time, for a family of three, I would get a King room and have a roll-away brought in. Check in was fast and the staff was very friendly. Be prepared to pay alot for parking - $55 for registered guests."
43,2153,"May 13 2009 	Great location super value perfect for families 55 South St SFO	Great location, super value, perfect for families - we stayed laster at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square and actually felt this was more convenient and roomy - esp for the shopping. Starbucks on ground floor."
44,2153,"May 11 2009 	Avoid this place at all costs	My husband and I traveled to the west coast for a family reunion. We decided to make a vacation out of it and spent 4 days in gorgeous San Francisco. But our trip didn't start off that great. We had reserved that hotel because of the indoor pool; we found out it was being serviced and we would not be able to use it or the jacuzzi during our stay. The clerk didn't even apologize, and why didn't I get an email letting me know ahead of time that the hotel would be partially under construction. Then, we were mortified that when we arrived at the hotel, at midnight, there was a half empty bottle of water on the floor next to the bed (which made me think no one changed the sheets) and dried pee on the toilet seat- which made me think nothing in the room was clean. I called down to the desk to let them know the room wasn't clean and all the desk clerk kept saying way, &quot;I'll make sure housekeeping doesn't charge you for the water.&quot; After he finally understood, and after a long flight, (and it was actually 3AM for us) we followed the bellman around the hotel looking for a clean room. We had reserved a room with 1 king bed, they then put us in a room with 2 beds. My husband and I don't fit in a double bed but they said that was all they had that was clean- but when I checked in and asked if the hotel was busy, they said they barely had 30% of the hotel occupied. Anyways, after 1 hour they finally found us a room that was correct and appeared clean. They didn't have a room key so they said they would slide it under the door. The next morning, we left the room but forgot something; we tried the room key they slid under the door and it didn't work. I asked a housekeeper to let us in, but she wouldn't- that was understandable, she pointed to the phone outside the elevator so I used it to call the desk. They said they would send someone up. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we finally got into the room. There was no apology or anything, in fact they tried to blame us by saying we must have demagnetized it. The customer service was awful. We decided to check out and find another hotel. Our initial reservation was for 4 nights, and even though we checked out after 1 night, the clerk didn't even ask us why. I would assume in this economy, they could use every red cent they could get."
45,2153,"May 5 2009 	Good place to stay in the city	We stayed here in the city for a family wedding event. It is conveniently located near so many things. The Sony metreon is right next door, lots of shopping with in an easy walk. China town and little Italy is only a 10-20 min walk away. Union square is only a few blocks away.  The hotel has nice people who amply provide information and directions all of our interactions were very pleasant. Parking is expensive but the valets are quick, helpful and very nice plus your car is safer here than in the other public lots. The omelet chef at the mission caf on the 2nd floor is great and the buffet was very good.Another plus is the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Company located just around the corner from the hotel."
46,2153,"May 2 2009 	Great hotel for a biz trip to San Francisco	I stayed here because the meeting I was attending was at the hotel. The only thing at all out of sorts was the very slow service at the 39th floor lounge during a 'reception' that was held there. I found the hotel is very conveniently located and everything was ideal for a business trip.Also, I got a fantastic rate through an Expedia package that I booked only two weeks prior to my stay."
47,2153,Apr 1 2009 	Great Location but pricey	Recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on a business trip. The hotel is very large and modern. Lots of conventions going on with hundreds of people always in the lobby. Very busy but service was still good.They gym was very nice with lots of machines and free weights to chose from. Easy walk to great food and shopping accross the street. $10 taxi or $1.50 street car trip down to fishermans warf and Alcatraz tours. Nice place to stay but was rather pricey $289 per night plus tax.
48,2153,"Mar 18 2009 	Friendly helpful staff in great location	The Marriott San Francisco Downtown is in a great location and this says a lot. The concierge folks outside are very attentive and seem to provide a sense of security that is necessary for the visitor from afar. The hotel also has separate high rise and mid rise elevators making it always a short wait for the next elevator and the hotel is within walking distance of all that san francisco has to offer - nightly, complimentary entertainment of the variety show variety ; 4 blocks to chinatown and maybe 30 minutes to the airport in a shuttle probably 20 in a taxi during the week. Be prepared to spend money, but the access to everything from convenience stores outside to shopping is all there. Across the street from a Bloomingdales department store as well as numerous other fine hotels and most likely fine nightspots and dayspots for that matter if you're looking for an adult beverage. The adjoining rooms have thin walls, be careful if you are a light sleeper."
49,2153,"Mar 8 2009 	Great location View Lounge is incredible!	This hotel is perfectly located for accessing all San Francisco has to see. It's very convenient to Union Square shopping, cable cars are right around the corner with China Town and Fisherman's wharf just a ride away. The hotel is large but I found front desk staff to be very helpful and attentive. Having a cocktail in the View Lounge at sunset is an absolute must, even though the drinks are pricey. I guess $14 (plus tip) for a cocktail is worth it though, given the magnificent 360 degree view! The few minor issues I had with my room (broken ethernet cable, no bathrobe, and malfunctioning hairdryer) were all immediately rectified by staff. The only complaints I would have is that the rooms are a bit small and the food in this hotel is limited and quite expensive. Eat out - there are lots of great restaurants nearby. Overall a nice hotel."
50,2153,"Feb 16 2009 	Awesome location	Hotel is centrally located, literally across the street from Metreon and Yerba Buena gardens. We stayed here for 2 nights and will stay here again. Staff is very professional, polite and friendly. I asked if they could hold our luggage until check in time and they offered us early check in and great room on the 21. floor."
51,2153,"Feb 7 2009 	Nice Hotel with Modern Rooms	We stayed at the San Francisco Marriott for 5 nights while attending a conference and paid $219/night (which was better than the conference rate).We stayed in a regular room (#2261) and were pleased to find a modern and what appeared to be a renovated room.The concierge was great and knew all the great places to eat. If you like great Sushi without paying for the ambiance, try Sakana, which is within walking distance.The location is near Market street and all the shops, near Union Square and close to the Market Street Trolly which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf. The trolly is $5/per person. The F street bus is also convenient ($1.50/per person).The fitness center is the best thing about this property with all the great equipment.Our only complaint is that they charge $12.95/day for internet in your room. However, it is free in the lobby.This hotel is a high 3 star/solid 4 star property with nice staff."
52,2153,"Jan 30 2009 	Nice hotel but understandibly impersonal	We stayed here for two nights upon arriving in San Francisco before setting off on our road trip.Location:The hotel is well located for shopping and main business section of the city. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to pier 39, but is a pleasant walk.Issues:NothingPositives:Nothing spectacular - the hotel was lovely but very big.Restaurant:We ate one meal in the restaurant - it was a nice location within the hotel although not particularly private. Food was good and prices reasonable. Service was friendly.Room:Our room was spacious and clean. Large wooden desk with plasma tv and a large bathroom.Other comments:Don't use the internet in the lobby - it cost us a fortune!! Other than that, a nice hotel. The prices varied massively - we paid about $199 per night (100 at the time) but then when we tried to book for two weeks later, it was around $400!! Not worth that!"
53,2153,"Jan 20 2009 	Okay I Guess But Nothing Special	At a conference recently and would say that staying here has its strengths and weaknesses. Good points: Easy to walk to convention center and cheaper restaurants (because the hotel's is ridiculously overpriced), not far from Union Square, and only like 10 minute cable car ride to Fisherman's Wharf. Second, if you didn't mind spending extra for food and drink the Marriott has plenty of options. Bad Points: For $300 a night I was expecting more and wasn't overwhelmed by anything at this hotel other than it's inflated price. Also, we weren't exactly pleased that they could not honor our request for a king size bed and that made the sleeping not so good. Overall I wouldn't say I had a bad experience but it certainly wasn't the best I've ever had either. I'm very thankful the company footed the bill on this one because I wouldn't have felt satisfied for the rate being charged."
54,2153,"Jan 19 2009 	Great service...expensive food!	I stayed at the San Franscisco Marriott for a two-day business meeting. Service at the hotel was excellent. Check-in was quick, and the room was great. Clean and without scents (my pet peeve of hotels: deodorizers and room &quot;fresheners&quot;). Thank you! The room had a great view of the bay, and two windows that partially opened, allowing in some fresh air. My only complaint about the room was a lack of towel bars in the bathroom. I shared this room, and there was no place to hang towels that could be reused. The TV remote did not work, but after a call to the desk, a maintenance worker showed up with a new one in less than 10 minutes. The next night a request for ice was fulfilled in the same prompt manner. Great service. The price for food for the conference and in the hotel restaurant was astonishing; almost absurd. With the service charge and gratuity, a sack lunch of sandwich with sides was an amazing $50 per person!!! Location was perfect; near everything in downtown."
55,2153,"Jan 9 2009 	Disappointing	We've stayed at the San Francisco Marriott on business and for family weekend getaways many times. Last year they remodeled the bar/lounge/lobby areas, but not for the better. The large comfortable lounge at the top of the stairs is now an empty space, presumably to be used for events. The new bar is disappointingly lacking in character and the service was terrible. Slow, unhelpful and with no ability to answer questions about the bar menu. The food, when it came finally, was almost inedible. Our room was a disappointment too. It was right opposite the elevator lobby, had a huge crack in the sink, and there were used coffee cups on the vanity counter. We were only staying one night and didn't have time to move rooms. I contacted the hotel management after our stay to let them know about the problems and have not heard anything from them. We're Marriott Reward members and would have expected some kind of response. We're going to look for another hotel in SF for our next visit."
56,2153,"Jan 7 2009 	Disappointed	We chose to stay at the SF Marriott having stayed there on several occasions prior (2008, 2006, 2004). Unfortunately this time we were not at all happy with our stay and will definitely not stay there again. The hotel is in a good location (heart of the downtown shopping area, however we have found that the overall standard of the hotel and the cleanliness has deteriorated over time. The rooms are exactly the same as when we stayed in 2004 and despite paying extra for a room upgrade, the room we were given certainly was not 'superior' and the amenities felt like it was the entry level room type. Cleanliness of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired with the bathroom not cleaned to a satisfactory level (hair on the floor, dirty toilet). My main concern and disappointment came when upon leaving our room on two occasions I noticed one of the hotel cleaners styling her hair in a guest room with the hairdryer. Once the cleaner noticed me looking, she promptly pushed the door shut - makes you wonder what happens in your hotel room when you are not there. I found this service to be unacceptable and very unprofessional. On several occasions during our stay we also checked our bill for the room to review our charges and noted that the hotel had charged us for internet useage we had not used. We brought this up with the front desk on several occasions and it was not rectified until check out where we had to justify that it be removed as we had not used the service. There are several other hotels in similar location which we will choose from when next travelling to San Francisco. We will definitely not be staying at the Marriott again."
57,2153,"Jan 2 2009 	Fantastic	Great location and service. The concierge, Dan, was particularily helpful. Would return in a heartbeat.Casey - Vancouver BC"
58,2153,"Dec 19 2008 	unparalleled location	Got this hotel from Priceline and it was at an astonishing rate of sub $100 (before tax). For that weekend I was in SF, $100 could probably be a motel's rate...Hotel location is unparalleled. Half a block to BART Powell station 4th street entrance. 1 block to to Westfield San Francisco Center (and Bloomingdale's) with lots of shops in between, particularly a giant Old Navy store and 2 blocks to Union Square. Its the perfect place when you wanna shop in SF and be right in the middle of the happening.The hotel was pretty good but I'd say its slightly inferior to the Marriotts I've stayed in Asia Pacific. I was given 24th floor with a east side view. Glimpse of the Oakland Bay Bridge in the dawn was nice. Managed to talk to my way to have access to the Club Lounge on the 18th floor. Watching sunrise there in the morning was... nice! :)"
59,2153,"Dec 15 2008 	Nice All Around Place to Stay	We stayed at the SF Marriott on Dec 8 - 12th and had beautiful sunny days each day of our stay which made the trip that much more enjoyable. The Marriott is a very large hotel, but you really don't feel its size going through the fairly small lobby to the elevators and to your room. We had a 20th floor room looking to the west which was not that great of a view, but not the worst either. They did not have a king room available for early check-in, but let us get a two bed room at noon on a very busy Monday which we jumped at knowing how tired we were from the early morning flight to SF. The location is great right next to the San Francisco Shopping Centre and right on the corner of the Union Square shopping district. It is a very convenient walk just around the corner from the BART station (30 minute ride to and from the airport) and to numerous bus/trolley lines. You are also right next door to the convention center and two big movie theaters. The hotel room was a bit small, but nicely furnished. Plenty of room in the bathroom and we were to get a small fridge for the stay free from the front desk which helped. They have a mini bar, but if you remove anything you are charged an arm and a leg for it. The room was &quot;Wired&quot; for technology which was nice to be able to plug my iPhone into the TV to watch videos or listen to music. However, you need to bring your own cables for this. Cables are provided for a network connection and to hook your portable up to the TV screen (nice 32 inch LCD panel). The high speed internet that they advertise was incredibly slow (about 400 k download from all the test I did) and costs $12.95 per day. Food choices at the hotel are limited to a Starbucks in the lobby, an expensive steak restaurant, a bar and possibly one other small restaurant we didn't really see. There are many places very close to the hotel like Mel's Diner, Denny's, the food court at the Mall and all the other restaurants in the shopping district. A nice Whole Foods is a few blocks south of the hotel for those wanting to pick some things up. Overall it was a nice hotel to stay in with the main negatives being the internet speed, smallish room and limited food options at the hotel. Everything else was very nice and we would definitely stay there again."
60,2153,"Nov 17 2008 	Good Time in San Francisco	Stayed at the SF Marriott for the Folsom Street Fair. The location was very nice. Easy to walk to shopping on Market, easy to get to the BART subway system. Staff was very nice."
61,2153,Nov 9 2008	safe choice	Very conveniently located in the heart of the cit by the convention center. The hotel is enormous but well run. It is clean and well maintained. There are no surprises and that is why I like Marriott chains and this place is typical of Marriott Hotels but it is just big. You really can't go wrong choosing this hotel.
62,2153,Oct 22 2008 	Good Stay by The Bay	The good: Very fast check in. Friendly and efficient staff. Room service dinner was fast and tasted good for  hotel food. The area is has plenty to do and is close to BART.The bad: Never got the 4am wake-up call I asked for and almost missed my departing flight. Checked in late and had things all over the bed when  I left the room the 1st day so I put the do not disturb  sign up. It didn't matter has housekeeping still  entered the room and cleaned it and moved things around.The hotel is fantastic if you need to be in the financial district but it's almost so big and impersonal that if the hotel errors the response given is more ho-hum then trying to get it right.
63,2153,Oct 18 2008 	Good Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for a conference. Room was comfortable and clean. Staff seemed friendly and anxious to help. Area around hotel is great with plenty to do. Restaurants around hotel are great and much cheaper than hotel.My only major complaint was the cost of food in the hotel. I almost ordered breakfast one morning and then realized french toast was $18!!! I walked 2mins outside and found a great diner and had breakfast for a fraction of the cost.Shopping center across from hotel had great gourmet food options for other meals as well. Liquor store around the corner had beer and wine for a great evening.
64,2153,"Oct 12 2008 	Nice hotel - just so big!	Note that I'm a Marriott Platinum member (I stay 100+ nights/year in Marriotts so my experience might not be typical)Stayed here for the start of a 3 day holiday around California. First impressions were very good, a busy lobby (busy any time of day as I later noticed) - swift check-in (even though we arrived a few hours before the standard check-in time due to our flight arrival time. Had a room on about the 18th (Conceirge) floor, had a nice view down onto the convention centre below where they were putting up tents for Oracle World (A convention) in a small park. The room was small but cosy, lovely Marriott bed (as always) and a reasonable size bathroom. The TV was a nice high definition one which you could enjoy from your bed easily and also swivelled. Other than that nothing special - would be ideal for business but probably not a luxary stay. The concerige lounge was nice enough, though surprisingly busy, had a nice view of the same park and a nice breakfast.We also tried to go to 'The view', the bar on the top floor of the hotel, but it was too busy (We had chosen about 8pm on Saturday) - but it looked nice and quite dramatic, would have been nice to have an informal drink here before dinner I'd have thought. Finally, we also used the pool - it wasn't busy at all (we were the only ones there), although it wasn't that warm. Strangely all the people on the 4th-6th floors can look into the pool area. More to mind, if this hotel has 1,500 rooms then the pool can only accomodate about 15 people easily, so, it could get crowded. Sadly the jacuzi wasn't working on our trip - but the same concept applies in that it is small for so many people.On our last day we picked up a car from Hertz in the lobby - easy and simple though we were surprised that there was a compulsory $10 fee for the valet to pick it up (normally this is why you pay extra for Hertz for a hotel pickup?), but, leaving was then easily acomplished straight onto the street - though the valet parking is hidden away inside the hotel so you can load/unload rather than being on the street as with other hotels in the area.I also stayed at the JW Marriott during the same trip, as it is smaller I would prefer that for any future stay - though if going to the Moscone convention centre, as this Marriott is right next door to it, that would be an ideal place to stay, or for business, rather than a special holiday."
65,2153,"Oct 9 2008 	Three Years in a Row...	Year three in San Francisco at the Marriott for our Fall Show. The sevice has improved slightly in three years - but strangely so. We had several meeting rooms subterranean, so many red-coated young people asked if everything was ok...We had very attentive service from MANY people. Not one person returned for a second check! Security issues still abound at the SF Marriott!One of our colleagues witnessed two teenagers coupling in the pool - and after gathering his children and sheilding them from the porn show - complained to several people (including our &quot;red-coated&quot; attendees) and nothing was done. Apparently this hotel allows people to walk in off the street and use the facilities. Homeless people walk through the driveway area and harrass the guests (smokers) while the parking attendants pay no attention. Yes, the hotel is convenient to shopping and the convention center and streetcar, blah, blah - but if I had a choice, I would pick a boutique hotel that is $200/night cheaper!"
66,2153,"Sep 28 2008 	Good - for under $300	This is your typical big city, big hotel. Very effective and many services available. Great Gym and the rooms are more then fine. The sky bar or whatever its called is very touristy and service is horrible. Besides that the hotel is filled with conventioneers due to its proximity to the moscone center. The location is great near Union square and a 10 minute walk from the Ferry Building. Didnt try any of the restaurants in the hotel but the concierge recommendation was so, so"
67,2153,"Sep 23 2008 	Great Stay!	Got a great deal on a room through priceline ($150 tax and service included). The room we were assigned was absolutely amazing. A corner room with a king bed and wall to wall views of the hills and the bay. I personally really enjoy how Marriott uses down comforters with a washable sheet cover. Having a wife that works in a hotel, the first thing we usually do is strip the bed of the blanket since, if you're not aware, those things only get washed every few months and are absolutely disgusting at most hotels. Not so at Marriotts and a few other hotels that have switched to this method of bedding. Regardless, everything else was fantastic. The concierge and the bellmen were very professional. Getting us reservations and calling ahead for meals as well as watching our bags while we shopped on our final day. All around a fantastic experience."
68,2153,"Sep 23 2008 	Great location	The hotel is in a good downtown location with easy access to plenty of bars and restaurants, as well as the superb local transport system. We stayed in a standard room which was very good. The hotel has a really good gym. Prices in the hotel are rather high for drinks and breakfast, but plenty of places nearby offering cheaper alternatives. Don't bother with a car - it's simple and cheap to use the buses and trams to get about.Would definitely visit again if I'm lucky enough to get the chance."
69,2153,"Sep 20 2008 	Good Location for Convention; not the greatest room	Location is excellent for conventions at Moscone Center. It is within easy walking distance to the Convention Center and located near several nice places to eat (also walking distance). I had a room on the 5th floor that I felt was below average for a Marriott. The room itself was average, but the bathroom was a disaster. The tile floor was chipped and cracked and had an &quot;L&quot; sticker (assuming this was from a previous guests new shirt) stuck right in the middle of the floor. It stayed there for my entire stay (4 nights) which indicated to me that the floor was not being cleaned. Also, there was hair clippings in the soap indentations in the shower ... ewwww! I left a generous tip for housekeeping hoping things would get cleaned up, but no such luck. On a positive note, the TV was outstanding. I am not usually impressed by TV's, but I watched a football game with some friends on one of the room TV's and we were all very impressed by the quality of the room TV."
70,2153,"Sep 16 2008 	Great hotel awesome location 	We just stayed at the San Francisco Marriott for several days and our visit was was outstanding. We chose this property even though the JW came much more highly recommended. We were lucky enough to get on a high floor (35th) - and it was a corner room. The views of the city and San Francisco Bay were spectacular. The Marriott staff was wonderful. The top floor for drinks was incredible - very highly recommended, even if it is a bit expensive, it's worth it. BTW - if you're coming from a big city, you'll think the prices are normal. The location - we could not have asked for better. Shopping, shopping, shopping - all within steps. Transportation - a very short block away and the streetcar let us off when returning from the Wharf right across the street from our hotel. I don't think it could have been any more convenient. The lobby was always full of people - coming and going. Hustle and bustle - we like that. For anyone who is a Gold or Platinum member, the Concierge Lounge is open all weekend (JW is not). The views from the Concierge Lounge on the 18th floor - the city and the bay. Wow. The **only** drawback is that you do have to pay for Internet. There is a $7.95 basic cost and a $12.95 cost. Go with the $7.95 - it was perfectly fine. Marriott does need to get on board and start offering free WI-FI, just like so many other properties. Bottom line is that this hotel is highly, highly recommended. :)"
71,2153,"Sep 6 2008 	I'd go back again at this price	At $149 (Labor Day weekend), the Marriott was OK. There were minor problems, like a toilet seat that would not always stay up and some street noise in our 14th floor room.Comfortable beds, lousy pillows.Little hall noise, but what there was came right through the door.No noise from neighboring rooms, but no sign they were occupied.Close to BART from the airport. $50/day parking. Good central location for mass transit."
72,2153,"Aug 20 2008	Great location	As mentioned by many other reviewers, the location is very convenient. The hotel is what you would expect from a Marriott. Beds were very comfortable. The room was clean and efficiently structured. Room was prepared in advance as &quot;feather-free&quot; as requested, which was much appreciated. Fitness facility is top notch. Only complaint was with the concierge facility. The facility is poorly designed from a seating arrangement perspective and they have trouble accommodating everyone. Staff always seemed in a rush to clear everyone out at the end of each service period. They did not replenish breakfast items as they ran out and they ran out of dessert items before 9:30, when dessert was suppose to last until 10:00. Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
73,2153,"Aug 17 2008 	Average Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for a business trip.My room was average, nothing special about it at all.The windows were dirty on the outside and the view wasn't that impressive (I was on the ninth floor overlooking other buildings). The conference area is in the basement of the hotel so there are no windows. That starts to get to you on a 6 day business trip in meetings all days. The location wasn't too bad. I walked just about everywhere, but there is also lots of public transoprtation and shopping near by.Overall the hotel is fine, but nothing that makes it special or above average in my opinion."
74,2153,"Aug 17 2008 	Great Service Wonderful Stay	In late July, the San Francisco Marriott hosted the 2008 Romance Writers of America Conference - &quot;Romance, Bridging the World.&quot; We could not have visited a better city, or hotel. From the time we arrived a few days before the conference until check-out a week later, we felt at ease. From bellhop to maid service to concierge, the staff was quiet, unobtrusive, and always ready to meet our needs. Rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable. Beds were great. Our conference meeting rooms were always neatly set up with water available. Our meals were tasty, and the service absolutely excellent. We loved The View, Marriott's lounge on the 39th Floor. A little pricey but what an incredible place to enjoy a glass of wine and good company! There is also a tucked-away rooftop garden on the 5th floor, just off the pool but accessible from a hallway. Once the conference got underway, in a hotel filled with almost 2,000 romance writers, it made a relaxing spot to unwind. One drawback was that Internet access in the guest rooms was an added $12.95, on top of the already big city room rates. Wireless was free on the first floor and there is a lounge area with tables off the lounge but that meant lugging the laptop down each evening. If lesser hotels (at lesser rates) can offer free internet (wired or wireless) in rooms, why couldn't the SF Marriott? I do hope they reconsider this in the future. Still, it was the only negative in an otherwise perfect stay.  Thank you, Marriott, and the RWA Board for booking us there."
75,2153,"Aug 9 2008 	Check your bill for incorrect charges	Stayed at this hotel for a business convention Aug 3 through Aug 7-total of 4 nights. Checked in at front desk and was told I was assigned 19th floor/city view, handicap room. Advised front desk I did not require such a room and they should reassign that type of room to another traveler with special needs. Reassigned the 11th floor/King size bed. Room was big, clean, and well laid out. Room Service and wake up calls great. Wednesday around Noon I returned to my room to find a worker about to set up a carpet cleaning machine...WHY ? I told him to leave since I needed to make some phone calls. He must have come back later because the carpet appeared to have been cleaned. I checked out Thursday and did not look at my bill close enough. On Wednesday, there was a charge made against my room for the Refreshment Center for $10.96. Guess who helped themselves to a beverage !!! I called the hotel billing number and they stated the bill would be adjusted. It alarms me to know that people are coming in and out of my hotel room and things are being charged without my knowlege. I expect more from Marriot and so should the public. As for San Francisco; its a nice city with some wonderful places to visit."
76,2153,"Aug 7 2008 	Very close to everything via San Fran Transportation Systen	We were there for six nights for a convention. This hotel has a great location and we could walk to Bart, bus, and trolleys, Cable cars are also close by but use only if you are a first time visitor to San Francisco....the wait if too long for anything but a one time ride. No one we were with, ate breakfast in the hotel, it was too expensive. We went diagonally across the street to Mels Diner where you could get breakfast for $10 a personDrinks in the 39th foor lounge are a one-time must but very expensive as is the bar downstairs. The &quot;sports&quot; bar on the corner is owned by the Marriott but is less expensive for cocktails. A lot of people also ate there. We didn't so can not give a review. Please check my restauarant reviews...we had some fantastic meals including Frascati, which any of you &quot;foodies&quot; will love.This was your standard four star convention/business hotel with a lot of activity in the lobby (which I like). Room was very clean and beds were soooo comfortable. Since we had another week down in San Diego and had four suitcases we did ask for a corner room since we couldn't fit in luggage and clothes. By the day after check-in they had accomodated us.We would stay there again."
77,2153,"Jul 29 2008 	Good hotel but expensive	This is pretty much what you expect from a Marriott - nice rooms, nice hotel, but a bit overpriced. I'm not talking about the rates as I always book through priceline but am talking about their bars/restaurants/convenience store. 14 for a cocktail is a bit much. 42 is the cheapest bottle of wine you can get and that's for regular stuff. Cheese plate for 12 that gives you maybe 6 pieces of cheese. I would say if you want a nice place to stay go here but bring all your own stuff. Avoid the bistro/bar accross the street - is pretty crappy. There is a sports bar on the same street just down from it - try there."
78,2153,"Jul 26 2008	Kids Looove it!	Major marriott member. Stayed on award points.GREAT location for business - right near market st. and convention center. Stayed for a 'staycation' near home. Most of the action for tourists is a $15 taxi ride away - no big. But DON'T walk around outside at night. You won't be robbed, but it's ugly.I HATE the lobby of this hotel - it's small, round, with a marble floor that echos disconcertingly. But you're not there for very long. Nice layout with a restaurant in a high-rise atrium up a set of escalators. Really nice, but why eat there if you are in SF?The room was fine/nice with everything I expect at a Marriott, including the shower that should have been replaced when they renovated the hotel.I'd LOVE to stay here on business."
79,2153,"Jul 17 2008 	Just as expected	My husband and I stayed here last week for 4 nights. He was attending a conferance there, it was our first time in the city. This was the perfect location for us, as I could keep myself entertained while he was working. Everything is very close and easy walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. I did not enjoy the breakfasts at the hotel, food was poor quality. Instead I regularly went to the upscale food court across the street in the lower lever of Westfield Mall, great selection and good value. I fell in love with the cream puffs from Bearded Papa, made fresh all day. The hotel is a heavily used conference hotel, and therefore, very busy and average quality. However, we were pleased with the service and staff were all helpful. We spent very little time in the room, so the location was key for this trip. Would recommend based on this factor alone."
80,2153,"Jul 7 2008 	Perfect Location	This hotel is right across from the Metreon and a block from the new Nordstrom's mall (Westfield). Couldn't be more convenient to see a movie at the Imax or regular theatre, ice skate or bowl at Yerba Buena, shop at the mall, and walk a few blocks to Union Square. For tourist families, it's ideal! The staff were incredibly friendly and we never had any problems with cleanliness or service.Family things within a block or so:--movies (one at Metreon and one at Westfield)--ice skating--Yerba Buena park--bowling--Zeum--MOMA--cable car station--BART stationWe actually took MUNI to the wharf, but you can also take the cable cars. Easy $1.50 on the old Italian(?) buses to get to Fisherman's Wharf, Maritime Park area, Ferry Building, Pier 39, or Ghirardelli Square. Kids were $0.50.Hotel negative: The only thing is that they charge $55 for parking for the night. Figure that in to your total price for the night--most hotels charge a lot, so I guess I was used to it."
81,2153,"Jul 2 2008 	Nice Hotel and Well-Positioned for Sightseeing!	We were at a huge convention at this Marriott, and for a hotel of this size, we were very impressed. Efficient check-in (surprise!), quality housekeepers, big enough fitness center, and within walking distance (or streetcar/BART/metro distance) to everything you'd want. Good place to stay."
82,2153,"Jun 23 2008	Average Food Dirty Floors Good Gym	The good points: lots of very large drawers and good closet space for unpacking; fast reliable internet if you take the $12.95 package; fast elevators and lots of them; very good gym and equipment. The location is good but the same could be said of dozens of other hotels in the area. Annabelle's restaurant across the street is fabulous, go there rather than room service, or go to the gourmet fast food which is all excellent in the lower level of the Westfield shopping centre, across the street 2 minutes. But avoid Mel's diner down the street.Won't stay here again because: bathroom floor was filthy with clumps of earth on checkin, and stayed dirty for the 3 days; carpets not vacuumed; room service food was cold, congealed and terrible, and not only is the usual high percentage gratuity included automatically which is fine but they have a space for &quot;additional gratuity&quot; on the bill and push for it; the lobby check in/out is chaos and overcrowded, not well managed; this is a no service rather than full service hotel: multiple telephone calls did not produce the items requested from housekeeping; unlike many marriotts there are no coin operated laundry machines on any one of the 39 floors, and they ask you to use the ones offered at the hotel next door (why not just stay there instead?); yes as many reviews mentioned the windows are filthy; the concierge lounge is cramped and offers continental breakfast only (many marriotts have eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, a full breakfast); concierge level hors d'oeuvres and desserts are cheap and unappetizing; in room shampoos are nothing special, very cheap; general impression is this is a mass produced and disorganized conference/downtown shopping hotel, not a full service hotel."
83,2153,"Jun 21 2008 	Loved The View Loved The Room Great Stay	We Stayed in This Hotel for one day. the check in area is always crowded, and you dont have to travel far to find a starbucks! the elevators are really confusin, and ineffective. you are going to need a second job to pay the parking bill! i think last time i checked, it was $55 per day. we got a junior suite, it was great. lots of great amenities. i loved the Good night chocolates, but i expected alot more from service. the view is so amazing!! i loved it, but it was to &quot;alcoholic&quot; for me. Here's a tip, Park across the street for 25$. it wont give you in n out priveleges, but its safe enough to keep it there overnight!"
84,2153,"Jun 20 2008	Value but impersonal	I am hard pressed to write anything bad about this hotel. Good location, very good and modern rooms. If anything, it is too big and impersonal. But my room was excellent and quiet and the staff did all that they needed to do to check me in and check me out. The hotel is on the more expensive side, but then, it is a five staff property. Depending on circumstance, would stay here again."
85,2153,"Jun 8 2008 	Dirty Windows and no vending machines!	I regularly stay t this hotel on business.For the price, you expect to get clean windows! I have complained time and time again and they keep telling me &quot;they are all like that.&quot; These windows have simply not been cleaned out the outside for years! On my latest stay, it appears they have removed ALL the soda/vending machines on every floor. When I called the front desk to find out my options, I was told to use the mini-bar in my room. $5 for a small bottle of water...!!!!!"
86,2153,"May 28 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Marriott in downtown San Francisco and loved everything about the hotel. The hotel lobby is spacious and beautiful and all the staff were exceptional. We had a beautiful panoramic view from our room on the 36th floor. The rooms are large, with very comfortable beds and are nicely decorated with plenty of lighting. It was a busy weekend at the hotel but I could rarely hear any conversation or T.V noise from the rooms next door. My wifes only complaint was that the bathroom toiletries weren't great. The fitness room is large with plenty of equipment. The mini bar was occupied with overpriced alcohol and soft drinks, but a portable refrigerator was provided at no charge. With a rite-aid across the street it was easy to stock up on water and drinks at a much more reasonable price. And of course the location was great...San Fran is a great walking city and the hotel is within walking distance of many great restaurants. Like others have stated parking is very expensive at the hotel. I rented a car and parked at a large parking structure across the street which was slightly cheaper at $30/day. If we weren't driving back and forth to wine country I would have relied on the BART and skipped the car rental."
87,2153,"May 24 2008	Excellent	Stayed for 3 nights. The rate was $199 for a larger corner room when other major downtown hotels were ranging from $260 to $425. The room was spacious, well appointed, very clean, very large desk/table to work at, plasma TV, very comfortable bed and quiet. The only negatives were the coffee maker that makes one cup at a time and doesn't keep it hot and the windows were in dire need of washing-very minor irritants and no reason to even think of not staying here.When I heard the parking was $52 a day I decided to skip a rental car which is very unusual for me. I took BART from the Airport and it stops a block from the hotel at Powell/4th station-cost was $5.35 instead of over $40 for a cab. BART is clean, fast, well run, on schedule, easy to use and makes the CTA in Chicago where I have lived my whole life seem like the armpit it is. San Franciscans do not know how good BART is unless they have taken the CTA. I highly recommend it if you stay at the Marriott.If you do not have a car and want to see Fisherman's Wharf, for $1.50 you can take the F streetcar on Market St. from the hotel. The streetcars are vintage, built in 1948, and were used in other major citiies and have been recently restored. see http://www.streetcar.org/ for info. Very nice nostalgic operation. You can get a transfer for free and use it to ride back in an hour and a half. If you go to Fisherman's Wharf eat at Cioppino's (www.cioppinosf.com) Great Italian/Seafood, large portions and our server was wonderful. It is around the corner from the beginning of the F Market streetcar lineWe ate at Mel's Diner several times. It is across the street from the Marriott and its motif is from the movie American Graffitti. If you liked the movie you will love Mel's. Breakfasts are good and reasonably priced. Service was quick. Lunch and dinner are fine but we did not like the open face turkey.so stay away from it. Don't eat in the hotel with its high prices when this is across the street"
88,2153,"May 22 2008	Great Hotel	My 2 boys (ages 6 &amp; 8 yrs) joined my husband in SF while he was there for business. While this is primarily a &quot;business&quot; hotel, we were able to enjoy the hotel as well. Not s super &quot;family friendly&quot; hotel...but the staff is extrememly helpful, bringing a refrigerator, microwave, &amp; rollaway bed upon request. Could not have asked for better service!The room was a little small for the four of us, but updated, modern, and very nice.The lobby was undergoing major renovation, but we were not affected by noise or dust. Just a little bit of an &quot;eye sore.&quot; The location was great, easy walking distance to Union Square, restaurants, and the cable car.I would stay here again."
89,2153,"May 18 2008 	on The outskirts...	We Stayed at the S.F. Marriott for 3 nights. We arrived at the hotel and my first impression was that it was very modern, with sleek decor, very open and Cold, and a trendy bar downstairs. The front desk girl was nice, but seemed really confused as we were using our marriott points for the 3rd night. ( we were even locked out of our room our 3rd day,so she must have Really been confused. the room itself was roomy and clean, but nothing exceptional. We never went to the Pool/spa area, but the &quot;view bar&quot; at the top was spectacular, if you can find a seat next to the window. A negative to this hotel is if you take the corner, it gets a litte shady, and to end on a positive note, the Bellmen are extremely friendly and helpful. We asked one of a breakfast spot one morning, and He recommened &quot;Wich Craft&quot; and showed us directions. (the sandwiches were fantastic!).By morning 4, I was more than happy to leave and head elsewere. This is a good 1-2 night hotel."
90,2153,"May 17 2008 	Nice upscale Marriott location	I recently stayed at the San Francisco Marriott for a conference. I came away with a positive impression of the property. The rooms were quite nice, definitely better than your standard business travel fare. Everything was clean and spacious. The lobby and convention/conference areas were in great shape and the staff was friendly and helpful. It was priced just about where I would expect for a hotel in downtown San Francisco (not cheap, but it wasn't outrageous either). I would definitely return here if I was visiting for non-business purposes."
91,2153,"May 16 2008 	Great staff great stay	We loved our stay here. The staff was wonderful. We booked on a Marriott Friends and Family discount, so we were not sure what we would get, but we had two nice connected rooms. The hotel was clean, and the staff was wonderful, everyone seemed genuinely happy. Room was nicely enhanced, flat screens, featherbeds, etc. They gave us a fridge at our request, no charge. As per prior posts, the pool seemed to have independant hours that changed at whim, and was not open when it should have been. The View Bar on the 39th floor was awesome. Kids allowed, they serve Shirley Temples, etc. Nice clean venue, fairly quiet gathering place. Seats fill early. The hotel was very convenient, BART and the Cable Cars are at the end of the block. Mel's diner is one block away, and is open 24/7 for all your dining needs. SF Centre Shopping is across the street, Union Square is 3-4 blocks away. Fishermans Wharf is a 20 minute Cable Car ride or a $10 cab ride away. You can reach the Airport easily via a $5.35 Bart ride, which you pick up at the end of the block. We loved the Bay Quackers tour, worth the moolah and the tour guide was very kind and informative. This is a tour bus ride that is also a boat. Great trip, we will stay here again."
92,2153,"May 13 2008 	Very Nice Experience - Terrific Location	Stayed at the Marriott with a friend for four nights in early May. I had booked a fantastic price using my AAA discount. Our room, on the 17th floor, was very nice and had great views of the Yerba Buena area. Everything about our stay was handled incredibly well by the staff, and they even let us check in almost six hours early! The location could not be better - it is only a half-block from the BART/MUNI station entrance. Furthermore, Westfield Center and Union Square are incredibly close by. There is a Hertz rental location inside the hotel, so getting a car is also very simple, and the staff is very helpful with directions. All in all, we had a great experience with no problems whatsoever."
93,2153,"May 13 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	Stayed here for a couple of days. Loved the hotel and many things to see and do within walking distance or a short cab ride away. The staff was great, the room was somewhat small but nice. Didnt care much for the hospitality snacks and bar. The slightest movement and you'll be charged. Which happened to us. But they took the charges off. We walked to the wharf from here but it's a couple of miles so unless you like to walk I wouldnt suggest it. Too many homless people in S.F. and the parking prices are absolutely ridiculous. A major rip off to say the least. The food wasnt bad and the beer was cold. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again for sure. The Marriott beds are the best !"
94,2153,"Apr 28 2008 	Great Stay!	Just spent two nights at the Marriott. I've been to this hotel before for brunch and other things but never actually stayed the night. Our room was perfect. We had a corner room on the 29th floor with an incredible view of the city. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom was large enough. The great thing about the Marriott is the location. We like that it's on 4th Street and walking distance to shopping and a quick trip to just about anywhere in the city. The bar on the top floor was pretty cool. We had a drink up there late Friday night and it was a good atmosphere. Overall a great stay, would highly recommend."
95,2153,"Apr 19 2008 	Not that great	We stayed here for a meeting/convention at the Moscone West Convention Center. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the convention center. It's not too far, but the newly built Intercontinental Hotel is actually closer than the Marriott. The hotel was under construction at the time we were there, which made for terrible traffic inside the lobby area. Construction began right at 7am, so you might hear noises depending on where your room is. And because of the construction, you have to take different elevators to get to your floor. This added to a lot of inconvenience. To all readers, before thinking about staying here, check to see that their construction is completed. I don't think you would get your money worth if the construction was still going on. Otherwise, the room is nice. Very modern and hi tech. Every room has hi-def TV. Bathroom has granite counter. Hotel is situated in a very convenient location. It's close to restaurants, shopping, etc."
96,2153,"Apr 18 2008	Decent accomodation would come back	Located in the centre of the city and sight seeing easy to access, close to congress centre and with congress accomodations within. Rooms clean, elegant set up, air conditioning a bit too cold but warm and cozy bedding. Rooms were clean and cleaned prompty. Breakfast buffet very rich, with most wishes to be accomodated. The only hassle i had, was with a door handle, which never worked and the person, who was supposed to come and repair it never came, it required a few complains, for it to be fixed. Anyway would stay there anytime again."
97,2153,"Apr 15 2008 	Beautiful hotel	We just returned from a 4 day trip to San Francisico. Loved the Marriott and location. A few blocks to Union Square and all of the shopping and attractions. The hotel was extremely clean. Rooms were beautiful. Loved the gym, plenty of equipment. TV's at each treadmill. My only complaint is the parking at this hotel. The rate is $53 per day! We knew this prior to our trip having stayed in SF in the past year. In the future we will fly in and take the bart downtown to our hotel. The Marriott is also a block or so next to the Westfield mall. This is a gorgeous mall with every store you can imagine. Awesome gourmet food court on the lower level. Don't miss this. Also, go to &quot;King of Thai Noodle House&quot; on O'Farrell next to Macy's. Excellent Thai food. Best we have ever had. Head over to North Beach/Little Italy. Great restaurant, &quot;Ideal.&quot; Recommended by locals in that area."

I'll try to be brief and discuss hotel, a few tips and tours.San Francisco Marriott on Fourth Street: Superb location. Just around the corner from the Westfield Mall, and loads of shopping and restaurants. Just a minute to the corner to catch the F train which runs all the way down Market Street and to Fisherman's Wharf. Just another half a block and you can catch a trolley car. The hotel's overall services were very good. Starbucks in the lobby, nice lobby bar, though about half the ground floor lobby was still under construction and walled off. Room was not ready at (early) check in so baggage check was great. Up on the 25th floor with a really nice view, the room was average, but clean and with comfy beds. I prefer room arrangements where the shower/toilet are behind the door and the sink is located outside of that area, which was not the configuration here, but the shower was still nice and the sink was wide and granite. The biggest bug that a lot of travelers complain about applies to the Marriott. Why do upscale hotels offer less in-room amenities than avg. chain hotels? $12.95 for internet access when your local Drury or Holiday In Express provides for free? And perhaps the silliest in this hotel: outrageous charges for snacks that sit on a weird magnetic tray that will charge you if you move the snack and a stocked fridge that will also charge for uses. Give me an empty fridge any day of the week. We often went around the corner and grabbed sodas and snacks from the Walgreen's and brought back to the room - kept the sodas in the ice bucket. Silly though for a hotel of this calibur to treat guests this way.Tom's Walking Muir Woods tour: Fab-U-Lous. Can't say enough about this great guy and great tour. His wife, Lisa, joined us and there was about 7-8 total in the group (including a nice couple from Scotland). Tom was knowledgeable, friendly and funny. It was great to be picked up at the hotel and even better to get to the woods early to beat the crowd and noise. We trekked on the trails for about 3 hours and it was terrific. Wine Country Tours: Took the F Train down to the Ferry Marketplace to catch the tour. Driver Brian and tour guide Jason were very nice. Jason was incredibly knowledgeable and made the trip very nice. While I discovered I'm still not a big fan of wine in general, the area is beautiful and the wine tasting and picnic stop was fun. It would have been nice to see a bit more of the production areas and wine caverns, but that's just me. Trust me, we had some fun people who just really enjoyed tasting the wine.Other stuff, Westfield Mall has a great food court in the lower level - hey don't laugh, it's not your usual food court. Andale's Mexican was yummy. Mel's diner was just on the corner of Fourth and nice for breakfast and not overly expensive - under $10. All-in-all, nice long weekend trip and it didn't hurt that the weather for northern Cal was perfect. Dress in layers and wear comfy shoes. Pack light on the way out so that you can bring home all the new stuff."
99,2153,"Mar 31 2008 	Crowded Rooms Friendly Staff	We spent four nights here for a conferenceit was okay overall though we had some issues, which started right at check-in. When we got up to the room we saw we had been assigned a handicapped room though we didnt request one. It was no big deal we assumedjust some bars around the toilet. After being in the room for a few hours we found the problemthe shower was designed for a wheelchair user ONLY. The showerhead height was designed for someone sitting and the hand held shower head could only be raised to a maximum height of about 4 feet 6 inches. When I called to complain reception offered to move us but by that time we had completely unpacked and there was stuff all around the room. In the end we opted not to move and sucked it up but every time we took a shower got angry about the situation. Have you ever tried to wash your hair with one hand? In addition, the water pressure on the 19th floor was dreadfulit was like being peed on, my husband joked.My experience with conference hotels such as Marriott and Hyatt is that rooms are generally sizable but this wasnt the case with our room. It was just crowded with stuff and there was not a lot of empty space in the room. The closet, for example, had the ironing board and the safe on an overly large pedestal. This stuff took up so much room that there wasnt room to open your suitcase up inside. Also, for a property that caters to business people, we found it strange that there was absolutely no free space on the desk/dresser area. There was the TV, connectivity equipment, hotel info binders and an enormous snack display (in addition to the minibar) that made your room look like a convenience store. Of course, the candy was out in the open to tempt you (see the review below about the property not losing a single opportunity to make money off guests) but it was also ugly and in the way and because of the sensors you couldnt move it. In the end I threw my coat over it so I didnt have to see itit was right in your eye line when you were sitting on the bed. For anyone traveling with kids I can see the snacks causing problems.There were some good points to the room though. I found the bed extremely comfortable. If you like a softer, pillowy mattress youll be happy here. There was a featherbed on the mattress and lots of pillows and the sheets felt nice and silky. The LG flat screen got a great picture on the digital channels and the hotel offered HBO. And the windows actually opened so you could get fresh air.We got passes to the breakfast buffet for our trouble with the shower and I have to say it was quite good. Bottomless Illy coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice, made to order omelets and waffles, all the typical breakfast dishes, some nicer stuff like smoked salmon and a huge assortment of fresh fruit. If you were paying it was pricey though, at $22 a person. A la carte dishes were also available. The onsite Starbucks and Hertz rental desk were convenient. Also, the pool looked pretty nice; a good size for an indoor hotel pool and it had a nice area for lounging. The location is in walking distance to many SF tourist attractions, shopping and the convention center.Finally, excepting our trouble at check-in, I was really impressed with how friendly all the staff were. Maybe its a west coast thing and Im used to east coast grumpiness but everybody from the servers in the restaurant, to the Starbucks employees to housekeepers and even maintenance staff, who asked if I needed help when I seemed lost, were really nice.With a rate of $139 a night I was okay with this place, it wasnt great but there were some nice aspects also. Know that if you have to come here for a conference there are other choices in the immediate area. The Hotel Palomar is right across the street, for example."
100,2153,"Mar 29 2008 	great location	Stayed here for a convention at a reduced rate. Room had a high quality 42 inch HD TV and was very comfortable. Excellent location close to Moscone convention center, restaurants, cable car, and shopping. I really enjoyed Yerba Buena Garden right next to it and the bar with a terrific view on the 39th floor. My only complaint is that there are three sets of elevators going to different floors which was confusing for the first day or two. Guests have to transfer elevators to get from certain floors to other floors."
101,2153,"Mar 23 2008 	This hotel REALLY wants your money!	I stayed here for 3 nights while attending a huge conference. The rooms were extremely comfortable and tasteful, and the bathrooms so modern, clean and big...nice towels, but their shampoo smells weird. They were doing a lot of construction in the hotel, so that made for difficult elevator use--lots of detours. Not to mention the intolerable disruption to so many of our conference presentations!My big gripe with this hotel is that it's already VERY expensive and I guess they figure only filthy rich people stay here because they try to get a few more dollars out of you at every turn. Wireless is very expensive and the signal terribly weak. To change your clothes in the locker room at the pool/health spa is 5 bucks. And most offensive of all, if you even TOUCH anything on the minibar (which includes such insults as a $4 Snickers) a SENSOR underneath it automatically charges you for it!!! So when you check out, pay attention to your final total, because you're likely to have paid out the nose for stale candy bars that you didn't even unwrap.A really great Asian fusion restaurant right around the corner is called Straits. Not too expensive and very classy. There's also a nice cheap and good Thai place a couple of blocks away."
102,2153,"Mar 22 2008 	Pleasant Stay at San Francisco Marriott	March 2008. I took the Amtrak Capital Corridor Train from the Sacramento Valley into the Emeryville Amtrak train station. From there an Amtrak connection bus into San Francisco. The bus stopped on Market between 4th and 5th so it was very convenient to the San Francisco Marriott, just off of Market on 4th. strret I was in town for three stay to attend a AAFA planning session. The hotel lobby was very busy, since this property also serves as convention hotel to the nearby San Francisco convention center. There were many physicians attending some type of medical convention. If you want a more quite setting, head up the hill toward properties near Union Square (Grand Hyatt, Hilton, or budget oriented Warwick Regis). My check in was smooth and I received a quiet corner room. I did not hear street noise other than a safety vehicle siren now and then.I had a great group rate of $152.00 per night. Which is a good price for San Francisco property. My room was good size with plenty of natural light and room lights. I asked for refrigerator and one was brought up fairly quick. The king bed was not the most comfortable Marriott bed but it was okay. There is small desk area and a chair. The TV had many local channels and cable channels. No golf channel.The bathroom was standard size. Water pressure was good and hot water was good too. My room was cleaned well each day.I ate at the 2nd floor inhouse restaurant for buffet Sunday breakfast. my breakfast was good, not great but a bit pricey.I recommend for more economical eating nearby...the basement of the San Francisco Shopping Center.(Where Nordstrom and Bloomingdales is located)..which has a gourmet grocery store...with many custom sections...kind of like the Whole Foods market at the basement of the Time Warner building on Columbus Square in Manhattan.Also there are many Asian fast food restaurants that are better than more food court restaurants or chains like Panda Express.At this location there was a yummy Korean BBQ and good Thai fast food places with many Asian Americans and locals eatings there as well. Good value and yummy.At the nearby Sony Meteron at Yerba Buena Gardens there is food court with several choices including the Buckhorn which has good beef and salads. There is also a good small bakerynearby the food court as well.On Market street nearby there are two Walgreen Drugstores, one West of 4th and the other East of 4th. You can get snacks, beverages, personal items and sundries at the Walgreen stores.Everyone I came into contact at the S.F. Marriott were very helpful and friendly. The front desk person was excellent and both cleaning folks were very friendly. Both left thank you notes for my daily cleaning tips.Through my experience in traveling...it is not particular chains and or brands that have greaet service (unless you go high end...Four Seasons...Mandarin Oriental...). It is more function of the General Manager of that particular property who sets the tone on how the hospitality workers behave towards clients. Hostpitality workers do not often get the best compensations pacakges, some do not get health benefits), so the savvy and skill of good people oriented Hotel GM can make all the difference to the guests who come to visit that property.I'd stay at the San Francisco Marriott again for a good rate. The only negative is that is a busy place and if you want less hectic lobby, then this might not be the property for you.I am scheduled back in San Francisco in June for HRPS Leadership Development &amp; Succession Planning workshop. I am going to stay at the JW Marriott where the HRPS event is being held and where I can both a good group rate of $152 and HRPS rate as well. Alternative property I would consider would be the Grand Hyatt on Union Square.On my trip back home, I accidently got on the wrong train at Emeryville Station and when quickly trying to get off of train headed towards Bakersfield, I left one of my Rimowa wheeled luggage aboard. I notified an Amtrak representative on my correct train who phoned the other train to search for my luggage left on board. Several days later my luggage was delivered to my hometown train station with everything intact.Kudos to Amtrak!!!I give high recommendations to the San Francisco Marriott."
103,2153,"Mar 21 2008 	~Loved The View Lounge	We stayed at the San Francisco Marriott for five nights in March. The location is excellent just beside Union Square ,transport links and great shopping... The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel has good facilities as in pool, gym two lounges and the in house Starbucks came in handy. The View Lounge is great to sit in at sundown and enjoy a cocktail of your choice. On the other hand it is a big hotel with a lot of conventions and business guests so it would not be to everyones taste."
104,2153,"Mar 10 2008 	good and bad	Standard convention center hotel.When we booked hotel, we asked for and were promised room with city view. When we arrived, guy at front desk was being rude and said none were available. I had a feeling he was just being a lazy a-hole, so we went up to our room with the intent of talking to manager, but not in front of that guy. The room we initially received was on a low floor and had a view of a back alley. When I called down and spoke with the manager, she said plenty of view rooms were available and immediately moved us into a corner view room near the top floor. She also gave us 4 drink tickets for the bar on the top floor. Our new room had a an excellent view of the city and bay. The room was very clean and had contemporary decor.The bar at the top of the hotel has an awesome view. Probably the best of any hotel lounge in the city.Despite the rude an unprofessional front desk staff, we would most likely return to this hotel. Can't remember his name, but one of the concierges provided excellent advice and was extremely helpful during our entire stay. One of the best pieces of advice he gave was to park in the structure behind the hotel at a fraction of the cost of the ridiculously overpriced hotel parking."
105,2153,"Mar 1 2008 	9 women 2 rooms and 1 great stay!	The women in my extended family took this year's annual Christmas shopping trip and made it a 3 day event.Parking was a bit excessive ($50/nite) but safe valet in the city is worth it for me. And do take note of other members notes on the Taxi Scandal, it got a little rediculous mostly because we needed 2 cabs to go everywhere. Ok onto the Hotel itself:Service was wonderful! we had a bellman named alfonso he took care of us for our entire stay. I have a thoery in big cities that you should always ask the bellman before you ask the concierge, you generally get better results. He moved our 2 tons of luggage in the hotel, then to move rooms, and unloaded us, then proceeded to give us great reccomendations. Then during a false fire alarm he brought out bottles of water while we waited for the 'all clear'The check in was quick and painless. They got our party 2 rooms that were adjacent which was helpful, the rooms were spacious for a hotel. (be sure to check the mini-bar; we had missing items at c/i that we would have been charged for had we not mentioned it to the f/d). The Marriott Bedding was wonderful as always! The lobbys were beautiful and spacious. The Garden Terrace bar was decent but not spectacular, Bin 55 was very good. The View bar is a CANT MISS. Absolutley beautiful views. Overall my only complaint was the the parking fee, and the taxi line. Dont let those stop you though, they didnt detract from the experience."
106,2153,"Feb 15 2008 	Average Marriot	The Marriot is at good central location downtown, parking is very expensive and inconvenient. rooms are rather small and the bathroom is very average."
107,2153,"Jan 31 2008 	Nice hotel a little trouble with our reservation	We spent a short weekend at the San Francisco Marriott on our trip to the Emerald Bowl football game and thought it was very nice. It is under renovation but we didn't see or hear any construction. The lobby is large and spacious, the hallways are quiet, the carpet is new and the rooms were lovely. We stayed on the 14th floor and didn't have much of a view, but the beds were very comfortable (made me want to come home and get a new one), the bedding is fabulous and the flat screen LCD television was in high defintion. We ordered breakfast to our room the last morning and it arrived hot, fresh and on time.The only problem we had was with regard to our reservation. The hotel's options of one king or 2 doubles really didn't work for us, so we reserved a king with a rollaway. This was done online and part of the selection and reservation process, not something we typed in as a comment. When we arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night after a very long, difficult drive we were less than pleased to learn that all the rollaways were gone. If the rollaways are in fact first come, first serve as the desk clerk indicated, they should absolutely not be a part of the online reservation system. We were counting on that rollaway and really needed it. They offered us a breakfast voucher in exchange after one of the people traveling with us pressed for compensation, which was nice but still did not make our sleeping arrangements pleasant. Beware that if you reserve a rollaway you are not guaranteed to get it."
108,2153,"Jan 29 2008	Reliable choice	This hotel is in a nice location and the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was accomodating and check-in was a pleasant experience, even at midnight. The only complaint that I have is that the hotel is currently undergoing construction (which they did warn me about) and so getting from lobby level to your floor is somewhat of a challenge. We had to take an elevator to floor 4, walk around the corner, and take another elevator on up to higher floors. The same goes for going back down, and the wait for the elevator is sometimes long as everyone is trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Other than that, the experience was fine. Nothing special. Oh and also, charging for internet access in the room (not even wireless) is a bit silly, especially for a business-friendly hotel."
109,2153,"Jan 27 2008 	Ridiculous Valet/Taxi scam	Stayed at the Marriott SF for 2 nights and the hotel itself is not bad, nicely updated rooms, good beds and nice plasma TV's in each room, Starbucks in the lobby etc.Marriott management should be aware that they are doing an incredible disservice to their guests by allowing their valets to operate the racket that they have going on with the Taxis. As another reviewer pointed out (toasty24 review dated 10/27/07) the valets are running a common bribery racket when it comes to the Taxis here (they require the taxis to pay for airport and other fares). It took me about 2 minutes in the taxi line to catch onto this, but it wasn't just limited to so called &quot;airport&quot; fares. If you tip the valets you'll get a taxi right away under the guise of a &quot;reservation&quot; if not you'll stand in line, of course at that point they'll offer you a house car which I'm sure they're also getting kickbacks from. The taxi line takes quite a bit of time and you'll see several empty taxis drive through the valet area that refuse to pay the valets off so the valets will tell you those taxis are off duty and aren't taking any fares. The evening I was in line it was raining and I was wise to their scam so when an empty taxi drove by I said to the valet, &quot;What's wrong, they wouldn't pay?&quot; I then heard one of the valet's coworkers tell him that if he went on break he'd make sure we were still standing there when he got back, and we were at the very front of the line. We eventually got a taxi and we confirmed with our driver that he did indeed pay the valet $5 for the fare, he said airport fares go for 10-15. Marriott management should be aware that these employees are doing a horrible disservice to thier guests by only having the &quot;paying&quot; taxis available to their guests.Oh, and don't rent a car either, valet parking is $50 a night, which is outrageous no matter what city you're in."
110,2153,"Jan 17 2008 	Typical Convention Center Hotel	When you think of a convention center hotel, this is probably what you have in mind. However, if you're headed to a convention - especially one at the Moscone Center, this is fine place to stay.The rooms are small but clean. They have been updated recently and have comfortable beds with good bedding. The curtains are especially good at blocking the light if you like a dark room. There's a flat panel television with a good selection of digital channels. The hotel had internet available via ethernet; however, I was able to pick up a free wifi signal from outside the hotel. That was probably just luck and I didn't see a hotel wifi.The bathroom was also small, but had good, soft towels. The water pressure was fine.I checked in late and left early, so I didn't see much of the staff. However, the gentleman who checked me in was quite helpful. It was late and I was looking for a decent meal outside of the hotel. He gave me a great choice.If you're looking to have a drink in the hotel, there's a bar on the top floor with amazing views of the city.All in all, this isn't some amazing must see destination - especially for a city with so many historic hotels. However, if you need a place to spend the night, check your e-mail and then get to a convention, this will do just fine. (Also, don't take this to be condemning the hotel with faint praise. Rather, it's just a good way to say the convention center hotel is what it is.)"
111,2153,"Jan 13 2008 	Good hotel but bring earplugs	We stayed here for one night, a Saturday. The hotel was full with convention-goers but seemed to be run efficiently. Check-in was easy, the staff was great and the concierge was able to get us a great last minute dinner reservation.The location can't be beat - right by the Powell Street BART station and lots of shopping (Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, etc.). I'd recommend taking the BART into the city and leaving your car at the station. Otherwise, parking is about $50/day at the Marriott.The room was very nice, clean and the bathroom is large for San Francisco standards. The main problem with our room was that the walls were so thin that we could hear people talking in the room next door. And in the morning a child was blowing a whistle or something, and we REALLY heard that.Also, the breakfast is very expensive, so go across the street to the Mel's or Denny's.We got a great deal on Priceline - half price. So all in all, we were very satisfied with our stay."
112,2153,"Jan 8 2008 	Nice Marriott	I stayed here the weekend before Christmas for two nights for a conference. The conference was at the hotel. The lobby was under construction, so the front desk was temporarily moved to the second floor. There seemed to be some confusion with traffic and where to go. Starbucks was in the lobby. My room was on the 16th floor facing Bloomingdales. The rooms were nice, just about right for a Marriott. The location was perfect for within walking distance to Union Square, Macy's, and great restaurants. I would stay here again."
113,2153,"Jan 7 2008 	Affordable luxury	It was a pleasure staying here. The lobby is beautiful and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I stayed in the high rise section in a double and the room was huge! The beds were also large and comfy and the pillows were divine - you'll never want to wake up!The indoor pool is cold but the jacuzzi is so relaxing you'll forget to dip back in the pool.The View Lounge is spectacular. A view of San Francisco in this lounge will take your breath away. A little pricey for small plates so if you want to splurge go right ahead, it's worth it with the view you're right next to.The hotel is just a walk to Union Square and Westfield's San Francisco's Centre. Public transportation such as the BART and cable car is also a short walk away! Everything you want to visit is in walking distance.I recommend going back to this hotel if I'm ever in San Francisco and actually have been back in November =) It's worth staying in such affordable luxury!"
114,2153,"Jan 3 2008 	Not The Marriott Standard	As far as I can tell, San Francisco is a very expensive place to visit. I understand this, and will always pay a little more for Marriott Hotels, as this is one of my favorites. About the San Francisco Marriott, I booked two rooms as we were meeting some friends to see the Cirque show. Booking and all was easy, and efficient on Marriotts website, and the cost per room (around 200.00 per night) was about what I expected.The hotel location is fantastic! The heart of the city and a brief walk from the Bart Station. The lobby is undergoing renovation, which I expected as well, so no points deducted for construction issues. Check in was fantastic, fast, and efficient. So where did Marriott let me down? The room.Our rooms (1118 and 1119) were dusty, dirty and not nearly up to the Marriott standard. The first thing I noticed was a massive layer of dust on the snack tray and all over the old candy bars, and stuff. The bathroom floor had some hair on it, as well as wet spots, and general dirtiness. Outside my door was an air cleaning machine, that simply sat there our entire stay. (I finally picked it up, and put it inside our room. The bedding was clean as far as I can tell, and of course, as comfortable as a cloud.I was just really taken aback by the overall cleanliness of the rooms. (Both had the same issues)As for eating breakfast in the lobby area........skip it! At about 25 bucks a person for the brunch, I have eaten better food at a gas station. The staff in the restraunt was attentive, polite, and on the spot with serving, which was a plus. I did not have a car this trip, but was aghast at the overnight parking at 50.00 dollars per night! Overall, this hotel needs some housekeeping renovation to go along with what they are doing in the lobby. There is no reason to sell dirty rooms to Marriott customers at all. Whewn I mentioned this to an employee, they indicated &quot;we are undergoing renovations&quot;....not an excuse. I am sorry to say I will not return to the Marriott San Francisco on my next trip this week. Any suggestions?"
115,2153,"Dec 27 2007 	great location parking is expensive and painful	The hotel location is great, close to all the shoppings, and easy to get to where ever you want to visit. The room is clean, the bed is comfortable, the bar at the top has great views, and the lobby is nice too. The parking is expensive, and valet parking only. that could be an issue if you go in and out all the time, sometimes we have to wait for a while for our car if they were very busy.When we got there, my bf run to use restroom, so I unloaded all our luggages from our car. Amazingly, no bellman came to me to offer service. I ended up pulling all our luggages into lobby myself! But other than that, we enjoyed our stay very much."
116,2153,"Dec 24 2007 	Perfect for a Holiday Spirit boost	This was the first time I used Priceline. I had looked at Hotwire, and 4 stars were priced at $139-$159, then I looked at regular prices for the Travelodge on Lombard (least expensive hotel I would consider in SF) and got a quote of $86, so I Pricelined for $89 a night, and the SF Marriott said OK. Regular rate on Marriott.com for the room I got was $286 for the nights I booked so I was happy with the rate.The lobby was in the process of being moved and I found the layout of the hotel a little confusing with three elevator banks, long hallways the had multiple paths to rooms, and exits on 4th street rather than Market or Mission which would seem more logical. Also a little bothersome that they were running blowers to dry the carpets each evening on my floor.I was given a corner room with ten windows overlooking Market and up Grant to the Chinatown Gate. Plenty of light for a very cloudy week. The heating could have been better, but the room was is great condition. As more days passed the maid service became less well done, but it was acceptable. The lobby staff was great.As far as the location and the tourist sites, well it is a little off the normal tourist path, but I took the F streetcar from 4th down Market to the Ferry building and then up to Fisherman's Wharf and then the Cable Car back to Powell and Market which was only a block away from the hotel. The buses to other sites were right there so as long as you use public transit there were no difficulties staying here. I bought my bus pass at the Tourist Center and Powell and Market; $24 for 7 days - a bargain. The CityPass is also a great deal if you like art at $54.I used BART from SFO to the hotel for $5.15 each way. The Powell stop exits on the corner of the hotel.Cheap eats nearby in the basement food court of Bloomingdale's and at a lot of Union Square places. The crowds at Union Square and the cool temps were just what I needed to get into a Silver Bells holiday mood. A great stay, at a great price."
117,2153,Dec 10 2007 	Great Trip	We just got back from a weekend trip to the San Francisco Marriott. We love San Francisco at Christmas and the Marriott was a great place to stay over the weekend.We did a lot of shopping and the proximity to Union Square and all the surrounding shops was excellent. They were doing some work on the lobby area and it was a little confusing getting around but there was always someone nearby to lead us on our way. The room wasn't very large but there was plenty of space for my wife and I to not feel cramped. The flat screen lcd tv was a plus and it's location in the corner of the room near the window opened up the space in the middle of the room. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. We booked the hotel through a $94 bid on priceline and were very happy with what we got for such a great price. We had a king size bed on the 20th floor with a great view. The parking was pretty expensive ($50/night) so I'd look into parking at a nearby parking lot and saving some money there.
118,2153,"Nov 28 2007 	Beautiful Hotel	Stayed here for a week on a business trip and the rooms are excellent. Very comfortable bed! The room service/food isn't anything to rave about but the hotel is in the center of the city so you can grab a bite to eat from any of the fabulous restaurants in the area. It's a great place to stay in the heart of shopping, attractions, and great food!Feel free to ask me questions if you'd like more info."
119,2153,"Nov 22 2007 	Not So Great stay	Stayed at the downtown Marriott. This place has a great location and central for everything you may need. We stayed on the 4th floor (4019) where our window overlooked an alley and service entrance. Very early in the morning (both days) we had a very large sewer truck parked under our window with workers making a great deal of noise. There was also a lot of street noise that penatrated the closed windows. There is also a ton of remodeling and contruction in the hotel and the location has the ambience of total disarray. The staff has the attitude to match when I asked which of the three different elevator to use. There are plenty of great hotels nearby and I would avoid this property until they get the contruction done and realize that they are in competition with some great hotels nearby. Oh, I almost forgot, it cost $50/day to park at the hotel (which I did) and to top it off my car was damaged by the valet. As a loyal Marriott customer, avoid this place if you can."
120,2153,"Nov 17 2007 	Great location excellent stay	This is right in the shopping district / Union Square! We took the subway from SFO airport and I was pleased that it was only a few blocks from the station to the hotel. The plasma TV was great, the beds comfy. My daughter enjoyed the indoor pool and we went everyday. It's a short distance to the end of the cable car ride so that was perfect. The hotel was busy as it was 4th of July weekend, but we had a great time there. We didn't have much interaction with the staff, but everything was good when we did."
121,2153,"Nov 15 2007 	Super	Spent two nights at the SF Marriott and had an excellent stay. I was attending a conference at the hotel. The location is very convenient, from the restaurants, to the high end shopping district, to the nearby BART station. The staff was very friendly. I requested a high floor &amp; got a room with a spectacular view of the city. They are currently renovating the bottom floor but it's hard to tell because they've modified operations to work around the temporary lack of space. Nothing bad to say about my stay here."

There should complimentary hallway bicycles given the distance they expect you to walk to get to some rooms.The end:Won't stay there again.
123,2153,"Oct 27 2007 	Shameful shady bribery racket going on despite wonderful rooms	Despite a dreamy, marshmallow bed and room that meets all standards (you get what you pay for, this property aint' cheap!), I was truly disappointed with the shady operation that is blatantly going on with the employees that work there, and i want to bring this to your attention. Outside the hotel there is a taxi line for the airport. The valets will let you bypass the line and immediately you a taxi if you slip him $5 or $10. If you don't give him anything, he'll tell you to wait in line (which takes a long time). If this doesn't seem so bad yet, wait --- the TAXI DRIVER then has to surreptiously slip him $10 for the privilege of getting the long airport ride! These valets are raking in a cool $15-$20 per taxi customer, and given the high activity level of this Marriott, these guys are raking in $$$ per hour at while taking advantage of the customers and taxi drivers, all off the books.My colleague and I carefully watched this all unfold while we were outside: Valet in top hat greeting a customer, see him get a bill, and the valet &quot;pretends&quot; that this tipping customer has a &quot;reservation.&quot; A taxi will pull up, and the valet will say &quot;what's your name again?&quot; in front of all the poor people waiting in line, and then lead the customer into the taxi. The Valet leans into the Taxi driver's window to &quot;give directions&quot; and slyly gets his take. When we got in the taxi, the driver admitted that he paid the valet. We asked him why, and he said he had no choice. &quot;if I don't pay, they'll get the next taxi to pay up. We need the money and the long ride to the airport is important to our salary. The cops know about this bribery racket but haven't done anything about it.&quot; He also added that sometimes the price is $15 to get an airport ride.Now you may shrug at all this, but what does this have to do with your stay? Not much, maybe. But it says a lot about how this Marriott treats customers after they exit the property, after paying $350+ a night to stay there. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
124,2153,"Oct 26 2007 	Careful of the rate!	Stayed here in late October. Rooms were pretty nice, common areas not bad either. Room was booked for a conference rate of $199 plus tax ($48). At check out the rate charged was $349 plus tax! Desk clerk was very helpful attempting to resolve, but ultimately had to contact the manager on duty with the statement &quot;please come down to the front desk, we have another one&quot;. The manager attempted to convince us the rate was correct even though another couple we traveled with during the exact dates had the correct amount charged to their bill. He had difficulty getting his story straight regarding the timing of the reservation (he had nothing to say after we demonstrated that our reservation was made 3 days earlier than our traveling companions, after he had stated the other couple had received a better rate for an earlier reservation). Ultimately he refused to honor the rate and became exceeding rude until we decided to leave. Plenty of nice hotels in S.F. We'll stay somewhere else the next time we're in town!"
125,2153,"Oct 16 2007 	Brilliant Hotel!	Brilliant hotel in a brilliant location.We booked a double double room and it was very big with a large bathroom (by hotel standards), stylish decor and massive flatscreen TV.Beds were super-comfy and the we had a great view of downtown SF from our 16th floor room.The 39th floor view bar was also great with view over the whole city.When we were there the hotel was rennovating the ground floor but this made no difference to us (there was no noise or mess) and ALL the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly especially the concierge, doorman and receptionists.Great location just off Market St, a stones's throw from the major stores and very near to the Powell Street Cable Car terminus (just get there early!!)."
126,2153,Oct 13 2007 	Great location	We got a great room with a partial view of the bay bridge. This hotel is central to everything. Chinatown and Union Square are pretty close by. There were lots of restaurants nearby. Bring your nice and comfy shoes. I would give it a 5 if we got a great deal on the rates. We came in at conference season so most of the hotels were fully booked. I will definitely recommend if you get a good rate. Room: Bed and pillows were decent as expected from a Marriot. Bathroom was modern and clean. 35 &quot; plasma TV screen.
127,2153,"Oct 11 2007 	Excellent View	We booked this late, but were given a wonderful room with a view to die for. It was a very nice hotel. St. Patrick's Catholic Church SAN FRANCISCO'S #4 HISTORIC LANDMARKFOUNDED IN 1851 very close. The 2nd Sunday of every month they have a authentic Filipino breakfast in the basement of the church for $5.00--we thought it was very fun to get to attend. We parked in the public parking garage (underground) and came up right next to the church....very close to the hotel."
128,2153,"Oct 9 2007 	Great San Francisco Location	This is centrally located for Union Square; for the shopping, cable cars and the city. The rooms were very comfortable, there was a great flat screen TV. There is internet access. There is a newly refurbished gym and also a pool. The concierge was very informative. Its is a very busy hotel and there is the usual expensive car parking charge for being in this city. This hotel has it for the location. There is a upper level bar and you can enjoy a drink with views of the city from high!"
129,2153,"Oct 2 2007 	Great hotel and excellent location!	We stayed at the San Francisco Marriott between 25 Aug and 28 Aug.The lobby is currently being renovated and reception has been relocated to the second floor however there are lots of staff in the main lobby to tell you where to go. I had asked for a room on a high floor, with a view. I didn't exactly get that - ended up on the 14th floor with no view! However the room was huge, very clean, great bed and pillows and big flat screen TV so no complaints there.We ate in the hotel restaurant once for dinner and again for breakfast. On both occasions the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. Thought both meals were excellent value for money. We went up to The View bar, which on the hotel's website looks fantastic. I was quite disppointed, its a lot smaller than it looks and there are very few seats with a view. When we got there it was packed and we ended up with seats that had no view at all!Having never been to San Francisco before I was a little concerned about the location of the hotel, whether it would be a long way from places we wanted to visit etc. I shouldn't have worried - within minutes you can walk to Union Square and all the public transport options are so close. We hired our car from the Hertz desk that is in the hotel and again the guy who handled our reservation couldn't do enough for us.Overall we had a great stay in the San Francisco Marriott, thought it was excellent value for money in a terrific location."
130,2153,"Sep 27 2007 	Loved the Marriott	We stayed here from Sept 2nd -9th and had a wonderful week. Check-in was quick and effortless. We had added the last night onto our original reservation and although this constituted two separate reservations, we had no problems - just checked in and out twice - but we were able to keep our same room. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Comfy king sized bed, lots of pillows, large modern washroom with lots of towels, and each day everything was sparkling clean. Large closet and lots of drawer space. We were also happy that there was an in-room safe - I believe the hotel website says that safes are at the front desk. Staff were friendly and very knowledgeable and quite happy to help in any way. Lots of large and speedy elevators. Beautiful lobby. Market Street is around the corner with easy access to the F-Line street-cars. Walgreens is also around the corner on Market. Mel's Diner serves great American food and their milkshakes are to die for. Although a busy place, service is quick. The Metreon has an up-scale food court. Both are virtually outside the front door of the Marriott. Union Square is an easy walk. It was great having a Hertz outlet right in the hotel - we had rented a car for our second week and the convenience of having Hertz right there made the car rental very stress-free. We would certainly return to the Marriott again."
131,2153,"Sep 13 2007 	Great Hotel	We booked this hotel on Priceline for $105 a night which was an extremely excellent deal. We stayed on August 30 and September 1st. The hotel was clean, our room with a king size bed was spacious and had a great view from two sides of the room. The staff was organized and ready to please from the beginning. We asked if we could get a refrigerator for our room and they immediately delivered one free of charge. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat and would stay there again. I recommend the bar on the top floor of the hotel as well - it has a breathtaking view of the entire city being that this is one of the tallest builgings. It also has a nice laid back atmosphere and they make a great pomengranate martini."
132,2153,"Sep 12 2007 	Good location	Here is my review after staying three nights at the marriott, in August.( + / positives)* Excellent central location, on Market Street. From there, you can catch the cable car (beware of queues particularly at the terminus), buses and also the convenient streetcar going to the Ferry Building and various wharfs. Also very close to Union Square, and main department stores. A short walk from China Town. Many restaurants and diners around* Hotel is easily accessible using the BART train from SFO. Cost is only about $6, and will take 30 minutes. Station on Market Street only 3 min walk to the hotel* Good modern and clean room, with large LCD TV screen, excellent bed* Good breakfast buffet, but slighly expensive. Lots of choice* Indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi: Not fantastic but adequate and free. Pool is quite large, with lots of loungers and towels* Lots of lifts so no queues( - / negatives)* Mini bar/fridge cannot be used for storing own food or drinks. One of those models automatically charging when something is removed* Some refurbishing work is currently done at the hotel. Reception area has been moved to the first floor, and is quite small with long queues. Also, can get noisy during the day with the noise of sledge hammers and the likes. However, stops late afternoons not to inconvenience guests* Air conditioning can be noisy* Windows don't appear to be cleaned often: it was even difficult to tell the weather!* No robes, would be useful with the swimming pool* Quite old fashion/70's style hotel. Big and impersonal"
133,2153,"Sep 10 2007 	Wonderful Rooms But Expensive Add-On Charges	We stayed at the SF Marriott downtown in order to attend a convention nearby. We booked the room via priceline for $150 a night (about $175 with taxes and charges). We had a room on the 15th floor with a view of the surrounding downtown buildings. Overall, the room was very nice - it was large, clean and seemed newly remodled. The hotel overall was exceptionally large and laid out in an odd fashion (check-in is on a different floor than where you pull your car in etc). The main concern about the hotel were the add-on charges. Parking was $40. Items in the rooms (snacks etc) were also very expensive. The hotel also provides a number of services that it seemed were required (cab flagging service, luggage hold, bellman service and such) but that also require tipping. I was surprised at how much additional money was spent on tipping and parking for our one-night stay. Overall, it added about $75 to our nightly bill. The location is in the heart of downtown and walking distance to Union Square. It is a bit of a walk to the Emarcadero and there are closer hotels to that area if you seek it out. The rooms were quiet but given the sheer size of the hotel it was a pretty noisy place in the common areas. I'm not sure that I would stay here again even though the rooms were nice just because there are equal hotels that are cheaper with a better location in the city."
134,2153,"Sep 4 2007 	San Francisco Marriot- a great place to stay	Spent the Labor Day weekend at the Marriot. We had in tow two small children and found this hotel to be in the perfect location. It is one block from the Yerba Buena complex which has a children's museum, a playground and a carousel. it is one block from excellent shopping, from the F train old fashioned trolleys and the BART. The staff is super friendly, the buffet breakfasts were delicious and very fresh and the room was large and clean with very cofortable beds. We will stay here again when we are in town. We booked on expedia and everything went smoothy which is important when you are travelling with children. The only criticism is that the tile decking around the swimming pool was very slippery and so one had to be extra careful not to fall. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and look forward to a return visit."
135,2153,"Aug 30 2007 	Good Marriott Under Construction	The hotel was very nice and was located in a great place. It was within short walking distance to the bart and to the street cars. Union square is a couple of blocks away. Many restaraunts are close by, even a sports bar on the corner of the hotel (I can't remember the name of it.) The hotel was under construction. The normal front lobby was being renovated and all check ins were upstairs. The beds were awesome and I wanted to take one home. My beefs with the room are that it did not have a microwave or a fridge (you could get one from the front desk I believe.) Another beef is that the room has this &quot;snack thing&quot; that if you removed one of the snacks it would charge you.... $4 for a little chocolate bar! HA There's a Walgreens down the street for crying out loud! I don't understand how they can charge that for a candy bar. Becareful not to knock over the bottles of water on the &quot;snack thing&quot; because you'll get charged! There is a mini bar under the TV which is awful in price as well. The TV was nice and the view from the room was great. They were playing music in the park across the street and it was nice to listen to in the room. The church next to the hotel rang bells every once in a while. The staff were very friendly and assisted us with ease. We didn't get a chance to eat the hotel or go to the View floor or go to the pool....we were too busy seeing San Fran!"
136,2153,Aug 29 2007 	Parking Charge!!	Make sure you get an excellent room rate as you will pay through the nose for parking. I was charged $49.02 for one night.
137,2153,"Aug 26 2007 	San Francisco Marriott - great hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights in February 2007 over a long weekend. Our room was large and clean; and we had a nice view.We had access to the concierge lounge, which was wonderful. They had pop, bottled water, coffee, tea, and snacks out 24-hours a day. There was a computer with free Internet access and printing available. There had a nice buffet breakfast, hot snacks and desserts out in the evening in the concierge lounge.We took the subway/train from the airport to the hotel. The station was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is also about a 5 minute walk to the street-car turn-a-round stop. There are quite a few malls and shopping areas around the hotel and it is about a 10 minute walk to Chinatown from the hotel.There are other Marriott hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, which I would suggest staying at if you have small children or don't enjoy walking around a lot, because that is where most of the tourist action is at. The San Francisco Marriott is probably more suited for business people or shoppers. However, we don't mind walking around to get where we are going, so it was a great location for us."
138,2153,"Aug 26 2007 	Good Location well maintained	This hotel was in a great location within walking distance of most of the attractions (or a short bus journey if tired). The hotel has a great bar at the top with fantastic views over the city.The only gripe is that (like many hotels on our trip) they were unable to confirm a room with two queen beds and we were given a sinlge King (for our family of four) on arrival. Fortunately they upgraded us to a King Suite when we complained so, although the kids were on camp beds, at least there was space to move.The breakfast buffet was very good and whilst not cheap for adults (c$20), was very good value for the children (c.$7.00)"
139,2153,"Aug 16 2007	Good Location and okay hotel	Good location on Market Street so you have convenient access to Fisherman's Wharf and shopping. But it's a big hotel so don't expect personalized service. That said, everything works very efficiently and we had no complaints as such."
140,2153,"Aug 12 2007 	An Uneventful Stay	I stayed in room 1020 at the Marriott for 5 nights on a recent business trip. There were no big problems, but nothing amazingly good either. The room was relatively clean, there were no bugs, no noise from other rooms, no HVAC problems, and no billing problems. There is a coffee maker in the room, along with an iron, a hair dryer, and a safe. The location is good for tourists who don't want to stay near Fisherman's Wharf, and it's 2 blocks from Moscone. There are restaurants everywhere. If someone told me that my next business trip would take me back to the Marriott, I'd be okay with it.However, the Marriott isn't one of those places where you wonder how everything is so perfect. The CD player on the clock radio didn't work and my call to get it fixed didn't help. The bathroom wasn't spotless, though by the second day, the unidentified stray hairs were gone. The minibar was empty. The plumbing growls and groans when the showers are in use, and it's something to hear at about 8AM. The lobby was always crowded with a mix of vacationers and people attending a convention. Getting a taxi was never quick.The staff was universally friendly, but in that distant and corporate way that is far from memorable. I don't remember if a man or woman handled my checkout and it was only 2 days ago. For a contrast, the Palomar across the street is quirky and memorable, in the fun way that seems to be a specialty of Kimpton's hotels, but I didn't stay there on this trip.The bar on the top floor is worth checking out, even if you don't drink. The view is really nice when the fog is out and when you can find a seat next to the windows. It's an expensive place to have a drink before dinner (4 of us each had a drink and the bill was over $50) but it's worth doing once.Sure, I'd go back without a complaint. But next time I'll probably stay somewhere else just for the variety."
141,2153,"Aug 6 2007 	Extremely clean and comfortable!!!!!	My husband and I just stayed here for our third anniversay this past weekend, and we just have all great things to say about this hotel!!!! It is super clean, spacious, comforatable, and central to downtown union square and close to the financial district! We loved it so much- we stayed in a corner room so the view was awesome- we could see the busy street w/ all the people and yet could barely hear a thing (and we were only on the 6th floor!) The bed was so nice too- the mattress was super comfy and the bedding was very clean and crisp and comfy! The TV was a large flat screen (which my husband loved) and the bathroom was very nice and modern with granite(?) type floors and large bath tub. Even the smell of the room was nice! The location is so great as well- it took us only 5 minutes to get to the Bart station off of Powell, and three minutes to get to a Walgreens for water or snacks. The location also feels very safe and within minutes to great shopping and places to eat. We didn't rent a car- all we did was walk and maybe catch a cab if we were to go to fishermans warf (only $13 BTW via cab) We actually walked to Fishermans warf from our hotel and it only took us about 20 minutes- we cut through the financial district and it was such a pretty walk. You should stay here - well worth it and the staff is also super friendly and helpful!"
142,2153,"Aug 5 2007	Fabulous	Our family had the BEST vacation we have EVER had! I used one of the best websites ever. It is called airfarewatchdog.com. They gather ALL search engines in one place. I receive a daily update on airfare prices. I happened to find a great flight out of Phoenix. The search engine with the best price was Travelocity. I then combined it with the hotel and they gave us a rate of $1800.00. This included 4 roundtrip tickets and with 2 rooms at this Marriott. We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms were quite large and our kids had an adjoining room. Marriott is always my first choice. This one hotel was the cream of the crop in terms of service, cleanliness and hospitality. We did have one night where a room near us was having a bachelorette party. Needless to say, the were LOUD. We complained and someone quickly warned them. They toned it down for about 5 minutes and revved it up again. We called again. Management came and pulled 16 people out of the room. Unfortunately, the few that remained managed to be loud again. We called again and all people were removed. Security and management were both involved. Our room was compt and the manager personally apologized. They were quite embarrassed and very apologetic. We were very satisfied even though we had lost a couple of hours of sleep due to this problem.Regardless, the room was clean with VERY comfortable beds. Those are my two priorities. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and friendly. There's a Starbuck there, a nice restaurant and concierge desk that was helpful and friendly. They gave us great advise on places. It was also helpful to have a car rental place (Hertz) on site. We rented a car whenever we left San Francisco and it was cheaper to rent only when we needed one (daily) than parking the car. Great advise given by a hotel employee.The location of the hotel is also ideal. We were about 1 block away from a location where we could catch a street car. A Walgreen's close by, which helps when you forget as many things as we did. And of course, your in the middle of a shopping mecca.Honestly, I did not want to leave. This is the first time I really felt comfortable in a hotel. I can't wait to go back and I hope anyone else who stays there has the same wonderful experience we had with the exception of the bachelorette party."
143,2153,"Aug 3 2007 	Love this Marriott	The rooms are big and confortable, the views are superb, the staff is helpful; what else can you ask for?We booked trough Priceline and checked in late, at about 8:00pm; therefore, I though we were going to be given the &quot;left over &quot; room, but was surprised by he staff's treatment. They asked what type of bed and room (smoking or not) I wanted and gave us a room on the 16th floor with views of the Yerbabuena Gardens and the Metreon.Overall a great stay!!"
144,2153,"Jul 28 2007 	Great Choice	My family of four (including a 6 and 8 year old) stayed here for 5 days in late July. We had a very positive experience. The room was clean and service was efficient and unobtrusive. The gym is presently being redone, but all of the equipment is available in carpeted conference rooms on the 4th floor and this should be done in August. The pool was great for San Francisco hotels, with a large hot tub. The hotel atrium restaurant was actually a pleasant surprisethe service quick, food good and prices comparable to other local places. I found the location of the hotel to be good, mainly due to proximity to the excellent public transportation in the city. There is a Whole Foods supermarket that has prepared food 3 blocks away; the cable car and Union Square are equally close. I would strongly urge travellers to familiarize themselves with the public transportation before goingwe did not have a car and felt no need to have one. You can easily and cheaply get to all attractions with public transportation (including an inexpensive trip to the airport on BART with a station a half block from the hotel). For example, we took the trolly bus (# 30 or 46 both work) to a Giants game for $4 for the 4 of us. AT&amp;T Park is about 7 blocks from the hotel. A cab from the airport is $35 before tip. My only complaint is that some parts of the surrounding neighborhood is a little rough around the edges, with more homeless people than I am accustomed to similar areas in Philadelphia or New York. I never felt threatened, but this did come as a surprise to me. Overall, I would definitely return."
145,2153,"Jul 26 2007 	A nice stay at a nice hotel in an excellent area	We spent 3 mights at the hotel, beginning July 22 and had a very nice stay.We arrived at the location to be informed we needed to go to a different area for parking / check-in. What made this initial annoying experience a good one was the fact they had personnel at the curb to direct you and a pre printed map with driving directions to the correct entrance. It was a nice touch.Check-in was fine and quick. Bell service was prompt and friendly. We parked at the hotel and while it outrageously expensive ($49.02 a night), it is very convenient. We proceeded to our room which was on the 14th floor in the mid-rise tower. The room was well appointed, spacious and clean. There was a nice bathroom and a great flat screen tv. Another excellent feature was the &quot;wired room&quot; concept. A centralized station where you can connect your laptop, Ipod etc. Listened to our Ipod on the flat screen much of the stay.We visited the Starbucks in the lobby but didin't use any other food outlet. The gym is currently in transition and located in a banquet room. Although the location isn't ideal, the equipment is brand new and top notch. This is a temporary gripe.Our only problem at all during the stay was when we first arrived at the room, the sheets on the bed were dirty and ripped. While I would not have expected to see such, a single phone call was all that was needed for prompt action. The service manager apologized to excess, and within 2 or 3 minutes (I swear, and this place has 1,500 rooms), the housekeeping manager was in our room. He too apologized and offered something to make up for the very modest inconvenience (we didn't take him up on any offer as none was truly needed). He promised a housekeeper would be up momentarily to change the sheets and again within a couple moments she appeared as well.All in all it was a very pleasant stay. At $140 a night plus tax, I think it was a fair price for a very nice, centrally located property with employees who care about your experience."
146,2153,"Jul 25 2007 	Great central location especially for 1st timers	Went to SF for the first time with my husband for a conference which was held there. We got the room for $140 via priceline. The hotel itself is in a great location, in the heart of downtown, close to Chinatown and steps from the BART (metro). I was a little upset because when we called they told us that the only ways to get there from the airport were by taxi ($45) or supershuttle ($16/pp) a nd so we took a cab. Turned out, you can take the metro (which we did on the way back) for $5/pp. to the POWELL station which is a block away from the hotel.The beds and the pillows are amazing, it is like floating on a cloud. I actually looked up the pillows brand to get some for my bedroom. The coffee offered in the room is really good.WARNING: parking at the hotel is $50 a day so try to find an alternative solution if you dont want to spend that much in parking.TIP: internet is about $13 a day in the room or $4/15min in the busin ess center. Right across the street at &quot;Organic coffee&quot; you can use there computers of a lot cheaper or yours for $5 a day. Someone told me there was a SOny station across the street that was free butI did not see it."
147,2153,"Jul 20 2007 	Excellent but overpriced	I stayed 8 nights in this hotel. for a conference. While it is a great place, it is very pricey, there is no breakfast and the place is very impersonnal. The room was nice, clean, confortable but i did not think it was worth the $250 a night price tag. Room service was expensive and very average: we ordered a burger which was burnt and uneatable. Location is ideal though and staff as helpful as may be expected in such high standing hotel. The sky bar is fantastic and well worth the view but i did feel pressurised to keep ordering:"
148,2153,"Jul 19 2007 	Great Property - Great Stay	I had a great stay at this property. Good room service, great breakfast restaurant. Accomodating staff."
149,2153,"Jul 18 2007 	A good stay	A three day stay on business . Got a good rate at $129 per night. Nice clean and spacious room, must have been upgraded recently - good standard of furnishings, LCD TV with HD channels. Hotel location is good, close to Union square etc. I would stay again, helpful staff ."
150,2153,Jul 17 2007 	Great Location but Avoid the Valet Hotel Parking!!!	The hotel itself is in an excellent location. Union Square is within walking distance as is the Financial District and Nob Hill. We did take a cab to Fishermans Wharf which was under $15.00 and the Cable Car back to Powell Street for $5.00. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The only bad thing I could say about the hotel was the Hotel Parking was horrible. They charge $49.00 a day and if you check out on a Sunday like we did expect to wait for your car for over an hour. If I stay at this Hotel again I will take BART which drops you off at the Powell Street Terminal and is less than a 10 minute walk to your Hotel.
151,2153,"Jul 12 2007	This Hotel was First Class	I stayed here from Jun 28 to July 3rd and loved it! The location of the hotel is excellent, especially if you have not been to SF before.You are literally around the corner from the Powell Underground Station where you can catch all the MUNI or BART trains. You are alsoaround the corner from the F line of Above Ground Streetcars, and also a block from the Famous Cable Cars. Located on the edge of the Financial District you are also just a stones throw from Union Square. The shopping all around the hotel is exceptional from favourites like Macys right up to high end stores like Cartier or Neiman Marcus. The staff of the hotel are wonderful, pleasant, customer service oriented and very helpful. The concierge staff are particulary helpful and seem to genuinely love thier city. The lobby of this hotel is always bustling, but my room and floor were always peaceful and relaxed. The room had a lovely large Plasmatelevision and great view of the City. The bedding is wonderful and the housekeeping was excellent too. There is a starbucks in the lobby if you like them, as well there are2 in house restaurants. On the 39th floor you will find &quot;the View&quot; a cocktail bar with amazing views from every angle of the city. Worth a look and a few pics.I would not hesitate to stay here again. Be sure to check the hotel website for deals.....my room was at a rate of $159.00 per night, and it was normally $449.00This hotel is wonderful.....check it out."
152,2153,"Jul 12 2007	Quite pleased except for parking fee	Enjoyed the prime location of the hotel and the plush amenities of remodeled rooms. Rate was $151/night for two weekend nights. Didn't enjoy the view of the internal &quot;courtryard&quot; (room of low-rise portion of hotel) from the 4th floor - though I asked for a low floor - so have nothing to really complain about.One real bummer was the $49/night (incl tax) valet parking. That's the steepest I've seen, NYC or otherwise. Had a $100 Marriott gift certificate to use - so didn't think twice - but this would perhaps sway my vote on another trip..."
153,2153,"Jul 6 2007	First class accommodation	With close to 1500 rooms this is a huge property. The facilities were first class and the staff very responsive and cheerful. All in all a great place to stay. Good location. There is lots of shopping around and plenty of restaurants. The cable-car is just around the corner off Market St. and thats where you will also find the F train, the Muni and BART. In other words, all the transportation options you want are right around the corner. By the way, if you use the transit system (excl BART) and plan to be in town for three days or more, get yourself a three-day pass for $18.Ask the very helpful concierge service for restaurant recommendations and even to make you a reservation. I highly recommend a family-run Italian restaurant a short walk away called Pazzia. Its very small so make a reservation.My room was good but quite small. The bed was comfortable.The interconnect connection requires an ethernet cable and they claim to charge $12.95/day for the right to connect, which in my opinion is a money-grab. If you need it, see if you can get internet connection thrown into your room rate.The bathroom was very small. If anyone from the Marriott is reading this review, please pass on to the hotel manager that it would be a good idea to have more than one towel hook in the bathroom for wet towels. I am certain I went through more towels than I would have, had I had a place to hang them to dry. In other words, a towel rack would actually pay for itself in terms of reduced laundry costs.The fitness facilities are currently under renovation and all equipment is located in temporary conference rooms. Having said that, the equipment is brand new and fantastic. Will be even better once the TV connections to the cardio equipment are properly installed.Overall a great place to stay.Safe travels - thedonk"
154,2153,"Jul 4 2007 	Great hotel with great location!	YOu cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is a BART ride from the airport. The BART stop is literally outside the door of the hotel. It is next to the huge mall with great gourmet fast food. Beard Papa is behind the hotel and you can get yummy cream puffs. It is an easy walk to Union Square, China Town, etc.. The staff is very professional and courteous. I get such attitude if the room is booked via Priceline when I am at ANY Hitlon. So naturally I was a bit apprehensive. Well I was so wrong! The check in lady could not do enough to accomodate my needs!!! I was shocked! Had a room that overlooks the bay bridge. Room was immaculate! The housekeeping staff is the best. We had an offer for turn down service nightly with the best chocolates!!! On the last night, we were given more chocolates and a beautiful post cards. Hated to pay for internet but that is a minor issue. I will stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!"
155,2153,"Jul 1 2007 	Very nice stay but a few housekeeping issues	Stayed last week on business. This is a very nice business hotel. Quiet, comfortable rooms, great plasma TV, A few negative experiences during the stay...On check in, bathroom was obviously not cleaned well, as there was hair from previous guests on the floor. Bath towel had a hole in it. Sheets on bed probably need to be updated for the larger mattresses. My fitted sheet never fit during the entire 5 night stay.One nice thing is the business office provides up to 20 complimentary pages/faxes. Drawback is the $4.00 per 15 minutes internet charge. Alternatively, you can have $14 per day unliimited in your room. I've never quite understood why moderate price hotels frequently offer free internet. Higher end hotels routinely charge for it.The shoe shine guy was extremely nice and does a great job with your shoes. I highly recommend him.In summary, this was a very nice stay. I'd return without hesitation."
156,2153,"Jun 19 2007 	Wonderful Marriott Great Location	Located on Fouth Street right off Market near the Powell Street Cable Car turnaround couldn't be a better location. No car needed once you've parked. I guess that was the only downside, valet is $49 per night, but worth the price for security. The hotel is extremely comfortable and the service great. Rooms are spacious and relaxing."
157,2153,"Jun 18 2007 	Way Cool!!	Went to SF for a raiders, steelers game. The hotel is very nice! We had a great view from our window of the bridges. I would stay again."
158,2153,"Jun 9 2007 	Enjoyable stay at SF Marriott	I recently stayed at the San Franciso Marriott on business, and I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to others seeking a nice hotel at a reasonable cost. The hotel was within a 10-minute walk to Union Square, and a $10 taxi ride to Fisherman's Wharf.Check-in was quick and courteous, and my requests for a high floor and city view were honored. As my Marriott Rewards profile indicates that we prefer a refrigerator, the person doing check-in offered to have one delivered, as that particular room did not have one. I declined, but thought it nice that it was offered.The room itself was very comfortable. The long desk was along the window wall, from which I had a glorious view of the Bay Bridge. The large, flat screen TV was a nice touch. The hard-wired Internet connection worked very well and log-in instructions were easy to follow. I slept well as the bed was comfortable and outside noise was at a minimum.My only negative comment about the room was that there was no safety deposit box. These were available at the front desk, yet I'd much rather have one in the room.My business associate and I sought the concierge for advice on places to dine and received wonderful advice. We had lunch at the Sushi Boat, near Union Square, and dinner at McCormick &amp; Schmick's. For the latter, the concierge suggested we arrive early for dinner, and we were seated with no wait.Visitors desiring a hotel closer to Union Square and/or tourist attractions might think this hotel somewhat inconvenient -- in fact, we made a wrong turn walking back from Union Square, but found our way again courtesy of a map provided by the concierge. Still, I would certainly stay here again."
159,2153,Jun 4 2007 	Not recommended	We arrived and checked in to a room which had been used by a previous guest. They did not seemed surprised by this but did move us immediately to a clean room. The bell staff jump on you (literally) to get your luggage and we politely declined help on three occasions. Still they came to drag it away from us and in the process made us trip over them and send the luggage flying. They fight amongst themselves to get to the guests first so they can get a tip which is rude and intrusive. This only seems to happen in the States and I believe that gratutities should be at the guests discretion. I believe in rewarding good service. Also I do believe that it is their jobs to provide a service to guests and this service (if it is good) should be rewarded. If I want to take my own luggage then I should be able to do this without feeling that they want a tip for just opening doors or smiling. One of the concierge answered an outside call when we were in the middle of talking to him. The rooms are adequate but without a fridge. Beds are very comfortable. Housekeeping turned the air conditioning on and then left the windows open. What is the sense in this?! Location is good. Staff appear disinterested and lacking in common customer service skills. If you must stay here then I advise:Do not park here. They charge $50 a night PLUS TAX and you can't take your car out and bring it back in the same day without being charged another $50. Park at one of the public car parks which are close by and significantly cheaper (5th and mission or gardens)
160,2153,"Jun 4 2007	Nice Hotel and Great Location	I found my stay at the San Francisco Marriott to be a good experience. Front desk staff was courteous. The lobby, halls, elevators, and rooms were kept to high standards. The room we stayed in (two beds, no view) comfortably accommodated two people, and two more would fit in as needed. The beds were very comfortable, and the LCD TV was a nice touch. (Too bad only Discovery came in HD!)Views from the lounge on the top floor were stellar. The pool and hot tub were bustling with people, and there was a good cross section of hotel guests in the latter--not just children and seniors. (The pool was almost entirely used by children.) Also, the in-lobby snack shop was handy when we didn't feel like walking to the nearby Walgreens for a candy bar.There were five things that made the visit a 4-star experience and not a 5-star experience: 1. No TV channel guide is provided. 2. The windows are excessively dirty. 3. Free wi-fi Internet access is not available. 4. The water pipes vibrate slightly in the wall when many people take showers at once. 5. There are no personal touches, such as complimentary coffee in the lobby or mints on the pillows.I would suggest this hotel to others. In fact, I have friends that have stayed here before. The San Francisco Marriott is in a handy location for Bay Area locals: Since the hotel is south of Market, one won't get stuck in the crowds around Union Square when driving in or walking to/from BART and Muni. But all that hustle and bustle is just a couple minutes away!"
161,2153,"Jun 3 2007 	Good but not great	Stayed here for a builder's convention....nice beds, good location. That is about it. Oh, there is a Starbucks downstairs....besides that this hote has no charm and must be located near a fire station because I heard sirens a lot more than when I used to stay at the Grand Hyatt up the street on Stockton. During our stay I threw a party in the Presidential Suite for my company and the room was so poorly decorated it was straight out of a 1980's movie. Just outdated and poor use of space. If you are staying in the city and want a great hotel, go to the Hotel Vitale. Way worth the money!!!!"
162,2153,"May 31 2007 	Very Nice	An excellent convention/business hotel. Very convenient. Great location overall. Rooms are clean and spacious. Nice flat screen Tvs. Very good fitness facility and pool area. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay. I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and the Mandarin Oriental in SF before and the Marriott was much nicer than the Grand Hyatt and not really that much inferior to the Mandarin but at half the price."
163,2153,"May 30 2007 	Lots of action is nearby this hotel	Nice beds! After staying in a Hyatt on this trip, this bed was noticably better. And the location is excellent for the popular Union Square, Moscone Center and Yurba Buena facility. The lobby was nothing special and the windows were terribly dirty. Otherwise, the room had nice amenities and the staff was friendly."
164,2153,May 24 2007 	Very Convenient to Moscone Center	This hotel is a very convenient stay for those who are attending the Moscone Center because its such a short walk. The hotel itself was really nice and I have no complaints what so ever. Our room had a wide-screen tv and the beds were really comfortable. I had some down time while I was there and also loved the fact that the hotel is within walking distance to tons of shops. The hotel serves Starbuck
165,2153,"May 21 2007	Wonderful Vacation	Great vacation! Stay in the hotel with my daughter, she was here for a conference. Staff were friendly and very knowlegdable about the surrounding areas. Great room and services."
166,2153,"May 12 2007 	Typical Marriott good location	The San Francisco Marriott is a great choice if you are attending a convention at Moscone. Only a block away, it's a relief not to have to walk too far after spending a whole day on your feet at a convention.It is a standard, full-service Marriott. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are an okay size for being downtown. Overall, it didn't leave me with an overwhelming impression one way or the other, which is sad because I really wanted to be impressed by the hotel. The service was good and the bellmen especially helpful. Room service was the typical Marriott menu. Yet, I'm frustrated by the charge for internet service.There are several good restaurants close by, with a movie theatre across the street. The Whole Foods Market is a few blocks away if you want to get some nice snacks. I would probably stay here again for convenience sake because how close it is to the convention center. However, if I was staying in San Fran for other reasons, the Fairmont and the Palace would be my first choices."
167,2153,"May 9 2007 	Great Location!	The location is perfect and the concierge can get you anywhere very easily. They gave me directions to take the bus with my daughters to Golden Gate Park. It was very simple to do and cost $2.50 each way.The room was average. I had asked to be close to the elevator and got the room behind the elevator. The elevator made noise with each passing but it wasn't awful. A distant swooshing sound but it might disturb others. The view was average, as a Marriott rewards elite member I was hoping for better, especially since the room was no &quot;deal&quot;.The room had the updated linen's but was rather small and no luggage rack for the suitcase. I'm not crazy about the decor, it looks like it is from Target. Silver mirror and lamp rather dull. The TV was a very large flat screen and I don't think there was a mini-bar but don't me on that.The lobby is busy but the service to the front desk was walk up and the bell captian was plesant. The sports bar at the hotel was OK. No table service during the week, you order at the bar and sit yourself. Plenty of TV's and the food was adequate."
168,2153,"Apr 28 2007 	Good Location and quality	We picked this hotel as we wanted something reliable in a good location. We weren't disapointed. You are right next to the best shopping mall Downtown (Bloomingdale's/Nordstom's) and only 1 block from the Powel St cable car and Union Sq. The hotel was well maintained and the room well equiped, but no mini-bar or fridge. We did have a wide-screen HD television and a good selection of channels. We didn't have a great view but could just see the bay bridge between other buildings (on 29th floor). The room and all common areas we well decorated and clean. The viewing lounge on the 39th floor is well worth a visit. The only bad thing to say was that if you wanted to use the decent swimming pool you had to either change in the toilet or pay $5 each in the health club, which we thought was free from the web site."
169,2153,"Apr 25 2007	No complaints	We stayed here during my wife's conference at the Moscone Center. I will start with the negatives of the hotel...there aren't really any accept if you are looking for a very quiet place to stay. This is b/c this hotel is close to the convetion center and can get very busy and loud in the common areas (not the rooms). Well maybe another negative is that parking is more expensive than the parking garages across the street. Other than that the hotel was great:Good service from house keeping and the front desk.Room was clearn, large and had a comfortable bed and working area.The location is close to shopping, the convetion center, Cal Train, BART and the trolley lines.The fitness center was one of the best I have used at any hotel. Its got three large rooms with plenty of good equipment. It also has a pool, but i didn't use it."
170,2153,"Apr 24 2007 	Stale odor	The check-in was quick, the valet was quick, the room was clean and had a nice view (corner, 25th floor) but the non-smoking room had a musty stale odor. For $350/nt, I should smell nothing. After 30 minutes I checked out and went across the street to the Palomar, which accommodated me without a reservation, for $199/nt and the room had no odor whatsoever. The Palomar is also a quiet, low key boutique hotel, whereas the Marriott is overcrowded."
171,2153,Apr 7 2007	Very helpful - even for Priceline Customers	I've booked the Marriott via Priceline for 100 $ per night and contacted the hotel afterwards via email to ask for 2 double beds. About three hours later I got an answer with a reservation number guaranteeing me 2 double beds. I think that's a great service. I'm looking forward to my stay in september.
172,2153,"Mar 31 2007	Beware priceline guests!	Expect a very poor front desk attitude when you book through priceline. I haven't stayed at the hotel yet but based on my phone room request i guess i won't have a high expectation, and just have to manage fine without expecting service. I won the room through priceline for $89 a night, what a steal right? Why would i be complaining already? Well i was very excited, right after my reservation was confirmed, called the hotel directly for room request eventhough my trip to SF is still 4 months away. Priceline stated that special request on rooms should contact the hotel directly, so i did. I never ever been treated so low before at any other hotels i've stayed in. Through some of the reviews i read i guess a lot of people that have booked the hotel through priceline feel the same way? I'm not really fussy at all when staying at a hotel, my only request was just to have a room with 2 queen/2 double beds and maybe a refridgerator since i'm still breastpumping. The lady i spoke to (Georgia)refused to let me make any special request and keep stating that I book my room through Priceline( as if I don't have rights to make any special request, and just be happy that i even got a room at the hotel for such bargain) And she also didn't want to even let me know what type of room i'll have. Feeling frustated I contacted Priceline and they took care of me. This is the first time I booked hotel through Priceline. I really recomend Priceline for their customer satisfaction and profesionalism but Do Not recomend this hotel even if you have a good deal. I will write another review after my SF trip."
173,2153,"Mar 22 2007 	Great Location in SF	The hotel is huge! and fairly nice. The people are polite. The lobby is big. The carpet is a little dated and makes the hallway smell a little funny. But other than that, everything was great. The room and the bed are wonderful. The sheets and bed are soft and comfortable. It's so much better than my bed at home. The hotel is in a great location and in the heart of downtown. It's across the street from the SONY Metreon and the Moscone Center. It's also a few blocks from Union Square. It's about 1.5 blocks from the BART. You can also take the BART to and from SFO (airport). There is plenty of shopping and resaurants in the surrounding area. It's about 3 blocks from the famous 7 story Nordstrom's. There's also free internet. You can take the bus to Fisherman's Wharf. Valet parking is a little expensive so if you don't have to get a car, don't. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone!"
174,2153,"Mar 20 2007 	Great Location 	As Marriott Rewards members, my husband and I accrue points for staying at Marriott and Courtyard hotels, and recently we decided to use some points for a free night at the SF Marriott. We visited family and saw the sights while we were there.Marriott treats its Rewards customers like royalty. No standing in line to check in; rooms are upgraded at no extra charge whenever available; service of all kinds is outstanding. Our room was in the corner with a gorgeous view of the city and a peek of the Bay between buildings. The king-sized bed was the second most comfortable I've ever slept in (the best was in Zagreb, Croatia--a bit far to go for a good night's sleep!). The linens were smooth and fresh. The room temperature was perfect, and although the hotel is located in the middle of one of the busiest areas of the city, it was very quiet!The bar on top has an excellent view of the city, and although the drink prices are a bit high, one is also paying for the view and the good service. We did not dine at the hotel that evening.I was only disappointed with two things: The buffet breakfast, which contained an excellent variety of dishes, was cold. I especially can't stand cold scrambled eggs, and theirs were cooler than room temperature. The meats and french toast weren't much warmer.The other shock (it is San Francisco, I realize) was the $50 per day parking fee. Wow! I was prepared for $25 or $30, but that was a bit much. I highly recommend the hotel, however, if you can stand the parking fee. You might want to walk up the street to &quot;Sears Fine Food&quot; (not affiliated with the dept. store) for pancakes for breakfast or to one of the bakeries nearby."
175,2153,Mar 14 2007	Great Hotel in SFO	While visiting a friend in San Francisco I stayed at the Marriott. I was first amazed at the size of the hotel and it seemed to be the convention headquarters. At check-in I requested a nice size room with a city view and that's exactly what I received. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and always asked me if there was anything they could do. This location is perfect if you looking for a central location to everything San Francisco has to offer.
176,2153,Feb 14 2007 	Great hotel in a great location	Hotel was great. There was nothing to fault about the rooms which were pretty large for a city hotel.The reception service was good with cookies waiting on reception during check in!The hotel is extremely busy almost 24 hours a day but this is mainly down to its excellent location. It is literally a 3 minute walk from Union Square.I would return to the SF Marriott with any second thought. Do not forget to check out the amazing views from the bar on the top floor!!
177,2153,"Feb 2 2007	Poor Hotel	There are so many things wrong with this hotel that it is hard to find any positives apart from the location and the bed.The concierge was singularly unhelpful on the four occasions we consulted them for advice and reservations; the restaurant is appallingly managed - we were asked to take a ticket and stand in line behind 20 other guests one morning for breakfast. When I complained I was told in no uncertain terms to use the &quot;Starbucks&quot; in the lobby! The maid service is perfunctory to say the least; old newspapers were not removed daily and the room remained untidy even after service. In fact one day a service box was left in our room and remained for three days! The service in &quot;The View&quot; was terrible with a surly barman grudgingly providing &quot;service&quot; such as it was.This is a big, characterless and total impersonal hotel. It seems to attract the business traveller with it's easy access to the local conference centre who seem incapable of excercising any kind of discretion or tact when doing &quot;business&quot; in the public areas.Avoid unless desperate."
178,2153,"Feb 1 2007 	Marriott should be ashamed	I attended a large conference at the San Francisco Marriott in January of 2007. I attend alot of large conferences, so I have many experiences to compare this to. There were two dreadful things about this hotel. First was the fact that four people in our group reported having blood stains in their rooms. Either on the floor or the bedsheets. These were official reports made through security. Who knows how many other &quot;stains&quot; were found and not reported. The second abomination was the food. Every single meal, from buffet to formal banquet was horrible. I did not eat at any of the restaurants or order room service, so I can't speak to that. Other than those two glaring negatives, the hotel is mediocre. It's biggest benefit is its location near Union Square. The second floor bar area was nice, and the bartenders friendly. The rooms were worn and old-looking. There was no mini-bar, safe, robe, or other nice amenities. I've stayed at many other hotels in downtown San Fran and would certainly consider those before returning to the SF Marriott."
179,2153,"Jan 19 2007 	Terrific Hotel	We just returned from an awesome trip to SanFrancisco. The Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf is a terrific Hotel. We arrived at the Hotel at 11 AM expecting just to leave our luggage with the Bellman until check-in time. We were warmly welcomed and given a room immediately. Everyone at the Marriott was friendly and very helpful. We'd highly recommend this hotel for it's clean rooms, friendly staff, location and service."
180,2153,"Jan 18 2007 	Simply no issues - Great Stay!	We travel to the City about once per year for a weekend get-a-way. We booked the Marriott through priceline for about $90 per night and expected the worst (as it seems many hotels treat the priceline purchasers as second-class citizens.)Our experience was entirely positive. We arrived at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday and our room was already ready . The King bed we asked for was provided and was very comfortable. The room was nothing amazing, but it was large and clean as was the bathroom. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times.The hotel is located just South of Market and is a quick walk to Union Square, North Beach and nearby museums. I wouldn't hestiate to recommend the Marriott . If I had paid $300 per night, I might not have been so happy, but at the priceline rate it was a steal."
181,2153,"Jan 5 2007 	A nice stay at SF Marriott	We stayed at SF Marriott on Dec. 30 and had a wonderful experience. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the room was brightly lit. Some hotel rooms are not bright enough for reading even when all the lights are on. SF Marriott did not have this problem. The location was close to many major attractions. The valet staff was very helpful. Look forward to staying at SF Marriott again!"
182,2153,Jan 3 2007 	Thank you for the room change!!	My wife and I were staying at the Marriott Downtown for December 30 and the 31st. The first night our room was adjacent to some early New Years Partyers. We kept thinking the noise would stop so we did not call security. The next day we voiced our concern with the front desk and we were promptly given another room on another floor. No questions nor hesitations (I am sure the hotel computer showed us as Priceline guests.....not a mention except for apologies for our inconvieniences). New Years Eve night was great.. Thank you to the management for making our stay First Rate!
183,2153,"Jan 1 2007 	One of my favorites!	Wonderful location in SoMa, across from Yerba Buena park, close to Moscone for meetings, near Union Square and SF Centre for shopping, 2 blocks from Powell St cablecar terminus and Halliday Plaza BART. A little too &quot;convention-y&quot; but perks make up for thisService excellent, rooms immaculate Would be nice if it had in-room coffee and free internet"
184,2153,"Dec 27 2006	Real dissappointment	We've stayed at the SF Marriott (&quot;Jukebox&quot;) previously without complaint but this time was really bad. Check In was extremely slow. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed in our room, there was a slimy substance on the nightstand and the bathroom had some nasty looking stuff on the tile floor. What's worse, the bed had sharp little feathers poking through the sheets that poked us all night and given the level of the room's overall cleanliness, we wondered when the sheets had last been changed.We called the front desk after discovering the room conditions immediately, they apologized and said they'd send housekeeping right away. We went out for a &quot;night on the town&quot;. Upon returning we found chocolates on the pillows but nothing had been cleaned. By that time it was quite late so we just went to bed.We normally stay at Marriott's both nationally and internationally, typically 12-15 nights each year. This was the worst experience we've had anywhere."
185,2153,"Dec 11 2006 	A Good Stay	We've just returned from a three night stay at the Mariott. The staff was very helpful and always with a smile. The room and the bathroom were very clean and the bed very comfortable. The room size, though somewhat small, was typical of the size you would get at any major city . The bar on the 37th floor offers magnificent view of the city and is well worth the ride up the elevator. The hotel is in a great location. It is near the shopping center, a 10 minute walk from China Town, a very short walk to the cable car, and around the corner from SF muesum of modern art. This hotel is a great place for both buisness and pleasure."
186,2153,"Nov 13 2006 	Awesome Place	We booked our room through Priceline.com and got a beautiful room for $125 a night on Friday and Saturday. Everything and everyone from the valet service to housekeeping was fantastic. The valet was full of information and was extremely kind. The bellboys were awesome. The front desk people more than went out of their way to help us. And the room was clean, newly-renovated, and extremely comfortable. The beds were to die for. The only drawback was that parking was $49 a night at the hotel. The valet recommended that we park just down the street at the Mission and Fifth Garage...we parked there for the whole weekend for $46. This hotel is close to shopping, close to the Powell/Market cable car stop, and is within footsteps to some of the world's best restaurants. Even the breakfast buffet at the hotel was great. We would stay here again any day!!!!"
187,2153,"Nov 2 2006	A very busy place!	I came away with several impressions from my three-night stay. First, the Marriott is a very bustling and busy place. Lots of covention traffic. While I was there on vacation, the lobby was a vibrant center of activitiy. Yet once on my floor and my room, this was a great place to unwind and relax. I loved the oversized desk that overlooked the San Francisco skyline. No complaints at all with the room. The breakfast buffet was all I could ask for. Hotel location close to some good shopping and transportation to tourist attractiions. Staff was friendly and helpful. Visited the lounge on the 37th floor and it offered a great view, although a bit too crowded for me to enjoy a drink. But I can't fault it for being popular. This is really a business/conference hotel and probably is not geared to the typical tourist. Nonetheless, I was very satisfied with the accomodations and location of the Marriott. for my needs."
188,2153,"Oct 29 2006 	Had a great time	We got an excellent rate on Priceline for the Marriott. My husband and I stayed for three nights. Although the Marriott lacks some of the ambiance and character that the smaller boutique hotels have, it hits everything else right on the head. Customer service was great. We were promptly checked in with a smile. Our request for a king room with a view was granted without question. Our bags were brought to us in our room, which was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was very large, new, and spotless. The shower was great and we always had hot water. There is a full sized iron and ironing board in the room. The bed was very soft, there is a thick down featherbed on top of the mattress. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in as far as hotels go. I didn't want to leave the bed in the morning!The hotel's location is also superb. It is on 4th and Market, right in the middle of the shopping district. The entrance to the bart/muni is literally right outside the hotel. There are buses, cable cars, and street cars right there at the intersection to take you anywhere in the city. There is a brand new upscale mall right across from the hotel which made for some exciting shopping. There is a bar at the top of the hotel on the 39th floor. My husband and I went up one night just to see the view, and it was beautiful. The bar has very tall floor to ceiling windows. We were unable to have a drink because the bar was so crowded.In summary, the hotel was great. Very clean, employees always smiling and helpful, nice spacious room with soft bed. One complaint: paying for internet access. A hotel of this magnitude should have free in room wireless service, especially with the number of business travelers they accommodate."
189,2153,"Oct 24 2006 	Great bar ; Great hotel ;Great city	The staff, facilities, location were AAA. SF - Cool place, cool people. SF - f you ever get bored of the USA, why not detach yourself from the continent and come to Europe?A must to any resident however. You must travel in pairs. One must travel in a khaki two piece. The other in a Darth Vader outfit. Go to the top floor bar at opening time, and whilst it is empty, re-enact the light sabre scene from The Empire Strikes Back.Seriously, great bar. Great great bar. And we were travelling with a five month old boy (also a jedi) and we felt very welcome."
190,2153,"Oct 16 2006 	Genuine rip-off	My partner and I stayed at this hotel that we booked through priceline, and it felt as if we we're treated as &quot;lower tier&quot; humans for doing so. When we had a complaint, the clerk at the front desk made it a point to remind us that we booked our room through priceline, making us feel belittled and unworthy of staying at their establishment. Our complaint was that the clerk that registered us in charged $100 to our card, unbeknownst to us. The front desk manager, although apologetic and polite, stated he would call our bank and reverse the charges. The next day he promised us he did make the call. He never did, and our bank verified that no call was ever made. He told a bold faced lie right to our faces. And this was their manager! All of the front desk personnel we were in contact with really needed an attitude adjustment and/or a severe refresher course in good customer service.Unless you paid full price for one of their rooms, expect less than great customer service. The location and room itself were so-so, and as a previous poster said, they do try to gouge you for your money at every turn. No coffee pots in the rooms, which, for a 4-star hotel, should be a given. $13/day for internet; most other hotels I've stayed at offer free Wi-Fi. No alcohol can be brought in; they say it's the law (although I haven't found it anywhere online), even though they can serve it to you in their lounges and restaurants and charge exorbiant prices for it."
191,2153,"Oct 16 2006 	Great customer service	I love trip advisor and was pleased to read the reviews for the Marriottt when making our decision for where to stay in San Francisco. I have traveled to the city many times and wanted to be close to the shopping near Union Square. Pros:1) The location was awesome. Very convenient to all the downtown shops and restaurants.2) Comfortable bed and linens. The best I've had in a long time and we've stayed at 4-5 star hotels recently.3) Friendly staff. Very helpful and knowledgeable.4) Although a &quot;conference&quot; hotel, they treat all the guests well without the &quot;move-them-in and out&quot; mentality.5) Indoor pool.Cons:1) Very small fitness center. It gets very crowded in the mornings.2) Rooms were a little small with not a great view (but this is being picky)Overall, we had a great stay and didn't expect to have such great service for the size of the hotel. We will be staying there again next time we are back in the San Francisco."
192,2153,"Oct 7 2006 	Good business hotel	Recently stayed 5 nights at this hotel. Excellent location in San francisco, minutes from Union Square, and right next to new Westfield Mall/Bloomingdales! Good conference facilities, with seamless service and good food. Internet rates in business centre extortionate ($4 for 15 minutes). Lovely swimming pool. Room was spacious; bed excellent. No tea/coffee-making facilities in the room and limited room service options; no face flannels in bathroom; towels a little threadbare. Bed VERY comfortable. Recommend for business stays."
193,2153,"Oct 5 2006 	Best location for conferences	I stayed at the Marriot in September for a conference in the Moscone Center. San Francisco is a great place for a business trip because you can do all sorts of things without having a car, and I like walking. However, my usual hotel, the Omni, is a bit far from the Moscone Center, where most conferences are held. Depending on corpoate travel rates and the like, the Marriot may be more or less expensive than the Omni, but it's right across the street from the Moscone and the Metreon, and a short walk from the Financial District.My room on this stay was pleasantly large, clean, and well-appointed. For a business traveler or a conference-goer planning on a few extra days, the Marriot is a great choice. For a traveler on vacation, there may be better deals and more personal hotels than this behemoth, but the Marriot would be comfortable and convenient."
194,2153,"Oct 3 2006 	I listened to Tripadvisor about this one	As usual, Tripadvisor hit the nail right on the head! This is an awesome hotel and the reviewers helped me tremendously. I asked for a room in the high tower facing St. Patrick's Cathedral and it was delightful. One thing to be warned about, however: the &quot;double beds&quot; are more like enlarged singles. Actually, the man at the reception desk told my husband and me that he had &quot;a quiet bed with two beds in it&quot;. Hmmm, maybe we should have asked how large the beds were! Aside from this minor flaw, our stay was delightful. Dan at the concierge desk is the best and everyone we came in contact with in the hotel was very professional. Loved the pool, and yes, does have a bit too much chlorine. Did not like Mel's Diner, way too noisy and overdone. Had a very simple breakfast daily directly across the street at dear old Denny's. Had fantastic Chinese food at Far East on Grant where they have private rooms (!) and Kan's directly across. Try the Peking Duck. I want to go back just writing this!"
195,2153,"Sep 26 2006 	very nice	This hotel is very nice. I was just there for a very large conference. I read the reviews on this site and was a bit apprehensive by some comments. My husband was the one participating in the conference and I would basicly be on my own every day, during the day. The hotel is in a decent location (within walking distance to many places) On our way to Chinatown we were able to catch the &quot;Love Parade&quot; on Saturday.................interesting!! I didn't know men (only 3 but more than enough for my taste) could down a busy city street &quot;Buck Naked&quot;. My stomach hurt from laughing so hard. Sorry guys there were no girls to follow suit. Also I got to see the motorcade of the King of Sweden pass in front of the hotel. Not everyday that you get to see that. Anyway ...back to the hotel. Our king room was big enough for the 2 of us. The bed was fantastic. Thumbs up of that one. I read on this site that a coffee maker was not supplied, so I brought my own. The pot however broke during the flight. I called the front desk and they provided us with a coffee maker. It is 2 cups only but good enough to get me going. You just have to call the front dest and ask for it and it is provided at no charge. The internet service, however, is not. The conference that we attended picked up the tab on all of our internet service. If you are attending a conference, you should ask the front desk to see if your conference is the same. If that had not been our case I would have been upset. If you are reading this Marroitt, please consider changing this policy and making it comp. The conference that we attended demanded nothing but perfection and this hotel certainly stepped up to the plate. The receptions, food and staffing were top notch.We had a terrible view of a roof but we never requested a view so no complaints here.My recommendations: Mels Drive In across the street is great for a quick breakfast or lunch. Very busy, fast service, cute &quot;Happy Days&quot; decor, good food at a decent price.I didn't like the Bistro across the street for dinner. I thought it was over priced and I don't like to have to ask for an explanation of the items on the menu. This resturant just left a bad taste in my mouth. If you listen to one thing that I say, go the Beard Papa's right behind the marroitt. They have the best cream puffs that you have ever tasted. I had the vanilla bean and it was out of this world. I am not a sweet eater but I heard about this place and I couldn't resist. Wow, you just have to try it for yourself to see what I mean. Over all, I would say that this was a very pleasurable stay."
196,2153,"Sep 20 2006 	Nice position	We were only likely to go to San Francisco once, but we had five nights, so we were unconvinced about the location of this place - it seemed away from the sights, and in a 'business district'. But, its position was perfect for us - everything except Fisherman's Wharf was walkable - and it had a four star feel for a three star price.Hotel tip: don't be scared of the top floor bar. Nice folk, reasonable prices, no booking required.San Francisco tips:- book good weather! The Golden Gate was invisible for 24 hours; ah, but when it appeared in the sunshine...- give Alcatraz a miss, and be aware the boat that takes you there doesn't go under the Golden Gate bridge- for large groups (five of us) taxis are cheaper than public transport- go the Apple shop across the road from the Marriott- some restaurants have queues outside. This is because they are good. Got put off by a queue, and compromised by going to the empty place two doors down. Regretted it.- chill out at Golden Gate park, but don't expect a children's playground - it's closed for refurbishment"
197,2153,"Aug 28 2006 	Very comfortable stay	We took two rooms at the Marriott for three days. Our room had a beautiful nighttime view of the city and the other room overlooked the center for the arts. Both were very quiet. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The robes provided for our use were very, very nice. All areas of the hotel were very well maintained.The lobby was lovely. It was busy, but they moved the lines very quickly and the staff was professional. Dan the concierge was EXTREMELY helpful and even gave us his personal phone number should we need to call him. (Which we did!!)The exercise facility had bikes, ellipticals and treadmills as well as weights. They had individual TVs in the treadmillsthat played movies and complimentary headsets. The fitness area also had a spa- but I didn't get a chance to use those services. (Next time.)We had a great breakfast at the hotel every morning. They made omelets to order. Try the salsa! The lobby kiosk for the Starbucks had a long line one morning, but there was an excellent coffee shop right around the corner from the hotel and another Starbucks store across Market Street. (Out the door, make a right. Another right at the corner of Market, one block up and you are there. I think it was called the Coffee Beanery. Starbucks was across Market street from the Beanery -near the Bart station.)The 15, 30 and 45 buses stop right in back of the hotel- in front of the Office Max (Office Depot? some office supply store.) They will take you up to North Beach or Chinatown.Easy access to transportation. Quiet, comfortable beds. Friendly, helpful staff. I would not hesitate to stay there again."
198,2153,"Aug 24 2006 	Busy Busy Busy....	Being a loyal marriott customer, I was disappointed with our visit. First the good; great bed/mattress; slept wonderfully every night! The concierge, simply excellent - offered a lot of great activities and great advice on dining. The not so good; fitness center was too crowded; 3 of 5 days I visited there were not enough machines and temperature very hot inside. This is a very busy hotel and can get quite loud. The lobby was like grand central station at times. Some of the &quot;guests&quot; were rude. The staff at Marriott, as always very professional. The week we visited there was a convention; perhaps that was the issue...? Picked up the room for about $100 per night due to expedia special...if I paid the standard $200-$250; I would have been very upset!"
199,2153,Aug 23 2006 	loved the marriott san francisco the best	it was amazing from the moment you walk in. the lobby atrium has a reastarant which i had breakfast in and that was super and i someone who never likes to eat at hotels. the rooms are big by san francisco standards and the beds are amazing also the views are great. also the view lounge is awsome with great views and a nice place to have a drink. the location couldnt be better chinatown within walking distance(must eat at oriental pearl its the best chinese youll ever eat. recommended by hotel concierge.) also union sqaure is a short walk away. this hotel was by far the best it suited all my needs for my family and we had a great time.
200,2153,"Aug 22 2006 	OK for the price but wouldn't do it again...	I booked a room at the SF Marriott through Priceline. I figured even if I could not be assured of the exact location I desired, I would be able to count on a decent room. Basically this is what I got. The room itself was fine, if a bit dark (we were on the 8th floor). This is a very large hotel (39 floors) with a lobby that never sleeps in an area that seems pretty busy all the time as well. Location: If you go south on Market, more to the heart of the financial district, things are nice, the sidewalks clean, and even a few trees planted here and there. If you go north on Market, the streets gets dirtier, and the stores seedier. Sixth street, which is two blocks up, is particularly &quot;unscenic.&quot; Fourth St., where the hotel is located, appears to be the cutoff point for the neighborhood. Also, if the main entrance was on Market, rather than Fourth, it would be a big improvement. The main entrance is recessed, which is prob. appreciated when it rains, but looks dark and grungy, and the sidewalk on Fourth is narrow, which makes it crowded with all the tourists streaming in and out. Interiors: The interiors are fine, generally speaking, but one morning I walked to the elevator to find a pile of Cheetos on the floor, some of which had been ground into the carpeting. It was still there 2-3 hours later. Same thing with gum wrappers. This type of thing skeeves me out. The lobby is glitzy. There is a waterfall somewhere (used to mitigate lobby noise) and things like chandeliers and marble. However, all this being said, the basics were fine, and I could stand the shortcomings given that we had gotten a decent discount through Priceline. Still, I could not help but think everyone else passing through the lobby had gotten the same deal.In sum,the pros: *two blocks from the BART station*decent rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms*friendly, professional front desk staffthe cons: *dark, recessed entrance in slightly borderline area (in my opinion)*hallways outside rooms could be cleaner (saw ground Cheetos and bits of toilet paper on the carpeting)*a bit of nickel and diming (Internet and parking--parking is $49/day) but I suppose this is to be expected at a hotel that caters to business travelers who are getting reimbursed by their companies anyway"
201,2153,"Jul 27 2006 	LOVED the bed!	We stayed in the Marriott Downtown for 3 nights in mid-July. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was small, but very cozy, but we really loved the feather bed and pillows. As we got in the bed, we just sank into it. And we actually slept better in this bed than our own bed. In fact, we decided to order our own feather bed to put on top of ours at home. Everything was very clean and we really enjoyed our stay. We didn't have a good view, but we weren't in the room very much. They had a great breakfast buffet. It was pricey, but very good. We would like to stay there again if we ever make it to SF again."
202,2153,"Jul 26 2006 	Marriott for a conference	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott for a conference last week. It was a great conference property, large lobby, plenty of meeting space. Location was great for shopping- walk just a block or two and you will find a large selection of stores, ranging from Ross and Old Navy, to Macys and Nordstroms, up to Gucci and Armani. Short walk to cable car turnaround, about 8 blocks to Chinatown, 8 blocks to AT&amp;T Park. You will have to either wait for the trolleys to get to Ghiradelli or Fishermans wharf, or take a cab- they are not within walking distance. Never a wait to get a taxi at the hotel, doormen and conceirge are a great help."
203,2153,"Jul 19 2006	nice hotel	clean hotel, very friendly staff,stayed for two nights, a good distance from pier 39 but the cable car ride made it worth while. You have to hit the cable car ride at certain times to avoid the lines. (for those of you who dont know a trolley is the tourist version, but the locals call them cable cars because they are actually operated on underground cables). If you want to enjoy the exciting life of the Long wharf piers then stay closer to them and do your homework on which hotels are the closest."
204,2153,Jul 4 2006	Fantastic Bed!	Stayed here one night and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. The bed was first rate! ...a foam mattress with down pad on top. The room was quiet and nicely decorated. The only drawback was they did not have a coffee machine in the room and we needed to go downstairs for coffee.
205,2153,"Jun 17 2006	I recommend the San Francisco Marriott	I recommend the San Francisco Marriott and would stay there again. Our room was spotless with nice furniture, new carpeting, and a granite countertop in the bathroom. There were aways two people staffing the consierge desk to help with tourism needs. The cocktail lounge on the 39th floor has a great view, and breakfast is excellent with a lot of fresh fruit. The best part is the location with great shopping and restaurants a half-block away. The trolley and cable-car stops are up the street to take you to Fisherman's Wharf."
206,2153,"Jun 4 2006	Not bad but slightly disappointing	This was the first hotel of a few that we stayed in whilst in the US. We arrived by cab so parking wasn't an issue and the lobby staff were very friendly. They were aware that it was our honeymoon and we had a &quot;Deluxe Room City View&quot; but somehow it just wasn't anything special. Although we were on the 33rd floor, the view was alright but it wasn't anything special. The room wasn't very spacious compared to other rooms we had later on in our holiday and it wasn't really clean but it wasn't dirty either. It seemed clutted and cramped. That said, the bed was fantastic and it was fairly quiet. Initially, we ate breakfast in Mel's Diner across the other side of Mission Street which was a really nice way to start the day even though we were usually there between 6 and 7 in the morning. We didn't eat during the day or the evening in the hotel but we did have drinks in the Atrium Lounge in the evening. It was very comfortable and the staff were really friendly which is not what I could say about &quot;The View&quot; which is a bar on the 39th floor. The view is fantastic but it only opened at 4pm and was shut by midnight. If you could get anywhere near to the bar, the bar staff were just plain rude as they couldn't care less about serving you. On the last two days, we ate breakfast in the Garden Restaurant in the hotel and that was very good both with regards to the staff and to the food. Overall, it was a dissappointment."
207,2153,"Jun 1 2006	Marginal for the price	For the level of hotel this was, I was a bit disappointed. The rooms were not laid out very well. The host in the concierge lounge was not helpful (we resorted to talking with the concierge downstairs with better success). The indoor pool was nice, but the chlorine was overpowering. The workout facilities were small but had all the cardio equipment--plus small TV's on each piece of equipment. Nice touch. The valet service, while expensive, was top notch and in and outs are allowed and free. The front desk and bell hops were very good. Overall, for the price, I would probably stay at the Parc 55 or other top-o-the-line hotel. When I re-read this response, it sounds negative. The hotel was not bad in any way. It was a very nice, clean, quiet hotel. However, since I travel for work on a weekly basis, I was expecting more from this high-end hotel. From that perspective, I was let down a little. This is still a very, very nice hotel with excellent amenities, a great location, and a fair price."
208,2153,"May 31 2006	Great Hotel	Just returned from 3 days stay at the San Francisco Marriott Downtown.LOCATION: Its a nice hotel in SOMA close to MarketStreet and Museum of Modern Art. The neighborhood is nice and close to Market Street shopping, Muni train stationand many tourist attractions and is quite safe even late at night.ROOM: The room that was offered to me was anon-smoking disabled access room, so your roommight differ from these description about the room.The view of the city and MOMA was great from theroom. There is a separate high floor elevator thatprovides quick access to high floors with as fewstops as possible. The room and bathroom was very spacious. One thing that is noticably missing in the room was a mini-bar. I arrived late night and wanted some snack.The room service was closed and there was nomini-bar. Fortunately, there are quite a few 24 hourconvenience stores steps away from the hotel onMarket street.The carpet and furniture was little worn, but the linensand comforters were fresh and new.STAFF: The front desk staff was very nice and gave mea high floor room with view. Housekeeping staff wascourteous as well. Didn't have a chance to talk with concierge services - so can't comment on that.FACILITIES: The room has high speed wired internet access available for an extra $12.95. This charge alsoincludes unlimited local calling and unlimited domesticlong distance within the continental US. Room hasa TV with number of US channels including HBO and Starz.To SUM UP, this is a great hotel with good service. I wouldrate it 3.5 stars. With minimal renovations to rooms, itcould upgrade to 4 stars easily."
209,2153,"May 25 2006	Very Friendly Staff	We stayed in this hotel for four nights in early May for a wine-country vacation. We knew ahead of time that the parking was going to be $45 per day, so we were prepared for the cost involved. We knew that San Francisco is made up of several one-way streets, so it was not hard to navigate our way around to the vehicle entrance. (hint: if you pull up to the front of the hotel on 4th, the bellman will give you a piece of paper with instructions on what streets to take and what direction to turn to take you around to the valet entrance). The bathroom was typical, but the Kohler shower head was amazing! I've never been so impressed with a hotel shower in my life! My only complaint was that housekeeping came early every day. We are not early risers (even on vacation) and housekeeping was knocking on our door at about 9am each day. I had to ask them to please come back later EVERY day. The best experience of all, however, was the staff in the lobby and at the front desk. There was a delightful gentleman, average height with a bald head that stood in the lobby, and each morning as we were leaving he would greet us, and each evening when we returned he asked us how our day was...where did we eat for lunch, etc. After the second day he recognized us and made a point to say hello. Also fabulous was the gentleman behind the front desk with an exceptional taste in ties. He had a great colorful tie on each day, and when we checked in he was fantastic."
210,2153,"May 1 2006	Clean and quiet	We stayed 2 days after arrival from an overseas flight and asked for a quiet room to recover from jet lag. The receptionist gave us a a nice corner room with no neighbours and we could recover properly. The room was very clean and comfortable. The view was not breathtaing but O.K.If you look for a great view go to the bar on top of the hotel, grab yourself a beer and enjoy sunset."
211,2153,Apr 30 2006 	Great Hotel	All staff was friendly and accomodating. Great corner room on the 24th floor. Roomy and very clean. Within walking distance of many locations and public transportation. This was my 2nd visit to SF and I enjoyed this hotel much better than the Fairmont.
212,2153,"Apr 28 2006 	Overall a good hotel	Marriott San Francisco (on Market Street) April 2006This hotel is quite nice. It's a convention hotel so you get what comes with that: a huge impersonal lobby, hordes of people going/coming from the convention, and so on. Location is in the middle of the shops on Market Place, right near a BART station, a nice walk down to the Embarcadero. Parking at hotel is very expensive but there are nearby municipal lots for about $22 per 24-hours (no in/out privileges). If you can, park at one of the east-bay BART stations ($5 per 24 hour period but reservations for long-term parking need to be made in advance; instructions at the BART website) and ride BART in. Pretty much anything you could want is near-by: drug store, office depot, radio shack, all the shops you'd find in a mall, cafes, restaurants (from cheap to expensive), a copy place just a block or two away on Market Street with fairly cheap internet access (10 cents/minute with $1.50 minimum charge - hotel internet is $13 per 24 hour period (noon to noon, I believe), or, at the business center (limited hours), $4 for 15 minutes). We couldn't find an internet cafe nearby.The reception staff were quite competent; I checked in before the &quot;rush&quot; so there wasn't much of a wait. I requested a later check-out which was granted so check-out didn't involve a wait, either. I requested that no newspapers be delivered but USA Today was delivered anyhow. When I checked out, I left my luggage at the luggage check. Luggage drop-off was quite quick, but luggage pick-up involved a long wait. To add insult to injury, there were a number of us in line, but when the employee came back from retrieving someone else's items, he went to a businessman who had just arrived and who was standing on the other side of the podium, well outside the line, and helped him before helping those of us who were standing in line. Needless to say, I didn't give him the tip I had prepared.The rooms were acceptable. Clean, recently renovated, but impersonal. The hotel has gone to duvets which I wholly approve of, and beds have a nice selection of pillows (4) of varying firmness. No mini-bar in the room (I usually store my drinks in the refrigerator), so I requested a refrigerator be delivered, which was quite loud and ugly. The bed was fairly comfortable - a bit soft for my liking - I didn't tear the bed apart but the mattress was either a pillow top mattress or had a feather bed under the sheet. Bathroom floors were marble tile which was quite a nice touch and the vanity was wooden with built-in shelves for the towels. The office chair at the desk was a little ratty. There was no fan in the bathroom although ventilation seemed fairly strong (but no way to turn it off if you wanted to steam up the bathroom to remove wrinkles from clothes).I asked for a room in the highest tower as I had read that rooms closest to the street could be noisy. Street noise was not a problem if the windows were closed. I also asked for a room well away from elevators, ice machines, traffic, etc. and did not have any problems with hallway noise. I was on the 24th floor on the St. Patrick's Cathedral side (&quot;city&quot; view) which had as good a view as any of the higher floors as surrounding buildings were high enough to block the view from them as well as from the 24th floor.The room overall was quite clean although it was clear under the bed had not been vacuumed in quite some time, which is really surprising seeing as it shouldn't take much time at all to run a vacuum under the bed (assuming the Marriott has purchased vacuums which fit under the bed - if they haven't, that is pretty stupid). Marriott's policy is to NOT change bedsheets for guests staying multiple nights unless a card is placed on the bed - I highly approve of this policy as it's much better for the environment. In addition to the Gideon Bible, the Marriott is providing the Book of Mormon. In my opinion, all religious material should be removed from the rooms and only delivered upon guest request.The room had a hair dryer which almost burst into flames the first time I tried using it. It kept dying and I thought it was a problem with the outlet, but then a bit of smoke started coming out of the exhaust vent and I quickly unplugged it. It was replaced in about 15 minutes by housekeeping by the same model which worked fine. Marriott probably buys extremely cheap hair dryers (who can blame them as people are probably careless with them) which eventually short out as mine did.The best part of the hotel was the fitness center. There was no additional charge for using the equipment, although use of the shower room/locker involved a $5 additional charge. There was quite a range of machines to use and an adequate number. The pool was small - not good for lap swimming, although the hot tub was huge. I don't trust the cleanliness of hotel pools/hot tubs (due to all the kids) so did not use them. In the reception area of the fitness center, they had ice water with lime or lemon, plus a variety of fruits (apples, bananas, oranges) and plenty of towels. Other hotels I have stayed at have charged to used fitness centers that are this nice. The tread mills and recumbent bikes are hooked up to the hotel's cable, although you do need to bring your own headphones.The concierge line was quite long every time I passed by; the one night when we wanted information and were in line, the bellboy came over and offered to help. We wanted information about the Mission District: best burrito place and help finding an ice cream place I had been to before but didn't recall the name of. He was quite helpful: he knew the ice cream place and provided directions but couldn't recall the name (we found it and it's called Bombay - I strongly recommend it although it closes relatively early), and sent us to Pancho Villa for burritos which had fantastic and cheap burritos. I think we got better information from him than we would have from the concierge, who was probably used to sending guests to far pricier restaurants. The bellboy, in contrast, lived in the Mission District.I had previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square and thought it was nice, but the Marriott's fitness center and somewhat better location make it the better hotel, in my opinion. The Hyatt's top-floor bar is nice (but pricey); the Marriott is supposed to have a nice view from their top-floor bar, but I never made it up there."
213,2153,"Apr 18 2006	Outstanding	Location is perfect if you're in town for all the traditional sights: Everything from 24-hour diners to world-class shopping is within easy walking distance, and transport to more distant attractions is a snap. Service personnel were exceptionally helpful and courteous (but never instrusive); rooms were spotless and well-insulated from external noise, and on-site facilities were first class. Unlike so many other establishments of its caliber (and there are quite a few in SFO), a four-star property that actually delivers on every promise. Highly recommended."
214,2153,"Apr 7 2006 	Be Careful When Booking this Hotel!	I stayed at the Marriott SF on April 5, and the first minute I arrived, the problems started. First the entrance to the hotel is NOT the hotel address. It's about 4 blocks via one way streets. I missed a turn and spent 10 minutes getting back to the entrance. The parking was an astronomic $45 a day! I am a Marriott rewards member, so I was confident I would get a nice room on a high floor. When I walked in to my 35th floor room, I found that I had a great view of the air conditioner units. I immediately called the front desk, and was politely told I could have a 4th floor room instead. When I complained to the manager, she gave me a 14th floor room, overlooking piles of garbage on the roof of the hotel's other wing. It was terrible! The room itself was OK, especially the bathroom, but the high speed internet costs another $13 a day. This hotel is dedicated to taking your money as efficently as possible. In conclusion, I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star, and I give the management a resounding &quot;F&quot; as in extremely poor. I will not stay at this Marriott again."
215,2153,Mar 22 2006	Excellent 	I stayed in Marriott on Fourth Street during the weekend of the NIKE Womens Marathon. The room was magnificant and VERY clean! The view of San Francisco from the hotel room was incredible. The upstairs bar/lounge/restaurant was a nice with a relaxing atmosphere. The staff was friendly and willing to assist with any questions or concerns. The breakfast buffet was a little pricey but well worth the cost. It is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco with Trolley and Cable Car service easliy accessible. Very nice hotel!! Definately a place to stay!!
216,2153,"Mar 17 2006 	Great Hotel	I just got back from staying at this hotel. Overall it was a very pleasurable experience. The room was very comfortable and user friendly for a business traveler. They did not charge for using the gym, which many hotels do. Finally, the breakfast in thier Terrace restaurant was surprisingly good. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you are staying near the convention center or Union Square."
217,2153,"Mar 1 2006 	Great Location	The location of the hotel was excellent. Walking distance to Union Square, Sears Restaurant on Powell (great breakfast), San Francisco Mall, Crate&amp;Barrel, H&amp;M, Anthropologies, William Sonoma, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Metronome, Moscone Ctr. etc.... It was also very close to the cable car and BART. The rooms were very clean and the size just enough room for two. I was disappointed that they did not have a coffee machine to make a cup when I get up or even making hot water for tea in the evening or a small mini bar. They do have a coffee kiosk downstairs in the lobby but there was a long line with only one person working there. I preferred to go to Coffee Bean for coffee around the corner on Market Street for its mocha ice blended coffee. We rented a car for couple of days and found the overnight parking was extremely high of $45.00 and you had to have it valet parked so by the time you add the tax and tip try dishing out $50.00 (that's more than the rented car per day) I found a public parking on 5th and Mission across kiddie corner from the hotel which was $22.00 for 24 hours.  I noticed on the floor where we stayed the room service tray was not picked up right away and were sitting out all day.  The water pipe made loud noises when the neighboring guest were using the bathroom. Going to and from our rooms were great with the low, mid and high rise elevators. We didn't have to wait for the elevators at all and stopped on every floor.I love staying at the Marriott Hotels and I guess I am spoiled staying at the Marriott Resort Hotels in San Diego and Monterey Bay which were excellent hotels with all the ammenities."
218,2153,"Feb 22 2006 	First Class!	Attended a real estate convention so elected to stay on-site.A first class hotel in every regard. Expensive, yes but you get what you pay for. Had stayed at Hotel Rex the prior weekend, rated #6 when I last looked), and that was excellent too but in a different way. See my review. Horses for courses so to speak. If I was visiting San Francisco again and wanted a full-service top end hotel would definetly consider this Marriott."
219,2153,"Feb 19 2006	Lovely hotel	We stayed in the San Francisco Marriott for a long weekend in December 2005. The hotel was well located, only minutes walk from most of the attractions, and in very easy reach of the convenient public transport system.The staff at the hotel were always helpful and friendly, and knowledgeable about the local area. The staff offered help without having to be asked, for example, providing umbrellas on wet days.Food in the hotel was good and varied, between upmarket restaurants, through the sports bar, to the coffee facilities.I would definitely stay in the hotel again if I was in the area."
220,2153,Feb 16 2006	Central Location Good Standard	We stayed at the Marriott for 4 nights at the end of January. The hotel is very well located within walking distance to the cable car turnaround and good shopping like the Virgin Megastore. The rooms were a very good size and very clean. The beds were fantastic and just what you needed after walking around all day. The only problem we had was the church bells ringing every morning waking us up but we were jet lagged anyway. We ate at the lobby restaurant and it was very nice with a piano player. This hotel is a very big convention hotel and is not for those looking for an intimate get away in a boutique hotel. Another plus for us was that we were renting a hertz car and they had a station in the lobby. The parking was expensive but then who in their right mind would want to drive around San Francisco when the public transport is so good. All in all we were very happy with our stay and had a great time.
221,2153,"Jan 23 2006	Not Bad Great Location	Nice hotel in a great location -- downtown and near many things to see and do. My husband and I stayed for one night and were disappointed that the View Bar was closed for renovations. The limited contact with the staff was good. The rooms were small - but typical by San Francisco standards. While the bed was quite comfortable and the room was clean, the room seemed a bit in need of an update (particularly compared to the Park Hyatt where we stayed several months earlier for close the same price.) Valet parking is a whopping $45 (but you're paying for convenience.) While I wouldn't pay the rack rate for this hotel, not a bad place to stay in the heart of San Francisco."
222,2153,"Jan 15 2006	Loved the Marriot	We stayed in Mariott for 5 days with two small children and it was excellent! Good, clean room with a beautiful view and good service. Great breakfast-buffet with friendly people. We loved to have a drink in the view-lounge at the 39th floor."
223,2153,"Jan 12 2006	Great Location	Was only in San Francisco for 2 nights so did not spend much time in the hotel - and when in such a hurry to see as much as possible it's great to stay in such an ideal location. It's very close to transport links, and the city centre.As a further note, when I went on to Las Vegas after staying here I realised I had left my mobile phone charger in the hotel room. One phone call and they had it sent on to my Vegas Hotel right away."
224,2153,"Jan 9 2006	Nickel and Dime Me	This hotel has a gorgeous lobby and nice rooms. However, one gets the feeling they are trying to squeeze nickels and dimes out of their guests. There is no coffee pot in the room, so the only alternative for the early morning cup is to go downstairs to their expensive Starbucks coffee kiosk (and to add insult to injury, I happen to dislike Starbucks). If you want a cup before 6:30 a.m., you're just plain out of luck--other than room service--as the kiosk is not open yet. This is extremely inconvient, and although it may sound small, it really diminished the experience for us. There is no honor bar. There are no robes. All very odd for a 4-star hotel. It's those extra little touches that make the difference, and this hotel apparently isn't interested in that. In my view, the devil is in the details. I wouldn't go back."
225,2153,"Jan 4 2006	It's the location!	We stayed here as part of a special christmas present for my three teenaged daughters. Here are some of the pluses. If you check the Marriott website they have specials which include parking in the hotel room costs (a $40 a day savings!). The room was nice, only a partial view but the beds were lovely and the bathroom was clean. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We live in the bay area and I wanted to stay close to the curran theatre and A.C.T. (both a easy walk). The girls loved being near union square (sephora, h&amp;m, DSW, urban outfitters, macy's, betsey johnson - you get the idea). I'd recommend the hotel to anyone coming to the city for theatre or shopping, you are close to the meteron and to muni/cable cars/bart. In the past we've stayed at hotels in union square (st francis, etc.) but the marriott room was a great deal for the money and still close to everything. I'd recommend eating at one of the hundreds of great restaurants in the city and just having coffee or drinks at the hotel (the view bar is lovely). We will probably stay here on our next after-christmas fiesta!"
226,2153,"Dec 23 2005	Terrific Hotel	Stayed for a night to do some shopping in San Francisco. The hotel was not crowded during Christmas week and we were able to check-in at 10a.m. The Front Office Manager was at the front desk and when we asked for a non-connecting room, he personally picked out a good one for us. Room 2640 was a corner room with a great view of Yerba Buena Gardens and Moscone Center. It was an oversized, nicely decorated room and had an extremely comfortable bed. The location was terriic, just 1/2 block from 4th and Market Streets (Nordstrom, Bloomingdales next year)and two blocks from Union Square and the major shopping area (Macy's, Saks, Beiman Marcus, etc). I highly recommend this hotel. If you do have a car, park in the 5th and Mission Garage across the street for $22 a day vs. $49 at the hotel."
227,2153,"Dec 9 2005 	Excellent Location Otherwise just OK	I stayed in this hotel on several occasions (from seminars to just a weekend in SF for fun) - the location of the hotel is great, just couldn't be better. You're walking distance to Union Square, a lot of downtown stores and restaurants, BART (which incidently takes you straight to SFO), Metrion, etc.; As far as food, we found it to be average, a bit overpriced (for a plain meal of steak &amp; mashed potatoes or basic breakfast items), there're much better dining establishments in SF, so dinner at the Marriott is not worth your time; The rooms were a bit old, but overall quite large and comfortable, everything was in working order and functional; the showers were a bit small, but clean and in working order. If you'r in town for a few days I would certainly recommend this hotel (much better then other Marriott properties in the city), it could get a bit pricey, but you're getting quality for your $$..if you want true luxury, opt for the brand new St Regis, Fairmont, PanPacific, etc."
228,2153,"Nov 14 2005	Best hotel in town !!	My partner and I spent a week in San Fran at the Marriott, I have stayed in the city many times before at the Hilton, Crowne Plaza, The Mosser to name a few, but this really is the best hotel experience in town and centrally located, just a stone's throw from Union Square. Extremely courteous staff from the moment you check-in, very welcoming after a long and eventful flight from the UK (with emergency landing in Iceland!). We were upgraded to a suite with excellent city view and very well appointed accommodation for such a HUGE hotel. Very comfortable beds, sofas, spotless bathroom and very attentive housekeeping staff. Top floor bar has awesome city views and worth the trip in the elevator although the drink prices are steep. Shops shops and more shops, if you want a well-located venue for a city stay and indulge in retail therapy, this is the hotel for you. Also convenient for Market Street, the trolley to Fisherman's Wharf or towards Embarcadero, the nightlife of SoMa and nowhere that far by taxi - and no fewer than 4 Starbucks in short walking distance, including one in the lobby! There is a huge multistory carpark just across the road for those with rental vehicles and excellent dining spots all around - we liked the 24hr Mason Cafe on Mason St, 5 mins walk from the hotel and also Cheesecake Factory atop Macy's Union Square. We will definitely be returning to the Marriott for our next stay in San Francisco :-)"
229,2153,"Nov 11 2005	Wonderful Hotel Great location	My 13-year old daughter and I spent several nights in San Francisco. I decided to spend a few nights in different hotels to get a different perspective of the city. We stayed in the San Francisco Marriott on a Saturday night as I found a great rate through AAA. From the moment we drove to the front entrance, we experienced great service. Check-in was pleasant and easy, as they allowed an early check-in of 1 p.m. We requested a high-level room, away from the church as an earlier reviewer advised. I also advise staying in a room away from the church, as the bells are amazingly loud! We had a very quiet room, but the elevators could be heard zipping up and down until about midnight and resumed at about 6 a.m. It wasn't terribly loud, but it could be heard. This hotel has an amazing gym- three different work-out rooms. We were quite pleased, and they were open 24-hours a day! The only thing I found strange, was the fact that the room did not have a coffee maker or a mini-bar. It did not pose a problem, as a vending machine was on every floor, and room service was reasonably priced and extremely quick. The hotel was located near Union Square and SoMa. It was an easy walk to Chinatown(my daughter's favorite part of the trip.) I recommend visiting the chinese bakery on Grant Street as they serve freah-out of the oven rolls, almond cookies and various other traditional pasteries. We waited in a long line that stretched out down the block, but it was worth it! We also ate at a Chinese restaurant near the bakery that was delicious- but the service was terrible. We were defintiely being ignored for some reason, but the fresh dumplings and spring rolls were quite good. This hotel is also right near the Powell Street BART."
230,2153,"Nov 10 2005	Honeymoon Bliss	My fiancee and I decided to get married at City Hall in our favorite city in the world - San Francisco. Our stay at the SF Marriott proved to be a perfect decision as the location and staff were all top-rate. The room was spacious, the bed complete with down comforter so comfortable we'd like to buy it and the view from our corner room was spectacular both day and night. In particular, the concierge - Jeff Clavin, went above and beyond to make sure our honeymoon was perfect. He arranged for a florist to deliver my bouquet, sent champagne and chocolates on his own accord as a surprise to our room on our wedding day and suggested restaurants we might enjoy for a special night out. Even the maid service respected our privacy and ensured we would be left alone unless needed. The entire staff heard about our upcoming wedding and we received congratulations from employees we hadn't even met. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it."
231,2153,"Nov 8 2005 	I left my heart in San Francisco at the Marriott	I travel to San Francisco two or three times each year on business. The Marriott has become my favorite place to stay. The rooms and hallways have been recently renovated and they are magnificant for a &quot;chain&quot; hotel. The beds are comfortable, the rooms and bathrooms are clean, and the staff is first-rate. The pool and Fitness Center is fantastic.The lounge on the 39th Floor gives a beautiful view of the entire Bay area, and is unlike any other that I have visited since Windows on the World in New York. They have a wonderful wine selection, and a wait staff that remembers you (not sure if that is a good thing or not). It makes business travel a pleasure to have a place like this to visit.The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect as you are close to great restaurants (Lu Lu's is HIGHLY recommended...two blocks away), the Moscone Center and China Town.I highly recommend this hotel to ANYONE...it will meet all tastes and styles."
232,2153,"Oct 6 2005	Excellent Hotel	Stayed for three nights and couldn't have been happier. The staff were very kind and helpful from the moment we walked in. Rooms were larger than typical SF hotels, and slept soundly every night. Close to cable car, and muni busses, plus mega shopping. We were on the 29th floor with a nice view, and very pleased with our room."
233,2153,Sep 26 2005	Excellent Service and Nice Rooms	Staff was SO helpful and nice. We had a pleasant experience. Rooms were nice and atmosphere was comfortable. The only thing I wasn't completely satisfied with was the bed. Since I am use to sleeping on a pretty firm mattress at home this bed was not comfortable because it wasn't firm.
234,2153,"Sep 19 2005 	A conventioneer's delight	Third stay her, each time for a few days, well managed, rooms larger and nicely furnished, better and bigger bathrooms than average, not intimate or boutique or romantic but a solid choice and convenient to everything including great shopping and restaurants,also excellent for BART transport, but try the Palace and the Argent in the same area if you want less of a &quot;chain&quot; choice, excellent concierge desk people, couples and singles could feel pushed out by the convention crowds but a good choice overall."
235,2153,"Aug 30 2005	Close to Union Square	We needed a getaway for one night, and got a deal on this through Priceline. We usually stay on Union Square, but this was only 2 blocks from there and the cable cars, and around the corner from Nordstroms. We wanted an early check in, and got it. Our room was very comfortable and clean, with not much of a view, but for one night, we weren't in it long enough to care. My husband avoided their parking fee of $46, and used the public lot at 5th and Mission for $22. There are no in and out priveleges, but once parked, we walked or rode the cable cars. We would probably stay here again."
236,2153,"Aug 30 2005	Easy In and Out	I stayed with my family for three nights and we loved the service. We arrived at the valet parking and were promptly met, our luggage was taken by a porter and we were escorted to the front desk and then to our room. A very nice start to our stay. The room was large and comfortable. I found the restaurant had a good menu selection and the waitstaff were attentive. I was on the east side of the building on the 9th floor which faced St. Mary's church. The first morning we all scrambled out of bed at 7:30 when the church bells began to ring. If you like to sleep late, do not have a view of the church. My ears are still ringing. I will warn you too about the valet parking. At peak times you may find yourself waiting 20 or 30 minutes to enter the hotel. But anytime you are traveling in SF, it is better to leave the car at home."
237,2153,Aug 23 2005 	Great Hotel	Stayed here on business in the beginning of August 2005 and had a fabulous time. Friendly staff and a great location. Nice sized room and comfy bed. Would definitely recommend.
238,2153,Aug 21 2005	Excellent Hotel	We spent a long time trying to find a decent hotel at the right price in SF. Eventually we settled on The Marriott and were not disappointed. The rooms were of ample size although I would suggest asking for high rise room. The indoor pool was a good size and nice and warm although we could find no changing rooms. On our last day we experienced a very enjoyable breakfast in the hotel. Yes it is a little expensive but is well worth it. If you do not require in house breakfast there are a couple of diners round the corner especially Loris and Dennys. Next to the hotel is a large multiscreen cinema and Sony centre which if you have teenagers with you they will thoroughly enjoy. Union Square is a 5 minute walk away and there are many shops in close proximity. The Tram buses to Fishermans Wharf are 2 minutes away and the cable cars are about 5 minutes. A word of caution was that there was no internet computer in the lobby therefore we had to hunt for an internet cafe which was 10 to 15 mins away. At night it can be easy to get lost and as you move away from the centre the area becomes a little dangerous to be around. Several people had mentioned this to us and during our stay in California we found more beggars on SF than any we visited. In summary the hotel was excellent with great views from the top floor at night. We spent 4 nights there and would certainly return to visit a number of places we ran out of time to see.
239,2153,"Aug 19 2005	Perfect Location	We enjoyed our stay at the Marriott. The concierge staff was very friendly and helpful with questions about how to use transportation, etc. It seemed we were just a few steps away from any of the transportation options we needed. The room was comfortable, especially thanks to the down comforter and thermostat in the room. The View Lounge has really nice views of the city."
240,2153,"Aug 8 2005	Great Renovation	The SF Downtown Marriott was changed for the better. Newly remodeled, and quite comfortable. My husband and I were &quot;walked&quot; to this property after being told that the Renaissance Stanford Court was overbooked for the night. We were furious and had little confidence that the downtown Marriott would suit our needs as I did not remember it for being a tourist friendly property. We were proven wrong right away. The hotel is surprisingly quiet, roomy, and very comfortable. I would highly recommend for future stays."
241,2153,"Aug 2 2005	Excellent if it was not for the parking	Like the previous writer I found the parking charges outrageous. Luckily I had read about this on trip advisor before we left. We parked at the fifth and mission garage, it is on the opposite corner - enter on mission between fifth and fourth from the direction of fifth. It is only $22 per day with no in and out privileges. It is a city parking garage, you can find details of all of the city garages on the city website. We were passing through so we needed the car, but you really do not need a car in sf, the public transport is good and you can buy a muni pass for one, three or five days. As for the hotel, I thought it was great. Our room was a decent size, looked newly refurbished and was immaculately clean. It had everything we needed. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning which was good but a bit steep at $18 each. The main thing about the hotel is that is central, just off market and two minutes from union square, so that everything is really is easy to access. I am sure you could probably get good deals on other sites but we booked on marriott.com and paid $119 per night and thought we got value for money.The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful; in particular two of the concierge staff who helped us get set up with city tours. If you want to go to Alcatraz book before you leave. I tried to but there was a problem with the booking system. When I got there all the tickets were booked and we missed out. We could have stood in the standby queue but I heard that you can stand for up to seven hours."
242,2153,"Aug 1 2005	Big hotel but personal service	At first sight, this hotel seems like another big convention hotel (and there were several conventions there during our stay). But the service is very personal - all the staff are very friendly (special mention for Margaret at the concierge desk - great tour and restaurant recommendations, and how did she remember my (full) name when she deals with hundreds of people each day??!!).The buffet breakfast is great if you can eat that much in the morning (if you can, it will keep you going until dinner); if not, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. We had a room on the 28th floor with great views of Twin Peaks. The room itself was very large, very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located more or less at the junction of Stockton (leading to Union Square) and Market (a major (the main?) shopping street), so we had no complaints about location. Overall, 10 out of 10."
243,2153,Jul 30 2005 	Don't park here	Don't park your car at the hotel because they charge $46.00/day to park your car. And you have no in or out ability. That's outrageous!!
