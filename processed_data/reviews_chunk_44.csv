142,1038,"Jan 3 2008 	Park Plaza?? Impressed.	My wife and I recently came up to London for the night to see Swimming with Sharks, starring Christian Slater, which was absolutely brilliant in case anyone is thinking of going. So we decided that rather than try to get a late train home, we would stay in a hotel for the night.The hotel we tried was called the Riverbank Park Plaza. The Park Plaza chain we have tried before and were quite impressed, so we hoped it would be as good if not better.Upon arrival at the hotel, we were immediately impressed. It was in a lovely location overlooking the houses of parliament, Big Ben, and the River Thames.The Lobby was large and clean, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. After check in we were given the key to our room, and made our way up. As we entered the room, we were a little dismayed, as the bed was all messed up, and not made, and there were used glasses scattered around the bedside tables, as though the room was still occupied. We went back down and explained to the check in staff, and they could not be more apologetic, and sorted us out another room immediately, which thankfully this time was very nice.The rooms are spacious, and clean, and the bathroom is a very good size too. You have a t.v., internet access, and a dvd player in your room if you wish to use them.After we got back from the show that night, we decided to try the bar in the hotel as it looked lovely when we walked passed it upon arriving. The decor was beautifully done, and it had a very cosy feel to it, with a good variety of drinks on the menu. The only criticism I do have with it though, is that, as you would expect in London, the drinks were not cheap, but they also put on a service charge to bring your drinks over, which I feel is a little harsh considering that is actually there job anyway. However, that said, The bar was very pleasant.Check out could not have been easier really, and they were quite happy to let us leave out luggage at the hotel after check out, while we went shopping for a few hours, all of which was no extra charge.Overall I think the hotel was good, and I would recommend the Park Plaza chain, as this was our second successful one."
143,1038,"Jan 2 2008 	One of the best	I stayed at the Riverbank for New years Eve, and day. I would have loved to stay longer. As the branch Manager of a UK independant travel agency. I have become very critical over the years of some five star establishments. I have to say The Park Plaza Riverbank, it up there on my top lhotels list. This beautiful aprt hotel has a warm and welcoming feel. The staff warm and genuine. The rooms excellent. If I had a couple of extra days off work I would have stayed. In fact I came home and tried to rebook for the same dates this year. However the rates are not yet released, for this period.This five star establishment, would suit anyone looking to feel comfortable with, but have the five luxury. I have stayed at a couple of the Park Plaza hotels and too date not have let me down. Well Park Plaza for getting things rightShirley O'Connor"
144,1038,"Jan 1 2008 	Not a bad choice	Staff is nice and helpful, as they allowed me to check-in early at 7:00am. From the hotel lobby to the room, I can really rate the hotel's cleanliness as excellent. Room is at reasonable size, looked like newly decorated and, the most important thing, no bad smell 'coz many hotels in London are really old. Hotel is a little bit away from the tube station, but it's only less than 15 minutes walk from Vauxhall station, or a few bus stops ride from both Vauxhall or Waterloo station. For the breakfast, both continental and full English breakfast is available, but I would recommend the full English one, as having some hot things in the morning always makes a day much better. On my check-out, helpful staffs again, as I was allowed to check-out at 5:00pm. Given the reasonable price, modern lobby, clean room and nice breakfast, it would be a lovely choice for my next possible stay in London."
145,1038,"Dec 23 2007	nice hotel	Originally booked for Park Plaza County Hall which wasn't finished and transfered to this hotel. We got a good deal at County Hall which they honoured.After reading reviews on tripadvisor we were worried about getting a noisy room, so we emailed and asked for a quiet room, which we got ( We also got upgraded to an exec room, with a partial river view)The Hotel was in a good position, within easy walking distance of Vauxhall, and Westminster Bridge. It had a small convenience shop next door.The room was a good size, with a dvd player, and a good sized bathroom .There was no razor point in the bathroom, but housekeeping brought an adapter up for us.Staff were helpfulBreakfast was a buffet, and you had to ask for fried eggs, which were cooked to order. It was very nice."
146,1038,"Dec 15 2007 	Suprisingly good service/location	I've booked an overnight stay at Park Plaza Riverside and was very pleased with the service. I arrived with my partner and queried about overnight car park and this was dealt promptly.The check-in was pleasant and quick. The staff were very friendly and informative and we were upgraded to a 'riverside view' room for free but to be honest you would really have to look for that elusive river-view among the building/apartment opposite the window. Setting that aside, the room was very clean and modern. I was suprised to see the twin beds were placed side-by-side as to make a double bed (I was later told that this was a common practice) which made sleeping a bit uncomfortable.The hotel is a 5-min walk to Vauxhall Tube Station and you can also catch a bus just outside the hotel. There's also a service station down the road for snacks and drinks.Overall, I was very pleased with my visit and would stay there again next time I'm in London."
147,1038,Dec 12 2007	One of the best hotels i have stayed at!!	What a fantastic hotel!!I stay in hotels at least 3 days a week around the country every week and this hotel without doubt is in my top 3 of the best places i have stayed.The staff were exceptional and the room breathtaking. i was upgraded to a suite over looking the river. Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful!!!I really really recommend this hotel!!
148,1038,"Dec 8 2007	black mold found	My mother and I took our very first trip to London in September. Our second day there we both started getting sick with a fever. The third day I couldn't get out of bed and ended up going to St. Thomas emergency room where I was diagnosed with a severe case of sinunitis. I was put on antibiotics. My mom was still sick but wasn't seen the same night. We we returned to our room at the Park Plaza Riverbank I was looking to hang a shirt and that is when I saw it. Black mold over the shower. I had been going into the bathroom to steam it in an attempt to breathe better and it made things worst. I took some pictures and called the manager. He was extremely rude and didn't seem concerned. I had to fight him to get him to move us. We were in room 729. When he finally found a room he didn't call us, just sent someone up to move us. We hadn't even packed yet. The bellboy gave us 15mins. Once moved the manager never came to speak to me or to see the toxic mold in the bathroom. He was just going to use clorox, wipe it away, and put someone else in the room. I was outraged. My mother was finally seen on Saturday, 6 days later due to an increasing fever. She had a hard time walking, and it was clear there was fluid in her lungs yet the doctor in the ed never listened to her lungs, just gave her antibiotics. We returned to the States the next day and my mom saw her regular doctor. It turned out she had bacterial pneumonia and her doctor said it was caused from breathing in the toxic mold in our hotel room. Our trip was a nightmare and the Park Plaza Riverbank needs to be inspected by whatever agency looks into this sort of thing in the UK"
149,1038,"Dec 8 2007	Great Hotel	I loved this hotel! The location was great and the rooms were nicely equipped and very modern. The view wasn't so great-another hotel room, but it was just a short walk to Big Ben and Westminster Abby. We also went to the lounge one night which was very stylish."
150,1038,"Dec 6 2007 	All good for me...	I was put in this hotel when presenting at a conference and my employers never normally go four star, or whatever this is, so i was pretty impressed!THe hotel has a good location, as others have mentioned, although the walk from Vauxhall tube can be a little nervy for a lone female in the dark - the Thames Path not seeming that pleasant.Good check-in with polite staff, spacious room, really comfy bed with lovely cotton bedlinen. Swamky bathroom - but I too noticed you are unable to switch off the light, which seemed strange.My TV worked and I had an iron. Hairdryer was a bit dodgy though!Breakfast was fine, though they were a bit disorganised and when the lounge was full (at 7.30am) had to send other colleagues to the restaurant upstairs.I add to others' advice that if you are booking this yourself, ensure you request a room away from that railway line - unless you are a very heavy sleeper or planning on getting so drunk you won't notice!"
151,1038,"Nov 30 2007 	Good Location excellent standard of rooms	The hotel is in a great location and easy to get around by taxi, Harrods about 8 one way. Not far from the London Eye. The rooms were excellent, clean and comfortable although watch out for rooms looking out onto the railway track as you can hear the trains passing by. Breakfast was good was it worth the 25 for two, I would say if you can go out and explore there are places near by. There is a store a few meters from the front door offering snacks, drinks etc. worth going there rather than spend 2 on a cola from the mini bar.Would I stay here again, yes."
152,1038,"Nov 24 2007 	Noisy poor to negligent service overpriced - stay elsewhere !	I've had to stay at this hotel 5 times now, because it was the only one the travel agent could get me into in central London - and this despite the fact that after my first experience, I've always requested to go anywhere BUT the Riverside Plaza. I'm not usually the complaining sort, but after my first stay, last year, I complained about the lights in the room not working; there was no iron / ironing board in the room (there's supposed to be one in every room); I was ignored at breakfast and had to wait half an hour for a coffee; and the noise of the trains kept me awake half the night. None of the problems were fixed during my stay.On my next stay I was upgraded to an executive room. The decor was fine, but as I was getting changed for a shower, a maid entered the room and despite my protestations, wouldn't leave: she didn't appear to speak a word of English. In the end, I had to throw a towel at her to get her to leave. When I complained at Reception about someone bursting into my room and refusing to leave, I was told that it couldn't have been housekeeping because they finish at 6pm - and the incident had happened after 6pm. It never became clear why the maid was there - maybe she thought the room was empty... and my complaint was never answered, despite a promise that the Management would look into it for me.The next time seemed fine, until later in the day I came down with food poisoning and was off work for 3 days. The only place I had eaten on my own was at the breakfast buffet at this hotel.The time after that, I had to complain about a lack of iron and ironing board again (a recurring theme). The service was poor and - another recurring problem - it's impossible to turn off the bathroom light, which shines under the door and is very annoying.This last time, they upgraded me again. When I got to the room, there was a tray with dirty dishes and half-eaten food outside. I stepped over it to get into the room. When I left an hour later, it was still there and I had to ask at Reception for it to be taken away. The TV failed to work - I had to get someone from Reception to sort it out. There was no ironing board or iron in the room (again). At breakfast, I saw the waitress test the temperature of the food on display - this was at 7a.m. Her colleague (clearly a trainee) asked her how often the food was checked this way - she replied (within earshot) that she was supposed to check it at least twice, but was usually busy, so only bothered to check it once at the start of the shift. Given that the food is under &quot;heat&quot; lamps from 0700 to 1030, work it out for yourself. Each time I've sworn never to stay there again - this time I really mean it and if it means not going on a business trip to London, or staying in a nearby city instead, I'll willingly do it. The Riverside Park Plaza certainly does not get my vote. Spend your money elsewhere."
153,1038,"Nov 18 2007 	Handier location than might be thought...	As a hotel booking elsewhere got messed up an online search earned a bargain stop-over at this place. Albert Embankment doesn't immediately spring to mind but you'll have a good view down the Thames towards Parliament and the London Eye. Perfectly comfortable, well-appointed room and the bathroom was modern,clean and well-equipped. I had a room change yet in both rooms the TV did not work - and as the internet connection depended on the TV this was a bit annoying. Not least when you have a deadline. But the front desk and the maintenance guy were helpful and apologetic. Breakfast was surprisingly dire and is served in a basement &quot;Club lounge&quot; - not cheap if it is not included in your rate it might be best avoided and pickup a breakfast elsewhere. A good base for visitors, shoppers and business people you are a few minutes walk from Vauxhall underground and overground stations and so well-connected to London's public transport system. There is a 5th floor gym but given scale of the development a pool would have been welcome. Check with the front-desk re your room location : if you leave it to them not surprisingly you'll get a rear facing view and that's onto a railway line. There are good blackout curtains if you're sleeping late and on the whole noise insulation is good. Very helpful front desk."
154,1038,"Nov 12 2007	Both good and bad	No guarantee of not being at the back of the building (ie facing the rail tracks) unless prepared to pay 70 for an upgrade to an executive room - all other rooms face offices or similar at close proximity.The hotel seemed to be over heated, and in the room the air conditioning to cool the room was ineffective and noisy, while opening a window made train noise worse (is it safe to have a fully opening window on the 9th floor?). Not a very restful night's sleep.Breakfast was not ideal - queues to be seated, queues to get food. Staff had to be asked 4 times for tea and coffee. Cooked breakfast, although replenished regularly was cold and basic. I appreciate that they were busy (at 10.15am) - but while all other aspects of the public areas were superb this was a real let down in terms of quality and service.On the whole this is a modern, reasonably well located hotel (though a fair walk to any nightlife) with all mod cons - attractively designed and furnished with a great bar and restuarant. Fair warning of views and noise levels would be appreciated and someone really does need to address the breakfast situations on busy mornings."
155,1038,"Nov 8 2007 	Good hotel but be prepared to walk!	The instructions I received on booking this hotel suggested it was within walking distance of Vauxhall tube. This is true but it's a 15 minute walk and not that easy to find! I felt this was a little misleading. Anyway, we arrived early but our room was ready and we were allowed to check in.The hotel is very grand and impressive. We were dealt with by very friendly and helpful reception staff. We were in room 922 which was just a standard room rather than executive room but it was spacious by London standards, spotlessly clean with a nice big bed and good quality furniture. Definitely worthy of it's 4* rating. The only problem we experienced was the noise from the nearby lifts. This was a constant whirring that we eventually got used to but had we been staying for longer than 1 night I perhaps would've asked to move.In terms of location it felt like a very safe area to walk around at night and is fairly close to a lot of the main sightseeing attractions, which was good.I booked the room for only 80 at lastminute.com and would definitely consider staying again at that price but if I had to pay the hotels advertised rates I would look for somewhere closer to the tube."
156,1038,"Nov 7 2007 	We loved this hotel!	My husband and I stayed here for a Saturday night at the beginning of November 2007. I booked directly with the hotel and got a good rate. On arrival at Saturday tea time, we were sent to a second reception desk which deals with the club/residence and found we had been upgraded to an executive suite! Well, we entered the room and both just laughed! It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen - a massive bedroom with full length windows over looking the Thames, a fantastic bathroom with a shower big enough for about 6 people, a bath and loads of lovely toiletries. Also a fabby sitting area with tables, chairs, a desk area and again full sized windows. There was also a kitchen complete with a table, microwave, washing machine (!!), tea, coffee, complimentary water etc. We then found what we thought was a connecting door to the next room which had been left open - but no, this went through to a twin bedroom and another lovely bathroom - I began dreaming about how fab it would be to have enough money to live in this suite for a month or two! The bar is lovely - we got given a voucher for two complimentary drinks. We did not eat in the hotel, but walked along the south bank and ate in one of the restaurants just along past the London eye. It was a beautiful walk and we stopped at a bar on a boat along the way. Breakfast was taken in the executive lounge - the cold buffet was fine, but I did not touch the hot food - it did not look appealing and looked like it had been sitting there for ages. I felt sorry for the waitress who was continually on the 'phone to the kitchen asking for more hot food to be sent up. If I stayed again, I would eat breakfast in the restaurant. We got a complimentary paper delivered to our room and appreciated the late check out of midday as we chilled in the room for an hour or so after breakfast. I had no complaints about the location, but I love the south bank area. The hotel is about a 7 or so minute walk to Vauxhall tube - not hard to find at all. I would definitely stay here again - the staff were friendly, the suite fab too!"
157,1038,"Nov 5 2007 	Good mid-range hotel if a little variable	I've been staying at the Riverbank for quite some time with work and overall I have to say I'm pretty pleased. The rooms are a reasonable size, the beds are comfortable and food isn't bad either...I've also had a few mixed experiences with rooms, mixed-up reservations and mis-billings that prevent me from lavishing the highest praise on this hotel.The best advice I can give anyone checking into the Park Plaza is to ensure that you ask for a &quot;quiet location&quot; room as the rooms next to the railway are intolerably noisy, with trains running in and out of Waterloo every few minutes into the early hours.On the whole there are many worse places you could stay in London, and from this hotel the houses of Parliament, the London Eye and Waterloo Station are within walking distance."
158,1038,"Oct 24 2007 	Lovely hotelexcellent stay!!!	We got a great deal for the park Plaza Riverbank from lastminute.com for 79.We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and check in was smooth.The receptionist offered us the Executive package for only 35 and we got an Executive room with bathrobes,slippers,fruits,water and extra toiletries. We also had complimentry pre-dinner drinks in the executive Lounge.We had dinner in the Chino Latino restaurant which was delicious.I must say everyone we dealt with was very welcoming, friendly and professional.Our room was clean and spacious. We had an excellent stay and i would recommend the park Plaza Riverbank to all my friends and family and I will definitely visit the hotel next time I'm in London as well."
159,1038,"Oct 11 2007 	No Hot Water	I would not recommend this hotel.On arrival I was upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite. The room offered no privacy as an office building overlooked it. When you looked to the left there was a view of a railway line that was noisy whilst the trains were running which seemed to be all night. If you craned your neck to the right you could see the Thames. The room itself was clean and modern. At 9am I attempted to have a shower but was unable to get any hot water. The front desk advised they had had a problem with the boiler overnight but it had been fixed. It was suggested if I had to go to work I should go, otherwise I could try later as it would take time for the hot water to get up to the 8th floor. At the time of check out there was still no hot water. The front desk kindly offered to waive all charges I had incurred. I had not incurred any charges and they were then unable to explain how the charges had been booked to my room.The hotel is close to St Thomas hospital and nothing else, there are no pubs or restaurants nearby. The nearest tube stop should not be considered within walking distance nor is it anywhere that somebody who is staying at a 5 star hotel would wish to go."
160,1038,"Oct 3 2007	Time to unwind after a busy day in London	After arriving in London early morning struggling with Luggage we made our way to the hotel, to be greeted by the the the door man we were able to leave our luggage at ten o`clock. The hotel front of house staff were very helpfull and friendly. The appearance of the hotel was excellent. When wanting assistance with travell the concierge staff were very knowledgeable advising on the best form of transport to use and were able to tell you the sites in London. The rooms were comfortable and room service was always on hand. The most outstanding thing for us was the bar and restaurant. The atmosphere was realaxing in the bar. The restuarant was something to experience, hard to describe the word which comes to our minds is &quot; OUTSTANDING&quot;. We were not sure what to order, the staff explained everything we needed to know, able to tell us what was in each dish. We were not rushed in any way but services was on hand when needed. The wine waiter was very knowledgeable. We enjoyed our stay and will return.Jay and Amanda Drake"
161,1038,"Sep 23 2007 	They Need to Get Their Act Together	The hotel is well located along the Thames however getting to either tube station  Vauxhall or Waterloo  is a bit of a hike, about a ten minute walk. If it is raining heavily you might consider a taxi especially if you have luggage at the time. I attended the hotel because of a conference being held at the hotel. Check in and check out was efficient, although check in was a bit slow, but I had a trainee (said so on her name tag). The room and bathroom were in good shape and clean. Daily room service was spotty. Sometimes all toiletries were replaced in the bathroom, sometimes not. Breakfast included in my room rate was OK with hot and cold foods. However, the restaurant staff rushed me out and discouraged second helpings by almost immediately removing your plate and utensils after taking my last bite. One time I went back for seconds and received the evil eye from the staff.The hotel restaurant, Chino Latino, was excellent. Very good service and food.Apparently the building had problems with the exterior ceiling. The front entrance was closed mist of the time, causing guests to make a circuitous exit and entrance to the hotel. The blocked front entrance was not well marked.Business services were abominable. Voice mail in the rooms did not work. When I called the front desk to advise them of this, they only responded by saying they would send the concierge to my room to pass a handwritten note to a colleague in another room. I paid for wireless Internet access and hardly ever got a connection. Even the hotel staff tried to make the connection work on my laptop, but could not. The explanation was that the hotel was so full that their Internet system could not handle the Internet traffic. I think they were correct because twice I was able to get a brief Internet connection at 1am. In todays world, that response is unacceptable. As a (good) response to my problem, the hotel gave me free access to the business center computers and recharged my Internet access for an additional 24 hours. I am not sure I would stay here again unless the hotels business services are brought up to the 21st century. By the way, the hotel was opened only two years ago."
162,1038,"Sep 17 2007 	Modern stylish hotel with friendly staff	We booked this hotel based on reviews from this site and its location. We were going to London to see Brian Wilson at the Royal Festival Hall - the concert was fantastic and being just a short stroll from the hotel was great. Prior to check-in I had requested a quiet room, having read some of the reviews about the rooms at the back of the hotel being noisy due to the railway line. The day before we went I called the hotel to enquire whether they have any smoking rooms, which they do. So we were allocated a quiet smoking room and were very happy - there was even a partial river view. On arrival we requested a late check out and that was also 'no problem'.The Riverbank Park Plaza is extremely smart and modern and we found all the staff very friendly and helpful. We booked the online Executive package which gives you an Exec room (obviously!) and extras such as fruit, mineral water, bathrobes, slippers, extra toiletries etc and the use of the Executive Lounge on the 11th floor. The lounge serves hot drinks 24 hours a day and between 6-8pm there's free wine/beer and soft drinks plus crudits and snacks such as hummus, guacamole and dim sum. There's also breakfast served in there although we ate in the main restaurant and there was a good choice although no Eggs Benedict sadly.We had room service as we needed to eat early whilst getting ready so we ordered pizza and garlic bread. Not at all classy! They arrived late but were hot, fresh and tasty. The garlic bread (which was delicious but we like it strong and it certainly was!) arrived 10 minutes later with a genuine apology and I don't think we weren't charged for it. Also, having stayed in many London hotels with work, the prices on the room service menu were very reasonable. I can highly recommend the cocktails although at 7.50/9.50 each they aren't cheap. Luckily we got a scratch card on check-in and both won a freebie (although I suspect 'everyone's a winner'). I enjoyed a Raspberry &amp; Mint Margarita (delicious) and my fianc had a Dusty Mexican (tequila with Mexican orange liqueur and dark chocolate). If like us, you usually opt for a cheaper hotel in London but fancy splashing out and treating yourself, I would definitely recommend the Riverbank Park Plaza. It may be a little out of the way for some but we loved being by the Thames."
163,1038,"Sep 16 2007 	Trains keep you from sleeping	I booked this hotel through Trafalgar Tours to extend my stay in the UK after completing one of their tours.For the rate of $395 Australian Dollars per night I assumed I would be treating myself to something special.Obviously not everyone is going to be lucky enough to get the Thames river views of the House of Parliament but what they don't mention anywhere on the Park Plaza website is that the rooms on the left hand side of the building are 15 metres from the main railway track.Trains rumble by every other minute and you can feel the vibrations as well as hear them.In a premium hotel I've also become acustomed to the broadband internet being free, the company website touts the availability of the broadband but doesn't mention it will cost 9.95 pound per day. I didn't even have to pay that much in Moscow one of the most expensive cities in the world.It is also quite surprising that the bathroom has only shower facilities, no bath."
164,1038,"Sep 10 2007	Loved the park plaza	We booked this hotel as a Travelzoo promotion, upgraded to Executive package and would thoroughly recommend it. Previous posts suggested that it is out of town but we found the short walk along the Embankment to Westminster only took a few minutes and in fact didn't use the tube all weekend. It was easy to drive to and the car was speedily valet parked if a little expensive at 26 a night. Room was great although the river view was a little exaggerated (on tiptoe peering sideways). We used the Exec. lounge for drinks and nibbles(very limited) and used the 50% off voucher to eat in Chino Latino in the evening. Only disappointment was the toiletries - no conditioner! In all a lovely stay and would use this hotel again."
165,1038,"Sep 8 2007	Amazing view overlooking Thames Parliament Big Ben London Eye.....	Stayed here twice in August. First for 2 nights, then did some traveling to Oxford and Bath, then came back for 4 more nights.If it had been any sort of bad experience, I would have cancelled my second stay. I had enquired about airport pick-up service and the concierges were very helpful in describing all of the various alternative means of airport transportation and then making the arrangements when I had decided on car service. The driver (Bob) met us and was soooooo pleasant, informative, and interesting to talk to. (We requested him for our trip back to LHR at the end of our trip.) So, that was a very auspicious start because I was having doubts about taking the trip, what with the terrible exchange rate for the USD, the recent terrorism in the UK, and then the record floods in Oxford area. Being cheerfully welcomed by Bob, was a relief. Anyway, the bellmen at the hotel were very efficient at the hotel and check-in was easy, so we were in our room pretty quickly. The room we had was huge with a fantastic view. But I'm most picky about and what is most important to me is how CLEAN the room is. I was thrilled that it was very clean. So, two thumbs up from me on the cleanliness factor.What I liked was that the hotel was in a quiet area, but still really conveniently located. The public bus stop is literally outside the door. The Original London Sightseeing Bus stop is right at Lambeth Bridge, which is a couple of short blocks' walk. For the tube, I found that Vauxhall (on the Victoria Line) was a quick walk to/from the Park Plaza Riverbank, but when my son was tired, we took the bus for 1 stop directly back to the hotel. Better yet, right at the Vauxhall tube stop (which has a lot of buses, like a mini terminal), there was a Starbucks. Also, there is a very pleasant bus info center aboveground and then inside the tube station, the ubiquitous info window was always helpful. Next door to the hotel is a convenience store, a pub was a block away (didn't eat there, but it looked decent), and directly across the river was a Pizza Express restaurant. Had breakfast in the dining room. Some days it was a breakfast buffet and there was loads of variety and some days I ordered my entre off the menu. The host/manager who greeted me every day was always on the go, looking after everything and trying to make sure everyone was taken care of. I also had room service and besides being the usual expensiveness of room service, everything was fine and the food was delivered quickly and tasted fine.Every time we'd leave the hotel, we would see the doorman. He was omnipresent. He was always smiling. I would categorize him as &quot;jaunty&quot; in his purple uniform and top hat and quite &quot;Willy Wonka-ish&quot;---(the Johnny Depp one) --I mean this as a compliment! He was always there to hail a cab for us and to open the taxi door. I know there's plenty I'm forgetting to include, but these are the highlights.Oh, I know. My husband used the business centre and also the hi-speed internet access in the room. The in-room safe (big enough for his laptop and our other valuables) was useful, too.Bathroom was large. I would definitely stay here again.When I get my pictures organized, I'll try to add photos."
166,1038,"Sep 3 2007 	Hotel ok service could have been better	I stayed in this hotel on the evening of the 1st September after booking it through Travelzoo on a special deal. The deal included 2 free drinks at the hotel bar + 50% off the cost of food in the Chino latino restaraunt. Check in was a little slow &amp; we were told that our vouchers for the drinks &amp; food would be sent to our room as they were not ready for us to collect at reception which was fair enough. Room was fine clean &amp; not too noisy. Came back in the early evening expecting the tickets to be in our room but they were not so I had to ring down &amp; remind them. It was a good job we were not in a hurry as they arrived approx 30 minutes later. Sunday morning started a little earlier than we had expected due to an early morning alarm call at 5.30am (that we did not book) I explained to reception that we had not requested an early morning call but he refused to listen to me. 2 minutes later we received another early morning call as you can imagine I was not at all pleased to get a 2nd one, I decided to take the phone off the hook so as not to be disturbed anymore. My overall experience of the hotel was that it was in a good location,clean &amp; modern but the little niggles tarnished what should have been a fabulous experience."
167,1038,"Sep 2 2007 	Fabulous hotel	Stunning hotel. Although out of centre is only like 10 mins walk to the london eye, westminster and easy to get around.the rooms were gorgeous lovely and clean and even though we were in a room by waterloo station was not that noisy really. Just think your in london do you really expect peace and quiet???? defo stay here again. i stayed at the victoria plaza before but would say this is slightly better although Victoria one is nearer attractions."
168,1038,"Aug 24 2007 	Genuine service	I have stayed at this hotel more than 30 times when visiting London on business.Although a little out of the centre and not really handy for a tube station, it is only a pleasant stroll from the hotel along the river and over Lambeth Bridge to the Houses of Parliament or along Albert Embankment to the attractions of the South Bank (theatres, restaurants, London Eye etc).Forget the poor food that you might normally expect at a British hotel, the Park Plaza's food is restaurant quality (the fillet steak for 19 in the Club Lounge is superb) and the Chino Latino restaurant (East-West fusion) in the hotel, next to the bar, is a destination in its own right.Avoid rooms whose numbers end in 24 (124, 224 etc), these have a wall adjacent to the lifts and you'll hear them rumbling past your room. Room 1124 is the worst for this as it's next to the motors at the top of the hotel.Even-numbered rooms at the back of the hotel on the lower floors may be troubled by noise of trains passing but you soon get used to that. Rooms that face in rather than out are always pretty quiet.The rooms are purpose designed, all double-sized, modern and comfortable with a decent flat-screen tv and dvd, glass desk and a minibar that has a small shelf specially for your own stash.Wide bathrooms of polished black granite have separate bath and shower and plenty of space. On the ground floor, there is a cool, modern and spacious bar.So, when in London, faced with a choice between checking into a cramped converted victorian building with rooms shoe-horned in and in the midst of honking traffic and revving buses ... or a pleasant, purpose-built, spacious and relaxing modern place to stay ... I go for the latter, the Park Plaza on the Albert Embankment. So do cricket teams visiting the nearby Oval."
169,1038,"Aug 19 2007 	Clean modern hotel	We booked through lastminute.com and wanted a fairly central hotel at a reasonable price. We stayed Fri-Mon and booked an executive room as we were in London for my husband's 40th birthday and wanted to make it a bit special. I was aware, due to the reviews on here, that we may be allocated a room with a view of the railway tracks but as neither of us are particularly bothered by noise we were happy enough with this. Check in was swift and curteous but as we had arrived early our room wasn't ready, which we had expected. We were, however, told we had a lovely room with a partial river view. When we returned to the hotel later on we picked up our room keys (again service was fast) and were thrilled with our room. We could see the Thames and parliament and there were no trains to be seen. It would have been nice to have this view from the bed but unfortunately when in bed the view was of a building. Never mind, this is London after all.The robes, slippers, fruit and water that were included in the package were all there as expected. There were plenty of toiletries and they were repenished as needed. Although there were tea and coffee making facilites in the room we didn't use these, but we did pop into the exectutive lounge for hot chocolate in the early hours. The room was clean and well maintained. The only minor negatives were that there was a scorch mark from the iron on the carpet and the toilet cistern sometimes kept running after flushing, but this was not audible from the bedroom. The water pressure in the shower wasn't great, but that is the same in most hotels. It was good to have a seperate shower cubicle rather than a shower over the bath.It was a pleasant 10 minute walk along the Thames to Vauxhall tube station, however on the Saturday the whole Victoria line was closed, which was a little inconvinent, but that's just one of the things you have to accept if you visit London at the weekend. It's not far to walk to the London Eye and a great selection of restaurants on the south bank. I only had breakfast the first morning, but my husband had breakfast all three days. We ate in the executive lounge and it was pretty standard fare, but OK. Two of the three evenings we were there we went to the lounge for drinks and snacks. Each evening drinks and snacks were served from 6-8pm. There was red or white wine and beer as well as soft drinks, along with a selection of dim sum, cheese, crackers, crisps and olives. The lounge was adequately replenished but unfortunately the drinks fridge didn't work, so I stuck to red wine. There was also a drinks machine providing hot drinks 24 hours a day as well as a computer with free internet access. Given that breakfast was included I'd say the executive rate was worth the extra cost.We didn't use the bar or restaurant, but they looked lovely. Contrary to previous reviews we found the service to be friendly and efficient and when we visited all the lifts were in working order and there was no wait. All in all we liked this hotel and would stay again if the price was right."
170,1038,"Aug 18 2007 	Great Experience at the Park Plaza Riverbank	Travel Agent recommended and I adored this hotel. It was brand new, and the rooms were quiet and we had a great view of big ben. The concierge was excellent. I wanted a quiet hotel where there wasn't a lot of hustle and bustle and where we'd feel safe. This was ideal after coming from the states and needing to adjust to the time zone. I wouldn't stay anywhere else next time we visit London."
171,1038,"Aug 17 2007	Ten Cheers for the Park Plaza	When our seventh floor London flat was flooded (burst pipe) and uninhabitable for over a month, we moved into our local Park Plaza Riverside for the duration. It turned out to be the best thing we could have done for ourselves.Albert van der Westhuizen, Senior Guest Relations Manager, showed great sensitivity to our unhappy situation, and helped us considerably by moving us into a lovely suite with river views. The front desk staff were also pleasant and helpful; adding weeks here and days there, as our deadlines to move back home kept changing.We'll never forget their kindness. The Park Plaza is lucky to have such a great crew. We will recommend them to everyone we know.Christine and Jean-Michel"
172,1038,"Aug 16 2007 	Maybe a lottery with the rooms?	Having stayed here recently and subsequently read back over the reviews; I think it maybe is down to room location as to how much one enjoys the experience.The hotel's location is great - no doubt about it. A comfortable walk to the many attractions of the south bank. I thought service was excellent throughout and one could not fault the room in terms of comfort and cleanliness. Reception checking in and out was professional and friendly. The bar was impressive and, again, waiter service was prompt and courteous.So, maybe the rooms overlooking the railway are to be avoided and if this can't be guaranteed - think again about booking. But overall I thought this was an excellent hotel and would stay again."
173,1038,"Aug 11 2007 	Disappointing	Disappointing from start to finish. The hotel location, while near the London Eye, Downing Street (the other side of the Thames), there isn't much around the hotel itself. Check-in and check-out were icy. At first glance the room appeared tidy, however, the carpet was stained, bed sheets torn, the walls scuffed. In fact, had to request slippers as the floor was too dirty to remain barefoot. My room had absolutely no view. If you must stay here, book a room with a view of the Thames, otherwise your view will be of the hotel well or train tracks. Housekeeping never seemed to get it quite right with consistently late service. Tissue paper is apparently at a premium, having to request another roll (rather than being replenished with daily service). Phone did not work without interference, despite having it replaced. The TV was nice but required working knowledge of electrical engineering and if not on, the sole clock and the internet did not work. At least one elevator was always down, often having to wait 5 minutes or more. The restaurants were understaffed and, like the room, nothing special and disappointing. Not even a good cup of coffee, something I look forward to when in Europe. If I were not traveling for business (and compelled to stay there), there would be absolutely no reason I would stay at this hotel. While the hotel may look nice, the website pictures do not tell the whole (unfortunate) story. Annoyance after annoyance. London is a spectacular city, enjoy your evenings elsewhere."
174,1038,"Aug 10 2007 	Comfort and Joy	I was directed to this hotel via a weekly newsletter that I receive: ~Travelzoo. Excellent deal offered and as it then turned out the perfect location for our desired activities (Tate Britain, Modern and the Hayward). The walk along the river to and from these destinations was stunning (weather good thankfully) as was catching the Tate boat between the two galleries. Would recommend this.From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the service was excellent. Any member of staff consulted during the time of our stay could not have been more helpful. We had a room without a view, but as a result, was wonderfully peaceful. It was spacious, clean and well equipped. We availed ourselves of room service for breakfast and this too was excellent.I would stay here anytime and particulary if I wanted to be in that part of London."
175,1038,"Aug 7 2007 	Superb location for business or pleasure!	This is a lovely modern hotel efficiently run. Friendly staff, eager to please.Rooms are very comfortable, very clean and well appointed. Plasma TV/DVD/IT access as standard. Large bathroom with full size bath/shower PLUS level access walk in shower.We booked an 'executive room' without knowing the benefits. MIneral water, fresh fruit, biscuits, all day refreshments in an executive lounge, drinks &amp; canapes between 6pm-8pm and a quiet breakfast room. I throughly recommend this to everyone!!Fantastic cocktails served with a variety of complimentary nibbles - olives, chilli crackers, mixed nuts &amp; savoury biscuits. Both restaurants looked lovely. Unfortunately we did not try 'Chino Latino' but it looks fab and there were people waiting for it to open! We ate in the other restaurant (cannot remember the name right now) three different meals, all very impressive and reasonably priced."
176,1038,"Aug 7 2007 	Great for trainspotters	Was booked into this hotel as I needed to give presentations nearby early the next morning. Arrived late so was &quot;upgraded&quot; to a suite (Rm 303). Should have guessed all was not well when girlfriend asked, when I phoned home, &quot;What's that noise ?&quot; The train noises stopped at 00:40 in the morning - they started again at 04:40. Looking out in the morning I was able to see the earwax of the traindrivers as they used the seven track railway just outside the window.The conclusion to this tale is that half the hotel should be called Riverside the other side Trackside.Oh yes and there was no iron in the room."
177,1038,"Aug 2 2007 	Comfy and peaceful	Stayed in an executive room via a special offer on Travelzoo, was able to check in on arrival at 9.30am as the room was ready and found the room to be comfy with dressing gowns/slippers, fruit, vanity items, water, coffee etc. Air con was lovely as the weather was hot so great to cool down after a sticky day at the cricket. Bar was very trendy with attentive staff, had a great nights sleep with cool room with air con and it was very quiet, we heard nothing all night and I am a light sleeper. Was given a choice of breakfast in Executive suite which was continental or restaurant downstairs for a la carte also included in our package so we ate downstairs, the breakfast was lovely and really set us up for the day. Vauxhall tube is about a 5 min walk which then takes about 15 mins to central London."
178,1038,Jul 24 2007 	Pleasant stay	Organised a special trip to plaza for my husbands 40th birthday surprise. Booked the executive package with all the trimmings. River view room was fantastic looking down the Thames . Room was spacious and comfortable we had room service and the food was wonderful and not to over priced. We had a few niggles like on the second day we could not get into our room so we had to go and get key card changed the coffee etc wasnot refilled when the room was cleaned no newspaper etc these are only small complaints but at a four star hotel they really should get it right. The staff were very polite. Enjoyable stay
179,1038,"Jul 11 2007	OK but poor sound proofing	Overall a pleasant stay, had an executive room, ask if River or Railtrack view, 25 per night upgrade for River view which is worth it. One problem, very poor sound proofing between rooms, could hear upper floor talking etc most of the night and next doors TV at 6.30am in the morning. If you are a poor sleeper, I would not recommend this hotel but very good location for most attractions, such as the London Eye etc."
180,1038,"Jul 7 2007 	Wonderful find!	Terrific location near London's Waterloo Station, across the river from Parlament, Big Ben, etc. Also near London Eye and both Tates. New facilities, very comfortable rooms, nicely appointed."
181,1038,"Jun 30 2007 	Great room but terrible breakfast!	We stayed at this hotel for one night in June 2007. Upon check-in we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a room with a view for an extra 50. The upgrade included breakfast served in the Executive Lounge on the top floor. We thought that this sounded like a good deal so we upgraded.The view from our room was amazing - we looked out on to the Thames and could see the Houses of Parliament really clearly from our window. Our friends had a room facing the opposite side of the hotel and they looked out onto train tracks and were kept awake at night by the noise from the trains.The room was large for a London hotel and the bathroom was enormous! The decor was modern and the room was very clean.The only bad thing during our stay was that the breakfast in the Executive Lounge was the worst I've ever had in a hotel. There was no hot food available when we arrived, other than some burnt looking baked potatoes!? The cold selection of food was extremely limited and they seemed to have run out of juice completely. Eventually some Eggs Benedict arrived and were put out on the buffet. Unfortunately these were stone cold and were simply placed over a small flame in an attempt to heat them up! All in all very disappointing and we felt a bit cheated. Our friends had breakfast in the main restaurant and it sounded great - so be warned, if you have a package that includes breakfast, see if you can eat it in the restaurant rather than the Executive Lounge!"
182,1038,"Jun 27 2007 	Shame about the view	I stayed at this hotel in June 2007. It's quite a modern establishment and definitely has tones of 'Hotel Babylon', especially the bar. Staff were courteous and friendly. The room was fine - lovely bathroom. One drawback was that the view was over about 12 railways. The soundproofing was good though. We were a little disappointed as the blurb boasts of the views down - river to Big Ben. Public transport is a little iffy too."
183,1038,"Jun 25 2007 	iffy	Booked this hotel as top secret choice on last minute, got a good enough deal and was quite pleased to hear on checking in that we had been upgraded to a suite. Kind of wish they hadn't bothered..When we got to the room the mini bar was locked (stayed locked through out our stay, but this didn't stop them from trying to charge us for a number of items from it). There was mould and dampness in the main wardrobe, the skirting was crumbling and it smelt awful so that stayed closed through out the stay. As mentioned in a previous review the bathroom light didn't switch off so we also found an alternative use for the (single) complementary robe. Despite the lack of AC in the bedroom and the hot weather that weekend, the windows in the bedroom had been locked which was made all the more frustrating by the presence of the balcony, so also did as the previous reviewer did and slept with the door to lounge open. The house keeping in the room was very poor- previous guest's choclate wrapper in the bed side locker, red wine splashed all across the living room wall. On the plus side the quality of the breakfast is good, the reception staff were very good and the design of the hotel is good. Strangely despite all my criticisms I would consider staying here again if the proce was right and hope that I ahd just been given a poorly maintained room. Riverbank Palza if you read this you really should take a look at the wardrobe in room 1021 this problem should not really be occurring in a relatively new building."
184,1038,"Jun 24 2007	Very confortable	Hotel booked by Trafalgar for our tour.Very clean, very comfortable beds, modern rooms.View of the train rails, not very nice but a room is for sleeping and we slept very well. Even if you could still hear a bit the trains passing. We didn't mind, it helped us go to sleep, go figure.A lot of amenities, tea, coffee, full bathroom products, modern audio/video system. Nice restaurant. Close to the parliament, metro (underground) and the London eye. Don't try to exchange money early in the morning, if they don't have the exchange rate they will send you to the ATM outside. Concierge very helpful and knows the good pubs."
185,1038,"Jun 24 2007 	Lovely hotel in a great location	Stayed for 4 nights in this hotel in June 2007.Our room was very modern with a spacious bathroom and all other amenities such as TV/DVD, tea/coffee, safe, iron etc. The staff were very friendly and approachable. The continental breakfast was okay, but felt it was let down by limited choice and poor quality ingredients eg diluted orange juice and cheap cereals. My only other gripe is that each bed only had one pillow and the beds were so hard that I did find it difficult to sleep.Overall though I'd definitely stay there again and would recommend this hotel to everyone."
186,1038,"Jun 17 2007	Perfect for the weekend travelers.	Have just arrived from a stay i Riverbank Park Plaza, London. A fantastic hotel just by the River Thems. Not far from the london eye and many other attractions. It took us 10 minutes walk to the London eye. Very nice rooms, light colors and modern furnitures. The bathroom was &quot;Wow&quot; all in black and white.The resturant Chino latino had delicous food. Everyone in the staf was very serviceminded and helpsam.This is a hotel we will come back to."
187,1038,"Jun 17 2007 	Enjoyable stay	I booked my 4-night stay through Lastminute.com's Top Secret Hotels, and decided to plump for the executive package, as this, including breakfast, cost the same as the hotel's Web rate for a standard room. On check-in I received a surprise: I had been upgraded to a suite! The suite consisted of a lounge with a desk and chair, sofabed and two comfy chairs, and a large cabinet with a minibar and a flatscreen TV. The bedroom had a comfortable double bed, and was clearly supposed to have a TV, but it had been taken away for repairs. The bathroom was modern, but dimly lit, and had a shower with very good pressure and a separate bathtub. There was a light over the bathtub that wouldn't switch off, and despite my calling housekeeping nothing was done about this. I solved the situation by placing my complimentary robe across the door opening, blocking the light.The complimentary mineral water and fruit that came with my package wasn't in the room when I arrived, so I had to call and ask for it, but it arrived quickly. I found housekeeping to be very diligent, except for the bathroom light. When I called to ask what the TV situation was in the bedroom, they kept insisting that they would be happy to come and move the TV out of the lounge, even though I said that I was just inquiring as to the situation. The bathroom sink leaked, and this was also dealt with while I was out. I didn't experience any of the problems with lighting in the bedroom that I had read about in previous reviews, so I had no trouble reading in bed. One minor gripe is that there no air conditioning in the bedroom. I solved this by sleeping with the bedroom door open. Otherwise, the air conditioning worked well.Unfortunately my worst fear from reading the reviews came true. I was given a room facing the train tracks. Luckily my suite was on the 11th floor, so it wasn't noisy enought to be a problem while I was awake. Unfortunately I'm a light sleeper, so I was woken by the trains rumbling by at 4 am, but I managed to fall asleep again.Breakfast in the executive lounge was excellent. During the week, breakfast was fancy: Eggs Benedict, sausages with bacon rolled around them, potatoes, and all the other traditional components of a full English buffet. At the weekend, yummy scrambled eggs replaced the Eggs Benedict. I only made it to the early evening wine and canape evening once, but they served lovely dim sum from the Chino Latino restaurant.We had one meal at Chino Latino. It was a mixed experienced. The food was excellent - especially the plum tatin dessert. Unfortunately one of our starters was cold in the middle. They took it back, and after about 15 minutes we received a new starter - half the size of the original. We complained again, and ended up getting our full starter together with the main course. There were some apologies, and we were handed off to a more senior server, possibly even the maitre 'd, but no complimentary drink or dessert, despite this delaying our meal by half an hour.I chose express checkout, so that went smoothly. That is, after we called down to reception and asked why our bill hadn't been slipped under the door.All in all, for the price I paid, I'd definitely stay here again if I could be sure that my room wasn't facing the train tracks. I've discovered that the hotel now advertises riverview rates on their Web site, so I might consider doing that in the future. Except for the bathroom light, all my queries to housekeeping were dealt with very quickly. And the location was excellent! There's a bus stop right in front of the hotel, which is handy from travel to/from Waterloo. Lambeth Bridge is practically next to the hotel, and has a bus stop that takes you right up Regent Street."
188,1038,"Jun 13 2007	Extraordinary!	Hello!We strongly recommend this hotel! This Easter we spend three nights at this luxurious hotel. We were very well treated. The staff was helpful and friendly. For example, they helped us with bustickets and our sons birthday celebration, early in the morning! The rooms were spacious stylish equiped.We also strongly recommend the restaurant., Chino Latino Brasserie! It was an extraordinary experience, the food as well as the staff. They were so nice and treated us to a glas of champagne because of our wedding anniversary and our 50th-birthdays.Hkan and Birgitta Arin with children, Matilda, Nils, Amanda och Anton, Strandv. 8, 571 38, Nssj, Sweden"
189,1038,"Jun 11 2007 	Great Weekend	Had a great long weekend at the beginning of june to which this hotel contributed. Upon check in staff were very helpful and efficient. We were in our room within 5 minutes. The hotel was sleek and modern with a welcoming atmosphere.We stayed in a superior room and had no complaints, plenty of room for 2 people, with a comfy bed and LCD television with plenty of channels. Iron and ironing board was provided and proved very useful. There was also a safe provided within the room free of charge which was a bonus. The bathroom was very nice with a seperate bath and nice powerfull shower, most importantly it was nice and clean!!!The room was very clean and fresh, housekeeping came in every day and we always came back to a welcoming room.We ordered room sevice and food came within the stated 25 minutes, again staff very friendly and the food was very nice at reasonable prices.The location of the hotel was great with lovely views. It was just short walks away to many local attractions and around 5-10 minutes to the nearest tube.Check out was again quick and easy. The hotel was happy to hold on to our luggage while we went out for the morning and collected it in the afternoon when we were due to catch a train.Would reccomend this hotel and would return to this hotel again."
190,1038,"Jun 5 2007	Gorgeous hotel!	Just returned from a three night break at the Riverbank Park Plaza. Like many others, we booked this via lastminute.com's 'top secret hotel' and got a fantastic rate for our stay. First impressions were good, friendly staff and beautiful decor. Our room was perfect - big comfy bed and a spotless bathroom. Unfortunately we did not have a room with a view of the Thames - this was available via an upgrade, but this would have doubled our holiday price so we decided against it! We overlooked an office block, although this didn't bother us as we weren't in the room much, and we were in close proximity to a train track which was noisy during the day, but luckily didn't keep us awake at night.The hotel is about a five/ten minute walk from Vauxhall tube station on the Victoria line, or about twenty minutes from Waterloo station. There is a small off-licence close to the hotel incase of emergencies! A leisurely walk from the hotel along the Thames brings you out at the London Eye and Aquarium, with beautiful views of the Houses of Parliament on the way.We would definitely stay in this hotel again - would recommend it to anyone who would like a base set back from the general hustle and bustle of central London, but wants ease of access to the centre."
191,1038,"Jun 2 2007	the best ;0)	ABSOLUTELY STUNNING - my friend &amp; I booked 2 rooms at the Park Plaza riverbank hotel last WE - we were with Adrien (10) &amp; No (9) - we had the warmest welcome ever, the staff was absolutely lovely, the rooms with a view on the 7th floor were an adventure in itself for the kids...&amp; the mums (we came back home with drawings of the London Eye, Big Ben, the Thames &amp; the fish, the fire station which is next door...:0) The room impressed them more than the Star Wars exhibition, which wasa terrific experience too, as well as the London Eye ride. We appreciated the late check out VERY MUCH especially since it was pouring down with rain &amp; we could see Big Ben get wet as we were watching a DVD in the room, lying on the most comfortable &amp; thickest mattress I've ever seen. The bathroom was a real pleasure: massaging shower, big bathtub, stunning deco. The welcome fruits were quite...welcome. The bar tenders at the Cafe Latino were SO nice &amp; handsome too! The served the best cafe Latte. The bar is very 'branch' &amp; the view fromthe Thames room, where an Indian wedding was going on is a wonder to the eyes (we were lucky to see the most glittery &amp; elegant outfits &amp; dresses while waiting to do the check-in or upon taking the lift) 25' walk to the Waterloo station (7.50 by taxi) was real handyMost of the 'things to see' were at walking distance. The grocery store nextdoor has everything you need &amp; the tenants are really kind. The fire station also nextdoor is the 3rd busiest in Europe - &amp; although we ddidn't hear any alarms, we got to visit it with the kids thanks to the kindness of these great fire fighters.  We'd like to thank ALBERT, Senior Guest Relations Manager, for all the warmth, kindness, attention, great service &amp; good humour we received during our short stay. Thanks for making it happen: a WONDERFUL rainy WE in an amazing hotel. We will come back for sure...Without the kids ;0)MERCI from BelgiumValy &amp; AdrienVirginie &amp; No"
192,1038,"May 29 2007 	Very good London Hotel on South Bank	My husband, myself and my parents just returned from two nights at the Riverbank Park Plaza in London. I booked the two rooms on LastMinute.com and got fantastic room rates for this holiday weekend. The hotel is located on the South Bank of the Thames, one block southwest of the Lambuth bridge, within site of the London Eye and Westminster. The hotel is very comtemporary and 'trendy' with an upscale modern-Asian fusion influence. The rooms are nicely equipped with large comfortable beds, flat screen TV with DVD player, computer desk and internet access, minibar and coffee/tea facilites in the rooms. The bathrooms were fabulous - large with separate modern shower and tub in marble &amp; chrome decor. Lighting in the rooms was very nice - automatic light in closet with personal safe, recessed amber lighting above windows, light blocking draperies. We paid extra for breakfast on a special weekend rate ($25 per couple per day) and were very disappointed. While there was a variety of cereals, pastries, fruit and full English breakfast fare offered, the food was not well prepared - scrambled eggs were watery and cold, pastries were stale, service was slow. There are two restaurants available for lunch/dinner - one is the Club Lounge offering traditional food that was unfortunately not open on Sunday or Monday during our stay, as Monday was a bank holiday. THe other restaurant is the Chino Latino Brassiere, an upscale restaurant offering Asian-Mediterranean foods in a contemporary fusion decor. Unfortunately, there are no other restaurants in the immediate vicinity of this hotel - you either eat there or be prepared to walk at least two blocks or take a taxi. We did order room service on the first night - it was delivered within the quoted 30 minutes and the food was very good. I would return to this hotel IF I could get another great deal on the room rates; otherwise, I would look for a hotel closer to restaurants/pubs, etc."
193,1038,"May 27 2007 	Riverbank Plaza Hotel	We stayed here for a single night on a Friday as we were going to a gig in London. The only fault I could find was the queue to check outon Saturday morning at 11:30. Everything else was excellent. We booked through lastminute.com and got an excellent deal. After the gig we couldn't find any decent food, so had room service, well afterthe main restaurant had closed. We were served after about 30 minutes, with a very nice meal, and reasonably priced."

Got it as a secret hotel on last minute, but guessed at the hotel from the description. Got an executive room and breakfast for 124. At first the hotel looked great, really stylish and the reception staff were so helpful, however got to the room and problems began to arise.....we arrived late afternoon and had dinner reservations so had to get ready in quite a rush, the bath did not hold the water! called housekeeping, very rude and 25 mins later i just had a shower! got back to the htoel and found SERVERAL holes in the sheets like mice had been at them, woke up the next morning and our key card would not let us go in the executive lounge(which was small and dingey), all in all this hotel was hassle! my advice pay an extra 40 or so and go 5 star, in london the difference is really noticeable!"
195,1038,May 18 2007	excellent riverbank	Dream room. Fantastic view over the Thames. Very clean room. The experience staying in the Hotel was excellent and very luxury. The hospitality was all over outstanding and an example of how it should be.When I had a question the staffs helped me quick and were very reactive. The next time I stay in London I will definitely try to book a room in the Park Plaza Riverbank London. I would recommed this hotel to everyone!!

But at the end we found the Park Plaza Riverside, which was a very good choice. The location was very good with a superb view. Rooms been very clean and staff was helpful and friendly. Definitively one highlight is the bar and stylish restaurant at the lobby. We enjoyed beeing there."
198,1038,"Apr 29 2007 	A Connecticut's Family Great Experience!!!	The Riverbank Plaza was everything you would expect from a first class hotel and more. Our room faced the river Thames with beautiful views of Westminister, Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. In the evening they were illuminated and the reflections in the river were gorgeous. If we didn't have plans for sightseeing we could have just stayed in the room and drank up the panoramic views.The hotel is very convenient to the London Eye, a short walk up the Thames, Waterloo Station another short walk and we could stroll across one of the bridges and be in the West End or Big Ben in about 15 minutes or so. The walks along the Thames are fabulous, you can actually walk all the way to London Bridge on one side and back on the other side. The hotel is in a quiet area so its very peaceful to come back to. There's a small grocery store a few steps away where you can pick up wine, fruits etc.The staff went out of there way to make us feel comfortable and the buffet breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of hot and cold foods.The concierge was most helpful with any questions that we had.We would without question stay here again. It was wonderful!"
199,1038,"Apr 26 2007 	Exceeds expectations	Overall, I had an extremely pleasant experience at the Riverbank Park Plaza. I got a weekend special of 76 GBP which included breakfast. Althought I was traveling alone, I had a double room (no view) but I did not get the &quot;railroad&quot;view that others complained about. In fact, the view was to the interior of the building. However, in London, who stays in the room? In any event, the room was high-tech -- DVD, plasma TV, internet, room lights do not work unless you insert your room key card in a special slot @ the door. The room was decorated in modern, clean lines with leather and black painted wood furniture. Bathroom has a separate shower, a &quot;huge&quot; tub and all new chrome faucets with granite floors and countertops. While some have complained that it was not close to the sights, I found I could walk across the river to the Houses of Parliament in five minutes. London Eye/County Hall is about a ten minute walk up the Thames and the river is literally right outside the front door of the hotel. If you're doing London on a budget, there's a small grocery store adjacent to the hotel that sells wine, liquor and other grocery items.Finally, if you want to go sightseeing, the local sightseeing company stops about 1 block from the hotel and will carry you all over London for about 22 GBP. The sightseeing pass is good for 24 hours and allows you to use it on two different days. I am definitely going to return to the Riverbank. I had a great stay in London."
200,1038,"Apr 21 2007 	Very Modern Feel	Went to this Hotel on Easter weekend as part of theatre package wityh Last Minute.com. Hotel was actually not named on LM.com but with a bit of research it was easy to find where we might be staying. Overall felt it was a good deal.Hotel 15 mins walk from Waterloo or Pimilco tube stations or 10 minutes from Vauxhall Tube on the South Bank opposite the Tate Britain, very easy to find as only building that has hotel type frontage.Hotel also appears to form part of apartment block for longer term residents though they have their own entrance.Customer service was very good at reception, with our bags being looked after pre-check in so that we could see the matinee show. There were a number of weekend offers available on check-in that would allow us free first drink though this was difficult to completely understand as the receptionists accent was very strong. Good service though.We were located on the 9th floor in room that gave just a glimpse of the River. Room comfortable size compared to other London hotel rooms, with high standard of fittings, large lcd Tv and DVD player, internet acccess.Went for pre meal drinks in the cocktail bar. Prices were what I would expect though did feel strange not seeing the cocktails not being made front of house. They were made behind a stained glass window highlighting the drinks.Went to get a meal in the lounge downstairs, however this was fully booked, be warned. Decided to give the in house Chino Latino restaurant a go. Food I would say was not terrific value given the standard, very Sushi/ sea food orientated. Service was very good.Cannot comment on breakfast as we both felt 17.50 each was too much for breakfast when we don't eat that much.Good base for a weekend in London if you like modern hotels."
201,1038,"Apr 20 2007	One of the best....	Park Plaza Riverbank, London! Great Hotel!Good location! Excellent staff! Easy to find! Restaurant was excellent! Fantastic rooms!Overall it was a fantstic experience and one of the best hotels that I visit!"
202,1038,"Apr 15 2007 	fabulous hotel	Stayed with my husband and two children for 3 nights from 10th to 13th April. Husband there on business and thought as it was school holidays we would make most of it and join him. Hotel was great...spotlessly clean, staff very friendly and helpful and breakfasts great.Location overlooking the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben was perfect. Great walk along the Thames to the London Eye of about 15 minutes. Nearest tube station was Vauxhall on Victoria line about 5 mins walk.We had interconnecting rooms so kids had a room of their own. Rooms were cleaned to a high standard each day although a little on the warm side. Breakfasts were great , buffet style with hot and cold choices.All in all we had a wonderful time and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others."
203,1038,"Apr 3 2007 	Stunning Views and Fabulous Food	Riverbank Park Plaza is a really stylish, chic property despite having almost 400 rooms.Our bedroom was very comfortable with an absolutely stunning view overlooking the House of Commons, Big Ben and the River Thames. The room itself was very well laid, everything you needed was there including an iron and ironing board which is a godsend if you are anything like me - packing at the last minute with no time to iron anything! The bathroom was spacious with a seperate bath and shower and a decent selection of toiletries. Overall, not too bad at all.Had diiner in the hotel restaurant 'Chino Latino' and it really was excellent. We had several different starters to share including Tempura Prawns which were fantastic. The Black Cod is to die for, better than Nobu which is not surprising considering the hotel have poached the chef from there! (padon the pun) Really, you should try it out when you are there or just go for the evening, you won't be sorry. The bar area was packed, but not unpleasantly so, plenty of seating and attentive service. I can recommend the Watermelon Martinis.Overall, as large corporate hotels go, Riverbank Park Plaza was a very pleasant surprise. The location could be better, but it was a great place to spend an evening."
204,1038,"Apr 3 2007 	Great Hotel Below Standard Service	This is great looking hotel, and wonderful rooms and facilities inside, the executive upgrade is well worth it with the drinks and canapes in the lounge in the evening and a more relaxed breakfast experience. Location wise the hotel is good especially if you are happy roaming along the southbank and not adverse to a little bit of a walk rather than immediate access to underground network - although its still only 5 mins away.The downside - the service was slow and not particularly welcoming. Many mistakes were made with our room, our bill, mistaking our deal etc. Restaurant staff in club lounge were really friendly and up beat though.All in all we would recommend this hotel for a long weekend just be prepared for the slightly below average service!"
205,1038,"Apr 2 2007 	Futuristic Hotel	Having stayed regularly at the City Inn in London I decided to move and give the Park Plaza a go. And was I glad!! Just like the City Inn the location is excellent and easily accessible.Upon arrival I was greeted by concierge who helped by from the taxi. The entrance hall is very impressive and contemporary. The reception staff were very helpful and I was quickly booked into my room. The lift leading to the room was amazing with star style lighting. Everything was really futuristic, something you would expect to see in a hotel in Tokyo.The room was fantastic, very clean with a huge bed, flat screen and a media centre. This was much more than expected. The bathroom was even better with a large bath, separate glass shower cubical, halogen spotlights and beautiful black floor tiles.My only minor complaint was surrounding the minibar. Basically it wouldnt open and when I rang reception I was told it would be sorted in two minutes. Twenty minutes later I rang back and was told it couldnt be opened because I didnt log my credit card number. I find this quite odd as I had a room allowance but was told that its part of the system! What was really strange was the fact that I could order drinks via room service without any questions.Breakfast was a buffet style service and provided plenty of choice which was very welcome. The service was excellent and I was given a table in no time.Overall this is a fantastic hotel in an excellent part of town. Really conferrable with good service most of the time. I would definably recommend this and I believe its a better bet than the nearby City Inn."
206,1038,"Mar 30 2007 	Nice Hotel shame about the location!!	A nice hotel but not exactly close to the train station as they said! A good half hour walk from Waterloo if I am honest. Room was nice, staff ok but bar was expensive (yes I know it is London) and the coffee's we ordered were luke warm. We paid 99 for our one night stay on lastminute.com but I would recommend you contacted the hotel directly as they seem to be ably to do a better deal direct. Breakfast is 17.00 per head which is pricey (again I know it is in London). Overall the stay was nice but I would sooner stay a little closer to the tube I think as with the weather not being great it did take a while to walk to Vauxhall (by far the nearest station).P.s. Would appear if you wear a suit in the bar you seem to get noticed a lot quicker - considering the price the service there was not quick for those dressed more casually."
207,1038,"Mar 28 2007 	Like sleeping in a train station poor service the executive package is lies!	Rubbish!Trains every 30 seconds or so RIGHT in front of our window, staff were unfriendly and arrogant when we complained. We booked the executive package which gave us access to the exec lounge and &quot;drinks &amp; snacks throughout the day&quot;. At one stage there were a few biscuits in a box and that was all, staff told us&quot;&quot; Oh no,it only opens between 6-8&quot;Disorganised, unhelpful, misadvertised, rubbish. All the effort has gone into the decor, no-one gave a damn about service.Do yourself a favour &amp; find another place to stay!!"
208,1038,"Mar 26 2007 	Excellent hotel	The hotel is ideally situated just across the River Thames opposite Big Ben and Houses of Parliament. A stylish, chic hotel of a very high standard. Excellent breakfast, staff very helpful and professional, cannot do enough for you. When staying over in London again will definitely use this hotel."
209,1038,"Mar 25 2007 	Comfortable stay with some service issues	Hotel search for our 3 week London trip was dominated by the requirement for high-speed in-room internet access and under $200USD/night, within 10 mins to a tube. Various searches (laterooms, venere, londonview, hotelsrus, etc) lead me to the Riverbank Park Plaza. I contacted the hotel directly and received a great quote of 69 GBP/night for 2 adults. It was a special winter promo package rate for &quot;Non Smoking superior room, internet access, full English breakfast voucher for &quot;Buy one get one free&quot; to use in bar, 50% discount on food only in restaurant.&quot; Location: between Waterloo (15 min) &amp; Vauxhall (5 min) tubes. It was pleasant walking the embankment towards London Eye, Westminister every day. Check-in: Callous. The Riverbank web site advertised that &quot;Each room is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities including high-speed Internet, fax &amp; modem points, flat screen televisions, EU/US power sockets, direct dial telephone, a large work desk, mini-bar, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, laptop safe plus movie &amp; music channels on demand.&quot; Since they didn't charge extra for these other amenities i was quite surprised upon check-in that they would be charging us extra for the 24-hr internet access. ESPECIALLY since i had specifically emailed and verified with staff prior to arrival. When i showed them the email print out, the staff manager on duty simply shrugged and said the employee who had been corresponding with me was wrong, and there was nothing more to be done.We were still focusing on the bright side: 69 GBP with breakfast included was still a great rate for a business hotel in London. The hotel was in a great location, and there was a cool, hip bar/resto (Chino Latino) in the lobby to use our voucher.Room: 9th floor. Sleek, dark, modern furnishings, with jewel toned upholstery. The bed had nice firm pillows, crisp, cotton sheets, and fluffy comforter. Room was spotlessly cleaned every day, stable temperature with an adjustable thermostat. There were multiple plug-points (multi-region too) under the desk, which was really handy since we had 2 laptops and 2 cell phones to charge every night. What was a MAJOR disappointment and problem during our 7 day stay: the internet was down for 3 business days. It was an issue wit the ISP, which was not within the hotel's control. This time, the management was responsive and refunded the internet charge. Bathroom: was fairly large, modern fittings (large square sink, black/white tiling and steel fittings) about six steps between the loo and tub directly across. There was a shower stall (roomy, with glass door, excellent pressure) as well as a tub. The room did have a horrid view - situated on the side of the building, there was a tall office building with lots of windows, directly across from our room, with the train tracks towards the back. I'm not sure if we were just heavy sleepers during this trip or if the windows are double-reinforced, but the noise from the tracks did not bother our sleep. Breakfast: each morning, we went down to the ground floor, past the business center, to the cafeteria where the complimentary breakfast was served. It is a large room, with a sitting area with couches as well as cafeteria style tables/chairs. Pleasant staff greeted us, verified our room number and seated us promptly. Coffee and tea were served at our table, and refilled appropriately. Spouse ordered egg-whites every day (off menu) and was accomodated without fuss. The rest of the breakfast was buffet style/self-serve. There was one station with scrambled eggs (egg beaters), heinz beans, whole steamed mushrooms, bacon &amp; sausage. There was a 2nd station with an assortment of breakfast pastries (croissants, fruit cake, muffins, danishes - all fresh from somewhere, everyday), fruit salad (water melon, apples, grapes, oranges, berries, melon), stewed prunes &amp; figs, yogurt, muesli, white and dark bread, 3 types of cheeses and the usual assortment of orange &amp; strawberry jams. There was a juice station: apple, orange &amp; grapefruit. For a breakfast-inclusive rate, this was a good spread. My carnivore spouse got his fill of egg whites, bacon &amp; sausage and topped it off with brekafast pastries and juice. I was perfectly happy with the fresh fruit salad, muesli, yogurt, mushrooms and beans and muffins/croissant. Overall: we loved the location. Have great memories of our walks on the embankment. Chino Latino was cool to hang out at, and conveneint meeting place for quick get-together with business associates. Close proximity to Waterloo made it really convenient ot catch our Eurostar connection to Paris on the last day. Our room was fine for us, and aside form the cold reception at check-in and the ISP blip for th 3 days, we had no issues with our stay. During this trip we also stayed at Sunborn Yacht and Sumner Hotel. The Riverbank had better breakfast, the Sumner had reliable internet access, the Sunborn had reliable internet, average room with an expensive, poor quality breakfast."
210,1038,"Mar 20 2007 	Fantastic 	I stayed at this hotel on 2nd &amp; 3rd March 2007 for my husbands 30th Birthday. I booked direct on hotel website and had a good weekend rate. Arrived at hotel 13.30 and was able to check in straight away and to our surprise upgraded to their 5* accomodation section 'Plaza on the River' and now had an executive suite. This was amazing seperate check in desk, champagne on arrival etc. The room was fantastic. It was our own little flat for the weekend. Had FULL kitchen facilities right down to dishwasher and washing machine. Dining Table and Chairs, Leather Sofa, Huge bed, Walk in shower, Flat screen TV you name it, the room had it. We had room service breakfast the two mornings, delivered and all set up for us. Turn down service with chocolates each evening. Those little things make all the difference. It did to us anyway. The hotel was very modern and chic. Quite expensive for drinks in hotel 12.50 for a pint of lager and a vodka and lemonade but you are central london, so that was expected and at a 5* hotel. We didn't use the tube at any time, we walked everwhere, as long as you don't mind walking - Good Advice - Wear comfortable shoes - I had to buy a new pair. I think you see more sights that way. A taxi from Paddingon cost us 8 there, but 12 on return because of traffic. A taxi into or from covent gardens/leicester square in the evening was anything between 7 and 11 depending on traffic and which route the driver took. This seemed to be the area to be in the evening. Saw Phantom of Opera also on Sat Eve - Amazing show !!!! Amazing Hotel !!!!!! Great Weekend !!!!!"
211,1038,"Mar 14 2007 	the good the bad and the ugly!	Booked on a special from last minute a couple of weeks ago....THE GOODvery impressive reception,bar and stylish and spacious bedrooms.Had dinner in the resteraunt(asian/western fusion) and it was surprisingly good,far better than I'd hoped for and not too pricey.THE BADNot really the ideal position to enjoy the nightlife.The telly was on the blink,The rather funky looking shower had nothing more than a drizzle(I had to run around to get wet!),Only one cup for making the tea,the window's were fitted with locks I couldn't open,and no hairdryer in the room(we asked but it never came).THE UGLY The room(as i'm told all standard rooms) overlooked the railway line and the bins,trains were pretty constant."
212,1038,Mar 14 2007 	Great Stay	Had a lovely long weekend during a Spanish bank holiday that allowed going back to London for a few days. The hotel was recommended by a friend and we are still gratefull he did that. Staff was very warm and welcoming - made us feel at home. At some point requested additional towels and less than five minutes later we were given 5 freshly washed towels. Great service.Rooms nicely firnished and we were lucky to have a riverview room - a true kodak moment! If some people complain about the hotel being off track we disagree. It might be a five minutes walk to the next tube but busses and taxis are available and when in London you will appreciate having one of the most splendid walks alongside the Thames in front of your doorstepp. Working in toursim myself in Spain I can highly recommend this hotel - well done.Eddy from Palma de Mallorca
213,1038,"Mar 8 2007	Great value great location!	I booked the Riverbank Plaza online at Lastminute.com and got a great deal, I needed a hotel close to either Waterloo or Vauxhall stations and at 100 for a Monday night I thought it was a bargain.The location is fantastic, literally a 5 minute walk to Vauxhall.I was early arriving at the hotel and thought I would have to put my bags in with the Conceierge, but at 11.30am I was able to check in and move into my room.The rooms were spacious and modern, the beds were large and comfortable. The bathrooms were huge with a seperate bath and walk in shower. Plasma TV, internet via the TV, mini bar, all the things you'd expect.The gym was OK, just some cardio equipment, no free weights or weight machines.The only grumble, but I knew about the possibility of it before I arrived, was my room backed onto the train track, so the noise of the trains was a slight problem, nothing that some ear plugs wouldn't solve.I will definately be staying at this hotel again, having previously stayed on the other side of the river I will be booking in next time I'm in London to party as there are a number of excellent (gay)clubs in the area: Crash, Fire and Area: and being able to stumble back to the hotel and not bother with taxis!"
214,1038,"Mar 8 2007 	Lovely hotel shame about the view	Was a really lovely hotel! Room was great the only prob was where we was in a superior not a executive room we had a view of building work and a railway track! Made me and my parnter feel cheated because it had said views of all theselondon attractions did not state you had to stay in the executive room! It gave me the feeling of ' well they are in a lower class room, so lets give them the view of a railway track.' I undertand you get waht you pay for but the superiour room does not come cheap!I was very dissapointed the hotel is not in walking distace of anything apart from a 15minute walk to the train station that you have to walk unless we stayed in a counted the number of trains that went by!"
215,1038,"Mar 5 2007	Great Location Excellent VFM	Stayed here on Saturday night and booked it as a last minute secret hotel bargain and what a treat it was. Room was ready when we checked in at 2pm, which was unusual for a London hotel. The room was spacious, the bed was really comfy and after a bit of a false start, we got the hang of the flat screen TV and wireless internet stuff!! Lovely bathroom - deep bath and separate shower stall.As we had an executive room, we got a tray of goodies delivered including slippers, fruit, biscuits, mineral water and exec toiletries that went straight in my case to come home!Exec lounge on the 11th floor offered free drinks between 1800 - 2000 and breakfast was served there on the Sunday morning.OK, so we didn't have the best view in the world but we didn't stay there to look out of the window - we were out and about enjoying London and watching the flat screen when in the room.The only downside was the slightly whiffy smell of pee in the corridor. It looked as if something had been spilled on the carpet and then cleaned up, but the carpet hadn't dried out properly. Again, not a great big deal.Would definitely stay again."
216,1038,"Feb 8 2007 	Railtrack view!!!!!	I have only just returned from staying at the Riverbank Plaza, in the Albert Embankment which was booked through my business contacts. Arriving at 1230hours my room was still not available until after1400hrs. This proved a problem as I had afternoon appointments, and it would have been nice to freshen up prior to these. I finally got my room on the 9th floor, and was very disappointed to find a variety of body hair in my bed. Things got worse as after finally getting to sleep I was awoken at 0530hrs by the trains running outside the window, which did not stop until it was time that I had to get up. Breakfast was very good and checkout was no problem.My advice to any visitor to this hotel is get a river facing room or stay at the sister hotel - the Victoria Park Plaza in Victoria, which has better travel links. I appreciate that there are many happy reviews, I would be the same if I would have had a different room."
217,1038,"Jan 30 2007 	Riverbank Plaza	The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Vauxhall station. We arrived early but were delighted to learn that our room was ready. We booked an executive room using a special winter promotion the hotel was running. Unfortunately although the receptionist did try she could not get us a room with a view though she did say our room was on the quieter side of the hotel. The room really was no bigger than other rooms we've stayed in though we liked the bathroom with its walk in shower. The only view from the room was of other bedroom windows opposite - good job the curtains were of the blackout type!The executive package enabled us to visit the exec lounge for refreshments during the day and in the evening for canapes and complimentary wine. We didn't like the exec lounge: it looked a bit like a canteen, was odd shaped with had no atmosphere. If they'd built this at the front of the building with its fantastic views, made it larger and had some soft background music playing it would have been great. However the complimentary canapes and wine before going out were a wonderful bonus. The beds were reasonably comfortable although one gripe was that the window in the room was locked shut though there was air conditioning. Heating though was good and we never felt cold. As promised, the room was quiet.We were disappointed (though secretly relieved) the next morning that the exec lounge was full for breakfast with a 10 -15 minute wait so we went to the club lounge. Breakfast was the usual standard hotel fare.We visited the bar after our theatre trip but found it very smoky.Overall impressions: an imposing hotel with great views if you can get them. In our experience paying extra for an executive room is not worth the money. Although we enjoyed our stay we felt the hotel lacks a bit in atmosphere and warmth."
218,1038,Jan 23 2007 	Excellent	Staying at this hotel gave us nothing else but a memorable stay. Everything from the checkin til checkout was great. As my father had his 70th birthday we got a upgrade and the rooms were very tasteful. We recommed this hotel for your stay i London and you will not be dissapointed.Best regardsJohan
219,1038,"Jan 17 2007	great full and excelent	The hotel was perfekt lokated and a perfekt near the river Thames, with lovely view over too Big Ben and the Parlament.It`s close too the subway and Oxford Street with all the perfekt shooping.The restaurant food was very tastefull and beatyfull arrenged. We had our breakfast att the lounchclub on 11 floor, the breakfast taste very good and had lots of different kind selection on the breakfast meny .The room was great and veiw form the River Thames.My wife and i had a greatfull tripp too London over a weekend and the staff was very nice and helpfull to us.We can senserly rekommend this Hotel and we will come bank again.This is a very pleasant hotel to stay att and the food in the restaurant you shouldend miss becaurse it is so good."
220,1038,"Jan 16 2007	Fantastic views - great service	This is my second stay in the Riverbank Park Plaza - a very clean, thoroughly modern hotel within 10 minutes walk to Vauxhall Station.On my first stay, I was allocated a room at the rear of the hotel - backing onto Waterloo railway line - so the noise was rather intrusive. This time however I was allocated an Executive room at the front of the hotel with, in my view, probably one of the best views down the Thames towards Westminster &amp; the London Eye.Rooms extremely well appointed and the separate shower cubicle in the bathroom is a great, if uncommon asset in London hotels. Executive upgrade is well worth the money - as previous guests have written, it includes access to the Executive lounge but also allows you to choose breakfast in the Chino Latino restaurant (far superior to that served in the main restaurant) or in the Executive Lounge.Although some previous reviews have suggested poor levels of service, my experience has been that levels of customer service are exemplary - polite, friendly and very efficient. A combination of well appointed modern rooms, superb views and excellent customer service means that Riverbank Park Plaza may take some of my custom away from City Inn on the other side of the river - if I can be sure of securing a room at the front of the hotel."
221,1038,"Jan 16 2007 	Elegant AND Friendly	For those who like a modern and elegant London hotel, and also appreciate a genuinely friendly attitude from efficient staff. The location is super, on the south bank, away from the usual unlively hotel areas. The view of the river and the Houses of Parliament is splendid. The rooms are wonderfully comfortable and the breakfast has everything one could want from an English establishment. We will be back soon!"
222,1038,"Jan 12 2007 	Stay for the view of House Parliament and Big Ben!	We booked 2 superior rooms included breakfast for 94 GBP as weekend rate deal. It was good value, but the rooms was very small and no view or view of another building or - even worse -face the tracks. The trains are running constantly and all day long. Having feel bad with the view and noise, we up graded it into executive room with view for additional 50 GBP each rooms. And suddenly, our stayed become beautiful and I wished I could have stayed longer. These impressive rooms have stunning views of the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and the London Eye. The Executive room with view was not too big, but it is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities including high-speed Internet, fax &amp; modem points, flat screen televisions, EU/US power sockets, direct dial telephone, a large work desk, mini-bar, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, laptop safe plus movie &amp; music channels on demand.As Executive level guess, we got benefit from having exclusive access to the Executive lounge on the 11th floor with complimentary breakfast, all day refreshments and evening drinks and snacks. The breakfast has not much option and the service just everage. Compare to St James Sofitel breakfast, our previous days stay, it was not comparable.If we ever go back to London, I would stay at this hotel again, but I would like to stay at the room with view."
223,1038,"Jan 9 2007 	room ok but customer service less than acceptable	The person on the phone from the hotel gave us the wrong directions to the hotel and it took us a lot longer than it should have. In the end we had to get a taxi. (they should have stressed that there are 2 tate galleries, we did not know!) if they did not know they should have passed us on to someone that did know.So we got there too late for drinks/ nibbles included in 'executive' package. Something to watch out for.. you get 1 hour of internet on exec package. We asked at reception and logged on to internet on tv for half an hour and found the next day they wanted to charge us 4.95 which made me quite cross. (cannot remember exact amount but it was about five pounds) apparently i hour is for Wireless. If I stayed again I would not get executive package.Bar staff in hotel bar were moody and receptionists not much better. The words that spring to mind at the time were 'computer says no' !"
224,1038,"Jan 8 2007 	Superb.	This is a first class hotel. The location is excellent, about 5 mins stroll from Vauxhall tube. The room was excellent, we had an executive room, but no river view. Breakfast was great. We didn't fancy the menu for an evening meal, but on the way to the tube is a fab Portuguese restaurant called Pico, great value!If I had to pick a bad point it would be that we had no robes in our room on arrival and had to ask for them. Thats it, everything else was just as you would like it to be."
225,1038,Jan 8 2007 	GEt what you pay for	Location was my main problem as it is a good 5-10 min walk from vauxall station and about a mile and a half to all the sights like Westminster - would have preferred to be more central Staff were really nice and the rooms were really clean and well decorated. Downside was the occasional noise from trains even though I was quite far from the rear of the building. Noise from neighbouring rooms was pretty bad- especially when they are having [--]!!I honestly would try to stay elsewhere if in London again but as a secret hotel on last minute.com its not that bad
226,1038,"Jan 8 2007 	Could not fault anything	Stayed at the this hotel for one night and I wished I could have stayed longer. Booked directly the day before and having done the usual searches found it cheaper to actually book direct with hotel. There was nothing I could fault. Check in was quick and friendly. The room (double) was ultra clean and modern, bed and bedding extra comfy. In room safe, tea/coffee making facilities, iron and board, flat screen TV, DVD, internet access etc. Black and white bathroom with walkin shower AND seperate bath. Bar tastefully decorated - very modern with low lighting/leather seating/fresh flowers and waiter service. Unable to comment on the restaurant as we did not eat there. Having said that if we go back (and I am sure we will) I would like to sample the food. One thing that I was very pleased about was the late check out - 12 o'clock. This meant we could have a bit of a lay-in instead of the mad dash to shower/dress and out by 10! Check out was quick and easy and the walk to Waterloo Station took us 10 minutes along the embankment. I would definatly recommend this hotel."
227,1038,"Jan 2 2007 	Good Enough	We stayed at the Riverbank during Christmas week and were impressed with the decor of this hotel. The rooms were very clean and the maids did a great job everyday.We upgraded to a bigger bed, however, the room was still small. I was very concerned about previous reviews which indicated that Vauxhall Tube Station was a good 15 minute walk. This is true, however, there is a bus stop just outside the front of the hotel which takes you right to the Tube station....I could not believe no one else mentioned this. It was so easy. Take the 77 or the 344 bus and when you are coming back to the hotel...get off at Vauxhall and walk to Bus Stop &quot;J&quot;, and the bus will drop you off right in front of the hotel.The breakfast was decent....not really worth 25 extra pounds per night....it would probably be cheaper to buy it separately. Internet is not free....do not get the in room internet, the keyboard is horrible and very hard to navigate and get anything productive done. The business center charges 4.95 pounds per hour to use their computers.If we ever go back to London, I would stay at this hotel again. The service was good. Rooms were clean. At night, it was quiet. It is appropriate for families as well."
228,1038,"Jan 2 2007 	I Work in the Hotel Business	We just got back from our stay at the River Bank Park Plaza. I work at a top Las Vegas strip hotel as a customer service representative, so I know the hotel business. Do yourself a favor and DO stay at this hotel. First and foremost, the service is absolutely FIRST CLASS. Our every need and concern were attended to professionally and in a timely manner. (Another review expressed dissatisfaction with the staff. They must have been staying at a different hotel! The service could not have been better! Perhaps it was the way they interacted with the workers, but it was as good a service as one can find. They were not aware that I'm in the hotel business, by the way.) The hotel is situated right on the Thames. Our room had a fantastic view of the river, The Eye and Big Ben. The room is superb. The bed is comfortable, good sheets and all of the up-to-date amenities one would expect to find. The entire property was new, modern and extremely clean. There is a cool, hip bar. It's very close to the Underground. We could not have asked for anything better. River Bank Park Plaza will DEFINATELY be our choice for our next stay in London!"
229,1038,"Dec 31 2006 	Great hotel	We stayed in Riverbank Park Plaza for two nights and paid $370 including taxes. Great value!!! The hotel is on the Thames, 15 minutes from Big Ben and London Eye on foot.The hotel is modern with the usual amenities available at a 4-star hotel. At $185 per night in London, given the location and the room, it was a great value.The bathroom was great - both a tub and a shower stall."
230,1038,"Dec 31 2006 	TOP HOTEL	We went to London for a few days break between christmas &amp; new year &amp; decided to book the Riverbank Plaza after staying at another Park Plaza hotel in Cardiff.We found that hotel excellent &amp; thought the Riverbank must be as good. How right we were !The hotel is 1st class. Its situated slightly out of the centre of London but its only a 5 taxi ride away or a 10 minute tube. The nearest tube station is Vauxhall &amp; the hotel is a 5 minute walk from there. There isnt much around the hotel apart from a few bars &amp; shops, but its situated on the river front with excellent views of the Thames, Houses of parliament &amp; the London eye.The hotel is very modern &amp; trendy(typical of the Park Plaza hotels).The bar &amp; restaurant looked great but we were out so much that we didn't get a chance to sample them,so we can't really comment on the food etc. However there were always plenty of people in them.The staff were very friendly &amp; helpful &amp; the concierge will bend over backwards to help you. We just booked a standard room which was very reasonable for the rating of the hotel.We didn't have a river view but if you paid extra you could have a river view.But because we were out so much,by the time we got back it was dark,so didn't think a view was neccessary this time. The room was very clean &amp; trendy,with a seperate bath &amp; shower, LCD TV,Air con etc.If you rang room service they were there within 5 or 10 minutes. We highly recommend this hotel &amp; would definately stay there again."
231,1038,"Dec 30 2006 	absolute first class	Stayed at this hotel just once and what a treat. Really great rooms and if you are lucky will have a view of the Thames and Parliament. A Very nice hotel which I would recommend to anyone. I will return, A lovely walk along the south embankement to Westminster Bridge. Also saw Lisa Riley at Check out!"
232,1038,Dec 30 2006 	Good rooms bad service	This is a stylish hotel with a nice bar. Good location. The executive rooms with a view are big and beautiful. The standard rooms could look directly into another building or - even worse -face the tracks. The trains are running constantly and all day long. The big problem of this hotel is the service on all levels. Most of the staff is friendly but nobody really cares. Many of them are simlpy unprofessional or untrained. One example: We stayed over Christmas and we knew that their restaurants would shut down for three (!) days the night before. By chance. You get informations in small pieces - if you get them. I would only recommend this hotel if you book an executive room with a view and if you can take care of yourself. If you like hotels in which the staff is polite and greeting you and taking care of your needs this is not your hotel. All in all we enjoyed our stay but we will not come back.
233,1038,"Dec 13 2006 	Fantastic stay at The Riverbank Park Plaza	I dont know where to begin..I booked the Riverbank Park Plaza for my sisters 21st Birthday last weekend and can honestly say it was one of the greatest weekends Ive ever had. We booked 3 River facing executive rooms and one Riverbank Suite for 8 of us. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly doorman who pointed us in the direction of reception. We had to queue for 10 minutes but this was only because a coach had just arrived. A very friendly trainee checked us and gave us our keys to our rooms. The rooms were absolutely fabulous as were the bathrooms  separate shower cubicle as well as bath. Our Suite had a separate lounge area which was extremely spacious but best of all were the views!!! We were extremely lucky to have blue sky and sunshine even if it was a bit cold. Every room had clear views across the Houses of Parliament and down towards the London Eye  it was fabulous and well worth the upgrade fee. I believe the back rooms of the hotel overlook the train tracks into Waterloo so if you can afford the upgrade its well worth it.The hotel itself was very modern and beautifully decorated  Before going out for the evening we had a drink in the bar and the bar staff were lovely. Breakfast the following morning was superb.a huge selection from fruit, pastries, yogurts, cereal, and of course hot full English.As it was my sisters birthday we organised for the hotel to make a cake which weve all said was the best chocolate cake weve ever tasted.utter heaven!!! So if its a special occasion then definitely request the hotel to make a cake  it was worth every penny.Lastly one of the best attributes of the hotel is the Guest Relations Manager Albert. I contacted him prior to my arrival and he was the most helpful accommodating member of staff that just made the weekend extra special.I would recommend this hotel to anybody of any age. It was only a 5.60 for a black cab from Waterloo and 10.20 over the river to Piccadilly Circus so fantastically situated. If you fancy a brisk walk Sunday morning after breakfast then I strongly recommend coming out the hotel  turn right out the hotel and when you get to the bridge 50 yards in front of you walk down the steps so you are next to the river. Continue to walk along the river past the London Eye, The Tate Modern all the way to Borough Market and continue up to Tower Bridge  Its a fabulous walk. If you dont fancy the walk back then jump on the speed boat for 4.30 back and get off at Tate Britain which is opposite the hotel on the other side of the river and just walk over the bridge  This walk made our weekend complete!!!I cant wait to return back to the hotel."
234,1038,"Dec 12 2006 	Fantastic Service	Booked Hotel on Last minute web site and have to say that the service we received from all staff was excellent. Check in was quick and efficient and they also allowed us to check in at 10:00 am. Room was clean and trendy with a view of the river. All facilities were excellent, especially meal in club lounge, which was very reasonably priced. Location of hotel was also good and with just a 15 minute stroll you are in the centre of most things. Would recommend hotel to friends and will definitley stay there again."
235,1038,"Dec 4 2006 	Executive upgrade made all the difference	Situated just across Lambeth Bridge and opposite the Houses of Parliament this hotel is in a prime location to take in probably the most well known building in the world! Great if you can get one of the suites overlooking the Thames, maybe not so good if your room is at the back of the hotel overlooking the the eight-track rail line.Our room was at the back of the hotel and, although we could hear the trains passing, it did not disturb us. We travelled to the hotel by car for a weekend stay. Overnight parking is 26. Check-in was extremely busy on our arrival and it did take quite awhile to get through the process. We booked through Priceline and got a good deal with their 'Name your own price'. The hotel offerred us a 25 upgrade 'executive package'. This included, special toiletries, robes, slippers, fruit, complimentary canapes and wine/beer in the 11th Floor Executive Lounge (between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. ) and complimentary breakfast - at 12.50 each we found this excellent value.The room was stylish and modern with quite a large bathroom. It was good to have a separate shower but the absence of a bidet let it down slightly. There seemed to be a problem with the hot water during our stay, it took to an age to come even luke warm and I am not sure it would have been hot enough to have a bath.Overall a good stay at the price we paid - not sure I would want to pay the full price though."
236,1038,"Nov 28 2006 	Very Poor Service for a 4 star hotel 	Very pokey room ( executive room )....and service with a smile does not come natural to this hotel, even when you tip the staff !....the front desk was a nightmare on check-in....disgruntled guest from Cambridge UK."
237,1038,"Nov 27 2006 	Great Modern Hotel	We didn't actually book this hotel but were changed here from the Sherlock Holmes Hotel last minute.The hotel itself is great, very modern, the staff are very helpful, the room was very big etc but from our point of view the location let it down.We had booked the other hotel due to the central location.. unfortunately something which can't be said for this hotel. The nearest tube station is Vauxhall which is a good 15 minutes walk away... not great in the rain! We had to get taxis in the evening which is expensive.. especially when you hadn't planned for it!Overall this is a great hotel as long as you don't mind being South of the River. I'm sure the river view rooms are great but unfortuatnely we didn't get one!"
238,1038,Nov 21 2006 	Best Customer Service !!!	I have stay in Riverbank last week and had a very bad start with a water leake in my room but Cedrik the duty manager apologise and room move us to a Suite with amazing view to the river and that definatly made up for it and even better after 45min some one knock at the door it was room service with a complimentary bottle of wine and an apologise letter for the inconvenience from Cedrik with is direct number in case we need anything. We are definatly coming back to Riverbank on our next trip to the UK. Highly recommended.
239,1038,"Nov 20 2006 	Excellent Visitors from Western Australia	We my partner and I arrived on the 6th August for five days and were treated with the upmost respect by all staff. Our room was at the right side and we could see the river. We did not have any noise at all. Room was on the 3rd floor,big and very clean. On the Thursday the terriorist threat happened and the Conceirge Joe and his staff were excellent. Well done Guys. They pulled out all stops to help as I was flying to Vienna next morning and not sure if I had a plane. We were able to leave luggage also with Joe and his Staff.But on the return trip two weeks later the office front staff were so stressed and not experienced that it made it so hard to get back in. Far too many people trying to book in and they were rude to staff. Our room was not ready and we had two nights in two separate tickets. They the office staff made a mess of the booking, which really made it not nice.Meals were excellent and the breakfasts were great.We would stay there again and found it was easy to catch a train or bus as we liked to walk so 10 minutes did not worry us."
240,1038,"Nov 15 2006 	great if you like trains	The hotel looked great and was suprised to be upgraded to a suite. The suite was excellent with a lovely bathroom. I was overlooking the train lines but thought I was safe on the 10th floor. at 0420 the following morning the trains started running and continued nonstop, this ruined the experience for me.the breakfast the following morning was poor and the wait for a table was not acceptable.Due to the noise outside I will not be staying again"
241,1038,"Nov 13 2006 	Amazing hotel!!	I felt I should add a review here after reading so many and finally using the ones I read about this hotel to make my booking.I have to say that me and my girlfriend have just spent Saturday night (Nov 06) in the Riverbank Plaza and the experience was amazing. The hotel is immaculate and very smart, well designed and decorated. I took peoples advice to book a River view room early and we were very lucky as im sure we were given one of the best rooms in the hotel! We were on the 10th floor and the view was nothing less than amazing!! (ive attached a pic). The room is very contemporary and is very plush with a comfy bed, lcd tv and great bathroom.The check in desk was a little slow, but when serving they were very helpful. The concierge was extremly helpful and phoned over 20 restuaraunts trying to help me get dinner reservations!I think that anyone who wants a quiet hotel in central London is a bit mad! This hotel was far from noisy but you should always expect a bit of noise in this sort of area. Personally we had a great nights sleep.I think you get what you pay for, and this room was certainly not cheap, but it was an amazing experience and I would highly reccomend it to anyone."
242,1038,"Nov 7 2006	Bad experience	I booked a guarnteed river view room directly from the hotel for eight nights and paid an extra amount to have the view. When I checked in, the front desk told methat they are fully booked and they don't have available river view room!! I replied that my reservation was guarnteed and what is the meaning of GUARANTEE!!!! They promised to get me one in the morning and offered me a nice looking suite but I couldn't get rest because it was just over the railways and trains are passing by every minute, it was really NOISY. In the morning they found a river view room for me and promised to move my bags to the new room. They didn't, I moved them after they gave me the room in the afternoon!I think the building wasn't designed to be a hotel because you will feel and hear every movement not only in the room above you ut the whole floor above you and the rooms next to yours. That was it. I checked out after my second night in the hotel instead of EIGHT nights. The hotel front desk didn't even bother to ask WHY?Actually, I heard too many people complaining to the front desk representatives and it was really significant.To be fair, here are the pros and Cons:Pros:1- great view with only river view rooms (ONLY)2- nicely decoratedCons:1- badly managed2- noise comes from everywhere3- location (nothing nearby, no stores or resturants)4- transportation (specially if you use buses)5- over priced"
243,1038,"Oct 30 2006 	Sylish Hotel on Thames	Booked a secret deal lastminute thought the review section named the restaurant so with a web search we found the name of the secret hotel. We were slow checking in the early afternoon even with 5 staff on the receptions, just a timing issue. The Executive double room on 11th was nice stylish and the usual small size of modern hotels. Comfortable bed, good TV, ironing board in the cupboard and tea/coffee selction available. The bathroom was excellant -clean and fresh -with separate shower and bathWe were missing the freebie items which we reported and they were duely there when we returned. Also the room had been set to very cold with the AC, not necessary and environmently friendly for this conscienious age.The bar downstair is trendy and quietly busy, but expensive even for London. Breakfast was nice, not too busy as most people don't have it included. Continental seclection was good but not as vaired as some. The Full english was ok, though the fried eggs were not properly cooked on top which is sloppy. Our tea and coffee did not come immediately, we had to ask twice more and no-one offered us toast which we had to request.Location was excellant, with a travel card the buses to Vauxhall or Waterloo were regular, opposite was the old Tate museum with it's clipper service downriver. Okay, not dead centre but who wants to be near all that noise and so many people. Definately a relaxing hotel and very plesant, and we would go again."
244,1038,"Oct 29 2006 	best thing to happen to Vauxhall	I work in the Vauxhall area and have used the Riverbank Park Plaza for numerous work related and social events. I remember when it opened there were a LOT of start up hitches with the staff and service levels - not many people who stayed there from my office were impressed. Some of their issues, which have already been raised such as proximity to rail tracks I doubt have disappeared. However, I have always been lucky enough to get a riverview room, so have enjoyed the brilliant views like others and missed out on the bad side. The executive lounge is nothing special as a room, but it is nice to have a quiet area outside of your room to read the paper, have a drink - complimentary beer/wine/cheese in the evenings. The bar is extraordinarily expensive, even by London standards but the good news is there are a few good pubs, bars and restaurants in the area now. On the walk from the hotel to Vauxhall tube you have Madeiras Bakery &amp; Cafe, an Italian wine bar that does good, cheap pastas, Pico Bar &amp; grill - fantastic for Tapas &amp; Sagres, one street back you have the Lavender Pub (down the street between the petrol station &amp; Maderia) which has a relaxed atmosphere and good gastro food. There are also now a couple of gay clubs and bars in the area. I've always founf the staff helpful and frienly at the RBP be it for business or leisure."
245,1038,"Oct 24 2006 	The perfect choice!!!!	We stayed at the Riverbank last weekend. And I have to say, after staying in London for so many times, I was overwhelmed with what we got for 90 Punds per night. A very cool and comfortable room that was absolutely quiet, a huge and clean bathroom with luxurious amenities. And despite some negative reviews about the service, we had a warm and professional welcome and were treated more than nicely. There was no queue at check-in and check-out and both took less than five minutes... If I came back?? Definitely. Stayed at &quot;grand&quot; hotels such as Park Lane Hilton, Park Lane Sheraton and the Millennium Hotels before, but no one was as good as the Riverbank Park Plaza."
246,1038,"Oct 24 2006	very modern / good hotel	this hotel is spotless clean , luxury surroundings nice big bedroom and bathroom bedding and towel spotlessly white and clean , drink in hotel bar expencive , choice at breakfast not as good as some hotels i,ve stopped in . but over all this is a great hotel. i will definitely return here ."
247,1038,"Oct 22 2006 	A great contempory Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for one night on business back in June. I have nothing but praise for it, it is a new hotel so everything is very clean and modern.The room has a plasma tv and the bathroom is spotless.The bar is great and the restaurant serves great food."
248,1038,"Oct 22 2006	Pretty good but not for tall folks	Stayed here the first 2 nights of a Trafalgar Tour. Checkin was confusing as they did not seem to understand that my partner (male) and I wanted 1 room together. Hey, this is London in 2006, isn't it? The hotel was nice, though we ended up with a room on the 1st floor that faced the railway tracks. One odd design note (at least, I thought it odd): the ceilings were noticeably low--about 7 ft [2.1m]--in most of the hallways and rooms of the place, which made it seem a bit cramped. Not a good place to stay if you're tall, I'd say. The other major complaint was the dismal state of the exercise room. It looked like someone was in the midst of setting it up when the hotel was being built, and then forgot to finish the job. Location was OK, though rather a long walk to a tube station. The lobby lounge looked good, but was too smoky to enjoy (such is most of Europe). At least there is a small food market a short walk from the hotel's front door, which was a plus for us jet-lagged Californians. Oh, and the television *is* rather confusing--it has to boot up like a computer before you see anything on-screen--but we did manage to figure it out. Our card keys had to be re-coded after the first night, which was another technical glitch."
249,1038,"Oct 17 2006 	Nice but the tellies don't work	I stayed here twice over the past fortnight in different rooms each time. The rooms are spotless and modern rather than the chintzy, frilly nylon sheets look of many London hotels in this price bracket. Call me a philistine but the &quot;art&quot; works around the place are unusually trippy - I had a painting of a 7ft doll carrying a snarling lapdog in one room -glad I didn't have a hangover. A 6ft green umbrella had pride of place in the second room... The staff are really friendly and the breakfast is great. The one problem I had both times is that the TV doesn't work. There seems to be a design fault with the cables which cut out or just don't work at all. Its all very well having a posh flatscreen TV with internet access but if it doesn't switch on you are sat waiting for the repair man for a couple of hours staring at the four walls. In 2 stays I've met the TV repair man 5 times in total. I feel like I'm stalking the poor guy. So, if you're going out on the town then stay here but if you're having a night in go elsewhere where they have a working telly."
250,1038,"Oct 16 2006	Great hotel highly recommended	Stayed for one night at this hotel. I've stayed at other hotels in the same chain and this one was just as good as the others.Check in at the hotel was chaos when we arrived, they were ill equipped to cope with two coaches, however when I checked in later the staff were attentive and friendly. Our room was on the 4th floor, no particular view although you could see the river and the railway line. The railway line didn't cause any disturbance although it could be heard. Beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom was fantastic, and a good choice of TV channels.I loved the location being out of the city and on the riverbank, within easy walking distance of the attractions of the southbank. Although appreciate comments that apart from the hotel there are few shops or places to eat in the area. There was a good selection of food at breakfast and it was always well stocked. The staff were all polite and generally the hotel was very clean.A good place for a London city break. Although I think room location within the hotel could affect your opinion. Other people in our party experienced road noise, railway noise, or music until late from the function rooms."
251,1038,Oct 11 2006	Nice!!!!	Once again the Riverbank Park Plaza was a perfect choice in London. Good service and a big great room with a view to kill for.. Second time at the property and I will come back!
252,1038,"Oct 2 2006 	Great Value Great Hotel	We booked the Riverbank as it was close to our dinner engagement, didn't expect much, just wanted a bed for the night.How pleased we were to have that view! Looking East along the Thames, London Eye to right, Westminster Palace to left, stunning!!!We paid 139 for room, parking and breakfast - although I think they got that a bit wrong, they do seem to have their fair share of new people at the front desk.A bottle of champagne (Perrier Jouet) only 40 at the bar - Chino Latino - the bar snack menu is superb and good value.Don't bother with club lounge on 11th floor, if you must, then check it out before you pay, it's not worth it!When I go back I'll do a deal on the parking with the doorman - Stephen - as most people were slipping cash to him rather than paying the 26/day fee.Highly recommended."
253,1038,"Sep 25 2006 	Serious staff issues	The front desk staff at this hotel are the worst I have come across in many years. The initial person I approached upon arrival flat out refused to check me in (despite having nothing to do), telling me I had to see her colleague at the other end of the desk, who had a queue of people waiting in front of her. Both women were rude with questionable English-language skills. The whole check-in procedure was unnecessarily lengthy and inefficient. Check-out was painfully slow as well and was carried out with no hint of customer-facing friendliness, no questions as to whether the stay was alright, no smiles, nothing, as if it was all too much of a bother for them. The actual room (away from the train tracks) was fine, nice sleek bathroom, comfortable beds etc. The location is excellent, 5 min walk to Vauxhall tube. It's reasonable value for money paid. However the whole enterprise is seriously let down by the utterly incapable and inefficient staff. There are better options in this part of town at the same price."
254,1038,"Sep 17 2006	Nice Hotel mediocre location 	The hotel was clean &amp; located in what seemed to be a safe and reasonably convenient area for sightseeing (near Parliament &amp; Westminister Cathedral). To prevent the room from smelling like mildew always leave the air conditioning on. From the American perspective, I did'nt think communication would be as difficult as it turned out to be; English obviously was not the primary language of most of the hotel staff (or for many of the service workers in London for that matter). Another nit is the food available in London. While the hotel room service was timely and the room service staff were polite, it's advisable to ask what is included in the selections (a club sandwich included cajun chicken, mustard &amp; a fried egg). The salads, while not plentiful, were not bad (only one, unfamilar dressing was available) and the chicken was acceptable, but all the beef related products had an unusual taste (possibly due to grass fed vs corn fed cows). In addition to not being satisfying, the food was expensive. Also, be advised that EVERYTHING in London seems to close by six PM."
255,1038,"Sep 15 2006 	Hotel 4 star the staff 2 star	The building is beautiful, but most room do not face the river. The front desk was staffed with trainees that needed help.The bus boys are the concierge they are helpful but not professional with giving help about town. The room maid did not replace a tissue box when she was left an empty one (she removed it). The breakfast is a joke, high price and poorly cooked. There is a food store just to the right as you go out the door. Location is very good, you can walk to many things or take a bus across the street."
256,1038,"Sep 13 2006	Fantastic view	Stayed in one of the rooms with a view over the river thame, fantastic. Great ambience and friendly staff and very funky main bar as well. Will definately come back again."
257,1038,"Sep 12 2006 	Very Nice Hotel	We stayed in this hotel for two nights, once at the beginning of our trip to France/Belgium, and once at the end. We chose the hotel because of it's proximity to Waterloo Station and the Eurostar. The first night was a &quot;getaway&quot; package which included breakfast and a bottle of wine for something like 89 pounds, while the second night was a AAA rate of 79 pounds with no breakfast.The hotel is very new and quite nice! The staff was friendly and the check-in/check-out process was smooth and expedient. The hotel (including the bar/restaurant) itself has a very modern, &quot;chic&quot; feel to it.Our room seemed relatively spacious for European standards, we had room for our luggage (two big suitcases), and there was a desk next the bed and a very small sitting area. The flat screen TV was nice and offered a fair number of channels. The bed was very comfortable and both of our rooms were VERY quiet. I'm a light sleeper to begin with and normally wear earplugs when traveling, but I didn't have to in this hotel. I had read some of the reviews which stated that the rooms facing the train tracks may be noisly, so I requested rooms that did not face them. Both of our rooms face the interior of the hotel (windows looked onto other rooms with a small &quot;atrium&quot; open to the sky for light) and were very quiet, so I was pleasantly surprised.There are virtually no restaurants/hotels in immediate proximity, and the closest tube station (Vauxhall) is about a 5-10 minute walk. However, this was ok for us. It's right across the street from the Thames, and just a short ways down from Parliament, so the view at night is very nice!We walked to/from Waterloo station, about 15 minutes, along the river at night and felt relatively safe (warranted or not). You basically walk towards the London Eye, then head away from the river a block to Waterloo. It's a nice, scenic walk on the river.Overall, a very nice hotel and a reasonable price for London. If you want something clean and modern, and don't mind walking to get to restaurants, this is a great hotel with a nice view!"
258,1038,"Sep 10 2006 	One night at the RIverbank	Got this hotel on Priceline for $150 including taxes (but no breakfast) for one night based on proximity to Victoria station for our early morning trip to Gatwick. Our room was very clean and spacious. The bedding and pillows were exceptionally comfortable. Hotel was filled with tour groups and it was a little noisy in the evening and the line to check out in the morning was really long. Pretty setting, but not as convenient to Underground and smaller neighborhood restaurants as other hotels we've stayed in."
259,1038,"Sep 8 2006	Good Value But Not Impressive Hotel	This hotel is well situated - a 15 minute walk from Waterloo station. It also is very affordable for London and the rooms are very modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms also have very nice new washrooms. The basic rooms are what you would expect from a higher end hotel.In all honesty, I think you get more than you pay for with these rooms. I paid about 115 pounds for a standard room.My criticism of the hotel is the check-in and check-out staff are very slow and give off a snootiness that one would expect at the Ritz. The problem here, however, is that this hotel isn't the Ritz and you get the distinct feeling they don't really care about you.I specifically asked if they could please give me a room that was away from the train tracks that run passed the back of the hotel. Given that I had a basic room, they could have said &quot;no sorry we can't do that with your room.&quot; But instead, they said &quot;sure no problem&quot; and then proceeded to give me a room right by the train tracks. If a hotel tells me they are going to do something for me, I expect it to be done. I was exhausted and only staying overnight so I left the issue alone. Also, there is nobody in front of the hotel (at least not that I saw) to help with luggage or hail taxis for you. In addition, once I found a doorman and asked for a taxi to which he replied &quot;oh the hotel has a VIP car service that we offer and our driver is right over here and he'll take you there right away.&quot; I declined initially as I thought it would be quite expensive and all I needed was a basic taxi. The doorman said &quot;no please take our VIP car - it's the same as a taxi except it's here right now and no need to wait for a taxi.&quot; I figured this was the Park Plaza so if they said they offer this comparable taxi service than I was comfortable in believing them. Not surprisingly, it turns out they charged me about 50% more than a taxi - charged me a seemingly random flat rate - no taxi meter in the car. Given that I asked for a taxi and they told me this service was the same thing, I was not impressed that they tried to take me for a ride of a different kind. It was only a few extra pounds that they charged me, but I planned on complaining to management upon my return. Too bad the counter was so busy - I again gave up and just accepted it but I'm not impressed with this hotel's service. But it is a good deal for the room you get."

Excellent service, courteous staff, lovely rooms.Breakfast was exellent, with lots of choice.5-10 minutes walk away from Westminster bridge.Had a room over the railway line initially but was moved to a quieter room the next day, an upgraded room too with bath and walk in shower!! Would definately stay here again.Excellent base for exploring London.Shame there was no view of the Thames but wasn't really expecting one, not without paying the 50.00 per night supplement!!!Overall very good."
261,1038,"Aug 28 2006 	Good for me but.........	I recently stayed at this hotel in a River View Excecutive Room which had fantastic views of Big Ben, Houses of Parliment, London Eye and also the river. The room was fantastic and the view even better- must be one of the best &quot;Rooms with a view&quot; in London.The hotel is only a short walk from Vauxhall tube and there is a garage very close to the hotel with an off license which sells wine, beer and spirits a lot cheaper than using the mini barHad a meal in Hotel Restaurant, Chino Latino - excellent food and cocktails but very expensive. Breakfast is OK served buffet style.Now comes my gripe. Reception staff and checking in and out proceedures are poor. They took my credit card details and insisted that I pre -signed for an extra 25 a day for extras which would be adjusted up or down at checkout. First time I have experienced this. This proceedure was causing chaos at check in with other people. My room was assigned but was not ready. When I returned to the hotel after the theatre my key was presented by reception staff. I then found the key would not open my assigned room- trudging back down to reception it took some time to find out they had put some other people in my room and reassigned a different room of the same catorgary to me whilst I was out!On checkout it took numerous attempts, and a great deal of time to get the bill correct. I have never come across so many people complaining about room types, incorrect rates and poor service at checkout - quite amazing. Most of these people were asking to speak to the Duty Manager as they were frustrated, as I was, with the reception staff.This is a very good hotel that is being spoilt by poor reception service and proceedures, A lot of it is down to training and administration proceedures but it needs sorting and quickly as it will affect the reputation of a good hotel"
262,1038,"Aug 28 2006 	4 star hotel 2 star service	Stayed for two nights having booked through the hotel website. Firstly, the standard (though they call them superior) room was excellent. Nice decor, clean bathroom with bath and seperate shower, comfy bed and pillows, large lcd tv with dvd player. Location was fine - only 10-15 mins walk to the London eye then another 10 mins to Trafalgar Square. However, housekeeping was appauling. Firstly, we rang down on four occasions to get tea, coffee, sugar etc .. restocked as this was not topped up. Secondly, piles of laundry were left in the corridor for 24 hours +. Breakfast, by any standards was poor. Not a great selection, not very well cooked and not very hot! 13 for continental or 17 for full english is a bit of a rip off! Lastly, though it says about some rooms with river views on the website, we were told that no superior rooms have river views (unless you pay a 25 upgrade). Overall a 4 star hotel but 2 star service .. thus an inbetween 3 star review."
263,1038,"Aug 21 2006	brilliant	Great hotel, good location, friendly helpful staffdefinately use again"
264,1038,"Aug 16 2006 	Modern comfortable hotel	I booked this as a last minute city break so was nicely surpised on arrival at the standard of the hotel for the price we had paid. The room we were allocated was not at the front of the hotel sadly :o( - (in fact I'm not quite sure where it was)!! Not at the back facing the railway lines anyway (thank goodness as it was very noisy in the corridors at the windows that looked onto these). We looked into other rooms within the hotel but it was quiet. Plenty of fast lifts with hardly any waiting to get you wherever you need to go in the building.The rooms are fantastic, clean and spacious, very modern up to the minute with detail and content as was the bathroom. The bed was so comfortable as soon as you lay down on the mountain of incredibly soft pillows it was hard not to drift off. They have everything you would need to enjoy your stay, choice of several TV channels, internet access, pay to view movies etc etc. Tea/ coffee making facilities, hairdryer, hangers, safe, notepaper and other little surprises like travel sewing kit, an iron and board - not a steam iron so make sure your clothes are packed well ironed so it's only travel creases you need to get rid off. Room was cleaned/made up on a daily basis at times that were convenient to us.Breakfast was plentiful no matter what time you arrive - served buffet style with something for everyones taste.5-10 minute walk to Vauxhall Train Station and 5-10 min walk to the London Eye in opposite direction with great views of Big Ben and Houses of Parliment on the way.Excellent choice of hotel if you want to be somewhere quiet but close enough to the city.Only one minor complaint - it was a trainee who I spoke to at the check-in desk and I think she could have made more of an effort as she was my first contact (being a trainee I would have expected more enthusiasm and maybe a smile) but I'm sure the management are in control of that - the rest of the staff were so polite and helpful, we couldn't fault them in any way.Overall lovely stay."
265,1038,"Aug 11 2006 	nice hotel bad location	my husband i stayed at the riverbank park plaza for one night. the hotel is very new and modern, and the room was spacious as was the bathroom. however, we had a horrible view of train tracks and a parking garage (?) so make sure you request a room with a view if you plan on staying here. the lady who checked us in was a bit snooty (you'd think someone who is in traning would be friendlier) but otherwise everyone else seemed nice. my biggest complaint is the location of this hotel. my husband and i arrived at our hotel from heathrow via the tube and it was quite a walk from the vauxhall tube station. it's true that you have a great view of westminster and big ben from the front of the hotel but i would not recommend this hotel for tourists (esp first-timers) soley because of the location. you'd waste too much time getting from one place to the other.there were a lot of businessmen at the hotel and that's probably who it's best suited for."
266,1038,"Aug 7 2006 	Excellent for Business	I was really impressed with the value for this hotel. It's very modern, high tech, has satellite LCD TV and beautiful artwork in the rooms. The room service was good, the staff was very good, location is near a lot of the major sites. A big plus for me is that there was a little grocery / convenience store next door. I had breakfast included in my rate and the breakfast had a good selection.Though it's primarily a business hotel, I'd be happy to bring my family there."
267,1038,"Aug 5 2006 	Loved this hotel!	I got a great rate through an online travel site. We were only scheduled to be there for one night in early July, but as soon as we saw the hotel, we booked it for our return trip to London the following weekend. They even gave us the same discounted rate for the following weekend- about $129/night including breakfast (excluding taxes). The hotel was clean, modern, and well-decorated. The rooms were large and comfortable and the bathrooms were also large, spotless, and modern. The location was great- only a 10-minute walk to the Vauxhall underground station. The staff was generally very professional and helpful. The only problem we had was with the concierge staff through whom we booked a day trip to Stonehenge. Although the hotel appears to have a relationship with one of the tour companies, the concierge didn't seem very knowledgeable about the tour company or the trips it offered. We booked the trip anyway for the next day, our last day in London. Unfortunately, the shuttle provided by the tour company left the hotel before the scheduled departure time and when we asked if that was our bus, the concierge told us it was not our bus. Well, it was and the bus left without us! The concierge that morning, who barely spoke English, had our names and should have made sure the bus didn't leave without us. Instead, he told the driver that we weren't there, even though we were in the lobby waiting! When we asked a second time about the bus, we were told that that was our bus. Then he told us to take a taxi to Victoria Station at our expense. We went to Victoria train station, only to learn that the tour buses departed from Victoria Coach station a couple blocks away. We missed our bus and never got to see Stonehenge thanks to the concierge with limited English proficiency."
268,1038,"Jul 30 2006 	Loved the unscheduled wake up call at 5.45 a.m	It's a shame we couldn't give it a 0. The riverview room we booked was given to VIPs (nice to see that all customers are treated equally)... despite the hotel promising us a river view room on 3 occasions.Furthermore, we asked numerous times for our mini-bar to be opened. Each time we were promised that our mini-bar would be opened electronically. It was never opened.Finally, we were woken up on our final morning (my birthday, as it happens) at 5.45 a.m (unscheduled) by hotel security saying there was a 'Fire alert' in our room. There was no such alert but most annoyingly there was no word of apology for waking us up.A real shame. I can't believe that people are giving this hotel either 4 or 5 out of 5 when we were constantly dismayed by the level of service."
269,1038,"Jul 29 2006	it was enjoyable.	I stayed at the Park Plaza hotel in London for one night only.I enjoyed my stay, it was in a fine location and had wonderfull views and luxurious rooms. On the negative side I believed that if the hotel had had another resterant it would have been even better. 4/5"
270,1038,"Jul 28 2006	Great hotel if you like walking a bit	The hotel is new and very contemporary. It is very nice, the interior designers did a great job. I had read other Trip Advisor's reviews, so I asked for a &quot;not too nosy&quot; room at the front desk when we arrived. They offered me an upgrade package (50 U$s extra per night includes breakfast and a welcome tray, etc.). Althought I didn't accepted it, the lgirl at the front desk gave us a side room (it wasn't riverview, but it was far from the noisy train tracks at the back). The hotel was really full, so she gave us the handicapped room, that they reserved for disabled passengers.The room was big and comfortable. It has a nice desk, a king size bed, nice decoration, and a good plasma TV. It is real that it takes 5 minutes to understand how to use it, but if you call the front desk, they send you immediatelt somebody who explain it.I have a problem with the safe, and they send me a security clerk very soon too. You really feel very nice treated in this hotel. I read other reviewers complaining about the 50 u$s deposit that they charge when you arrive. The gril at the fornt desk explained it very clear, and they really don't charge your credit card. The other complain was about the automatic charge when you pick something up at the minibar. There is a big sign in the door that explains that, and a fair empty space to acommodate our own groceries, so we had no complain.There is a good grocery store next to the hotel, where you can buy pastries, milk, yoghurt , sandwiches and yummy middle eastern food, in case you are in a low budget. (Eating in London is VERY expensive, believe me).Just one complain: Wi-Fi in the room has a poor signal, and it costs 19 u$s per day! We lost the connection all the time! (The better place to use my laptop was sitting on the toilet!). Althought the nearest tube station (Vauxhall) was 6 blocks walking to the west), I recommend you to enjoy the walk to Westminster station instead. It is 10 blocks to the East, but wyou will enjoy the lovely view of the Big Ben and the Parliament across the Thames River (why you are going to London if you don't want to enjoy that incredible sightseeing?)Last but not least: buy a one day roundtrip ticket in any boat cruise line. Circle line has a hop on-hop off ticket for just 14 u$s (just 5 extra bucks than the tube daily ticket, but you will enjoy sailing across the Thames instead of going underground). You can visit St Paul Cathedral, Tate Modern, Shakespeare' Globe Theatre, Tower of London, Tower bridge and many other attractions in that single day using the boats."
271,1038,Jul 27 2006	Good Hotel	I was rewarded this room through Priceline for 134USD plus tax. It was a good deal. The room was very nice and clean. The man at the front desk couldn't answer any questions but he was training. We had a very early train leaving from Waterloo and the hotel is only a 12 min walk to the train station. It is close enough to walk to most of the main attractions. I would stay here again if I got it for less than 150USD.
272,1038,"Jul 25 2006 	At Last a True 4 *	From the moment we checked in until we checked out everything was perfect. The staff were helpful and polite, the room was a delight and spotlessly clean ( it was just a pity we couldnt have had a river view) and the meal we had in The Club Lounge on Saturday evening was delicious and expertly served. Breakfast the next morning, although very busy, was dealt with in a clam efficient manner by the restaurant staff and to wait was a minor inconvenience.We had booked on a Summer Saver Rate which was excellent value and we werent made to feel we were second class guests (as had happened at SAS Portman Raddison only a few weeks ago). At last we have found a hotel we feel confident to return to again and again and are desperately trying to find a date when we can come back."
273,1038,"Jul 9 2006 	Posh hotel boring neighbourhood	I stayed in this big hotel for work reasons for one night in June. I attended a big conference, so there were many 'business people' staying. I got the impression that this is the case a lot, especially during the week. It makes the hotel less personal, but I don't mind that. The hotel has got very nicely decorated and spacious rooms. The bathroom was beautiful with black marble and also very spacious. It had a bath and seperate shower. My room faced another part of the building and was very quiet. There was a multifunctional telly, you could watch your own dvd's and use the internet on it (5 pounds per day). Although it was a very good hotel, I had booked another hotel for the other two nights that I was staying in London, because I prefer to stay in area's with local shops and restaurants and there are hardly any in the area of the hotel, It's not really a residential neighourhood. Also I thought the hotel is too far away from a underground station (10 minutes to Waterloo station). But if you want a good, convenient hotel that is close to some of the sightseeings of London, I would recommend this hotel (don't know about the price though, but can imagine they do good deals in the weekend. It's worth checking)."
274,1038,"Jul 7 2006	Good and not so good	I stayed a the Riverbank in late June 06. It is new, clean and smart. The only down side is all the rooms facing the rail line are noisy until 12pm and start again at 5am. Trains passed by every 10 to 15 minutes and you can hear them.Even the excecutive suite where we stayed is on the back facing the line and the receptionist said that all the suites are facing the back.To move to the front where the river view and House of Parliament is located they ask for an extra 88 dollars per night. They won't budged even down size to an ordinary room presumably so that they can keep all the front rooms for the 88 dollars up grade.The nearest underground is 10 minutes walk away. Not too bad actually.Taxis are expensive in London. Everywhere you go it cost 15 dollars minimum upwards.If you can be sure to get the front river view rooms then it is a good hotel. When you do get a good rate on some web sites then it is an excellent value for money.Breakfast is not included and expensive. There are a few nice coffee bars 5 minutes away towards the subway at a far cheaper price with good patisery."
275,1038,"Jun 25 2006	great view and service	Beautifully designed rooms. Easy access to Internet. Great breakfast and dinner. Excellent service. Great view over Big Ben and The Parliament. Short walking distance to the Vauxhall Station with fast transports. Also walking distance to the London Eye. Overall a very pleasant stay, which we can highly recommend."
276,1038,"Jun 21 2006	waterloo train line park plaza	This hotel has one major problem, a good numbef of the rooms do not face the riverside as the name suggests, unfortunately they face directly on to the Waterloo Railway main line.This has the effect of giving rooms facing that way, an intolerable noise level until late in the night, and restarting very early in the morning. This ruined oour break away from our young children, and as the hotel uses the riverside to its advantage in both name and description, gets a thumbs down from me"
277,1038,"Jun 16 2006	Modern great amenities great price	I booked a room at the hotel for a long weekend. I took the train from Paris. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from Waterloo station...a nice little stroll along the Thames. The hotel is new and the decor is modern chic. Lots of business travelers here. My room was great. Roomy and well appointed--big, fluffy bed, flat screen tv, dvd player, usual mini bar stuff and a combo plug at the desk. You can use either the British outlet, the Euro outlet or the US outlet. No adaptor needed. Only one Euro outlet and one US outlet, but a nice feature. I used the Euro outlet to plug in my mobile phone charger (phone purchased in France), the British outlet for the hotel hairdryer and the US outlet for my hot rollers while I got ready to go out for a night on the town. The bathroom was wonderful. Big and luxurious. Full sized bath tub and separate shower. I had just walked ALL OVER Paris and my feet were killing me. I had put up with a really small bathroom in Paris, so I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. I got a fantatsic deal on this hotel via one of the online travel sites. I liked the hotel and would stay here again. No doubt about it."
278,1038,"Jun 13 2006 	London in a day...	This was one of the craziest trips I have ever been on. I volunteered to mule an important package to the UK as it was the fastest, cheapest and most reliable way to get this parcel to the UK. I flew from Toronto to London and back to Toronto in forty-one hours.I delivered the parcel to a downtown location and spent the day seeing sites by foot. I pulled into an internet cafe in The West End and searched online for the best deal on London hotels. I like modern and clean. I found this hotel on a popular hotel wholesaler for $200 CAD including tax. That's about 75. I was astonished by the price, the location, the ammenities and the entire package. I booked in realtime and flagged a taxi to cross the river and head to the hotel. I was very pleased by the lobby decor, the St. Germain-esque music in the lobby. The swanky lounge. The check-in attendant had difficulty locating my reseravtion and was then astonished by the rate I had prepaid. He had the manager come to confirm. He wwas aware of the promotion and pleasantly welcomed me to the hotel. I got to the room and it was so clean and comfortable. It took me almost five minutes to determine that the key to the room also engages the power to the lights and television. This is obviously to prevent guests from leaving the lights on while out of their room.The washroom looked virgin. I would have plated and eaten a meal from the sink. The glass doors on the shower look like a nightmare for the housekeepers. I can see a great deal of Windex glass shine being used for the cleaning of these units. The flat screen television was beyond my capability. I was also too tired to use it. I plugged my noteboook into the desk/workstation. I love a hotel that has a dataport and not just wi-fi internet. The power supply was global. There were AC sockets for all international plugs. I brought a converter, but it was a nice touch that I have not encountered elsewhere.My colleagues travel to London often. They stay in Hyde Park at one of the three Hiltons. I told them all about the hotel that I had the pleasure to stay at and they have all vowed to give it a go on their next visit to the city.Great view of The River Thames, Big Ben and Parliament. Could not offer a higher recommendation. I would expect a view of the hotel next door unles you are paying for the higher or top tier of rooms though.TTFN"
279,1038,"Jun 12 2006	Great Modern 	I stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza after a horrible night at the Grange Holburn. Both hotels were the same price but the differences were like night and day. The Riverbank Park Plaza is bright, clean, comfortable, and very modern; the staff were very knowledgeable and hospitable. The bathroom was large with a lounging tub and separate shower. Room service were very polite and efficient. The room had a flat screen tv and available internet service. We didn't get one of those rooms with a view - our view was of the other hotel rooms but we're not complaining. Just make sure you ask for a room with a view if you really want one. There is a bank and a grocery store next door for convenience and the train tube is just a 5 min walk away. I would definitely stay here again!"
280,1038,"Jun 9 2006 	If at first you don't succeed.....ask for another room	I wish that I could rate this hotel solely on the staff. They were some of the most professional I have encountered on my many trips, however, this property has a major flaw. The entire back side of the hotel sits directly over train tracks. The trains run from dawn to past mid-night. Some of the rooms at acturally trackside. On the lower floors, you can literally look inside the cars as they pass. Our first room was on the 3rd floor and we were face to face with each passing train. It would have been impossible to sleep in that room. We did switch, with no problems, to a higher floor on the same side of the building, and it was tolerable. The hotel boasts that its main feature is an awesome view of Parliment, etc. If that is what you want and expect, make sure you reserve a room on the front side. But beware, everyone wants it too and they sell out fast. I probably would not stay at this hotel again unless I was taking an early train in the AM and needed the convenience of being close to the station. I should also add that the hotel was near both bus and tube stops(Vauxhall) and had a very good latin/Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby."
281,1038,"Jun 8 2006	Nice and clean Hotel	My girlfreind and I spend a weekend at Riverbank Park Plaza Hotel, and what a nice time.. The room was clean and especially the bathroom and bed was fine.. The Hotel is located nearby the city and Big Ben is about 10 min walk.."
282,1038,"Jun 7 2006	Great deal	Spotted an offer for the Riverbank Plaza on Travelzoo after searching the internet for an affordable central London hotel. Got a great rate of 79 pounds a night plus taxes with access to the executive floor facilities. Our room was large by any standard, with a flat tv, lovely decor and unbeatable view of houses of Parliament across the river. The location enabled us to walk the riverbank and cross the bridge to the major tourist sites. The bus also came by the hotel. The nearest subway was under repair at the time. The executive floor included a breakfast buffet and a happy hour with beer, wine, soft drinks, coffee, tea and snacks. The staff was helpful and friendly throughout. The bed was very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you don't mind walking a few blocks or taking a bus to get to some tourism sites. We stayed over Easter weekend and were able to attend services at Westminister Abbey on Easter by being so close."
283,1038,"Jun 3 2006	Lovely...	During a stay in April 2006, we truly found the Park Plaza a great base to see London, particularly if you are going to be getting around mostly on foot. While the Vauxhall station is only a 10 minute walk away, Lambeth Bridge is right up the block to take you over to Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster, etc. The neighborhood seemed safe and the riverwalk is nice and quiet. The hotel had a modern feel to it with an Asian twist. Through a special offer, we paid less than we would have at most other London hotels and received an Executive Room and free drinks and breakfast each day. The room did not have much of a view, but it was very quiet and clean. The bathroom was very modern as well, and the gift basket on the dresser was a nice touch when we arrived. The hotel seemed pretty well soundproofed, and the railroad tracks are not directly behind the hotel. However, I suppose very light sleepers that happen to get rooms on that side of the hotel could be disturbed. However, some noise is going to be an issue at just about any hotel you stay in for an urban environment such as London."
284,1038,"May 22 2006 	Clean but thats about it.	This was my second visit in 3 months on both occassions the room was very small and overlooking the railway which is runing from 5am until 12 midnight. On my first visit the fire alarm went off but not on my floor the 10th, we were able to use the lift and the staff seemed indifferent to the obvious safety issues. There were no instructions on the rear of the bedroom door advising the escape route. On my second visit we were given a room normally reserved for people with a disabillity, the bathroom was poorly laid out with no towel rails, a shaving mirror to low to be of any use and the kettle provided didnt fit under the tap and had to be filled via the glass! Bathrooms have no shaving sockets, and the wordrobe had no provision to hang an evening dress.Food ok and it is clean - but thats about all."
285,1038,"May 18 2006	Great swank hip with a great big bed	Spent the night at this wonderful, trendy hotel. It was so great that my wife and I stayed in and ate at the Club Lounge and ordered breakfast in. Great room with all the trimmings, internet , big bed with lots of pillows, attentive staff and a great location. We pinched ourselves with delight. Big marble bathroom, sparkling fixtures. I would rate this hotel as an A+ and we would love to come again and stay a little longer."
286,1038,"May 15 2006	Great hotel!	I stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza when I was in London for business last week. I really liked it! I found it very contemporary, clean, friendly and service minded staff. My room had a great view of London, a big bed and big pillows that gives you a luxurious feeling. I would definately stay there the next time I'm in London. Also try the restaurant, it blends in perfectly with the hotel and the food was excellent, contempary asian. Probably among the best restaurants I have visit."
287,1038,"May 8 2006	Modern design good hotel	Stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza overnight on a weekend as part of a theatre package trip. Good, clean &amp; modern hotel with helpful staff.Had a twin room on the second floor - at the side of the hotel so found it pretty quiet. Room was a good size. Beds were comfy and the room had all the facilities you need - tea &amp; coffee; mini bar; hairdryer; iron &amp; ironing board; safe; LCD TV. Bathroom was an excellent size, had a bath and a separate shower cubicle and was impeccably clean . Had our buffet style breakfast in a room on the 1st floor with a view of the Thames and the Houses of Parliament.Location wise - not in central London but on the Albert Embankment opposite the Tate Britain. If you are happy to get on the tube (nearest tube station is Vauxhall) or catch a taxi youll soon find you are no time away from all the main London sights.Our party of 15 ate in the hotels restaurant in the night - Chino Latino. Restaurant has a modern stylish design. Excellent food (Asian cuisine) and service, although its slightly pricey.Overall, Id stay at this hotel again."

Unforunately my room was on the &quot;train side&quot; it was very noisy there was no river view as promised on the website. for the amount of money I paid I was disappointed.The room was nice, in a contemporary kind of way, and very clean, it was all just a bit impersonal. Got connected to the Wi-Fi but was very slow, and I gave up in the end.Breakfast the next morning was standard hotel fare, nothing exceptional, was just ok......If you are going on a business trip and your company is paying this would be fine, however if you are going on holiday i wouldn't really recommened this hotel."
291,1038,"Apr 25 2006	Great location modern but lacking a 'loca' touch?	Stayed at this hotel with friends last weekend. Great location for us as we prefer to be out of the busier West End. A lovely walk along the Southbank is within easy reach, past the Eye etc. Also handy for Covent Garden &amp; theatres on The Strand, just 6 in a taxi. Journeyed by taxi too from Paddington as only 15 which we thought worth it for 4 with luggage.Rooms were v smart, above average size &amp; lovely, large modern bathrooms. We were on the side of the hotel so could hear the trains but nothing to disturb us! Breakfast was average, v friendly B'fast room mgr but food could have been hotter &amp; toaster quicker &amp;/or not in the middle of the self-service area so that a queue was always forming!Reception staff were friendly &amp; tried to help but they all struggled with English (in London?!) eg Our friends reported that their room's air conditioning was not working &amp; someone brought up 4 bottles of hair conditioner!! Would stay here again as only paid 81 pr rm pr night inc breakfast &amp; complimentary drink so v good value."

Suite was 131 GBP per night inclusive of VAT, breakfast and cocktail hour in executive lounge. Two room suite was clean, comfortable and spacious; breakfast was very good and we enjoyed complementary wine and snacks in the evening in the lounge. Our side of the hotel fronted on the busy train tracks to Waterloo station and the trains were noisy, but stopped running between 11 pm and 5 am weekdays (6 am weekend). Hotel is intended to be a modern, &quot;minimalist&quot; style, so lots of stark walls and black everywhere, but we'd gladly stay there again at the price we paid. Hotel restaurant is a high end asian/latin &quot;fusion&quot; place above our family price range. Local restaurants that do takeaway are just five minutes walk away. Although away from the heart of touristy London, we thought this was a great location overall. Vauxhall Tube stop is 5-7 minute walk, and London buses picked up across street. Short cab ride from Waterloo station."
293,1038,"Apr 19 2006 	Very beautifull hotel but rude- unfriendly - racist staff	I stayed at the riverbank park plaza in the end of march 2006 this year with family. 1)The reception staff was rude, and un attentive.2)No concierge or door man to help with luggage at 5 pm( not so good for a hotel in central london.3)The receptionist couldnt find the reservation in the system. I gave her the confirmation number but still couldnt find the reservation. She wanted me to pay a deposit. even though the room and breakfast was paid for. She then called the reception manager over the phone so i had to wait for the manager for nearly 20 mins to come who was very rude. Now this buliding has 2 hotels in the same place. 1 riverbank park plaza2 Plaza on the thames river. there are 2 reception desks how am i supposed to know where i should go to. Very confusing place.Now my reservation was at the plaza on the river which is the apartments section of the hotel.and i was standing at the riverbank reception desk. There are no sign boards for plaza on the river at the enterance.then came the reception manager who couldnt even find the booking in the system. She said to me that i should check with my agent regarding the same. Or she offered me a room only if i gave her the money... The way i was spoken to was in a cutthroat manner...??? It did nt look very hospitable and was not very 4 star deluxe.....then came another manager apparently the duty manager and said that i should go and try over at the other reception desk to findout to see if my booking was there or no. i felt that i was being ill treated and felt some sought of discrimination over there at the reception desk aginst me an asian guy who has lived in the States for 23 years. I have never been to such a hotel ever in my life..........This not some thing what you expect of a 4 star hotel in london and specially after travelling for 7 hours by air.I shall never come here again and will not recommend this hotel to any one."
294,1038,"Apr 6 2006 	high standards	I have always had high standards, so I tend tojudge harshly on hotels of which I stay in. I found this hotel outstanding, as i found the modern interior refreshing, and i found the restaurant &quot;Chino's&quot; exceptional with its range of alternative cuisine. I am unquestionable coming back to stay here and dine int he restaurant, and will possibly invite clients to dine at the restaurant."
295,1038,"Mar 31 2006 	Best to give this a miss	What a shame....Lovely looking building but cold and impersonal ambience with hardly any staff in attendance when you would expect them. While there are times when it's good to feel that you've got the place to yourself it's not what you'd expect from a busy metropolitan hotel - arriving at ten the evening to find a couple of people in the bar, one person on reception and no doorman or concierge to help with the luggage. Everyone was very friendly and efficient but my stay was further marred by incorrect details on my reservation and a room at the back of the hotel (twenty yards from the main rail link into Waterloo) rather than the Thames view that I had been promised!"
296,1038,"Mar 28 2006 	Best London hotel experience so far	Over the past 6 years, I have had the chance to stay in a number of hotels in London. This has been the most pleasant experience so far.It's not posh, but very nice for a business trip. Positives:* Room size fairly large for standard rooms, nice feeling of space* Plenty of lighting -- in fact very nice orange lighting to mellow down as well* Breakfasts while in the basement (no daylight) were well presented, lots of choice, clean and fresh.* Staff overall very friendly* Very nice amience in the lounge/bar/restaurant* Internt access via WiFi and Ethnernet* Right on the river. Even with a side-room, have a view of water* In-room safe large enough for laptop* Nice carpets!* Nice entertainment sytsem (incl DVD player, flatscreen TV)* Hotel is new, so everything from shower to taps, cupboards -- all clean &amp; new.* Comfortable bed/pillows &amp; clean!Negatives:* Not right off of a tube * Too few extra towels in bathroom* Their website does not do merit do how good the hotel is* Their website does not tell you how to get there via public transport. I emailed them, and they responded the next day (kind of slow) with a copy&amp;paste from their website how to drive there. Not what I asked for !Would definately stay here again."
297,1038,"Mar 20 2006	Will Never Stay at Again	Beautiful rooms, bathroom, lobby and bar. Luxurious but encountered problem after problem. Upon checking in, we found the toilet seat to be covered in urine. Exhausted, we did not want to make a fuss so cleaned it ourselves. Bedlinen was dirty with muddy footprints all over the inside. Also, the next morning, my husband pulled out a used condom that was wrapped around the plughole of the bathroom sink - only discovered due to water not properly draining away. When we reported the problem, the general staff attitude was uncaring and in a state of denial. They seemed to suggest that it was not technically possible for it to happen and implied that we were making it up to get a discount. They offered us complimentary dinner which we accepted, but seemed completely unfussed about the incident. Every staffmember was foreign, and even though I am sure this helps international guests, to us they seemed unfriendly and more concerned with trying to remember the English language than helping their guests. Staff in the restaurant, however, were extremely attentive. The problems we had were most likely one-offs, but the way they dealt with the matter was highly unsatisfactory. I would never stay at this hotel again."
298,1038,"Mar 16 2006	Really a first-rate hotel!	I had the pleasure to stay at Riverbank Park Plaza Hotel for 3 nights, and I warmly recommend this excellent hotel with great service and hospitality.The room was very tasteful furnished and had a marvellous view of the river Thames, the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. The bed was most comfortable and the &quot;marble&quot;-bath-room was equipped with bath as well as separate shower. All staff really made their best to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The Asian- inspired restaurant served a superb dinner.I would love to stay at this hotel again."
299,1038,Mar 7 2006	Lovely hotel with a grate view	We stayed 8 persons for 3 nights. It was a lovely hotel with nice staff. Hopefully we will come back again soon.
300,1038,"Mar 6 2006	Beautiful and VERY comfortable	Best reason for booking this hotel: The hotel is new, modern, and offers a luxury experience for a competitive price. We searched many hotels in London but could not find one as well appointed as the Riverbank for the price. Location:The hotel itself is in a good-ish location, right on the Albert Embankment. We walked along to Waterloo Bridge and crossed in order to get to the Strand. From there, all of central London just opens up if you're willing to be adventurous. Walking in the opposite direction along the Albert Embankment took us to Vauxhall Bridge, which again we crossed to find the British Museum and a nice French cafe. Eating &amp; Transport:There is not much around in the immediate vicinity by way of good eating, but this is no problem if you're willing to walk a little. The room:Our spotless room was beautifully appointed, with tasteful decor, modern furnishings and fine linen. The bed was sumptuous and the bath was one of the most relaxing ever. There was a delightful entertainment system which allowed us to play our own CDs. Just the ticket for a romantic evening. The room could have been bigger, but we didn't mind this trade off for the very cosy, clean and neat experience we received."
301,1038,"Mar 1 2006	Fantastic Stay!	Stayed here with my family for one night (six of us spread over 3 rooms). There were a lot of extra requests - cot in one room, extra bed in another - and we were delighted that everything had been perfectly organised on arrival. Rooms were lovely - especially the bathrooms - and the beds were extremely comfortable. I found the entertainment system a little tricky to work out (in fact I couldn't even figure out how to switch it on, although my partner managed so I'm sure it can't have been that difficult!). Although our rooms were facing the railway track we had no issues with noise at all. Breakfast was incredibly busy but the staff coped admirably and were even happy to have porridge specially prepared for the baby in the party. We had the same receptionist on check-in and check-out and she was friendly and helpful.Overall, a great stay at a fabulous hotel!"
302,1038,"Jan 21 2006	Not the W but nice enough	I got this hotel on priceline for a relatively good rate ($120 USD) for London. At the time, most of the 4* hotels on expedia/orbitz/venere were either booked or well over $200. While I agree with other posters about the modern feel, I'd say if you're used to staying at the W, this rather pales in comparison but is a fair approximation of that streamlined aesthetic. There's a younger feel to the hotel althoug many of the guests apeared to be late 20's/early 30's professionals on work-related excursions, a pretty mainstream crowd. Staff was gracious and responsive -- gave me another room after I told them the first one had a strange odor. Second room had only a partial view of the Thames, since I wasn't on the frontward facing side. Be prepared to walk quite a bit to the closest tube station and/or bus stop. The bus stop in front of the hotel doesn't take you Northward towards most of the sights -- you have to walk across the bridge and turn right to reach the proper bus that heads North towards the British Museum, theaters, shopping areas. Also, the closest tube wasn't one of the main lines so you usually had to transfer -- not difficult but something to be aware of. I enjoyed my stay but I was very glad that I had invested in some good boots -- cabs were expensive. Took the Eurostar after I checked out ( Waterloo station is very near-by) and it still cost me 6 GBP to go around 5 blocks. Overall, much better than your average hotel. Concierge was helpful about which bus to catch, etc."
303,1038,"Jan 21 2006	Sophisticated hotel without the sophisticated price tag	We stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza the first weekend in January and got a really good deal. Was initially quite worried as it wasnt in the best area but was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was lovely - modern, well furnished and the service was excellent. We ate breakfast in the hotel the first morning. There was a wide variety to choose from and was very good value for money. Would definately recommend this hotel. Very good value for money."
304,1038,"Jan 18 2006	Fantastic!	Instead of driving 80 miles home after seeing a show, we decided to book a room at the Riverbank Park Plaza Hotel. Having stayed at this hotel in December we knew exactly what we would get. Superb service and rooms that are among the best we have ever stayed in. All in all I cannot recommend this hotel enough. We will definitely be back...."
305,1038,"Jan 9 2006	Very Nice	My partner and I spent the night on New Years Eve 2005. Managed to find a parking space on the very narrow backroads, but parking is 17 a night with the hotel. Staff were very friendly, not aloof. On arrival they swipe a credit/debit card for 50, a kind of guarentee that you have the funds to pay for any extras such as minibar/room service. Beware! The minibar automatically charges you for anything you take out, even if you put it back in. Room service isn't as expensive as I thought. The view is wonderful- ours was of the Thames and Houses of Parliament/Big Ben. The London Eye wasn't in view as the hotel is on the same side of the road 1km up. The room lighting very nice. Tv, dvd, kettle, table, warbdrobe, ironing board, iron all included, with the bathroom imaculate as well as the queen size bed (this is a standard room.) ice machines at the end of each corridor with a large room on the 5th floor being the gym (free to use). A mixture of ages were there. Couldn't hear anything outside of our room which was great as there was a private function party downstairs in the bar area. Matched all my expectations of a 4* deluxe hotel and would go back again, as very clean, modern, spacious and relaxing. Close to London attractions- the staff will advise. The bill is settled at the end of the stay, we paid by cash and the 50 swiping at the beginning remained pending on my account for a couple of days but was not taken."
306,1038,"Dec 7 2005	very nice hotel But............	My husband and I have just returned from staying 2 nights in the Riverbank Park Plaza, we were in London on a shopping trip.Upon Check-in we find desk clerk quite unpleasant, again we had to have 50 taken from our credit card but it was refunded back to us on our departure.We found Vauxall was the closest underground but it was a good 10 min walk to the hotel.Rooms were very nice and very clean and very modern, but apart from housekeeping staff ......staff were very aloof and I feel some of them thought they owned the Riverbank Park Plaza rather than justed worked there.Would I return no I don't think so I think I would rather return to the Radisson Edwardian Hotel rooms not as nice or as modern but the staff there SMILE!!!!!!!!"
307,1038,"Dec 6 2005	Good - but some reservations	Stayed one night before catching early morning Eurostar, this must be about the best hotel closest to Waterloo. Overall really liked the hotel as it is quite new and therefore has a good ultramodern feel to it, the standard bedroom was a very reasonable size and liked the fact that the en-suite had seperate bath &amp; shower. However......upon check in the desk clerk took my credit card and with no explanation craftily charged 50 to it without informing me that he had done so, either beforehand or afterwards. I was not given a copy of the credit card slip either, so they were clearly trying to hide the fact. They claim that it is done merely to check that you have credit available. Also beware of picking up items in &quot;computerised&quot; mini bar. Also, with the exception of the morning breakfast room staff found all of the staff to be rather aloof.Despite problems will go back as nice hotel, forewarned is forearmed."
308,1038,"Dec 5 2005	Very trendy very smart 	We chose to stay in this hotel for a weekend break after having read positive reviews on TripAdvisor, and were not disappointed. The location is convenient for the South Bank and Westminster, with the closest tube being about ten minutes walk. It is very tastefully decorated in a modern style in both the public areas and the rooms, with nice lighting. We asked for a riverview, and as a result ended up with fantastic views - very romantic! The room size was good (for London!) as were the amenities. Food and service in the restaurant were both top-notch. The two minor irritations were being unable to get the DVD player to work and the rather hurried bar staff. In summary, this is an excellent hotel and I hope it motivates other London hotels to improve their act. Return? Try stopping us!"
309,1038,Dec 2 2005	Friendly Family Business Hotel	We were celebraiting our mothers 70 years old brithday. We had four rooms in three nights.Immediately when we arrived we felt like coming home.The staff was very nice and helpful.During the days the hotel recommend us what to doand see for a family between 11-70 years old.They also helped us with a table on a famous restaurant wich has been fully booked for a couple of mounth. It was like a dream!Every evening ended up in the bar in front of the fire place with a nice mix of cocktails and a very good Japanese draft beer.The athmosfere was very relaxing! We are coming back!!
310,1038,Nov 29 2005	amazing view lovely atmosphere	First time I stayed at this hotel but absolute not the last. The best service and outstanding rooms. Loved the modern architecture
311,1038,"Nov 24 2005	New 4* currently flawed but with potential	Ive just returned from my second overnight stay within a month at this hotel so now its time to log my comments. Firstly, this is a brand new hotel, opened about 6 months ago, so you would expect some teething problems. However I  and my colleague  have found more problems than we expected. My colleague arrived late  about 8 pm  but this should not present a problem as our bookings are made through our Company and its wholly-owned Travel Agency and are guaranteed for late arrival. However the hotel reception stated that they had no record of his booking! As he did not have a printed copy of the email confirmation he had to arrange to connect his laptop onto our Company email server, relocate that email and then print it out before they would believe him! Apparently this - together with the inevitable queues at reception - added another hour before he finally got to his room! On my first stay  3 weeks ago  I had a free room upgrade to an executive lounge on the 11th floor, the room is initially impressive but there were certain items missing which should have been present, i.e. hairdryer, iron, ironing board, room service menu. I eventually had take the lift down to reception to sort out these problems as the internal phone remained unanswered. My second stay took place this week and  sad to say  even in the standard room I was allocated this time there were more items missing! This time it was the hairdryer again but there was also no list of internal phone contact numbers, these are not stated anywhere in the printed material available but should show as an overlay on the phone but it wasnt there  the phone was bare! So with no list of numbers it meant another trek down to reception to get all this resolved. They responded quickly  after I queued of course  and within 15 minutes 2 people arrived, one with a replacement hair dryer and another with the missing card to slot on my phone to show all the internal contact numbers. Other problems include: on booking-in (after queuing of course) I handed over printed details of my booking  reasons, see above! - and they asked for my address and credit card details again, apparently no record had been retained from my previous visit. They also asked to keep my print-out of the confirmatory email booking, Ive never before received such a request from any of the many hotels in which Ive stayed, this also meant that I was now personally without printed confirmation of my booking agreement and conditions  so possible problems at check-out! Also you need to note that this hotel is built in a very noisy location  with a 4-lane road on one side and an 8-track railway (Waterloo main line) on the other. So the double glazed windows are barely adequate to keep the racket out, it should have been built with triple glazing or additional secondary glazing panels. I noticed that there were also acoustic deflectors on the front of the building (facing the road) but my room was at the rear (just metres from the railway) and none existed there. Trains pass every few minutes and you are so close you can feel some of them, not just hear them! However my ear plugs ensured that I got a passable nights sleep. In the bathroom, there is no shaver point and the lack of a barrier between the shower cubicle and the rest of the bathroom means that water flows all over the bathroom floor even with the shower curtain fully drawn  its really a triumph of design over practicality! Also one of the bathroom lights stayed on all night (apparently by design) so this light showed through into the bedroom as there was a 1-inch gap under the connecting door. I blocked the gap with a towel! The digital TV signal on the rather awkward-to-use TV/Internet/Email/CD/DVD/MP3 console was prone to fading on certain channels (especially Five), this had the effect of freezing the picture or making the sound out-of-sync with the picture. This suggests a weak signal so I presume the TVs in all rooms are similarly affected. The bed pillows are too soft, I ended up using the cushions! My room service meal in the evening was perfectly OK if a little expensive as there is a mandatory 12.5% service charge added. My room service breakfast was again OK but lacking in some of the food items Ive received elsewhere, e.g. jams/marmalade. However this breakfast works out ridiculously expensive as they add a 5.00 tray charge and then another 12.5% service charge on top of this. To cap it all they then tried to charge for the breakfast twice  breakfast was included in my room booking  but on check-out I was told I was over my agreed limit which can be charged back directly back to the Agency, and they would want me to pay the extra on my own credit card! This was of course because the continental breakfast (at 13.00) had been included twice! They were also unable to print off a copy of my bill at check-out, yet this is something our Agency asks us to do and sign for before leaving the hotel. All in all this hotel has the potential to become the 4* attraction it claims to be but there is a whole lot more attention which must be paid to the details before I could recommend it for anything other than a 1-night stay. At the moment its at best 3* service masquerading as 4*. And the outside noise intrusion is really inexcusable in a newly-built hotel in that location and would be difficult to rectify."
312,1038,"Nov 22 2005	Superhotel with a view	We stayed two nights at the Riverbank Plaza in London. Exellent rooms, exellent service, exellent view over the Thames and exellent food at ther rest. Chino Latino.We will be back."
313,1038,"Nov 21 2005	Perfect and I hope it stays this way!	We booked this hotel on Priceline from Nov. 14 - Nov. 20 - and it exceeded all expectations. The check in was short and painless, the hotel staff very friendly, the concierge very knowledgeable and helpful, and the rooms were clean, well lighted, bright and the bathroom was excellent - large and a good shower with power!It is located over the Lambreth Bridge so you can catch the #3 bus that takes you up to the Westminster Tube Station, or continues on to Picadilly and Oxford Circus. It is a night bus too so that makes it convenient if you are staying out late.We didn't eat in the restaurant or have the breakfast so I cannot comment on those venues. We did have coffee making facilities in the room which also worked out great!The most amazing thing about this hotel is it has a US current plug in every room - that's right, your blow dryer, shaver, curling iron, straightener, all work in this hotel!!!We certainly will go back to the hotel, although I expect that the rates will rise significantly. Don't be put off by the location over the bridge, the hotel certainly makes up for that!!!"
314,1038,"Nov 16 2005	Stunning - just what London needs.	Stayed in a standard room the night before my wedding and a suite on the wedding night. We loved this hotel. In contrast to other reviewers, I felt the standard room was actually quite big for a hotel in England. I've stayed in 4-5* hotels across the country and the Riverbank has amongst the biggest I've stayed in. Rooms are clean, well equipped and have comfortable beds. Hotel staff were enthusiastic, efficient and very polite.The beautifully designed bar was a real focal point although it needed a few more customers to give it more of a buzz. I was upgraded to an apartment suite for the Saturday night which had an amazing view. We had a delicious breakfast served in our living room with friends overlooking the Houses of Parliament.All in all, I can't fault this hotel. The minimalist design skilfully avoided being tacky or soulless. Despite living only three miles away, I can't wait to stay there again!"
315,1038,Nov 15 2005	Best location and wiew	One of the best hotel I have stayed in!. Excellent service and a very nice atmosphere.
316,1038,"Nov 12 2005 	Very very good!	A modern, stylish hotel, extremely friendly staff, good value for your money; more than one can usually expect in London.I booked a executive room, but was upgraded to suite, which was situated in the 5 star wing (as opposed the &quot;normal&quot; 4 star wing). The suite was decorated in a strict contemporary style (so if you prefer &quot;English style&quot;, this is not for you). The suite consists of a &quot;living&quot; room (a working space, sofa, armchair, a dining table for two) kitchenette (very well equipped), a bathroom in sand stone with separate bath tub and spacious shower cabin. There was two flat tv-sets and dvd-players, and a separate air conditioning for both rooms (but what's the point of having a duvet in the bed and then need to use air conditioning?). I am sure the suite serves well for a longer stay. One problem I had though: the windows are soundproofed, but as I sleep light, the railway behind the building kept waking me. This possible problem obviously does not exist in the rooms facing the atrium.As I most probably will use a normal room, I asked to see one. It also was elengant and even quite spacious. (So yes, it fulfils my needs.)There is also a executive lounge, which perhaps does not give very much added value: a lot of tables and chairs in quite limited space, something to drink, but not too much to eat. The hotel bar was clearly more cozy.The location is perhaps not the best in London, but it still quite close to Westminster, and within a walking distance to Waterloo station. A taxi to Paddington station took 15-20 minutes.As a conclusion: highly recommendable!"
317,1038,"Nov 1 2005	Fantastic stay!	We have just returned after a weekend in London and stayed at the Riverbank as part of a prize. The hotel is fantastic, the service was great from start to finish and the concierge working over the weekend couldn't have been more helpful and recommended two restaurants that were not only reasonable priced but also served delicious food. Our room was a superior and was very spacious with a partial view of the Thames. The bed was lovely and soft and the bathroom again was large with a separate glass shower cubicle. Breafast in the morning was very comprehensive with a large choice including traditional cooked as well as a huge variety of cereals, seeds and nuts, cold cuts, croissant etc. For us, the location was fine, it only took 15 mins to walk across the bridge to westminster, or alternatively, Vauxhall tube station was only 10 mins walk. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and if we stay in London again, will definitely stay here!"
318,1038,"Oct 25 2005	Return?? Yes!!	Stayed four nights in the Riverbank Plaza hotel, enjoyed it all the time.Very good service from the staff. delicius food. A wonderful view over the River.Beautiful rooms with dvd, internet, tv channels.Will recommend it."
319,1038,"Oct 24 2005 	Superrelaxing	Best long weekendstay so far. Friendly staff, modern style and very good food and service. And the view from the hotel is worth a lot!!!!"
320,1038,"Oct 24 2005	Clean and friendly luxury	10 of us stayed at this hotel for 1 night. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we were all on the same floor. The rooms are spotless, modern and have every amenity but may be just a little small. The bathrooms are spotless, large and luxurious. The beds are sooooo comfortable. We did not pay extra for the view but as we only slept in the room it didn't really matter. The breakfast selection (included) was excellent. We got the tube to Vauxhall and walked past MI6 to hotel.(10 mins). Next day we walked to Westminster, Eye etc. (10 mins in opposite direction). 4 of our party were upgraded as thier rooms were not ready when they arrived (there was no hesitation from the staff )and they had the use of the executive lounge which they thoroughly enjoyed. For a short stay I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. The only negative points I would note are that the very modern minamalist decor can appear cold and unfriendly and that the tube could be a bit closer! Overall, this was excellent value for money."
321,1038,Oct 18 2005	It was great	Spend three nights in London and it was a very good hotel. Personal and service was perfect. They always give a hand and nothing was diffucult. Best complements!
322,1038,"Oct 17 2005	....""Will definately visit this hotel again""	Recently stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza hotel in London - we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was beautifully laid out with stunning views of the river Thames, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Breakfast was very enjoyable and hot!!! Chino Latino restaurant was fantastic. Can't wait to return..."
323,1038,Oct 13 2005	Best Hotel in London	Stayed this weekend and it was a lovely Hotel.Brand new and such a good location with view over the river well worth the extra money we paid.Very good breakfast and concierge and all staff were all so friendly.I was told that during the week they have started a bus service also which would will be even better.Will be back for christmas shopping.
324,1038,"Oct 12 2005	Love the Riverbank	We loved the Riverbank and plan to go back again very soon. The hotel is extremely beautiful and contemporary. Our room had a comfy bed, lots of pillows, a flat screen TV and a gorgeous bathroom with walk in glass shower. Our airconditioning worked perfectly and the room was clean and quiet. We didn't hear a sound from outside or from other rooms. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. We often walked the Riverbank walkway down to the Eye and then to the Globe theatre. There are interesting restaurants along the walk (and a Starbucks). What more could you want? Sure, it's a little out of the way but a bus to Kensington stops right in front of the hotel. Vauxall tube is 2 blocks away and a block the other direction is the #3 bus to Trafalger, Piccadilly and Oxford. We found it easy to take the bus to and from the theatre district. We were always happy to come back to our clean and lovely hotel. If you don't mind a five minute walk and a ten minute bus ride, stay at the Riverbank. Go soon as I suspect the rates will dramatically increase once word gets out about this lovely hotel."
325,1038,"Oct 10 2005 	Sublime!	I enjoyed a fantastic six night stay at the Riverbank Park Plaza during my last visit to London. The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms, and the design och ambiance in the public areas are second to none. Add the charming smiles from the receptionists, and the courteous and very speedy respons from concierge regardless was it an impossible booking at the Ivy or theathre tickets, and your visit to London has been sublimely enhanced. I'm thrilled and very gratefull."
326,1038,"Oct 7 2005	Very new: mixed feelings	We had a fun stay at the Riverbank Park Plaza, but I'm not sure I'd return.We were upgraded to their brand new Residence Club, which shares the lobby with the hotel. The suite had a TERRIFIC river view. It was sleek and modern and immaculate. The staff sent up a fruit basket. The TVs offered all the channels. The hotel offers a menu of pillows. The bed was very comfortable. There were 2 robes, not the usual single robe. The sleekness was extreme: there were no hooks or towel bars in the very compact bathroom.On the downside: the hotel is so new that the cabbies don't know it , and London cabbies know everything...so if you stay here, do know the address!The tube stations are a bit of a walk, as are most central London attractions. The Tate (old) is directly across the Thames, and the Eye is within walking distance, but otherwise, the location is not convenient. There are no nearby restaurants or shops.The &quot;Executive Lounge&quot; for breakfast and snacks (included with our rate) was on the hotel side (down one elevator and up another) and our key card did not work for access--nor did many other guests, as we all had to knock to get in for breakfast, or find help for off hours snacks (potato chips and olives). Breakfast was very nice, once we got into the room! We got a lot for the money, a terrific view and the suite was fun, but the location is a big minus unless you need to be in Lambeth."
327,1038,"Sep 26 2005	Look no further	Contemporary, modern, clean hotel. Room was quiet and included a UK, Euro and US plug socket. There was a fully digital entertainment system which included a flat screen LCD and DVD player. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. Restaurant served good food at a decent price. 5 minute walk to Vauxhall tube station and bus stops all around, if you are smart with taste you'll stay here."
328,1038,"Sep 25 2005 	A varied experience	This hotel was well priced compared to other, comparable London hotels, very important for us as our Australian dollar is so weak against the GBP. The lobby is very impressive and the staff were generally helpful, although somewhat brusque at times. The decor is elegant modern, in a red and black and marble kind of way. Unfortunately, the aircondioning was not working during our 3 day stay in late August, which also coincided with London having an extended period of heat, and on our floor and in our room it was fairly suffocating. There was no response to our queries about when it would be repaired, which was frankly disappointing. We ate a delicious, creative, and interesting meal in the Chino restaurant; it was very expensive, but we did so willingly. A pity that there seemed to be very few other diners there. The location is pretty good, an easy walk along the embankment to many of the favourite London tourist locations, and there is a bus stop outside the hotel. The breakfast room was very noisy, a combination of a persistent, loud machine noise (a suffering airconditioning system?) and very loud music, which I noticed other guests asking to be turned down lower, it was, marginally. Our room had a somewhat disappointing view of the Waterloo line (multiple tracks) and an adjacent old office building. But, the room was comfortable, had a beautful bathroom, well supplied tea and coffee, and was cleaned properly each day. Better than many old fashioned London hotels, but still having teething problems. If those were fixed, we may stay there again given the reasonable (for London) price."
329,1038,"Sep 1 2005	First Class - Reasonable Rates	Got it from Expedia for 190 for 2 nights.Between Parliment and Tate Britain. 5 mins to Vauxhall and 10 mins to Westminister underground.Clean, smart and fantastic lifts! Rooms were very modern with nice 'extras' (DVD player, nice lighting etc..). Staff very polite.Nice bathrooms with seperate shower and bath.Very highly recommended for about 10 a night more than a travel inn! I would stay there again."
330,1038,"Aug 30 2005	Best Hotel of Europe Trip!!!	The Riverbank Park Plaza was definitely the best hotel of our European trip. Since there weren't may reviews of the hotel, being that it is new, I was a bit skeptical. However, upon arriving, I was thoroughly impressed. The bar area and lobby were trendy and elegant. The staff was very friendly. We were also upgraded to an Executive room since we had requested a non-smoking room. The Executive rooms were a decent size, but with very modern decor. Nice linen, flat screen TV, beautiful bathroom. Best of all, we got a good rate ($150 per night).. especially considering how weak the dollar is compared to pounds. The only downside of the hotel is it's location. It is in walking distance of the London Eye, Big Ben and Parliament. However, to get to other parts of London, the metro was about a ten minute walk away. We also had dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Chino Latino. It was the best dinner we had in London.. although a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.Because the quality of a hotel is more important to me than location, I would most definitely stay here again. You should too!!"

1,1040,"ubiquitous large hotel but excellent value for money	Rooms were a decent size, very clean and very quiet. Excellent location and good value for money."
2,1040,"Nov 24 2009 	rooms not up to standard but not really the staff's fault	Having chosen the park Plaza for its location and we had stayed at the park Plaza Westminster before and having a fab stay. In a excutive suite. We were looking forward to re- living the experiance.Although centrally located for great shopping walking and restaurants, the park Plaza seemed dingy to say the least. The rooms were tired, marks and stains to furniture and carpets, curtains thin and ill fitting, rooms felt cold and un loved. The sliding door to the open terrace could not be locked and i found the place a little depressing. The staff on reception were friendly enough and we were invited to enjoy an excutive lounge were there were free drinks, canapes &amp; papers - yet another dull room, with hard chairs, bright lights very poor drinks selection and canapes? some sort of chicken mousse sausage thing sliced and served on a cracker (tasted of nothing) and a bowl of chinese rice crackers! if you are giving away anything give good or not at all.The location is great for station and many eating houses! but the Westiminter park plaza is leagues ahead far nicer, cosy, contempory styling and a much warmer feeling."
3,1040,"Nov 24 2009 	Bed needed to be upgrade	Very good well designed hotel ,The location and breakfast is good.However, the downsides are :1) No air condition at winter tiimes, only warm air will blow out from the machine.So stuffy room foe some days and need to open the window.2) The beds become too soft or due to overused and you can't feel the support of the mattress at all.So very uncomforably bed and pillows.So I think they should put more money in maintaining or upgrading the bed mattress and blankets.I prefer a hotel with provision of all the basic stuffs such as good sleep bed and pillows rather than having a good looking hotel. 3) also early check in is usually not entertained although I've seen empty rooms upstairs.4) The internet rate is expensive : 15 pounds per day or 60 pounds a week .Most likely I would not come back again, I think I can find better one with similar price nearby"
4,1040,"Nov 19 2009 	ParK Plaza Victoria	The good points were : complimentary morning paper, excellent buffet breakfast, freedrink from 6 to 8 PM. The hotel is located in a good location (near Victoria Station) withgood restaurants near by. The only neagative was our room had a faulty toilet that would not flush. We had to complain three times before we were moved to another room.Inspite of this, I would still recommend the hotel."
5,1040,"Nov 15 2009 	Excellent well located hotel	We stayed at this hotel for one Saturday evening in November. We arrived at the hotel at 0945 not expecting to check in but just drop our bags, we were greeted by an excellent receptionist who welcomed us to the hotel and offered to check us in, there was four in the party and we had requested rooms close to each other. The receptionist offered to up grade us to a two bedroomed family apartment at no extra cost so we could all stay together, the apartment was excellent on the 8th floor with a large lounge area with wide screen TV, table and chairs for 4 people, fully equipped kitchen facilities - hob, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, kettle.This was excellent as you could bring things back to your room to cook, especially handy if your staying for longer than one night. The apartment had a huge outside balcony from which you could view many of the city's sights as well as watching the many planes go past every couple of minutes. The bathroom was well equipped with hair dryer, toiletries, large walk in shower as well as a huge bath with shower head. The bedrooms were ok in size but also had large screen tv's. The hotel is in an excellent location right behind Victoria station, easy to get to from most areas of London. We used the tube and buses to travel around and did not have any worries about coming back to the hotel late on the evening. We did not have anything to eat or drink in the hotel so cannot comment on prices or quality but the services we did use were all excellent, it seems the hotel is fairly new and the decor was very modern. The staff we came into contact with were all very friendly and helpful. When we checked out we used the free luggage storage service which seemed very secure as this was only accessed by the conceirge"
6,1040,"Nov 13 2009 	OK hotel but overpriced	I have stayed at this hotel many times since we have a corporate rate and it is close to the office. The location is very close to Victoria station. The staff is usually helpful and friendly and the rooms are usually clean, although a bit small (even for London). However, I have found there is always something wrong with the room. My last stay it was the heating in the room. Other times there has been dripping water in the bathroom, keycards that get de-magnetized on your way from the reception to the room, noisy air-conditioning, etc.The breakfast buffet is very good."
7,1040,Nov 13 2009 	disappointed..wont stay any more.	have stayed in park plaza london earlier also.last 2 times had some issues..one or the other.this time was terrible.No internet connection in the room.very poor support.promises to set right never kept.had to meet the GM.nice person&gt;&gt;.helped with wireless internet connection.from the day till i came until i left Mini Bar never worked.....many reminders ..many promises..no action.to check in..to checkout..and to address a concern..long waiting at the Reception Desk.the main prtoblem with the hotel seems to be no action being taklen or...very delayed action.all staff coulkd be more friendly(except very few).Dop Not Disturb Sign is not respected.House keeping staff who do not speak english just walk into the room even without knocking at the door.remember to always request for the Body Soap...if not you dont get it in the Toilet...it seems the Hotel does not want any one to have a shower with Soap!!!:)in the room during winter the Air conditioning only heats up.too warm if AC switched on.have to keep windows open...again...makes it noisy in the night.Heard that whoever made this Hotel this is how it was made!!!!unbelievable!!!time to call someone to set it right.good things are that the hotel is close to Victoria station.good location.
8,1040,"Nov 11 2009 	Nice hotel great location	I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Booked it because of the conference, I was not disappointed. The hotel is modern and clean and has an efficient professional staff, all very friendly and welcoming. Concierges are very helpful, especially Danny. The room was very spacious the bed was comfortable, the room had US adapter. The breakfast at the hotel was very good.Hotel has a great location for vacation or business, very central for a lot of the touristy sights. 2 minutes walk to Victoria train station and Tube, shopping close by, lots of great restaurants and bars .Walking distance to Parliament and Buckingham Palace."
9,1040,"Nov 3 2009 	A real find	We use this hotel at least twice a year and love it. Decided to post as I am amazed at the negative reports. Firstly, always book an exec. room the difference in price is well worth it. To find an hotel in the centre of London at such a good rate is in itself a huge plus. Love the early evening freebie as we then meet other guests and a party atmosphere soon develops before we all go our own ways. The staff have always been polite and accommodating. Only gripe - rooms need more light."
10,1040,"Oct 29 2009 	Excellent location for famlies	We stayed for 3 nights with a package that included breakfast and free drinks and nibbles from 6-8 PM. First time at the Victoria, we usually stay at the County Hall site Excellent location for the tube or just walking into the City centre. No distance from Buckingham Palace. Theres plenty of good restaurants around the hotel, we used Giraffe, Wagamama and a great little Mexican restaurantLocation is clean and safe. The only problem was that our room was next to the lift shaft, we got used to the constant droning after the first 8 hours!Breakfast was very good, no waiting and pleasant staff. Very similar to the County Hall Park Plaza in decor and facilities, will be interesting to see what happens when the new Westminster Park Plaza hotel opens.Would stay again, excellent for families. There are cheaper hotels in London but at the end of the day you get what you pay for"
11,1040,"Oct 22 2009 	Great Location	We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights (Oct 16/17) whilst visiting London for a family wedding.Personally I found the hotel's location perfect, close to Victoria Station/Tube, and therefore the rest of London. The hotel itself is perfectly fine, the rooms being large &amp; clean &amp; the reception/bar area quite nice. We did not eat at the hotel but did take breakfast across the road both mornings in the 'Giraffe' restaurant which was very tasty. There are also a lot of restaurants close by. When I return to visit London in the future I would definitely consider staying here again because of the location and the room rate we got through prepaying for our rooms thru the hotel's website."
12,1040,"Oct 20 2009 	Nothing but lip.	Stayed at the Park Plaza over the W/E of 18th Oct. Visited London with 2 friends Sweden, I'm a Brit. The hotel location ,and condition was perfectly OK ,the rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortably.However we found the staff were, rude in most cases,and very abrupt.Simple requests like putting the drinks on the room were a major task, bare-faced lies regarding a change of TV channel.Having already eaten the breakfast, I asked if I could re-enter to pick up a fruit juice, before I'd finished I got a hand held up to my face, and told to speak to someone else, I tried again, and got the same response with more volume.That guy still does not know what I was going to ask for.....for all he knew I could have needed medical help.It's a shame ecause the Hotel itself in in good shape, however the last like I expect from hotel staff, is nothing but lip !Additionally, it seemed not confined to the odd individual, but 3 or 4 small irriting issues,from 3 or 4 different staff members seems more like a problem in training / hiring, although the staff behind the front desk were much more what one should expect."
13,1040,"Oct 3 2009 	Good Quality Chain Hotel	I stayed at the Park Plaza Victoria for a week. This is a good hotel. It's part of a large chain, so it's a bit impersonal, but it's fairly well kept up and well run. I arrived at 8:30 am from a transatlantic flight so I expected to have to drop off my luggage and come back later to check in, but there was a room available and the manager at the front desk let me have it right then; a very pleasant surprise. The room itself was fine, no complaints. I did not use any hotel facilities. I had breakfast at the hotel once; a fairly standard and quite acceptable buffet-style operation. There are pleanty of coffee/sandwich shops nearby. The hotel's location is excellent if one wants to be close to the Victoria Station rail/tube/bus hub."
14,1040,"Sep 22 2009 	Great location and modern hotel	Modern, efficient professional staff, clean and a perfect location for leisure or business. Walk to Victoria train station and Tube, shopping close by including a M&amp;S food store (save $). Good lounge. Walk to Parliament and Buckingham Palace. I have stayed here before and sought it out again on this trip because I knew it was reliable. I dislike drafty old hotels with hot water that might not be so hot. and elevators that are tiny and scary. Like all UK mattresses, this one was a bit soft but he rooms are large (like US hotels for those of you who are obsessed with room size)."
15,1040,"Sep 11 2009 	A bit pricey for what you get	My husband, 6 year old daughter, and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza 2 nights, one the night before our coach tour &amp; one the night after, a week apart. The first night check-in was very late due to our plane landing at Heathrow just after 8 pm, then waiting for our luggage, and the 1 hour subway ride to Victoria Station. The hotel is super convenient to Victoria Station &amp; lots of theatres and sightseeing. We had requested a room with a queen or king bed plus a roll-away or sofa bed for our daughter. We did indeed get a large king bed with a roll-away tucked next to the window. Truly, the bed was large enough that all three of us could have easily fit, but our daughter was thrilled to have her own little bed. The first night we were so tired and hungry we decided to just order room service. At that late time, the menu is limited. Mostly just sandwiches. The sandwiches were just brown wheat bread with a slice of cheese &amp; loaded with ham, but certainly not 30 pounds worth for two sandwiches &amp; a few &quot;crisps.&quot; The next morning we had to meet our tour group early, so we woke early and got every one ready in the tiny, but clean bathroom. The staff at reception the night before incorrectly told us breakfast started at 6:30. This time is correct Monday thru Saturday, but Sundays it starts at 7, leaving us with only an hour to eat and walk to the tour center. Breakfast was included in the room rate and was a serve-yourself buffet style with runny, watery scrambled eggs (yuck), sausages, hash browns, and a variety of cereals &amp; pastries. A waiter took our hot drink orders (coffee and hot cocoa). The staff was quick to take away dirty dishes and offer refills on the coffee.The second night was at the conclusion of our coach tour. Having been in the UK for a solid week, we realized that runny, watery scrambled eggs were the norm. Everywhere we went (Lancaster, Edinburgh, Glasgow, etc) served the same breakfast with very little variation regardless of the brand or size of the hotel. This time we decided to go out for dinner, only to find that many places close by couldn't serve us do to the pub vs. restaurant rules that state that children cannot be served after a certain time. It was 7 pm and we ended up going to Sainbury's and picking up sandwiches to take back to the room. This night the room was exactly one floor above where we had been the first night. But this room was dirty and dingy. The carpeting just outside the bathroom door had obvious mildew from too many leaky showers. The sink was not dirty, but seemed old and worn despite being the same style as the sink in the first room.Upon check out both nights, we were asked what currency we wanted our credit card billed in, pounds or euro or US dollars. Being American we requested dollars, but were charged in euros.The absolute BEST thing about this hotel is it's location. It only took us 4-5 minutes (with three suitcases &amp; a tired 6 year old) to walk to and from Victoria Station. We had some time before we needed to head to the airport for our flight home, so we walked to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben &amp; the London Eye, and Westminster Abbey and back along Victoria Street to the hotel. All in just over 90 minutes. I can say that I want to return to London for a more detailed sightseeing tour, but I wil NOT be staying at this over-priced, not quiet a 4 star hotel.I would only recommend this hotel if location is your primary concern."
16,1040,"Sep 10 2009 	Great location nice room	Nice room, comfortable beds, quiet. I had to book a room with 2 beds, and bith were comfortable. Its in a great location because it is very close to Victoria Tube and Train station, yet walkable to Big Ben etc. This location was great for travel to the underground station, the trains to southern cities I visited, and the bus/tour bus station was a short walk. Also, Victoria station has food, groceries, etc. I liked this location much better than Bayswater where I stayed last time. The hotel room was very modern, quiet on the 5th and 6th floors, air conditioned etc.Complaints? Ok, for the $$ I spent, they could at least have a free computer you could use like many other hotels do. Also, the tubs are very high sided, so stepping in and out is tricky, especially for older people when the pretty tile floors get slick. Take care is all.I would definetely stay there again."
17,1040,"Sep 3 2009 	Lower end of 4 star but great location	This hotel is at the lower end of 4 star however the location is fantastic. The hotel is less than 5 minutes from the Victoria overland and tube train stations, making it very easy to travel around London and beyond. There are also two small supermarkets nearby together with a larger store (Sainsbury). Hotel staff are helpful and friendly, though the rooms are somewhat dated. Although located in quite a busy area, the rooms are well insulated from the outside noise. There is a small fitness centre on the 3rd underground floor but no pool."
18,1040,"Aug 25 2009 	Try to find something better for this much money!	I will start from the end: I noticed the hotel charged without asking me my credit card in euro, instead than in GBP, this I am sure they did on purpose because the exchange rate applied is higher and is increasing their income. I stayed for 4 nights, the only reason to be there is the location. I stayed in the Park Plaza in Bangkok and I loved, I choose this one thinking was the same and I was so much disappointed. The rooms are pretty old, although not so small as other hotels in London, bedsheets are old even though are clean, there is old tv with little channels and often not working, no DVD set, no lights except the main switch, so the room is quite dark. The wardrobe has a fancy handle so stupid you cannot even grab as little it is! Bathroom ok, the staff is providing little things for personal care (only soap, shower gel and shampoo). NO SLIPPERS! Unbelievable! I even complained with the reception, they don't care very much, they learned like an answering machine how to check in and check out a customer and that's it! Gym is very small but at least is complimentary, the only thing, because internet is for paying in the room and in the hall, no complimentary water in the room, generally the impression is you are paying even for the air you breath. Breakfast is good although after a while you get bored. Of course the location is good because around there is everything you may need, and Victoria station for transportation. I know London is like this, and the other hotels are more or less the same, but this is not the service of a 4-star hotel of such a prestigious chain."
19,1040,"Aug 20 2009 	Vacation on London	A very good hotel, very central with good condition for leisure or business trip.The only critic i do is the fact of they make wedding cerimonis and the guest were vey noisy. I think the hotel must be more carefull.They have a good restaurant and the personal are very professional and nice with the guests."
20,1040,"Aug 17 2009 	Good central location but falls short of 4 star hotel	Did not get off to a good start when booking in! Despite producing e-mail confirmation from travel booking company confirming that account was to be charged to my employers (pre-arranged, as is the usual practice with our large organisation), receptionist insisted that I could not be allocated a room until I tendered my credit card! I explained that I was running late for an extremely important appointment and that payment had all been prearranged - she would not be convinced and said she would have to make some telephone enquiries. Her male colleague continually butted in to say that I could not be allocated a room until confirmation of payment was received - felt quite humiated by that point! I was then left hanging around reception for some considerable time until I had my employers intervene. Missed appointment - my sole reason for travelling to London and had to reschedule. Very poor customer service.Room was huge and bed clean and comfortable. Bathroom grubby with taps etc stained from previous occupants use. Tea/coffee tray but no frills such as biscuits, water etc, although there is an ice machine next to the lift. Had just emerged from the shower at 0845 hrs when cleaner knocked once and then marched into the room without waiting for an answer!Main lounge area next to reception is a pleasant place to relax but carpet is heavily stained and should be cleaned or replaced.On attending at restaurant for breakfast, which was included in tarriff, I was told there were no seats left and I would have to take my self service breakfast into lounge area and eat it at low coffee type table. Breakfast was okay but there was no sign of any staff behind the servery and a lot of items had not been replaced (9.00 am).All in all - yes I would return and give it another chance as it is really handy for Victoria train station and the Underground."
21,1040,"Aug 14 2009 	Pros and Cons 	We stayed here for 12 nights during August 2009.Pros: Concierges are very helpful; Rooms are modern and clean; 2minute walk to Victoria subway/bus/train station.Cons: No free wifi (available in nearby eateries); Older guests should be careful not to slip while entering/exiting the bathtub.Suggestions:The hotel is bounded on opposite sides by Wilton Street and by Vauxhill Bridge Road. On Wilton, within 3 blocks from the hotel are some very good restaurants--a. Grand Paradisio - Mediterranean, Spanish, and moreb. About Thyme - varietyc. Or, save lots of money buy getting take-out food/liquor from Sainsbury's grocery store.At Victoria Station, a good French restaurant is Chez Gerard.For good Chinese or Japanese food, try Chinatown (Gerard Street) not far from Leicester Square.If you're staying a few days, buy an Oyster card for discounted travel on subway, bus; renting a car is expensive and impractical if you're staying in London.Discount same-day theatre tickets from TKTS booth in the center of Leicester Square.British Natural History Museum - great exhibit dinosaur exhibit, but get there as soon as it opens, as the lines grow fast and long. British Museum is free and less crowded."
22,1040,"Aug 1 2009 	Fantastic Location Spacious Room So-So Service	I came to London alone and was so excited to explore the city. Being in Victoria, right next to the tube/train station was perfect for my traveling needs. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and I was so pleased with my room when first entering. I had heard hotel rooms in Europe were a bit smaller. But this room was comparable to anything in the states and the bathroom looked brand new. Unfortunately, the U.S. adaptor didn't work, the shower leaked heavily, there was no air conditioning, and a faulty light. I can't say the view is fantastic either.... After calling and have someone look at my shower I was able to move into another room and it was hassle free!! The people at the front desk are very friendly and I did love this hotel but without my package deal inclusive of travel, hotel stay, and theater I probably would have looked for a better value hotel."
23,1040,"Jul 30 2009 	Not perfect but convenient and generally very nice	My sister-in-law and I stayed at this hotel during our 5-day trip to London in July of 2009. We had a little bit of trouble finding the hotel initially after coming from the Victoria coach station, but that was mostly due to a poor map. Generally speaking, the location is extremely convenient as you can get anywhere you need to from Victoria station. The lobby of the hotel is very nice, although I have to say that check in was slow because the front desk was extremely busy. We arrived early afternoon - probably 1:00 or 2:00 pm - and got into our room right away which was very nice. The room was spacious, modern, and clean. We usually had no trouble at all with housekeeping, however one morning they seemed to have come in and made the beds without doing anything else. No new towels and the bathroom was still dirty. Also, we were disappointed that the hotel bar closed so early, but then so do all of the pubs in London. Finally, we were going to make use of the computers and internet access in the hotel lobby until we found out that the cost was 25 pence PER MINUTE. We found that to be absolutely ridiculous and decided not to use it. I can understand if a hotel charges to use their computers, but at least make it a reasonable rate! Anyway, I was however impressed when the hotel sent us a survey to complete when we arrived home and that they actually responded to my complaints. Hopefully improvements will be made in the future. Generally speaking, I would recommend this hotel. It is convenient, spacious, and modern - what more could you ask for?"
24,1040,"Jul 30 2009 	Great location	The hotel is conveniently located to Victoria Station and several small restaurants. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. The lighting in the rooms was not the best and the carpet throughout the hotel needs to be replaced. Perhaps they are waiting until it's closer to the Olympics? However, the room was clean, quiet, and comfortable with plenty of storage space. The breakfast in the Executive Room was good. We ate in the restaurant one night and had a late snack in the bar which were both enjoyable."
25,1040,"Jul 20 2009 	One should expect more from a four star hotel	This hotel can be easily found, just few steps from Victoria train station, which is very comfortable when you want to party in Vauxhall clubs.When I made my reservation I've emphasized my early (is it really early?) arrival at 12 o'clock, but unfortunately my room wasn't ready, I was asked to leave my luggage at concierge and came back at 2 o'clock. When I came back at 2 o'clock it occured that there was 30 people waiting at the reception desk to check-in.The concierge service can only offer storing your luggage, asked for booking the movie theatre tickets, bringing speakerphone to my room or ice-bucket was impossible for them.The rooms are spacious, but the sheet was ripped; there are lovely heated mirrors in the bathroom but the glass restraining water from leaking on the floor while taking a shower was hardly screwed which I noticed just before it could fall off and make same serious damage.Reasumming my stay in Park Plaza Hotel was full of unpleasant surprises :( I won't stay there again!"
26,1040,"Jul 14 2009 	SOUR STAY-EXPENSIVE HOTEL	My partner and I stayed at this hotel for three nights. From the minute we checked in, it was obvious that the front desk reception staff were untrained and unfriendly. It was as though we were imposing on them to let us stay there! We were so sorry to have arrived!Although the room itself was not bad, the lighting in the bathroom was deplorable. The cost of breakfast was astronomical, but luckily the hotel is near to several eating places and restaurants. In terms of location, its excellent-in terms of everything else, it certainly needs some positive team work, some staff upgrades and training...its better to stay at the Hesperia..which I will do from now on..."
27,1040,"Jul 11 2009 	Great staff running a mediocre facility	I stayed at this hotel for a few nights with two other family members in one room. Getting a triple accommodation in London is tough in my experience, but this place was quite flexible, offering a sofabed in a king room. The price was steep, typical of London, but the experience was not a great one. Let me say at the outset that the staff here are fantastic, but they have been given a mediocre hotel to run. It is hard to believe that the chain does not invest in the hotel to clean it up or replace worn furnishings, and the room design is simply awful. Although the rooms are adequately clean and the lobby is rather striking, the halls are filthy dirty and the &quot;executive breakfast room&quot; (only available for the higher priced rooms) looks worn out and frayed. The breakfast itself is pretty good, and the server was courteous and quite friendly. The first room we were given did not have a working AC unit, so we were quickly and efficiently moved to an apartment, which represented a free upgrade. I can't say this was a typical room, but it was not comfortable. The bed was poorly made up (I hate when too-small bottom sheets work their way out from the mattress and the bed ends up a mess). The lighting was annoying with only glaring ceiling spotlights that could not be used to read in bed. The wi-fi internet worked fine (extra charge - could not get the 1 hour free wired version to work, but they offered to come fix it right away had I wanted it). The location is great for the two Victoria area theaters (we picked up seats for Wicked from the box office right down the street, and Billy Elliot was playing around the corner). The hotel is a short walk to Victoria station and we were able to roll our copious luggage there and catch the Gatwick Express train with no problem. The Victoria area is a short walk to Big Ben, the Eye, the War Rooms museum, Buckingham Palace, Trafalger square etc, but you would want to take a cab back to the hotel after a west end theater show lets out at night (except for the two nearby theaters). All in all, this could be a great London hotel if the chain would invest in upkeep and interior upgrades. The staff is excellent, work hard, and deserve better."
28,1040,"Jul 7 2009 	Great Hotel - Definitely recommend it!	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while visiting London. The location was very convenient, an easy 5-10 minute walk to Victoria station and the rooms were clean and nice. I paid extra to have breakfast included and It was worth it. I was traveling with my 9 year old and I recommend it for families with kids."
29,1040,Jun 29 2009 	Good stay	We stayed for 1 night in June 09. Check in was efficient - we got into our room earlier than the 2 pm normal time. The room was comfortable - well lit - with a king size bed. We'd have been comfortable staying fro longer. Good bathroom. Everything clean. Friendly helpful staff. Victoria Station close by.
30,1040,"Jun 25 2009	great hotel great location	My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza reciently, we found the room clean and comfortable, the staff were helpful and friendly, the hotel is close to Victoria Station, and easy walk to attractions."
31,1040,"Jun 23 2009 	Hassle Free Hotel	I stay here regularly while on business in London. Its certainly not the plushest hotel out there but represents good value for money. The rooms are mid-sized with the usual amenities (desk, tv, small table, safe, etc) and always clean.The location is so-so.... Victoria is a bustling area but somewhat charachterless, although it is close to many of the major tourist attractions and very handy for the tube.The only complaint I had about this hotel was when I tried to look for a cable for the &quot;free internet&quot; I was told they were all in use. I was not best pleased... but after some strong words they agreed to enable the wireless access for me at no extra charge."
32,1040,Jun 18 2009 	Perfect weekend stay at the Victoria Park Plaza!	Me and my partner stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for only one night as we went there to see the show Wicked which was about 2 minutes from the hotel which is well worth seeing it if you will be staying there.. it was amazing!! The hotel was really nice and modern. My partner and i stayed in an executive room which was a really nice size and had a lovely bathroon and a huge bed that was so comfortable. The food was nice and the executive lougne was good as you get free drinks in there from 6pm-8pm ( guests in executive suites only). The hotel was just minutes away from victoria train station and victoria tube station and it was really easy to get to. I would deffinatly stay there again on my next trip into london.
33,1040,"Jun 15 2009 	Good Hotel	was fine for a business stay, and close to central london - victoria station/tube, long walk to the thames and buckingham palace. hotel was showing some signs of age: spots on floors, etc, but everyone was terrific, the place was clean, nice gym, and good food."
34,1040,"Jun 15 2009 	Great hotel and great location	We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Booked it because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor and as usual, we were not disappointed. So close to Victoria Station and lots of great restaurants and bars. The hotel staff were all very friendly and welcoming which is unusual for a city hotel. Our bedroom was on the 7th floor looking out to the back of the hotel so it was nice and quiet. The room was very spacious and the bed was extremely comfy!! We found the location to be very central for a lot of the touristy sights ( no tube travel required ) Great hotel."
35,1040,"Jun 14 2009 	underground access and walking distance to sights but no nightlife	Good price and my room was clean and quiet with a view over rooftops that I enjoyed. It was within (long) walking distance to many of the places I wanted to see, e.g. Buckingham Palace, Westiminster Abbey, etc. It was good for me but may be too long for some people, and definitely too long for children. It is right next to the train station, so it was easy to get to via the train and then underground from the airport, and it has easy access to the underground to other sights and areas (e.g. Tower of London, Picadilly Circus, West End.) All around the hotel however it is a very busy street scene with lots of construction and kind of run down with nothing happening at night. Also be warned they charge your credit card 75 pounds in advance at check in for incidentals, promising to re-credit the card 2-3 days afterwards minus the incidentals. All in all, it would be good for a single business traveler but for vacation next time I might look elsewhere. I suggest families look elsewhere for more space and friendlier street scenes."
36,1040,"Jun 13 2009 	Great Hotel close to theatre and train station	The Victoria Park Plaza was more that enjoyable for my stay in London. I only stayed one night and was going to see Wicked and this hotel is really just a block away which was very nice as it took just two minutes after the show went out to stroll back to the hotel. The rooms are very nice, with a great working AC, nice large bathroom and comfy beds. The walls were a bit thin and I could hear my neighbors during the day but they were quite at night.It is also very close to the Victoria Station which makes arriving and going around London very easy."
37,1040,"Jun 11 2009 	Enjoyable stay.	While not the best place I have ever stayed at, this hotel definitely holds its own. The rooms were very clean, if slightly sparse, and the hotel itself feels very modern. It is nearby many great restaurants and an easy walk to the theatres and to the underground station. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the woman who checked us in upgraded us to a king room... we aren't sure why, but we didn't argue! We stayed for only two nights at the end of our trip but I would absolutely stay here again."
38,1040,"May 29 2009 	Loved the Park Plaza	We stayed here for just one night but the hotel was such a refreshing change from other hotels in the city of London , It is in the heart of central London, close to Victoria station and looks new and beautiful, i booked through the secret hotels offer at lastminute .com after guessing that the hotel was the park plaza . The bathroom was huge and had a shower as well as a bath tub , i was amazed when i saw the size since London hotels can be so expensive and yet crunch up the space ! What i also loved was that the room had a full length mirror , wonder why so many hotel rooms miss on this. The staff was prompt and helpful. All in all a very pleasant stay."
39,1040,May 28 2009 	Definitely Would Stay Again	Great location. Great value. So central and handy. Definitely enjoyed my stay. If you book a room with the buffet breakfast included would recommend eating your breakfast in the restaurant rather than the executive room on Floor One (just more comfortable and spacious --- and the breakfast is the same).
40,1040,"May 24 2009 	Good hotel clean and modern rooms	I stayed in the Park Plaza hotel for a business trip, having a conference in the same hotel the following day. The hotel is literally a one minute walk away from Victoria train station so is ideal for those travelling by train. The hotel lobby is quite impressive, with plenty of staff available to deal with you. I stayed in an executive room that cost 160 for the night. The room was very nice and had obviously been recently renovated to a high standard. The room was very clean and the bed was large. There was every amenity that you could need for a business trip with Wi-Fi etc available. The room was quiet despite being above a busy road. The breakfast the following day was excellent. All of the staff that I spoke to during my stay were friendly. The conference facilities the following day were also good, they are situated below the main lobby area. I would recommend this hotel to those on business trips, but it would also be a good place to stay with your family if you are visiting London."
41,1040,"May 18 2009 	Highly Recommended and Excellent Value	A refreshing experience. All the staff, with which I had contact, were polite and knowledgeable. The tone of voice and body language was sincere, indicating their willingness to be of assistance.The rooms are well equipped, clean and very comfortable.The Hotel is situated in a very convenient part of the West End of London, close to many amenities.Most appreciated was the fact that the bar area remained open until the early hours, offering a wide selection of beverages and snacks.Dont look this one over when searching for accommodation in London."
42,1040,"May 16 2009 	Great Location So So Staff and Room	We stayed here 2 nights on our first trip to London. The location was great, we walked out of the train station and even with many bags ( thankfully hooked together &amp; on rollers) we were able to walk across the street and easily found the hotel after asking some train station employees having a smoke break outside. The room was a bit of a disappointment, I had payed extra for an Executive Room and thought it would be at least a little plush. It was on the first floor, poor view, had 2 beds as we had requested and was not spacious at all. There were 2 bottles of mineral water, 3 small &amp; beat up looking pieces of fruit and a box of 2 chocolates - filled with a powerful booze flavored filling that was nasty. The chocolates were not replaced the next day and that was fine. Our first night there, at 1 or 2AM it sounded like we were sitting over a noisy bar. Turns out the people next door were having a loud party. I called the desk &amp; they were good about sending someone to ask them to pipe down. The concierge, Peter, was very helpful but often occupied with other guests. An assistant tried to help me with advice on which tube to take to get to our desired attraction that day, but I needed more help &amp; better advice than he could give. He tried to help but gave me such complicated instructions - with too many options, that it almost did more harm than good. The bathroom was nice but a little worn, the mirror next to the tub was badly etched at the bottom - mirror type backing worn away. The spa toiletries were very cheap quality although packaged nicely. The bathrobes were extremely old &amp; scratchy. I would have been embarrassed to offer robes to wear of this condition to a guest. The lounge was nice enough, you are able to get coffee or tea throughout the day - although the coffee is from a push button type machine and not great. The creamer offered is like skim milk, no half &amp; half available. The snacks are offered from 8pm to 10, I am sure I saw 6 to 10 advertised but this is not the case. We were at the ballet on our first night, &amp; tried the lounge our 2nd evening there. Snacks consisted of slices of ham on a plate, and 2 bowls of cracker like munchies. There was wine available, and nice bottles of beer &amp; cans of soda in the cooler. Maybe there were more snacks available earlier but they ran out, although we were in the lounge by 6:30. I got the breakfast from the lounge on our first morning &amp; was able to get a plate &amp; bring it back to my son, who wanted to sleep in that day. Most of the items looked pretty good, but the bin of scrambled eggs looked gray, undercooked and unappetizing. They were out of pastries except for toast. The other items were ok, not great, I would say this breakfast is worth 5 or 10 dollars. We had it because it came with the price of the room, but I would have been disappointed had I payed their ala carte price for it. The 2nd day we went down to the restaurant and the offerings were much better there, and there was adequate seating. In the lounge, all the tables were either occupied or full of old dishes, so taking it all back to our seemed the only option. The eggs were the same gray &amp; slimey looking concoction downstairs, but there were also fried eggs, potatoes, sausage &amp; ham as well as some very nice pastries &amp; fresh fruit. I would advise skipping the lounge location entirely for breakfast, the food is better in the restaurant the staff more helpful.I would stay here again if the price were right. The location is great and just a block away from 2 theaters, where Wicked and Billy Elliott were playing. We were busy &amp; only here for 2 nights, perhaps if I had bothered to ask we would have been given a better Executive room. The down points on this hotel is that it is so big and impersonal, and most of the staff seem apathetic &amp; not service oriented. London is expensive, so I suppose for what we payed (going through expedia) around $500 US for 2 nights including tax was not terrible. Still, for what we payed I did expect more."
43,1040,"May 15 2009 	Loved the hotel location staff and atmosphere!	This hotel made a hectic start to a long vacation much easier than anticipated! My flight arrived to London at 7 in the morning and check-in was at 2 PM. I asked the front desk if we could check in early, and thankfully, we got a room upon arrival! The room was incredibly clean, the bathrooms were modern, and the beds extremely comfortable. What was even more convenient: the electrical outlets! They were American plugs and already converted. The service and staff was great as well. The location is great, Victoria station is just a short walk away. My one complaint would be the expensive internet BUT....right down the street is a great little cafe called &quot;Pret a Manger&quot; that offers free wi-fi."
44,1040,"May 12 2009 	Perfectly fine	Stayed here for a business trip and was very pleased. The hotel is in a good location for Victoria and as a base for striking out towards Westminster.Check in was quick, efficient and friendly. My room was of a good size, clean and tidy and had the usual amenities (tea &amp; coffee making facilities, mini bar, safe, air con etc).The bed was very comfortable and the standard of dcor very good. The bathroom was of a decent size and it had a luxurious power shower which was just the thing in the morning.I ate in the restaurant at both Breakfast and Dinner. Breakfast was busy but I was seated quickly and there was an excellent variety of food on offer, from pastries, fruit, cereals up to a full English, and the standard of food was very good. In the evening service was good although it took a little while for the food to come out of the kitchen and it wasn't particularly busy. Also, be aware that in the evening a discretionary service charge is added to your bill automatically, which I think is a tad cheeky. I queried this and it was removed from my bill without question.On the whole, a very pleasant stay and very professional staff. I would stay here again."
45,1040,"May 6 2009 	Attentive Service and Comfort in the Heart of London	The staff at this hotel set it apart from the rest. The Reception and Concierge desks were always well-manned and the staff polite, smartly dressed and well-informed. A request for a quiet room was efficiently dealt with and was accompanied by a warm smile - all too often a rarity in hotels in this country.The dining room staff were equally attentive and professional and the breakfast banquet a feast for sore eyes. Although our Expedia package was on a room only basis, we opted for the hotel breakfasts. By paying in advance at check-in there was a reducion on the normal charge but even despite this saving breakfast represented wonderful value with everything on offer from fresh fruit of every description to the traditional 'fry-up'.Our bedroom was spacious with pleasing decor and the bathroom stocked with quality toiletries and even bathrobe and slippers.The location of this hotel is ideal for anyone wishing to visit the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey as the nearest Underground station, Victoria, (which is a leisurely 4 minutes' walk from the hotel), is only a couple of stops away.This hotel not only gets the thumbs up for comfort and location but for its excellent well-trained staff all of whom look as if they actually enjoy making your stay memorable for all the right reasons."
46,1040,May 6 2009 	Coool Plaza...	I had visited Park Plaza and stayed there on my 1st business trip to London. Park Plaza had been selected as it is situated at a stone's throw distance from Victoria underground station. My experience had been wonderful as the hotel and the rooms were well appointed and the representatives at the reception too had been very cooperative in providing valuable tourist information during my stay. The bar had fabulous lighting with all of the global drinks served. My friends and me had a gr8 time singing and drinking all night at the bar located at the lobby level. The breakfast served was continental and english which was also relishing too. I would definitely visit the hotel once more on my next trip to London......
47,1040,"Apr 29 2009 	Great location - expensive internet.	Park Plaza Victoria is a nice, modern 4-star hotel only a few minutes walk from Victoria Station and close to Buckingham Palace, theatres, Big ben etc. Nice rooms, bathroom with amenities, good restaurant, fitness center, spa etc. and reasonable prices. Only downside was the lacking of free wi-fi."
48,1040,"Apr 17 2009 	Easter holidays at the Park Plaza Victoria	The hotel is really very well located, a minute from Victoria Station and a short walk from Buckingham Palace or The Westminster Abbey. The room is quite big, very confortable bed and pilows, huge wardrobe. Coffee and tea facilities, there is a minibar but guarantee is requiered. The bathroom with a nice bath-tub. Good staff, very efficient reception and concierge staff. Breakfast ok a bit busy but normal taking into account is a bank holiday + weekend."
49,1040,"Apr 2 2009 	No complaints!	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break. Booked the Executive package with use of Executive Lounge (free snacks and drinks for two hours in the evening plus beverages and snacks available throughout the day) and English Breakfast thrown in, which was one of the best I have tasted in London. Hotel is in a great location with transport links just up the road and we found the staff pleasant and helpful throughout our stay. The hotel also has a spa which we will make use of next time we stay. The room we had was roomy and the bathroom had a stand-in shower/bath. On the whole very clean and well presented. Some people are complaining about the car parking situation. We found a 24 hr secure car park about a 10 minute walk away and if you are taking in a show (at selected theatres, check out Westminster website for details), present your parking ticket for validation and get half price parking. Bargain! I have yet to check my credit card statement for the 25 charge  hopefully I wont have to claim it back."
50,1040,"Mar 30 2009 	Unclean and unpleasant.	I stayed at this hotel and I was not at all impressed. Although it was nicely decorated, I found the bathroom to be unclean. The shower and floors were full of hairs, and I found the experience unpleasant. Also in the bar near the reception the tables were rather dirty, as were the toilets for this area. When you are paying the price for a decent hotel, the least you expect is cleanliness. Some of the staff were a little rude as well. I got dirty looks for wearing my jeans, but i didn't feel it necessary to wear my evening gown for sightseeing.The only good thing about this hotel is the location, it is literally around the corner from Victoria station, which makes it easy to go out and about.In my opinion this hotel is trying to be something it is not. Once they've cleaned the place, and made it a pleasant stay, then maybe they deserve their stars, but as it is I will definitely not be returning."
51,1040,"Mar 27 2009 	Nice hotel but a complete rip off!!	I booked this hotel for me and my girlfriend as it was her birthday. Got a fair deal through last minute.com for one night stay in the hotel and 2 tickets to Madame Tussauds. We drove 3 hours to the hotel only for them to say there was NO parking spaces available. We then decided to go to Madame Tussauds in the mean time. After Madame Tussauds we decided to go back to the hotel to see if there were ANY parking spaces available. When we asked if there were any parking spaces available, we were told there were but we would have to PAY 30 A NIGHT! to stay in the hotels own car park! As we had no choice, we accepted. When we arrived at reception we were told we would get charged '25 pre-authorisation' for any items which were removed from the mini-bar, which is fair enough. When wew went up to our hotel room to check our bank balance, we found out we got charged 125! We told reception and they said it waws done by a mistake on they're behalf (no apology) and that when we checked out, this amount would be canceled and the amount owed would be charged. I was told that as soon as the pre-authorisation was canceled my funds would be made available immediately. Checked out, drove home, found that the amount was not canceled and that I now have to WAIT 2-5 WORKING DAYS for the amount to be canceled. LONG STORY SHORT, DONT DRIVE UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY 30 A NIGHT TO STAY IN THE HOTELS OWN CAR PARK, AND WHEN HANDING OVER YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD, CHECK VERY VERY CAREFULLY FOR THE AMOUNT THEY ARE CHARGING AS IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET IT BACK!! (also, air conditioning didn't work properly and very very poor workmanship done in barthroom)"
52,1040,"Mar 27 2009 	Enjoyable Stay	I stayed at this hotel in January, 09, for 8 days and I don't have any complaints, our plan included continental breakfast, we basically had breakfast and was gone for the day. The staff was wonderful,and helpful in directing us on getting around to the attractions. The Hotel is located about 5 minutes away from the Victoria Tube &quot;train&quot; Station, and within walking distance to many of the main tourist attractions, and two theaters. We saw &quot;Wicked ' at the Apollo and it was GREAT.There are also eatery/shope at the train station, restaurants of different etnicity close by and grocery shops. At the train station we chose the three day pass, we also bought tickets from the Original tour bus &quot;hop on hop off tour&quot; and were able to see a lot of the attractions on our list, there are three routes the tour buses travel and they are entwined with the major attractions, the ticket also included the River Thames day cruise . We bought tickets for the London Eye, but were unable to use them because the &quot;Eye had mechanical problems.We also did two days of bus tours with Evan &amp; Evans, they have different tours, so it's base on individual preferences. for tour 1, We chose Leeds Castle, Dover and Canterbury Cathedral, and tour 2, Windsor Castle, StoneHedge and Bath. the tour guides were great. I really had a great time."
53,1040,"Mar 26 2009 	Warm service and comfortable rooms	The hotel had a great entrance and its proximity to the Victoria Station is very useful. The service was above expectations, the concierge was thoughtful and very well-versed. I was pretty impressed. The room was comfortable and well done up. Decent value for money."
54,1040,"Mar 16 2009 	Good quality/price ration hotel	good position for the tube and connections with Gatwick airportThe room was really large and comfortable, but was too hot and we couldn't manage the heating."
55,1040,"Mar 15 2009 	Nice place good location	I got a great Internet deal on Expedia, which knocked about $100 off of the rack rate, otherwise, it's a bit expensive. But if you can get a deal, take it, since it's a great place. It's really clean, the bed is very comfy, and the restaurant is good. Its location is awesome too: a one minute walk from Victoria Station, 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, and 5 minute walk to Cardinal Place, a shopping and dining area which has a Wagamama. Also, it's in a prime location for a lot of the theater district; Wicked and Billy Elliot were playing next door. Negatives: Internet is expensive; no alarm clock so we had to rely on wake-up calls, which they got wrong the first morning."
56,1040,Mar 15 2009 	It's great hotel	I and my wife has stayed at Park Plaza for our 2 days vacation in London and the hotel is great. The room is clean and very close to Victoria train station so it's convenience for us to go around London for sightseeing and enjoy our vacation. Staff is nice to us both and very helpful.I would stay here again for our next vacation in London.
57,1040,"Mar 12 2009 	3 star sauna !	A supposedly 4 star deluxe hotel that should be marketed as a 3 star sauna not a hotel. My wife and I arrived for a weekend of work and pleasure. Unfortunately, due to the hotel's air conditioning being on winter mode and controlled by the hotel, we were unable to alter the unit in our room, which made spending time in it unbearable, as it was like sitting in a sauna. We were unable to sleep the first night ,which after a long journey getting to the hotel, spoilt our weekend.After complaining again the following morning, we were moved to a different room, which had no direct sunlight and with a large window which could be opened to let in fresh air.To be fair to the reception and concierge staff, they were polite and helpful and themselves could not understand why the system was functioning as it was, as it was a mild 13 deg celcius outside with plenty of sunshine. They had also received many similar complaints that same day.The food in the hotel is quite good, but the location means that you need to take a tube or taxi anywhere in London worth going to.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they were planning to visit victoria station every day."
58,1040,"Mar 10 2009 	Had a great time	I choose this hotel because of the location and from the ratings. There are lesser priced hotels in the area, but the reviews for those were a little more mixed (too noisy/no heat/no service/no lift/no water) and I didn't want to take the risk.This hotel has a great location. Close to Victoria Station which has sereval Tube a Bus connections. There a couple of theaters, reaturants, pubs, and clubs with in 10 minutes walk. You can walk to Westminster Abbey and Trafalgar square, but if you're a little out of shape like me, it is easy enough to catch the 11 bus from Victoria station. The room was spacious and clean. Large bathroom with huge and soft towels. The bed was soft and comfortable with clean sheets. A/C and heat worked well and made no noise. The room had outlets for all types of plugs including U.S. standards. We didn't hear any street noise despite the closeness of Victoria Station (it is bustling 24 hours a day). I have to admit the walls were a bit thin and could have been a problem if the neighbors were rowdy. Fortunately, ours were quiet.Staff is available 24/7 and were eager and enthusiastic in helping. Sometimes making them understand what you needed was a bit difficult. We did call on them quite a bit to help out with getting our outlets to work, getting recommendations, setting up reservations, etc. The only problem I had was one morning I asked for additional towels and none showed up after 30 minutes.As to the food, skip it. I can't attest to the quality, but at the prices they were asking I didn't want to bother. There are plenty of cafes, pubs, and quality restaurants with in 5 minutes walk. I would recomend this hotel for fellow mid-lifers who like their comforts and don't want to take a risk on the type of room you get at one of the cheaper hotels."
59,1040,"Mar 8 2009 	Good enough!	I stayed for one night at the Park Plaza Victoria. Excellent location, just a block from Victoria Station. Polite and professional staff at the reception. Spacious and modern-looking lobby with a comfortable bar. Clean and spacious room (specially considering London average!). Decent and non-pretentious room decor. Quietness (at least in my room, which was on the 4th floor and faced an ample, interior courtyard). The mattress was perhaps a little too soft for me. The bathroom was clean and not too small. As other travellers have noted, the bath-screen is too short... One oddy thing: the hair-dryer is outside the bathroom, in the closet (there is a mirror next to it).Breakfast (continental, included in rate) was quite good; except for the tea and the coffee (but these hardly ever are good with hotel breakfasts...)."
60,1040,"Mar 4 2009 	Best Bit Was The Time Spent Outside the Hotel	Items went missing from the room. Manager was especially condescending and unhelpful. Problem never got resolved and due to the amount paid for the room as well as the four star rating of the hotel, this was a surprise. Management were too busy protecting their staff from getting into trouble rather than attending to the needs of the guest and the fact a theft had taken place. Legal action is considered. Police were not called in out of respect for the hotel and the hope that the missing items would turn up, this however did not happen and I find it hard to believe that the hotel staff even tried. Safe was not working in room, towels and bed linen was not clean either. This however was not reported as the four star rating led me and my partner to believe that the safe would not be needed and we didnt want to be a hassle with regard to the odd stain on the bed linen and towels. Important items were therefore kept hidden within the personal property of myself and my partner. The items should not have been found as they were hidden, the staff clearly ttok them. When this was mentioned on a follow up call from management, it was dismissed and blame was laid with myself for not using the safe. The night manager was rude and highly unhelpful and only shared any information when he knew the hotel could not be held responsible. Ruined the entire trip, hotel was a rip off and will never stay in it or a sister hotel if possible. Staff during breakfast seated us as far away as possible from other guests in the restaurant even though other tables were available and continued to clear and reset tables around us nosily and disruptively and made us feel unwelcome. This was a complete let down and the entire hotel was a disappointment. When checking in the room was not ready even though early check in was requested due to an extremely early flight. When we returned at a later time than suggested so as to give the staff more time, the room still was not ready. The check in staff were not easy to work with and did not go out of their way to help us. They clearly only did what was in their exact job description. When the room was finally ready to enter, no help was given or offered with baggage. The first morning of the room being cleaned was also shabby and messy. Apart from a well made bed, the rest was a shambles. Tea bags and milk were not replaced, the toiletries were strewn around, and towels were taken and not replaced even though they were folded and not on the floor as requested if you wanted them changed, glasses were cleaned but left in the bathroom and the floor was not cleaned. The description of the hotel also leads one to believe they are much nearer to Big Ben, the River Thames and Westminster than it actually is and this should be removed from the website immediately to stop other people wasting their money. Not a good experience. The entire place needs an overhaul and it needs to build a feeling of being welcome rather than just their to spend money. Everything including a morning paper is a charge and for the money you pay, its not worth it. I am still waiting for a response from the manager about the stolen goods and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. London was fab but the hotel BRUTAL."
61,1040,"Feb 28 2009 	terrific London hotel	I stay there 2 months a year, in 1 week chunks. Location is unbeatable, rooms and bathrooms are spacious, the executive club room is convenient w/free snacks and drinks, and returning clients enjoy personalized service, free morning paper to room, etc. Wonderful young staff, all aiming to please altho occasionally baffled."
62,1040,"Feb 25 2009 	Nice hotel with clinical atmosphere	The Park Plaza Victoria is located less than 5 minutes away from Victoria Station, which is most convenient, particularly as there are not too many (nice) hotels in the area. The hotel is modern, the rooms are clean and relatively spacious compared to other London hotels. However, already the reception area, but also the rooms and even the restaurant lack of atmosphere. We couldn't help feeling a little bit like in a hospital.Otherwise the hotel is nice and recommendable; sometimes pricey, but often not too expensive either. It is most recommendable if you need to be close to Victoria and if you travel with children, as the hotel has suites and apartments that can accommodate families as well.The breakfast was not very tasty, I have to say, and the service was not really attentive or particularly friendly. Whereas the receptionist at check-in was very helpful and welcoming, the receptionist who was on duty when we left was most unfriendly and did not even say goodbye when we left."
63,1040,"Feb 23 2009 	Perfect one night stay to watch a Musical	We got a great deal for the Park Plaza and had no expectations, except for those you generally have of London hotels which is generally poor and overpriced. We booked the overnight parking at 30 and were told to park outside and the concierge would help. This was the only disappointing side to our stay and the hotel needs to do more for guests on this part. After queuing for a while for the concierge we finally sussed that we had to reverse back up to a lift - there are no signs for this and you immediately drive past it.... It was a little scary driving into the lift and then finding a space.However, checkin was very good and we were speeding up to our room in minutes. The room was very clean and fresh, with good facilities and a clean shower and toilet. We went to see Wicked which is practically next door to the hotel so it was perfect for that stay. When my husband responded to a questionnaire with comments about the parking he received an apology from the Manager - which in my books is good customer service - I just hope they act on it.I would recommend the hotel for short stays in London, it is ideally placed for the most of the Shows and has some good restaurants around as well."
64,1040,"Feb 19 2009 	Good location nice large rooms - but nothing extraordinary!	Stayed at the Park Plaza Victoria for three nights in December. Booked the hotel based on good reviews and it looked like a clean and neat hotel. A lot of hotels in London look really dodgy and I wanted something nice, but affordable. I think we paid about 130 a night, okay - but I'm not sure whether I think it was good value.It is situated close to the Victoria station (very handy if you are flying from Gatwick). The area around Victoria Station is a bit busy, but there are some nice and more quiet side streets with restaurants, bars and cafs. We had some trouble finding the entrance of the hotel. The building does not look very much like a hotel, it's just a plain business-like building. It felt like a hotel aimed at businesspeople as well - professional and unpersonal. The reception area is very nice, and the bar/restaurant looked good as well - we didn't eat there though so I cannot comment on the food/drinks. The staff were professional and nice. We arrived a bit early but were given a room straight away at the 6th floor. The room was large and there was lots of space, which is nice and quite unusual for London hotels?! Based on previous reviews we did not have the best room! No chocolate or fruit in our room! There was a hairdryer, minibar, safe and television. But the hairdryer was awful - there was no real on/off button so you had to keep pushing the button to keep it going, my thumb was aching after a few minutes so I had to give up - it also smelled awful (overheated, burnt) and there was no real power so I would have to stand there for ages! The bathroom was nice, but some places like the bath tub looked dirty - it might've been flaking paint but it still looked gross. The bed was comfy and we had a nice view from our hotel room, down to the busy street below, roof tops and we could get a glimpse of London Eye as well. Despite being a lot of traffic outside of the hotel we were never bothered by any noise. My only real complaint is the internet access, it was incredibly expensive!!! I think it was  20 a day! I've stayed at lots of hotel and never had anything close, and at this room rate the wireless net should be free! The location is great as it is possible to walk to Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street.. and the tube is just minutes away! The Apollo Theatre is nearby and there are lots of restaurants, cafes and bars in the area. Good area to stay in!All in all, Park Plaza Victoria a good hotel with nice, spacey rooms - but that's it! We might stay here again, but there are probably better hotels charging the same or lower price than Park Plaza!"
65,1040,Feb 10 2009 	Nice bed. Terrible artwork and finishes in rooms	Staff at front desk average. Room spacious but little details like incorrectly directed lights and door handles which were impossible to open very annoying.They sprayed a room with some sort of chemical down the hall and then stunk everything up. Not very nice for our young baby.Area is average but convient to the train station.Breakfast is average as well. Nothning special for a hotel breakfast.Room faced onto noisy building works.Would stay again but for the price they asked would also consider similar hotels in better locations.
66,1040,"Jan 29 2009 	Perfect Location for a little bit of everything	We spent our first three days in London here and the hotel was just perfect. I had booked with the hotel and received their business class upgrade, and that gave us access to the business lounge - which had complimentary breakfast and a 'happy hour' of sorts. It was so great to come back after a long day of sightseeing and go for a glass of wine or beer in the lounge and have a few snacks (oysters, crackers, cheese etc). One night this was our dinner as we were late for the theatre. the front staff was very accomodating, and I would definitely stay here again."
67,1040,"Jan 28 2009 	Excellent - no problems at all (single night)	Here with my better half for a single night prior to a business meeting and really couldn't fault the place. Very pleasant front desk staff who changed our room without complaint when we found we'd been booked a twin rather than a double. Quite large room, spotlessly clean and extremely comfy bed. We were on the 7th floor, sort of on the side of the building, so it was very quiet during the night too. Another big plus was the breakfast, which was one of the best experienced in a London business class hotel - self service admittedly, but a cracking full English - all well cooked and tasted like proper food as opposed to much of the horrid bland stuff many similar hotels manage to serve up !Very good conference centre on the lower ground floors too. Would certainly stay here again and it's perfect for Victoria station and for Victoria Apollo theatre where we got last minute cheap tickets to see &quot;Wicked&quot; - audience full of kids but a good show nonetheless."
68,1040,"Jan 5 2009	Decent hotel inefficient front desk staff / check-in procedures	The hotel itself was nice and clean. The rooms were good size and the beds comfortable. The water pressure was good and the bathrooms in good condition. The internet rate we paid was very good.The front desk staff was another matter. They appeared confused, disorganised and unable to communicate clearly. They need to improve the booking and checking in systems / procedures for staff. Our simple on- line prepaid booking of 7 rooms caused chaos. The staff did not know what to do, the check-in took much longer than necessary. They were not communicating what we were expected to do, they kept disappearing from the desk and not explaining whether they wanted us to wait, etc. The staff would greatly benefit from customer care training and a list of standard questions / text for checking in. Then the credit card was billed incorrectly - more than once. I had to have more than one conversation with the accounts dep. to sort this out.Overall  the hotel was very nice, but make sure you get a clear explanation from the front desk what they are billing you for and at what rate, or you might get a nasty surprise when your credit card bill comes through."
69,1040,Jan 4 2009 	Basic 4* hotel near Victoria Station	Stayed there 2 nights for New Year's Eve. Choosed this hotel first for its location and its price.Booked through booking.com and got a Superior (Standard) Double Room for 303 the 2 nights including taxes but no breakfast. Hotel is non-smoking which is good for us 2.Room on 4th floor was ok for the size but bathroom was rather small. Bed was King size but old and not comfortable at all. Didn't like it as well as the pillow. TV was not a flat one so for a 4* hotel in London it's old fashioned I think for the price you pay.Staff was ok.Good thing is the location near Victoria Station when arriving with the Gatwick Express. Tube and Buses really nearby.Shops and bars around as well as a good pub Wetherspoon's. Internet caf nearby also. Try the Wagamama for dinner.Don't go there unless you get a good price.
70,1040,"Jan 3 2009	Great Staff yet overpriced	We stayed here to get to a Southend United and Arsenal FC match. This hotel is overpriced. Not only per night, but for any amenity you usually have to shell out a lot of money to stay comfortable. If you are looking to save money, do not go to this hotel. The staff was incredibly nice, and gave us smart travel tips, the rooms were comfortable and the lobby and rooms were very stylish and pretty. Altogether a good hotel if you don't find spending too much money."
71,1040,"Jan 2 2009 	parking a joke	I would like to pass on my experience on staying at this hotel.I would firstly like to mention about the parking situation which i think is disgusting when i asked where to park the car it was said cant park at hotel no spaces available so will have to park on the roadside alongside the hotel which we did .After parking in this space for about twenty minutes just to allow us to take belongings to our accomodation we arrived back at the car to find a penalty ticket of forty pounds.When we approached the hotel staff regarding the penalty they just said well you can park in NCPcar park which is situated about ten minutes down the road there were no apologies that we couldnt park on the hotel premises which i think that is the least they could do,when you book in at a hotel you expect a parking space.Not at any point does it state on the internet where i booked this reservation that the parking is very limited or you may have to park down the road.Secondly when i booked this reservation i booked two rooms with QUEEN BEDS only to find the both rooms had two single beds how can this be A QUEEN BED?So i would like to say not an enjoyable experience had by all of us,AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!"
72,1040,"Dec 25 2008	Great Weekend	My wife and I spent two nights at the Park Plaza last weekend. This was our first visit to this hotel as we normally stay at the Cavendish in Mayfair. However, We needed to be near to Victoria Station this visit so we chose the Park Plaza because of its proximity and on the strength of reviews on Tripadvisor. The location was perfect for our needs as it was literally a two minute walk to the station and there was a reasonable choice of restaurants and bars in the immediate area. We were pleased to find our room was ready when we arrived shortly after midday. The room itself was spacious, clean and had everything you would expect from a four star hotel.We didn't have breakfast as part of our package but we used the bar three times for drinks and found the service excellent and reasonably -priced. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and efficient. In fact we had no complaints whatsoever and will certainly stay at this hotel again in the future."
73,1040,"Dec 20 2008 	Excellent!	I have just returned from four nights at the hotel and would thoroughly recommend it.The staff were friendly and helpful and we had a huge, modern, clean room with lots of facilities. There was a range of toiletries, bath robe, ironing board, iron, fruit, chocolates etc.The continental breakfast was also good, with a selection of juices, pastries, cereals, meats and cheeses.I think the hotel is excellent value for money and will definately go back!"
74,1040,"Nov 30 2008 	Nice room terrible concierge	The hotel is lovelty, comfortable and spacious, ,but, and this is quite a major grumble for me, the lack of help with parking. I was charged 30 for overnight parking and the concierge gave me a ticket and mumbled some directions to me and i then had to squeeze my car into a car lift and figure out how to use the lift, park up then find my way pack up the reception. For a hotel of this type am i wrong to expect someone to take my car into the car lift and park it up for me and then bring it to the front of the hotel when i check out? ( for 30, a not unreasonable expectation) Maybe it was because i was not wearing a suit, maybe it was because i have a scouse (liverpool) accent, maybe it is not hotel policy or maybe they could not be bothered, that said, they were all smiles and helpfulness for the french airline staff who turned up as i struggled back to reception with my suitcase to find my wife........."
75,1040,"Nov 28 2008 	Business Location Great but Otherwise Totally Disappoints	Stayed at this hotel 5 nights (Sun-Thurs.) on business in September, 2008. Spent week working just 5 blocks away, so an easy walk in the Victoria Station area. I can think of 3 nice things to say so let's start with the good 1. Very quiet...I didn't hear noise from adjoining rooms nor from street below. 2. Bath was spacious and well supplied with toiletries. 3. One of the concierge employees was outstanding and arranged dispatch of car and pickup of my partner at Heathrow Airport. Was my partner's first time traveling international so was really concerned about him getting safely to the hotel but they arranged perfectly.But the downsides are numerous: thick dust in 1/2 inch margin between the floor moldings and carpet - so really noticeable. Burn holes in the drapery liner and poor lighting to boot. When I went to ask for desklamp the frontdesk said &quot;we don't have any&quot;...shocking for a place that bills itself as a business hotel and so I had no choice but to settle for dim, recessed ceiling lights. Overall I would not recommend this hotel and would recommend that it be at best, a last resort in the area."
76,1040,"Nov 23 2008 	Great stay after a few hiccups resoved	The hotel is literally 3 minute walk from victoria station with a huge sign of WICKED next to it :) We arrived just before 2pm and i was told by recepetionist Sigfried that our room was not ready and wont be til 2. After going back at 2pm, Sigfried again, i was still told that our room wont be ready and will take a further 20 minutes to clean. I was a little annoyed as these rooms arent totally cheap and you are paying from 2pm onwards til 12am the next day. i finally went back at 2:30ish and he said our room was not ready still, by another person, and went out the back for a minute. he came back and said he has put us in another room. And i had to ask. what room is that? he said it was a studio room as apposed to our standard room. I asked what the difference was as he didnt mention it as i didnt want to be ripped off. He said it was a bigger room. We went up to the room straight away to unload our stuff and the room was pretty big as i expected it to be much smaller yet still good. Water was set out with fruit and chocolate which was compliments of the hotel. The tv had a message with my name on it which was kind of cool. Had a couch and desk if we needed it. The aircon didnt put out cold air but its winter so we just opened a window. The bed was massive,it must of been a king. The breakfast was great and we needed the buffet to fuel us for the day before we went back. overall i think the experience was good other than the checking in bit. Overall good and i'd recommend it. If your rooms not ready chances are you'll be upgraded and if you arent kick up a fuss as your paying from 2pm. we left at 12ish and paid the normal room rate which should of been more but thanks to the upgrade it was a good rate. I would recommend this to my friend so book today and go see wicked as the temp singer is amazing and i think better than the original."
77,1040,"Nov 16 2008 	A splendid place	A wonderful hotel. Nice breakfast. Lovely evening meals. Splendid cafe but shut Saturday and Sunday. had the most exceptionally delicious gateaux and coffee. Good at reception desk. Rooms were so spacious and homely. Nice situation as well. Near to new shopping centre, Buckingham Palace and the theatres for Wicked and Billy Elliott. Marks and Spencers nearby and Victoria Station. Taxis and everything you could wish for."
78,1040,"Nov 9 2008 	Nice hotel shame about the bar staff	We stayed in an executive room which was spacious and pleasant, also well worth the price.Great location and there's plenty of nice bars and restaurants nearby.Breakfast would have been okay had we not been vegetarians, as the veggie option was lacking to say the least - egg on toast was about the size of it, which certainly wasn't worth the cost.The only big complaint was the attitude of the bar staff. They were rude, slow and more interested in talking to each other than serving us our (rather overpriced) drinks.Their lack of customer service is the only thing that would put me off staying at this hotel again."
79,1040,"Nov 4 2008 	Fine stay - would recommend.	My wife &amp; I spent 3 nights in Sept. 2008 on vacation. Chose this hotel based on price, TripAdvisor reviews, and location. We also booked tickets to see Wicked and the proximity of the theater seemed like a bonus.I was on business mid-week in the City - stayed at the Crowne Plaza - VERY NICE. But heard the City was boring on weekends since many shops close when the business people aren't there. We didn't want to get stuck in dullsville on the vacation portion of our trip!I'll admit I was disappointed having just come from the Crowne Plaza. But don't forget - we were paying a lot less than the Crowne Plaza - I don't believe the hotels are even the same class. I kept asking the staff when we first arrived - is this really an Executive Room? Good size, but very plain - not well appointed. From afar - the hotel looked very nice, but on close inspection everything seemed in slight disrepair. Very much like the Victoria area itself - a little dingy/grimier than other parts of the city we visitied. A lot of contruction going on around the hotel (although I was never bothered by noise). The walk towards West Minster Abbey &amp; Parliment was a little dreary - your average working business district found in most cities (fast food, convenience stores, other misc. shops you won't go into). Overall we had a very pleasant stay here - no complaints. Convenient to transportation. We found the staff helpful &amp; nice. We ate at several nearby restaurants and had great meals everywhere.One shining feature of the PPV was the Executive Suite! Snacks, beer, wine, sodas in the evening and breakfast every morning. It wasn't fine dining, but when you're traveling about the city all day - this was a real welcome treat at key moments when you need it most! And again - the staff running the Suite were very nice and attentive. I would definitely recommend upgrading to the Executive Room for this."
80,1040,"Oct 30 2008 	Very very bad	Stayed at the Park Plaza Victoria from 24th - 27th October. I booked the room through the hotel web-site then emailed to request an extra bed for the Sat. and Sun. nights (got a confirmation email back). 3rd bed was confirmed at check-in. It did not arrive until 1am Sunday morning! Staff were then very rude, dismissive, insulting, made insulting and sarcastic 'phone calls and told lies. I agreed a level of compensation with the Duty Manager on Sunday morning, which was then refused by the Front-of-house Manager on Monday, saying it agreement never happened, even though it was witnessed by three of my friends. I was then threatened with legal action when I refused to pay.It is incredible that this level of behaviour is tolerated by any company, let alone one that depends on customer satisfaction so directly."
81,1040,"Oct 23 2008 	Poor Cust Service	We just returned from a great trip to the UK. We ended our trip at the Park Plaza Victoria, which is unfortunate since the attitude of the staff nearly ruined the entire trip. Our reservations were made a couple of months in advance through Orbitz. When we arrived the Duty Manager was extremely rude and made inappropriate comments. The hotel was very nice &amp; clean; however, when a member of management is rude to guests, the overall level of customer service diminishes for all employees. I would not recommend this hotel, nor would I stay there in the future."
82,1040,Oct 20 2008 	Good value hotel	The rooms were spacious and very clean and modern. The people at the desk were very helpful and courteous. The location was excellent. It was a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station and 10 minutes from Victoria Coach where buses are available to take you to Heathrow airport.
83,1040,"Oct 2 2008 	Good	Have used the Victoria when couldn't get into its sister hotel at Riverbank. It is not as good as the Riverbank with older, less well equipped rooms but it still is much better than average. In a good location behind Victoria Station with many good restaurants and pubs in the area behind the hotel (Pimlico). Breakfast is good."
84,1040,"Sep 29 2008 	Great Location and Comfortable!	While not located in a restaurant area, it is so close to Victoria Station (and the Gatwick express) that its convenience outweighs its neutral location. We had a huge room with a king bed - extremely comfortable beds and pillows. In-room safe, and a hair dryer that actually works. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower and tub. We had a little couch, desk &amp; chair, and separate chair and table - spacious! We also had a mini-welcome basket with fruit and chocolates. The front desk wanted to upsell us with an &quot;executive&quot; package - for breakfast and additional amenities which did not seem to be a good deal. This was a great business hotel, with a comfortable lobby/bar for a night cap. When asked for restaurant recommendations, the front desk said their own restaurant (which I find cheesy to do). Wetherspoons was around the corner, and breakfast is cheap and good there. Again, while not in a restaurant area, it is very close to the musical theatres, and Victoria station. Great place to grab a taxi, the underground or a quick baguette and coffee. Overall, the location and quality of this hotel was exceptional for the price we paid."
85,1040,"Sep 25 2008 	Average hotel	Stayed at this hotel on August Bank holiday, as I wanted to be near Buckingham Palace. The location was good, but I would not go back and stay in a hurry. When we checked in, the receptionist could not find our booking, after speaking with a colleague they eventually checked us in. The room was only set (we think for one person) due to the fact that the toiletries we had was for one shampoo, and one bath/shower. We did not eat dinner but was booked in for breakfast, and for the amount of money that was charged for the breakfast, I was very disappointed in the quality. However I would not have liked to be coming later for breakfast, as the queue was horrendous waiting for tables, as the restaurant is very small, there is a pub serving breakfast about 2 minutes from the hotel which I recommend (we had our dinner there), Overall for a four star hotel, I expected better. Just glad that it was not my hard earned money paying for it."
86,1040,Sep 25 2008 	Excellent Staff	We stayed in one of the Apartments at the Park Plaza and it was brilliant. Apart from a couple of marks on the sofa and chair (which were nothing to worry about) our stay was wonderful - the staff were lovely and the room totally soundproof. Well done Park Plaza!
87,1040,"Sep 4 2008 	Great!!	This hotel was great!! We arrived on time to get our room, but it was not ready. We went to the bar and had lunch, and seeing that the room was still not ready, the concierge upgraded us to a nicer room. As soon as we arrived in our room, the Guest Relations dept., ( Daniel and Peter) send us a bottle of champagne with fruit for our honeymoon! We had stayed at two other hotels before we arrived at this one, and we never got anything from the other hotels. Another concierge, Daniel, helped arranged for us to get on a bus to Heathrow. We had room service and although it was expensive, the food was great.My only complant about this hotel is that they could clean the rugs more often - they do not smell, but looked somewhat dirty (The Park Plaza Hotel in Amsterdam had the same problem, but their rugs actually gave off a bad odor).When we return to London, we will definitely stay at this hotel again!"
88,1040,"Sep 1 2008 	Good location problematic service	Wife stayed at property, Aug 29-Sept 2. Disappointed to have experienced the following: no voice mail in room, had to change rooms due to internet problems, staff was unresponsive to report of MOUSE in lobby bar (when she approached the staff member, the person shrugged her shoulders and said 'there is nothing we can do about it, we have our doors open, and they come in from outside&quot;), I called the property and the phone rang 20 times with no response, and a second time was left on hold for 3 minutes with no service. For the prices paid in London, better services are expected. The location is great, and for the most part the staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge was informative and very nice."
89,1040,"Sep 1 2008 	Needs to try harder	Stayed 4 nights, arriving Wednesday 27th August. Having read earlier reviews about reservation issues I phoned the hotel two days before just to check all in order as room booked via hotels reservation department over a month in advance. I had requested a walk in shower as friend has undergone hip replacenent and unable to climb over bath sides, I was assured all was in hand and exact room specified was available. On arrival, the room, a twin with a shower, with executive package was not available. Allocated a room on the 2nd floor, atrium view, which I was assured was a 'good quiet room'. On entering the room we were greated by an ironing board still up, dirty dishes, newspaper in the bathroom, beds made but dirty linen. I returned to the reception desk, a few internal calls, confirmed the room had been serviced and back checked, this clearly was not the case. I was then offered another room on the 6th floor, our executive package would have to follow and would be sent up. The bags were then transferred to our final room on the 6th floor, I would not really rate an 'executive', but it did have a view, was light, decoration getting a bit tired, glass vanity top had chunk of glass broken off, old style tv, carpet and decoration must be due for refurbishment. So we ended up in a room, not really what we wanted but forced to accept. The executive package arrived on a wooden tray after 10minutes, great service but this was a comb, sewing kit, two pairs of slippers, some better coffee, face clothes (which were never replaced during stay) and bathrobes (which had seen better days), not forgetting two apples and an orange, we never got the chocolates mentioned in the package!!It quickly became apparent paying extra for executive rooms does not mean you get any better rooms. The real and I would suggest the only benefit was access to the Executive lounge, this was used for breakfast and predinner drinks.The one member of staff who stood out over all others was the lady who served breakfasts mid week in the Executive lounge, very helpful, very polite, if only all the reception staff could rise to her standard, just how much better the hotel would be.The executive lounge did change at the wekend, with families staying, the quiet atmosphere lost, but still a great concept if standards maintained.Check out OK, errors quickly corrected, bags left for collection, when collected, no offer to get a taxi or enquire if assistance required. It was probably easier and quicker just to arrange yourself, but it would have been nice to be asked."
90,1040,"Aug 26 2008 	Really disappointed - much worse than last time.	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for two nights in August, having stayed at the hotel in 2003 on business and having very positive memories of it. Unfortunately this time around I was extremely disappointed.There were a number of things wrong with the hotel this time:- We arrived at 2pm but were told that our room wasn't ready yet and we were asked to wait 30 minutes. We went back 45 minutes later to be told that the room STILL wasn't ready and we had to wait a further 10 minutes to get our key.- The hotel clearly hasn't been refurbished since my last visit and the decor now looks dated and worn. Our room was very dark as we were on the third floor and the window simply looked straight out on to another building so there was no daylight whatsoever.- There was a connecting door between our room and next door which unfortunately meant that we could hear every word that the couple next door were saying to each other, even though they were speaking at a normal volume.- Our room wasn't serviced at all while we were there. We were out of the hotel from 10am to 3.30pm but when we came back to the room no-one had been in and we ended up having to call down to the housekeeper for extra toilet roll as we had run out.- Both mornings we had to queue for breakfast, even though we tried going earlier on the second day to avoid the queues.All in all the hotel is okay but I had very good memories of it from 2003 being quite luxurious and modern and it is definitely no longer like that. I wouldn't stay here again - there are other hotels in London for the same price that are much nicer."
91,1040,"Aug 20 2008 	Excellent	Stayed for 1 night at this hotel on 18th August and really couldn't fault it . Check in was fine - nice welcome room was ready for us and it was only 9.45 am and was upgraded to a suite which was great - large light room with great bathroom.Had booked an executive room so had all the little extras and use of the executive lounge which we used on getting there for coffees and later before we went out for drinks and nibbles.Excellent location - 2 mins from Victoria station and lots of eating places around.Breakfast was great and even suited my husband who is very fussy!Hotel is modern ,light and airy will definately return."
92,1040,"Aug 19 2008	Fantastic Staff!	We stayed here on two separate occasions (15th &amp; 19th August). The outstanding impression was of the staff. Every staff member that we met was friendly, cheerful, courteous, professional &amp; efficient. They really made our stay a very pleasant experience. I can honestly say that for a hotel of this grade, especially when you consider the location in a busy major city, I have never found a hotel where all of the staff excelled at their jobs to this extent. So often the staff in busy city hotels become jaded, but not here. They were of a standard that I would expect from a small exclusive hotel.The hotel in generally was perfectly as I would expect for a 4 star city hotel. The only negative comment I have is that the dining/breakfast room carpet is tatty &amp; very stained &amp; needs replacing urgently.The position is fantastic for Victoria station &amp; many of the nearby theatres. Highly recommended."
93,1040,"Aug 19 2008 	Good Location - double check your reservation!	I was aware that this hotel has reservation issues before I went (previous Trip Advisor reviews) so I was cautious to double check everything before I went, not only with Hotels.com site, but also with the hotel directly. We had 3 rooms, all on the executive level to include breakfast for 3 nights. We were changing hotels in London so I went to check in prior to having my luggage delivered just in case there were issues. Sure enough, there were. All the rooms were confirmed as standard rooms. Fortunately, I had brought names, dates and confirmation numbers (including hotels) plus I had an excellent front desk person (Peter). It was agreed that we did indeed book executive level rooms but when they are entered into their system, the indicators which show that it is &quot;executive&quot; are not being picked up by the Plaza people, nor any of the other extras. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RESERVATIONS!This is a nicely renovated Swedish hotel. Although the list of 'extras' you get with the upgrades room shows a bunch of things, we got almost nothing. Rooms were not cleaned each day, no new soap or shampoo the entire stay.There is a pillow variety option but they only had 1 foam pillow in the hotel which my Mom really needed. The housekeeping staff was short tempered when pressed as to why there were none available. We never received our newspaper and although it states that there are beverages available in the lounge area all the time, we were asked to leave outside the breakfast and evening starters times. This is a pricey hotel - and although it looks 4 star, it was very average. Location is great about 2 blocks from Victoria Station. They have a package which includes tickets to see &quot;Wicked&quot; next door - which we did and it was outstanding!Tip: Use their shuttle service to Heathrow. It was a bargain at 22 pounds, very nice and timely."
94,1040,"Aug 19 2008 	Just average	The location of the hotel is perfect if you're staying as tourist. It's close to Victoria station and major route of bus, even at walkable distance from Big Ben. But because of that, the hotel is a bit noisy. I'm not sure if that happened to me only.The hotel room is pretty much standard business class hotel room. The toiletries are simple, only soap, shampoo, body lotion. That's all. They even forgot to supply them for one two days, so I had to call to get the supplies. The TV is very outdated. The bed is standard. The breakfast is ok but has limited choice. Probably I'm too demanding but hey, for that kind of price, I think I deserved to ask for more.So, to be honest, if you're in business trip, just need good location to catch public transport and your company pay for it, it's pretty much good option. But if you're tourist. I guess you could find better hotel around Victoria with cheaper price."
95,1040,Aug 19 2008 	Excellent Stay Friendly Staff!!	We stayed at the Park Plaza Hotel for three nights at the end of our honeymoon. When we arrived the front desk staff was really friendly and courteous. It's location to Victoria Station was perfect for us. We did have the continental breakfast one morning and it was less than what I would have expected.Overall though I will stay at this hotel again when I travel back to London.Thanks
96,1040,"Aug 18 2008 	Will Definitely Stay Here Again	Just returned from spending 2 nights at the Park Plaza Victoria. The location is excellent. My wife and I are avid walkers when it comes to touring cities but London is a big city so having the option of using the &quot;Tube&quot; was fantastic with the Victoria Station just around the corner. We arrived at the the hotel around 11:00am and the reception was excellent. The lobby is contemporary and nicely designed. Stephane took care of us by starting with a pleasant greeting and smile. He was very professional and responsive to our inquiries including a late check-out request. The room was not quite ready (about an hours wait) but he quickly directed us to the concierge Marcin, for baggage storage.Upon returning we went to our room on the 4th floor and weren't disappointed. It was a good sized room, nice bathroom, king-size bed and very clean.The only concern was the mattress as the king was made up of 2 doubles put together and one was softer than the other. I'm sure if we had called the front desk they would have done somerhing about it but we chose not to.All and all a great stay and value. We celebrated our Anniversary and were sent complimentary champagne and strawberries, a nice touch. I had made a note when I registered online and they didn't forget. We will definitely stay at the Park Plaza the next time we travel to London. TipsVictoria Station for the tube is around the corner. A Day Pass is 5.30 pounds ea. You really only need Zone 1 &amp; 2 as it covers most of the main tourist hot spots. Day Pass is also good for the buses.You can walk to Buckingham Palace comfortably.If you are looking for a breakfast option other than the hotel there is a nice cafe called Caramel about 150yds south. Mon-Thurs the meal is 1/2 price."
97,1040,"Aug 16 2008 	Has changed over the last year or so....	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza during previous visits to London, and I was satisfied with the hotel, so that is why I decided to stay there again this June for a business trip.The hotel is conveniently located two blocks from the Victoria station, so commuting to and from my work location was easy enough. Also, the hotel staff could be considered helpful. However, during this stay I did not need any extra assistance, such as dry cleaning or concierge services, so I did not have many encounters with the staff other than checking in and checking out.One noticeable difference that I realized during this visit was that the carpeting in the hallways and room has become more and more stained over the last year and a half, and it seems that the hotel management has not done much to remediate the situation. Also, I noticed that the walls seem to be thin enough to hear the loud television from my neighbors room. I do not know why I did not notice the thin walls during my previous visits, but it may be because I just did not have people staying next door to me then. During this visit, I also tried out the hotel restaurant for breakfast. I was not exactly impressed by it, so I switched to picking up pastries and tea at Starbucks during most of my stay."
98,1040,"Aug 15 2008 	Fab Hotel Fab location Great price!	Fantastic Hotel in fab location - 2 minutes walk to Victoria Tube Station.Rooms were modern. clean and with good facilities.We booked directly on the internet and got a fab rate in an executive room with breakfast - cheaper than late rooms. Executive rooms give access to the executive lounge with free drinks, including alcoholic, and nibbles which our 10 year old thought was great!The staff were friendly and the breakfasts great as well.Absolutely couldn't fault it and will stay again when next in London"
99,1040,"Aug 14 2008	Bit disappointed	We stayed here after booking a deal online so got the rooms cheaper than booking direct. Even with the cheap deal I don't think the hotel was worth the money. The location is great but the hotel itself not so much. We were given two adjacent rooms on the first floor (which apparently has been redecorated). One of our rooms was so bad (cracked glass sink, architrave held on with masking tape in the bathroom, disgustingly mouldy tiles in the bathroom) that we complained and to be fair the staff were very helpful and not only moved us but upgraded the room as well. Ourrooms on the first floor on the corner opposite the bars were very noisy with loud music playing and people chatting (seemingly right outside our window) into the early hours. The air conditioning didn't work in our rooms either which made them quite stifling depsite not having the greatest weather (overcast and rainy but very close). All in all we were expecting a lot more from the rooms after seeing the impressive lobby area so were left a little disappointed."
100,1040,"Aug 11 2008 	Great Location	The location of this hotel was just perfect, within easy walking distance to Victoria Train Station and Buckingham Palace. My reservation was for a King sized bed but I was given a queen instead. The air conditioning was sufficient but very noisy. Overall, the staff are friendly and helpful; the conceirge desk staff were most accommodating. Upon check-out, I had some questions about my bill that did not make sense. The woman who emerged from the back office to aid the pleasant trainee desk clerk was not so nice and actually pulled the bill out of my hand after a lame explanation and threw it in the garbage. I told her I was not finished looking at it and still had questions; when she gave it back, I noticed it had someone else's name on it and was not my bill at all. A new bill was printed and the issue resolved but she was very unprofessional and impatient."
101,1040,"Aug 5 2008 	Nice hotel but not got what I paid for.	Don't get me wrong - the hotel is really nice. Great location (we went up to see &quot;Wicked The Musical&quot; hotel on a few hundred yards from theatre. Decor as you enter is great - very modern. Before our stay we requested a room on first floor as these have been redecorated. This request was noted and a suitable room allocated on arrival. Room was fine with modern decoration, a huge bath tub (shower over bath wasn't very powerful) and modern glass sink and new toilet. Bed was very comfortable. Room was nice size, no complaints. Now we come to our problem. We had paid for an executive room and believed we were given the correct room - nice and big. Upon reading what we got on the executive package we noticed a number of things missing from room. No fruit, water, buscuits, upgraded toiletries, slippers, robes or welcome tray. The only thing we recieved was a card to get in the executive lounge which wasn't the greatest. My wife went down to reception and asked about these items. The chap behind the desk, who I don't think understood english very well, told us the items hadn't been put in room yet (we did check in after their 2pm limit) and they would be. he confirmed what our room number was and we then returned to our room to get ready for our evening out fully expecting a knock on the door with our &quot;executive package&quot;. No knock came on the door. By this time we didn't have much time to get ready for dinner so we just went out and didn't talk to reception again. On returning to our room after the show we still had not recieved the missing items but too late and went to bed. Breakfast the next morning was fine with hot and cold buffet. Overall experience was totally let down by us not getting the full executive package that we had paid for. Maybe we should have complained again and again about what happened but we're typical british who put up with most things! I do expect for things to be sorted after complaining once - thinking about it now, i'm still not sure if the guy at reception really understood our problem and just left it.So overall, great hotel, moden decor, good location - but let down by not giving us what we paid for. Very dissapointing."
102,1040,"Aug 3 2008 	Fabulous!!	This was a last minute booking for a weekend trip to London and what a fabulous choice we made. The location was terrific; close to the theatre we'd booked and Victoria StationThe staff were friendly, helpful and courteous, the room superb and we were made to feel very comfortable throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble.Well done Park Plaza Victoria. We will definitely be staying with you again."
103,1040,"Jul 30 2008 	Nothing Exceptional	Nothing special to report. Just average perhaps more of a business hotel. Breakfast was probably the best thing about the hotel. Hot items (eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, etc.) as well as cold items (variety of fruits, cereals, yogurts, juices) and coffee round out the breakfast. Rooms were pretty average. Nothing really to complain about but nothing really amazing either. Bathrooms modern though nothing exceptional there either. Lobby area is nice. Went to the lobby/bar area one evening in order to have drinks from the bar however the waiter got the order wrong and had to wait for them to make the correct drink and it was undrinkable (poorly made). Concierge/front desk is well-staffed and somewhat helpful. Door area seemed well-attended to help with bags/cars. Close walking distance to Victoria Station, Theatre where &quot;Wicked&quot; is now playing, variety of shops, coffee shop, restaurant, pharmacy, grocery food store, and mailing/postage store within short walking distance."
104,1040,"Jul 28 2008	Hassle Free Stay	Stayed for the night. This hotel is in a good location, walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the River Thames. Hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Checkin and Checkout were hassle free. If you don't want to pay for the hotel breakfast which cost 16 per person then walk round the corner to the Weatherspoon Pub, where you can get a hearty one for a fraction of the cost at 3-4 including coffee.Victoria station is also round the corner which makes this an easy place to get to and from."
105,1040,"Jul 21 2008 	Pleased	Was very nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews , but was pleasantly suprised. We booked direct through hotel website for executive room with kingsize bed and extra child bed. We arrived at 13.30 and found the staff courteous and helpful, they had not put an extra bed in our room, but contacted housekeeping immediately and this was done within 10 mins while we used executive lounge.The room was a good size and clean and modern, everything worked, we had compilmentary goodies as descibed under package, only complaint was rock hard pillows but housekeeping would change these. We used executive lounge for coffee and breakfast. After a previous review we were nervous about using it for breakfast but was pleasantly suprised- the breakfast was buffet:croissants, muffins,rolls ,cereals,fruit etc.toast you did yourself. The counter stuff was cheese,salami,ham,smoked salmon, poached fish.Then there was hot items, sausage,bacon,grilled tomatoes, scrambled egg. The lounge was very quiet, not suprising really after what some reviewers had said.It wasn't top notch , but not bad either.Check out was easy and painless and staff were happy to store our backage until collection later in the day. Perhaps other travellers had higher expectations , we had none and were pleasantly suprised"
106,1040,"Jul 20 2008	still a great location getting a little threadbare	you can't ask for a better location and the price is very fair, but the rooms themselves are getting a little threadbare - worn linens especially."
107,1040,"Jul 17 2008 	Fantastic Location	My teenaged daughter and I stayed at the Park Plaza last week for 3 nights. It couldn't have been better. We arrived early and our room was ready, even though check-in was hours away. Staff very helpful and friendly. They provided an adaptor. The bathroom was lovely. Beds very comfortable. Full breakfast was great.Sainbury's is right around the corner - great grocery store with wonderful fresh wood oven baked pizza. Good restaurants nearby. Wicked and Billy Elliot down the street. Victoria Station an easy walk - it was so easy to travel around London on the tube! Can't wait to return!"
108,1040,"Jul 13 2008 	Great location!	We stayed at the property 3 total nights on two separate dates. Excellent location-- just across the street from Victoria Station. Make sure you ask for the right exit from Victoria-- of you will do a bit of walking (as we did the first time!). Good neighborhood with lots of little cafes and restaurants. If you like dim sum, check out Dim T just down the road by the grocery store. Property is a 15-20 minute walk to Big Ben, etc. Rooms are comfortable. Nothing fancy, but decent and modern. Bathrooms are big. Great decor in the lobby. Friendly and helpful staff."
109,1040,"Jul 12 2008 	A Better Hotel Could Not Be Found	After reading some of the previous reviews, I was a bit nervous about my upcoming trip to London and my stay at the Park Plaza Victoria. Upon arriving in London, however, we found the hotel to be nothing like some of the negative reviews we'd read. The staff was courteous and helpful, the room was clean and had a view overlooking London's skyline, and we were even met by a member of staff who gave us a bottle of champagne and some chocolates to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The food in the restaurant was a bit pricey, but very well done. This hotel is in central London and is within walking distance to virtually everything I wanted to see. Overall I was extremely satisfied with my stay... and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to properly see London.As for complaints about the unfriendly staff, I would comment that the staff were very professional and reserved. They were not chatty, hilarious, or obnoxious, but did their jobs efficiently and in a friendly manner. I did notice a few Americans who wanted to strike up a conversation with staff members who were overwhelmed with other customers and were clearly not interested in talking about all of the other hotels the customers had visited, or discuss previous trips the visitors had made. They simply wanted to do their job.As for the Airco, our room was a bit warm, but once the window was opened it cooled down to a comfortable temperature. What I found out after talking to another visitor to London was that most Londoners considered cold to be about 80 degrees, whereas we Americans seem to insist on meat-locker temperatures to remain comfortable.Again, I found nothing to complain about and enjoyed my trip very much"
110,1040,"Jul 10 2008 	a lovely surprise!	Haveing stayed in a number of london hotels that were disapointing, i wasnt expecting much from this one. What a surprise! We couldnt find any faults with this one, room perfect, staff perfect, everything A1. Only one fault is that it is hard to find as the address they give brings you to the back of it, which is on a main road and the hotel doesnt look the best from this side. but a pleasent surprise when you turn the corner. We will be back!"
111,1040,"Jul 10 2008	Never Again!	I had a very plesant stay at this hotel around Christmas 2004 and was really looking forward to returning because quality hotels in London are hard to find for around 120 quid at the weekends. However, after my stay in Fall '07 I will not return to this hotel again. I arrived early in the morning. The staff looked as though I had violated a cardinal rule by arrived before 3 pm. I explained that I had just come from Prague and was very tired. It was 10:30 in the morning and I asked that when someone checked out in the category of room that I reserved could they simply ask housekeeping to clean the room next because I arrived early. I would sit in the lobby until then. They looked as though I had asked them to stay for free in the apartment suites. After keeping me waiting in the lobby for 75 mintues (even though I was assured the room would be ready in about 20), I arrived to find a dirty, under furnished room. My television and mini-bar didn't work (I'd never stayed in a hotel where a minibar could be broken), and my phone refused to call out. After waiting for a long time for a technician to come they determined the could not fix the problems and upgraded me to a junior suite. (Problems solved, so I hoped). The noise in this room from its ajoining room was tremendous. My shower did not work properly and again the room was dirty. After I could take no more, I called down to the night manager. He offerred to move me to the apartment suite. I got to that room, which was indeed lovely, but it stank of tobacco smoke. I said that I had a medical condition and needed a non-smoking room. He said he could offer me nothing else. I then politely said that perhaps it was best that i simply pay for the charges on my room (room service, telephone, etc.) but that since they had failed to provide me either a properly working, smoke-free, or quiet room that we refund my room rate and that at 9:30 in the eveing I go out into the night looking for another hotel in London. (This with a 5am car scheduled in the morning). I have never been treated do disrespectfully be a hotel manager in my life. He said that because no one else complained he could not establish the validity of my claims. He finally did find an acceptable room after hours of misery. And I thankfully left the hotel as fast as I could but not before my driver who I have used in London for years was repeatedly barked at by hotel doorman in my presence for legally parking to avoid a ticket from a traffic warden. How unprofessional can you be? Never again."
112,1040,"Jul 2 2008 	Haven't Arrived as yet-But willing to cancel	I booked a room at this hotel for the period July 11-14th, 2008. On my confirmation document it states, &quot;Two Adults, one child...Two TWIN BEDS.&quot; As a result of the horrendous reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided to call first and confirm. Was grateful and horrified when I did. I was shuffled around to three staff members, the last of whom told me that I had booked only for &quot;Two Adults, there were two SINGLE BEDS in the room and that I would have to pay thirty pounds per night for the extra bed.&quot; The document in front of me sent by the hotel, stated otherwise. I would have gone to London and slept on the floor!!! What sort of Mickey Mouse operation is this (no insult to Walt Disney..since he runs an effecient place). It is ridiculous. I have not arrived...AND I DONT WANT TO GO!"
113,1040,"Jun 25 2008 	Lovely Relaxing Stay	Having stayed at the Park Plaza last weekend i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. The hotel is in an ideal location, our bedroom was nice and spacious, our dinner in JB's restaurant was fantastic and all the staff where helpfull and most importantly smiley. We will definitely return."
114,1040,"Jun 25 2008 	Pleasant stay at Park Plaza Victoria	2 night stay was pleasant and comfortable. Hotel location is convenient for subway, two theaters nearby and Buckingham Palace is a short walk away. Breakfast was well done.Despite the close proximity of Victoria station the hotel can be very difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area. The station area is very crowded for walking with luggage. Strangely, English was a second language for front desk personnel and bell staff; consequently, communication was not as easy as assumed. Room was not ready until 3 pm.On balance, I would gladly stay here again, but I would also consider alternative hotels before my next trip."
115,1040,"Jun 22 2008 	very nice hotel but( theres always a but)	Stayed here for one Saturday night start of June for a wedding anniversary treat, when the hotel found out it was a special occasion they upgraded us to a apartment which was v nice. However just a couple of points when we were packing up to leave my wife looked below our bed to check if we had missed anything but unfortunately it was the maid who had asa few used durex wrappers and empty wine botlles were still there from the last guests(the rest of the room was spotless). Another thing to take note of is the hotel hold a deposit in case you use the mini bar or room service which is fair enough however after you settled up this deposit is not immediately paid back into your account and it could be several days before this is done ( seemingly this is normal practice for a hotel). Hotel prices were what i expected for London 7.20 for a gin and tonic 5.40 for a VERY small glass of wine. I would however def stay here again and would recommend it to my friends."
116,1040,"Jun 20 2008 	Very poor customer service	Upon checkin, it was clearly obvious that there were plenty of staff members, however, most were just lollygagging around. Nobody smiled, nobody said hello, nobody acknowledged us. It was already off to a bad start.The room was your typical London room, however, the bathroom was nice. The room was very dated and obvious wear and tear was beyond belief.While the hotel is located in a great area, I cannot recommend staying here because of the lack of customer service."
117,1040,"Jun 20 2008 	Terrible Hotel and untrustworthy staff	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in June 2008 - never again! It was a terrible experience, with 2 expensive items being removed from my room. The manager was able to identify the 2 members of staff who entered the room, but claimed that they were trustworthy and so minimal effort was put into finding my stolen items. I was also informed by one staff member that 'it was only a stupid scarf'! Another member of staff informed me in confidence that rooms have been robbed regularly in recent months and the police have been involved on numerous occasions. Aside from this terribel incident, the service was atrocious and in fact the rooms were not cleaned daily and used wets towels were hung up rather than being replaced!"
118,1040,"Jun 17 2008 	Awful customer service!!!! 13th June-15th June 2008	My dad booked for myself and my mum to stay here for the weekend as a treat. We arrived at the hotel where the reception was packed. There were lots of staff behind the desk, yet only 3 were actually attending to guests. Nobody offered a smile or even a hello! The girl that dealt with us spoke very little English (which was quite frustrating). Eventually we got our key to our executive room. We opened the door and there was a tiny double room with the smallest bathroom I have ever seen! There were no bathrobes, no fruit, no water (which is in the exectuive package), no teabags or biscuits! I telephoned reception where it took talking to 3 different people before someone could help. I asked if this room was classed as an executive room, the girl answered yes. I said that we wanted to change rooms, so she said someone whould be up in 5 mins to take us to our new room and help us with our bags. 10 mins later, a young boy, who again spoke very little English knocked the door and said your key and walked off. He was so rude and didn't help with our suitcases. By this time myself and my mum were fed up of the hotel already! The new room was a bit bigger, no way was it an executive room. It was a standard double. The room was very worn and very shabby. The club lounge was big, the coffee machine was rubbish. There were no other refreshments out and the french wine and tiny quiches at 6pm-8pm were hardly canapes! It was a joke. I advise not bothering to go in there for breakfast, you don't get any special treatment. We had an awful experience here and it was not what we expected from a Park Plaza. The weekend was meant to be a stress free weekend, yet it upset my mum very much, annoyed me by lack of customer service and my dad felt awful that we had a terrible time at the hotel. Don't bother staying here, and if you do, don't pay for executive as you don't get anything more for the money! The customer service was terrible. A hello how are you?, a can I help was all that is needed!"
119,1040,"Jun 8 2008 	Don't Stay Here!	Me and friend decided to stay here after reading all the positive reviews.. What a mistake!When we arrived it was a very warm day, but not that hot. However me and my friend were very much looking forward to going to our &quot;air-conditioned&quot; room to cool down and get ready for an afternoon about town. check in was fine, but when we got to our room it was like a sauna, and I am not exaggerating! We turned the airconditioning onto full power (it was the warmest, slowest aircon in the world), after finding out the window didnt open, but this did not help at all. It felt like we had underfloor heating on, and the huge heated mirror in the bathroom was giving off lots and lots of heat! After reception had informed us that the air-con was working and that we couldnt change rooms we got out of the sauna as soon as possible.Upon our return we were dismayed to find out that although it had cooled down outside, it was still boiling in our room. (we had got a touristy thermometer from a souvenier shop, and that was registering 29-32 degrees!!) After two hot showers, as if you didnt have the hot water on the shower had no pressure we got ready for our night at the theatre and left.When we got back, still to the sauna, we decided that we would watch some TV, well that was a joke! the ancient huge TV had channel 5 that was working, and the volume would vanish and then come back at full volume! It was a joke, just like the rest of the hotel. So we filled the bath up with cold water to try and cool down. I called reception to find out were the ice machine was and was told that it was by the lift area on every floor. So of i went, and guess what... no ice machine. So i went to the floor below (level 8) and still no ice. I went back to the room, called reception and was assured that the ice machine was on every level. I assumed the heat had addled my brain so i went on the ice hunt again, no luck!! I decided to call rom service and ask for ice. They very rudely told us to get it ourselves and when I informed them I had been trying, they said the nearest ice machine to us was level 7 and that there is not an ice machine on every level.Overall the hotel was very very dated, not at all modern which is the image they try to convey. Everything was dated about the room, the aircon, the bedding, the carpet and the air con!Please save your money and stay somewhere else! Rude staff dated rooms and rooms that you want to spend no time in! I have stayed in many many London hotels and have never written a review before, but this hotel has annoyed me and ripped me off so much I thought i should warn fellow travellers."
120,1040,"Jun 1 2008 	thnk god it was just 1 night!	I hope by the time i have written this review i may have changed the mind of a weary traveller planning on staying here.....i arrived after check in time on a burning hot day in may for a birthday treat sight seeing in london and on arrival the receptionist ignored me for 10 minutes... after getting her attention with a cough she informed me that even though i booked online and had paid for the room in advanced she would need 100 as a deposit incase i 'damaged' the room or drank anything from the mini bar..i assured her that there was no chance of this happening and i wasnt parting with 100 as i had brought cash on my trip and not my credit cards... the manager was called and the fee brought down to 20..are they allowed to do this? i stuck to my guns and we checked in with the lesser deposit...all was well untill we arrived back late after a day tour of london..the room was at least 35+ degrees and the assured me the AC was working..it wasnt..and the windows did not open..my 15 year old daughter and i had to get dressed and walk the streets of victoria to cool down at midnight.... when we came back the room was even hotter and they would not come and check the AC.. we were so hot and weak we physically passed out on the bed in our clothes... we woke up literally to a suana..and decided that we wud check out at 6 am! it was that bad we washed in cold water, left our bags in the luggae room and went to macdonalds for breakfast..never again!! never again!there is nothing nice about this hotel... its old fashioned with a few new fixtures like a cheap flat screen that didnt pick up any channels..you could tell it was an old hotel by the plug sockets that looked pre war..i dont know who they are kiding about 4 star?? its not even on a par with a B&amp;B...do not stay here!!"
121,1040,"May 25 2008 	just okay	We arrived at the hotel just after 1200 and proceeded to cheak in which at first seemed a quick &amp; easy thing to do. Having informed the hotel at the time of booking that we would like early cheak in we discovered that our room an excutive room was not ready, could we leave our baggage and return within an hour or so, Daniel was the receptionist dealing with our booking, he did explain that they could not garantee early cheak in which was fine. We left our luggage and asked if we could have access to the excutive lounge to have coffee, Daniel handed over one pass key to the room. saying he had asked housekeeping to ensure our rooms whoild be available asap. having enjoyed a couple of coffees, we left to have a stroll around the city, and a bite of lunch. We returned to the hotel at 1500 almost 3 hours after cheaking in to discover that our room was not ready still and Daniel seemed to have lost all the paperwork perpared upon our cheak in, Looking flustered he asked us to go to the bar and have a drink on them whilst he sorted the mater. We enjoyed a beer and a moderate glass of wine whilst waiting for someone to tell us what was going on. At last about 30 minutes later I spoke to a female receptionist asking her what was happening as we would like our room, as we did have an early evening appointment and would like to freshen up. After a flustered few minutes and a phone call she told us our room was ready. having been at the check in whist others checked into excutive rooms the benifits of the lounge was explained, we had no details given to us and if we had not recieved the swipe card from Daniel at 1200 would not even have been offered the access to the facilty we paid for ........ The waitress in the bar asked for me to sign for the drinks as they had not been told there were to be on the house. this was soon sorted. Our room was clean and tidy although a lot smaller than others we have stayed in. The mini bar had a mind of it's own and would not open so they had no sales there, and the tv altough had sky, access was denied to movies which is a normal bonus for excutive rooms.The breakfast which was included was very good although on day two a male waiter seemed not to want to serve us with any coffee and avoided us with the pot on more than one occasion. His female colleage did however offer us some in the end.During our stay we did suffer the dreaded Firealarm although this was late afternoon as we we getting ready for a evening out at Gordon Rasmeys Foxtrot Oscars.I found that during this we evactuated to the area where posters said to go, all staff seemed to wait by the pub before the all clear was given, however No one told residents it was clear we followed staff back into the hotel.Overall the location of the hotel is it's biggest plus very close to Victoria station and access to entire london.the room was okay although i thought on the small size. staff were pleasent but I did find them lacking in the final touches of customer services.Value for money well I have to say NO over 400 for two nights. I have had better value stays In London. as we checked out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay, the lad seemed putback when we said it was just okay, and even more surprised when we answered &quot;i doubt it &quot; to the question would you stay with us again. It is a pity they dont offer the same 100% garantee satifaction as their sister chain Radisson, I May have invoked it this time if they did."
122,1040,"May 20 2008 	Good central hotel	Got a very good deal booking this hotel direct a few months back, much cheaper than the so called cheap hotel sites.Anyway, this hotel is a modern , central hotel 10 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, 30ish to Picadilly.Room was a decent size, clean &amp; bathroom good with a nice bath &amp; shower.Hotel has limited health club, small sauna &amp; jacuzzi. Bar prices as you would expect from a 4 star central hotel in London.I would stay here again if the price was right."
123,1040,"May 12 2008 	Nice hotel but be careful when booking!	We booked this hotel through Orbitz with the understanding that breakfast was included in the price. I spoke with a representative at Orbitz to make certain that this was so, and after he had checked with someone there, he told me that breakfast was certainly included. Six days later when we actually arrived in London, we were more than a little disappointed to discover that this was NOT SO, and the hotel staff was very forceful in stating that we had not paid enough to rate breakfast included! (We thought we had paid quite a lot.)(At the time of our booking there was only one type of room available, so it was not at all clear to me at the time of booking, as it might be today, that there is a difference between &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;executive&quot; rooms, and I simply accepted that we had a relatively good rate, and the word &quot;breakfast&quot; was in bold in Orbitz's list of amenities, which it usually is not if that is not offered with the package.) Neither Orbitz nor the hotel would budge an inch on helping us out in this matter when we were checking in. (The hotel did help us call Orbitz, but the representative that I spoke with could find no record that I had made the booking by phone or who had helped me a week earlier.) As breakfasts at this hotel start at about 13 pounds for continental, we simply enjoyed the fact that there is a Sainsbury's a short block away and got nice breakfast food there much cheaper. However, this certainly marred our experience and made us feel that we were always running around from shop to shop. It also changed our perceived value of the hotel quite a lot! The hotel also seemed to be stingy with its teabags and little things like that. No little biscuits...just a room, maid service, a few tea bags, 4 little milks and sugar packets, and skimpy soaps. They did give us a fan when it got too hot. A/C was not on yet and it was quite hot in London the week we were there.On the very positive side, it is a lovely modern hotel with a beautiful workout room and sauna. The lobby is quite comfortable with free newspapers available. The concierge was always very helpful, and the place is in a great location with easy access."
124,1040,"May 10 2008 	Nice modern hotel in the heart of London	We booked this hotel from lastminute.com and it was the &quot;mystery hotel&quot; and we were well impressed with what we got. The hotel was fresh and modern and our room was spacious and well decorated. The bathroom was lovely and clean and the shower pressure was fantastic.I have seen some of the other reviews which stated that the hotel was expensive but we found it to be well priced for its location and the room size. For the same price, we could have been staying at a London B &amp; B which would have involved probably many stairs and a much smaller room and bathroom.The central location is fantastic for accessing all parts of London and we chose to catch the bus most places so we could see as we went.I am a travel agent and even though we don't sell this property, I have been recommending it to my clients as a great place to stay."
125,1040,"Apr 29 2008 	We made a confirmed booking but they said the hotel was full 	I booked 4 rooms at this hotel. A few days before arrival, I phoned up to confirm my booking (including the fact that we were all men, so needed Twin rooms).When we arrived, the staff unashamedly informed us that they had over-booked the hotel, so our rooms would not be available. This clearly is not acceptable. However, not only did they say we couldn't have our twin rooms, they said they didn't have ANY rooms for us at all - so we would have to stay elsewhere.After waiting 30mins, they said they might be able to get us into a room at a sister hotel in Westminster - but couldn't guarantee this. For a few minutes, we thought we would be sleeping rough!When we asked to see the manager, she kept telling us &quot;What you fail to understand sir, is that this hotel is fully booked&quot;. Considering that I had my booking sheet in front of me, with reference number etc, you can understand how angry we were. Especially as we had tickets for a show, which was due to start in 30mins.How can a hotel over-book rooms and tell guests to go away? Especially when I had phoned up to confirm a few days earlier. This was the first time I have experienced such an outrage, at any hotel in the world. So my advice to everyone is this. Do not stay at this hotel, because you might arrive after a long flight only to be told that they have no room for you! Quiet simply it is pathetic, &amp; dishonest. How do they sleep at night?!The attitude of the staff was obnoxious, unsympathetic &amp; amateurish. However, after about 45mins of angry discussions, they finally changed their minds and said we could have double rooms - obviously not ideal, but better than sleeping on the streets. However, the fact they actually found soom rooms at all proves they were lying to us earlier. Incredible. On our suggestion, they put a temporary / camper bed in the rooms, so that we didn't have to sleep together. However, this was our idea ... the staff didn't have the imagination to think of this solution themselves.Oh .. and by the way ... we missed the first 20mins of our show. Not that the staff cared one little bit.Avoid this place like the plague. Never have I experienced such shoddy service. At this place, bookings count for nothing. Imagine if all hotels did exactly the same?! They didn't even apologise."
126,1040,"Apr 21 2008 	Great location 	Great location for exploring London!Exit Victoria tube station onto Wilton Road &amp; hotel is 3 min walk to the right. Despite an unusual entrance the modern, open-plan &amp; airy foyer / bar / restaraunt is impressive &amp; spotless. Staff were plentiful &amp; helpful; although our room wasn't ready upon check in there was no problem leaving luggage.We got a great deal on 2 double rooms through a specialist London website &amp; the price including full breakfast was incredible value for money. Rooms were more than ample in size with fresh linen &amp; a bright, clean bathroom. For those concerned on the flat pillow issue there are spares in the ample wardrobe, along with a very handy iron &amp; full sized board.Based on other reviews we avoided even opening the mini-bar rather than risk auto-charging, although we were not warned this could happen when we checked in.Drinks in the hotel are expensive, 6.80 for a gin minus any tonic!Would most definately stay here again or recommend to anyone!With regards to sight-seeing I would agree with previous reviewer that Madame Tussaud's 'Chamber Live' is a complete RIP-OFF, mind you unless the weather is awful there's not much value for money in the whole MT's experience!Head to St. Paul's around 4.30pm for bell-ringing &amp; choral practice. Not normally my cup of tea but fantastic atmosphere in stunning surroundings turned out to be the highlight of this trip!"
127,1040,"Mar 30 2008 	Excellent location	We stayed in this hotel in March. Location was great. We flew into Gatwick airport and got the gatwick express which was quite expensive to vistoria station, about 30 return, considering its a half hour journey not great value but it goes every 15 mins so was convenient. We then arrived at victoria station and exited beside Mc Donalds in the station and were delighted to see the apollo theatre with the hotel being a 2 min walk from there. Great when you are carrying luggage or kids. We arrived at about 11am (check-in is at 2) and were given a room straight away. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was fine, decent size, like I read in another review pillows very flat you need to fold them over to get any height. Air conditioning was fine too. Just the right temp. Bathroom was quite nice, big mirror and nice sink. Not the most luxurious hotel but its in a great location for setting off from. We had a continental breakfast each morning which was ok. There was lots of fruit ( nothing exciting- apples, grapefruit, oranges, melon) chopped up in bowls, danish pastries and croissants, cereal and juices (tomato, apple, orange). On the day we checked out our flight was not until 6, the staff were very helpful and kept our luggage at the concierge desk so we could go and see more of the city and then get our bags when we were leaving for the airport. A final tip, we did a lot of our sight seeing on a tour bus, it was great to see the city and you can get off when you see something you would like to explore more. We went with the Big bus Co. You can also buy your tickets for attractions (like madame tussauds, london dungeons, london eye) with these people at big discounts. Usually 50% of the price you would pay at the door. If you go to madame tussauds, dont bother doing the live chamber of horrors. Its 3 and is essentially a dark room where actors jump out at you. Big waste of money. London dungeon is well worth a visit.To summarise the accommodation was fine, expensive for what you actually get though. Its clean and staff were helpful and is in a great location so I will be staying again."
128,1040,"Mar 29 2008 	Perfect Central location	Keeping this brief,,Lovely central location, minutes from Victoria station. We arrived early and were able to check in immediately. We booked the executive package with breakast and were really pleased to have done so, the executive lounge is a really nice relaxing area with a really good breakfast choice and litttle tapas style snacks in the evening with wine, beer or coffee available. Lovely clean room with added touches of a welcome basket with fruit and water. Close to restaurants and a supermarket. I would definatley stay here again, thank you very much Vicoria Park Plaza, we had a superb weekend."
129,1040,"Mar 8 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location	This is our second stay in 2 years at this hotel and we have never been disappointed. The rooms are of good size and modern decor.The staff are always friendly and polite and the buffet breakfast has plenty of choice.Great location just, a few minutes away from the train and tube station. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great base to discover London."
130,1040,"Mar 1 2008 	A good hotel in agreat location	I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights while attending a conference. The staff were very helpful and always happy to help. My room was very clean, nicely furnished and the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast was fine but with not as much choice as many hotels I have stayed at in London.I ordered breakfast in my room on the second day but it had not turned up by the time I had to leave even after being assured it was on the way. I later complained to the guest relations manager who was very apologetic and deducted the cost of the breakfast from my bill. Thirty minutes later a huge platter of fruit and two bottles of water were delivered to my room with compliments of the management. I thought it was a nice gesture and made me feel as if I had been really listened to.The hotel is in the middle of everything with loads of shops and restaurants on the door step and next door to Victoria staion and underground. Buckingham Palace is just a short stroll away.I would definately stay at this hotel again."
131,1040,"Feb 25 2008 	Worn around the edges but decent hotel	I had no expectations about this hotel upon walking in, apart from reading a few reviews on tripadvisor.com. First impression was that it was amazingly hip and stylish for a hotel in that area. But I soon noticed that the hotel was really stuck in the past and was quite worn around the edges. The lobby and cheesy artwork seemed stuck in the early 90's -- with hold-over 80's neon-damage. The room was decently proportioned and furnished, but the carpet was well-worn. The bed was a bit saggy, but had nice linens. Ceiling lights in the room were oddly differently colored, with old and new lightbulbs intermixed. The bathroom was functional, with the added bonus of heated fog-free mirrors.The minibar was typical for a London hotel with a fairly limited -- and expensive -- selection. Pay-per-view was antiquated as well with a limited set of movies on rotation. The air conditioning/heater worked well and an added bonus was a window that opened for fresh air.WiFi in the room was very expensive, but not out of the ordinary for London hotels. I didn't try room service, but did have dinner in the hotel bar, which was tasty (alas the restaurant was booked up due to it being Valentine's Day). The big bar was comfortable and had a good selection. One bonus (at least in my mind) -- I got to see the hotel mouse referenced in other reviews. It was so cute, I had to drop a few peanuts on the floor for it, while making a mental note to request an upper floor on my next visit!I can't comment on the breakfast, since the Saturday morning line was too long to get in to the restaurant.I've heard stories from colleagues about hot water problems and other issues with the hotel, but with our corporate discount it was a great value for the money. Until something goes seriously wrong, I'll be back!"
132,1040,"Feb 24 2008 	Good and Bad Experience	My friend and I (40 &amp; 51 year old females) stayed at the Park Plaza Victoria as part of a coach tour weekend break to see Grease. We were unfortunate to have a terrible journey to London (10 hours journey from S Yorks) due to a variety of things which of course are not the hotels fault, however upon arrival you can imagine we were both very stressed and tired. First impressions of the hotel were very good, and we were issued with a twin room as requested which was very clean and well presented. The only draw back was that it overlooked a large building project and you felt that you we able to shake the hand if the builders on site it was that close and the curtains to the room didn't close totally! Also the air con blew out warm air and as the windows have restrictors on them, ventilation was awful.After our visit to the theatre we returned back to the hotel at approx 11:20pm and we decided to retire straight to our room for what we hoped was a good nights sleep. At approx 11:50pm, we were sat in our beds looking at the map of London and trying to plan the following days events when we had a knock on our bedroom door. Being two females alone we were obviously very concerned and decided to ignore it. A few minutes later we had another louder knock on the door and I decided to have a look through the spy hole. Outside stood 2 men and I called through the door what do you want. They said &quot;Security, open the door!&quot; As you can imagine we were so scared and refused to open the door. My friend phoned down to reception and told them what had happened. She was told that we had been reported for being too loud and hence security had been called. We explained that we were sat quietly in bed and not making any noise! The whole situation was totally unacceptable. Why didn't the hotel reception ring through to the room if they felt there was an issue, rather then send two security guards to a room with 2 female occupants. Following the incident neither of us were able to sleep and at 4:30am my friend suffered a severe migraine and was physically sick. We eventually went down for breakfast at 7am which was excellent with plenty of choice. One other thing to watch out for is the mini bar in the room - don't remove anything from it or move items around as it is computerised and automatically charges your room. I made the mistake of moving a Mars Bar and got a 1.50 charge, however when I explained this was cancelled. It is such a shame that we had a bad experience at this hotel, as some aspects were good, but I do feel that I need to make other travellers aware of this, especially if they are females travelling alone."
133,1040,"Feb 24 2008 	Good location not very good service...	The location is great, right near Victoria. You will get a reliable breakfast here and it is one of the better breakfasts we've come across. However, the service here has been terrible on several occasions. Of the 4 times we have stayed there we have always had a problem either checking in or with our bill. We've booked through a corporate rate and this should be very simple - it never is.One morning upon requesting an iron - it came 1 hour and 45 minutes later. Another time housekeeping informed us they were &quot;out of irons&quot;. Not very typical of a business hotel.For what you pay for here, this really is not worth it."
134,1040,"Feb 21 2008	Super Hotel	Had a super Valentine weekend in London. We were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Park Plaza which is just across the road from Victoria Station. We had a super welcome by lovely reception staff and were able to take our room straight away at 10.30 am which was a bonus. Couldn't fault it. Will stay there every time we go to London. For anyone who likes Indian food there is a small Indian Restaurant on a corner opposite the breakfast room, called &quot;Spicy World&quot;. Super Indian food and take your own wine ! Excellent."
135,1040,"Feb 18 2008 	Second stay at the VPP not dissapointed	This was our second stay at the VPP and we were not dissapointed. Like others writing here we arrived after a weary 20 hour journey quite early before check in in time. We were able to check in after a few hours wait but well before the standard check in time. We stayed on the 4th floor a couple of doors down from the lift and and no trouble with noise. The temperature was fine not too hot as others here have stated. The service was good at the restaurant where the continental breakfast was quite adequate. The rooms were clean and well maintained. We did not try to for a King bed and the Queen sixed bed was fine. Rooms were of reasonable size.As with others here, the location was caused us to return. Proximity to Victoria Station and the tube really is a plus. We went around the corner to see Billy Eliot which is hightly recommended. Internet access had a weekly rate this stay that was steep but not unreasonable and we did not have to go to the Starbucks around the corner to access (internet was down there anyways). There was an Italian restaurant just down the street that was quite good as was the Willow Walk Pub.We enjoyed the Golden Tours Bus tour to Windsor and Bath as well as the day trip to Paris during our stay.Would stay at the VPP again. If you use face towels don't forget to bring your own, they were not supplied. Also they were very stingy about soap.Regards S"
136,1040,"Feb 14 2008 	Loved the location!	Gota very good rate from this hotel and we were not disappointed! Great location and lovely big room! Well worth the price, staff were also very nice and the hotel had a huge bar area would definitely go again!"
137,1040,"Feb 11 2008 	Poor customer service	It appears that the old maxim that &quot;the customer is always right &quot; has no meaning for this hotel. Having suffered disappointments there before with my reservations, I gave the hotel another chance and will not be doing so again.I made my reservation in early January for a non smoking room with a king size bed. The reservation was duly confirmed. On arrival at the hotel 5 weeks later, I was checked into a room with a queen sized bed. Just for the record, on a previous stay I was given a smoking room, having booked a non smoking room. I then went down to reception to try and change the room and was given a dose of utter bs by the girl there who, despite my holding a piece of paper with my confirmed reservation, tried to argue that all these reservations are subject to availability. We were then asked to wait for up to 1.25 hours in the lobby for a room to become available. We had arrived at the hotel well after check in time by the way, so the fact was that they had simply ignored my reservation and were trying to palm me off with something I had not ordered. After about 20 minutes, we were shown to a room with a king size bed. The room was dirty and I have the distinct view that the management of this hotel are just letting it deteriorate. IMHO it falls short of 4* accomodation.Day 2 we left the room at 0700 and I looked for a &quot;please make up my room&quot; sign to hang on the door. There wasn't one and the hotel appear not to use them. The result was that on arriving back to the hotel at 1530 that afternoon, tired and in need of some privacy, I coincided with the maid just going into the room to clean it. This despite the fact that they were already on the floor when I left in the morning. I complained and, unbelievably, the same thing happened the next day.My wife then called the front desk to complain, was put onto someone in management who was totally unsympathetic and immediately went on the attack offering no apologyOn checking out I was asked if I had enjoyed my stay, and I related these experiences. The employee at checkout then requested that I speak to the assistant manager. I did not really want to as we were in a hurry, but I agreed to as I thought it might be helpful if he knew of the bad experiences of his guests.Some officious youngster then approached us, I explained my disattisfaction and he then immediately said that my complaints were small things and if I was that fussy I should stay at a 5 star hotel. Now, I have spent the majority of my life travelling and staying in a whole range of hotels and know that the issues I was complaining about are not normally experienced in a 4 star hotel. Still, he obviously had his view and as far as I could see, his attitude was part of the problem not the solution. All I needed was an apology, a realisation that I had been frustrated and an offer to look into these annoyances. I would probably have stayed there again. No such luck. This guy is too young, arrogant and inexperienced for a position which puts him in front of customers. The top management of this hotel need to take a close look at how they manage their customer relations. If I treated my customers like that, I would have no business left.The young man seemed oblivious tro the fact that a large majority of the complaints on this establishment relate to staff indifference.Don't stay there and, by the way, I don't think the ac in the room worked once during our stay."
138,1040,"Jan 25 2008 	Trendy hotel in a good location	We stayed there on a business trip and although our favorite in London is the Mandarin we tried this being on a bit tighter budget. We were not disappointed. Rooms are a good size and modern, all what you need is there. The bar had a good selection of drinks especially whiskeys so we tried several and the nice waiter told us about the special characteristics of the whiskey. Location is really good as has been said before."
139,1040,"Jan 16 2008 	Not bad	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights just before Christmas. Park Plaza Victoria is situated in an awesome location. it is 2 mins from the Victoria station. if you arrived from the airport, just take the express train to Victoria, walk out the exit that is closest to the McDonald's and you will see the hotel after a 2-min walk. My husband and I really liked the hotel, we thought that we would have a good nite sleep. The room was quite big, really nice bathroom. I must say the ventilation in the room was not what i expected. it was extremely dry, not like we cranked up the heat but we had to constantly drink water to keep ourselves from drying up. I really liked the room until i woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. There was a big cockroach on the bathroom mirror. it was BIG! After i saw that, i couldn't sleep for the rest of the night.We came back to this hotel for the second time in Jan 2008, right before we flew back to Vancouver. This time, they gave us a bigger room and also complimentary continental breakfast. Don't expect too much from the breakfast. you are eating in London. wifi is available at a very high price compare to the rest of the hotels that we stayed in. other than that, i liked this hotel. i would come back to this hotel because it is super convenient."
140,1040,Jan 4 2008 	no such thing as a free lunch	Came back to this hotel as they wished to apologise for our last stay.offered us either a free lunchor dinner -we accepted.On arrival the electricity was out -not their error so that was ok. Unable to check us in till later due to fault again not their fault we went out shopping.On return they advised us taht they could not offer us the dinner in the restaurant as this was closed until Jan. this was their error. Asked why no one had told us about it -no response! Offered us dinner in the bar - we accepted.Dinner atthe bar -awful took 10 mins to get served and 45 mins for our starter to arrive (SALADS!!!). Complained and we were infromed that we had complained too much. No resolution and we eat outside the hotel.Do not stay here the holtel looks nice but they really have no customer service.
141,1040,Jan 2 2008 	Outstanding Service and Hotel	We chose this hotel because of it's proximity to Victoria Station. We were able to take the train from Gatwick to Victoria and walk 1/2 block to the Hotel.  The staff was just perfect. On Christmas day we were going on a tour for the whole day and nothing was open for breakfast. The front desk gave us a box breakfast that belonged to some tour group. The rest of the staff could not do enough for us. The rate was under $175 per day and the room and bath were excellent in size and cleanliness. There are excellent Turkish and Indian restaurants within a block of the hotel A great 5 day vacation in London. Caution: All public transportation is CLOSED on Christmas so only a few tours are available.
142,1040,"Jan 2 2008 	Great location shame about.....	New Years Eve, stayed one night. Great location right in the centre of Victoria, London. Hotel contemporary appearance inside, staff very friendly. However, it was sad to see such a lack of attention to detail. Firstly, we had booked an executive room with lounge access with included breakfast. On arrival were told the lounge was closed and breakfast would be in the main restaurant. We were given drink vouchers for a 2 hr period in the evening. Our Restaurant booking was supposed to be at 9pm but they had booked us in at 6pm. In the morning we went to the main resaurant for breakfast only to be told to go the Executive lounge which was now open. We went there but couldn't get in because we didn't have the correct access card. Rooms were a reasonable size but it was too warm in there and the air conditioning unable to seemingly cope. Room very clean, nice bathroom. Come on Park Plaza, there are alot of good hotels in London, you really should not be so sloppy!"
143,1040,"Dec 28 2007 	Clean safe and friendly	This was my second stay at this hotel. Last time I stayed with my husband, and this time I was on my own. Stayed for one night only, but time permitting would have stayed longer. Made two theatre trips (bus ride of 6mins to Trafalgar Sq). Room and bathroom nice and clean. Also felt safe. Staff friendly enough and also efficient. Very handy for train to Gatwick for journey home. Have joined their loyalty programme as I'll be using the hotel again."
144,1040,"Dec 24 2007 	I Won't be back	I wish I had more positive things to say about the Victoria Park Plaza, but I am finding it hard to come up with more positives than negatives.Lets start with reservations. I requested a room away from the lifts with a view. I am a light sleeper, I don't want to hear people discussing their day on the way to their rooms. Neither of these requests were fulfilled. In fact the first room I was allocated was literally backing onto the lift shaft. Not a good start at all.Location is good, as it is near to Victoria tube/bus/rail station, and handy for the two theatresReception. We arrived a little early for check in - around 130pm. We were met by what only can be described as chaos in the reception. a bus tour had arrived (they use this hotel a lot for bus tours). We waited 30 mins to check in. Understandably we weren't allowed in our hotel room, so we left our bags with the concierge. We came back at around 245pm, yet another queue another 20 mins wait to find out that our room wasn't ready. We weren't the only ones being told this, and people were a little understandably irrate. The reason given for not being able to have the room was that people had had it for a late check out. Not a good start, but we did some shopping and came back at 415pm. Still a queue of people trying to get into their rooms another 15 minutes wait. We had wasted almost an hour trying to get into our room. We asked the concierge if he would bring our bags to our rooms &quot;we've got 200 bags in here, you have got no chance&quot;. Absolute appalling service.Then we got to our room, but it was backing onto the lift shaft, the room itself was very hot (floor 7) despite me turning the &quot;air con&quot; down. This is not at all what I had requested, and had rang the hotel twice befor my visit to ensure they could meet my request. So my husband asks to change the room. No way, we are full. You will need to ring back after 7. All we wanted to do was to put our clothes into the wardrobe. So my husband rang back to try and get us a room away from the lifts and asked to speak to the manager. He admitted that there were some &quot;late check in rooms&quot; and perhaps we could wait until 7 until one of them was deemed free. My husband asked why the late check in room couldn't be swapped for our room. 15 mins later we were moved to room 437. Away from the lifts and with some comfort cooling (it isn't aircon, as it wasn't icy cool air coming out of the vent). It was now 515pm.We had paid extra for an executive package. This isn't a larger room, just bathrobes, slippers, flannel, comb, toothbrush and a golden delicious apple, a mandarin and a banana. It also gives you access to an &quot;executive&quot; lounge, which has tea/coffee, (cold water machine out of order), danish pastries, and in the evening wine and nibbles for 1 hour. I wouldn't say it was worth the money, much easier to go to the local pubs.The room itself is an average sized london room. 1 chair (in a room meant for 2), furnishings not unlike a holiday inn (lightwood furniture). In room 437 there is a stainless steel basin, not unlike a prison issue sink. The glass basin has obviously broken and been replaced with inferior fittings. The bed was comfortable, but no bed protectors over the matress, and stained mattress underneath. The pillows are thin and lifeless.As we had stayed at VPP before we knew that breakfast just tends to be one long queue at weekends (not unlike the reception), so we had breakfast in our room, which was well worth the 6 supplement , the food was hot and plentiful. I must say that in the last 5 years the VPP has gone downhill from a place where I used to want to stay to one I won't stay at again.I wrote to the manager about my stay, but 4 weeks after my stay, I still haven't had a letter of apology. I think this sums up the attitude of the hotel. There are other much better hotels for the money in Victoria, I personally will be looking at other places to stay in the future."
145,1040,"Dec 24 2007 	terrible!	Having stayed here on business I booked two non smoking rooms directly with the hotel expressing at the time we were strict about having non smoking rooms.Arriving to find we were allocated smoking rooms and to be told the hotel was full and we could not move ensured we had a smelly room for the night. We also had to put up with people wandering floor one smoking (which I thought is now against the law?) The staff were ok but stated &quot;oh we have a lot of Air France crew who ingnore the UK laws and smoke freely&quot;!!not good enough, I ask for a part refund which was refused so...I won't stay there again which means another hotel will get my company business."
146,1040,"Dec 21 2007 	loved it	stayed here for a weekend 7-9 of december, was a bit worried about the heating as i had my mother and my 8 year old daughter with me,but it was ok the room was warm so i asked for a fan but only had to use it on the first night, as for everything else in the hotel we loved it, spacious rooms and lobby area great location, and the staff were great we will definatly be going back next year,"
147,1040,"Dec 16 2007	o.k but there are better places for your money	Stayed for 2 nights in December 07 just for a chilling out weekend. If your looking for a hotel which is near Victoria bus/coach station well this is ideally situated, also only 10 minutes stroll to Buckingham Palace and a short taxi ride to Harrods. Also the Apollo theatre is a 2 minute walk away where at the moment ' Billy Elliot ' is on, really worth seeing. I paid 280 which i thought was average for a London hotel but my room looked onto a building site literally. The hotel is classed as a 4 star but i only found it to be average,its clean enough but nothing special and i would pay more money next time to stay somewhere a bit better. Would i go back to this hotel? No not really,enjoyed the location but i will stop somewhere else next time"
148,1040,"Dec 11 2007 	Great location	Great location. Just a couple of hundred yards from the Victoria rail and tube station. That really made a big difference considering that it rained every day that I was there. The proximity of the tube station meant that I did not have to get soaked in the rain.Very lively area, including pubs, shopping, theaters.Another reviewer commented that the room was hot. I would have to agree with that. It was cool outside - in th 40s at night (Farenheit) but even then, I would have to turn down the thermostat, and I still woke up with a sweat every morning. Either the thermostats are faulty or the hotel has inadequate air conditioning capacity.Internet connectivity was not well designed. There's a different charge for a wireless connection, vs. a wired conection. the two services can't figure out that you are connecting from the same room, so you get billed separately. The wired connection gets billed to your room, and the wireless connection you have to pay with your credit card. That's not very intelligent."
149,1040,"Dec 5 2007 	Interesting Experience ...	We stayed at the Park Plaza the nights of November 24 through November 26. We decided to splurge a bit and got the Executive upgrade. It was interesting What We LikedPerfect location. Less than 5 minutes from Victoria StationRoom size  larger than we expectedComfortable bedLots of hot water in the morning.What We Didnt LikeHair dryer was in the closet in the hallwayThe hotel was REALLY hot each night. After two inquiries, and being told that someone would take care of it, by the third request we finally found out that the A/C had been turned off, so there was no other way to cool the room even a bit was to open the window. Good location, but noisy location. Just left the window open as long as we could each night.Some staff seemed disinterested and didnt know the answer to simple questions about the hotel or the areaWeird bathroom layoutSheets not changed two days in a row. We had spilled a bit of cola on the sheet the first night we were there, in an area normally covered by the duvet. As the bed was always made when we returned, we had no reason to believe the sheets were not changed. But upon packing to leave the morning of our departure, and pulling back the duvet to make sure we had everything, we discovered the original spot. When we mentioned it upon checkout, the clerk didnt seem to think it was a big deal.Our ImpressionsTheres a lot of interesting design in the hotel. The room was large and well furnished. But it just seems like much of the design is not really functional. The pillows on our bed looked great with the bedding, but they were not comfortable to sleep on. Minor irritation.Well check out another hotel in the area the next time were in London. This is a beautiful hotel, but just not to our taste."
150,1040,Nov 28 2007 	loved the hotel and staff	Loved the hotel. Close to train station. Spacious rooms which were very clean. Staff were a delight but maybe a little nudge to breakfast restaurant staff who were not quite so friendly. Maybe it was a bit early for them!!!!!Got in touch with hotel direct as it was a special occasion and they could not have been more friendly. Luke- Jozef the guest relations manager was superb and made our stay very memorable.Will definitely use again and would definitely recommend
151,1040,"Nov 24 2007 	Great hotel near Victoria	We stayed only 1 night in mid-november shopping weekend in London and we loved the Park Plaza Victoria. It was our 1st time in this hotel and booked through their website a Dble King-Deluxe roomUpon check-in, we were told that King-Dble are sold out but we finallyreceived an Apartment for free upgrade! It was a nice touch they gave us as the apartment is almost twice the size of a dble-room I can guess (see pics), and very comfortable.Room was great, large, clean, not too warm, with a nice marble bathroom, a kitchen, DVD player and a Hifi stereo. A sitting aera was also provided as well as tea/coffee facilities. The only thing I wouldrecommend is a newer TV (LCD or Plasma) and a more comfortable Bed forsuch a room. Otherwise ok.The Victoria Station is only 2-3 min walk as well as Bus and Tube station. Very conveninent after a long day shopping in the busy street of London.Try the Pub right next to the hotel (The Willow). Or the Wagamama restaurant at the shopping mall nearby. Theater and Music hall are right at the corner. Will surely come back again next time."
152,1040,"Nov 21 2007 	Great Value	We booked this hotel through Lastminute.com and found it to be just what we wanted and great value for money.The hotel was clean and modern and not at all pretentious like some of the other pokey,chintzy hotels we have stayed in in London.The room was a good size and not at all hot!The bathroom was fine but I would agree that it was difficult to turn on the tap because the shower screen got in the way!However,this is really just nitpicking.I would definitely use this hotel again and I tend to be quite fussy about where I stay!"
153,1040,"Nov 17 2007 	room INFERNO 	We stayed for 4 nights in Mid Nov 2007. THE GOODThe hotel is in a FANTASTIC location just 60 seconds from London Victoria. The rooms are a good size (for a downtown hotel) and the bathrooms spacious and well equipped.Staff are friendly, the restaurant and bar are really nice and offer good food. Overall the hotel has a nice fresh and clean feel to it.THE BADDespite turning off the heat and leaving the window open for 3 days our room remained incredibly warm throughout our stay. We mentioned it to front desk several times but were just told that the hotel was warm. There appeared to be NO A/C in any room.The other major gripe were the pillows. Akin to sleeping on a stack of newspapers these were some of the worst pillows we had ever seen. The beds were 'ok' but compared to Westin, Marriott etc they were a far cry from their blissful qualitities!We spoke with the manager on the last night and were given a fan for our room and complimentary drinks from the bar. They assured us that the problem was going to be resolved in the next few days.Would probably give this hotel another go as aside from the temp it had many great qualities as a place to stay!"
154,1040,"Nov 6 2007 	Nice Hotel Shame about the sweltering rooms!	We booked the Park Plaza Victoria on the basis of the ranking and write ups on his site and we weren't disappointed, at first...The Staff are polite and cheery however they did miss out several bits of information when we spoke to them on booking - this is the concierge at fault. We drove up so needed somewhere to park and as we had booked this hotel partly as it falls outside the congestion charge zone we had enquired about the availability of car parking either at the hotel or nearby. We were told Hotel parking was 30 per night and the NCP which is outside the zone is 22. Cool, I thought saving myself a few quid there, however you cannot get to the NCP without going through the CC zone so thats another 8, or you can pay 30 per night to park.... Not happy about that.....I was checked in efficiently and our room was clean and fairly spacious (Superior King Size) with a decent TV with SkySports - always a winner in my eyes. However the room was soooo hot I started sweating within 2 mins of being in there so asked for someone to come and have a look and was told that all the rooms were like this due to the unusually warm weather for November. Bit odd for a 4 star hotel not to have decent aircon. Still at least we weren't cold! We asked for an aircon unit and at second time of asking we got one. The bed was comfortable but not an actually a kingsize but 2 large single matresses with plenty of blankets to stop it from being a problem, on a kingsize base - a minor issue but a bit of a cheat.Bathroom is clean &amp; well stocked with great shower &amp; plenty of towels &amp; shower gel etc. Good wardrobe space, safe, tea &amp; coffee making facilities &amp; ice bucket.One gripe from my other half was that we knocked some stuff over in the mini-bar on arrival and asked for it to be checked (at 4pm friday) and on saturday night/sunday morning at 12.30AM we got a knock at the door (while I was asleep) and it was them coming to check. She was not amused.All in all a nice hotel with some good staff &amp; some muppetts and crap aircon.heating systems. Probably won't go again unless they have fixed the heating/aircon. Will check next time i come to London - please let me know!"
155,1040,"Nov 1 2007 	Good Location	This Hotel has a great Location and as i was staying for a business trip was very easy to reach from Paddington station.Rooms were average for the Price paid, and were unbearably hot. I was disturbed 3 times on the morning of my departure by house keeping staff wanting to clean my room which i did not appreciate on my one morning lie in!On the whole though staff on reception were very pleasant both checking me in and out of the hotel, and there was always someone around if needed.Breakfast was beautiful!"
156,1040,"Oct 17 2007 	Nice Quiet Central Location	Stayed in the Victoria Plaza with some girlfriends as part of a week-end theatre break.Upon arrival, first impressions were not that great. Hotel doesn't look anything special from the outside and the reception looked a bit odd (lots of pairs of pairs of jeans stuffed with reeds decorate the window areas!) However the check in at reception and concierge service were both superb, and all of the staff we met during our stay were very polite and helpful. The guest rooms were of a good size, very clean, modern and light with nice views and great balconies. We had upgraded to the excecutive package which includes robe and slippers in the room, sewing kit, hot chocolate, a couple of biscuits, chocolates and pieces of fruit, shaving kit and comb. You also receive complementary drinks and snacks in the executive lounge between 6-8). Probably not worth the money to upgrade as most of the items provided as usually given as standard in most 4* hotels. Breakfast was buffet style breakfast, plentiful with lots of variety, although &quot;hot&quot; food was only just warm. This is served in the executive suite if you upgrade which is relatively small. A number of guests were asked to return later or eat in the main restaurant.The hotel is in a great location, quite central and within easy walking distance to Victoria train and tube stations and the Victoria Theatre. There are lots of cafe bars, restaurants and snack bars all a short walk away. However, the hotel is in a nice quiet location and there is little if any noise at night (always a plus in London!)If you are looking for a good quality hotel in a great location, then you won't be disappointed with this one."
157,1040,"Oct 9 2007	Very nice hotel in a good location - walking distance to several London sights.	Trafalgar tours booked our rooms - and it was an excellent choice. Very clean rooms - close to Victoria Station, theatres, and other London sights. Staff was nice - especially in the restaurant - the waitstaff were very attentive and friendly. Breakfast was good - great variety. Would recommend this hotel to my friends."
158,1040,"Oct 8 2007 	Fantastic weekend!	I booked this hotel on a chance through lastminute.com as one of their top secret hotels. The chance paid off. I was visiting London for the weekend as a treat for my 30th Birthday back in the middle of July 2007. I was more than happy. We had 2 rooms booked and both rooms were modern, spacious, clean, light and airy and very comfortable. I had booked 2 Executive rooms and noted that we were there for my birthday and I believe we had a free upgrade as it was double the size of the other room booked and that wasn't small! So that was a nice little personal touch (although secretly what I was hoping for)! The only meals we had in the hotel over the weekend was breakfast each morning. This was lovely with a huge choice. Everything you would expect on the cooked breakfast front served buffet style, along with a large selection of cereals, fruits, pastries, cold continental meats, fruit juices etc etc. No need for lunch!!The location of the hotel was another huge plus. Ideal for following the tourist trail. 2 minute walk to Victoria station, approx 10/15 mins walk to Buckingham palace and 30 mins walk to Big Ben and London Eye.And last but no means least the friendly staff. From check in to when we checked out always a &quot;hello&quot; and a smile on passing.So basically in a nutshell, I would definately stay there again and have recommended to friends afew times since. (I shall be in touch for my commision)!!Thanks again for playing a big part in making my 30th birthday an event I will definately never forget."
159,1040,"Oct 4 2007 	A little disappointed with my visit.	I have regularly used the Victoria Park Plaza because it is good value at week-ends and very convenient for the Gatwick Express. We always book an executive room which comes with Club Lounge access and the bedrooms are usually very stylish. This latest visit we couldn't check in early which was not a significant problem as the concierge looked after our bags. When we finally checked in, the room was disappointing for an executive room and was a little jaded compared to normal. The Club lounge during the day is rather a waste of time only having a coffee machine and a few croissants left over from breakfast. Complimentary alcoholic and soft drinks are available from 6pm until 8pm and there are a few bits and pieces to snack on. The Club lounge breakfast is excellent however. I have previously rated this hotel a 5 on trip advisor but it needs to work harder as it gets older. Next visit to London will probably see us staying elsewhere."
160,1040,"Sep 26 2007 	3.5 Star Rooms 1 Star Service	Stayed here for a week in mid-September...Perfect Location, a 2 minute walk to the front lobby as we hopped off the Gatwick Express. National Rail, London's Underground and buses are also in the same Victoria station. It was a good base for us to get around on our 1 week Oyster Travel Card which was about 24 per person for Zone 1-2.Front Desk:Checking-in at 2:30pm was smooth although the front desk clerk didn't seem to like her job too much (i.e. not overly friendly). They also wanted to pre-authorize an additional 25 per night to cover incidentals which was not a problem for us but may be for other guests, be forewarned if your limit is not high enough to cover this on a lengthy stay.Conciege was friendly and booked us fast-track tickets to Buckingham Palace's state rooms opening which was very useful as it saved us about 2 hours in the lineup outside.Room: It was a standard King - clean &amp; spacious room, very large by London standards - typical North American hotel room size, comes with EU and N.A. format wall outlet, very convenient. A/C is nice &amp; powerful. View is of the adjacent construction site but we've always kept the drapes closed so not an issue for us. The &quot;King Bed&quot; was actually 2 twins pushed together with no mattress topper so you can feel the gap just underneath the bedsheet.Bathroom:The design leaves lots to be desired. The Shower-Bath combo did not have a shower curtain or a full door, only a half folding door which was not sufficient to keep the water out while showering unless you crunch up inside at the front of the tub. (see pic). An absolutely stupid design. The shower pressure is non-existent: completely limp. The toilet seat looked well worn, and the towels are like sandpaper from a cheap Holiday Inn in Alabama.Internet access:The Internet was 2.99 per hour and 9.99 per day for 56K connection - who uses 56K these days!? It's 2007! For those of us who don't live in a cave the regular high speed is 12.99 for 24 hours, about double of major US 4 Star Hotels (just like everything else in London). We found a cafe next door to the hotel that also doubles as an internet cafe in the basement. They charge 1 for 35 minutes and it was quite useful for us.Housekeeping:Here's where the real fun begins. They can be described only with one word - terrible. I have never in all my travels encountered such terrible housekeeping in a 4+ star establishment. In fact, I've had better housekeeping in a 2 star Florida motel, which is why I rate this service a measely 1 star.Where do I begin? The towels have stains on them on multiple occasions; The toiletries are always missing one or two items when replaced; The kleenex (tissue) box was not replaced when it ran out (the box wasn't new when we checked in), neither was the toilet paper on one night; The window was always left open during the day with the construction site immediately next to us - letting the dust and noise in upon our return; The sheets were changed once - the night prior to our departure; The coffee &amp; tea are never replentished and our cups were not washed on several occasions. All of these missing items we have to ask for practically every night to have them bring up. Other than making the bed and replace the towels, they did not do much during our 1 week stay.The Bottom Line:For 160/night + tax I really expected better, if I wanted non-existent service in an okay room I would've save 2/3s of my money and stayed at a hostel. What a joke of a so called 4-star hotel. If it wasn't for the location I would've regretted terribly to have picked the Park Plaza Victoria over the Hilton London Tower Bridge after much deliberations. The location of this place is their only saving grace."
161,1040,"Sep 12 2007 	One of the nice hotels in that area..	I have stayed at this hotel twice this year (2007). The hotel is just a short walk from Victoria station and for under GBP 90/night, I think it's a good deal. The room I had was of good standard, clean and the bed was comfortable. Everything else in the room works as it should. I did not try breakfast / dinner at the hotel and can't comment on that."
162,1040,"Sep 9 2007 	Nice room great lobby bar 	Stayed for a week. The room was of average size for any place other than London, but somewhat above average size for being in the center of the city. The closet space however was tiny. My window looked out into a back ally. Room AC worked well and the bed was confortable. The bathroom was spacious with a shower stall seperate from the bath. Breakfast was included with the price and it was a good selection with a nice atmosphere. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. It was a bit of an adventure to go for a morning run, I had to cross several busy streets adjacent to Victoria Station in order to make my way over to St. James Park. Nice residential neighborhood just outside the door with pubs and restaurants. Nothing fancy, but lots of casual dining choices."
163,1040,"Sep 7 2007 	Good Value For London	I booked this hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and was pretty pleased with it. I stayed in a standard room which was a decent size - in particular the bathroom which had a separate shower and bath. The furnishings were quite nice and modern although the room was a maybe a little bare. The staff were polite and helpful which was a bit of a pleasant surprise in this country. The hotel is very convenient for Victoria station (just a couple of minutes away) and sights like Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliment and Tate Britain are within walking distance. The area immediately around the hotel is fine with plenty of bars and restaurants - there's also a Sainsbury's nearby. Overall I'd say the Park Plaza is good value for a hotel in central London - I got a rate of 116 a night from the hotel's own website. One thing to bear in mind is that there is buidling work going on opposite the hotel although my room was on the other side so I wasn't troubled by noise."
164,1040,"Sep 4 2007 	location location	Modern, clean hotel w/in short walking distance to Victoria Station(buses, tube, train) as well as sightseeing buses nearby. Walked to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral(would not recommend).Rooms good size, great beds, bathroom very large. Didn't care for the all mirrored look though-a little too revealing for my taste!Many good restaurants nearby, all again w/in walking distance.Enjoyed our stay and being so centrally located to see so much and being able to eat dinner so close by after a long day. Try The Willow for breakfast-can't beat the full English breakfast for 2.5lbs-so, so cheap for London! Did not eat at hotel-too expensive, lounge ok, staff ok, some better than others. Basically just slept here so it worked for us.Would definitely go back."
165,1040,"Sep 3 2007 	A disappointment	We booked a 3 night stay at this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. After a long flight to Heathrow from Dulles, we took the subway to Victoria Station, and finally located the hotel after some time dragging our luggage about. Upon arriving at midnight, the desk clerk immediately said &quot;I have good news and bad news&quot;. The bad news was that due to the some alleged computer glitch, they had filled all of the rooms (this was after I had re-confirmed the reservation a couple of days before departing). It was a Saturday night, so I was skeptical. There were absolutely no rooms available, so the &quot;good news&quot; was that they had booked us in the Hisperia a couple of blocks away (a higher-end hotel in the same chain). They would pay the difference, but only for one night, then we would have to re-pack and drag our bags back to the Park Plaza the next morning. All in all, a real pain. We would have preferred just staying at the Hisperia, but that was not an option.The hotel management was very apologetic, but I didn't understand why a confirmed reservation (I had notified them in advance of our late arrival) was given up to another party.The room was sufficient - nothing memorable. The location was noisy, but very convenient to Victoria Station."
166,1040,"Aug 31 2007 	great hotel!!!!	great hotel, in great location, right round the corner from victoria train station, the only down side was the fire alarm in the middle of the night, when we did return to our rooms we had just settled back down to sleep when the tv came blaring on apoligising for the fire alarm!! but apart from that it was lovely, they was a good selection for breakfast, check in and out was fine too, would recommend to anyone"
167,1040,"Aug 25 2007	We enjoyed this hotel!	We have stayed in London several times and this hotel was by far the best. The location is great , just across from Victoria station. The rooms were spacious and had been updated. The beds were clean and comfortable. We booked 3 king rooms and received 2 king and1 queen which turned out to be fine. Would definately stay here again and would recommend to others. We did not eat at this hotel as it was 17pounds ($34) for breakfast a bit pricey!"
168,1040,Aug 17 2007 	very impressed	Spent 8 nights with Wife and 2 small children and could not have been happier. We received a great rate which included Full English Breakfast (served in the Executive Room) and were very impressed with everything. The location is great and there are many restaurants nearby. The ones we tried were all fine although we were disapointed with Bumbles. Staff in Hotel were very helpful (front desk organised online check in for our return flights and printed boarding passes).One tip. We arrived by train at Victoria with huge amount of luggage and even though hotel is close it would have been too much to manage with small children. British Rail porters are very good and one agreed to take us all the way to hotel even though they are not supposed to leave the train station.
169,1040,"Aug 17 2007 	Hotel good staff average	We selected this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. No real problems with the hotel itself. The location was very good, just up the road from Victoria Station, and near theatre and pubs etc. It was very easy to get around using the Underground.Most of the staff were eastern European (it seemed like the staff in every shop in London were eastern European) and were generally terse and unhelpful.As an example, there was tea/coffee facilities in the room, but they stopped replenishing them. I went to reception to get some more and was told in no uncertain terms that my level of room ( a standard queen) did not qualify for free tea and coffee. When I pointed out that we had been given it before I received a very harsh response. I let it go, and returned to my room, only to be rung by reception to say that they were wrong, and I should have got it, and they would send some up. A housekeeping staff member duly arrived with a minimal amount of coffee satchels, and a very surly attitude. A small example, but typical of several episodes in the week we stayed there.Overall rating - reasonable hotel, great location, poor staff,"
170,1040,"Aug 11 2007 	Nice Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for 8 nights at the end of July. The rooms were spacious and very clean, especially the bathrooms. The location was ideal. Very close to Victoria rail station, restaurants etc. While the staff were efficient I did not find them to be overly friendly. That is not to say they were rude, but they weren't overly eager to assist when, we as first time visitors to England, we wanted to know how to get somewhere. The restaurant was nice with friendly staff although quite expensive."
171,1040,"Aug 2 2007 	poor service	The accommodation was spacious and the hotel was very clean. You couldn't hear any traffic noise from the room - which is a real find in London. However, the service was really poor.Breakfast was 17 in addition to the room cost and on both days we had to wait for the buffet breakfast to be 'topped up' as they'd run out of nearly everything, the toast queue was also tideous as the toaster actually didn't toast and so it required several trips through the toaster to become anywhere near satisfactory.The conceirge was probably the worst I've ever met - when we asked him to recommend a good fish restaurant that wasn't too pricey he recommended a fish and chip shop in Waterloo!!!!!"
172,1040,"Jul 24 2007 	Reliable as ever	I now stay at the Park Plaza monthly as it is virtually the only decent business-class hotel near Victoria station - and I (unfortunately) speak from a wealth of experience regarding the competition.While the street location can hardly be called charming, it is very convenient - perhaps 3 minutes walk to Victoria. This is not a tourist are Inside, the hotel is modern. Renovated rooms, no creaky floorboards, working air conditioning/heating, working modern fixtures, working wireless internet (but expensive!). You'll need to be on the 7th floor or higher to have a view of anything at all. Decent exercise facilities in the basement ( which I don't often use as I prefer outdoor running). Restaurant is Italian-themed, and passable. Breakfast buffet is okay but sometimes overrun by those with it included in the room tariff. Staff (Eastern Europeans for the most part) are friendly (I always get a &quot;Welcome back, Mr. ****&quot;). There can be a back-up in the queue for checking in/out so allow extra time.Executive rooms (for an extra $50) don't seem worth it - not much difference if any in size, and it's too much $ for the free breakfast/happy hour in the 2nd floor lounge."
173,1040,"Jul 19 2007 	Extremely convenient comfortable and a good restaurant	I really enjoyed my stay here - I was in town for a conference at ExCel London, and wanted a nicer hotel near the Tube, so this worked perfectly for me. The staff was really excellent, and my room was comfortable and clean. Basically any location is within reach from the Victoria tube/train station, which is only a block and a half away. I went to the local Sainsbury's for the basics, and treated myself to a delicious meal in the hotel restaurant one evening. All in all, a very enjoyable stay, and I will remember this location for future stays."
174,1040,"Jul 18 2007 	One of the best I've ever stayed at	This is a wonderful hotel. The rooms are exquisite, the staff lovely and the breakfast very good. Location also good, access to all of London at nearby station."
175,1040,"Jul 17 2007 	Excellent Service 	My cousin and I have just returned from a weekend stay at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel, I must say this hotel offers a really great service and employ really helpful staff.We arrived at 12 noon and had to wait until 2pm for our room - which is normal in most hotels so no problems there. The concierge was so helpful he took in our bags and recommended some things we could do in the area until our room was ready.The hotel is in an excellent location it is a 2-3 minute walk from Victoria station - so very easy to get around London cheap and efficently, and for anyone going to see the show Wicked or Billy Elliot it is perfect as it is also 2-3 minute walk to both these shows.We were so near everything that we walked to Buckingham Place, St James Park and the London Eye all only 10-15 minutes away. The rooms are spacious and clean as are the bathrooms. The only thing I would fault with the room is the fact they don't have proper curtains they use lace trying to keep in with the modern appearance of the hotel - so not much sleep in the mornings due to the light. The hotel bar was comfortable for a drink after a hard day sightseeing, and the breakfast option available was also very enjoyable.The staff are so helpful here and will go out of their way to try and help you at all times. I will certainly stay at this hotel again when I am next in London.Tip: if your looking for a show to go see in London - I would really recommend Momma Mia it was a great nights entertainment not to be missed!"
176,1040,"Jul 8 2007 	Great location	Victoria Park Plaza has a great location close to the Victoria train station in a quiet area and the people working there are sweet and always helpful. The room was great except for problems with the magnetic strip on keycard (locked myself out once a day during the stay) and a broken massage shower which sent out a plastic thingy and hit my toe real hard (ouch - there was nothing wrong with the water pressure!).Please note: breakfast might not be included, but there are plenty of good places to eat breakfast in this area."
177,1040,Jun 28 2007 	Great location!	Stayed here for 2 nights. Fantastic location (5 mins walk from Victoria Station). Check in was smooth and the room was a reasonable size for London. Bed was comfy (but a double not a king/queen). Bathroom was a good size with a seperate bath and shower). There was a PROPER hairdryer in the wardrobe and a safe/mini bar). Walls seemed to be paperthin (or maybe we were surrounded by noisy people!!!!). Did not eat or drink in the hotel. Lots of bars/pubs around the hotel (worth exploring off the tourist trail - lots of local residents pubs nearby). Overall a good experience.....
178,1040,"Jun 27 2007	Close to Victoria Station	We stayed at this hotel for four nights. The check-in staffers were indifferent, although the concierge were pleasant. (For example, they were able to print off our airplane boarding passes the day we left.) The business center computer did not work. The rooms were clean and comfortable (goosedown comforters), although I spotted a few holes in the linens. The mirrors in the bathroom were heated, and there was A/C and satellite TV stations (including stations in Spanish, French, Italian, and German). One of the best features of the room: on the desk, there was a US power outlet, as well as EU and UK outlets. (No more using the adapter!) On most mornings we opted to not pay for the breakfast in the hotel and instead eat at nearby cafes. On the last morning, we tried the hotel breakfast. It was 12 pounds for the continental buffet, and an additional 4 pounds for the full English breakfast. We opted for the continental buffet, which included cereals, fruits, fresh pastries, yogurt, juices, and tea/coffee. (I noticed that the full English breakfast was also set up in a buffet style.) The hotel is close to Victoria train station/ underground (tube) station. There are shops and restaurants inside the station. This hotel would be especially convenient for travellers who fly into Gatwick, as the Gatwick Express train connects the airport with Victoria Station. Alas, we flew into Heathrow, and therefore needed to take a taxi to Paddington Station to catch the Heathrow Express train. All in all, the hotel served its purpose as a place to rest between sight-seeing, and if I am in London again, I would consider staying at this hotel again."
179,1040,"Jun 27 2007 	Best Four Star Hotel In London	Greetings,We have stayed at more than our fair share of hotels: Four star, five star, an occasional (regrettable) three star, but mostly four star. This is our favourite four star hotel in London. When you consider there are hundreds hotels competing for best four star, thats quite an accomplishment.The Park Plaza Victoria has become our favourite London hotel because Luke-Jozef Francois knows how to make his guests feel special, by taking care of the pesky details that rarely occur to the typical UK hotel. There might be other guest relation managers, in the hospitality business, who care about their guests as much as Luke does, but I have yet to meet one. When we stay here, Luke (and his exceptional team) make us feel like were staying with gracious friends who have been anticipating our arrival. Im not the easiest guest to please. As an American living and working in England, I have never grown accustomed to the tiny, airless, drab, dated, appalling rooms, too many UK hoteliers pawn off on unsuspecting guests. The Victoria Plaza is the antithesis of this: The rooms are bright, spotless, efficient and modern. The art throughout the common areas, adds to the buoyant feeling of the hotel. Choose the kind of pillow you want from a pillow menu in every room; the elevator actually moves between floors with ease. Eat in the bar; the restaurant, executive lounge (for snacks and breakfast) or one of dozens of options, within a few blocks of the hotel. Naturally, there is room service, but come on, youre in London, you dont want to hang out in your room, nice as it is.Given the option, go for an upgrade to a deluxe room, or junior suite. Youll have more elbow-room. If youre an American, get the junior suite. It will be just right for you. Things you might not think about, but probably should: Yes, there is air conditioning and it works well. The windows dont open much and this is one of my few complaints about the hotel. The windows need to open more. There is a wonderful, knowledgeable concierge who will always steer you in the right direction. Ask. Youre a couple of blocks from Victoria Station, one of Londons most popular train stations. It is an easy walk, even with luggage, from Victoria Station to the hotel. We do it all the time. Public transportation is excellent. You can catch a bus (take the bus, youll see more) to almost anywhere within a couple of blocks.Back to the hotel: The water pressure is good. The bathrooms have tubs and showers, sometimes separate, sometimes together. Thoughtful toiletries. The towels are a nice weight (not too thin) Executive rooms (and up) come with robes and slippers. Housekeeping is very good. Be sure to leave a tip for them. They work hard. The paper you request will be delivered to your door. We get The Guardian. There is broadband and coffee/tea making facilities in the room. Given the option (with your upgrade) have breakfast in the Executive Lounge. It is not as physically appealing as the main dining room downstairs, but the food and service are excellent. Get there early, or you wont get a table. Ditto for happy hour wine, which we mostly miss being out all day.A lot of Yanks seem to stay here, probably because it is as good as the 4-stars you find in the states. Hotel works equally well for business or pleasure. It doesnt cater to the wedding/conference crowd, which is what you want. Christmas is the best time to stay in London. You can get an excellent deal here that time of year.Things can wrong with any hotel, especially when they are fully booked. Things will go wrong here (and have) but the difference is they care enough to sort it out quickly. They care enough to consistently provide a welcoming environment. There are few hotels, I can say this about. When visiting London, I whole-heartedly recommend The Victoria Plaza Hotel. Viva La Vida!"
180,1040,"Jun 25 2007 	Location Location Location!	We stayed in this hotel in Sept 05 and were surprised by the location! When we arrived at the Victoria Station, we walked out and didn't know where to go so we got a cab and found that it was only &quot;a bit of a short walk&quot; from the station! The staff went above and beyond in helping us with anything we wanted or needed! They kept our luggage when we arrived so we could walk around and they also kept it for us when we went up to Scotland for a night and never expected anything for it! The room was large, clean and comfortable, felt just like home! We'd recommend this hotel to anyone! You can walk all over London from this hotel with no problems."
181,1040,Jun 24 2007	Money well spent	Very good quality hotel.The rooms the food and the public areas were all first class. We booked an executive room and used the lounge which provtded all free drinks and nibbles all day and alcholic drinks from 1800hrs to 2000hrs. The location is good and is about 50 mtrs from the Apollo Victoria theatre. Would recommend this hotel.
182,1040,"Jun 13 2007 	Best location	The hotel is beautiful, modern and extremely clean. The beds are the most comfy beds I have ever had in a hotel. You just sink right in and cuddle up with the wonderful duvet. Big, modern marble bathrooms. The bar and bartendars are great, as is the yummy pastry shop (you start to drool when you walk in). The location is the best. Right across the street from a busy train station (Gatwick Express arrives here), with plenty of tube lines. And a couple of blocks walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Green Park, St. James Park (so pretty), Horseguard Palace and Churchill's Museum and Cabinet War Rooms. Take a walk the other direction and you are in a regular neighborhood with non-touristy restaurants. PLENTY of dining options all around. We have stayed at the hotel twice and intend to stay here every time we go to London."
183,1040,"Jun 11 2007 	Beautiful Modern Hotel with Great Service	The Park Plaza has everything a tourist could want in accomodations. It has clean, modern and well organized rooms. The staff made every attempt to accomodate our needs. Probably the best reason to book here is that it is within walking distance to Victoria Station and for theatres. The restaurant is rather pricey, but the food was excellent and well-presented."
184,1040,"Jun 5 2007	Great location	An American in London for the first time (though I've been to 10 foreign countries), I was very pleased with this hotel. Great location -- just steps from Victoria Station, which you can't underestimate after a red-eye flight. It's in the heart of tourist spots and fairly priced by London standards. My one advice is ask for a high floor because street traffic can be loud during the day. Honestly, if people don't like this hotel, they're being picky. It's clean, close and cost effective and you're not going to be in the room much anyway."
185,1040,"Jun 4 2007 	Awesome Place	This is one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms are great, large for London and clean. The free breakfast was a great way to start every day. Many times the rolls and danish were right out of the oven. I think the location is the best part, though, because it was so easy to get around with the Victoria Station only a couple of minutes away. Oh, I forget to mention the SERVICE. It was exceptional. A very good place for fish and chips is right down the street called Sea Fresh. They get their fish in every morning so it couldn't be fresher. The portions are large and fried just right. Also, right across the street from Sea Fresh is a large grocery store that also has hot food. You can't go wrong staying at the Victoria Park Plaza. You will love it."
186,1040,"Jun 4 2007 	Great Weekend	We booked a special deal for an executive room with breakfast included. Have to agree with the other reviewer that the executive package really isn't worth the extra. We ventured into the lounge on the Friday evening and it was just like a waiting room at an airport.The bar downstairs was much more pleasant and we spent a few hours relaxing in it after seeing Shows in the evening. Our room was at theback of the hotel overlooking other rooms but it was great because itwas very quiet. The room and bathroom spacious, very clean and had all the amenities you would expect. The air conditioning in the room was fantastic and much appreciated as the weather was very warm. The breakfast in the morning was excellent as was the meal we had in the restaurant one evening. We found all the staff very friendly, helpful and in our experience we didn't have to wait at all. I found the staff to be one of the highlights of the hotel.The hotel is perfect if you are visiting to see Wicked (which is fantastic). If traveling by the Gatwick Express the Hotel is ideal as it is a five minute walk from the station without having to haul luggage up and down stairs! We felt very safe walking in the area at night. If going back to London I probably would stay in this Hotel and would have no problem recommending it to anyone."
187,1040,"Jun 4 2007 	Excellent!	Booked this hotel as a Secret Hotel option on Lastminute.com - what a find! We had booked a superior room only, however, on arrival were given the executive package which included full english breakfasts, bathrobes, slippers, welcome tray with water, chocolates, coffee and hot chocolate as well as full use of the executive lounge with free refreshments all day including wine, beer and canapes between 6pm - 8pm. Unbelieveable! I have stayed in numourous hotels around London and although the rooms may not be as plush as those at the Hilton the service was excellent. So close to Victoria - not only the tube station but also the fabulous new plaza with good priced chain bars and cafes. Would definately stay again but would also book with a web agency rather than directly as it was amazing value for money."
188,1040,"May 27 2007 	Bit disappointed	Having read the reviews on here I was a little disappointed with my 'executive' stay at this hotel. We had booked an executive room which was clean but v averagely furnished. It appears that the executive label means you get a robe, slippers &amp; free water I think rather than any larger or nicer room.The staff were friendly &amp; helpful but not v plentiful so often a wait occurred for the reception or conciege to even acknowledge me!We had access to the 'executive' lounge, a soul less room with a few tables and chairs, a tv and a tea/coffee machine - not exactly executive!Nice breakfast &amp; friendly &amp; attentive service there.Overall an average stay but I'm glad I'd got a last minute deal and not paid full price!!"
189,1040,"May 10 2007 	Absoulutelly superb service and staff	I have stayed with the hotel a few times whilst on business in londonand am always greeted by name and all of my favorite requirements arealways fulfiled. Besides the fact that I have come to know the staffquite well, Luke Francois(The Guest Relations Manager), Has been so helpful to me even when my computer broke down, and always making sure that all of my needs are taken care of. As a woman traveller, I especially find it very safe and curteous to be walked to my room, late at night when I usually arrive. The executive package is something I would definately reccomend. I remember on one of my visits when the power went down and I was using the executive lounge for my work, and Luke handled ths situation incredibly well, and maintained a team of his staff to re-assure everyone that the situation was being dealt with. A very busy hotel, in the middle of london next to the Victoria station, I always feel a sense of calm when I am there and I can get the rest on their superb beds! Being in the hotel industry myself, I wish I had more staff like The Victoria Park Plaza. Aditionally the conference facilites are great and the gym is well equipped and even have a spa!I particullarily like the lobby area which is quite funky and the decor is quite a conversation piece! I usually book by hotels.com but if you call the central resrevaions they are usually very close to the on-line rate. Its also quite handy as there are a few other properties which they reccomend if they are fully booked.A stunning place and a great place to enjoy sime time out! Next time you go to London, even if its just for a coffee be sure to check out the hotel! If you are lucky Luke or one of his staff may be able to give you a tour so you can really understand what I mean!"
190,1040,"May 7 2007 	Great value for Central London	A very good find offering a quality hotel experience at a very reasonable price for London. Just a minute's walk from Victoria train station and the Gatwick Express, it made a viable alternative to staying at an airport hotel in the middle of nowhere. Here, I was spoiled for choice by a street full of restaurants behind the hotel and a pleasant walk afterwards. The rooms were large, well-appointed, and all the furnishings were modern and in good condition. It will certainly become a regular London hotel for me."
191,1040,"May 3 2007 	Great Hotel making it my regular when in London....	Great hotel and in a great location. We got a wonderful rate through Travelzoo.com. Our room was great, we had a view of the London Eye and Big Ben. Room was standard &quot;American&quot; size which was big for London. Three of us stayed in one room and we had plenty of room. The shower was the best! It was powerful and hot. The breakfast was superb. Everything you could ever want. The location was right next to the Victoria Station and was so convenient. The Concierge was great. We booked all our tours through him. Really a first rate hotel. With the travelzoo deal we got the room, breakfast, two drinks, and a coupon for 25% off dinner in the hotel. I have nothing bad to say about our experience."
192,1040,"May 1 2007 	great hotel great service great location	I made a booking at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel for my girlfriends birthday after reading the good reviews on tripadvisor. I called the hotel directly and was offered a very good rate. The staff went out of their way to ensure that me and my girlfriend had a nice weekend. I called a week prior to our booking and spoke to the Guest Relations Manager Luke, as soon as he heard that it was going to be my girlfriends birthday during our stay he promised that he would have a surprise waiting for her in the room. When we checked in we went to the room and found a bowl of chocolates and a bottle of wine waiting for us. There was also a personal letter from Luke wishing us a nice stay.  We are looking forward to our next visit already and cant wait to come back to this hotel."
193,1040,"Apr 24 2007 	Always welcoming!	I have stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel three times in the last three months! Needless to say I think this is an excellent hotel in central London which is easily accessible to main attractions. You can walk toBuckingham Palace and the west end shows Billy Elliot and Wicked (which I have seen and is fantastic!). Our weekends are made even more enjoyable by the friendliness of the staff. Nothiing is too much trouble! Our rooms have always been clean and to a high standard and the food at both breakfast and evening meals are gorgeous. Numerous times reception staff have recommended other bars and restaurants to go to in London and each recommendaion has been first class.The guest reservations manager at this hotel must live there because he is always available to speak to if you need him. He is welcoming, friendly and very good looking! I would highly recomment this central London hotel. It's interior is very modern and you are guaranteed an fantastic stay."
194,1040,"Apr 19 2007 	London does have decent hotels	After a number of disappointing efforts at booking hotels in London for friends and family I thought the reviews here made this hotel look good.They were right.It's what isn't common in London - a modern, clean, working hotel in a convenient location (around the corner from the Victoria rail, Tube, and coach stations). Victoria itself is a bland commercial area but in the neighbourhood is the Catholic cathedral (visible from our room) which is OK on the outside but very good on the inside. Westminster is easy walk along the road (or catch a bus or Tube) with the Palace of Westminster, Big Ben (or it's tower!), and Westminster Abbey. Buckingham Palace is also near Victoria but really, it's just a dull boxy building.We didn't try the breakfast but the accommodation was perfectly fine. Seemingly new, the service was fine (what we needed of it - which was checking in and out), the bathroom was good (unusual in London).Not groundbreaking but certainly good by London mid-priced (read European high-priced) standards."
195,1040,"Apr 16 2007 	Nice hotel with great breakfast	We spend three nights at Park plaza. The room and the bathroom was nice and big to british standard. The service was good.I had send the hotel an e mail in advance, because of some comments here at tripadvisor that they had messed up the booking. I got a nice answer and everything was in order when we arrived quite late. The breakfast was excellent with fresh fruit and the restaurant was trendy and nice. We used room service once and the duck tasted very good. Nearby in direction Pimlico was a very nice italian restaurant with the best olives my son have ever tasted. In the reception it is a woman named Madelen who speeks sweedish for scandinavian guests.Thomas from Norway"
196,1040,"Apr 15 2007 	Great place to stay	We transferred to this hotel from Heathrow. We left our car at an offsite car park and travelled in on the Heathrow express, which was quick and easy.We bought oystercards for ourselves at Victoria station. The adult ones (for 7 days travel) were about 24. Our younger children travelled free with us, and our oldest (12), had to get a daily travelcard costing 1. These oystercards were fantastic. We travelled everywhere on the underground all week. They also covered travel on the Dockland Light Railway system. You just had to remember to tap them on the special oystercard spots on arrival at the station and before exiting the station.On arrival at Victoria station it is a little overwhelming to a newcomer to London. It is a very busy station, with people everywhere. The easiest way to find the hotel is to exit the station through the Marks and Spencer outlet. Or through the exit right next door to the M &amp; S foodstore. Turn right and walk down the road. Walk on passing a theatre advertising 'Wicked' on the opposite side of the road. Cross over the road using the crossing, and the hotel entrance is right in front of you through the revolving door. The hotel is only about 2 minutes from Victoria station. It is in a wonderful position as there are about 4 lines that pass through this station, meaning that you do not need to change lines so often.On our first night we left Victoria station by a different route and had difficulty in finding our way into the hotel..The hotel entrance is situated in a sort of tunnel joining two road together. (You'll see what I mean when you get there!).We booked this hotel after reading some of the reviews on Tripadviser. It was quite expensive, but I think that you have to remember that this is London, with London prices!We are a family of 5 and wanted to stay in a family room. Very few hotels seem to cater for families of 5 and we had to book 2 rooms.After speaking to the hotel directly, they confirmed that it would be possible for us to have 3 people in 1 room. The third person would sleep on a rollaway bed. (There is nothing on their website to tell you that a third person can share a room). However, to allow for a rollaway bed in the room we were told that we would have to upgrade to an Executive room. Obviously Executive rooms are more expensive than the standard 'superior rooms'. So we booked 2 Executive Rooms, one to sleep 2 and the other to sleep 3.On arrival at the Park Plaza we were checked in swiftly and given the keys to our rooms on the fourth floor. On reaching our rooms we noticed that the rollaway bed was nowhere to be seen, and we did not appear to have been allocated Executive Rooms. I had brought the information on the hotel with me, that I had downloaded from the internet, and it stated that Executive rooms should have complimentary bottled water, fruit platter, chocolates and upgraded bathroom amenities. None of these items were in our rooms.I went down to the lobby, and the lady apologised about the bed and arranged for one to be delivered to our room. She told us that we 'had' been allocated an Executive room and that the hotel rooms were exactly the same and it was only the 'Executive package', ie the bathrobes, slippers, fruit, water etc that made the room executive! If that was the case then surely we could have had a third bed in a superior room and saved ourselves some money!We were expecting a separate shower cubicle in our Executive room but instead got a shower over the bath. Anyway the rooms were both very clean. The bathroom was OK for size. There was a large bath, with a shower over. Bath robes and slippers were provided, as were the usual toiletries. No separate conditioner was apparent, just shampoo.The bed was huge, 2 large singles pushed together. TV channels fine, quite a good selection of free channels and some pay per view movie channels that we didn't use. A large desk and 2 chairs were in the room, and there was an opening window, that overlooked the street below.There was some noise in my husbands room from the building site outside, but this didn't bother him at all. The air conditioning worked well.There was a hairdryer in the cupboard outside the bathroom door. An iron and board was tucked away in the wardrobe.Plenty of room for clothes and cases, even with the 3 of us!The rollaway bed was a little bit old and saggy, but fine for my 9 year old.Linen was changed every other day, I think. Hard to tell! Towels changed if you left them on the bathroom floor. As for the 'Executive Package', I can't really recommend it. The 'fruit platter' turned out to be 2 apples and an orange! The orange was hairy, and inedible!There was no separate shower cubicle as we were expecting.The refreshments available throughout the day in the Executive Lounge left a lot to be desired. What was there was excellent but there was little variety and no sweet things at all. The children soon discovered the cans of fizzy drink in the fridge, and enjoyed taking these back to their rooms!Also we found that if we had been out for the day and returned to the hotel a bit later the Executive lounge was shut. It closed at 8pm. It would have been nicer if it closed slightly later.There were no free chocolates included in our package.We were given a bottle of still, and a bottle of sparkling water. But if you wanted more you had to ring housekeeping! I would have thought that this should have been restocked daily along with the fruit.We should have had the option of different pillow fillings, but nothing was mentioned to us.As it was we put up with the uncomfortable standard issue ones.We would have liked a 'welcome package' in our room with some literature about the facilities on offer in the hotel. There was a card on the desk, but this lacked information. Also a map and other 'touristy things' would have been useful.On our first morning we tried breakfast in the Executive lounge. (If you book the Executive rooms, you get a complimentary breakfast which you can have in the lounge, or in JBs restaurant).To get into the lounge you are issued with a pass. The lounge was quite small, and as a party of 5 we were lucky to get a seat.We were served tea and coffee, and we helped ourselves to everything else. There was a good selection of food available, cereals, pastries, hams, cooked foods etc. Very nice.We only ate in the Executive lounge once. We ate mainly in the large restaurant downstairs. There were always tables available downstairs, and I think that there was slightly more choice downstairs. The waiters were attentive and friendly. Only negative comment was that one waitress put us on a table for four on two occasions, even when there were larger tables available! Don't know why.We did get a knock on the door at 8.30 in the morning from housekeeping. The next evening we made sure that we hung the 'do not disturb' sign on the door!We ate twice in the JBs restaurant. There was no need to book, it never seemed to get very busy. The food was fantastic. Superbly cooked, and not overpriced.Even our children enjoyed the meal. They had a lovely menu to choose from. If we had had the opportunity, ( and the bank balance!), we would have gone back. We highly recommend it.In conclusion I would recommend the hotel. It's position makes it easy to travel around London.It was clean, the breakfast was plentiful, and the rooms were good. However, I wouldn't bother with the Executive package. It wasn't worth the extra!"
197,1040,"Apr 10 2007 	Great location	I have just returned from a weekend in London and had a brilliant time. We stayed in the Park Plaza becuase it was convenient for the Victoria Apollo theatre. It was the perfect location, literally 2 minutes from the theatre and very handy to get to from Paddington.When we arrived we were checked in promptly and offerred an upgrade from a non-smoking superior room to a smoking suite. I was reluctant at first to check in to a smoking room but there wasn't a hint of old smoke in the room and it was very clean.The breakfast was great and we were seated quickly. There was a nice choice of food and the chef did a good job making sure that nothing ran out.The only slightly disapponiting thing about our room was the amount of traffic noise from the road, so I would definitely take some ear plugs next time.I would definitely stay here again: clean, friendly, great location and brilliant value based on the discounted rate I received."
198,1040,"Apr 2 2007 	Great Hotel!	I really loved the Victoria Park Plaza. Its so close to Victoria station its perfect for getting around London. We got a great deal from Last Minute so the hotel was cheaper than the budget hotels like the travel inn.The check-in staff were nice and friendly. We checked in early from our last hotel and left our bags with the front desk as our room was not ready yet. The room was large by London standards. When we first walked in all we could here was traffic noise which worried me a little but turns out the window opens slightly so that was the cause. Once it was closed we couldnt hear anything. We were on the 4th floor and had a lovelly view of construction! Oh well I am sure it will look nice when its finished!I loved most things about the room. We had loads of toiletries The bathroom was nice and large. There was a fantastic selection for hot drinks options.There were also many tv channels to choose from. I know people do not go on holiday to watch tv but having Sky Sports 1, 2 and 3 meant we could watch the football highlights.The only issue I had with the hotel was on the first night at 1.15 the firealarms started going off. It took 45 minutes to get back to our room and most of that was because they were waiting for the firebrigade. Its not the hotels fault at all and they were very apologetic it was just very frustrating standing out in the cold for that long. I was just grateful it wasnt raining like it had been all day.I do think this hotel has so much to offer. Its location is perfect, the staff are friendly, the rooms are large and comfortable enough for a few night stay. I will stay here again when staying in central London."
199,1040,"Mar 28 2007 	Great location	Overall, this hotel was a great place to use as a home base for exploring London. The location is terrific - within sight of and less than a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, which made travel very convenient. Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace were also easy walks. The rooms were nice - not quite what I would consider 4 stars in the US, but clean and modern. My travel partner and I got non-smoking king rooms at good weekend rates (including full breakfast) on the Executive floor via the hotel's website about 2 weeks before our stay. We did experience some of the same staff confusion that other reviewers noted, including not having our Radisson points or airline frequent flyer numbers in their system, so we'll most likely have to claim those after the fact. The front desk people also had to keep running back into the office to ask the manager how to do things. These were just minor annoyances, though, and everyone was very friendly.Based on the location and overall experience, I'd definitely recommend this hotel to people looking for a great central spot from which to explore the city."
200,1040,"Mar 25 2007 	Fantastic stay!	We went to stay at the hotel for a treat for our birthdays, we booked through Last Minute and got a really good price. The hotel is just round the corner from Victoria but there was no traffic noise in the room at all, and despite overlooking a busy building site we couldnt hear a thing in the room.My sincerest thanks to the hotel for the upgrade to one of the junior suites, it really made our trip special, this was a wonderful room, wonderful superking bed, gorgeous bathroom with a bath and shower over, plus a big walk in shower too. The room and the hotel throughout has a modern but plush feel to it and I cant fault the cleanliness and service at all. Good selection of complimentary toiletries too- a whole rack full!We didnt eat at the hotel as we had a table booked elsewhere for dinner and our room rate didnt include brekkie. There is also a Wetherspoons almost next door which does a nice enough (and very cheap) breakfast menu! eg I think a fry up was about 1.50 but cant remember.I really cant fault the hotel or the service received and would def stay again if in London. I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and feel for the money we paid this really was fantastic!"
201,1040,"Mar 20 2007	OK+	Liked : - Very convenient location for travellers, close to Victoria station.- Rooms and bathrooms are moden and of good size. - Gym- Staff friendly and helpfull throughout. Did not :- I really feel that hotels of this class and pricing should quit trying to make a few pounds off the internet and other telecommunications charges, that today cost practically nothing. Charging 20 euros a day for internet access, 2 euros for local area phone calls and 8 euros for faxing a page does smell a bit like extortion to me.- Cleaning ladies knocking at my door ( however gently ) at 8 o'clock on a Saturday morning, and then again 45 mins later was a somewhat unpleasant experience."
202,1040,"Mar 19 2007	Cannot Believe this is a Four Star Hotel	I originally booked my room for one week at the Victoria Park Plaza. After being in this hotel for less than one hour, I immediately cancelled my reservation and booked a room at the nearby Rubens Hotel.One thing which struck me was the mix up with my reservation which I made for two adults and requested two twin beds. It would be understanable that the glitch was caused in booking my room through a third party. However all of my arrangements were made directly with the Hotel's customer service. The Hotel did accomodate me with a roll away bed, however the fact that the reservation was confirmed two days prior to my arrival is inexcusable. The condition of the room was also shoddy and unclean. The carpeting was in poor condition and was quite dirty and the bathroom's lighting did not properly work. The furniture was also in below average condition and the bedding was low quality. No extra blankets were provided. Not something you would expect for a four star hotel. The Hotel also did not provide any hairdryer or alarm clock as advertised. The Hotel's staff was also cold and unfriendly.For one, at 169 GBP per night during the week, the hotel is greatly overpriced. You are pretty much being billed for the location which the Hotel is less than one block of the Victoria Train Station and Tube. However, if you are willing to walk a block or two from the train station, there are better hotels in the area which are little less expensive and offer better accomodations. I would not return to this hotel, nor would I recommend it."
203,1040,"Mar 19 2007	Great stay!	I recently spemt the weekend at the Victoria park plaza. it was truly amazing. Beautiful modern interior, excellent bar with superb seating. They offered a wide range of drinks &amp; food. The breakfast was fantastic with a wide range of food from fruit to full english to croissants. The service and politeness from the bar staff and waiters was outstanding!  Great accomodation with a beautiful room. Highly recomended to anyone! This place should be a 5 star!"
204,1040,"Mar 14 2007	Starting to stumble?	This review covers a stay that just started - I just checked in a few minutes ago - this is March 14 2007.I've stayed in this hotel at least 5-6 times in the past year. Overall, it's good value for money, good rooms and well located.But I write this review for two reasons:1. Like many hotel that partner with British Airways, there is no credit appearing on my BA account from my most recent stay of Feb 13th. To test this when I checked in today, I asked the clerk if they had my BA number (I made sure to put it in the special requests section of the reservation website). She said 'no'. So, I gave her the number for this stay and it means I will manually have to claim the BA miles from my stay of Feb 13th. Poor service - do they even read that section of the reservations form?2. I booked a king non-smoking. When I arrived at 7pm tonight, only queen smoking or twin non-smoking rooms were available. No apologies offered - just 'which other type of room do you prefer?' I prefer what I booked - a king non-smoking. I'm smart enough to know that's not always available but do appreciate the apology and even an extra tidbit thrown my way when that happens - free in-room movie, or free breakfast. Something...So, anyway, I like this hotel and will give it another try, but I think the service has slipped somewhat since I started staying here."
205,1040,"Mar 13 2007 	Great Location Great Value	Great location withing a short walk of Victoria Station providing access to and from the airports and major attractions. The hotel itself is very well taken care of and has a modern decor. Large, well appointed room for a European hotel at a modest rate. Highly recommended if you are in London to see a show at a west end theatre. We went to see Wicked and it was no more than a 5 minute walk away. There are many cafes and places to eat nearby as well as a grocery store."
206,1040,Feb 18 2007 	Very happy at the Victoria Park Plaza	My girlfriend &amp; I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for a 30th birthday trip. It was recomended to us by a friend who had stayed there before &amp; who was suitably impessed. We got off the airport bus &amp; easily walked the 5 minutes to the hotel. We found it quickly &amp; were very happy with the modern &amp; stylish foyer. We were swiftly checked in and directed to our room. The room was very smart &amp; clean with loads of space and nice touches (great power shower!!). Our evening was spent relaxing in the lounge which was lively but very well served. We had a good bar meal which we found well worth the money. Breafast was in the executive lounge and we had a top class meal in a very relaxed atmosphere.We were both very happy staying at this classy hotel &amp; will definately be returning the next time we are in the capital.
207,1040,"Feb 11 2007 	Fantastic hotel	I stayed here for 1 night for a work conference and it was excellent. The hotel is modern, light and airy - my room was clean, with a comfy bed, great bathroom with good shower. The food was of excellent quality, particularly the breakfast where there was lots of choice. The staff were friendly and very helpful (on a particularly busy day!) - my only complaint would be that the bar prices are a bit on the high side, but other than that the hotel is marvellous!"
208,1040,Feb 6 2007 	Modern hotel with good location	The Victoria Park Plaza is a modern hotel in a great location. Just down the street from Victoria Station so convenient for side trips and also a short walk to Buckingham Palace. If you go in September you can have the change to get to tour the inside of the Palace as it is one of the few times it is open to the public because the Queen is away during that time. The rooms at VPP are a very good size compared to alot of hotels in London with large clean bathrooms. Our room was not ready when we arrived in the morning but they held our luggage and we returned a few hours later. Our room was on the 3rd floor looking down on a loading area and was very noisy until the wee hours of the morning so after 2 nights we did tell the front desk and they moved us to the same location but up 3 floors which was much better. Breakfast was okay - not outstanding but the one thing we did notice was that the waitresses did not smile and in fact really didn't make eye contact - very impersonal. All in all a good hotel that I would probably return to although I might entertain trying another location in London if we return just for the variety.
209,1040,"Feb 1 2007	Christmas at Victoria Park Plaza	My family and I stayed at Victoria Park Plaza over Christmas week 2006. Some of my family had never been to Europe before, and I had never been as an independent traveller - not with a tour group, so we were nervous at first. But the trip turned out absolutely wonderful. We took the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station and just walked across the street to the hotel. We awoke Christmas morning to find mince pies outside our door. What a treat. Christmas Day lunch in their restaurant was good and so much fun especially since we were away from home for Christmas. The rooms were extrememly comfortable, and the bathroom was 1st quality. The staff were very professional. The location could not be better. Across from Victoria Station, we easily travelled all over London. When we saw &quot;Wicked&quot; on the Friday night before we left, we only had to walk a block to the theater. I hope that I will be able to stay at this hotel again."
210,1040,"Jan 25 2007 	Nice hotel in perfect location	Travelled a group of four to this hotel in January 07 and stayed for two nights. We booked a room through travelzoo and got a very good deal at 81 for a executive room (ordinary 159). This included a lot of amenities, lounge access with full english breakfast and free beer and wine in the afternoon. The only problem with the lounge was the limited seating, so be early.Location: Very close to Victoria Station. Not easy to find the entranceHotel: Modern and clean with a large bar on the ground floor and a gym. Nice, well sized rooms with minibar and a pillow menu. Nice and clean bathroom with a shower and a tub. Service: The receptionists were excellent, the waiters in the bar was terrible."
211,1040,"Jan 16 2007 	Lovely Hotel Bar a nightmare	We got a deal on Travelzoo at 69 inc upg to exec lounge, free breakfast and discount on drinks and food. Was a FAB deal as hotel modern and well appointed, spa was fab and massages spot on. Great location close to victoria and Buck palace. Only down side was the service in the bar was painful slow, and sometimes lost in translation, we waited 15 mins to be served and 10 mins for the drinks to get to us, averaging 5 per drink, even for London that seemed expensive for Beer and and G+T's.Overall a great deal at the right money but wouldnt have liked to pay full for it"
212,1040,"Jan 15 2007 	Great hotel great staff great location.	Got a good deal on this hotel including money off in the hotel restaurant. The hotel itself was great, really modern and chic; all the public areas were spotless. Rooms were huge - bigger than some more expensive and exclusive hotels in London as was the bathroom - which had no less than 3 showers! The bed was ok without being great but we did get free chocolates and a fruit platter in the room upon arrival. The bar and restaurant area is lovely, food in the restaurant was really good but the atmosphere was a bit lacking - though did eat quite early due to going to the theatre. Breakfast was disappointing, English buffet was cold and uninspiring. The location couldn't be much better, 50metres from victoria station and tube; theatres for Billy Elliott and Wicked are on the same road. No bad traffic noise from the dual carriageway near the hotel. Highly recommended."
213,1040,"Jan 5 2007 	beware they mess up bookings	This hotel is in a good location which was exactly why we chose and booked it. On arrival we were told that they didn't have a room for us even though we had already paid for our accommodation. They moved us to their sister hotel - Riverbank Park Plaza, which was a very nice hotel but miles from where we wanted to be. If you chose the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel I would suggest you phone them before arrival to confirm your booking is with them and that you're not being moved to the other side of London."
214,1040,"Jan 5 2007 	Excellent hotel at a reasonable price	You can book this hotel for about 80 pounds a night on the internet. Word is getting around and the hotel is full most nights. The room size for London is really excellent and the rooms themselves are nicely furnished and have lovely bathrooms.Public areas are furnished in a modern style - very nice, apart from the loud TV in the lobby bar which nobody is interested in watching. Location is perfect. Steps away from Victoria Station.Very hard to beat at this price."
215,1040,"Dec 30 2006 	it was great!	Clean, nice accommodations - great location, close to victoria tube and train station. got a great deal over Christmas. would stay there again."
216,1040,"Dec 27 2006 	Good location	The best thing about this hotel is its location. Its steps away from Victoria Station, and a 3 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. If you're in London on vacation this location is really good. The room was good, it was a nice size, clean and had a comfortable bed. The service was the thing that brought the experience down. First, we had brought a bottle of wine in with us to have while we were getting ready to go to dinner the first night we stayed there but we didn't have a cork screw to open it with. We called down and asked if we could have it opened, and they said it would cost 3 pounds. We didn't really have a choice, because we couldn't get into it any other way, so we said okay and then waited 20 minutes for someone to come up. We called down stairs again, and about 10 minutes after that someone finally came up and knocked on the door and handed my husband a little white box. Basically we just bought ourselves a waiter style cork screw which we have 5 or more of at home already. Would it really have been that difficult to just open it for us with one of the bar's cork screws? Then after showers we noticed there was an ironing board but no iron, and then had to wait another 15 minutes for that to be delivered, thankfully we didn't have to buy that too. We stayed here 3 nights, and breakfast was included in our rate. Breakfast is served until 10am, but whatever you do, do not show up after 9:30 or you will only recieve rude looks from the staff. We sat at a table at 9:35am, and someone came over and told us to go ahead to the buffet because it was about to close. I said okay, but we were just waiting at the table to order some tea and coffee, which was then brought over without cream or sugar. A family of 5 came in a minute after us and the kids could barely get any food because everything was being put away, it was really ridiculous. This hotel has lots of potential if they can raise the standards for the staff."
217,1040,"Dec 12 2006	OK as short stay business hotel	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza for one night early in December 2006 as my regular 4* hotel in London was fully booked. This was my first stay there. These are my impressions:The hotel entrance/exit doors are not marked clearly, the doors are actually down a corridor connecting the 2 streets which this hotel is built between. So I ended up entering the hotel thru the dining room! There was also a hotel delivery vehicle blocking nearly all of the pavement causing further confusion. Check-in was reasonably quick, the female receptionist I dealt with was polite but obviously a little inexperienced. I asked for a quiet room but was told my room was pre-booked and was overlooking Vauxhall Bridge Road (a busy dual-carriageway), albeit on the 5th floor. I also asked for my Gold Points to be credited for this stay, she referred this query to a manager who then stated rather brusquely that as this booking was being paid for by my Company I was not entitled to points credit. Yet previous stays at other Park Plazas had been no problem, either way hardly an attitude consistent with good customer relations. I was offered help with my bag (just one) but didnt need porterage just for that.On trying to enter my room (via key card) I thought I had been assigned the wrong room number  the TV was already on (loudly) and all the room lights were also on. Maybe this is standard practise there and they control it remotely on booking-in, Ive never met it before though. The room and bathroom were a reasonable size and clean. Some traffic noise was noticeable even thru the double glazing. No noise was noticed from adjacent rooms. The TV had a fair number of channels, the pay-movies looked rather expensive though. The sink/taps in the bathroom were tarnished in places even though this hotel is just a few years old. The shower glass was inadequate, far too narrow, meaning that the bathroom floor gets wet when showering in the bath  note, no separate shower cubicle. The room service menu seemed rather limited, prices were about par for this status of hotel and area but the choice was not as wide as I am used to elsewhere  I didnt bother, but dined out. Breakfast menus  again standard fare and prices, 13 for CB and 17 for EB. Much cheaper food is available just a short walk from the hotel. I didnt touch the mini bar, prices appeared to be the usual exorbitant mark up. The usual room items were supplied: kettle, selection of powdered drinks, hair dryer etc, all were adequate. The best part of the room though was the A/C, it responded almost instantly to my temperature changes and the fan speeds available enabled me to circulate air even down to floor level  by far the best hotel A/C Ive ever experienced in fact. Check out next morning was also quite quick, 4 personnel staffing the counter, I queued for about 3 minutes before being served. The person dealing with me seemed unaware that I was required to sign the invoice (even though it was being charged straight back to the Company) until I pointed this out. No offer was made to call me a taxi. In summary: this hotel is perfectly acceptable for a short stay on business. Its unremarkable, the service could be better in parts, and there are other hotels providing more for the same money  but its OK. Its just that there is nothing special which would make me want to return here in the future rather than other similar hotels in the same area."
218,1040,Dec 7 2006 	First trip to London	I just wanted to say that this hotel was really nice. we booked last minute and for regular rate were upgraded to an apartment on executive level. All the hotel staff was more than helpfull and allways friendly and offering to help. It is very close to the Victoria Train Station so you can just walk and take the Tude (London Underground train system) to where ever you want for very inexpensive. The restraunt was great and daily english breakfast was definatly a must!
219,1040,"Dec 6 2006	First Class Welcome - First Class Hotel	I've been making the Victoria Park Plaza my home from home for the last few months. When you're travelling there is nothing better than being greeted by staff who know your name, your favourite room and your entertainment preferences. There is always a first class welcome from Luke and his team and not just for regular guests. There is a relaxing atmosphere and an excellent bar and restaurant. Eat at JB's and watch and listen to the chefs at work, while enjoying an excellent range of wine and an ever changing menu. I enjoyed steak tartare for the first time in many years, which was made extra special by talking to the chef afterwards and getting a feel for his passion for food and service. When you're in London, you'll be hard pushed to find anywhere as welcoming or with the outstanding levels of customer care and service.'Inspiring our Guests through Individuality and passion' - is their motto and this hotel serves it up with gusto."
220,1040,"Dec 3 2006 	A great hotel!	This is the first time I've used the Victoria Park Plaza and on the strength of our one night stay I've just booked it for our next two visits to London. Got an upgrade so was given an executive studio and I've just booked executive rooms for next time so can't comment on the standard rooms. The room was excellent with a huge and luxury bathroom with a host of thoughtful touches like mouthwash, toothbrush and toothpaste and a massive walk in shower plus separate bath. The room was very well furnished but as we were facing a building site it was a little noisy from 7.15am but not a significant problem. The receptionist on arrival was charming and he couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. Continental breakfast was fine and plentiful. The drinks in the bar are a little pricey but typical of London hotels. The overall ambiance is chic and trendy but nicely so. Modern decorations and lighting were atmospheric and wheras Christmas decorations can sometimes be tacky, these were far from that. Location of the hotel is great, a minute from Victoria Station so very convenient for the Gatwick Express to the airport. A super turkish restaurant is a minute walk away, give 'Kazan' a try. Not cheap but great food and pleasant wine for less that 15 a bottle. We went Saturday lunchtime but I called in the night before (a Friday) and there was a tremendous buzz about Kazan. All in all, I was very pleased indeed with this hotel and whereas before I used to use the Millennium Gloucester, for sheer convenience and style at a good price, this now gets my vote."
221,1040,"Dec 1 2006 	Great Hotel Great Location	I have stayed in Thistle Hotels and the Clifton Ford Hotel in London and let me tell you those hotels dont even come close in terms of service and accomodations to the Victoria Park Plaza. i stayed there last november 20th till the 27th 2006.The rooms of this hotel are bigger, more modern, more comfortable beds, the buffet breakfast fills you up, the staff is friendly and helpful. they said this hotel was renovated recently and it shows! the fitness gym is modern,(never got to use it though) and wired internet access is resonably priced, compared to internet cafes around and its fast too! in fact it was the staff that told me not to go wireless because of the price difference. Most attractions are close by too. dont even bother taking an expensive london cab to get around. Victoria station is less than 2 minutes walk (1 minute if you copy the locals crossing when the sign says dont walk) take the bus. #507 or #148 takes you to the london eye and big ben! or if you want, just walk it. it is a 20 minute walk from the hotel to westminster abbey, big ben, and another 10 minutes more walks you to the london eye and aquarium. there are lots of places to eat around that are less expensive by london standards. we went to paris for a couple of days and it was 1 bus ride (#507 again) to the waterloo station for the Eurostar. (took us 10minutes) at rush hour too! this hotel is centrally located, the concierge has a lot of good travelling and walking around tips, i had no problems, and would definitely stay here again!"
222,1040,Nov 30 2006	Brill hotel	Great hotel - after being re-located here from the Strand Palace - who had doublebooked our party of 49 giving us three days notice - we were a bit worried!! Needn't have been - lovely spacious and clean rooms - polite and helpful staff - let us leave our luggage while we went sightseeing./ Great breakfast with excellent service. Easy to access London sights - 4.90 tube ticket or 10-15 for taxi. Booked with theatrebreaks (Pat) who can thoroughly recommend as she re-located at very short notice and got us excellent seats for DIRTY DANCING. Great weekend - hard to please 49 women but not one moan!!
223,1040,"Nov 19 2006 	Good value well recommended hotel	Have just come back from a one (Saturday) night stay at the Park Plaza and - it being our second trip - am reminded that this really is a very solid hotel and I'd definitely recommend it. OK, so the design isn't particularly unique or designer-led and the rooms aren't particularly large, but that's really the extent of my criticisms, and they've definitely put a lot of thought into the layout. For example, the bedside light switch nearest you turns on the light on the other side of the bed so you're not blinded from a light directly above you. The mirror in the bathroom is heated; there's tea and coffee making facilities (and an iron / ironing-board) in each room; the minibar has space for you to put your own items in; each room has UK, EU and US plug sockets on the wall; there's an ethernet and modem connection; there's a desk-tidy in the drawer so your pens won't move around.Yes - they're all little things but they show that someone's gone around and thought: &quot;What would make our guest's stay more pleasant?&quot; and then made it happen. (And there are plenty of 5* hotels I could name where you don't get some of the amenities there are here). It's a Good Thing they've done here and when you discover each little touch, you're pleased because someone's thought about what you, the customer, wants.The location of the hotel is excellent - literally 2 minutes walk from Victoria station (you could be from the hotel front-door to Gatwick airport in 35 minutes) - and that also means plenty of taxis at Victoria or the tube if you need it. Oxford street in two stops anyone?I suppose if I were being picky, I'd say that the art-work in the foyer which isn't particularly inspirational, the concierge appeared to be more interested in selling tickets than providing a wide range of services, and the Executive lounge was a bit disappointing. But when you're getting this type of room for 80 from Priceline, you really can't complain.All in all - well done Park Plaza. We'll be back, and I hope others will too."
224,1040,"Nov 14 2006	Fine for a business stay	Spacious rooms (for London), fantastic location, decent breakfast, reliable wireless, and more quiet than I would have thought...I had specifically requested that the hotel not cancel my room (I booked a room for the previous night of my arrival since I took a red-eye) since I would be checking in around 8am. Of course they had cancelled it and told me there were completely full and I could shower in the locker room downstairs... after talking to the manager they magically found a room for me and allowed me to check-in. The rest of my stay was rather pleasant. Would recommend this hotel for a quick trip to London or for business."
225,1040,"Nov 10 2006 	a convenient hotel for a weekend in London	My husband and I stayed here for a weekend in early November, and it's a fine 4-star hotel. If you're expecting a 5-star hotel, you will probably be disappointed, but if you expect a convenient, relatively modern 4-star hotel, you'll be happy you stayed here. We didn't have breakfast or drinks at the bar, so can't comment on those. And we basically had no big problems, so no reason to chat with the reception desk much, which is exactly what we needed. The good- Convenient location, particularly for those arriving from Gatwick Airport. The hotel is literally 2 minutes away from Victoria Station. - Quick, painless check-in and checkout. - Clean, comfortable room. The bed was a double bed, not king sized, but it was comfortable. - The bathroom was almost as large as the room itself, with a separate bath and shower stall. Few times have I found such a brilliant shower in a hotel, with perfect water pressure, temperature, etc. - We had to request an extra blanket the first night (please see &quot;the bad&quot; below), and they brought it up to us very quickly. The bad- Room was smallish, but it was their standard room. - Few TV channels, and a rather lame Pay per View system. It only had 3 films available and they unfortunately didn't match the ones advertised in the catalogue in the room (a bit of a pain after we'd just decided what to watch). But then again, we weren't in London to watch TV. - We would have had to stay a few more nights to learn to regulate the room temperature. The heating worked, at times. The rest of the time, we had a choice between nothing and cold air blowing in our faces (thank goodness for the extra duvet). All in all, pretty good value for money and perfect for a relaxing weekend in London. One thing to note: we got a pretty good deal for the room online, which generally makes me feel more benevolent towards a hotel than when I pay full price."
226,1040,"Nov 2 2006 	Most enjoyable stay!	I stayed for 16 days in this hotel and each day was better than the one before. When I first got in, there had been some kind of confusion with my reservation and I had just coughed up a lot more money that I'd estimated on a cab ride to the hotel, but shortly after interacting with the staff, things began to pick up: The Guest Relations Manager, Luke Jozef-Francois is quite the character  very funny, down to earth, and very easy to get along with. Most importantly, he has a genuine concern for the wellbeing of his guests and makes it a point to interact with as many of them as possible. Of course the entire staff, along with him, was quite responsive to my needs but I think he especially made my trip memorable. I mean, how many Guest Relations Managers, of any hotel, have you ever met, yet alone remember after a stay in a hotel? Ive stayed in several hotels in New York and California and frankly, Ive never met a single Guest Relations Manager until Luke but Im sure each of those hotels had them.I initially had a regular room, no free breakfast or newspapers, and I was paying quite a bit for it too. I'd come to understand that London was generally expensive, and the hotel really wasn't bad so I wasn't going to complain. My wife was already in London when I got in and she came to spend some time with me. Once Luke got to know us, he and his staff took it upon themselves to make our stay there memorable: To start with, he gave me an upgrade to an executive suite with all the perks: breakfast and a paper of choice each day. What's more, he got me a better price on the room than I initially had for my more modest accommodations. The room itself was amazing! A complete apartment with all the amenities you could ever care for. Luke also recommended affordable restaurants in the area and convenience stores where we could find all our needs. He made recommendations for entertaining stuff to do while there and on his advice we went to see Wicked at the Apollo (just walking distance from the hotel) and my what a treat. The minuses have to do with the hotel itself, not the staff: There was little choice of TV channels (even in my executive apartment). There was no bottle opener in the entire apartment; I had to call guest services each time I wanted to open a bottle and most of the stuff I bought in London didnt have twist caps. Regulating the room temperature was never intuitive. Im not sure I got it even after 16 days there.All in all, I highly recommend this place. Get to know the staff, they are a wonderful lot and most helpful too.I had been in London purely on business, but my stay there was so relaxing that it felt very much like a holiday. I'm planning on going back to London later this year and you can bet I'm making my reservations with Victoria Park Plaza."
227,1040,"Oct 30 2006 	Excellent location -- Good experience!	We had a great time in London, and couldn't have picked a nicer location than the Victoria Park Plaza. Quick walk to Victoria Station, or about 10 minutes' walk to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, etc.The bar prices seemed crazy, but we may have been unprepared for how expensive London was in general. About double US prices for nearly everything.I'll admit we used none of the hotel's amenities (bar, restaurant, etc.) but whenever we needed a question answered, the front desk staff was quite helpful. We received excellent service, there were no unexpected charges on the bill, and our room was clean and relatively large. Nice, contemporary bathroom!Suggestion: the room rates for phone calls are silly. There are convenient internet cafes close by . . . they'll save you a bundle. Also, the Indian restaurant across the street is terrific!!!!CB BuchananMidlothian, Virginia"
228,1040,"Oct 14 2006 	Great hotel great location!	What a great hotel in a great location! London is expensive, but we knew that going in. We picked this hotel based on reviews and the price we got at bookings.org. Just down the street from the Victoria Theater (where Wicked is playing), the hotel is an easy walk to both Buckingham Palace AND Westminster Abbey. My Fiancee and I both love to walk all over the cities we visit and we had a nice time discovering London on foot. But, for the times we didn't want to walk, the tube is also just down the street!The hotel staff was lovely and the room was very nice! We did not get the breakfast option at the hotel. There are plenty of places around the hotel to grab a bite to eat. Here is a helpful hint... If you walk out of the hotel and turn LEFT, right down the street on the right hand side is a super market. We stocked up on water and some wine for the room so we wouldn't have to pay for the overpriced mini-bar - just a helpful hint! By the way... usually, you will be going right to get to the Tube (victoria station), the theatre for Wicked or Billy Elliot, Westminster, etc. are all to the right) Have a nice stay!"
229,1040,"Oct 6 2006	Average to good business hotel	I recently spent 4 nights here on business. I rate the hotel as OK, but not outstanding. The room I had was a good size, and the hotel had honoured my request for a quiet room (on the 5th floor, overlooking the minor road at the back). The room design and decor was fresh, and the bathroom was very modern, but still practical. I didn't eat in the place, except for breakfast. I only had continental, but this was fine, and the service was good.My only real gripe was the number of minor problems I had. The toilet wasn't cleaned properly when I arrived, the shower screen was off one of its hinges and in danger of falling into the bath , the alarm function on the TV didn't work (this was throughout the hotel, not just my room), and the cleaning staff didn't always refresh all the supplies in the bathroom. Checkout on the final morning was also achingly slow.To be fair, all of these problems (except the TV alarm) were corrected promptly when I raised them. However, I don't really expect to have this number of hassles with one room over 4 nights. If they could sort out the maintenance issues, and speed up reception, this could be a really good place to stay, in my view. As it is, it's just above average of its type."
230,1040,"Oct 1 2006	Nice place to stay	Big spacious room with good mattress on the bed. Clean and light.I appreciated the magnifying mirror in the bathroom.Good breakfast with great service. Front desk was helpful.Not a good view out the window, but otherwise no complaints!"
231,1040,"Sep 26 2006 	reasonable but what happened to the chocolate gateaux?	We stayed one night and the check in was more like a border crossing point and was interrupted by the staff member taking obviously more important phone calls. The concierge was very efficient in parking the car and bringing it back and we paid 30 for overnight parking and 5 for the porterage. The room was large and comfy, nicely decorated, it overlokked the building site but was not a problem with noise etc. I liked the heated mirrors in the bathroom. The shower is a little difficult to operate as you have to lean over and an incorrect selection ensures a wet shirt cuff. It is a great location for getting around as other reviewers have stated. We had a room service meal of one starter and main course with free half bottle of wine for 26 and the food was of the highest quality, It was delivered very warm and within 15 mins of ordering. However having retured from our show we had a nightcap and ordered a chocolate gateaux for my wife at 10.55pm. The staff apologised for the wait of 15 mins due to only one chef being on duty instead of two, and then came back 5 mins later to say that the fridges had been locked and that the chef could not get our gateaux. We laughed it off and got a 10% discount off our drinks. We got back to the room and decided to try room service for the gateaux only to be adfised that they had now &quot;sold out&quot;. For a large london hotel this is poor i know its only minor but its the little things like this that makes your stay more pleasureable or beomes a moot talking point.A comfy nights sleep but the bizarre reading light arrangement is frankly a nonsense the left hand side turns the right hand side light on, what on earth is all that about?We did not check out till 1030 but between 9 and 1030 the maids visited us twice to tidy the room again a simple check with reception should suffice. Checking out was another crossing the border moment but extra staff ensured we werent interrupted by phone calls.Its a nice modern hotel, its not cheap and so the check in should be more efficient and much quicker. the fridge should be left unlocked for late night chocolate binge eaters. I have stayed and will stay in london many time in the future I would only choose to stay here again on a special cheap offer basis."
232,1040,"Sep 26 2006 	Very enjoyable stay.	My wife and I stayed here back in May and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was friendly and the rooms spacious. The location is great , tube station, restaurants (If you like spicey, try Nando's) and grocery store very close by. Would absolutely stay here again."
233,1040,"Sep 25 2006 	Hotel staff rude and unhelpful... Will not stay here again	My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Victoria Park Plaza Hotel. We had booked a superior room and upon arrival discovered that this in fact was the hotel name for a 'standard room'!!!The room was basic compared to other 4* hotels we have stayed in across Europe and we were very dissappointed. The hotel definately mislead customers into thinking they are getting more for their money by calling their standard rooms 'Superior Rooms'.Furthermore, the walls must have been made of paper as we could here EVERYTHING that was happening in the rooms either side and the room above so if you have children beware that you could here some night-time activity!! This was extremely unpleasant to say the least!The hotel also take a 50 deposit from your debit/credit card upon arrival which they do not mention on their website. We were assured by reception that the money would not be taken out the bank account as they were not authorised to do so... However the next day when I went to the bank I discovered that they had in fact taken the money out of my account. I have still to see the money credited back into my account and think that it is an absolute disgrace that they lied to me and took my money without my consent.The hotel did not ruin our stay in London and we did enjoy the fact that the hotel was in a central location with lots of bars and restaurants near by. However we would NOT stay in this hotel again and I am positive that there are better hotels in the same area for less money, better quality and better customer service."
234,1040,"Aug 20 2006 	Front desk was rude and very poor service during Breakfast	We had booked this hotel early on our tour for Europe and Pre-paid in advance. My daughter and I had booked a tour with AAA visiting several contries from Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France and ending out tour in London for 2 days. We checked in and was told that we had to open up a credit line of 25.00 in order to make telephones calls. First, I declined because we had already purchased a pre-paid calling card and had no problems with it in the other countries. Well, we couldn't make a phone call. So, I went downstairs and gave them a credit card to open up a credit line of 25.00. I was never told that we had to do that and I saw one staff member give me a side glance.The next day for breakfast, we were given a seat with no greetings or explanations about the breakfast that was included with our room stay. No one came and cleared our table as we went thru the buffet line. No one smiled or anything. I usually give a tip and I let a few Pounds on the table. I saw a server pick it up and put it in his pocket. He never came to our table to provide any service except to pick up the tip.However, the conceirge's desk was extremely helpful in locating a place for my daughter and I to have dinner. He also helped us find a tour group in London.The room was decent sized. The bathroom was nice. It was good to be close to the Victoria Subway station.I will not be staying at this hotel again. I will not recommend it to my family or friends that travel to London. I will stay elsewhere."
235,1040,"Aug 20 2006 	Fantastic Hotel	Only stayed here overnight but was given an upgrade to a studio on arrival as they were fully booked. Could not fault the stafff and the room contained everything you could possibly want. The room was spotless and very large for a London hotel, it even contained two TVs, one near the sofa and one near the bed. The only downside was the traffic noise which really only let up between 3 and 3.30 a.m. but then I guess thats what you have to expect when you stay in the middle of London! Hotel is just a short walk from Victoria Station down Wilton Road. Did not eat at the hotel as there are numerous restaurants nearby so can't comment on that for you. I noticed on another review a mention about the reading lights over the bed and yes we also found that the left switch turned off the right and vice versa, so if one of you intends to read and one to sleep, you have to get out of bed to switch the light off and then walk round again in the dark so mind your toes! Can see some of our American friends found the people sleeping on the streets a bit disturbing and I can understand this but you will always find people like this in and around this area. If you are really worried I suggest you eat in the hotel at night but I walked passed many doorways where people were set up for the night and was only bothered by one man asking for change. Suggest you just ignore them, don't let it worry you too much and have a good time!"
236,1040,"Aug 13 2006	Great location -- disappointed with service	We selected this hotel based on the rave reviews and the location near Victoria Station. The location was great, but we were disappointed with the hotel service right from the beginning. We arrived around noon after an 8-hour red-eye from the states. We had requested an early check-in and I had verified with the hotel, and they said they would do whatever they could. We had a very tired 8-year-old when we arrived and were told that our room wasn't ready, but our room would be next on the list to be cleaned. Because we had reserved the room with the complimentary breakfast, she said that we could eat in the restaurant or in the executive club. She said to check back with her in an hour.We went to the restaurant, but were not allowed to eat (unless we paid) because we didn't have a room yet, so we went to the executive club. We were not impressed...slim pickings and not very high quality food. We returned to the front desk in an hour, and our room was not yet ready, but said they would call housekeeping. We waited in the lobby for another hour. The manager approached us and I was very hopeful, but it was only to ask me to wake my sleeping son and have him remove his shoes. After another half-hour, my husband asked to speak with the manager about our room. We found it hard to believe that there wasn't a single room available in the entire hotel. We were given a room, but it didn't have the sofabed, but they would provide a cot at no extra charge. As tired as we were, that was suitable. I was disappointed when looking out our window to find a huge construction zone. But fortunately, we didn't hear the bulldozer like another reviewer.We were there at the beginning of their heat wave, and the A/C worked fine except the last night, when it started leaking -- not a drip, but a steady stream coming out of the ceiling. It woke my husband and I up at 4 a.m. I called down to the front desk and they didn't have anyone on staff to fix it. She said the same thing happened the night before in the room beside us. She offered to move us to a different room but we didn't want to wake our son, so I asked for a discount. She said I would have to talk with the day manager at check-out. When we checked out, we were told by the front desk staff that they wouldn't be able to give us a discount because of the heat wave and they couldn't control the weather. I said that was unacceptable and asked to speak with the manager. She said that this had never happened before and that she couldn't give us a discount. I told her that apparently it had happened to the room next to us the night before. She then conceded and gave us 50% off the room rate for the last night, which I greatly appreciated. Also, we were charged for several items from the mini-fridge that we did not use. They removed them.But we do have good highlights as well: The location is great -- within walking distance to many sights, and to Victoria Station (The Tube and Gatwick Express). The concierge provided us great tour information (bus), and obtained great seats for Mary Poppins (although we had to hunt him down to find the tickets), and the manager of the restaurant did allow us to eat breakfast when we arrived a half-hour after it closed. Additionally, another staff member allowed me to enter the executive club to use the Internet after hours to inquire about our delayed luggage.Compared to the rest of the reviews, we are the exception...but I would definitely choose another hotel when I return."
237,1040,"Aug 11 2006 	Extra charges prevent this hotel from being perfect	We stayed at this hotel at the end of a 3-week trip through England, Wales, Ireland, Germany, Austria, and France.We got an extremely good deal by booking well in advance through Expedia. I've stayed at lesser hotels in London for far more money. The hotel is nice and modern, and very North American in terms of quality, service, cleanliness and room size. The other 2 hotels of this type that we stayed in on this trip - the Brooks Hotel in Dublin and the Millenium SI-Centrum in Stuttgart - are certainly inferior. Our room was large, with abundant lighting and stylish decor. The bathroom was clean, and the shower was powerful, with both a standard head, and a handheld head. The only odd thing about the shower was the short glass door which let some water onto the floor. The bed was a very comfortable full king, with white sheets and a nice duvet. A North American outlet was nice to have and useful. The location of the hotel was perfect: steps away from Victoria station, but on a quiet street. For us, it could only have been better if the Heathrow Express train went from Victoria instead of Paddington. But Gatwick Express does go from Victoria, so if you are flying into there, I'm sure that would be ideal. Lots of cafes, food stores, restaurants and bars are nearby. Bring drinks back to your room, and use the ice machines located on every floor. Try to buy from markets or newsagents, as the food places in Victoria station tend to charge alot more. If you like to walk, Westminster Abbey and Parliament are close by, as is Buckingham Palace. It is certainly no stretch to walk to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square or Covent Garden, and if you get too tired on the way there, just take the tube back, although bear in mind that the last trains often run around midnight. From Victoria, it is very easy to get the tube to anywhere you might want to see, often with no more than one change. And if you prefer to go by taxi, the central location keeps the price down. Another word on location: I did not find it seedy or scary at all. We felt totally safe walking around in the middle of the night.I have absolutely no complaints except for one: extra charges. Charges for the breakfast, drinks in the bar, and the minibar were the most expensive of any of the places we stayed at in Europe. Often times the prices were the same in Pounds as they had been in Euros in comparable European hotels. But what irritated me the most were the phone and internet charges. I made four short local calls and was charged over 30 Pounds. It is cheaper fo me to call my friends in London from my home in Canada! If you want to use your calling card, prepare to pay a 1.50 Pound connection charge. Internet was nearly 4 Pounds for 15 minutes, and the business centre had very limited hours. The executive centre had a 24 hour computer, but that required payment of an extra 25 Pounds per day to use, and the internet wasn't even included. In this day and age, it seems perverse to hit people with those kinds of telecom charges.In short, if this hotel did away with these sorts of charges, it would be flawless, as it otherwise provides exceptional value for the money. Even so, I would definitely stay again."
238,1040,"Aug 8 2006 	Great Hotel near Victoria Station	We stayed here at the end of July during the extremely hot weather, and were very pleased with the air conditioned rooms. Very Cool!The location is very convenient just outside of Victoria Station- (be sure to take the Hudson Place Exit from Victoria Station next to Platform 1)Service was very professional and our room was very comfortable.A well appointed hotel lobby and lounge area.We were also pleased to receive a nice letter from the Park Plaza regarding the comment card that I left at check out. Nice touch!We'll certainly stay here again."
239,1040,"Aug 7 2006	Great location great hotel!	Just back from a two night stay at Victoria Park Plaza in London, and thought the hotel was great! We got a great deal on Expedia, and weren't really expecting the hotel to be as good as it was.Just around the corner from Victoria station, it was a great base for our weekends shopping. Upon arrival, there were no queues to check-in, and the reception staff were lovely. The whole process only took about a minute, and we were on our way to our room.The room itself was lovely, we were given a double room, although I had requested a twin room when confirming the booking - but the bed was huge and very comfy so we were happy enough! The room itself had everything you need - a good sized modern bathroom, which was spotless, an ironing board, tv and all the other things you would expect (tea making facilities etc).We didn't take advantage of the breakfast because we thought it was a bit steep (16), but in Victoria station there are loads of coffee shops where you could grab a pastry and a cup of coffee on the go.The hotel lobby was very impressive withan airy minimalistic feel, and the bar was very nice too. We stayed in the bar late on Friday night, and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us.Overall, a really pleasant experience and I would definitely go back if I was staying in London again."
240,1040,"Aug 4 2006	Great Stay at the Park Plaza	We stayed in an executive room. It was a large and clean room, very well kept. The carpeting, sheets, furniture, curtains, and bathroom was spotless. The bathroom was spacious and modern in decor with marble. We also had complementary robes and slippers as well. This room is definitely not small compared to European standards. The room came with a complementary tray of extra toiletries such as a comb, shower caps, and sewing kit. We were welcomed with a small fruit basket and two small bottles of still and sparkling water in glass bottles. The room also had outlets compatible with US standard plugs as well as European ones. The air conditioning was very effective, especially in the recent heat waves in Europe. There was an ice machine on every floor as well, which is unusual for European hotels. The staff was very friendly to us. We had no problems checking in and out. We were served very quickly. When our room card had been demagnetized and we were locked out of our room as a result, they were very helpful in quickly re-issuing new keys. The concierge was knowledgeable about the area and they offered a free London map as well.The area is not too bad. It is near Victoria station, about 2 blocks around the corner. However, at night there are some homeless people at night, but for the most part, it was fine. During the day, the streets around the hotel are well traveled by tourists and locals going to work. It seems that the hotel is near some business buildings. There is a good variety of restaurants across the street as well as down the block ranging from American to Asian and others. There is also a mall about 2 blocks down as well. Behind the hotel, there is a street full of restaurants, a supermarket (Sainsbury), and a chemist. This street behind the hotel is very nice and not seedy at all as some had described. There are a lot of food choices.Our room also came with complementary breakfast in the executive dining room, which we accessed with our key card. The room was lovely with tables covered with cloths, cushy sofa chairs, and a wide variety of cold and hot items. We had cereals, eggs, cold and hot meats, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, breakfast bars, pastries, rolls, juices, yogurt, and coffees. The staff was very friendly as well and served us with a smile.The only downside was the construction behind the hotel. Most of the time, they were not working. One night, they were however, but it was not for long and we managed to sleep after that. Just ask for a room that is not on that side of the hotel and you will not hear the construction. One of our rooms was on the other side of the construction and we were not bothered by the construction. We have stayed in other hotels in London as well as around Europe and they were not as large or clean as this one. It was a nice surprise and a good value for the price we paid."
241,1040,"Aug 3 2006 	A great nights stay	This hotel is above standard in their attitude to their customers. Everyone from the reception staff to the cleaners is polite and more than helpful. Credit where credit is due, this hotel is unique.Clean rooms, loads of space, lovely breakfast, centrally located, what more could you ask for in a busy metropolis.The use of the executive suite for afternoon tea etc, and drinks between 6pm and 8pm is another touch that makes you feel special. well worth the small extra cost..... highly recommended! We loved our short stay and would definately stay their again and highly recommend to anyone who asks..... If in London it must be the - Victoria Park Plaza Hotel."
242,1040,"Jul 30 2006 	Very Pleasant stay at Vicoria Park Plaza	I'm not sure what people expect in London. This hotel offers incredible deals (we got a nice discount deal). This is a very stylish and cool hotel that is conveniently located in center of London. You can grab a cab, take a bus or train, and go anywhere in London. Loved the hop on and off bus that you can catch a couple blocks from the hotel. The breakfast was OK by hotel standards with all the usual fare. The real surprise was the food in the bar atrium area just off the lobby, very good pasta, burgers etc. Kids loved it. The rooms were modern with all the conveniences and comfortable. This is a great value considering how expensive London is -- don't know why people would complain. You shouldn't be disappointed here."
243,1040,"Jul 29 2006	Large Room Huge Bathroom	A very well located hotel, 2 blocks from Victoria Station in London. Very clean, neat, renovated hotel, from lobby to the sleeping rooms.In our standard room we had a large clean bathroom with 2 showers, (good water pressure). Large sleeping area, with sitting area, comfortable beds, newspapers every morning (Free continental breakfast).Sockets to plug in US, Europe or UK plugs (no adapter required)Easy walk to Buckingham Palace region, Victoria Station (for buses, trains and Tube stations), so easy to get anywhere in the city.Will stay there again in the future. Check the web for good deals, we were mid-week for 69 UK pounds per night."
244,1040,"Jul 26 2006 	One Man's Meat etc etc	Found none of the problems recent visitors seem to have had.Staff were helpful and courteous.Room was clean, cool and well stocked, didn't use the mini-bar but then who does except people with more money than sense.Breakfast, included in price, was more than adequate.As for the seedy area, I can only suggest these people should get out more often. Any city railway station attracts streetlife and if that bothers you then avoid railway stations !!"
245,1040,"Jul 24 2006 	Spend your money elsewhere	I booked this hotel for three nights, and then for another three nights once we were to return from Paris. I must admit I was reluctant to return to the Victoria Park Plaza for the second stay I pre-booked. After sitting on a plane for 7 hours, traveling to the hotel from Heathrow, and all the jet lag I had in me, I could not wait to get to the hotel. We get there about 1pm, check in, and the front desk tells us to come back in about an hour and a half when our room is ready. That was no problem as we were there before check in (I had requested an early check in, oh well). We return an hour and a half later, and our room is still not ready. By that time the lobby is full of people waiting on rooms, and we proceed to sit for another 45 minutes in front of the desk. It took us going back up there again for them to finally start calling around for keys. In the days we stayed there, you always knew it was check in time by the tons of people sitting around waiting in the lobby half-asleep with luggage while the staff stands around.The rooms are definitely more form over function. Things look nice, but for example, the light switch beside your bed turns on the light above the other bed to reduce reading glare according to their card. Well, what about the person who is trying to sleep on the other bed? It just doesnt make sense. They said they had room service, but we had no menu. Our remote control didnt work, and the pillows were about as fluffy as a cardboard box. No problem though, as I know hotels are done a bit different in Europe. The next morning, I got to wake up to a wonderful bulldozer. Across the little two lane street there is a huge construction project going on, so I couldnt sleep off my jet lag. The only reason I didnt cancel my second stay for when I returned from Paris is the convenience to Victoria Station where I needed access to the Gatwick Express.For our second stay, check in was much better. She told me they only had smoking rooms left (booked non-smoking, and I got there at check-in time). I was okay with that, and asked her if she could put us on a side with no construction to which she was nice enough to do that for us. Walking into that room was a whole new story. Apparently they just left everything out of our first room, because this one actually had the room service menus, access to the minibar, and everything else they tell you your room provides. The room was quieter, but thanks to the cardboard pillows, I am still suffering from a sore neck. When our express bill came, we were charged for things in the mini-fridge we never took, so be sure to check your bill. Overall, I did not feel as though I got what I paid for. I will not recommend this to other people, nor will I ever set foot in there again. I can usually overlook a lot of things, but the inconsistencies in rooms, and the horrible unfriendly hotel staff make this place a complete NO in my book."
246,1040,"Jul 21 2006 	The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in.	We booked this hotel on price, figuring that for the price we would get good service. We paid 300 pounds per night for a serviced apartment as we have a small child.Our DVD player did not work and after several days of complaining they finally told us there was nothing they could do about it.The shower was terrible and the airconditioning was non existant. If we asked a staff person about something or other they would say &quot;Oh, I dont know about that you will have to ask...some other department.&quot; Overall the worst service we have ever had."
247,1040,"Jul 21 2006 	Nice hotel if a little pricey	Stayed at this hotel 20/07/2006.Was in an EXECUTIVE room so this review may differ from others.Hotel itself is in an excellent location - 2 mins walk from Victoria tube. Location is let down slightly by the fact that there is a massive building site directly opposite at the moment hence our view out of the window looked like a shot from the second world war after a doodlebug had landed! Would add however that this site created little mess and no noise at all that affected our stay and the view isnt great from any hotel in that particular area because everything is so built up.Hotel lobby was very nice .. unusual scupltures made out of denim jeans and twigs (see other reviewers photos) that made me smile.Reception staff VERY helpful and friendly - a rarity in London hotels - on both check in and check out.Downstairs lounge area was very popular although didnt use it myself.Executive room was spotless and nicely decorated / lighted. Bathroom was large and well decorated, air con was spot on for these ridiculous temperatures we are having at present. Executive welcome tray was a nice addition - additional toiletries / extra coffee and chocolate / water / fruit .. very good after travelling.My usual mini-bar warning - this is an electronic bar and as such even moving an item to put your own water in the fridge will see you charged for it .. I didnt fall foul of this but always see fit to warn people these days :)Executive 'lounge' was nice (card access only for executive room members) .. free drinks in the evening and a very nice breakfast the following morning.It was expensive - probably wouldnt have gone exec if I was paying out of my own pocket - but it was a very nice stay nonetheless and would recommend my experience to anyone."
248,1040,"Jul 17 2006	Very Average	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights last week. I had booked a king non-smoking and they gave me a queen smoking. The girl at the desk tried to convince me that a king sized bed isn't that much bigger and when I told her that I know the difference because I sleep in one at home she offered to try to move me but I declined because Ifigured I might get a worse room. The room didn't smell of cigarette smoke at all so the fact that it had an ashtray in it didn't bother me. The real reason that I didn't want to move rooms is because they charge a ridiculous 15 pounds a day for internet access (thought the information card on the desk says 9.99 pounds) and I was fortunate enough to be on the 1st floor where I was able to pick up an unsecured wireless signal from a neighboring apartment. The mattress was sub par and I didn't check but I believe it may have just been a foam rubber type. The modern upgrades in the hotel are a little over the top for me. I sincerely doubt that thye will spend the money to keep it up and the full size mirror on the back of the tub is already starting to look terrible (you can see it in the candid pictures; the one of the tub, check out the edge of the mirror). Functioning air conditioning was a plus and if anything it actually got too cold (rare to hear that from a southern american). There is no vending in the hotel at all and if you want a soft drink late at night you're either stuck paying the two pounds in the mini-bar or god knows how much for room service. There are no 24 hr convenience stores in the area even though it is only a block away from Victoria Station."
249,1040,"Jul 11 2006	A bit pricey but nice	We stayed at the hotel for one night and it was in a bit of a seedy area. I think that for the price we paid per night we should have recived breakfast in the package. It is next to Victoria Street Station so it was convenient getting to Gatwick airport, but I am not sure if the convenience was worth the price..."
250,1040,"Jul 5 2006 	Great hotel central location	This is a beautiful hotel just minutes away from Buckingham Palaca and right around the corner from Victoria Station, which makes it quite comvenient for getting the Gatwick Express train to the airport. Spent two nights here on the tail end of a business trip/vacation and wish I would have had more time. Very spacious rooms and bathrooms with A/C that you can control - and that actually turns down far enough to be comfortable (unlike other European hotels). Nice restaurant/bar, with the ability to order breakfast ala carte, which I've found was rare in the UK. Very comfy beds also. Highly recommend this place for business and leisure travelers. I couldn't believe we only paid 139 GBP per night. It was a steal."
251,1040,"Jul 3 2006	Awful Hotel	Stayed here for one night. We wanted a 4* hotel on the doorstep of Victoria Station and this fitted the bill and looked great from its description on the web. How wrong we were. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I would never never ever stay here again or recommend it to anyone . The staff were indifferent, the room was pokey, dirty and the towels smelt and were unclean. This was far from value for money."
252,1040,"Jun 19 2006	Good value	Well situated for public transport, both tube and bus. Comfortable room which we booked on a special rate through travel zoo. We were upgraded to an executive room which was part of the deal but found that none of the extras were available until we requested them, i.e. welcome tray, bathrobes, slippers and face cloths. They did arrive quite promptly. We could not access the executive lounge due to problems with the card keys and when we did on the 2nd day we found it a bit of a disappointment with very little in the way of refreshments. Breakfast in the restaurant was very good and offered a really good variety of hot and cold food. I wish they would not cook so many fried eggs at once as the later ones become rubbery and unpleasant. Our deal did not include taxes and this resulted in a further 17.5% VAT added to the bill but it was still good value. We would return."
253,1040,"Jun 15 2006 	Very Comfortable	Great hotel, modern, clean and quiet. The rooms were of good size with all the required accessories available. The fitness center was more than satisfactory after a day's outing.The staff were friendly and attentive. Always at your service. Could use a few more international TV channels, the bathroom was a bit slippery and the shower door was hard to manage but besides these minor complaints, was a great hotel."
254,1040,"Jun 14 2006	My view of the Park Plaza	Just got back from vacation yesterday and thought while things were fresh in my mind I would give my impression of the hotel (7 June-13 June). The hotel is in a great convenient location that is just a 5-minute walk from the Victoria Train/Tube station. Just out the side door and down the street.The front desk staff was very helpful and polite. My only complaint would be that when checking out they ask if I would like the bill in US dollars but failed to tell me that there was a 3.5% charge to change it. The room was clean but showed wear. I had to ask for a washcloth each day, they would leave clean towels but never wash cloths. We had an executive room that included breakfast and access to the lounge but they changed the lock code every day so I had to swap the key card each day. The only refreshments in the lounge most days were coffee and bottled water. The breakfast bar was very plentiful. A good hot breakfast of toast/rolls, bacon and sausage, scrambled and sunny side up eggs or order omelets, potatoes, tomatoes, beans and mushrooms. They also had a cold bar of cereals, juice, and fruit with bread and cold meats. Some of the wait staff could have been more efficient, they would stand and talk, but most were very helpful. The last morning I had to get up and leave without finishing my breakfast when I watched one of the waitresses pick her nose and rub it on her shirt I am glad it was the last day."
255,1040,"Jun 12 2006	Good value	This hotel is a good value for travelers. The room was especially comfortable, the shower was fantastic, the hotel cleaning staff is exceptional. The carpeting needs to be replaced in the common areas. We were charged 25 pounds for a fax, which was outrageous. The best bet is to use any of the several internet cafes for email, faxes, etc. The restaurants in the neighborhood are not good, except for Jenny Lo's on Eccleston, and the Grenadier, an old pub in Belgrave."
256,1040,"Jun 7 2006	Wonderful Clean and Modern Hotel!	My husband and I recently took a trip to London, Paris and Rome. We were expecting to like Paris and Rome much better than London, but to our surpise London was absolutely amazing! We both feel this had a lot to do with our stay at the Victoria Park Plaza. I have a bit of a phobia of dirty hotels and generally HATE sleeping in hotel beds. The Park Plaza was clean, beautifully decorated and in a fantastic location. I felt very comfortable. We took the train from the airport which took less than 30 minutes and was only about $15/per person. We walked to the West End, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey from our hotel. They're not right next door, but they were all within reasonable walking distance through very safe, commercial areas. When we were tired of walking (we're office people - not used to all of the walking) the hotel was a block from Victoria Station and we'd just hop on a train to wherever we needed to go.I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on our next trip to London!"
257,1040,"May 30 2006	great hotel but	this hotel is in a great locaction, staff very helpful ... very clean hotel ... stoped in the exec room very clean and large....breakfast could have been warmer.. this his our view"
258,1040,"May 27 2006	Good Location and Modern Looking	This hotel has a great location that is just a skip and a hop from the Victoria Tube station.The bar section is open and airy.The front desk staff were very helpful with directions and cashed one of our travelor's checks.We scratched our heads looking at the art work in our room but I guess if that's the most to complain about, you're doing ok.The bathrom floor can get pretty slippery. I didn't care for the funky glass door in the shower that doesn't fold all the way. The room was spacious and quiet.Overall, this hotel fills the bill."
259,1040,"May 18 2006	Chic and convenient	i have now stayed at the Park Plaza Hotel 3 times and will definitely return every time I am in London. It is incredibly convenient being about 100 yards from Victoria Station (which has a direct train link to Gatwick Airport). But, more importantly, it is a work of art from top to bottom. It is ultra modern without being unomfortable and has fascinating paintings and sculptures at every turn. (Try deciphering the poetry over the bar!) Even the doorman and the reception staff are part of the art work with their sleek black outfits. The rooms are elegant and well appointed and the bathrooms are a dream. On my last visit the hotel was full so they put me in an apartment on the 8th floor - I didn't want to go home! This is London living as it shoudl be and I recommend the hotel to anyone who doesn't enjoy staying in a featureless box."
260,1040,"May 16 2006	okay but only if you get a deal	I hesitate to give a four star hotel a 3 rating, but it dissapointed for a 4 star. The room was nice, bit cannot be characterised as big. We were there on a weekend special which included an upgrade to an executive suite, which was a nornal room with bath robes, slippers, a few extra toiletries and a fruit/chocolate thingy. The room was clean. The executive lounge was well appointed but I would have rather seen it appointed with more options for daytime drinks (only had a coffee/hot chocolate machine) and perhaps a snack or two. The evening drinks were much better, but for a short time. The breakfast somewhat redeemed the hotel as it was tasty and plentiful. There were charges for wireless, and not just a nominal fee (why isn't this free at a four star?). The location was good, esp. if you are there for the theatre or need to get on the tube. Get a deal or look elsewhere."
261,1040,"May 14 2006	Some Trickery	The Victoria Park Plaza is a comfortable hotel, but it lacks some honesty by the desk staff. My husband and I are a mature couple who were traveling out of the USA for the first time. We read all the major travel guides to be aware of the scams. Several of them were attempted on us by the desk staff. We had to set them straight. This eliminated any false charges. Too bad you cannot trust the hotel you stay in."
262,1040,May 12 2006	Great Hotel	Stayed in this hotel on the 5th and 6th of May after reading the reviews on Trip Adviser and for the second time this year I was not let down byTrip Adviser (booked hotel in Rome earlier in year- another gem) we had booked a room for 2 nights but a very helpful girl at reception (from Germany) told us for the extra charge we could upgrade to execative suite which we did and thought it excelent value. The location is great you can walk everywhere if like me you like to walk or if not you are just beside main line and tube station. I cant fault anything really in hotel but (there is always a but isn't there?) for the orange juice in the morning it was like water - maybe it was all the ice in it but for a little expenditure it would have made breakfast perfect. We stayed in room 125 and our overhead lights seemed to be wired wrong which meant when my husband read late he had to get out of the bed to turn off the light from my side(as I was asleep) but really everything else was so perfect it didn't upset us. Having read reviews about unhelpful staff I cant say but I always found them most courtious and helpful.
263,1040,"May 9 2006	BEWARE HIDDEN CHARGES	It is such a shame the management just doesn't understand that travelers are savvy and it's important to be upfront and honest instead of hiding prices everywhere. First of all, there are some great special rates for this hotel...so one thinks. I booked the hotel for 4 nights, with the inclusion of the Executive Plan (breakfast, hors d'oeuvres, limited drinks) and free internet. First of all: the free internet is one hour of dial up which will barely open your e-mails. I called prior to booking the room and was told that the internet was &quot;wireless&quot; and &quot;free&quot; with the Executive Package. When I told management this, they did nothing, didn't even offer me a free pass for the day. They said the internet was an outside service (apporx. $ 40 US per day) and once you connect you have to stay connected or you get charged the full amount again. The Executive Plan also includes a safe big enough to hold a 15 inch notebook computer... yes, that is true, but if you can't disconnect from the internet, what good is a safe? They also urge you to dine (under the Executive Plan), included in your rate either in the Executive Club (a small room, but nicely appointed) or in the lobby's spacious restaurant. I chose the restaurant. What they don't tell you is that you have to pay for your own coffee, teas, etc. in the restaurant...and a waitress will come by every 10 minutes asking if you want coffee or tea. So the &quot;included&quot; breakfast, they get you for over priced coffee and tea. If you serve yourself the coffee and tea in the Executive Club room there is no charge for it. The rooms are small, but clean and well maintained. The location if you are interested in theatre can't be beat... they have a good product, but all the hidden costs continue. When I went to check out, they charged an 18 % tax and a 3% fee to use a VISA credit card (not a debit card) but a VISA card. This is, in addition to whatever charges your own VISA card will make. So by the time you are done, you have to figure the price of the room is actually 20% more than what the internet rate says. We also had the fire alarm go off and everyone ran out of the building. When we returned after standing out in the cold for 20 minutes, we returned and passed by the General Manager of the hotel who didn't make any apology whatsoever, and didn't even say thank you for your cooperation. Nothing. I don't think there was a fire, somebody just pulled the alarm, but it was taken very serious. I won't stay at this hotel again because I don't like to be tricked into paying a higher price than advertised. This is the way the hotel makes money, which is a shame, because it is a lovely property. The front desk staff is not very friendly at all and will not help you if you have any problem...they just don't care. The hotel is booked full to brim all the time, but after awhile, people will catch on that this place is full of deception."
264,1040,"May 1 2006	Good Stay - A nice hotel for London	My wife and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in mid-February. I was in London on business and my wife came along to be the tourist. I'd rate it as a 3.5* hotel.I've been to London over 30 times in the past 10 years. I'm required to travel on Federal Per Diem rates, so the 5*, first-class properties are not within my travel budgets. I'd say that the Park Plaza was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at for the rates I can pay.Unlike most hotels in my travel budget, the Park Plaza is a modern facility with high-speed internet access available. The rooms were large and well-appointed. Staff was friendly, and very helpful in assisting my wife with directions.The location to Victoria Station is convenient and it is an cheap and easy (but long) Tube ride from Heathrow to Victoria Station. There is one change in trains required to transfer to/from the Piccadilly Line to the District or Circle Lines -- but at a couple of stations it is only a 25 foot walk across the platform to make the connection.I'll definitely be staying at the Park Plaza again (as long as the rates stay affordable)."
265,1040,"Apr 30 2006 	Excellent handicapped facilities	My wife, who is confined to a wheelchair, and I stayed for a week at this hotel during the first week of April. We found the staff to be friendly, competent and attentive to our needs. The restaurant is top notch, excellent menu. The concierge staff made bookings for us on the London Eye and made sure that we got the best rates. The hotel is well located, only a two-minute walk to Victoria Station and tube. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The washroom had an accessible shower which my wife really appreciated. The only problem with it is that there was a tendency for water to spill onto the ceramic floor which was slightly slippery. I suggest that you put down extra towels to take care of the leakage. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at the Victoria Park Plaza and we're planning to return next year for another week."
266,1040,"Apr 24 2006	Over-rated	4* rating is too high.Breakfast poor and cold by 9:30King size bed was two singles pushed togetherStaff friendly, if slightly clueless.Disappointing120 per night you can get much better deals."
267,1040,"Apr 14 2006	Great hotel	This was a great hotel, especially if you're able to get a special deal on travelzoo. The three of us (two adults and a 15-year old) got an upgraded room (not suite, just larger room), a welcome package (fruit, water, extra toiletries, and candy), access to the executive lounge (evening drinks/appetizers and English breakfast), and passes for two for the Open Bus Tour (hop on and off tour of London) for 79 plus tax. The room was very nice (especially by European standards) with a nice bathroom. This is a relatively new hotel; so, everything is new, clean, and modern. The location is extremely convenient too, although we took public transportation from Heathrow (the express train and the tube). I would not recommend doing that - it's too complicated with luggage; lots of steps. The hotel is extremely convenient to Gatwick, though (we left from there). The express station is practically across the street. The evening drinks and appetizers were a little disappointing - drinks were fine, but the appetizers only included small eggrolls, potato chips, olives, and pretzels. We came down a bit late the second night and our only choice was chips or pretzels. The breakfast was fine, however. I'd definitely recommend staying here, especially if you can get a deal."
268,1040,"Apr 6 2006	You won't hear a thing	I wish there was a rating between 3 and 4, because it really is better than average in some respects. The best things about this hotel are the soundproofing and the beds. Once you are in your room you will not hear toilets flushing in another room, noise from the corridor, people walking overhead--nothing. One night workmen were drilling around midnight on the street below and the windows blocked out the sound. The beds were comfortable and the room was large, hard to find in London. Our bathroom had a big tub. The decor is rather bland, however, and I was surprised that there weren't more trendy touches, considering this hotel is just a couple of years old, including a not very modern television. The staff is young and pleasant. The location is superb, just a couple of minutes' walk from Victoria Station."
269,1040,"Mar 30 2006	Close to being excellent - but not quite!	Things listed on plus side:+ Location. Two minutes from Victoria Station, from where you can easily get everywhere in London. Subway and buses leave there. There is even one bus stop right beside the hotel. The area is not so bad as it used to be.+ Room size. The room and also bathroom were big in London standards. We were travelling with a baby and therefore wanted to book a hotel that had big rooms. We were not disappointed. + Cleanliness. The room, linen, curtains, bathroom - everything was clean.+ The english breakfast. Quality was good. I ate english breakfast every morning and that really kept me going late in the afternoon.+ Bar and a restaurant. Even though the prices are not very inexpensive, there is a nice bar and a restaurant serving good quality snacks and food.+ Gym. I didn't use it, but I went down there to take a look. It's nice that you don't have to leave the hotel if you want to use the gym.(+) Service. We got an extra heater after the housekeeping had left the window open for a whole day! And it was about +2C outside.Then things on minus side:- Cost of the breakfast. English breakfast will cost you 16 pounds and that IS a LOT! Continental breakfast was 4 less, but have that only if you are trying to lose some weight.- - Service and flexibility. See service above (our room was freezing, but that must have been an accident). Because we had a baby (six months) and our plane was leaving at 5 pm, I asked for a late check out (2 pm). The night before I was told it would be okay and I was asked to confirm it next morning. When I tried to do that, they told me they'd charge 10 per hour. I was really amazed and asked it free because we would have to chage nappies for our daughter and she would need a nap before long travelling home. When I asked it for free, they refused to do it and reason was, that there were a lot of poeple coming in and they could not keep our room for us for two extra hours. A minute ago it was possible if I had payed 20 pounds!?! A late check out would have been luxury for us and decent service from this quality hotel, but they chose not to serve our family. I have never ever been charged for late check out.The staff were friendly though.After all, we were satisfied with the hotel and would (probably) stay there again (if we don't need late check out). There are more good things on the plus side."
270,1040,"Mar 23 2006	What a Pleasant Surprise	I recently spent 3 nights at the Victoria Plaza. Having stayed in quite a few London hotels, I was skeptical about the room size, cleanliness, location, etc.The first thing I noted when I got there was it's proximity to the Victoria Station. It was about two minutes walk away.The concierge staff were very friendly and gave me a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The room was a nice size as was the entertainment/work area. The bathroom was SPECTACULAR. It was ultra-modern with a separate shower and bath (with a shower in the bath as well). The floor, tiles and tub were spotless. I am extremely fussy about bathrooms and was really impressed with this one.I have read complaints about the temperature control. I did not have any problems. The gym was way better than I could have expected with top of the line equipment. It was empty for most of my stay which meant I had the run of the place.There are lots of inexpensive eateries near the hotel but if one prefers to eat in the hotel, the restaurant is pretty good (if not a little pricier than the outside restaurants).I highly recommend this hotel. I only wish I'd taken pictures of the bathroom to share with all of you!"
271,1040,"Mar 23 2006	Would stay again for the right price	Had the same GBP 79 rate as another reviewer with lounge access, breakfast, and two tour bus tickets included. Did not have the mini-suite, however.Mostly tourists here on the weekend, but lots of conventioners and business types checking in on Monday.Good location, literally a 2 minute walk to Victoria Station. No trouble taking the tube from Heathrow and rolling our luggage over to the hotel. Some decent pubs and so-so restaurants in walking distance, but no restaurants I'd travel to this neighborhood for on purpose. About a 20-minute walk to Parliament Square/Big Ben/Westminster. Easy access via tube or bus to all of London from here.Room was big enough, somewhat larger than other &quot;standard&quot; sized rooms in the UK, but not much. Bathroom has funky frosted glass door and funkier glass sink/counter. Good shower, but no curtain, just the half-door typical of European hotels. Bring your own soap, as the hotel amenities are paltry and not replenished adequately by housekeeping.There is a major construction site across the street, but it didn't bother us on the 7th floor. Could feel the ground shaking during breakfast on the ground floor one morning, though!Executive lounge is, in a word, craptacular. Free wine and beer nightly, and assorted snacks. Staff was very, very, very slow to replenish snack selections. One or two warm snacks offered, but they'd disappear quickly. Two kinds of beer, and a red and white wine selection. I would not pay extra for lounge access.Breakfast in main restaurant was buffet style English breakfast. Fried eggs set out were a bit rubbery, and scrambled eggs were often not hot (or even warm). Had to flag down waiters for coffee refills. Otherwise, buffet was OK. Staff was alternately disinterested or busy being berated by the extremely cranky manager. Charge I think was GBP16, which I'd never had paid were it not included in our room rate. Easy enough to find a pasty in the neighborhood or station if you don't want to break the bank for a mediocre hotel buffet breakfast.As others noted, a modern decor throughout hotel. Art was not my taste, but it's not a reason to skip staying here. Talked to other guests who found the artwork quite interesting. To each his/her own.Front desk staff that checked us in was brusk. Gave me a hard time for asking for an higher level room rather than first floor room, but ultimately gave me what I wanted. Check out staff was pleasant.Overall opinion: good value for London, good location. I would not pay a premium for lounge access if it weren't included in the package we got. A good rate would lure me back to this hotel, but would skip if much higher. We expected to get value, location, and cleanliness over service and this hotel lived up to that."
272,1040,"Mar 7 2006	Comfortable But Noisy!	At a deal of 79 plus VAT per night for 2, including breakfast, entry to executive suite, free tourist bus and boat tickets you really cannot complain, expecially as we were allocated a mini-suite. It was also very useful being able to leave our bags for later collection on the final day.Avoid rooms overlooking the front - incredibly noisy. Only heating/ventilation through air-con so at night freeze or put up with the noise (you can't!). Bathroom no heating at all - brrrr!! Parking too expensive at 30 night especially when hotel admits car park empty at weekends. Not really anything in the area apart from Victoria station, but taxi only 7 to West End. Friendly staff but try warming the breakfast plates!For what we paid, great value."
273,1040,"Feb 24 2006	Tolerable	I used Hotwire (discount booking service) when booking this hotel and paid around $120/night, which is an amazing deal for anything in the UK. However, it seems you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this hotel to someone looking for anything but a good deal. The location right next to the Victoria tube station was great, but it lacks anywhere to eat that is nearby, except at the train station. This is a huge station though, so it does have a handy resonably priced grocery store, book store, and many breakfast/coffee places. They were able to check us in right when we got there after our international flight at noon, so we lucked our in that respect. We thought it was a handicapped room, but looking at other photos on tripadvisor, it seems they may all look like that. The rooms are small and relatively clean, but chips on furniture and some stains on carpet distract the eye. The bathrooms are odd, but look alright on photos. Bathrooms remain very chilly at all times and ours had a creepy pull down seat in the shower. Our view was of another building. The garbage trucks at 6am was not a very welcoming London experience. As stated before, I do agree that the front desk staff is just young people, mostly inexperienced guys. Again, a tolerable experience, but not a luxury visit by any means. Only stay if you find a deal."
274,1040,"Feb 21 2006 	Avoid this hotel unless you're desperate	I've stayed at this hotel many times (maybe 10 in the past 2 years) and have never had a stay without some significant problem, which is almost always compounded by the poor service. Something in the room is bound to be missing or out of order: the lights, the bedding, the ethernet connection or the television. On this stay, it was the ethernet connection and the cordless phone, which I could not answer, which the staff could not answer and which no one in the hotel could fix. I was traveling on business so imagine what it was like to have no phone or internet connection.I've had it with this place and would advise anyone traveling on business to avoid it. My office was nearby and that was enough to put up with the inexperienced, uncaring staff but no more. I'll stay somewhere else and take the tube before I stay here again."
275,1040,"Feb 19 2006	Great price 	I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza hotel for 2 nights in Feb, 2006 and found it to be a clean, comfortable quite reasonably-priced business-oriented hotel. This is not a cozy, charming English Inn--this is a modern business-oriented establishment which reaches for sleek, neon, fast-track ambience. Still, it's a bit of a find: the location near Victoria Station and some major London sites is great, the price is tough to beat (I paid 134 pounds before taxes) and there were quite nice amenities including a very good hot English breakfast buffet as well as use of the executive lounge, which offered free snacks, beer, wine, tea/coffee, newspapers, etc. For 12 pounds/day you can have unlimited high speed internet access in your room for your laptop (pack an ethernet cable). The front desk staff were mostly kids who appeared to be working their first hospitality industry jobs, but they were well-trained, friendly, professional and helpful. I'd stay here again for the convenience, amenities and price."
276,1040,"Feb 10 2006	exellect hotel in london	Stayed here in jan 2006,for a night,hotel was fab one of the best i stayed in london(and theres been a few).sevice was good and rooms were clean and large.The only down size was the hotel bar was on the dear side (even for london).just down the road from where billy elliot was showing,ideal for seeing a show.Would stay here again if going to london"
277,1040,"Feb 8 2006	5 Star Hotel At 3 Star Prices!	We made three trips to london last year and booked 3 rooms each time for family members. VICTORIA PARK PLAZA was simply the best value and very convenient for everything you will need in London: the rooms are immaculate and very quiet (this is london,and some hotels are noisy remember!) the breakfasts were outstanding and they are happy to cater for the fussiest of children, even lovely home-baked rolls. This hotel has the advantage of a warm swimming pool so even if its raining outside there is something to work off the breakfast! Staff were pleasant to all, even at the height of the tourist season in August. If you are looking for somewhere special at an ordinary price this is the hotel for you. Enjoy, we all did."
278,1040,"Feb 7 2006	Excellent!!!	Excellent!!! Stayed here for 2 nights. Very friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Rooms very clean and have everything you need including tea and coffee, we asked for more sugar and milk and with in 5 mins it arrived. Continental breakfast was great. Booked through Octopustravel.com got very good price for a 4 start London Hotel and had no problems. Hotel is close to everything you need Victoria Station 2 mins walk, Apollo Theatre 2 min walk and Wetherspoons Pub just up road. Would stay again."
279,1040,"Feb 6 2006	We recommend this hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel in January 2006.The location is first class, two minutes walk from Victoria railway/tube station.The staff are excellent, the rooms roomy and comfortable and the gymn well equipped. The restaurant was reasonably priced and to a very good standard. The staff produced excellent haggis on Burns Night.My wife has stayed there again since our trip and the same high quality service was experienced.The only minor negative point is the lack of a swimming pool.Easy, level walking to Westminster, Tate National, Buckingham Palace and many other sights. If you want a longer walk, stroll down to Parliament, then on to Westminster Bridge, cross the river (look out for fishing cormaorants and lost whales!), left past the London Eye, visit Tate Modern and meander along to Tower Bridge. Round the walk off with a visit to the Tower of London and then use the tube to get back.A highly recommended hotel."
280,1040,"Feb 2 2006	Just perfect!!	Having stayed in many London hotels that were more like shoeboxes, I was very surprised with the Victoria Park Plaza. It is located very close to the Victoria Station - literally a 2 minute walk - ideal for the Underground and links to Gatwick Airport. The rooms are standard American size with all conveniences, very comfortable bed, good sheets!, and nice furnishings. We were especially impressed with the bathroom - just beautiful, very modern, all glass. And be sure to look for the cool sculptures in the hotel lobby. Very fun! We didn't eat at the hotel, preferring the less-expensive pubs in the area, but we did have a drink at the hotel bar which was definately a drain on the wallet!! If I had to say one negative thing it would be that we requested a non-smoking room but our room had a faint aroma of cigarette smoke. Didn't spoil our trip at all though; we would definately stay here again."
281,1040,"Jan 31 2006 	Convenient Location - Nice Atmosphere	Not the most picturesque of locations being so near to Victoria Station, but great for transport, especially to anywhere in Central London. The Hotel has a very nice atmosphere in the bar and reception area and I have to say that on the few occasions my husband and I have stayed there on business (in the Executive Rooms), the Staff have been more than helpful. Don't forget to check the Government Rate, if you work in any Government Department, Schools, Universities etc, it is considerably lower. The rooms are larger and cleaner than most hotels that I have stayed at in London and the rooftop views on the 7th Floor, looking towards the London Eye and Houses of Parliament, are great, especially at night, when the buildings light up. The 'English Cooked Breakfast' could be hotter and the breakfast time extended, but generally okay. Be persistent, if what you get is not what you expected, tell them there and then don't wait until you leave. Choose a NEW HOTEL, I have decided that it is best to stay in newly developed hotels in London, as the majority are old buildings, with small dirty rooms and are extremely overpriced - this coming from a Londoner who LOVES the City."
282,1040,Jan 27 2006 	Service was awful	Stayed here several times over past few months thinking it should get better. they left a prawn sandwich in my room and a half eaten cream cake in the mini bar for 4 days. They overcharged me by 300 on checkout! I will never stay here again
283,1040,"Jan 9 2006	Easy	Spotless, modern and great location. My husband and I stayed at Victoria Park Plaza for 4 nights in December and had a fantastic time. The hotel is brand new so is very clean and modern. Breakfast is great. Very cheap deals on [--]"
284,1040,"Jan 9 2006	Great Stay	We just spent 5 nights here at the beginning of the year. This is one of the best deals I've ever found in London. The hotel was very modern, clean, friendly, and our room was very nice sized compared to other higher priced hotels. Just a great location being close to Victoria stations. Lots of nice restaurants near the hotel and we had an excellent dinner in the hotel restaurant. Our last two times in London we stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane, but this will now be our new &quot;favorite&quot; in London. Can't beat the value."
285,1040,"Jan 6 2006	Great Location	Stayed at this hotel for New Year 2004. The hotel is very well located - only 1 minute walk from Victoria tube and coach station. Sites such as Buckingham Palace were well within walking distance. The hotel itself is extremely clean and modern. The room was lovely - a good size and had everything you would need.The only downside was that, when we telephoned the hotel before hand, we were lead to believe that the hotel had a small number of free parking spaces, allocated on a first come first served basis. However this was not the case and we were charged 30 per night for valet parking (even though we had to park ourselves and were given no instructions as to where to go etc.) When we mentioned this to the staff they were fairly rude and unhelpful.I would probably stay here again if the room was offered for a good price!"
