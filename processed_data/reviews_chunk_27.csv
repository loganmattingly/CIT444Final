1,548,Oct 31 2009 	Dirty and undriendly	I stayed here for a few nights and regretted it. The room was dirty; the tv did not work and even more importantly the staff were the unfriendliest I have ever met. The female ;olich girl who works in the breakfast room could not crack a smile and did not know the meaning of customer service. Don't stay here - there are plenty of other hotels in Earls Court
2,548,"Oct 28 2009 	Convenient location @ affordable prices	We have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions over the last 14 years - yes its a budget hotel - but this is central London - what else do you expect for 85 per night for a double room including breakfast &amp; only 8 a day for parking? The Hotel is getting a little bit shabby admittedly but the bedding &amp; towels are clean, Ive never had a problem with a room and the breakfast is always enjoyable. I have no problem recommending this hotel to a friend (just not a posh one) &amp; as a little extra advice ask for room 19 or 21 just for that little bit of extra space ..."
3,548,"Jul 16 2009 	Quaint and cosy	The location of the Beaver Hotel cannot be beat. About 100m down the road is the Earls Court strip.. full of about 30 (INCREDIBLE) restaurants, definitely visit Masala Zone if you stay here, it is the best Indian on Earth I guarantee you! The tube station is also located about halfway down this strip, so anytime we needed to go anywhere, it was just a 100m walk and a tube ride away. Travel cost us about 20 the whole 8 days we were there (including getting to Heathrow and back!)The room itself was very basic.. very London, quaint and comfy though. Decent bed and bathroom, cant really complain for the price. Breakfast was funny, you could have a bit of bacon, a shriveled little sausage, eggs however you like them, and toast. They make it to order as you arrive in the dining room each morning. It was nice to have that kind of service instead of a germy buffet, and I have no complaints about hot food on a cold English morning! You could also take as many croissants and flavoured yoghurts as you like.Staff were friendly enough and helpful when we asked for directions. Another advantage is the massive Tesco directly across the road from the street the hotel is on. Plenty of variety and cheap snacks can be had from there.. just a shame we didnt have a kitchen to cook in, that would have been great.When it comes to my stay at the Beaver, I have only one regret: that I could only stay for one week. London is an incredible city and if I could afford to go back, I would jump on a plane this second :)"
4,548,"Jul 15 2009 	Excellent value for budget travel	The good: Earl's Court shops within 5 minutes walking, supermarket 5 minutes walking, quiet location. The bad: rooms are quite simple, so don't expect anything fancy. The breakfast was basic (they said full English, what we got was two pieces of toast, one piece of bacon, one sausage ;-) )"
5,548,Jul 13 2009 	Well located and very friendly	We stayed at the Beaver on a Saturday night in July. We drove into London and the hotel could not be easier to get to; it's just off the A4. They have a car park at the rear. All the staff were really friendly and helpful; the manager even came around the dining room during breakfast and said hello to everyone. The hotel is a short walk from Earls Court tube station which took us straight into Leicester Square. Room are a little old fashioned but everything was clean. We will definately stay here again on our next trip to London.
6,548,"Apr 10 2009 	Works well for London	As far as London hotels go, you need to fork over a lot of money for something nice. So for the 50 GBP we payed per night here it was alright. The walls were thin though. I only found that problematic in the morning when everyone is getting up and slamming their doors. We had to use the bathroom down the hall, but that wasn't as annoying as experience as I thought it would be. I have to say that the staff were all very nice. The wireless internet wouldn't work for us (our fault, not theirs) so without our even asking they ran a cable into the lounge and cleared a desk so we could just plug into the internet. Very thoughtful of them! It was definitely small, but manageable. Overall a good experience."
7,548,"Mar 15 2009 	As far as London hotels go no complainants!	The Beaver was clean, friendly, comfortable, and decently priced for London accommodation. We stayed in a 3 bedroom with bath and enjoyed our 4 day stay very much. The location is great, just a block away from the Earls Court tube stop. The breakfast was fantastic, very filling. After long days of sightseeing, it was a great place to come crash. A wonderful hotel for families, backpackers, and everyone in-between to take in London."
8,548,"Aug 28 2008 	We went anyway!!!	It was going to be a night out in London with my wife and bring the car instead of the a train ride. Did not look at any hotel forum prior to booking the Beaver Hotel. After reading the negative comments I was filled with trepidation. I had paid in advance so was committed.I judge a hotel by it's cleanliness and its plumbing. All I want is a clean bed and a hot shower, I got both.I'd read the reports on the breakfast so my expectations were fulfilled, It's all true what the say.We had stripped our bed at home and virtually brought it with us in the boot of the car along with my tool kit. Thankfully it all stayed in the car. 8 for the car parking is so small an amount as to be worthless, I think they could have given me that!!The building standards years ago were different to today. The plasterboard stud-walls offer no sound barrier therefore the hotel is noisy."
9,548,May 30 2008 	Not Recommended!	Booked this hotel back in Feb 2008 for a one night stay in May 2008. Got to the hotel and the receptionist had no record of our booking!! But told us that he had managed to find us a double room! we got to the room on the third floor and found it a bit of a mucky hole with stains on the carpet and a fusty smell to the room! They don't go over the top with breakfasts either!! Glad it was for only one night !!
10,548,"Apr 24 2008 	hotel from hell	After looking on their website, all looked ok, and we assumed at the price we paid it would meet some minimum standards - BUT oh dear!!! The initial room we were given on the first floor was small, stank and had dirty, tatty bedspreads, on further inspection of the mattresses we found them to be heavily stained with urine. We immediately complained to the man in reception, who apologized profusely and offered us a better room on the ground floor - room number 27. This room was slightly bigger (and I mean slight), but once again, old,shabby furnishings and decor, smelled of smoke, looked unlaundered and lo and behold on inspection of the mattresses we found them to be equally as bad as our first room.Money had already been taken from my account for the first night and we were eager to get on with our short visit to London and get out of the hotel, so it seemed pointless complaining again as this seemed to be one of their 'better' rooms in an old, shabby hotel - so we decided to grin and bear it, with the help of a large amount of alcohol we managed to sleep on top of the beds with the bedspreads removed and to show what a classy joint it was, the bathroom didn't even have a toilet roll holder, the roll was on the floor (no expense spared obviously).For some reason our beds were not made the next day? Laughing about it now, but I would not wish my worse enemy a stay in a hotel like this. Looking forward to the full English breakfast, my mouth dropped open at being presented with one small skinny sausage and one thin slice of bacon - which England did this breakfast come from???"
11,548,Mar 5 2008 	what a dirty hole	well i went down london with my brother on a spare of the moment thing and we got off the bus at victoria station and it was evening so we didnt want to look round for a hotel all night so we went to hotels stop at station and they suggested the beaver hotel at 60 english pound for a twin room so i thought it must be ok 60 quid got given a peice of paper as our booking form and payed 60 quid there and then whenm we got to earls court it took a while to find it and when we did well what a sight but we payed so we went in got one key card between 2 of us i asked if we could have another one and he said i dont know where it is i think the last people in the room took it so straight away i asked so someone could get in to the room with the lost key he said no it will be ok i will find it so we payed the other 60 pound for the other night and went to the room up the stairs went in the room and it was a thin walk way with a sink and 2 dirty looking beds with stains all over the floor white and brown dont ask me what they was i would not like to know but i was not gonna let it ruin my weekend i slept on top of the covers in some jeans and t-shirt got up next day for brekkie went down sat sown said full english and got a tiny peice of bacon a mini sausage and scrambled egg and toast well i went to mc donalds it was crap i plea to people DO NOT STAY THERE ITS A DIRTY HOLE
12,548,Feb 26 2008	Great Value Hotel/B 	The Beaver Hotel in Earls Court is really good value for London at 85 per room including a small but adequate English breakfast.It is very clean and the staff are really friendly. We would have liked to see a Tea/Coffee tray in the room but there is a 24 hour Tesco a very short walk from the hotel.We walked there to get a drink after a concert at Earls Court which is an equally short walk from the Beaver in the opposite direction. If you want a basic clean comfortable hotel/B &amp; B at a reasonable price then you can't really go wrong at the Beaver Hotel.
13,548,"Feb 10 2008 	There's something better than stay here	After looking really last minute for a nice B&amp;B a friend recommended us the Beaver with the words &quot;I liked it&quot;. So ist was a spontanous decision, particulary all other hotels were already full booked. First I have to say: the website looks better than in reality.If you have no requirements than the Beaver is enough for you. Having a adress for getting a little sleep, a warm shower and a unpretentious breakfast - than it will be enogh. Otherwise: no way.The rooms and the bathroom are small but tidy if you oversight the dirty cutains, the nasty carpet and coverlets and the need of renovation (especially in the bathroom).Our triple room was in the ground floor opposite the reception. Not hearing anything form there or the stairway but extremly from the obove room. We could sing every song of MTV music clips listening to the TV from above. But after a complaint at the reception it was tolerable, though with earplugs. But getting restorable sleep in those beds feeling every spring of the mattress was impossible.The breakfast includes tea or coffee, cornflakes/muesli with milk or yoghurt (great choice of different flavours in packages), toast with light salted butter and two sorts of marmelade. If you want you can get two eggs in any form (boiled, scrambled or fried) or sausages and ham. They even have a choice of fruits: apples and tangerines! - If you are not an athlet or a greedy pig it will be enough and it is good enough for a breakfast.The personal was very friendly and really helpful and the calm location next to the Underground &quot;Earls Court&quot; for being in the city center in about 10 minutes is the only advantage. Unfortunatley these facts do not balance the uncomfortable beds and comfortless, loveless atmosphere."
14,548,Sep 6 2007 	Clean but pricey	The staff are very friendly at the Beaver hotel but the cost of staying here was too much.We stayed in a double en-suite room which was nice. The room was quite spacey and so was the bathroom.We had no problems at all with the room - though the hairdryer didn't work in the bathroom.All in all - I would recommend this hotel if you were only staying for one night as it is expensive.
15,548,"May 13 2007 	Pretty Decent	I found this place pretty decent. Through lastminute.com it was 30 pounds a night for a non-ensuite single, which i think is about as cheap as you can get this in London for. I found my bed comfortable and the room clean. The window opened fine and you could get a lot of air. My room had no tv but I would respond to others' comments that if your hotel room tv in England is not cable, it will generally only get about 3 channels. The sausage at each day's breakfast tasted slightly funny to me. Yogurts and fruit are self-service at breakfast so you could just about have 2 if you wanted- I enjoyed having 2 yogurts one day. There is a gigantic supermarket about 6 or 7 minutes walk away- Tescos. It is a LONG walk from the tube, especially if you want to come out of tube on the Earls Court Road exit, and you will notice the walk if you're lugging heavy luggage or running late (or both). If you suffer from hay fever (I don't) you will pass a ton of trees on way to hotel (I did swallow a lot of pollen running to make plane my last day and was coughing like mad for about 15 minutes). There are a lot of hotels you'll pass on the way from the tube that are closer, one of which (Great Northern something I think) had the same price rooms (temporarily) posted out front as Beaver cost me. There was 1 receptionist, a pregnant woman, who seemed to get very slightly hysterical no matter what I asked her and another receptionist, a young man, who was always on the phone, especially at night, so I didnt feel comfortable interrupting to ask non-urgent questions, and one very nice and professional middle-aged woman receptionist. I was on the 2nd floor (American use 3rd), the lift always worked with practically no wait. Room phone was very good, you could phone London numbers with no surcharges at all, costing the same or less as a payphone would, phone books were in my bottom desk drawer. There was never any wait for the loo down the hall. I should mention there was some kind of rumbling noise most mornings at roughly the same hours breakfast was served, 7am to 9am, which made it a bit hard to sleep for me. In terms of people talking and doors banging I found this a very quiet hotel, which I valued highly. If you have a choice of rooms, see if there is a banging fire door nearby- I had a choice between 2 rooms (I asked) and was able to avoid the banging fire door near rooms 14 and 15 on 2nd floor, by taking room 15."
16,548,"Feb 14 2007 	Smokey	We booked the hotel through last minute.com. We didn't pay much but we got the rank smoking room on the top floor-which stank even though we left the windows open all weekend. The bedding also smelt of smoke and so did we by default. The beds were really uncomfy. Didn't bother with breakfast, based on our room we doubted it would be up to much. As we were checking out we walked past a room with an open door-it looked lovely, normal room unlike our hideous one! Likely to have been because we booked through last min so check you are not getting the smoking rooms if you are going. even if you are a smoker-they're AWFUL."
17,548,"Nov 26 2006 	Ruined our weekend	Awful! On arrival the hotel looked grubby compared to others we had passed. The reception was dowdy and gloomy with an ugly reception counter with sliding glass. We were given a room on the 3rd floor which smelt damp and mouldy. The carpet was wet by the bathroom. No tea/coffee making facilities. The bed linen, especially the pillows were grubby. The radiator and walls were dirty and splattered. The shower was set too low (I'm not tall) and barely trickled. The lounge/dining room area when we returned from the show was full of employees smoking. We took drinks to our room. We were woken at 5.00 am by employees laughing, joking and banging around. The breakfast was NOT an English breakfast. Small (the size of my little finger) sausage, ham/bacon? two eggs and quarter of tomato. When we checked out we were 'disturbing' the receptionist speaking french, and no questionnaire was offered. We have stayed in some very poor countries and never experienced anything like it! It really ruined our weekend visit to see a show."
18,548,"Oct 16 2006 	Typical for London	This is what I would consider a typical B&amp;B/hotel for London. Smaller rooms and smaller beds compared to US hotels, but adequate. Breakfast was a couple of eggs, a piece of bacon, a piece of sausage, toast, coffee or tea, and was enough to get you started in the morning. Staff was very friendly. Only a few TV stations. 5-10 minute walk to Earls Court subway station.Just a word of caution though...the elevator. It has a posted weight limit of 630kgs (about 1300 pounds), but I don't think that is very accurate since the 5 of us don't weigh anywhere near that much and we &quot;broke&quot; it one morning heading back from breakfast. We were all stuck in the elevator for about 10 minutes while the staff turned off part of the power to the elevator (but thankfully not the lights inside) and tried to find the key to open the door. We were still at the basement level when this occurred, so it was nothing major, but I don't think I would have liked it at any other floor."
19,548,"Aug 7 2006 	its a hostel	I booked this hotel because it was an average price for london and near where my relatives were staying for the trip. Had I known what terrible room conditions and unfriendly staff this hotel had, I would never have stayed here. Room was very small, bedding was old and pillows looked very dirty. rust around bathtub. It was hot in london and when I asked for a fan to help with the unventilated room I was told that all fans had gone out to other quests. I asked for a fan every day--for 3 dyas and I was always told &quot;no.&quot; television is tiny tiny with only 3 stations.Not worth your money."
20,548,"May 22 2006	If you like cigarette burns...	...you'll love this hotel. Everything in our room had at least 2 cigarette burns, including our blankets and sheets. The room was dirty and I did not want to unpack a single item from my luggage. In fact, I felt like i had to remove my comforter with gloves because I didn't know what was on it. I am not one to worry about the decorating in a hotel; however, the pepto bismol pink wall color made me slightly nauseous. The bathroom shower was growing things. The hotel staff (including the owner) were EXTREMELY unhelpful. They couldn't even tell us the best underground station to use when going to the London Eye. Overall, we felt extremely uncomfortable in this hotel."
21,548,"Apr 7 2006	Good value hotel in great location	We stayed at the Beaver Hotel for several days in early April. The room was clean and adequate and I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends.Pros: 1) Excellent location near Earl's Court Tube.2) The price was good for London at only 55 pounds per night including breakfast.3) The staff were very helpful and friendly (for the most part - see &quot;Cons&quot; below).4) We had no problems with our reservations or payment.Cons: 1) The full English breakfast was the worst I've ever had in London, but again, adequate.2) We accidentally rang the doorbell after 11pm one night as we were coming in and the man who had checked us in earlier that day - and who had been very personable - turned into a bit of a Psycho and was visibly very upset with us making the noise - even after we explained that it was an accident. (We avoided him from then on.)3) No tea-making facilities in the rooms (but it is available until midnight in the basement).Overall, a good, relatively cheap place to stay in a city where you can sometimes pay a lot for downright scary, dirty rooms."
22,548,"Jan 31 2006 	The Beaver did not disappoint!	I wanted a cheap and clean hotel near to Earls Court tube and the famous Troubadour cafe and music club on the Old Brompton Road. The Beaver did not disappoint,My room was basic but quite comfortable. The staff were helpful and the breakfast room welcoming, with newspapers available. The food was fine.I would definitely recommend this hotel though it needs some internal re-decoration and should do itself justice by adopting a more attractive name."
23,548,"Dec 23 2005	Great Hotel Good Value	There were 3 of us girls in a triple room on the ground floor and our room was ready when we arrived at noon. The room was very spacious with 3 single beds. There was some storage for your clothes but if you're staying for more than a couple of days, you may as well leave your clothes in your suitcase as there isn't a great deal of storage space.We were given two keys (cards) which operated the front door as well as the door to our room, so no problem with coming back late.The beds were a little hard and we had to ask for extra pillows but this wasn't a problem at all. The top bed-spreads were a little stained but the sheets and pillowcases were immaculately clean.The room had a TV and the channels all worked fine.The bathroom was a decent size and was very clean. There was a bath/shower and the shower was very powerful - just what you need after walking around London all day! There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom but it wasn't very powerful so best to take your own. There are complimantary toiletries and ample supply of towels.Room was cleaned and beds made every day.Breakfast consisted of cereal, cooked breakfast (not very big but consisted of egg - scrambled, fried or poached - sausage, bacon and tomato), as much toast as you want with butter, jam and marmalade, tea or coffee, yoghurt and fruit. It might not look like a lot but when you add it all together it's very filling and sets you up for the day nicely. Breakfast is served in the dining room in the basement where there is also tea and coffee available up until midnight.There is no bar but there is a vending machine which has cans of beer, lager, small bottles of spirits and another which has canned soft drinks.All of the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially the lady on reception.The location of the hotel is ideal. Only a 5 minute walk from Earls Court tube station. It is on a lovely tree-lined street and we felt very safe walking back there late at night. The hotel also has a large car park at the rear (which we didn't need to use as we didn't travel by car). The fee for parking in the hotel car park is paid upfront and you put a sticker on your windscreen. It's ideal to have this car park in this part of London where parking is at a premium.Overall, we were very pleased with our choice of hotel and would highly recommend it to others. It only cost us 180 for the three of us for 2 nights during Christmas week. Very good value for money.We are already planning on returning there next year, maybe for a West End show."
24,548,"Jul 28 2005	What I expected	Having lived and worked at a hotel a few doors down from this hotel over a decade ago I did not expect much, and I was right, the room was as small as I remembered the rooms from the other hotel. I had a single ensuite and it suited me fine for 2 days as I was hardly there. I had to go out as the room was so HOT and I couldn't open any windows, that's my only major complaint. The room smelt quite musty but that must be the norm in those type of buildings, the previously mentioned hotel smelt the same, and the fact the windows don't open wouldn't help. The breakfast was fine and at least it was included in the exhorbitant (but normal London) room rate. I wouldn't expect much more from a budget hotel in London."
25,548,"Jul 13 2005	OK if you don't have too high expectations	I had read these reviews and booked a room with no private facilities for three nights and then again following week for eight nights. I wouldn't have done that if I knew there are no showers in the common bathroom! The idea of waiting the bath to be ready and someone knocking impatiently on the door was so unpleasant I changed for an ensuite room (it was ok, they had that kind of rooms available). I must say I felt quite uneasy to pay 54 pounds a night for such a small, simple room. But what can you do? The problem is not Beaver Hotel, the problem is the standard and rates London hotels in general. I spent a couple of hours in an internet cafe trying desperately to find a cheaper alternative with the standard (never non-ensuites again) but didn't make it.There is no reason for you to avoid this particular hotel if you have decided to come to London and not sleep in a dormitory or something. The rooms are small and simple but clean (the plankets and the wallpaper in the room were quite spotty and therefore ugly, though), the Earls Court area is ok and this particular street is quiet. In my opinion the breakfast was good (eggs and becon and toast, but also yoghurts and fruits). The staff is nice and helpful. There is a comfortable lounge to use and free tea available. In my first room the television didn't work, but in the second one it did. The shower worked as well as they ever do in England. The second time I must have had the same room as the previous writer - for some reason, no toilet paper holder! I don't know if you appreciate this little detail or not but in the breakfast room there was old posters with pictures on Earls court area. As a friend of local history I liked them."
26,548,"May 1 2005	Pretty good value for money	I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights in April. I had a single ensuite room for 54/night. The location of the hotel is good near the underground and in a walking distance to many shops, restaurants, museums and parks. The staff was friendly and spoke good English. The room was tidy and the size was OK. The bed was a bit on the hard side and there was some street noise but these things didnt affect my beauty sleep. The bathroom was clean and the shower was OK. For some reason there was no holder for the toilet paper roll. The breakfast was monotonous (mainly bacon, eggs, tiny sausages and toast) but it was included in the room price. All in all pretty good value for money."
27,548,"Nov 14 2004	Liked it very much	I stayed at the Beaver Hotel last month for 4 nights. Its a nice hotel, 5 minutes walk from Earls Court underground and the shops on Earls Court Road.I had a single basic room, which was small but very clean and value for money. Shared en-suite facilities for the basic room were nice.Breakfast was served downstairs, staff were very efficent and friendly.There is a small lounge area with Satellite tv, nice to chill out there after a long day shopping!Am alread planning another stay here in January."
28,548,"Mar 16 2004	Reasonable and a great value.	Hotel Beaver is in one of those converted Victorian-style houses in Kensington &amp; Chelsea. It's just a stone's throw from a central Underground station (Earls Court), and a block from various shopping, services, and restaurants on Earls Court Road. Very convenient location, especially for the price. The single room I had was pretty small, but had television, en-suite facilities, and a phone. Don't show up with a lot of luggage unless you get a bigger room! I'd definitely stay here again."
29,548,"Dec 15 2003	Basic but adequate.	Very affordable accommodation, albeit having fairly basic rooms. Telephone and all the other commodities were supplied, although the reception on the television was aweful. The most important thing about the rooms, which overcomes their basic qualities was the fact that they were perfectly clean.Services within the hotel were good, breakfast was avalible in a nice dining room on the sub-floor. Staff were very nice and helpful, overall a nice place to stay if you don't mind the simplicity."
30,548,"Nov 19 2003	Quite reasonable	Safty enough. Room are relatively small. Facilities are common, but clean. Free for tea or coffee. Breakfast is not bad. Reasonable price (38 GBP)I would recommend this pretty small hotel to young travellers."

1,552,Jul 31 2009 	OK for 1 night	Our family of 4 stayed at the Astoria for 1 night on July 16th. The reception was very polite and there were no problems with the reservation. We had booked a room for 4 and that is just what we got. The check-in is at 11:00 and we showed up about 12:30 and the room was not ready. We just left our bags and came back 1/2 hour later and it was ready. Going into this hotel we expected very little for the price and that is what we got but the room was clean and the shower worked great. Make sure you pack shampoo because they only supply a small bar of soap. The breakfast was served next door in the basement of the Belmont and it was suprisingly good. It would have cost our family of 4 close to 25 pounds to eat out but this was included in the 95 pound rate we booked through EasyToBook.com. The checkout was at 11:00 a.m. also but the reception allowed us to leave our bags so we could spend the day in London w/o lugging them around. The location is only about 3 blocks from Paddington train staion and tube which is great. There are plenty of places to eat w/in waking distance and the Cad bar just around the corner has probably the least expensive drinks in London. I would sugest that if you stay more than 1 night to find something better but for 1 night it works fine.
2,552,"Jul 30 2009 	WORST hotel EVER!!!!!	MAYBE IT'S A LONG DESCRIPTION, BUT PLEASE READ IT! THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!The room was older then me. Needs a totally makeover. the curtains stays to fall. the double bed is one a half close to the wall so you won't fall off or because the room is so small. the ancient doors reminds me of the comunist east. the windows hardly open and they are also as old as the room is. the view is 3 1/2 walls and nothing else. the windows were not washed since the falling of the Berlin wall seams like. the furniture is falling apart, so i was afraid to use it. there was a water cooker and some coffe and milk, but the cooker was never cleaned inside i guess. and the 2 cups on the table you can still see the rest of the previous lipstick or coffe in it. the tv was small and dark, maybe because the dust is everywhere or because of the smoke before the smokink law. anyway, the only 5 chanels it's enough if you manage to switch on, because the remote control was broken and taped with tape so it bearly hold togeter. we got no shampoo, no shower gel, just 2 small pieces of soap of the lowest quality possible. we asked for shampoo, they dont have it. The bathroom was very small, you bearly manage to sit on the toilet seat because the sink it's right onto it. and the shower curtain is old and almost rotten. you can also see rust on the floor and door. well that was the room.The included breakfast it's no more then english breakfast wich is served along with a very small glass of orange juice and 4 toast for two . try and ask for more. the RUDE personell working there might give you more, but not be pleased that you asked for more. you can get coffer but only if you are there in time, half an hour before closing they stop cooking coffe so you might not get one. the cereals are on a table and nothing else. you get butter and the same 3 kinds of jam every day. i want to repeat myself so you can get the picture: The personell working in the breakfast room are RUDE! they don't smile, bearly say good morning or speak properly english, they get almost angry if you ask for something more or else to variate. They start cleaning the tables and remove the plates while you are still eating or holding your toast. maybe because right away they start cleaning the room and running to the next hotel? cleaning the room: you are asked to leave the room so they cand clean, they DON'T came again later. and about cleanig: they just fill for coffe and milk and arrange the bed. they dont change the sheets every day. we got new sheets because i insisted after 3 night. The ONLY positive thing was the all-right-one-smile personell at the reception. but no, they didn't have a map of the city and one evening at 9 pm we had to wait 10 min outside because it was closed. and this is a 24 hours reception hotel.All in all: expensive, dirty, rude stuff, no internet, not so great area and not good breakfast!"
3,552,"Feb 22 2009 	Pay some extra pounds and choose a other hotel	Very small room. Sleep 4 nights on same sheets, get clean towles not until ask, twice. If you like bacon and beans.......after all don't choose this hotel. Pay some extra pounds and choose a other hotel"
4,552,"Sep 7 2008	Sneaky	I reserved a double room through an agent called Terry! He said that our room is in Belmont ,when i asked about Astoria he said he has nothing to do with it ,though i found that belmont &amp; Astoria are the same chain . to start reservation Mr. Jerry deducted 35 pounds of my credit card as a deposit!!!!!!!!!!!!I went to check the hotel ,ifound that our reservation was in Astoria Not in Belmont contradicting what mr.Jerry said. We did not like the room as it was too small ,the bathroom was tooooooooooooo small ,so we informed the receptionist to cancel our reservation{he never did} .$8 hours before checking in we sent an email to the hotel &amp; to Mr. Jerry to confirm cancellation.STRANGE ENOUGH : the hotel denied receiving the mail ,&amp; we found out that they deducted 59 pounds from our credit card claiming that we did not show up nor did we cancel!!!!!!!!!!!The agent denied taking the 35 pounds for himself &amp;said the hotel got them!!!!!!!!the hotel said it is Jerry who got the 35 pounds It ended up that we lost 94 pounds between unprofessional sneaky people.It was a very bad experience &amp; an unfair way to snatch such amount of money for nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1I have my mails to verify the incident"
5,552,"Jul 5 2008	Portaloo!!!	This hotel looked lovely on the outside, however when you get inside you are greeted by rather miserable looking staff who dont speak much and they dont even show you to your room. Upon entering the room after climbing a very narrow set of stairs, i was shocked to find the room so small that me and my mum could barely move, then there was the bathroom or lack of it i should say, it was the size of a small cupboard, i have seen portaloo's that are bigger, so if you are of a rather large stature i would avoid this place. Noisy, not very well decorated and tiny."
6,552,"Jun 22 2008 	Nice staff serving breakfast really friendly people	My experience was generally good, rooms were clean, clean toilets sheets and towells, there was a cleaner keeping the room clean and tidy every day, the breakfast was reall nice, and the staff was really friendly.I dont know if the rooms in Belmont building are diferent, but I went to the astoria, allthough the main reception and breakfast was served in the belmont (its the next door if you are in the astoria). The only reason I am not rating as an excelent is because of the receptionist that received me and my friends, the only staff member that wasnt friendly at all."
7,552,"May 6 2008	disgusted anglesey	stayed in the belmont part of this hotel , the photos for this must be from the astoria or another hotel. we booked for our visit to the hyde park calling concert. would rather have camped out in the park in the pouring rain. tiny rooms musty smell, with very narrow stairs leading down to the cellar I think!! when we woke in the morning hundreds of ants crawling all over the place coming in from a hole by the door and walking along the dado rail, did pass a comment to the staff but were not interested. couldn't get out of there fast enough. never again!!"
8,552,"Nov 15 2007	Appalling	I booked for one,received a quad room. Musty smell, Carpet certainly not clean would not be safe to walk on in bare feet.Shower tiny, ceiling covered in black spots over shower, power weak,just one tiny bar of &quot;Soap&quot; despite saying toiletries are provided. Hair dryer had to be collected at reception. This room was 50 steps up a narrow stairway next to attic. No assistance offered to bring case up or down. Sheets were white but I woke up &quot;itching&quot; Reception area had t.v. but couches had torn seating. Could not face breakfast having had a sleepless few hours. Certainly would not recommend this to anyone. This building should be checked for Health and Safety."
9,552,"Sep 16 2007 	Not worth it	Way to expensive for this standard. The bathroom looked like a rebuilt oil drum smacked into a corner of a very small room. On the positive side of things, the staff was very nice, I'd reccommend them any day. :)Also, hotels.com did not give accurate information on the hotel, seeing as they promised us free broadband connection. We could get broadband connection, but at a price of 5 a day.It might just be that we are not used to the english hotel standard, but I was absolutely expecting higher standard in a three star hotel."
10,552,"Jul 6 2007 	Clean and comfortable	The location can't be beaten, within walking distance of Paddington Station and Hyde Park. Front desk is open 24 hours which helped when we checked in at midnight. We stayed in the Astoria which two doors away from the Belmont. Our quad had a small bath en suite. Room was clean and tidy. Tea and coffee provided in the room. Breakfast is served in the Belmont and was proper English fare. Room had little character and no pictures on the wall which was not important but noticible. Staff was helpful and friendly and very nice to our young children. I would return to this hotel"
11,552,"Jun 4 2007 	Good location	We were here for a one-night stay in June. This hotel is in a good location about 2 blocks from Paddington Station. The room was small (but not the smallest we have stayed at in London). However, the configuration of the furniture made it very difficult to find a place to put 2 small/medium suitcases where you could open them. The suitcases would either be where you wanted to walk or in front of the door. The room was clean and the bed fairly comfortable. There was a hot pot with tea bags and instant coffee in the room. We were in a ground floor room near the reception so it was a little noisy, but not too bad. Unfortunately the windows to the room did not open so it was a little stuffy but fine since we were so tired from our day. If it were very warm out, it would have been uncomfortable. Full English breakfast (sausage, ham, egg, beans, toast, coffee/tea, and juice) were included in the price and it was pretty good. They serve breakfast downstairs which keeps some of the noise away from the rooms. All of the staff were very nice and friendly. This is a fine hotel for a short stay, but may not be comfortable for a longer stay. But, the price was very reasonable for London (70 pounds per night) and for being so close to the metro."
12,552,"Apr 30 2007 	Don't go there!	This hotel is not at all as the photos from the website and from the internet! They have very small horrible rooms, with VERY narrow stairs, and the windows can't be opened! The furniture looks as from the communist schools, and believe me i know what i am talking about, because i am from an ex-communist country! They have no fridgeas they say, no mirror as in the photos, the tv was not working, no towels when we checked in (we had a horible twin in the top of the building) and the guy from the reception charged me before seeing the room! Then he told is not his fault they are not towels, and the photos are different! He promised to give us another room,which he never did,and when i was asking him why happens all this,he simply played he doesn't hear! Finally, he changed the tv with one which was working.The only quality this hotel has was the position and that it was clean. Sussex Gardens street is full with hotels, so choose another. They are planty of them, all loooking better."

1,553,May 15 2008	Wow pretty bad.	I'm not fussy when it comes to hotels but this was falling apart. The bathroom was horrid. Staff were fine. The front door just kept continually beeping and I don't know why. I needed to be in this area at the time and it was dirt cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. Somewhere to rest my head....that's it!
2,553,Aug 28 2007 	The worst place Ive seen in my life	I cant describe this hotel. Is like a terror movie.Everything is horrible...Dont do this!Except youd like to record a trash movie in a good vicinty!
3,553,"Jul 27 2007	Stinking place!!	YUK!! You cant call this a hotell! It was a stinking, crappy and a dirty hole. Had booked for 3 days but we leaved immidiately. We stayed at the Arriva Hotel in Swinton instead, MUCH BETTER!!!"
4,553,"Jul 24 2007 	Avoid This Hotel at All Costs!	This hotel may only have 1 star but it is 1 star too many! It is absolutely the worst hotel I have ever seen. I had booked to stay there for 1 night, but after seeing the room I had to leave, I couldn't stay, not even for 1 night even though I didn't have another hotel at the time. Sleeping in my car was a far better prospect that staying at the Belsize Park hotel from hell!!!The rooms are supposed to be a basic standard, the room I was shown was far below basic, it was disgustingly filthy! Don't stay there!!!!!!"
5,553,"Jul 14 2007 	Great situation awful hotel!	While this hotel is undoubtably in a wonderful location, close to the tube and on a road containing more than one Aston Marton, the place itself is a dive.Our bathroom had a sink which was too small even for brushing your teeth, a shower which had been sealed incredibly badly and seemingly patched up (which would explain the huge damp patches and mould on the ceiling in various points throughout the hotel). Oh and the toilet seat wouldn't stay up!!The room itself had &quot;curtains&quot; which were full of holes and falling off the hooks, letting so much light in we couldn't sleep. They genuinely looked moth-eaten. Our blanket was full of cigarette burns and the whole room stank of damp.To add insult to injury, my husband decided to watch TV while I was in the shower. Yes, there was a TV as we had been told BUT the aerial plug was missing from the end of its cable, having been seemingly pulled off exposing bare wires. This added to the other bare wires and dodgy DIY fix jobs we saw elsewhere in the place.We had to wait around 15 or 20 minutes in a queue for breakfast, and then I had to wait another 10 minutes or so for my toast. My husband tells me the fried breakfast was the only good thing about the hotel and was fairly enjoyable!!We didn't sleep well during our stay and were glad to leave!"
6,553,"Jun 8 2007 	bareable for the price	Well for the price paid this was a fairly standard hotel, it was a little taty in places but our room was ok, the bed was fine and the building was quite grand, just in need of some tlc.The area was very nice and it was close to a tube station, about what you would expect for this price in London.If you are delicate about your surroundings then perhaps not for you but about the standard you would expect from an older hostel. Bareable really."
7,553,"Apr 23 2007	Don't know what all the fuss is about!! Perfectly aceptable	I stayed here with a few friends from Uni at the beginning of April. 10th and 11th and I found it to be good value for money. OK its not the Ritz but what can you expect for the Money particularly given that breakfast was included in the price. Its also located in a really nice park of London. Which is unusual as most budget Hotels tend to be located in less affluent areas. Anyway, i would stay here again. Its clean, ok its basic but its worth more than I paid any day."
8,553,"Nov 17 2006 	disgusting	As you can see in the candid photo, it's just a broken house with rooms for travellers. The reception counter is just a small table. There were painting dropping off from the wall in the reception area. You can see electric cables coming out from the wall. There were nothing in the room except your bed, an old TV and a broken wardrobe. There was only 2 soaps provided in the toilet. The breakfast was cold and no one was going to refill if the trays were empty. The tea was cold as well. The staff were not friendly. I just felt like being in a haunted house there."
9,553,"Nov 3 2006 	Unclean unprofessional and not worth a penny	Actually didn't end up staying there, made a booking, turned up, some crisis going on at the reception with someone else who had booked a room and no booking found. We were shown the room, changed our minds very quickly as was disgusting, filthy carpet, bedlinen, a box room, not to mention the dirty shower !!!Don't consider, if you want cheap find a hostel."
10,553,"Oct 19 2006 	DISGUSTING!!!!!!! Don't do it! There are better places to go!	It was genuinely disgusting even for cheap london standards! The room we got was dirty with all kinds of dubious stains! Dirty linens. Holes in the bed, the floors, seriously dodgy English Amateur DIY jobs in the kitchen. Rusty refrigerator. Curtains that did not close at all so the posh neighbors could have a free floorshow ! The stains on the walls and floors were...okay...I think they look like someone's menstrual blood! I'm sorry, this is gross but I am telling it how it is, so much so that I don't even want to put the photos up as it is gross! Don't do it! For your sanity! When I stayed for all of 4hrs in the room before I ran for another hotel, I just bursted out crying from seeing how disgusting the room was. The old man at the frontdesk tried to be helpful (and he was sweet) and tried to give us another room, but it was just as bad! We saw 4 rooms in all..it was all really disgusting!"
11,553,"Oct 3 2006 	Belzise Park Hotel was very good value for money	Excellent - Got a quad room, which they specially organised for us, (usualy quad rooms have 2 double beds, and 4 lads dont want that!) Rooms were simple, but adequet for us as we just wanted a base camp to rest in while we went around Camden (a short busride away). The breakfast was very good, good quality self service full english with tea, cofee and orange juice. Between 4 of us it was 17.25 a night, and for anywhere that is extremely good value, never mind London. Very good value for money."
12,553,"Sep 22 2006 	Yuk Yuk YUK	Horrible - we reserved two triples for a group and one room was filled with flying insects due to an open window. The other room had dirty linens, including a used condom in the bed... needless to say we left after the first night and found other accomodations nearby."
13,553,"Sep 21 2006 	Avoid this hotel like the plague	Avoid this hotel like the plague. Run down - there were holes in the stairs on the way to the upper floor on which I stayed, the curtain on the windows was too small to cover the area, there were disgusting stains on the carpet, hairs on the bath (bathroom and bedroom were very spacious for London), no bedside lamp, no tea/coffee facilities, television only had one channel and was snowy. very very basic pay the extra and get somewhere decent."
14,553,"Aug 29 2006 	All you need from a hotel (except new furniture)	We stayed in a double at the Belsize Park Hotel during the Bank Holiday weekend and found it altogether appropriate for the price. At 43/night for the double room and a location in Zone 2 North West London, this is a decent budget hotel.It looks like some decoration work was going on during our stay, with a few carpets having been taken off the stairs and a smell of paint all over the corridors. The interior of the hotel is reasonably old with torn/stained carpets and shabby furniture. The room was basic, with no view (actually it looked onto another window in the alleyway), no TV, phone and not even the &quot;tea making facilities&quot; so loved by the English. However, the ensuite bathroom was clean, the shower was warm and had good pressure and the bed was comfy. So altogether: an ugly room which performed all of its basic functions perfectly.The staff were all absolutely lovely, smiled a lot, were ready to chat and kept our bags safe when we turned up too early for check-in. The 2 most surprising good points (and turners for my review) were these:- Room Service. I wasn't expecting any, but while we were out the staff made our beds and brought fresh towels.- The Breakfast! Even though we turned up way late for breakfast on the Sunday (I'm sure they told me a different time....), we were immediately offered cooked breakfast. It's nothing spectacular (vegetarians get beans and scrambled egg), but still a surprise at that budget! They also have cornflakes and toast with butter, margarine, jam and honey.All in all, I would be happy to stay at the Belsize Park Hotel again when on a tight budget."

1,555,Nov 21 2009	Good Location	closed to bayswater underground. easy to find halal food.
2,555,"Nov 21 2009 	Quick Overview	Location is good, but transportation with underground from Victoria station is not so fast. Room is not very small, but there is not enough free space for two people. Bathroom is extreme cold and tiny. Stuff are Ok."
3,555,"Nov 15 2009 	good location but not recommended	The location is very good being only 5 min walk from 2 tubes and 10 min into the city centre....... unfortunately thats the only good thing about it, the rooms are very dated and ridiculously small, the bathroom in particular where its a struggle to even fit into the shower, the wash basin isn't big enough to wash your hands and when brushing your teeth you basically have to leave the door open in order to fit in. The whole place feels very closterphobic, with tiny lifts and seriously narrow corridors, even in the middle of november and with the window open fully all day and night the room was still sickeningly hot, as for the hotel services the breakfast was only ok and even though its included in the price of the room hot breakfast's are extra. We stayed for 3 nights but our room was only serviced/cleaned on the last evening only because we had requested it to be done...... twice. Overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone"
4,555,"Nov 14 2009 	Great location small rooms	The location was great. We could walk to the tube in less than 2 minutes. There were plenty of small stores, gift shops, restaurants, pubs, and fast food places just around the corner. The price was very affordable too. The rooms were very small though. The hallways were tight and only 2 people could fit in the lift. The lift didn't always work either. I got lost using the stairs. The hotel seems to be a bunch of old row houses put together. It is like a little maze. Our first room had a shower that I could not fit in. It was very uncomfortable. I asked to have my room changed and the new room was much better. Also, the toilets didn't flush that well. I asked the manager if they could have some vegan food available for us in the restaurant for breakfast. He said that he would. The first morning they had nothing but toast. We asked him again later that day and he said they would have soy milk for us the next morning and that the fruit they provided was vegan. The next morning came and they had no soy milk. The fruit looked like it came out of a can. I think the price for the breakfast is not worth it anyway. Go out for breakfast. You'll do better. Also, there is a great panini shop around the corner. Get an iced tea there. It is the only place that seems to have them."
5,555,"Oct 20 2009 	Great Value for money!! Staying again next year!!	We stayed here for two nights at the start of the trip and couldnt believe the location, wow its amazing its a short walk to the tube, parks,and internet access. We found the serivce accommodating, and helpful. The hall ways are a little narrow and long, but the rooms are newly renovated( ours was). The room was clean, comfortable, and the bathroom was lovely!. There was a litlle noise outside in the evening, but when u have been travelling for ages you become quite exhusted quickly and dont notice it!. Breakfast was amazing so much food, its a great start to the day!!!We are staying here again next year! we really loved it!"
6,555,"Aug 25 2009 	It does the job - but don't expect anything else!	Travelling with two friends our choice of hotel seemed limited to find a triple room in London around the Bayswater area. However this room seemed to fit the bill and cheap enough between us for 106 room only.The tiniest lift you've ever seen - fits only 2 people at a squeeze, not for the claustrophobic! However, our room on the 5th floor was a good size and the room was clean and tidy. We had trouble with the airconditioning but the hotel sorted this for us, otherwise would have been very warm up there overlooking the rooftops! Also couldn't get the TV to work but we chatted so much it didn't matter to us, had trouble with the shower - it appeared that the taps on the wall worked in a strange fashion and you needed brute force to get them either on or off.Having said all of that it was pleasant. Nothing luxurious but then that's not what we paid for either.Very close to the tube station and not far from the main road to catch a cab - btw - DO NOT GET THE HOTEL TO CALL YOU A CAB!! WE ASKED FOR ONE TO TAKE US TO NEARBY KENSINGTON FOR A FIXED PRICE OF 18, IT ONLY COST 7 BY BLACK CAB!!"
7,555,"Aug 16 2009 	Great Location!!	Hotel was literally feet away from two tubes stop makin getting around the city a breeze. Very easy to get to from Heathrow. Heathrow express goes straight to Paddington station and then its only one stop to bayswater tube stop which is a block from the Hotel. Plenty of shopping and restaurants VERY close by. Rooms were small but to be expected in european hotels. Isn't terribly nice inside but was clean and a perfect place to rest your head and leave your stuff in safety. The staff was very helpful and friendly and even let us use thier front desk computer to check our email about a tour booking. The manager even called the tour company to confirm our booking for us. Also staff was quick to help with any needs including printing maps and directions for us. The people who said the staff were unfriendly must not have been friendly themselves because we felt the staff went above and beyond to help us. Overall, great place for people on a budget and who dont plan on spending tons of time in a room on vacation!"
8,555,"Aug 11 2009 	We didn't sleep all night : one of the most noisy and uncomfortable hotel.	We had booked this hotel expecting a good night sleep in what had appeared to be a nice and comfortable hotel for a reasonable price.Unfortunately, the Berjaya hotel didn't live up to our expectations AT ALL.First, our hotel room for three was located in front of the lift.... imagine the noise of the squeeky doors opening and closing until late at the night.Then, our room overlooked a sort of basement so that the air was extremely stuffy even with the window ajar... Last but not least, our room was right next to the air conditionning machinery : again, very noisy. The worst thing, WE DIDN'T BENEFIT from the air conditionning.In a word, try and sleep at the Berjaya hotel in a hot, stuffy, noisy and quite narrow room for 126 pounds!!! Really not worth it.On top of that, our legitimate complaints were very coldly received by unpeasant staff."
9,555,"Jul 27 2009 	Worn out Hotel but great location and reasonable price	Stayed for two nights at this hotel. Was thrilled with the location as it was literally minutes from two tube stations making getting around London very easy. Lots of nice restaurants and cafes within steps of the hotel. The hotel itself is nothing to write home about. The outside of the hotel is very pleasant but the rooms do not reflect the same. We stayed with our 4 kids - two teenagers, two younger - with two hotel rooms. They kindly upgraded us free of charge upon arrival and thank goodness they did because the 'suite room' we were given was just a larger size regular room. Our teenage boys rooms was very small and stinking of smoke but we didn't want to move their room as they were located near our room on the same floor. The rooms were tidy but also smelled damp. Bathrooms were clean. DO NOT EAT THE BREAKFAST - total rip off and lousy. go to the small italian cafe attached to the back of the hotel for a great and reasonable breakfast. Overall, I would stay at this hotel for the convenient location and reasonable cost if you are just needing a place to put your head for the night. If you are looking for something special or to spend more time in your room then don't recommend to stay here."
10,555,"Jul 20 2009 	good location nice room	gd location, near 2 tube lines. room i got was new and nice. got free upgrade to superior room. downside was that it has no a/c and cld get warm at nite during summer.. opening the windows don't help much too..another downside was dat it was noisy at nite coz there is a bar below and i was woken up a few times coz of high revving vehicles. my check-out receptionists weren't friendly too..no &quot;thank-you&quot; or &quot;see you again&quot; from her."
11,555,Jun 17 2009 	Excellent value for money	You can literally fall out of Bayswater tube station into this hotel it is so close. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a superior room as ours was still being cleaned. Room was very nice and plenty of room for the two of us. Bathroom was clean and tidy and the shower was really big. We saw the standard rooms as well and I can see why people moan about them. We have booked the superior room again for a few weeks time at just 83GBP per night. Really nothing to complain about at all at those prices.
12,555,"May 29 2009 	Very small basement room with water pipes that drained all night	I was given a single room in the basement. My window opened onto an alleyway. Although October, it was still rather warm in London, and there was no air conditioning, and I was fearful to leave my window open during the night. One night, the water drain pipes in the wall at the head of my bed ran water most of the night. Not even the ipod could drown out the sound! It took 5 minutes to get from the front door to my room, taking the elevator, then through a maze of very narrow hallways, and up and down stairs in the halls. I will not stay in this hotel again. Staff was friendly, though."
13,555,"May 2 2009 	Clean and well located - that's all	The hotel was clean and in prety good decorative order. It is very well situated within 50 yards of Bayswater Undergorund and 100 yards of Queensway underground. Their rack rates look horrendous but Internet prices seem just about ok for what you get. The staff seemed friendly enough and efficient. The room was tiny with a tiny shower room - no bath. How two people could fit into this double room I have no idea. The room, like, I think, very many of the hotel's rooms, was at basement level (with a rather insecure window into an area) and reached by a labarynthine series of steps, doors and corridors - luckily, on arrival you get a guide. The room was quiet until anyone in an adjoing room talked loudly or flushed the lavatory. The hot water was only luke warm and the radiator was stone cold. I did not try room service or the restaurant - there didn't seem much point with a cosmopolitan array of eateries just 50 yards away on Queensway."
14,555,"Mar 24 2009 	Walls made of paper	The foyer is deceptive, the rooms are quite buget, run down. Beds are hard, pillows thin and old and the walls are made of paper -could hear everyword of the TV in the next room. Staff were helpful, the problem is with the hotel itself. I would have rated this hotel average instead of poor if I had been able to get some sleep."
15,555,"Mar 23 2009 	NOISY not street noise	Hotel itself is fine but we were kept awake all night by the noise of the lift doors SLAMMING open and closed. We were in 308 or 309 which is directly oposite the lift doors. I complaned but was told we colud not be moved, this was on thursday night and hotel not full? staff not very helpful, we ended up getting EARPLUGS from pharmacy! otherwise the hotel is fine for what it is, very well located in cental london so you expect small rooms for the price."
16,555,"Mar 13 2009 	1998 very amusing experience	It's been my first trip to London for a week. I payed 360 DM a night, an increadable price, about 120 bp that time. The staff tried to give me the smallest room on 2nd floor with the smallest door, to reach with the smallest lift - I could enter the room only one shoulder in front :-))) , no place for my suit-case. - After a lot of theatre they gave me a (possibly maidens') room under the roof, with view over chimneys of the neighbourhood. 9qm I think including the smallest bathroom - shower 60x60cm, all the bathroom about 1,2x1,2m. I had to clean my feet separtely .-)))). The curtain always sticked on my body *lol*. - Breakfast after waiting in a queue, directed by lots of employees, not neccessary to take it there. - Nice bedlinen from Laura Ashley, allways extremly cleared up. - Good environment, tube, shops, park, restaurants. Knowing all this, would I stay there again? May be! After beeing cured from claustrophobia............."
17,555,"Mar 12 2009 	Overpriced box basement rooms	We were allocated at the basement with narrow and smelly corridors. The shower rooms as about the size of our bath at home, the only away to use the toilet was to sit side ways. One of the bedroom did not have hot water at the shower. Staff not very helpful."
18,555,"Mar 7 2009 	Small and loud but good location	I didn't directly pay for this room, so I do not know how much it cost.I stayed in two different rooms here and both were very small. One was very awkwardly arranged. There was no room in either room for our luggage. The bathrooms were also tiny, and one of our bathrooms had a leaky ceiling. This hotel was extremely noisy in the early mornings. One maid actually knocked on our door at 7am and asked if she could clean the room. She woke us up. Starting at 6am every morning we could hear the maids in the hallway talking quite loudly. Also, if you get a room near the elevator you ought to ask to be moved. You will not be able to sleep it's so loud. The breakfast was alright, over priced. Internet was over priced as well. Both of these things could be found right around the corner on Queensway for much much cheaper. The location and proximity to Hyde Park and two Tube stations is perfect. The neighborhood is great as well with many dining options and some cheaply priced tourist shops.The hall ways also stunk very terribly of cigarette smoke, the entire time I was there. This is difficult to deal with when you huff your way up four flights of stairs to get to your room and you can't get a breath of fresh air."
19,555,"Jan 8 2009 	Good quality/price	I found this big deal with my travel agency and I have to admit that 80 per night (Breakfast included) across New Year's day (usually this hotel is cheaper), was brilliant! I was in a single room, really small, with a tiny toilet, but was really clean and comfortable, with TV and everything. The breakfast was really good with a huge variety of stuff (e.g. croissants, muffins, cereals, jam, toast, white and brown bread, ham, cheese, yogurt etc...) and if you want the English breakfast, it's just 5 quid more. The location is great, just 100m off Bayswater station with every amenity just a pace away (shopping centre, Tesco, shops, every kind of restaurant etc). I really recommend this hotel for your short and long stay in the Big Smoke :)"
20,555,Jan 7 2009 	Smallest Room i ever been	We stayed at the Hotel for the Christmas Holidays. Bathroom is the smallest i ever seen in my life. I can't even shower without bumping my legs to the toilet bowl. Doors are noisy and room outdated. They also have the smallest Lift i ever encountered. Not recommended for people who have claustrophobia.( You might get claustrophobia here..Ha )
21,555,Dec 6 2008 	great little hotel	stayed here for 4 nights april 2008. Although room was small (bathroom even smaller) it was spotlessly clean. Good location near 2 railway stations. Breakfast was ok but didnt like to have to pay 3gbp for toast. Although check in is 1400 we were able to get into our room at 9.30 as we had transferred from another hotel. staff were very friendly and courteous.
22,555,Nov 9 2008 	Very small rooms	Room (no. 302) was small. Bathroom while perfectly clean was tiny. Shower curtain sticks to you as you shower.Broadband rates were 6 per hour which I thought was way too much.Excellent location though very close to Bayswater tube station but space in room was too small.
23,555,"Sep 13 2008 	Not to bad but noisy	Single room number 409. Not too big but big enough for me, clean, confortable and worth it to stay for 51pounds per night. Shower with no space, dificult to have a proper shower. The room is close to the lift so is quiete noisy, avoid this room if you have a light sleep. You have tea-coffe making and a 14&quot; TV. The hotel is near Bayswater road and any bus will take you to oxford street or picadilly circus... I prefer to have a 15 min walk to reach Marble arch."
24,555,Aug 27 2008 	Great Breakfast!	We stayed at this hotel as we were going to the Notting Hill Carnival and it was absolutely fine. Perfect location for the tube and all the bars and restaurants.We paid a very good price which included full english breakfast which was soooo good! Very surprised actually! Yes the hotel was a little tired looking and the bathroom was tiny but we did have a fairly spacious room with a nice view so we really couldn't complain at all.All in all I would stay here again.
25,555,"Jul 18 2008 	Good location but wouldn't stay again	As heading to Wimbledon for the tennis I picked this hotel for its location with easy access from Euston and also to the championships via district line. The hotel is &quot;budget&quot; standard; however I certainly didn't pay budget prices; even for London.The rooms are tiny and very much a squash for 2 people, the beds are falling apart with old mattress covers being stapled onto wooden bed frames. Mattress itself must be 20 years old and you're likely to have a better nights sleep on a railway sleeper.Bathroom small as per other reviews with another point too, that if you do stay here then get up early before all the hot water goes. Avoid if at all possible. There's better than this in Bayswater!!"
26,555,"Jun 5 2008 	Don't Stay Here	My wife and I stayed at the Berjaya from the 3rd to the 6th September 2007 and were very unimpressed. Whilst we knew that the standard of room would differ significantly to what we are use to in Sydney and places alike for the same Australian Dollar value, nothing prepared us for just how bad it was. The room was ridiculous. It was like a shoebox. You had to literally climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. The lift was like a wardrobe with a max. 2 person limit. The bathroom is beyond words. The shower was abominable. The day we arrived the 'tube' went on strike and we bussed it around, which wasn't too bad. When we checked with Reception on day 3 to see if they were aware if the tube was back up, they didn't, and advised us to walk to the station to see. If we were back home and were staying in a real hotel in Sydney or another capital city and for example Central Railway Station Sydney or Kingsford Smith Airport Sydney was closed for whatever reason, the hotel we were staying in would deliver a much higher standard of service and be able to provide their guests with up to date information, as to whether or not the situation was resolved, and if not, when the likelyhood of it happening was, as they would remain in contact with the other service provider to keep their guests informed.Apart from this level of dismal service or lack there of, we found the staff to be quite rude and unfriendly. Basil Fawlty could have done a better job."
27,555,"May 21 2008 	Crampy Room	First time stay in this hotel. Great location, just meters from Bayswater Train Station.However, the room and bathroom are too small. You even can not move your body in the shower.The receptionist never smile at all. I don't want to go back to this hotel again."
28,555,"Feb 23 2008 	Nice hotel in Bayswater	I've stayed in Berjaya Eden Park Hotel several times, and every time I had a great time there. The rooms are clean and nice, and my only complaint about the room is that they have a very small bathroom.There is also a continental breakfast included, and while it's nothing special, it's decent enough.The hotel is located in Bayswater, which is a nice place with several restaurants, pubs and smaller shops, and it's not far away from Oxford Street with the tube.I travelled to London to see a Chelsea-match at Stamford Bridge, and while it's not near the stadium, travelling to the stadium goes fairly quickly as you can take District Line directly to Fulham Broadway Station."
29,555,Jan 10 2008	Great Location and friendly staff	Great location. The staff was very friendly and the local area has great Labenese and Cinese restaurants. As a business traveller coming from LHR to Paddington the hotel was ideally located. American beware the hotel does not have cable but does have HSIA but is slow.
30,555,"Nov 1 2007	Not for the faint of heart	This place if you are looking for a big, plush room. It is extremely small. I am a small person myself and do not take up much room, but it was small for me. You can't shut the door to go potty (if you're doing #2) and the shower is so small that I couldn't move 1 cm without having the curtain clinging to my backside. Also, the bed is horrible. It felt like the 500 lb man had been sleeping in it for all the nights before I arrived. The pillow, well, I basically slept on my arm.I will say it was reasonably clean and the people seemed to be friendly and well, you get what you pay for, but in London, you still have to pay out the wazoo for even this low class hotel.Definately for the budget traveler, but if you are passing through I'd suggest staying at the Yotel in the airport, which is very clean (very small, but you expect it)."
31,555,"Nov 1 2007	Dont Stay there	I was very very disappointed with the Berjaya Eden Park hotel in London - I wouldnt recommend it to any person.  After a 26 hour flight I arrived at the hotel. The person showing me to my room was not willing to carry one of my backpacks - I was carrying two. We were unable to put them into the lift as the lift was only big enough to carry one person. The hotel is built like a rabbit warren, you need to go up two flights of stairs, walk across a corridor then go down one flight of stairs. It wasnt until I accidently dropped one of my backpacks down a flight of stairs the man showing me to my room offered to assist.  After my two night stay on the 9th and 11th of July 2007 I opted not to take the booking made for me on the 5th of August 2007. The person at the desk advised they were willing to cancel the booking but NOT willing to refund me the cost of the night on the 5th of August.2007 They advised I would need to get the refund direct from my Travel Agent when I returned to Australia. When I returned to Aust my Travel Agent tried to get me a refund for the night paid but the hotel would not refund me. Surely 3.5 weeks is sufficient time to give the hotel to cancel a booking and get a refund - not according to this hotel."
32,555,"Oct 17 2007 	small and run down...	My fiancee and I stayed here two months ago.We found the reception area to be not overly friendly. In fact I feltmore of a nuisance being there!The room is approximately 2.5m x 4.0m (8ft x 13ft) and that includes a bathroom and unneccessary cupboards which were run down and just took up space.We asked for a double room and recieved a twin room.The bathroom is pretty run down and the shower curtain is terrible. We couldn't have a shower with out the bathroom being flooded.The location is ok. Its close to Bayswater Road and you can catch the tube or the bus to major sights. Or stroll through Hyde Park to your destination. The next street is Queensway road with restaurants and a mall. But the area is dirty and loud at night as there is a hostel up the road and its a lively night spot.The breakfast is average. Not bad not great but oh well.I would not recommend this hotel. If you have a booking try and change it. I understand that its only a place to sleep, but its so hard to relax when its loud and your not comfortable. It wasn't dirty. I will give them that."
33,555,Oct 11 2007 	Nice and excellent location for 3 stars hotel	The hotel room is average for a three stars standard. But I do came accross some rooms which are smaller. Probably the reviewer in this forum is frequent travellers. So they tend to expect more for a three stars hotel. Would recommend this hotel for people who only treat hotel as &quot;a place to sleep&quot;. as its centrally located near a few underground. And near to a lots of tourist attraction. Since I only paid around 65 pounds (try search in ebay.co.uk) for a double room. I cant complaint much. Overrall its a good stay. but definetely not for ppl who look for luxury hotel.
34,555,"Oct 6 2007 	a rip-off	first, this is the second time i check-in to this hotel. i didn't have any problem last year.this year i made the reservation then i went directly to the hotel, it's in a nice location and near to two underground stations and tons of restaurants and shops, a stone through from the hydepark.well ..the trouble started when i talked to my wife from the hotel phone on two times (total 12 minutes) and when i wanted to check out i was surprised that women behind the disk gave me this yellow smile and said (we will charge you an extra 148 pounds for your long distance call), was i calling mars or something!!!after arguing her claims i asked for the manager who then came and started to tell me that the blame is on the phone company and bla bla bla.then he promised me to email the phone company to get a discount which he never did and they charged my credit card one day after i left them.believe it or not, the hotel refused to give me the bill cause they don't know how much exactly they would charge me until they settle it with the phone company.people ...this hotel is nice if u look at it as a sleep nest ..BUT THAT'S IT. never use any of their services."
35,555,"Oct 1 2007 	Run far far away from this place they call a hotel!!!!!	This hotel ENTIRELY ruined our vacation to London!!!! No joke!! DO NOT STAY HERE! Within minutes of receiving our key card, we went downstairs (yes the basement) and walked and walked and walked to the back of the hotel. The closest fire escape was were we just came from and there is NO WAY to pass someone in the hall without having to step into a door way to pass each other. Plus the housekeeping and laundry rooms are down there too. Our room was soooo tiny, the bed was against the headboard, the one side of the bed was against the wall and there was 6 inches from the wall at the foot of the bed. We could not put both suit cases on the floor and open them at the same time. Open one on the bed and one on the floor. Plus there were metal bars on the windows so if there's a fire, good luck! After seeing this 15 minutes later, we went back up to see if we could switch rooms. We were able to switch rooms closer to the stairwell but still in the basement. The room was about 2 feet bigger but there were no metal bars on the windows. So this is where we stayed. The man at the front desk (who could barely speak english, we are in England aren't we?!?!) said to check back with him after breakfast and see if there's an different room we could switch to. So we slept, ate breakfast and decided not to switch rooms. We come back after spending the day out to our room, and our key cards do not work! We went to the front desk and they gave the conceirge a new key and walked us to the basement and opened the door. Guess what we found!? There was another couple in OUR room, with their luggage and ours no where to be found!!!! I ran up the stairs and demanded to know what happened to my luggage, they told me that they went ahead and moved us, WITHOUT telling us!!! Now we are on the 3rd floor, room is smaller then the last one with an extremely loud ceiling fan and yes it was warm out and NO AIR CONDITIONING!!! So as you can see we did NOT have a good experience here. Please go elsewhere and enjoy London because we did not enjoy it. (F.Y.I. we had paid in full for the hotel back in March, so we were not able to get our money back being that we didn't stay there until September!)"
36,555,"Sep 24 2007 	No complaints here	We visited London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, and stayed a Saturday night here in a double room, costing 78 (booked in a panic at the last minute) including breakfasts. After booking, we read through these reviews and our hearts sank! Too late to cancel through the agent website we checked into the hotel expecting the worst, and I have to say: either we got very lucky or there are a lot of very particular hotel reviewers out there!Our room was fantastic - very spacious, on the first floor, with a huge comfy bed, a sofa, large windows onto the street and a perfectly adequate bathroom with a superbly powerful shower (although there was no ventilation). The location is great, if a little noisy at night, but you can't exactly blame the hotel for that! Staff were perfectly approachable, and the continental breakfast buffet was second-to-none."
37,555,"Sep 3 2007 	Depends on what you're looking for	If you're looking for a bed for the night in a good location (i.e. next to Hyde Park), tube stations (Quensway and Bayswater) with minimal time spent in the room then this is the place.However, if you're looking for a hotel with atmosphere, facilities, space, decor &amp; views then this is NOT the place.Our rooms were in the basement backing onto a restaurant with its associated kitchen noises (clanging pans, shouting staff). The staff and location just about compensated for the small and noisy rooms.One other thing - it's within the Congestion Charge zone and the nearest multi storey car park charges 22 / day. Attempt to park on the street if you can legally find a space. There are traffic wardens (and tow trucks) constantly on the prowl."
38,555,"Aug 30 2007 	Great location	I booked this hotel with a Berjaya Membership and was given a 'hostel' room. It was EXTREMELY tiny with a smelly shower curtain! I couldn't sleep that first night. With the help of an angel who worked there, I was 'upgraded' to the 'other' building with a 'normal' room. It felt like a presidential suite compared to the other room. I was happier and more comfortable. Luckily the weather was cold that we didn't need the non-exisiting air-cond.. Yes...there are no A/C in all the rooms. And there are no mini refrigerators either. (I had to throw out my delicious chocolate cake.)All in all, I was satsified with this hotel. I can't expect a 4star service when this place is clearly rated with 2 stars! You get what you pay for!Other positive points: Location IS great! Next block is Queensway which comes alive at night. Lots of restaurants, gift shops, money changer, cafes, etc."
39,555,"Aug 12 2007 	IdanClaes	A typical old english hotel with very narrow corridors and stairs. The room was small. The bathroom was tiny. But the bed was ok, you could have a good night sleep in it. it was fine for us because we were mostly out and came back to the room for showers and sleeping, we found that the location of this hotel to be just perfect. It's just a less than 5 minutes walk from the bayswater and queensway tube station, which is very convenient. lots of affordable shopping and dining around. The staff were very helpful in giving directions and making bookings for us.Ida and Claes"
40,555,"Jul 16 2007 	Extremely Disappointing	It pains me how tourists are ripped off in London. Don't let the attractive reception or exterior of this hotel fool you, nor the photos you might see on the internet. When I arrived at this hotel, everything was going well until I got into the cramped 2 person lift and ascended to my room. The corridors are incredibly small and the rooms are tiny. When I tried my cardkey in the door it didn't work so I went back to reception to tell them. They informed me that my room was 'dodgy' and the porter would let me in. After the porter let me into my room I was surprised that, even though the sun was shining, I had to turn on the lights because the window was so small it didn't let sufficient light in. The bathroom was so small, I could barely wash my hands in the tiny sink without getting water everywhere. The shower was also stained and everything about the room just seemed cheap and unfinished. Already dissappointed about the price i'd paid for such a dissappointing room, I realised that I wasn't happy with having to fetch the porter everytime I came and went so I complained at reception. Thecustomer service skills of the staff were little to none, and they told me there was nothing they could do about my faulty door. They weren't even understanding or apologetic, and didn't offer me any kind of compensation. The next day when I was due to check out I got a knock on my door at 2 minutes past 12 and a voice telling me I was due to check out. Never in my life have I come across this in a hotel.I got an online discount but the hotel rates are 130 for a twin room. I'm glad I didn't pay the full price as what I paid was already enough. The staff are useless, the hotel is a total rip off. People should get their moneys worth and this certainly doesn't apply at the Berjaya Eden."
41,555,"May 28 2007 	Horrible	Without doubt, this is the worst 'hotel' I have ever had the misfortune to enter. We had booked for two nights but only stayed an hour................. that's the length of time it took us to find alternate accommodation. Tiny, dark, damp, smelly rooms with an ensuite the Borrowers would struggle to make use of. Park benches and shop doorways would be infinitely more welcoming than the rooms and staff at this sorry excuse for an hotel. Berjaya Hotels &amp; Resorts, you should be ashamed!"
42,555,"Feb 15 2007	Very Nice	Having just spent Valentine's evening staying at the Eden Suite in this hotel I would like to share my experience.Our suite wasn't the biggest I'd ever seen but there was plenty of space for two people and featured a &quot;livingroom&quot; area with TV, sofas, minibar fridge etc, plus a small dining table with 4 tub chairs - all the furniture looked new and good quality. In the bedroom area we had a spacious, comfortable double bed, 2 wardrobes and a dressing table - again all good quality and attractive dark wood. We also had our own private patio which we didn't use due to the wet weather but it looked very nice.The bathroom was well fitted and spacious with marble tiles and white fittings. The complimentary toiletries were also very nice!The decor of the room was very nice with a dark green wallpaper accented with red and gold accessories.The hotel staff were friendly and efficient, plus the bar and dining room were very nice. The continental breakfast was plentiful and of good quality.Only minor criticisms would be the lifts are tiny and the corridors are very narrow too but this is a general feature of Victorian London buildings in the city centre. Living in London myself I know about small spaces in buildings!All in all my partner and I enjoyed our experience at the Eden Park Hotel."
43,555,"Nov 18 2006 	Do not stay here.	Dont be fooled by the internet sight.The hotel is NOT elegante, The rooms are not spacious, the staff was not efficient and friendly and the bed was not comfortable.The room was VERY small it was like a cabine on a boat next to the machine room."
44,555,"Nov 11 2006 	Worst hotel ever!	This is the worst hotel for the price that I have ever stayed in. We had booked a few days there either side of further travels in Europe and when we arrived for our first visit we were given a twin, rather than a double. Upon request we were then moved to a double room in the basement. The bed occupied most of the floor space and was reminiscent of our broom cupboard at home. We requested that we be assured a double room for our return (we had already paid for both visists before leaving home) and were informed that this would be possible.When we returned we were once again given a twin. The desk manager, arrogant and dismissive like most of his staff, blamed the wholesaler and then told me that as there were no patrons either leaving or arriving in the next few days, he could not move us. He had no record of our previous request.As I sat in the foyer the next morning I witnessed a procession of arrivals and departures.If you enjoy being lied to and paying exhorbitant rates for the priviledge, sobeit. Otherwise, don't go there!"
45,555,"Nov 10 2006	Mediocre hotel excellent location	My wife and I spent a week at this hotel recently. The best part about the hotel is obviously its location. It is literally around the corner from the Bayswater tube station, and a short walk to the Queensway tube station. Banks, restaurants, pubs, shops, malls and laundrettes are all within easy walking distance, and Kensington High Street and Portobello Road are slightly further. As for the room, we were in a basement room which was very noisy (no double glazing and very thin walls and floorboards!). However, we got used to the noise by the 2nd night and thereafter it didn't really trouble us that much. The room and bathroom sizes were OK and not as small as I had expected based on other reviews on this site, although I also saw another room that resembled a broom closet! The bed and pillows were not great, but the room and bathroom were always clean.The hotel was almost full throughout our stay, and is obviously popular notwithstanding its deficiencies. Practically, I suggest that anyone intending to stay at this hotel uses it merely as a place to bathe and sleep, and a well-situated base to explore the wonders of London. By minimizing time spent in the hotel, and maximizing its excellent location, the hotel is worth the money spent."
46,555,"Nov 7 2006	-smoking policy	We, 4 off us from Denmark stayed at this hotel for 4 days. However the hotelsmoking policy is very bad. I my self beeing a pibe smoker, came home from town one night, and felt like visiting the bar. In the bar smoking is allowed. When I took my pibe out and wanted to light it, I was told by one of the bartenders, whom I believe to be Russian, that pibe smoking was not allowed. Next to us 4 people were sitting smoking cigarettes. I told the bartender that it was regular cigaret tobacco that I smoked, and not smelly perfumed tobacco.I also told the bartender, that many danes smoke the pibe because they dont want to get all the toxic substances from cigaret paper. This however did not seem to convince the bartender, and therefore I was told to leave the bar. This is discrimination at its most. We will never come back.Kindest regards: Karsten Lyngsoe. Denmark."
47,555,"Sep 28 2006 	Never again	This was a very terrible experience.I will never repeat it again. I had to change a room, because it was impossible to open it with this authomatic card key.The staff at the reception is very unpolite. The rooms are extremely small, furniture very old.I woke up everytime I turned around in bed. But the rooms are clean. This needs to be saidNever again in this hotel."
48,555,Sep 16 2006	Nice Hotel Good Located	The hotel has indeed small rooms (when comparing with US hotels as some other reviewers did) but sufficient space for us because we were there only to sleep. Hotel was clean but a bit old. Price was OK. Breakfast was OK. Very silent located. We stayed there three nights and were happy with the nearby subway (Queensway and Bayswater).
49,555,"Jul 8 2006	Overall hotel ok	Overall hotel was ok. Rooms small and in Heatwave in London from June 11 to 20th with no air con or fans in room it was just too hot. Even with window open. Beds were not in good condition although clean linen etc. Just that pieces of fabric pulling off sides of bed supports. Mattress's needed replacing. All this sounds negative, however the location and general stuff were fine."
50,555,"Jun 2 2006	Loved It so cute...	Great place to stay, I'm pretty sure there are small rooms everywhere in London. It was very clean and there was enough room for my mother and I to move around in if we positioned our luggage (which was abundant) in the corners or armoir. We had a very pretty view out of our window (a little garden and a nice church). I believe the rooms may be larger in the back of the hotel (which is where we stayed). The bathroom (which had a very deep bathtub) was big enough to get ready for the day in (even with the door closed). The lounge was very pretty (just like the pictures) and there were nice views out of the breakfast room as well. I thought the free continental breakfast was very tasty too. More selection than I expected. If they ran out of something they refilled it within minutes. There are two VERY close tube stations (big plus) and Kensington Gardens is right around the corner. The front desk arranged a private car for us at the end of our stay which saved us about $50. Our only complaints were that the elevator was rediculously small (which is simple enough to work around) and that the beds were not too comfortable."
51,555,May 20 2006 	Memorable time? certainly for the wrong reasons	9 of us stayed there a couple of memorable nights. Memorable for the wrong reasons. The rooms are small but certainly big enough for Hobbits. The lifts are the thinnest and slimmest I have ever come across. One of the receptionists was unfriendly and had a row with her. It was a great relief to get out of her depressing sight. Value for money? Cetrainly not.
52,555,"Apr 11 2006	Are they kidding?	Three stars? I don't think so! This hotel is terrible, the worlds smallest rooms. The only word to describe the bathroom is 'ridiculous'. I am very slim and had great difficulty squeezing into the shower, i could not even fit one hand in the basin and smashed my elbows on the walls when using the toilet. It's like a rabbit warren, I had to go up and down in two lifts and drag my suitcase on it's side down the narrowest corridors in the western world to find my room. There does not appear to be any heating and my window overlooks the pleasent vista of rubbish, rooftops, crack addicts and dead pigeons. Of an evening the sounds of swearing and smashing of pots and pans enters your room from somewhere as you sink into a sagging bed, possibly manufactured in 1960."
53,555,"Apr 2 2006 	it's not worth it!	Stayed in the smallest room in the world, shower was absolutely ridiculous, so small had to constantly peel the curtain off myself, and water went al over the floor.The bed...where to begin? Tiny, squashed against the wall, and so so so uncomfortable! Slept on the floor for part of the night!Oh, and the temperature...boiling hot, even with the radiator turned off. Opening the window sorted out the stuffiness, but then had to contend with constant traffic noise.Sure, the location is great, but that's not enough!Avoid this place."

55,555,"Dec 20 2005	Great Value in London Bayswater	Getting value for money in London is not easy. I stayed at the Malaysian-owned Eden garden Hotel just before Christmas, my third time to stay here. If you are just looking for a clean bed to sleep in and your time in the hotel is minimal - and you want to save your money for shopping or taxis - then the Berjaya Eden Park Hotel is the place to stay. One constraint is that the hallways are narrow and the lift very small - a potential irritant if you have lots of luggage. But staff are efficient and courteous. There's wireless internet available through t-mobile. A continental breakfast that includes great ham and bread. And my single room had a bathtub long enough to soak in comfortably!Location - just around the corner from Bayswater tube station - which is just one stop away from Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express! Hyde Park is just a block away. For GBP40/night, I'll stay here again!"
56,555,Dec 1 2005	OH Dear !	Truly the smallest hotel rooms you will ever have the misfortune to stay in.The shower in the toilet would not have been out of place in a dolls house neither would the entire room come to that.Rest of Hotel like a rabbit warren goodness knows what would happen if they had to evacuate the place in a hurry.On the plus side it only cost 41 unfortunately you can see why.Avoid at all costs unless you are one of the Borrowers.
57,555,"Nov 27 2005 	Deceiving website photos	Stayed in a single room for 2 nights in Nov 2005, paid GBP41 per night inclu tax and continental breakfast. Good value for a central location. Baysway tube station is only 1 minute walk away. surrounded by good restaurants and shops.Lobby, dinning area, bar are ok but tired decor. lift only fits 2 people. average service from staffs. helpful conceige, super small-sized room, similar to a student's room in residence hall in the UK. single bed fits to the wall like a coffin, have little room to open a standard sized luggage, very small shower room with toilet, have to walk around toilet to get to shower, smallest shower even used, whole toilet became wet after shower.tv received 8 channels with remote control that is working. trouser press worked but not very effective.clean carpet, bed linen, towels that are changed everyday, smoking room but smell fresh, comfortable bed, quiet. ordered dinners in room, fish and chips for GBP7.50, steak GBP9.50 plus GBP2.0 for room service. very good quality freshly made food, good presentation and still hot. again good value for money too. but room service only available after 1700.tea and coffee making facilities provided in room, little milk sachets tasted horrible. Bar downstairs made horrible tasted cappuchinno, so ran across the road to Tesco to get tea and fresh milk.the room was not warm enough for cold days. staff bleeded the radiator and turned on full power, yet for such a small room, it was still not warm enough. i am still in 30s and came from nearby city, not Hawaii.will NOT stay there again."
58,555,"Nov 19 2005	like staying in a telephone kiosk	we stayed at this hotel for a weekend.The room was pre paid so we could not check out when we saw our room which was no bigger than a telephone kiosk.When i saw the bathroom i was afraid that if i entered i might not be able to turnaround to come back out.The toilet on the plane was not much smaller.The carpets were worn and the general decor needed a complete change.It was my first time in london and my last.The beds were dreadfull and this item is vital for any hotel good or bad.The hotel was full so there are alot of suckers out there including us.The location was great and very near bayswater tube station.If you can give this hotel(telephone kiosk)a skip,I wish i did."
59,555,"Nov 14 2005	Fantastic Location  Tiny Rooms	The hotel is really just around the corner from the Bayswater station, you only have to cross the street with all its great food places and shops. We were extremely pleased with the location. Be advised that the Queensway station is closed until May 2006 but there are buses to Lancaster Gate nearby.The reception staff was friendly enough, even sent somebody with us to find our room. From the entrance hall you look in to the bar where the fireplace was in use  very cosy. The tiny hallways and rooms have been described in detail before - they actually made us laugh. Since we were only there for a weekend and had only one small bag, the room size didnt bother us too much. There was a coffee maker in the room, a trouser press, soap, shampoo, body lotion, shower cap. The beds were a little soft and there was a constant draft from the window. Didnt see how the temperature could be regulated.Continental breakfast was included. They offered coffee and black tea (no decaf, no herbal teas) and juice, different breads, croissants, sausages, fruit, jams, cereals. Although it was very busy, they filled up missing items quickly (but didnt have time to be friendly).The price was very reasonable, 55 pounds for a clean 3star hotel in the middle of London, breakfast buffet included. However, if you want to spend several nights in London and have big suitcases with you, the miniscule rooms will probably make you crazy. Because of its great location I would still recommend it for an overnight stay."
60,555,"Oct 20 2005	Oh my God!	Was this a joke I thought as I was ushered into my room. It was the smallest hotel room I had ever seen, I felt I was in a broom closet. Maybe I could have dealt with the size, but I was in the basement and my window looked out onto a stone wall with piles of gabbage stacked against it. Was this a nightmare or what. It was dreary and so so hot. I came with my sister-in-law and niece who shrieked with laughter when she saw it, but wasn't so amused when their room was the same size but had two beds in it. I won't even describe the bathroom, but suffice to say, DON'T STAY THERE. I asked for another room the next morning, and after some haggling was able to secure another miniscule room, but at least it had a window that opened to the street and I felt I could breathe. It was a maze of corridors and steps and you needed a compass to find your room-upstairs, downstairs, left, right.....Never again."
61,555,"Aug 7 2005	great location - terrible hotel	Not a good first impression of London. The staff were not friendly, or helpful, the rooms were so tiny and always too hot. Our room had a view of the kitch exhaust fan which went on at 5 am scaring the pigeons away, it was like sleeping under the flight path at Heathrow.Our room had the lift right outside the door so all night it went thump or crash, we did havefun scaring Japanese tourist who would press the lift button and while waiting we would open our room door and tell them the lift was full and wait for the other one. :)The breakfast was ok but the staff were rude in the dining room and for that matter reception. Some people skills are needed. The only good thing about this hotel was leaving it."
62,555,"Jul 22 2005	Run away as fast as you can!!	Without a doubt, the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in! Actually correction, I did not stay in the room, but immediately left once I located the room (through the narrow, maze-like hallways) and felt the steamy air hit my face as I opened the door. Luckily, I was travelling alone so I could easily relocate and the room was not pre-paid, so I only lost money for one night. I did ask the reception staff to change my room, but was repeatedly told there was not another room available for that price. Even when I offered to pay more for a different room type, there was still nothing available. I was only offered a different room after I asked to checkout. By this point, I was dripping sweat and had no desire to stay in the stuffy room without a window that opens. I agree the location is great and the price was good, but not even that was enough to make me stay in this lousy hotel."
63,555,"Jun 20 2005	Relatively good value for the advantage of location	The location is very good - steps from the &quot;Tube&quot; - many good ethnic restaurants nearby. But the rooms (especially the bathrooms) are small &amp; old, but clean. Breakfast is average. The Staff is helpful, BUT constrained by the realities of high-priced/low quality hotel space in London."
64,555,"Jun 18 2005	Oh my God!	Not a good first impression of London. The staff were not friendly, or helpful, the rooms were so tiny and always too hot. The breakfast was ok but the staff were rude in the dining room. People should not be allowed to smoke in the rooms. Some people skills are needed. The only good thing about this hotel was leaving it."
65,555,"Apr 5 2005	The hotel rate and location offsets the shortcomings.	My husband and I stayed in this hotel during our short holiday in London. The room was a bit small but who cares.....we were out most of the time and only returned in the evenings. The location is fantastic with the nearby Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. Also there's plenty of restaurants within the area. The rooms were clean and staff at the reception counter were all friendly...thumps up, Berjaya Eden Park!!!! I will definately go there again"
66,555,Apr 2 2005	Small Small Small	Well the internet photos for this hotels website are deceiving aren't they. Small is the word for the rooms in this hotel. During our stay we stayed in 4 different rooms and they were all very much the same. You have trouble fitting two people in the room with their luggage. Walls are paper thin. Had a cold shower one night and no hot water the next morning. If you are slightly overweight you won't fit in the very small showers and in some rooms if you are tall you won't be able to sit on the toilet because of the gap between the toilet and the wall being so small you won't be able to fit.The twin rooms have narrow single bed mattresses that if you turn over you may fall out.Booked through a travel agent for various nights. Couldn't stay the whole twelve nights lost our money for 2 nights but who cares. Our new hotel leaves it for dead. Breakfast at the hotel is quite pathetic and not worth what they would charge if it wasn't included 7-50 pounds Another 5 pounds for English Breakfast.Other hotels we stayed at in our travels were far superior. We booked these ourselves from the internet after reading reviews on tripadvisor.Other comments on this site about the staff being rude and unfriendly are true.The hallways are small narrow and quite a lot of turns (reminds me of a maze or as they say a rabbit warren) and the stories about the lifts are so true.They charge 50p a day to store your luggage for the day and 5 pound if overnight. Other hotels do it for nothing.If you want comfortable rooms then my opinion is stay away from this place. There is better value for money if you reseach.
67,555,"Mar 8 2005	Never again	Fortunately our experience at this hotel didn't ruin our English visit but it easily could have.Firstly we were promised double beds before we left Australia yet the Concierge said there was no way any hotel in England would guarantee that! &quot;Besides&quot;, he said, &quot;there is not a double bed room available in the house&quot;. That was until I offered to pay the difference. Magically one appeared but not at the advertised (by them) difference of 64 pnds but for 90 pnds a night. I rang them from outside the next night to enquire about vacancies and they said they had several double rooms so I wandered in and asked (again) to be upgraded only to be told (again) there were no rooms available.The lift is so small that it only took one person with a bag to fill it and so slow that I decided to carry my bag up - I beat my wife who had been in the lift for 2 minutes at least.The room was tiny, there was not even a chair to sit on. This made it doubly difficult as the luggage was taking up the only available space in the room (on the bed).If you walked into the shower you backed out because there is no room inside it to turn. I'll try to attach a pix showing the toe of my shoe touching the door of the shower while the heel touches the tap on the opposite wall. If you flushed the toilet it took 15 minutes to refill so you waited paitiently listening to the cistern filling before heading in.Forunately we brought our own soap - they didn't supply the traditonal 'extras'.Also fortunately we bought souvenier mugs on our first day in UK because we accidentally broke one of their cups on day one (knocked it over in the tight space) and when we left on day 4 they still hadn't replaced it. Presumably my wife and I were supposed to drink out of the one remaining cup.On day two the management sent a letter to all guests requesting that we spread our breakfast times by getting up earlier as they were having trouble coping in the kitchen.The walls are paper thin leaving next to no privacy and the phones were shakey at best.If anyone paid me to have another holiday here I'd say &quot;no way, not even for free&quot;."
68,555,"Jan 17 2005	Hmmm.. a Mixed Bag	My wife and I went to London in early December 2004 for our honeymoon. Upon arrival at the hotel and after checking in, we discovered the tiny lifts.. that's OK though as we discovered our room was in the annexe of the building and therefore no lifts for us. We had to lug our bags up a flight of stairs (we did not want to tip anyone) and down the 1st floor annexe into traipsed into possibly the smallest hotel room in the world. It was unbelievably cramped. The width would have been just on 2 metres with 2 single bunks (despite having requested several times prior for a double bed). There was no room for 2 large bags so one bag had to remain closed at all times. And then the shocker: the bathroom... you couldn't sit on the throne without your knees clasing with the shower panelling. And speaking of the shower, there is no way anyone over 5 foot can comfortably use the shower as you can't bend down while in it.We tolerated this for 2 nights when on the 3rd night, the power went off in our room and the room next door. Mysteriously all the other rooms in the corridor still had power. We advised management several times of the blackout and it was on the 3rd attempt that they came and saw us. So there we were, sitting in the corridor (as it was too hot in the room) and we eventually waited about an hour and a half before management begrudgingly upgraded us to a larger room (with double bed) on the 4th floor. Worryingly when this happened (a Sunday night), the hotel employees advised that they could find no one to fix the blackout that night and that they were not trained to attend to a fire in the annex part of the hotel!! How reassuring!Our new room was much better and larger and we could finally scrub our backs in the shower. My advice to anyone going to this hotel is to refuse all single rooms in the annexe of the building and ask for a room in the main part of the hotel."
69,555,"Dec 8 2004	So good we walked out.	When we walked into the elevator it should have given us cause for concern, they were so small, this was after a two hour wait for the room to be ready. We walked down the narrow corridors, one at a time, as you couldn't walk side by side. We opened the door and saw the small room with a brick wall view, as it was in the basement. My Fiance opened the bathroom door, just in time to see the bath regurgitating it's old bath water. We complained and went out. When we returned we enquired about the bath, to which the receptionist had not been informed of it's progress. When we got to the room, the bath still looked dirty. There was toilet paper supplied, but not put on the toliet paper dispenser. We rang room service for a bottle of Muscadet and two glasses and 15 minutes later they still hadn't delivered it. While we were waiting we noticed the bed had hair on the sheets, and had obviously not been changed that day, despite this being our first day in the room! The room was also cold with no visible means of heating. We then asked to see the manager, who never came! At this point we had enough and found a better hotel around the corner. We then came back, finally saw the manager and attained a full refund. Avoid with your life."
70,555,"Nov 20 2004	Worst hotel I ever stayed in my life!	It was a horrible experience! I just came back from London and I can't wait to write this review right away coz it was really bad. We booked the hotel for Nov 12-14, and 18th. Coz we went to Rome in between. First of all, the elevator (lift) can only accomondate two person, which means 1 person and 1 suitcase. On our first check out date (15th), the lift was broken. I asked the staff to have someone help us to carry the luggages and they said they don't have anyone available so we have to carry all luggages ourselves from the 4th floor. While we were walking through the hallways, the housekeepers left all the towels, cleanins supplies, etc. on the floor. Even though they saw us moving the luggages through that cozy hallway, they didn't even move those stuff out of our way, and end up we have to move them ourselves. The worst thing is those stairs were not straight down, we had to make like 10 turns in order to get to the ground floor. Second of all, we asked to store one of the suitcases in their storage room so we don't have to carry everything to Rome. But they said they can't store it for us even though we are coming back to the hotel on the 18th. And so we decided to store them there for the day and look for another hotel. They're so cheap, and have to charge us 50 pence for each luggage just because we checked out already. So meanwhile my boyfriend was cashing out, I walked through the entire street and finally found a hotel that has availability and will allow us to store our luggage even though we didn't even pay deposit yet. Then my boyfriend wants to cancel our reservation and they said we have to do it online cause we booked it online! And they charge like 9 pence per minute to use their internet. Lastly, most of the staff there are not friendly at all, they won't even say hi to you even you have eye contact with them. I never stayed in hotel this horrible before. The only good thing was the room was pretty clean and that's about it!"
71,555,"Sep 6 2004	a horrible experience	We booked two rooms for two nights and when we checked in late on Friday night and went to our room we were extremely disappointed. The lift only held 2 people, how do you manage if you have children, the corridors were very narrow, the room was very small and hot and the bathroom was a joke. I grazed my knee on the hand basin when I sat on the toilet and when I got in the shower I could not bend over to wash myself. No fans or air conditioning in the bedrooms which were unbearable. Breakfast was continental and we would be charged 5 if we wanted a cooked breakfast. We found the staff not at all helpful or friendly. We moved rooms to the basement which was a little larger and cooler. Our friends who remained on the 4th floor were woken at 6 a.m. on the first night and 3 a.m. on the second by loud music being played in the adjacent room. The staff only agreed to go up and listen to the noise after my friend went down to the lobby and threatened to spend the rest of the night sleeping there. Definately a hotel to be avoided at all costs."
72,555,"Aug 9 2004 	Excellent Value!	LOCATION - Excellent! If you've read the other reviews, you'll know it's very near to Bayswater on the Circle line and Queensway on the Central line, 30 secs and 1 min walk away respectively. If you don't like being underground all the time, there's a bus stop directly across the road 3 secs walk away and busier bus stops to more destinations about 30 secs walk away. NEIGHBOURHOOD - Fantastic eating places nearby. Personally recommend Mr Wu's Chinese restaurant which offers buffet lunch / dinner for GBP4.95 per person - absolutely value for money! Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, fusion and all are a min's walk away. On the same row you have all kinds of fast food, Boots pharmacy, grocery stores, bookshops, Starbucks, internet cafes, courier service, money changer, souvenir shops, and even Whiteley's shopping complex which houses Marks &amp; Spencer, cinemas and is a pretty decent shopping place. Couldn't have asked for a better hotel location.HOTEL FACILITIES - Because I was in a timeshare unit, I didn't have breakfast allocated, so can't comment on it. Concierge was wonderfully helpful - especially in helping me carry my heavy luggage when checking in and out. They also provide facilities to store your luggage. Reception was very helpful as well. Beautiful and clean environment. My room was serviced every morning without fail by this sweet and well-mannered lady, even when I forgot to put out the sign to clean it. Very clean, they change your towels everyday, no problems with my bed or bathroom. Except the bathroom was quite small, so you're bound to wet the entire bathroom when you shower. Also, the walls are quite thin, so you can hear noises in the corridor or even your neighbour's TV if it's switched on too loud.SUGGESTIONS TO POTENTIAL GUESTS : No air-conditioning or fans, so I'd advise guests not to return to their rooms on summer afternoons because it'd be blazing hot and uncomfortable. Also, try to get the single rooms, because you'd be more comfortable. The double rooms are almost the same size as the single rooms, so if you insist on staying in a double room, be prepared to know that you won't be able to find space to open your luggage bag. Overall, I had a wonderful stay - thanks to the reviews on this website. I went with minimal expectations and came home a very happy person. Would definitely stay there again the next time I'm in London as it has an excellent location with excellent staff and a clean comfortable room."
73,555,"Jul 12 2004	If room size isn't a concern -- this place is a good value	Very nice and clean accomodations. Best thing is location. 30 seconds from Bayswater tube station. Rooms are extremely small and the bathroom's shower was about 4 square feet. If you're looking for decent accommodations and the size doesn't bother, you, the Eden Park is a great value."
74,555,"Jun 18 2004	Pass this one up	My husband and I were really disappointed with this hotel. We were unprepared for the size of the elevators, corridors and hotel room, but I would have overlooked that if not for some of the other negative qualities of this hotel. The bed had an old stinky foam mattress that gave us a backache every morning (and we're in our 20's). Our room was lower than street level and we had a window view of people's feet walking by directly ouside of our window. We were also visited by black bugs skittering around on the bathroom floor every morning. The room needed a serious airing-out. The location was good, as previously mentioned, and near some v. good restaurants. I would advise staying somewhere else next time. I know we will."
75,555,"Mar 25 2004	Berjaya Eden Park - Cannot get much better	This hotel was great! You cannot beat the location, being almost across the street from the Bayswater Tube station (Circle &amp; District lines) and a minutes walk from the Queensway Tube station (Central line). Also, a 2 minutes walk from Whitleys Shopping Center and Kensington Palace. The rooms are a little on the small side, but are very comfortable and have all the amenities. The elevator/lift is the only thing that could possibly need improving. It is tiny, think broom closet. The staff at the Berjaya Eden Park are wonderful. We booked through an online company to get a sizeable discount, but the hotel has a website that also offers discounts. The next time we are in London, we will definitely consider staying here again!"

1,557,Oct 25 2008 	Hmmmm	The staff who checked us in put us in a handicapped room!!! We are pretty sure we do not look handicapped!!!! There is strings hanging from the ceiling eveywhere. We acidentally pull one of the string thinking that is is for the light. The alarm went on. Still the staff did not realize they put us in the wrong room and did not offer us to change the room. When we come back at night
2,557,Sep 23 2008 	Awful Substandard Apartment	I booked this directly on the website and was sent photographs of the one bed apartment that they had reserved for me. I can only say that the photographs are a complete and utter misrepresentation of the standard of the accommodation at Berkely Park. The apartment was extremely poor
3,557,Jun 20 2007 	Best apartment hotel I know	I stayed here for 3 weeks while doing business in the area and I can only recommend this place. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the apartment was clean and to a very good standard. The convenience of Berkeley Park Apartments cannot be matched in my opinion.	
4,557,Apr 18 2005	Wouldn't recommend to anyone.	Firstly this is the same hotel as Berkeley Park Apartments
1,559,Jul 31 2009 	A Nice Hotel in Kent	A nice
2,559,May 26 2009 	Quite adequate for a weekend stay	We stayed at the Bromley for the weekend as we were attending a relatives wedding. On first impression I was very disappointed as the reception carpet was very stained and grubby. However we were impressed with cleanliness of the room and the Garden Restaurant where we had breakfast. The staff were extremely friendly &amp; helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The gardens are a credit to the gardeners they are beautifully designed and well kept. I would certainly recommend it if anybody was thinking of holding a wedding reception there. Providing they changed the stained reception carpet.	
3,559,Dec 7 2008 	Stunningly unfriendly staff	I stayed here as part of an overnight &quot;awayday&quot; with work colleagues. The hotel is a pleasant enough place
4,559,Sep 18 2008 	small but nice	stayed here as i was visiting family in the area-the hotel room was small but had everything you needed.at night the room was very hot even with a fan on! brekfast was lovely a large selection of foods!would def recomment this hotel to other friends.	
5,559,Sep 5 2008 	Clean friendly hotel	We are currently staying at the Bromley Court Hotel for one month due to sale of our house and not having found another one we like enough to want to buy. The room is on the top floor in the new wing and one of the larger rooms on offer with a dividing wall between the bedroom and the dressing/study area. The staff are extremely helpful and polite. They are happy to cook anything for you for breakfast if you ask them. The quality of the food is good. The bed is 4' 6&quot; which is small for us but there are plenty of rooms with queen and king size beds. We chose our room because of the quiet situation and made a compromise on the bed which only took a couple of nights to get used to. The rooms are cleaned well each day with the beds changed every other day. Towels are changed daily. There is an ironing room with non steam irons which is a bit difficult but okay in an emergency.The hotel has grounds of about 2 acres which makes a feeling of spaciousness and of course there is somewhere to walk on a fine day. It is unusual to find a hotel with such helpful
6,559,Feb 15 2008 	Basic chain hotel	I stay here several times a year as my company is based in Bromley. I have looked for decent accomodation in the area but have not yet found anything good. So I end up at the Bromley CourtThis hotel is in a residential area so a taxi is advisable at night from the town centre. This usually means that meals need to be taken in the hotel. They are quite expensive and very average. Room service is good - decent sandwiches nicely presented. Breakfast is better - usual buffet with a reasonable selection.The rooms are generally small in the newer section and large in the old section. The bathrooms are OK. Beds are soft and have the usual brown blankets (ugh!) and no duvets. No wi-fi but an internet connection is provided at a priceReception staff generally helpful - booking taxis etc.The hotel is OK but nothing to write home about.	
7,559,Oct 23 2007 	needs updating in areas	The first room i was allocated smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room- the receptionist moved me without any fuss.The next room was much better but the huge bed turned out to be 2 singles pushed together so had a very uncomfortable join in the middle.The bathroom was lovely &amp; clean &amp; very spacious.The hotel in general is just ok.The stair and hall way carpets need a serious clean &amp; general modernising as this gives the hotel an air of shabbiness. I would stay again for business trips but never for a personal trip.The restaurant was again just ok .I have definatley stayed in better hotels.	
8,559,Oct 22 2007 	Small room small bed...	We stayed in this hotel for a weekend with 3 kids. The rooms in the newest wing a really small
9,559,Sep 17 2007 	OK but nothing special	OK as a business base but wouldn't recommend it for a weekend away. Tucked away in a residential area it's a long walk to the centre. The public areas are ok but the room was small. Breakfast room was light and airy. Room service was prompt and the staff were all helpful and friendly. Happy to stay here if needs must but wouldn't rush back
10,559,Sep 3 2007 	Really enjoyed our stay at the Bromley Court.	Only stayed the one night on a Saturday as we were at a family party in the area
11,559,Aug 6 2007 	No complaints at all!	We stayed for 1 night on Saturday night. Check in and out was painless
12,559,Jul 23 2007 	Very pleasant but expensive	The room was quite small but very clean and bright. The window was just a slit and overlooked a rubbish bin. The room was well equiped with tea and coffee making facilities
13,559,Jun 1 2007 	My 2nd home - But then i have no other options?!?!	I stay at the Bromley Court with work at least 5 or 6 times a year and often for a week at a time. It's always nice and clean but could do with a spruce up.Yak blankets anyone!!!The facilities are OK
14,559,Apr 16 2007 	OK Small Room	The room was really small

1,561,Nov 17 2009 	Rooms in terrible state	Thankfully I only stayed at the Best Western Chiswick Palace &amp; Suites. My room had so many problems it was amazing...* Hot water took up to 15 minutes to come through.* Shower only heated up to luke warm!* surfaces in bathroom covered in grime.* Large gap under door creating draft.* Windows didn't shut properlyReception staff were friendly but uninterested in helping remedy my maintenance issues!
2,561,"Nov 16 2009 	Very Good Hotel and Great Value for Money	I have stayed in this Hotel for 4 nights.This is a very good Hotel and superb located for business, shopping, or just visiting London.Nice room with everything you need and a big bathroom with lots of hot water.Very friendly staff from the maids to the Manager.Very clean Hotel.Breakfast was good with plenty of choise for everyone.I recommend this Hotel to my friends and next time i visit London i will def. stay there again.Thank you for the lovely stay.Mixalis FotakisRoom No 9"
3,561,"Oct 6 2009 	Comfortable hotel	We spent 4 nights at the Best Western Chiswick on a recent trip to London. Clean and comfortable, close to restaurants and station. Good value for money by London standards."
4,561,Sep 28 2009 	lovely hotel in lovely chiswick	we stayed here for my husbands birthday its was a very clean and well maintained hotel good service and i felt safe here . chiswick is a atmospheric town with very friendly locals we were very happy with our stay here and will stay here in the future .
5,561,"Sep 18 2009 	I will not be staying again in this hotel	The bed is too small (I'm 1.8 m height). Hot water in the shower are coming after appx. 15 min. You have to stand in the bed in order to watch TV. The worse: I had to change my reservation from 4 to 3 nights. The manager charged me fully stating that is the policy of hotel. I think sometime a business can meet the customer and bypass the policy, especially in emergency case. But not here. in addition they charge in advance since they afraid that you will disappear without paying. I guess that these are the kind of guests that they deal with in this hotel. Therefore, my place is not there and I will not be staying again in this hotel."
6,561,"Jul 5 2009 	Adequate	Funny little hotel, we were away from main building in a dated room where there was some traffic noise. Breakfast was fine, and staff were good."
7,561,"May 31 2009 	""A very pleasant stay""	Everything about my stay was enjoyable! From the moment I arrived to the moment I left. When I first arrived (about 11:00 a.m.), heavily laden with bags and tired from my tube journey, they let me check in early (about 11:30). I stayed in a single room on the first (second, if you're American) floor with a lovely view of the back garden. I had a choice of using A/C or opening the window slightly for fresh air. Lovely to hear blackbirds singing in the morning. The twin bed was very comfortable, and clean. The warddrobe was large and quality-made. The included buffet breakfast was great and generous (except for slight xtra chg for sausage/bacon), there's a beautiful back enclosed breakfast dining deck for garden viewing. The communal computer with limited internet access served me fine, the staff were exceedingly helpful (e.g., helping me get my flight confirmation printed), the room was kept clean, well-serviced. Also, my room was quiet (though I realize this could differ from room to room and stay to stay) and the bath was HUGE and luxurious (even by American standards), and everything worked as expected. (NOTE: some rooms obviously are closer to the traffic side of the hotel and may not be as quiet). The tea/coffee and biscuits, etc replenished every day were most appreciated! I loved the handy little water boiler, so cute. My room also had a very handy and easy to use safe. Everything was so easy and convenient. The hotel is within 5-10 minutes walk to a choice of two separate tube stops in a safe and semi-residential neighborhood overall, with plenty of shopping and dining choices as well. The whole stay was great -- I was sorry to leave. I was easily able to pre-check-out the night before my flight left (early in the morning). This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had in my life (for the price), and I've been to LOTS of hotels. I especially appreciated the one female desk attendant. She was so helpful, kind and friendly, yet professional. I may be wrong but the only drawback for others may be that I did not notice a lift (elevator) anywhere. This did not bother me personally though. *My* only personal complaint (and this is Best Western's fault in general, I think, not this hotel in particular) is their flimsy metal toilet and towel holders. They tend to come apart at the slightest pull and then crash to the floor noisily! Bottomline: I do hope the Chiswick Palace &amp; Suites manages to keep up its high standards and keeps up the good work, because I will definitely choose it again if I'm fortunate enough to visit Britain again any time soon!"
8,561,"May 20 2009 	excellent - in parts	I recently stayed at the Chiswick Palace twice, on both occasions for one-night stopovers.What I liked: adequate breakfast, free wi-fi (in theory - see below), v. friendly front desk staff, clean and newly decorated rooms. Safe in room. Quiet location, in the sense that I heard little noise from outside. What I loved: the location. Reasonably close to Heathrow on the tube, if you calculate a journey time of approx. 30-40 minutes. Short walk to Turnham Green station. Chiswick High Road has many good restaurants, bars and cafs, an M&amp;S (food only) and Sainsburys supermarket, Waterstones bookshop, several charity shops and many independent stores selling virtually everything. Being away from the obvious tourist spots means less risk of tourist traps. It is also leafy - less concrete, more trees. Low rates: a room for around 60 quid including breakfast in a nice part of London is not to be sneezed at. What I disliked: on my first visit there was no Internet in the rooms (I stayed in the building at the back). On my second visit I had no hot water one day. The reason why I had no hot water was because there was work going on outside and, despite phone calls down to reception, no one told me to leave the taps on for five minutes (in the land of hosepipe bans) or more in order to &quot;bleed&quot; the cold water.OK these things happen, but no Internet service for several days in one part of the hotel should not happen when this amenity was advertised. Size of room and room proximity. For my first stay I stayed in what must be the smallest (single) room I have ever slept in, albeit strangely comfortable. I was next to a room which I believe to have been used by a member of staff on night duty; this is the only explanation I can find for constant to-ing and fro-ing at all times. The second room was larger and had aircon, unlike the first. However the room rate, with or without aircon, was the same. This I find a tad irritating. As for the proximity to other rooms, my single in the main building was perilously close to two other rooms and their slamming doors. Plus the fact that this is an oldish building with creeking floorboards and I was woken at 6.30 a.m. by someone's early start to the day. Would I stay there again? Yes indeedy, given the location, low rates, reasonable comfort and friendly staff."
9,561,Apr 18 2009 	Lovely hotel	The hotel is situated on the busy Chiswick High street and does not look very inviting from the outside but once inside the hotel and the ensuite rooms it was definately worth every penny of the 67.00 per night for the two of us. The area has good transport links and lots of places to eat and drink on your doorstep. The staff we`re friendly the breakfast good and would definately go back again.
10,561,"Mar 20 2009 	good base	We decided to take a trip up to London, so we looked on the web for a hotel outside the congestion zone and found the Best Western Chiswick Palace &amp; Suites. The was so easy to find, (with the sat nav) about 5 minutes off the end of the M4.The reception area looked very nice. There were two gentlemen on the desk, who were very friendly. We paid for our stay up front and one of them should us to our room, which was not in the main building, but through the gardens to one of their flats. It was a nice room, overlooking the main road with the traffic lights. We live in a quiet area, so we thought it would be quite noisy with all the traffic, but it wasn't.The hotel is on Chiswick High Road with lots of shops and restaurants. We were very impressed. There was so much choice of where to eat, eventually we decided on Frankie Bar and Grill, an italian restaurant just around the corner. It was very pricey, but nice.We had a lovely nights sleep in our big bed, it was 2 singles zipped together, but that was ok. Breakfast in the morning was a buffet breakfast. If you wanted a cooked full english it was extra.We wanted to spend the day in London, so when we checked out, we asked if we could leave the car there and take a tube into the City. The receptionist said it wasn't a problem. He gave us a map and told us some places to see in London. Its just 5 minute walk to Stamford Brook. We would definately stay there again"
1,563,"Good Location but very dated	This hotel is very well placed for South Kensington and Knightsbridge. Set in a quiet Georgian street 5 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall. The hotel is cheap and clean but is very very dated and in great need of decoration, the restaurant is located in a stuffy basement and I would only eat there as a last resort. Staff are friendly and helpful though."
2,563,"Nov 15 2009 	Friendly Hotel Superb Location Amazing Break	I stayed at the John Howard Hotel this summer with some of my friends for a city-break. It was a lovely hotel and the staff were very polite and helpful. For example, they recommended us a restaurant (which was very good) and gave suggestions as to what was the best way to see the most of London. The hotel is very clean (including the bathroom), and the hotel has everything you need. The location is incredible, it's in the heart of London but in the more sophisticated area of Kensington. Public transport is easy to get to, but it is easy to get to places even by walking.I really enjoyed this break and especially the hotel, I would strongly recommed staying at the John Howard Hotel if visting London, and I hope to be back very soon."
3,563,"Nov 13 2009 	Great location with friendly staff	Stayed for a total of 9 nights at beginning and end of 5 week trip (from Australia) so was able to compare to other hotels. Wasn't sure what to expect having read reviews about small rooms and a small lift.... was pleasantly surprised to find the room (E) more than adequate for the 4 of us and found a smaller lift in Cornwall! Beds were very comfy - floorboards are quite creaky and we had some inconsiderate neighbours above us a couple of times but its a very old place (in good nick) and mostly quiet. Staff were fantastic, especially the guys on night duty - all staff were happy to help put with tourist type advice and were fairly knowledgable. Its a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Glousester Rd or South Kensington tube stations - numerous eateries are less than 5 minutes walk away as is the Natural History museum. Felt very safe walking these nice streets. Hyde Park is literally over the road. Breakfast was no frills but fresh and tasty - could order extras if need be - didn't have dinner there. Would go again."
4,563,"Nov 13 2009 	Great hotel good facilities excellant location and very warming	Myself and my freinds have stayed at this hotel on many occasions for long weekends. The hotel staff and facilities are great together with the excellant customer service. Even at 4am in the morning the hotel staff arranged for pizza's and chips for us all which was great!!!Definitely a good stay, good location and the general ethos of the hotel is very warming."
5,563,"Oct 26 2009 	Great location...Hyde Park on your doorstep	My wife, I and our two young sons booked this hotel along with tickets to Grease. We arrived late on the Friday evening after a fantastic show.. travelled in style from theatre land to the hotel by Rickshaw, which cost the same as a taxi but was so much fun our sons will never forget it. The nightporters who showed us to our room were really helpful and it was no bother at all for them to make us some snacks to quench the hunger of two growing boys. The apartment was fantastic, really spacious and although it was in the basement this did not detract from it at all. Breakfast was really good with a hot food buffet plus other items to order. The reception staff were really helpful and directed us to the Diana Memorial Park in Hyde Park which is really worth a visit if you have children 12 or under, we had hours of fun and all for free. Definately would stay here again.. it is in a beautiful part of London, great staff, spacious accommodation and we think good value for money."
6,563,"Sep 23 2009 	Close to everything	The room was small, we requested twin beds, reading other reviews we saw that most of the rooms and beds in London are small. The beds were comfortable as well as the pillow. Usually, beds tend to be very hard and pillows are uncomfortable. But that was not the case at this Best Western. The restaurant was expensive and the food not really all that good. It's best to take the #70 bus at the end of the block or walk a few blocks to find a variety of food. The staff was not very well informed regarding the area. Be extremely careful getting out of the bathtub. It is higher than the norm and very slippery."
7,563,"Sep 22 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Kensington	I have stayed at this hotel several times. It is so conveniently located in a very fashionable part of London. Harrods,The Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and shooping in Knightsbridge and Kensington are all in walking distance.The rooms are great in particular the apartments with fully equipped kitchens. The staff is excellent as always and there is nothing too difficult for them to do for you. You really can't go wrong in selecting this hotel. Being such a trendy area there are excellent restaurants to go to like Launceton Place, Wodka London's best Polish Restaurant.The Manor of the Gate restaurant downstairs provides a very good breakfast to get the day started.."
8,563,"Sep 21 2009 	Aussies did it style	Three of us stayed at the John Howard from 3 September for four night. We were fortunate to get the apratment which had two bedrooms, lounge room and kitchen which was awesome. The hotel was very clean and friendly staff. It is in a great location to transport and gardens etc. You can judbe a hotel by its bathroom and towels, and I can tell you the towels were fluffy and big. I would certainly reccomend the John Howard hotel, not just because he was our former prime minister."
9,563,Sep 17 2009 	Great location great value	I stayed here last night as I was attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. This hotel is a great location for this purpose. Our room was small but nevertheless clean and quiet. I would most certainly stay here again.
10,563,"Aug 20 2009 	Decent London Hotel	Stayed here from 3 to 7 August 2009. We had room E which was a family room on the first floor. Reception - Helpful and efficient. Nightporters command of english wasn't so good but then he maybe didn't understand my northern accent!!!Room - Size excellent for a family room. King Size Bed, two proper single beds for the kids rather than a sofa bed or roll aways. We also had room for another single bed, there was so much space. Tea and coffee making facilities plentiful and replenished daily. Towels changed every day. Desk, TV, hairdryer. phone, trouser press and ample cupboards for clothes and to get rid of those damn suitcases that always seem to clutter up the room!!! Air conditioning unit which was useful when it was hot but due to the area the hotel is located in only circulates the air in the room after 10pm due to some regulations. Once it was operating it was extremely noisy ...more of that later!!The one thing that really let the room down was that it was looking decidely shabby, especially the bathroom. A lick of paint and some general repairs wouldn;t have gone amiss.Breakfast - Excellent breakfast which really set us up for the day. Fruit juice (wide variety), fresh fruit, cereals, meats, cheeses, croissants, pastries, full english with fried egges to order which were superb. Full English included tomatoes, mushrooms, baked beans, sausage, bacon and scrambled egg plus you could order fried or poached eggs and kippers / smoked salmon with scrambled egg too. Plus coffee, tea and toast. We were B&amp;B but if not you pay 12.50 per head for the breakfast. You could have everything (if you could eat it!!) and return as often as you like. The staff were attentive and courteous. Again it could have done with a spruce up in places.Location - Literally just round the corner from the Albert Hall and Hyde Park. Ten min walk from the Museums (e.g Nat History, Science and V&amp;A). Choice of two tube Stations - south Kensington and Gloucester Road. Both are on distirct, circle and Piccadilly lines and just within zone one of the tube network. It's a good 10 to 15 min walk to Gloucester road and whist it seems slightly shorter to South Kensington, you walked a long way underground before you got on a train. So on balance we tended to head for Gloucester Road as it had cash machines outside, a taxi rank if it was raining and a tesco express / resturants close by should we feel peckish on the way back. Very short tube journeys to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Westminster so ideally situated. The lenght of walk was a bit of a pain after a long day on our feet with two kids so some days opted for a taxi which was only 3.Noise - My biggest bug bear was due to another resident in the hotel in the room above. They went out one night and left their very noisy air conditioning unit (which wasn't air conditioning by that time) on and then left it on all night. It was really loud. They came back at 2.30, noisily and then left it on all night. It came on for three minutes and then I had two minutes peace again before it came back on. I reported it to reception initially around midnight but they advised that the people had gone out and therefore they were unable to do anything!! I literally had only an hour or so sleep that the night. The following night it seemed to go off just after 1am which although not ideal at least meant I got some sleep. We didn,t have our air con unit on after 10pm because it was too noisy for us never mind anyone else. How they could have attempted sleep with it on in their room I'll never know. Perhaps the hotel need to look into this because it did spoil my stay somewhat. That apart everything else was fine and with a little spruce up and refurbishment this would be an excellent place to stay. I would certainly consider returning"
11,563,"Jul 10 2009 	Just so great	this hotel is ideally located in Kensington borough, not that far from Hyde Park and less than 1 minute walking from the Queen's Gate (entrance of Kensington gardens). the lobby is nice and classy and the team is absolutely helpful and pro.the room we booked was one of the junior suite and it was large enough, comfortable, lovely decorated and calm. the room service is fine and on time as is the breakfast service in the room. we appreciated the house cleaner woman whom was delicate and efficient &amp; we thank her here.the price was not that high for this quality of services (the sooner, the better) and the location area ! Easily reachable by the tube (circle) from St Pancras, it is direct with bus n10 if you want to have a quick view of the city (bus stopping royal Albert Hall, 200 m from the hotel !!)..."
12,563,"Jul 7 2009 	hotel ideal for royal albert hall but NO hot food on a Sunday!	We were going to see The Killers at the Albert hall on 5th July and chose this hotel as it is only 3mins walking distance.My daughter needs to have use of a wheelchair and it was pointed out that there are several steps up to the door and although the lift is small I was assured that would be no problem and help would be on hand if we needed it.On arrival I was left to struggle up the steps and checking in seemed to go smoothly.One of the staff took our case but on entering our room which was supposed to be a twin bed junior suite,we found it was double bed!We were then given the only suitable twin room,the staff seemed annoyed that I had queried this and disregared the fact that it I'd booked a suite in the first place!I certainly wasn't happy so went back to reception and really complained to a lovely staff member who (cut a long story short) within 20mins had sorted out a large junior suite that had 3 windows,a large sitting area and large bathroom!!She even helped me move all our belongings plus wheelchair.The room was on the 4th floor but at the back so it was so quiet-almost forgot we in the middle of London.Room was all very clean and beds comfy.Breakfast is served in the basement and was basic-once again staff not over friendly.This hotel is simply ideal to walk to the RAH and within 10mins walk to the high street where there's plenty of places to eat etc.BUT we didn't find the staff too friendly as needed help flagging down taxi but woman on desk told me to do it myself-I just didn't want to be wandering up and down the street with my daughter in wheelchair!!.We found it VERY strange that a busy hotel like this DOES NOT have a chef working on a sunday evening!! Room service only serves sandwiches and ice cream so be aware if you arrive weary,and hungry on a sunday you will have to eat somewhere else!!"
13,563,"May 5 2009	Don't accept a room on fifth floor	We arrived at the John Howard at 11 on Saturday morning but check in was not until 2.00. They were happy to store our luggage and upon our retun we were pleased to find they had put the bags in our room.This is where things went downhill though as we were shown to an appartment on the fifth floor which had hideous furniture which was stained and loked like it had been in situ since the 70's.On raising the issue with reception I was told nothing else was available but refusing to accept this I was given keys to room 56 and room 11 to see what I thought.Well lets just say don't agree to stay on floor five. Room 11 was quite nice, with flat screen TV, a large bedroom and bathroom and was spotless and exactly what I was expecting when booking the hotel.We did not eat here so no idea what food is like. Location is excellent, across the road from Hyde Park, near to Kensington and Knightsbridge and a pleasant stroll to Gloucester Road tube station.Overall a pleasant stay once the room issue was sorted.I feel the hotel lets itself down by offering the rooms on floor five to people."
14,563,"Mar 12 2009 	really decent place to stay.	spent 2 nights here with my partner, we booked through superbreaks. we did expect it to be quite nice as the area of kensington is nice, we were really impressed with our room, we had the hallway. then a bathroom leading off it, then a good sized lounge leading off the hallway, it was big enough for a desk a 2 seater sofa and a 1 seater, and a coffee table and a decent tv. then through some small double doors was the bedroom which also was of a great size. king size bed with bed side cabinets and a chest of drawers and a smaller tv. we were really impressed with our rooms and would definately stay at this hotel again, the decor is slighty dated but to be honest if that were to cause anyone problems then they would have to be super picky. the price was really reasonable too. 150 for 2 nights including full breakfast which was really nice, there was quite a bit of choice. the only slight problem is that the tube is a little bit of a walk away, 10 minutes i would estimate, the tube is on gloucester road, it is a pleasant walk though. overall i would definately recomment staying here, if you wanted to be right next to a tube station though then probably not for you, but in all other aspects it was wonderful."
15,563,"Feb 18 2009 	decent room...	I booked to stay here for 3 days in the middle of a week away. The hotel is in a fantastic location for all of London. The reception staff are very helpful, and when I left my bags early on my check in day, they put them in my room for me before I'd even got back! The room was nice, not huge, but big enough, with a lovely bathroom and a big bath! I booked for Dinner, bed and breakfast - but after dinner on the first night I vowed never to eat there again. The set menu sounded lovely. I ordered Grilled vegetables but when they came (within 1 minute of ordering) stone cold, I knew something was wrong! I then had mushroom risotto which was vrey chewy and runny - not how I like risotto! And unfortuntaly the waiters thought it rather amusing to laugh at me for reading a book while eating my dinner alone...Breakfast is a serve yourself buffet. The coissants and jam are very nice, but the cooked breakfast leaves a little to be desired. The sausages tasted like they were frozen from a supermarket, and the bacon had been cooked and left for far too long - but the tomatoes were nice :o)I must admit that for the rest of my stay, I smuggled pizza up to my room!When I told the reception why I wasn't going to have dinner for the remainder of my stay, they didn't really care...So, if you want a lovely room only hotel then the John Howard is great, but I just can't recommend the food!"
16,563,"Dec 14 2008 	Apartment in Kensington for a bargain price	We booked to stay in a double room for a Saturday night at the John Howard with Superbreaks.com. Including breakfast it was 120 so quite reasonable we thought.But when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a one bed apartment and when she showed us to our room, it was a fantastic suprise. The apartment had a fully fited kitchen, lounge, bathroom and really large bedroom with a massive bed.While some of the fixtures were quite dated, such as the old fashioned hair dryer in the bathroom, we had so much space it really didn't matter.It's in a great location and I'd highly recommend it, especially as it seems these upgrades might be quite common with the couple behind us also being given one."
17,563,"Nov 30 2008 	Close to The Royal Albert Hall!	We had tickets to see The Killers at The Royal Albert Hall and needed somewhere to stay, close to the Theatre.My Mother and sister came with us, as we were gong to do a bit of &quot;sight-seeing&quot;, the next day.The location was excellent, the staff were there if needed and the apartment we stayed in, was just what we wanted. Clean, comfortable furniture, plenty of tea/coffee making facilities and space enough for four people. (We had a two-bedroomed apartment.)We would definately go back to The John Howard Hotel again and considering the part of London it is situated , thought it was excellent value."
18,563,"Nov 25 2008 	Great Location	Excellent location, friendly staff, pleasant room, good value for money. I booked through a booking website, with no first hand knowledge of the hotel, so was very pleased to find it. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
19,563,"Sep 23 2008 	Top comfort	Warmly welcomed at reception, hotel layout explained very well.The staff were friendly and helpful in all situations.The room was very comfortable including mini-bar.Room service excellent.I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly.Very close to the Rpyal Albert Hall.Kensington high street ten minute walk, but frequent busservice. Taxis plentiful, of course.I thouroughly enjoyed my stay."
20,563,"Jun 30 2008 	A tired experience	We stayed three nights at the John Howard in a 2 bedroom unit. The staff were all friendly and the unit was well equipped. HOWEVER, the hotel is very tired. Our rooms looked like they had been furnished 40 years ago and were in desperate need of an update. I have stayed in many London hotels, but none with such poor sound insulation between creaking floors. All in not a place I would return to. While I don't like to be critical, until this hotel receives a needed reno I would search elsewhere for a place to stay.JK, Canada"
21,563,"May 27 2008 	Fine	Stayed at the hotel in April for three nights. We were able to check in very early luckily without paying for an extra night (arrived at 5am from Australia). We had a one bedroom apartment, a little worse for wear and with some rather squeaky floorboards (sorry to whoever might have been below us!), but otherwise the apartment had plenty of space for the three of us (2 adults + toddler) to move about in. Location was great, except for the work on the tube over the weekend we were there. Our room was at the back of the hotel, and took a few doorways to get through - a little tricky with a stroller, but not too bad."
22,563,"Mar 24 2008 	Good location but very disappointing.......	Stayed here for a Saturday night with my partner.The location is very good directly opposite Hyde Park and at the top end of Kensington High Street but really this is the only good thing to say about the hotel.When we arrived at the reception to book in the attitude of the receptionist was very unfriendly however she advised us that we had been upgraded to a bigger room.When we got to the room on the 4th floor, via possibly the smallest lift ever made, we saw from the notice on the door that we had an Apartment (?) When we got inside the place looked and smelt like it had not been used for weeks.Both the bathroom and the main bedroom were ok with fresh sheets, but the rest of the apartment was very dirty and the kitchenette was falling apart. Thewhole place looked like it was lived during the week possibly by staff and let out to guests at weekends.When we got back form our evening out we asked the guy on reception if room service was still available. It was 11.15pm and he said there was 24hr service. When we got to our room i rang and ordered some coffee and something to eat. I was told it would be with us within 20mins.After 40mins we were told that the order had only just been given to the kitchen and that there would be another 40min wait. By this time we were not too concerned about room service and so i told them politly not too worry. At hearing this the guy on the end of the of the phone started ranting and raving. I could not believe what he was saying and asked him to calm down. This just set him off even more.We decided to go and get something to eat ourselves in the High Street. When we got down to the reception my girlfriend mentioned what happened to the night reception. He was not concerned at all.I can see from other comments on here about this hotel that there have bee problems with the staff in the bar so perhaps we should not be too surprised. But a hotel in this part of London needs to be a lot better at customer service and room cleanliness.Be careful, stay in a normal room and whatever you do don't ask for Room Service..........."
23,563,"Mar 3 2008	Great hotel even better location	Lovely older hotel, upgraded to junior suite. Great location close to Kensington park and only less than a 10 minute walk to Gloucester road tube station. Highly recommended at 107 per night. I think a good price for London."
24,563,"Jan 4 2008 	Very comfortable	We stayed 3 nights in one of the apartments (or 'suites') booked through MS travel, recommended on the 'apartment' part of the John Howard entry, and saved a lot of money by doing so.The location is great - yes, it is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube (Gloucester Road), but buses run along the end of the road frequently. Ideal for early morning walks in Kensington Gardens, perfect for the museums and not too far from supermarkets for stocking up the fridge.I was initially disappointed that we'd been allocated the basement apartment (B), but it turned out to be lovely and quiet, with plenty of space. There were a few essential items missing but the staff dealt with this very quickly. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment overall was warm and cosy. The only downside was a noisy boiler, but this was easily silenced by turning down the thermostat.Breakfast was included, and was fine - not brilliant, but again, the staff were very accommodating, and happy to cook to order. We were amazed to get a table for a meal on New Year's Eve and the food was good; price was amazing! There only seemed to be one poor guy working though, who did his utmost to serve everyone and find tables for those who hadn't booked whilst remaining friendly and helpful. He deserved a medal!Overall, very helpful and friendly staff; decor a little tired in places but very comfortable. I'd certainly stay again next time I'm in London."
25,563,"Dec 1 2007	most convenient for Royal Albert Hall	You cant get much closer to the Royal Albert than this which is a verygood reason for using this nice little hotel. We were upgraded upon arrival to a nice room with large bathroom, a bit dated but then this is not your average &quot; battery hen&quot; style hotel thankfully. A downside would have to be what passes for a lounge bar situated to the semi basement, as it happened it was closed when we returned to the hotel at 2220 but having seen it we were glad, very cramped with space for around 10 guests at a push, and so gloomy. The restaurant was also closed so we decamped to the Gore across the road which was heaving with diners/drinkers from the RAH, we could only assume our hotel is not interested in catering for thier guests. All in all and for the price this was a good choice of hotel and the staff were very helpful,we would have no hesitation in staying again."
26,563,"Nov 20 2007 	will return	Lovely hotel,excellent staff,we actually we upgraded on arrival.A very good location Albert Hall next door and number 10 busdirect to Oxford street 2 min.away.Will be back."
27,563,"Oct 29 2007 	Great little hotel	Enjoyed the hotel. Good location for the Royal Albert Hall. Rooms were clean, tidy and quiet. Would definitely stay again"
28,563,"Oct 17 2007 	Quiet and comfortable hotel	We enjoyed our recent stay at the John Howard. Our room was extremely quiet and comfortable. We had a 'deluxe' room which meant a queen size bed instead of a double, and a little more room. There is a computer with internet access and USB port available adjacent to the lobby for guest use, they charge more than the local internet cafes but it's convenient for checking email or for one person to use the internet if the travel companion is resting. As others have mentioned, it's about a six block walk to the Gloucester Road tube station, that is the only disadvantage and should be considered if the weather is bad. On the other hand, the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace are steps away. The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Natural History Museum and Science Museum are a short walk away. There are restaurants along Kensington High Street and around the Gloucester Road tube station. The staff members were helpful and courteous, answered our questions, called cabs etc. I would happily stay there again."
29,563,Oct 7 2007 	Excellent Value and Location	We booked this online and got a very good rate. On previous visits to London we have stayed at a hotel just off the Kensington High Street for its convenient location but it has become SO expensive we decided to give the John Howard a try. At less than half the price of the other hotel we were not sure what to expect but were delighted on our arrival at the hotel to find it much smaller and cosier. It is about 10 minutes stroll to the Kensington High Street Tube Station but the area very classy and quiet - yes quiet! The staff were excellent - very helpful. Our room was on the top floor at the back of the hotel and so quiet we slept with the windows open - which if you have been to London before is almost impossible with the noise of traffic. It was a large room with a large bed and wonderful feather pillows - the decor is a little dated but then modern decor would not suit this wonderful old building. Spotlessly clean with fresh towels daily and well stocked with drinks tray and a lovely basket with toiletries. Breakfast was very good and once again the staff very good. We will definitely be staying there again. It has everything the 4* hotel had but with a much bigger room.
30,563,Oct 5 2007 	Very Good	Booked for one night and have to say was very pleased with this hotel.We arrived early but this was no bother to the recepionist who was very polite and showed us to our room which was a junior suite. Room was beautifully furnished with plenty of room and spacious bathroom. The nice surprise was french windows on to a balcony. All was very clean and well appointed.It is very convenient for Royal Albert Hall (5min stroll) and Knightsbridge. Would visit again.
31,563,"Aug 25 2007 	""No Thanks ...""	The Pros:The Best Western John Howard Hotel is moderately clean and located in a great neighbourhood, just minutes away from Kensington Gardens and the Royal Albert Hall. It is a ten minute walk from the Gloucester Rd. undergound station. The staff is polite and accessible.The Cons:Upon checking in, we were told that we had been &quot;upgraded&quot; to an apartment. This apartment was actually a basement room with a kitchen that looked like it had not been lived in since Thatcher was in power. The cleanliness of this room was highly questionable. We refused the upgrade, and were given the suite that we had originally booked. The suite was cleaner, but there was still black mould growing on the showerhead in the bathroom. The in-suite Tea set was dirty. The bed was hard as a rock, matching the stiff pillows. The interior design was straight out of the the '70's, and I doubt that it was nice-looking, even then. Considering the price of this hotel, I would not recommend it to anyone and would not stay there again."
32,563,"Aug 1 2007 	Adequate	We were bumped to this hotel from the Best Western Phoenix, who was overbooked. We arrived before official check in and when I stated that I wanted to leave my bags as we wre meeting family across the city they tried to get me to leave my bags in the lobby claiming that they would be taken up later. When I insisted that they stow my bags in a more secure location they moved them to a hallway behind reception that was only more marginally secure.We were told when we were bumped that they were putting us into an Executive Room because of the mix up but the bedroom was no bigger than a traditional twin though the bathroom was a bit bigger. No view from our room - we look out onto the alley way! The hotel elevator was one of the smallest I've ever seen and creaked and bounced while you were in it so we took the stairs most of the time. This is cleary a very old hotel, evidenced by the fact that there was a notice in our room stating because it is a 'Heritage' hotel the AC is shut off at 11PM each night, I still don't understand why. It got very hot, very quickly so we asked for a fan, which they did provide.While the hotel is in a nice neighborhood, there are no shopping or restaurants within a decent walking distance and the tube, train stations and museums are also a significant hike away. We didn't try out the restaurant, which seemed pricey, and the menu was very, very, very limited.Wouldn't stay here again."
33,563,"May 27 2007 	Nice splurge	I recently spent 5 nights in London, splurged to stay here because I was seeing concerts at the Royal Albert Hall three nights in a row. (I usually book into a bare-bones B&amp;B near Victoria station.) I had Room 46 and it was lovely-- a double room with a queen-size bed. That room is on the top floor, at the back. Nice and quiet. I couldn't hear anyone else's plumbing or anything through the walls, either. It appeared to be newly redecorated. I booked through the Best Western website, which offers more, and better, price options than the hotel's own individual website. I paid months in advance and got about 35% or so off the rack rate. I actually thought changing my trip to November but I would have simply lost the money-- there was no luck when I called Best Western to see if I could transfer the dates to November. So if you get the early pre-paid web special rates, I guess trip insurance is the only way to safeguard your investment. To be fair, I was warned in very large print at the time of purchase that it was a non-refundable reservation. I didn't expect any money back, just was hoping to apply it to a different set of dates. The hotel has free wi-fi computer access throughout, but I had traveled light and not brought my laptop, and ended up paying to go online in the hotel lobby computer. I think it was a pound for each 10 minutes. It would be nice to include 20 or 30 min a day with the room fee. The neighborhood here is lovely, of course. It is a bit of a walk to the tube but on the way there's a nice specialty grocery store, and a Starbucks. There's also a Waitrose grocery store next to the Gloucester Rd tube station. I loved this place!! I hope I can afford to splurge again when I go back to London in November. I have a friend who has stayed here 3 times and has always been happy with the suite she gets. I was worried when I saw some of the reviews but trusted her recommendation. Maybe she and I have been lucky. Perhaps the hotel is gradually being updated. This is why I have provided my room number.  The maid service was good, there were plentiful towels and even facecoths (a rarity in Europe!) and shampoo and body wash etc. It was lovely to be so close to &quot;home&quot; when leaving a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. There's also a classy bar/bistro right across the street, called The Gore. The drinks and sandwiches in the bar are expensive but good!"
34,563,"Feb 9 2007	A Nice Little Reprieve!	We ended up booking at the John Howard very last-minute as our previous Expedia reservation got messed-up when a contract change resulted in our included breakfast becoming &quot;un-included&quot; - so we switched hotels. The John Howard cost a bit more, even with the $300 credit Expedia threw in because of their mistake, but it was totally worth it! This is a lovely little hotel - aformer row home -- on a very quiet Kensignton street (right next door to Benny Hill's former home and very near Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall). Our nicely decorated twin room was extremely large, by European standards, as was the bathroom. The hotel was small, and quiet, which was nice. There was also an excellent buffet breakfast (hot AND cold items, even though we booked for a continental breakfast), and they would make omelets to order. The only downside was the fact that the hotel is not all that close to a tube stop, with Gloucester Road being a 7-to-10 minute walk. We did, however, find it convenient to catch the 70 bus just across the street, which takes you to right to South Kensington Underground! We also found a bus, feet from the hotel, to take us directly to Victoria Station, where we caught the Gatwick Express. All in all, a great hotel and I would highly recommend it to others!"
35,563,"Dec 4 2006 	All in all a pleasurable experience	I booked this hotel as part of an offer through Nectar and have to say that I don't regret it for an instant. After I'd made the booking I saw some of the other reviews and had some reservations, but in the end my worries were unjustified. The hotel is situated very close to the Royal Albert Hall and right beside Kensington Gardens. When we arrived we travelled into Gloucester Road tube station which took about 15 minutes to walk from with bags, but once we had our bearings it could be walked to with rushing in about 5 - 10 minutes. You also have the option during the day of getting off at Queensway and having a nice stroll across Broad Walk in Kensington Gardens which takes about 10 minutes. We arrived at 9pm and the staff were helpful and as an added extra I'd been moved up from a Queen room to a suite. For the three days of the trip we had the use of a large bedroom (particularly by London standards) with a huge bed; a good sized bathroom, a fully functioning kitchen and a large living area with a dining table and four chairs. Shops are nearby which means that should you need to, you can buy in supplies and cook your own food.The staff were helpful when we needed them; the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good and I actually had a great time in this hotel. I think people need to remember that this place is in central London - rooms are smaller there than other parts of the country and cost more - and that it has a 3 star rating. The decor is in need of an update, but to be honest I've never stayed at a hotel on account of what style of tiles are in the bathroom, or what the wallpaper's like. The place was clean, comfortable and when I needed to ask the staff for anything they were very helpful, which is all I want from a hotel."
36,563,"Nov 20 2006 	we were very lucky	we, a friend and I, stayed at the hotel for 5 days. we booked a twin room but we got an upgrading and got a suite. It was a little bit old but very big and comfortable. Breakfast was very good, comparing with some other hotels in London that I've been to. Location it's very convenient if you want to be in a quite neighbourhood and near the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park."
37,563,"Nov 10 2006 	Not worth it at all	I wish I had read the reviews here before my husband and I booked. We wanted a romantic weekend away, and booked a Junior Suite for about 200 pounds a night. We saw other options, which were really nice but in the end we choose the John Howard. I feel we really wasted our hard-earned money. The rooms are so dated, really cheap looking and tacky. The suite was small and poorly laid out, and there was absolutely nothing luxurious about the place. We were so disappointed, and would highly recommend anyone not to go there. Next time, we'll use this site as a reference first!"
38,563,"Sep 25 2006 	Terrible..........	We booked this hotel using our nectar points and paid 90.00 and used quite a few nectar points to boot. We have stayed here previously and had a good experience however, on this occasion it was appalling. When we arrived at 2pm (on-time) the receptionist couldn't find our booking - even though we had booked and paid nearly a month previously. As she couldn't find it she gave us the key to a twin room but I said &quot;no had definately booked a double room&quot; so she then gave us the key to an apartment. We went up to the apartment and unpacked our belongings and freshened up. The telephone then rang and it was the receptionist who said she had made a mistake and we could not stay in the apartment. I told her that we had unpacked all our things but she just repeated that she was sorry but we could not stay in that room. So we packed all our things back in our suitcase and went to reception. She assured us that she would sort out a double room for us and it would be ready on our return with our suitcase in it.As we were attending a friends wedding we had to leave and trusted her to be true to her word. However, upon our return we were given the key to a twin room but not only that when we went to the room it absolutely stank and I mean REEKED of smoke. It literally hit you as you walked in the room. The night porter was rude and unfriendly and didn't want to know.The next morning (after feeling sick most of the night because of the smell) we went to breakfast first as the receptionist was busy. There were no glasses for juice.... no plates for the food.... no teaspoons on cups..... and very difficult to get any waiters as they kept disappearing into the kitchen ....... All in all the service was appalling.When I complained about her taking advantage as she knew she wouldn't be there upon our return and had noT sorted out the booking as promised she just apologised and that was that. I could live with the fact that it is a long walk to any tube station if the hotel itself was any good but I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.Ironically we had other friends who stayed for this weekend and had good experiences in their hotels so I recommend that you shop around for another hotel if you are staying in London after all there is enough to choose from. Friends of ours stayed at a hotel for 125 (only 35.00 more than us) and did not have to use up any nectar points into the bargain and stayed in a lovely clean hotel with a swimming pool etc and excellent service. This was The Grange in Holborn and not very far from the tube station. Also, another friend stayed on one of the special weekend packages in the Hilton which was not much more than we paid and were also pleased.I hope you find this review useful!"
39,563,"Aug 17 2006	total crap hotel	dont arrive on time or early your room or apartment will not be ready. The staff are very matter of fact and if you have a baby or two dont go there because their lifts dont take more than 2 people at a squeeze, it tight to get a buggy and 1 person in the lift. In the apartment we stayed in it is not like the photo on their web site so dont be fooled. The kitchen is dirty handles missing off the cupboards and the glasses are dirty as well. It is very dated and old looking and why is there a drain plug in the middle of the bathroom floor next to the bath!!. When we got into the apartment on the 3rd floor after having to go through 3 fire doors and down 2 steps and a lift ride we found it very uninviting and old and dirty. Dont sit in the arm chair your [--] will hit the floor and make sure you wash everything first!!. There was some sort of stains on the bedroom wall and my babys cot had to be propped against the wall in case it tipped over(nice)!!!!. The following day the marks were cleaned off the wall and the flat looked as though it had been cleaned a little better but not how i would have liked it, maybe i expect a little to much but at 235 a night for a 2 bedroom apartment which is dirty dated and very hot (no air con ) I wish i had found somewhere better. There is not downstairs seating area aparts from 3 chairs, no day time bar and only room service available till the bar etc opens. All in all i would not use this hotel or any in its chain again due to its poor standards and if you are visiting from the usa canada etc this is not what the uk is about!! we have a good selection of hotels so search about. And on an ending note the floor boards above us make so much noise every time the family came back above us that we couldnt hear the television and when they went home on the thursday morning we were woken at 4.00am by the noise of their kids running around and shouting etc I could have gone up there and had a go!!!!!"
40,563,"Aug 6 2006 	A Lovely hotel~~	After my disappointed 3 nights stay in the marriott hotel regent park, me&amp;my husband moved into john howard and it is a warm comfortable small B&amp;B, traditional british style and I love it. Price was 94 pounds include tax but no breakfast. The room I stayed was a double bedroom, with spacious and sparkling clean bathroom, mini bar and kettle. The cleaning lady should give her a star because she makes sure everything tidy up even my teddy bear. Free WIFI internet service, another star. (marriott charged me 15.99pound per day.) Situated in central london, close to knightbridge, all high end shops are there. But the down side is that the double bed was actually putting 2 single bed together, which is a bit uncomfy. There is no porter in hotel, so be prepared that you need to carry your luggages.1. Nearest tube station is gloucester road, about 10 mins walk. but in-between there are pubs &amp; resturants which serve good food, and waitrose supermarket just next to the exit of tube station.2. There is indian resturant in Montana hotel near the tube station, decoration very nice and taste yummy (46pound lunch for 2) but the service was not so good (been told loudly they need to close soon but still have half an hour left)3. Kensington park is nearby and you can picnic and feed the ducks in the pond.4. A very elegant bar just opposite the hotel, situated in the Gore hotel, excellent service and cheap. I will definitely stay in john howard again, for this quailty and spacious room, it is a bargain compare to other hotels in london."
41,563,"Jul 31 2006 	Good hotel great location	We chose the John Howard for our stay on 29th July as it's just round the corner from the Albert Hall, where we had tickets to the Proms. We paid 100 for a double room, but we were upgraded to a 2-bed suite, which was spacious for central London, although a little worn-looking in places. There was plenty of storage and the beds were comfortable. We were very grateful for the air con, although this was only in the living room. The area is fairly quiet at night, and it felt safe strolling back from the (fabulous!) concert. It's very convenient for the South Ken museums and Hyde Park, and plenty of street parking in the area. Minor problems were that the room wasn't ready when we arrived, the staff were ok but a little disinterested and the breakfast (12.50 per person extra) was extensive but fairly bland. Overall though, with such a great location, we were very happy with this hotel. Difficult to comment on value for money as we didn't see the room we paid for, but we'd stay there again, although we'd probably eat breakfast elsewhere."
42,563,"Jul 25 2006	Good deal ;)	I have a bit of an odd story to tell. I and two friends decided to try to get a suite in this hotel for just one night, just for the fun of it. So we went there and one of my friends went to the reception and discussed prices with them. After about 10 minutes he came out and we had a 2 story suite for no more than 200 pounds. So the staff is not just helpful, I can say they have a good bit of humor there. The room was outstanding, 2 bathrooms, and a living room. It needs a little redoing tho, but we couldn't really complain. Of course the room had all comforts you could ever wish for. So if you're planning a crazy night in London and you don't take fright of negotiang a price, this is the place to go."
43,563,"Jun 20 2006	Good value quiet neighborhood	We originally booked at the Best Western Phoenix; however, we were re-located to the Best Western John Howard. The transporation to the hotel was free and the staff was very accomodating. Although farther from the Tube, The Kensington location is quieter and seems more upscale. The staff at the John Howard were very kind. The room was spotless and the breakfast was on par with a European Hotel breakfast buffet. Our triple room was large but needs updating. The air-conditioner worked very well and was greatly appreciated."
44,563,"May 15 2006	Good value but needs updating	We stayed in a two bedroom apartment. It was very spacious and worked well for the five of us recovering from jet lag. However, the apartment was very worn and needs a lot of updating. It was also a bit too far from a tube station if you want to see more of the typical tourist attractions. It is close to some museums and to Kensington Gardens. The staff was fairly friendly and the buffet breakfast was great. Make sure you ask for special prices with breakfast included, otherwise breakfast is an additional 12 pounds each. We paid 239 pounds a night for the apartment, including breakfast for 3 adults and 2 children."
45,563,May 2 2006	Exceeded all expectations	We unfortunately only spent one night at the hotel but were extremely impressed especially after experiencing some other 'hospitality' London hotels had to offer. The John Howard Hotel exceeded our expectations in bed size and comfort. The rooms had more than enough space for two large open suitcases and the bathroom was excellent. A glass shower curtain would however be a suggestion. Room service was prompt and friendly. The reception staff spoke perfect English and were professional from the time we checked in to us leaving luggage and booking us an airport taxi long after we'd checked out. Definitely recommended.
46,563,"Apr 20 2006	Great location great accommodation	Just to let you families out there know that it does not need to cost the earth to visit London. We stayed in one of this lovely hotels apartments, which gave us the flexability to cook for our family of 5 without breaking the bank on London restauant prices. However we did treat ourselves to a meal in the hotel restuarant which was excellent and very good value for money at around 11.00 for a set 3 course meal. The location was excellent for us as it is within walking distance from the Natural History museum, Science museum and The Royal Victoria and Albert museum (all of which have free entry) Also across the road in Hyde Park our children really enjoyed the Diana memorial playground complete with priate ship, sand, water, swings tents and again all for free. The hotel is also next to the Royal Albert Hall so I have already planned our next trip the John Howard, but this time we shall leave the children behind and maybe spash out on a suite.. All in all a great location and excellent value for money. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel"
47,563,"Apr 8 2006	Convenient location	A 2 night stay, to visit the Royal Albert Hall to see Katherine Jenkins (Wow!). Superb location for museums and Harrods, used Hop on Tour bus to see London, (www.bigbustours.com). Hotel rooms at rear are quiet, clean and to a good standard. Breakfast was plentiful, but eat out in evenings so not sure of standard of restaurant. Will definately use again for location and quietness. Staff were very polite and helpfull."
48,563,Mar 30 2006	Good experience	Our room was quite spacious with a nice sized bathroom. The decor is a bit outdated but the room was kept very clean. Staff: very friendly and helpful. Location: very good to bus route and o.k. to tube station. Very nice neighbourhood for walking around. Will stay at this hotel again.
49,563,"Mar 26 2006	did not get value for money would not stay again.	my daughter and I stayed at John Howard for one night as we were going to a show at the Albert Hall.When booking we asked for a TWIN room eg. 2 beds but were annoyed to find we had a double bed after I had asked several times on booking to make sure we had a twin room!The hotel is not as appealing as it looks in the brochure. some of the fixtures in the room were quite dirty. and we could not evan close the bathroom door let alone lock it! the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was good ,but I would not stay there again as have stayed in much better hotels in the past in london."
50,563,"Mar 5 2006	Room and breakfast not up to scratch	I stayed here one night to visit an evening function in the Albert Hall for which the location is extremely convenient.I had a double room up on the third floor which was well appointed and spacious.Overall it was clean and comfortableBut...- when I entered the room the light in the hallway area didn't work so I had to feel my way round to the bedroom.- in the bathroom a dirty teeshirt left by a previous guest was left hanging on the back of the door- breakfast which cost about 15 was very unsatisfactory. Not appetising, including some inedible sausages. Very poor value for money"
51,563,"Feb 27 2006	Superior Hotel Accomodation	27th February 2006For several years we have really enjoyed many overnight stays at The John Howard Hotel and if our future goes according to plan we hope to have many more. The reason we first booked into the J.H. was because we are frequent visitors to the worldwide renowned Royal Albert Hall. The J.H. is conveniently closely situated to the Hall. We are able to leave an evening concert and within 2  3 minutes be back into our hotel room or apartment. On entering The John Howard we have always found the reception staff very friendly, co-operative and helpful. When being shown to our room or apartment, via the lifts, we appreciate the absence of long corridors with many little identical rooms leading from them. Each room or apartment at the J.H. is an individual and always found to be very clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped. A very substantial English breakfast is included, or if preferred, a lighter comprehensive continental breakfast is also provided. The John Howard, No.4. Queens Gate is also conveniently situated near to other places of interest. Hyde Park is just yards away, Kensington Palace 5 minutes. walk through the park, Kensington High Street 5 minutes walk and has many shops and restaurants . In the other direction 8 Minutes walk to Exhibition Road with all the museums including The Victoria and Albert. Further on, still within walking distance, Knightsbridge and Harrods. We have been pleased to use the buses for trips to other popular attractions. Travelling on buses is very economical. There is a very frequent service and the bus stops are only a minute away from the John Howard Hotel."
52,563,"Feb 23 2006	Doesn't look like the brochure.	I stayed in this hotel for one night as I was going to see a show at the Royal Albert Hall.I found the reception staff to be very helpful and polite. We recieved a very warm welcome.I had booked a one bedroom apartment but on arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom apartment. Everything good so far!!We made our way up to the room and I was so disappointed when I opened the door. When I has viewed the rooms on the internet they looked very regal, romantic and cosy. The main reception room of the apartment was so drab with dreary curtains and a horrid carpet. It was not sumptious as was portrayed on the net. The kitchen was adequate but the cutlery was dirty so we ate out.The whole apartment was reasonably clean but very basic.The receptionist did recommend a fab itailian restaurant though.I would not stayin this hotel again as there are so many others in the near vicinity."
53,563,"Feb 22 2006	Great for a family	My husband and two children stayed there on our way back from Italy. We were booked in Room 6 and 7 that were interconnecting rooms. This was great since it gave us all the space we needed as well having the family all in the same place.The Children particularly enjoyed the breakfast and the close proximity to Kensington Park.Great staff and honestly a great place to stay in London. There are some fabulous apartments for long stay and had we been staying longer in London, we would have certainly booked one of these apartments that comes with its only fully equipped kitchen.You can't go wrong by staying at the John Hooward Hotel"
54,563,"Feb 20 2006	Girls alone	Travelling on business alone, I found the hotel extremely accommodating. The staff were friendly without being gushy. Room service extremely quick and efficient. The room very comforatable, especially fab white cotton sheets! Lovely entrance to sit and read papers in. Breakfast predictable but delicious. Would highly recommend it, especially women on own. Fab location, extremely handy for everything. Loved the walk in the park and the close proximity to Harvey Nicks and Sloane Street. Obviously I didn't have that much time to shop as I was there on business!!! Taxi from KX about 18. But Glouster Road tube very handy. Stay there you will love it!"
55,563,"Apr 13 2005 	Great room good location	We stayed for three nights in a room in the back of the ground floor that had a large window looking out on an amazingly quiet alley. Our room was the largest that we've encountered in London, including a hallway with ample closets and a large bathroom with fullsize bathtub and lots of counter space. The room was decorated in shades of peach and light blue and had a small table, desk, and two chairs. It was a very pleasant space. The staff was friendly and helpful.The hotel is equidistant from three tube stops (Kensington, South Kensington, and Gloucester Road) although each is a 5-10 minute walk. Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park is a block away, and the Victoria &amp; Albert and Science Museums are very close by.Three blocks from the hotel, on the Gloucester Road, is a small group of shops and restaurants, including Jakobs deli with delicious food. Further down Gloucester Road, near the Tube stop, is a large Waitrose grocery store with a lot of prepared food. There are also shops and restaurants on Kensington High Street.One disadvantage of staying in this part of town is that many of the prime tourist attractions are not within walking distance. If you are visiting Imperial College or the Royal Colleges of Art or Music, this is a good place to stay.I would definitely stay at the John Howard again."
56,563,"Mar 30 2005	good choice	We were in England 3/12-22/05 and stayed at the John Howard for the last 7 nights of our visit and were very happy with our stay at this hotel. We were in a room on the ground floor which was a very nice room. The room itself was just as large as some of the 4 and 5 star hotel rooms we've stayed in in the USA and Canada and the bathroom was very modern. We found the hotel to be a charming smaller hotel with clean rooms, nicely decorated lobby, friendly helpful staff and it had a nice a restaurant downstairs with good dinners and friendly waitpeople. We ate there twice and were impressed with our dinners. The breakfast was included in our last 3 days charge and they were good but I would not pay for them separately because I thought they were too high when you converted the pound into US money. I can't eat that much for what the cost would have been. The staff were very friendly and helpful to us. The only thing I did not like was the fact that you had to pay for internet service (this was free at the prior hotel), you had to pay a pound for each local call and my husband was charged for a cup of coffee (I believe 2.50 pounds or $5)while we were waiting to check in. These really were the only complaints I had about the hotel. We were within a block of Kensington Park, the bus line and it was not that far a walk to catch the tube (maybe 15 mins for the closest one). I thought the area we were in was very nice (South Kensington) and it seemed safe (we were out walking late in the evening). It was not that far of a walk to get to a lot of sights around the area either or to the downtown part if you liked to walk. I would stay at this hotel again in the future and in fact intend to if we return to London. You really have to watch the internet for a good rate as the dollar is so weak. As far as the cost (and this is based on the room we had only) it was comparible to some of the same size rooms we've stayed in here at home and in Canada. My girlfriend had a single room on the fifth floor and I think she was way overcharged for what she got but not us. Anyway I would recommend this hotel to my friends and will stay there again."
57,563,"Mar 6 2005	Superior 3 Star	I like to stay in this part of town. The John Howard has a good (not great) location. It's a kinda sorta hike to either Gloucester Road Tube or Kensington High Street Tube. Six of one etc...Gloucester Road is the District Line, hence very convenient in an East/West kind of way. The Howard had some of the best rates ever for a hotel of this class.I was given a clean narrow fifth floor double suite with a small view of Queen's Gate, a well equipped kitchenette and a separate bath and hall. A double closet, a queensize bed, color TV, desk, chair and loveseat. Not a suite by American standards, but nevertheless, above average for a three star. The room a bit worn as was the bath, but amenities and maid service were of a good standard. Self controlled heat and plenty of hot water. Plenty of towels in the bath changed daily. The Express slipped under your door every morning was a welcome touch. The room quiet in spite of the proximity to the elevator. Desk staff were courteous. I didn't eat here, but I found the John Howard convenient and of a superior standard. Sixty quid a night for this level isn't at all bad. I'd return.Recommended."
58,563,"Mar 3 2005	Great Value in London	Just back from a four night stay at the John Howard Hotel in London. Our 72 pound per night rate for a room with a queen size bed and including breakfast for two was outstanding. As another reviewer writes, the rooms are not the most cheerful places, but were clean. Also, our stay was very quiet. The hotel is in a great location overall, though it is about a five to seven minute a walk to the tube. Near the tube station are restaurants, a full service grocery store, and a convienance store that it is open late. Also, make sure if you plan to arrive by tube, that you have good directions to get to the hotel. There are only two turns, but with streets not labeled as prominently as other places, it is important to have good directions.The staff was mostly helpful, though they are not native Londoners. If you need detailed touring information, you will need to look elsewhere. The high speed internet access was down frequently and is very expensive. Not a big deal with so many other places offering cheap access. Overall, the hotel is in a great location, has nice clean rooms with larger beds, and was for us a great value. The breakfast and dining staff were excellent. What keeps it from getting an &quot;excellent&quot; rating from us is the slightly worn rooms and distance to the tube and food options. We would go back to the hotel in a minute!"

3,564,"Nov 14 2009 	An alternative to a London based hotel	My friend &amp; I stayed at this hotel 3 times during our time in UK/Ireland/Europe. The first time we stayed there which was only for one night the shower in the room would not work so we were moved to the &quot;Wimbledon&quot; suite which was so much better &amp; larger than the older style, smallish room we were in. On the 2nd occasion we were again only staying for one night &amp; we were given a room with a double bed despite my e-mails to the hotel that we were 2 female friends travelling together &amp; required twin beds. To the hotels credit even thought they had a huge wedding at the hotel they left my friend in the double room &amp; I was given a single room in the loft of the hotel - lots of stairs however it was a very well appointed room which had obviously just been recently renovated. On the 3rd occassion we were staying for 5 nights &amp; we were given a twin executive room which was very nicely decorated however it was very compact for 2 women who had been travelling for a number of weeks &amp; accumulated quite a bit of baggage. Our motivation for staying at this hotel was that my friend's daughter lives in Putney &amp; staying at this hotel instead of in London itself enabled us to be closer to her. It did mean more travelling when we wanted to go &amp; see anything that was in London however Putney was such a nice place &amp; the hotel was welcoming despite the fact that it is a maze of corridors &amp; staircases going all over the place &amp; getting to your room with luggage without a lift is a real challenge but it has beautiful gardens &amp; having breakfast each moring looking out onto the garden was so relaxing &amp; was a beautiful way start to the day. The hotel is within walking distance of some delightful pubs &amp; restaurants equal to anything in London itself."
4,564,"Oct 5 2009 	Good service but very small room	We stayed at the Lodge hotel for a week in September 2009 as some friends were getting married in Putney. Location-wise, the hotel is in a pleasant, leafy part of town although it is situated on a main road (however we did not hear any traffic noise). It's 5 minutes walk to East Putney tube, 12 minutes walk to Putney station and 20 minutes walk to Putney Bridge tube. Alternatively, it's a 5 minute walk the other way into Wandsworth town centre. Lots of good pubs, restaurants etc within 10 mins walk.The hotel is impressive from the outside and the communal areas are good, especially the conservatory restaurant and the lovely garden out the back where I spent several hours writing my best man's speech! The breakfast is not bad, a good selection of English &amp; continental with fruit, croissants, yoghurts and the usual bacon, eggs etc. The service was also good, both the reception and wait staff were efficient and friendly.Although I knew I was getting a small room, I was a little disappointed with what we got (room 16). A classic English shoebox, it certainly will not be playing host to the National Cat Swinging championships any time soon and should be avoided by claustrophobes. The room was comfortable enough, the bed was OK and the bathroom, though tiny, was fully functional. However we did have a few gripes:1. Storage space was limited and it was a struggle to find room to store all of our belongings2. We were on the ground floor with a window leading out to a fire escape route so we could not leave the window open during the day which meant the room got very hot (and it was only 19-20 degrees outside)3. About two thirds of the channels on the TV did not work (including ITV, C4 and Five)4. The walls are paper thin and the room is under the stairs going up to the next level so it was very noisy at timesIn summary, the Lodge is a good hotel but I reckon it is probably worth paying the extra to get a better and bigger room.Finally, a few hot tips for prospective guests:1. There is free broadband internet in the lounge2. If you don't like the look of the scrambled eggs at breakfast, ask for poached - we had them every day and they were cooked to perfection each time3. The hotel runs a special offer with Virgin Active gym 10mins down the road (towards Putney) - 7.50 for a day's use of all facilities, well worth it"
5,564,"Oct 2 2009 	Worth every penny	I spent 2 days in this hotel in August, u know what i received an exceptional service,a very clean room Really recommend it."
6,564,"Sep 21 2009 	Rip off Hotel	I paid 246 for an executive room the first room they gave me was filthy, wallpaper comeing off walls etc. Room48. They then moved me to another reovated room it was very nice had a normal size double bed, no trouser press, but the ac worked.The dwn side was the other rooms were still being renovated there was nothing on their web site to say work was going on, i had been up from 4 in the morning and had flown into London, i was very tired and wanted to get some sleep in the afternoon, no chance the decorators made sure off that. I asked if the workmen would be there on saturday morning the person on reception didnt know ( she had blond hair and was not very friendly), So in the morning hopeing to get a bit off a lay in again no chance banb drll bang. i asked to be moved and they said they would move me at noon, but when they rang to tell me the new room was ready i was to tired to re pack and move, maybe when they get the work done it will be better, oh they also took money to pay for the room before i arrived from my maestro card how they did this i do not know, as i had given them different card details. You may hav e a lovely time in the honey moon suite but as for the rest, i will not go there again, friends stayed at the Premier Inn Putney will go there next year."
7,564,"Sep 14 2009 	AN AMAZING HOTEL WITH FANTASTIC SERVICE	My wife and I recently had our wedding at this establishment. After searching several areas in south west London my wife came across The Lodge Hotel Putney. From our first meeting with the hotel Manager Alberto, he helped us plan, manage and above was dedicated to givig us the wedding of our dreams. The day of the wedding was fantastic the service that we received was first class. The staff were extreamly helpfull and we received so many compliments on how beautiful the rooms were. The hotel also boasts one of the most elegant and colorful gardens a fantastic place for pictures. The dinner that was served was one of the best that I have had. The hotel also offers a bar that allowing visitors to grab a quick drink or sit and relax with friends. My wife and I stayed in the Bridal Suite and were amazed at the clasy and modern room with modern 32 inch flat screens and most importantly soft and comfortable beds that allow you to drift off to sleep. The bathroom in our room was clean, modern and well presented. Overall this is a hotel that I would recommend to my friends and family. The staff and management are very helpful, the rooms and facilities are clean and imaculate and I dare say one of Putney's hidden treasures!"
8,564,"Sep 13 2009 	A Real Let Down	My husband and I chose this hotel because it was located near to family who live in Putney. There was very little choice in this area otherwise I think I would have packed and left. We had been travelling in Europe for a month and this was our last stop before heading home after spending some time with family. We were given a very small, cramped and somewhat smelly room that lead off an interior corridor that was obviously an add on. There was no ventilation as the small windown opened out only onto the corridor whcich did not have access to fresh air. The room was extremely hot and stuffy and very unwelcoming at the end of a long day. There was no A/C which where I come from has been standard in this type of hotel for more than 30 years. Disgraceful and very unhealthy. It would not pass health regulations in Oz. No way. The staff with very few exceptions were indifferent. The only saving grace was the breakfast and this was very expensive. The cafe across the road did a better one and a third the price. We needed medication to be kept in a refrigerator and the desk staff did so even though it appeared to be an inconvenience to them and they were doing us a favour, especially one particular woman who was very rude and appeared to be a supervisor. I am reluctant to be so negative with reviews but this place was very below par and would be classified as a one star in Oz. Never again. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."
9,564,"Aug 30 2009 	Great staff really good service.	Great service form everyone from bartender to waitresses. Friendly and curtious. Very high standard breakfast, plentiful and tasty. Must be a very good chef and kitchens.  Only downside for us was the standard room which was very small and not suitable for a double room. Silly things like TV on top of small wardrobe, Kettle having to stay on floor as only able to plug in under desk. No air con and room too hot. Skylight window did let in cool air but also noise and could not black out as blind build in window. Shower was tiny and shower head sprayed water in all directions. In morning shower was cold and even left on for 10 minutes still stone cold. It worked night before. Other family member had &quot;luxury room&quot; which I would have thought was just an ordinary room but it was fine and every thing worked ok and very nice bathroom. Would stay again but would check what room I was in. Defiantly dont stay on the top floor. Internet PC in lounge was good. Parking was excellent. Reasonable level of cleanleness."
10,564,"Aug 12 2009 	clean decent place	I enjoyed my stay here at best western lodge hotel, staff where very friendly and sociable. They where able to tell me a bit about the local area. Food was excellent and was checked up on to make sure that everything was ok.However if you are situated at the top floor expect to be very hot. You will only be provided with a tiny office fan to try keep you cool and when coming to the middle of summer that was not brilliant. Some rooms have air con but mine unfortunatly didnt. My room was very cramped and also had no spare plug sockets to put my laptop into however I just unplugged the lamp and I was fine!Beds where nicely made and clean ready to get in. You could certainly relax here."
11,564,"Aug 7 2009 	A good base away from London	Stayed here recently as we were visiting friends in Putney, rather than have them come all the way into london. This hotel - two Edwardian-style houses merged together - is about a 3 minute walk away from Putney East tube station on the District line, which was good news. First room we got - No.41 - was a bit unclean and the guy in the room upstairs woke us up at 1am and 4am due to him walking across badly creaking floorboards, so avoid this room. We asked for a change next day and got room 14, which is down by the restaurant.The restaurant is a conservatory and lovely and bright. Breakfast was a self-serve and plentiful, with plenty of cearals, too. And good coffee! The staff are mainly Spanish/portuguese and a couple of Polish girls who are all very friendly. The little Indian/Tamil guy on the bar at night is more interested in the footy and chatting up the receptionists than tending his bar, though.We liked it that much that we stayed another night at even less than we booked it on Superbreak.com!! When your there, on Upper Richmond Road, do try the Italian deli just before the tube station and keep away from the Tj Mahal curry house further down on the other side - I got the sh**s from just a starter!!"
12,564,"Jun 16 2009 	Fantastic Meeting Venue and Incredibly Helpful Staff	Further to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to thank you once more for an excellent day at the Lodge Hotel. I was an independent facilitator brought in by London Borough of Wandsworth to facilitate their away day.I was incredibly impressed by the facilities made available to us (the conservatory was fantastic) which really contributed to the success of the day. The meal and refreshments throughout the day were fantastic. I would like to particularly acknowledge the efforts of your staff team. Every staff member who came into the room was polite and welcoming, always saying hello and enquiring if I/we needed anything further and making every effort to ensure that our time with you was enjoyable. Indeed, nothing was too much trouble  I was most grateful that the team even provided a cable for my computer as mine had been lost.Please pass on my thanks to you team  they do a fantastic job (I deliver customer care training so I know how important it is!!) and have certainly given me a fantastic impression of The Lodge Hotel. I will definitely be recommending your hotel in the future"
13,564,"Jun 5 2009 	Good rooms good position great service!	I recently arranged an international sales conference at the Lodge Hotel for my company, and was very impressed by the way they handled everything. We had just under 30 attendee's and around 25 stayed in the hotel. The staff are excellent and most importantly very accommodating with any requests and changes that you may need during your stay. The meeting rooms were good and the airconditioning was welcomed considering the warm weather we experienced during the week we were there. I was fortunate enough to stay in a Luxury Room which is very well appointed and of a great size if compared to other hotels in London. If you are going to stay at the hotel ask for a renovated room - this is a big improvement over the older style rooms! One main complaint was that the hotel was extremely warm and so was the room I was staying in (room 54). If only they had airconditioning it would be perfect!! I mentioned this to the manager and he explained that they are working on it (it is apparently caused by the plumbing pipes, which are being changed at the moment). On the last night I moved to Room 15 (unscheduled extra night) and was very pleasantly surprised by how cool it was, and how well it was decorated (renovated room). To be honest, there was not much difference to the Luxury Room and it was much cooler on the bottom floor, if a little noisy!In general, we had only one (extremely fussy) delegate move hotels, and the rest were very happy. It has a good location, and is close to East Putney Tube Station which will take you straight into London or out to Wimbledon (great place!). I would certainly stay there again!"
14,564,"Jun 5 2009 	disappointing location noisy and overpriced	OK, so this is London (just about) and we're all supposed to accept that only a rancid mattress under a railway bridge comes in at under 100 but ... this hotel still represents poor value. If the location was great then there'd be some payoff for lack of staff, small and soulless rooms with tiny bathrooms, thin walls and noisy corridors (why not clad your sixteen hundred interconnecting doors so they don't constantly bang?). But the location *isn't* great - on a busy road away from the centre of Putney. So ... if you need to be in Putney for an event, stick to the inconvenience of cabbing or tubing and stay in a hotel in the city proper."
15,564,"Apr 3 2009 	Would not stay here again	I recently stayed at this hotel on business. I stayed there for 2 nights, on the first day I left my room only to return to find that an item of clothing was missing. The hotel have not been helpful infact they have just dismissed the incident. This is now in the hands of the police, as a loan female its very unnerving to know someone has been in your room whilst you've been out."
16,564,Feb 26 2009 	Great little hotel	Great little hotel. Had wimbledon suite for 2adults + 2kids. Fine sized family room with 2 single beds + 1 king sized bed/tea/coffee making facilities/hairdryer/v comfy beds. 3 little steps down to bathroom which was compact but spotless &amp; had everything we needed. Just beside east putney tube station + somerfield minimarket just down the road where we got all our necessities. Fine clean small hotel and would most definitely stay there again &amp; would highly recommend to anybody.
17,564,"Jan 7 2009	first class	stayed in this hotel for a weekend break with my family.we came up from manchester.staff was first class,food was first class, great location. we have stayed in many hotels in london this was the best. we will be back."
18,564,"Nov 11 2008 	Great place to stay	My stay was a pleasant experience, the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast foods were always fresh and good . The staff was very warm and friendly and willing to help if I had any questions. I would love to stay there again."
19,564,"Sep 22 2008 	Excellent hotel lovely staff	My mum and I stayed at the Lodge while attending the Davis Cup at Wimbledon. We arrived early and our room wasn't quite ready but the staff kept our luggage so we could go to the tennis. When we got back to the hotel we received an executive twin room (even though we had only booked a standard twin) Room and ensuite were lovely and very clean, beds were very comfortable. As we had had a long day we decided to order room service for dinner, food arrived quickly and was delicious, nice touch was receiving the dessert separately so the ice cream didn't melt while we were eating our main meal. Breakfast in the morning was lovely and served in a conservatory that while you were in you wouldn't believe you were in London. Again staff were very helpful and friendly and made you feel at ease. On check out everything was straight forward and bill was exactly as expected. We arrived back at the hotel well before our car was due and the staff made us feel welcome as we sat in the lounge waiting on our car. A very nice hotel, and the staff made our trip very enjoyable."
20,564,"Aug 30 2008 	Best Wstern Lodge Hotel	Stayed here as a base for London sightseeing. Tube station a short walk. Nice apparently safe residential area. Family room is the upper floor of a converted garage. The entire hotel is a converted house. It has three separate rooms: a main room with two beds, a second bedroom with a single bed that is also the passageway to the bathroom. No A/C - it got a little warm. Good for travelling with teenagers. All rooms were a good size and clean. Helpful staff. Free parking. Free computer in the lobby for internet browsing. The only reason for the lower overall rating is the price but it wasn't too bad for the location."
21,564,"Aug 25 2008 	Misleading website.	After looking on the web at many hotels with qiuck access to Earls Court,i plumped for the Lodge hotel,with the offer of free parking being one of main draws.The hotels website paints a really excellent picture.However,i can also agree with the last review.As i approached the hotel i instantly thought what a mistake i had made.I arrived late so really didnt want to waste any more time looking for somewhere else.The hotel does indeed look very shabby from the outside...paint peeling off everywhere.The reception looks okay but my room was awful at best.All the rooms have been recently refurbished according to the website with guests receiving luxury accomodation.When they say RECENTLY, i take it that they mean in the last twenty years.The carpet in my room was threadbare,the bed lumpy and the bathroom had very old fittings which were also dirty.The one saving grace for this hotel is the nice breakfast room.Its a pity that the rest of the hotel hasnt had as much thought spent on it.The last time i was in London i booked the Holiday Inn in Brentford which was excellent and 30 cheaper.I cant believe that i didnt go for this one again...you live and learn.I paid 100 for a double room for me and my son...even he asked if we could swap to a more modern hotel and he is only 10 years old.I know that by London rates that 100 is probably a good deal but by this hotels standard i would want a week for that."
22,564,"Aug 14 2008 	Would not recommend The Lodge Hotel Putney	This was the nearest hotel to a wedding we attended. After I checked it out on the website. It looked lovely and to the standard that I usually go for at a price that I would expect to pay out of the city.When we drove up I nearly died it looked shabby on the outside, the receiption looked OK so I was hopefull the room lived up to the webpage. It didnt. It was old, shabby, crampt. The onsuite was top clean, but the shower head was dirty after a good scrub with the medical stuff I had, I decided it was to dangerous for me to shower having an open wound. I would have checked out the min I saw the room but I was with other guests, and I couldn't leave them alone. I looked at there rooms and it was the same in them. I feel was deceived by the standard shown on the webpage. On the plus side, the breakfast was nice. The Staff very nice. Its close to the East Putney Tube."
23,564,"Jul 20 2008 	Excellent Attentive Staff	Recently had the pleasure of a short weekend break at the hotel, where we were looked after by Alberto and his team in an efficient and friendly manner. Food and decoration of a good standard with improvement continuing on an ongoing basis. The only minor drawback was the variance in water temperature whilst running the shower, and we understand this will be rectified during the next month or two when the local water authority replace old pipes and improve the existing water pressure."
24,564,"Jun 25 2008 	hell hole	stayed during wimbledon week, got a box sized room, no aircon, leave window open to hear dulcet tones of police sirens, shower a massive 14&quot;square, ok if you like your nose pressed against the wall and shower curtain stuck to your back. tea making facilities kept in wardrobe, milk and cream were off, not that you could make a drink, no kettle. glad someone else paid the 110 per night, i thought it was a total rip off, travel lodge a far better bet, still you could sit on toilet and wash your feet in the sink at same time, quiet a novelty in a modern hotel"
25,564,"May 28 2008 	Excellent for visiting London	We needed to visit central London for a couple of day's and wanted to take our car as we were travelling elswhere after our stay. Considering that many London hotels do not have parking or charge considerably, plus the Congestion Charge it was one of the main reasons why we chose The Lodge with it's free parking. Access to central London is really easy, but very crowded if you travel at commuter times. However the tube station is less that 5 minutes walk away. The hotel itself is very bright and modern, and our room facing the front onto the main road was very good and exceptionally clean. Though the hotel is on the main A205 South Circular, but at night it was relatively quiet. As others have mentioned, breakfast is served in a lovely conservatory overlooking gardens and I cannot fault the quality of food or service by any of the staff throughout. There is also a free Computer in the lounge if you need it. Yes, a good hotel and a convenient location. Try the Youngs Brewery website if you like pub food, we ate at the Boathouse overlooking the river and the Queen Adelaide, both about 10 minutes walk away, both offering qood service and good food."
26,564,"Apr 21 2008 	a nice hotel to stay	My husband and I stayed at the hotel for the whole weekend. We had a pleasant time during the stay. The reception staff were so courteous and helpful that we were very impressed on our arrival. The room we stayed was a spacious double room, nice and clean, overlooking a lovely garden. I just loved it! Definitely worth trying"
27,564,"Apr 16 2008 	A delightful alternative	Being a frequent traveller to london on business tends to be throughly depressing, checking into inpersonal chained hotels e.g. hilton, travel lodge...e.t.c. I find the Lodge Hotel to be a delightful alternative to such places. The welcoming and atentive staff made a trip to london not such a chore, even though the hotel was clearly busy, while i relaxed at the bar the staff were friendly and effcient. The area itself is quieter than central london although there was still a number of great places to eat and at the end of the road was the tube. My room was clean and spacious with a compfy bed and all the ameinties i required for my nights stay. I would highly recommend a stay."
28,564,"Apr 16 2008 	Convenient and Classy Putney Hotel	My stay at The Lodge Hotel was excellent value. The location can't be beat - so close to the Underground - with access to Central London in just a few minutes. Wimbledon is even closer. The hotel has all the features and amenities you could hope for, whether for conferences or a London holiday. The rooms are clean, the showers and bathrooms are modern and with excellent water pressure. The common rooms are attractive and well-presented. While the hallways and layout of the building are a bit quirky, it just serves as a reminder that you're staying somewhere unique - not some soulless block hotel with runway corridors. But special notice must go to the breakfast room, a lovely glass conservatory at the back of the hotel where the full English breakfast is always well-prepared. A very nice way to start the day. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning the next time I need a hotel near London."
29,564,"Apr 9 2008 	Very Basic	This hotel was booked on my behalf. I had to change rooms as the first one very very dirty, second was better but still not very clean. My tip would be to only stay in one of there new rooms.It is only 3 star so did not expect much. Food in the bar is also very basic, but ok for a snack. Staff friendly and polite. Would not stay here again, too expensive for what you get."
30,564,"Apr 3 2008	A leaky lodge in Putney?	We stayed for a week at the Best Western and enjoyed our room overlooking the garden. There was a hole in the ceiling that seemed to indicate a leak that had never been properly patched. The breakfast fare was typical and never varied; however, the service was good but the coffee was terrible!! Judging from frayed tablecloths, a cracked coffee cup, and cracks in the glass panels of a hall door, I would say the hotel needs better maintenance beyond its glossy surface.We noticed and reported to desk staff a leak in the ceiling by the coke machine which was dripping water onto the carpet. This was not remedied until, 4 days later, when a pail was put out to catch the drops. Not a very professional solution to the problem. The desk staff was distant and not terribly helpful. I would definitely not advise this accommodation for anyone with a mobility impairment."
31,564,"Mar 24 2008 	Give Putney A Try !	Unless you enjoy the noise, grubbiness and tourist hordes that mob the streets of Earls Court and Kensington, think about branching out to a different London neighborhood for your next visit. Four of my friends were in town to see some football at Craven Cottage and Stamford Bridge. You couldn't beat the location of the BW Lodge in Putney. It's a simple walk or tube ride from there to those locations. The hotel itself is quite fine and the neighborhood is just that - real Londoners and real families.We chose to skip the food and drink at the hotel in favor of the local establishments - much cheaper and more enjoyable. Plenty of excellent pubs along or off the High Street. The Green Man is a real winner - take the bus up Putney Hill; it has its own stop. Great atmosphere and food."
32,564,"Jan 31 2008 	suprisingly good	Myself and my partner stayed here for 2 nights and although we had a small room in the eaves no 11 it was spotlessly clean we had a tea, coffee and biscuits tray , ironing board, hairdryer etc in fact everything you could want from a room on a short break.The staff were really helpfull and friendly and the breakfast was good and buffet style so that you could eat as much or as little as you chose, barman was really helpfull.I must say it was a very pleasant stay and the garden looks a lovely place to sit in if visiting in nicer weather.We wouldn't hesitate to stay again free parking is a bonus,3-4 mins walk to tube and short journey into town marvellous. Local restaurants are also good.Janie and Greg"
33,564,"Jan 28 2008 	Just about acceptable	If you want somewhere to get your head down, and in which you won't be spending much time, then this hotel is ok but if you are claustrophobic or expect to spend more than a couple of waking hours in your hotel room then this may not be the one for you.Having read some of the previous reviews, it may be that I was very unlucky with my room (50) but cannot believe there would be a huge difference between them. I could barely swing a cat, the tea and coffee making facilities were in (not on) the bedside table (presumably to save space, only found the morning after as it wasn't pointed out to us) and the en-suite was ridiculously small. We were in the eaves of the building and so not only was it a tiny room, but also had to contend with a sloping ceiling!On the plus side, the bar downstairs is very nice and the breakfast buffet had sufficient choice and quantity. Also the fact that it has a free car park is a huge plus and one of the major reasons we chose to stay here. Our friends who also stayed here, asked to change their room after the first night because a. it was so small and b. they were woken up for 4 hours with someone talking in the room next door. This is an old house with very thin walls so if you're a light sleeper - bring ear plugs!All in all, it served a purpose but I certainly wouldn't choose to stay here again."
34,564,"Dec 2 2007 	Perfect in Putney	What a great hotel! Its a long time since I received such helpful andcourteous service in and around London. The free parking was a good start; the room was perfect, well appointed, clean and comfortable with a light and airy feel. Following a good nights sleep the hearty and tasty breakfast went downa treat and was served by friendly and cheerful staff. I found the location to be spot on with good amenities, great restaurants and peaceful parks on the doorstep and close by in Putney and Richmond, all great and safe areas. Travel into the heart of London was quick and easy by tube, cab and car or only a short walk. I stayed for 2 nights/3 days on a business and pleasure trip, the hotel comfortably met the requirements for both. There is even a quietand well appointed garden area at the rear, a bit cold in November butwhen I return in summer its another reason to stay here again. Id definitely recommend this hotel, I checked out feeling completely happy to pay the exceptionally reasonable rates."
35,564,"Nov 30 2007 	Good place to stay	Had a pleasant stay at the Lodge Hotel in early November. The hotel was picked for its amenities and its proximity to Brixton, where a friend and I were going to two concerts. I had Room 48 -- a double on the top floor. Nice, quiet (altho the floor was quite creaky, but the Lodge IS in an old house) and surprisingly roomy for a London hotel. I was braced for a shoebox, but was pleasantly surprised. The room and bath were spotless, and the towels were changed daily. Lots of amenities in the room -- LCD TV, clock radio, blow dryer, iron AND pants press, plus tea-making stuff. There was free Internet in the lounge. I skipped the breakfast (it was included only one of my four days there, for some odd reason), instead partaking of the killer chocolate croissants from the grocery down the road. The hotel is in a great location. Shops and the East Putney Tube station are up the road; walk just a little farther, and you hit the High Street, with even more shops and restaurants. The No. 37 bus stops right out front ... a direct shot to Brixton, one way, or the High Street the other (get an Oyster card. Excellent!). There's also a minicab stand up the road .... 24GBP to Heathrow. Can't beat it. Unfortunately, my travelling companion didn't have the same experience. Got the dreaded Room 16 (see review below), a tiny double right under some very creaky stairs. She got moved to a single on the top floor, and said it was much better, and definitely quiet. The Wi-Fi turned out to not be free, and there was some mixup with the late night/early morning staff when her husband called and he was told she wasn't there. Eeek! Then there was the morning the fire alarm went off at 6.30. False alarm, thankfully. Some fool had lit up in a non-smoking room. My room was non-smoking -- and it was clearly marked that way -- yet there was an ashtray in the room. Something they need to work on. Overall, tho, the hotel was nice and the staff were friendly. I'd definitely stay there again if the price were right. Traveling companion said the same thing, just not in Room 16."
36,564,"Nov 18 2007 	Awesome hotel amazing staff	We had an awesome time in London and this hotel was a great find. We landed in London Heathrow early in the morning and took a cab to the hotel. We didn't expect to get to our room until miday but the staff were so helpful that they got a room ready for us and upgraded us. Great bed and very homely feel to it. Tiny tv. The staff were just amazing which made us feel so relaxed. The room was at the back of hotel down by the garden, it was really quiet almost as if you werent in the city. We went to see phantom of the opera, amazing! The tube is so easy to get around the city and the staff at reception helped explain everything to us...great people. After our stay we took a cab to the waterloo station for the eurostar to paris, how cool to be able to get the paris in 3 hours...Would definately recommend this hotel."
37,564,"Oct 21 2007	A truly frustrating experience	This hotel used to be awful, but I tried it again knowing it was under new management. Sadly, despite the posh brochure promising designer fittings and rooms perfect for business travellers, it's still pretty bad. The first night, the hot tap in my mother's room came away spraying scalding hot water everywhere. The second night my mother was downgraded to a single room because the hotel was filling up and they wanted to maximise takings by not having any single people sleeping in double beds. I was told twice by the reception manager that it was hotel policy to downgrade single occupants in this way. Can you imagine any traveller, especially the business traveller that this hotel aims at putting up with that? Incredible!"
38,564,"Oct 17 2007 	A little gem	My wife and I have stayed here on a number of occasions due to the fact that she works in the area from time to time. We last stayed in mid October.The hotel is clean and comfortable and offers parking.The buffet breakfast in the morning is good value and offers the full range of breakfast foods, hot and cold.The rooms are well appointed and the management are constantly upgrading the facilities. The hotel may not be as 'flash' as some others, but it has its own charm and individual appeal.However, the outstanding feature of this hotel is the level of service. The staff are excellent, and on every occasion on which we have stayed we have always found all members of staff to be courteous, helpful, efficient and happy. That last comment may sound a little strange, but it seems to us that where you have contented staff, you also have a very good establishment."
39,564,"Oct 10 2007 	Romantic catch up!	What a fantastic weekend we had. The purpose was for my girlfriend and I to have a bit of peace and quiet away from flat mates, having not seen each other for a couple of weeks. We booked their luxury room, and was not disappointed! The room was fantastic - massive comfy bed, flat screen TV, wine fridge, huge shower heads - clean, comfortable and luxurious! The staff were extremely helpful and courteous!The breakfast was well worth having - free if you have a luxury room! Fresh croissants, bread, fruit and various bits and bobs! The cooked breakfast was also of a very good standard!Both my girlfriend and I had a lovely weekend! We will defo come back again!!"
40,564,"Oct 8 2007 	Not exactly room 1408 but a real downgrade	My wife and I stayed two nights in Best Western The Lodge, Putney, in October because of their location, price, and the availability of free parking. We prepaid the full room cost several weeks in advance through the Best Western website, and we are Best Western Gold Crown Club members, but they did not look at our GCC number until we asked on check-out that it be entered in their records. Based on Trip Advisor comments, we requested an upper floor room because of footfall noise, and they had designated us for no-smoking room 59, a nice room with a pleasant view on the second floor. But whether or not you prepay or anything else, there is no guarantee that requests will be met, and on the day we arrived at 4 p.m., we were reassigned to non-smoking room 16 in the basement under a room and a set of stairs leading up to it, and every child's and adult's clump-clump above us resonated quite clearly in our hollow space. The room window looked out on a well and another room's window (see photo) and often on a workman who was making something with plywood boards during working hours. The writing pad by the phone consisted of just one sheet of paper. In the bathroom, the toilet tissue bar lacked a screw and slanted downward so the roll frequently fell off onto the floor. People in the walkway outside could see into our bathroom through the vanes of a plastic fan in the frosted glass of the window, so we showered in the dark. As we fell asleep late at night, we heard what sounded like the popping of fireworks or distant gunfire, but we determined later that it was the sound of a fusillade of floorboards squeaking as people passed the hallway near us. On the first morning of our stay, the breakfast area had too many guests, so we had to wait in the bar to be called to eat breakfast. The breakfast included warm and cold offerings, and I would rate it very good in very pleasant surroundings (see photo). The wait staff were overloaded on that morning, and our order for white toast was filled (with brown toast) as we were ready to leave. The butter, yoghurt, jam, and fruit were in a sliding-door refrigerator whose access was blocked by the knees and legs of anyone pouring milk into cereal bowls which took longer as the milk level ran down to a trickle. The breakfast menu stated that the cost for breakfast was Stg. 8 per person, so we quickly got out our Internet reservation confirmation and found that it did not refer to breakfast at all. We re-checked with the reception desk man who had simply told me when I checked in what time breakfast was served, and he assured us that, yes, breakfast was included in the cost of our room. When we checked out, a different receptionist told us that we would have to pay for breakfast for the two days of our stay. We still don't know which receptionist was correct but in the end we were not charged. There is one computer in a front room for guests to use for Internet access, and every room is a T-mobile hotspot where access costs about 50 cents a minute. The reception staff were polite in the manner of busy civil servants, which contrasted greatly with the friendly staff at Express by Holiday Inn, Hammersmith, who seemed selflessly caring for the comfort of their guests. Our small unprivate/ inconvenient room was as adequate as most apartments I had as a college student, parking was easy, and the breakfast was very good. But our missed luck in the room lottery and the functionarys politeness and confusion of the staff made us feel that the overall experience did not provide good value. For every loser there is a winner someplace, and I suspect that other members who ranked it a &quot;5&quot; did not have their awesome experiences in room no. 16, deep in the bowels of Best Western's The Lodge."
41,564,"Sep 24 2007 	Excellent	My family and I had a very pleasant stay at the Best Western Lodge Hotel. We stayed in a garden room that was quiet, clean and pleasantly decorated. The bar snacks were enjoyed by us all and the children would recommend the burger. Breakfast was a treat with buffet style that meant you could go back for more. The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and being so close to the tube meant we could leave our car in the car park - which is free! The rooms are an excellent price; we paid just 160 for our family room, which is excellent value for London. This hotel is the perfect place to stay when visiting London, as its so close to the centre yet away from the hustle. I would definitely recommend a stay here and we will most certainly go back."
42,564,"Jul 9 2007 	Good ratio price/quality	This hotel has good value for your money. This is not common in London, where the prices are very high. Also a good location, 250 m from metrostation East Putney (zone 2). Rooms are clean and pleasant.Nice breakfastarea with view on the garden. Helpful staff"
43,564,"Nov 23 2006 	You get what you pay for	This hotel is reasonable, and is located in a good location as previous postings mentioned. There is free parking behind the hotel and the breakfast is decent enough with nice rolls and croissants. However, if it has been recently updated, it's a fairly poor upgrade.The showers are below the standard expected from a BW hotel in a major city, alternating between scalding and freezing water. Other comments about creaky floorboards, breakfast smells and very soft beds are all still true.I booked an Executive Room online, but on checking in the booking read Economy Room. Reception advised me it's the same thing, but clearly it's not. Still, for two nights in (fairly central) London at 69 pounds a night (breakfast not included) it's not too bad - you get what you pay for basically.Would I stay here again, probably, but I'd expect a better room,,,"
44,564,"Sep 13 2004 	No sleep in Putney	My wife and I experienced a very uncomfortable night at this Best Western hotel. Forced out of our flat by flooding we relocated to this our local hotel. Althought the staff were pleasant and helpful at all times the standard of the accomodation was distinctly third rate. Though clean, the room was badly in need of redecorating. The bed was VERY uncomfortable. There was no air conditioning causing the room to be a sauna. The noise from the passing traffic was deafening with the room shaking everytime a lorry passed. Don't take a room on the front of the hotel if you want any sleep. Finally this hotel is outragously overpriced. I recommend going to the Putney Bridge Travel Inn instead. We did for our second night! It's half the price and twice as good!"
45,564,"Sep 7 2004	Not suitable for US travelers who expect US-based Best Western Standards	I had a 10 day business trip in Putney, London, and I booked the Best Western Lodge specifically for the Best Western name, thinking that because Best Western is a US based company, their hotels would more likely cater to the needs of (business) travelers from the US.The Lodge Hotel is badly in need of a major update. The hotel was also not air conditioned for summer.I started my first night in Room 4, which reminded of a room that you see in movies where fugitives would hide out in (think Thelma and Louise, or more recently, the movie Monster). Rooms 4 and 3 share a wall (which I believe was built specifically to separate 1 legitimate room into 2 rooms), and you can hear every word and other sounds coming from the next room. The doors of both room slams loudly, and as an added bonus, the floor above the room creeks terribly. I would not recommend Rooms 3 or 4 (these rooms are the Superior rooms).I asked for a room change, but the very polite front desk staff member told me that they were sold out that first night (the Saturday before their August Bank Holiday), but will switch my room the next night (Sunday). They were able to upgrade me to an Executive Room (Room 66). Room 66 had a more private entrance, but the windows opened to the restaurants dumpster (thankfully they did not smell badly during my stay) and to the restaurants exhaust fan. Because the hotel does not have air conditioning, the windows had to be kept open. During mornings, starting about 6:30am or so, you will feel like breakfast was being cooked in your room (you smell bacon and eggs, for sure, and the clashing of dishes). Not an entirely unpleasant way to wake up, if you are a breakfast person. I stayed in Room 66 for the remainder 8 nights.The floors of the hotel are in bad shape, as you can hear walking (loud and annoying creaking of the floor boards) from the rooms above. I had the misfortune of having a heavy-walker staying in the room above me, and I was awaken every time he or she stomped his or her way to the bathroom every night and every morning.Overall, the furniture is old, mattresses (in both rooms) are about 5 years older than they should be (those with bad backs, bring pain killers!), and towels are threadbare. I have been told by others who have stayed at The Lodge to ask for the Putney Suite on the next stay, which supposedly is much nicer (unfortunately I only got this information upon my return to the US). The staff though, by and large, is very pleasant. They have no control over the condition of the property, so I cannot fault them. The property is close to an Underground station (East Putney), so it is convenient to get out to Central London for sightseeing. For the prices they charge, I think you may want to spend a few more Pounds and stay in a nicer hotel in Central London, Richmond, or Wimbledon. Finally, for business travelers -- dont even think about working in your room! The desk space is nearly non-existent, and the lighting is terrible (at least in the Executive Room 66)."
46,564,Mar 24 2004	Beautiful hotel - very pleasant staff	The Lodge Hotel in Putney is so close to everyuthing and yet in the middle of a nice and relaxing residential area of Putney SW London. We stayed here several times and have to say that the hotel always exceeds our expectations and the staff is the nicest at all times. The executive rooms are worth the extra money and ask for a quiet room by their garden as it can get a little noisy at the front. Very close to the tube and we were very happy stying here.

1,574,"Nov 7 2009 	Terrible experience at Delmere Hotel	I will never stay at the Delmere Hotel again!!I was treated in the most disrespectful way when there was confusion about my booking which was off by one day. The Manager insisted on charging me for the mistaken day despite my having booked three nights stay. Most would have accomodated the mistake (regardless of whose fault) given the the multiple night booking, but not at the Delmere. They insisted on charging me and were so rude I left and booked into the Hilton Paddington. I WILL NEVER BE BACK! Too many better hotels in the area!!"
2,574,"Nov 6 2009 	Great location very nice hotel	We stayed in this hotel for three nights. The location is great, very close to Paddington station which made it easy to go back to drop things / pick things up during the day. There are also a lot of restaurants in the neighbourhood, so you have a lot of choice. The room was very nice and clean. The breakfast was good, a nice buffet with the option of ordering full english breakfast. The full english was made to order and very nice. We will stay here again next time!"
3,574,"Oct 22 2009 	No heat in late September - early October	No heat of any kind in the hotel (and no air conditioning other than very small portable room fan). Sept. had a cold spell plus maid left the windows open all day, so when I returned late evening, felt like I was sleeping outside - this happened several times. Put on four layers of shirts and had two blankets, but still cold. This went on for most of my 19 day stay during Sept.-Oct. 2009. Brick-concrete 100 yr old Victorian bldg has no insulation. I have stayed here several times in the past and found it extremely convenient to Heathrow Express about a ten minute walk, trains to Oxford and north of London, two tube stations nearby, 30 minute walk to concerts at Royal Albert Hall, 20 minute walk to Kensington Palace, grocery stores in Paddington Train Station for snacks ten minute walk, so no spend money on taxis. Always clean room, but very small. Only five hangers for my long stay with good clothes, but staff could not locate even one extra hanger for me when I asked more than once. Hair dryer was taped to work. Hassle to use the room safe. New flat screen TV was nice. Only one hotel computer and was out of order at least three times when I really depended on it, so I missed a very important meeting. Continental breakfast OK, but it never changes if you stay several days. Breakfast room always clean. Remodeled some curtains in hotel. Quiet back rooms, but front rooms have some traffic noise 7am- 10pm. Current staff friendly and professionally trained. Problem in general is London hotels are notoriously small and too expensive with unpredictable quality and just cannot give the value compared with ANY hotel in the United States. I do not think any American would be statisfied with any London hotel. I have stayed in about a dozen London hotels. I hope this one would have been adequate given its good location to the trian station, but now I am not sure. Lift but several rooms are inaccessible via lift."
4,574,"Oct 1 2009 	Great location; but tiny stuffy rooms	PLUS - This hotel is in a really great location - 2 min walk from Paddington Station and lots of bars, restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Only 10 min walk to Hyde Park too. Continental breakfast is good and the staff were friendly. Free internet also.NEGATIVES - our room was on the third floor and it was soooooooo hot and stuffy that it actually ruined our stay! The temperature was 20 degrees and we were dying at night, so I dread to think how warm the rooms on this floor would get in the summer months."
5,574,"Sep 17 2009 	Great location wonderful staff	We stayed in room 307 for 5 nights. The room was very small, typical of London, but very clean. Very clean small bathroom. Shower only. Our room overlooked the alley, so it was quiet. Nice soap and shampoo in the bathroom. Remember to pack a face cloth, they aren't supplied. The young staff that work in the hotel are excellent both at the front desk and at breakfast. The continental breakfast was complimentary with our room. Perfect for us, bread, rolls, croissant, cheese, ham, cereal, juices, yogurt, coffee &amp; tea. We ate there every morning. The location is great, an easy walk from Paddington Station, and all it has to offer. Lots of restaurants nearby. Easy walk to Hyde Park, Kenningston Gardens &amp; Palace. The little bar in the hotel is a nice touch as was the free internet in the basement level den."
6,574,"Sep 4 2009 	Great Location Value for money.	I stayed her at beginning of September for a week. The hotel is one of many of converted apartment houses. Thus the rooms are a bit cramped but very well done. I stayed in room 302 and had a double bed with small night tables on either side. There was a desk with chair and another chair in the room. A narrow closet held additional linen and pillows along with accommodating my clothes. There was also a narrow shelf on the wall holding a kettle with teapot and two cups and saucers. There was tea of course, instant coffee (regular and decaf) with sugar and sweet &amp; low. I liked the choice of cream or milk too. The bathroom was small but a very good use of space, no tub but very good shower enclosure. The towels were good as were the liquid soaps at the sink and in the shower. There is a flat screen TV on the wall facing the bed with a nice selection of channels and a clock attached below. The room is well lit and the bed very comfortable. No air-con but there was a fan, which I didn't need. The window opened onto the street so you have the noise of the road below but with the window closed it was bearable. The heavy curtains kept out the early morning sun too. The free wireless internet was great, the login code changes everyday at noon but that was not problem, just asked the friendly front desk staff for it. They were very helpful at check-in with no problems experienced and they held my bag while I explored the city until the 2pm check-in time. My bags had already been taken to my room when I returned at 3pm. Very welcomed. There is a small elevator, a small terrace outside the small bar/lounge and a small dining room in basement where you can get breakfast. Unfortunately I never ate there so cannot rate the food or service. There are many dining options along the roads within walking distance as well as at Paddington Rail Station, which is only a 5 minute walk away. Great if you are coming in on the Heathrow Express train. In all a very good experience."
7,574,"Aug 21 2009 	Good value	I stayed in a twin room for one night. The room was very small, with the beds about a foot apart; however, they were able to fit a desk and extra chair in the room, which was nice. Not a room you would want to hang out in but perfectly fine as a base for exploring London. Paddington Station is a five minute walk from the hotel. The room was not air-conditioned, but they provided a fan, which helped. Though the room itself was clean, I have to take off a star for the absolutely filthy curtain in the bathroom. Since the window is right above the sink, it was impossible to avoid noticing the grime and stains on this curtain, and every time the breeze blew it toward me, I would jump out of the way because I didn't want it to touch me, it was that nasty. Otherwise, this hotel was a good value."
8,574,"Jul 22 2009 	Good	Hotel was acceptable for a few nights, the room was very small but adequate especially for a business traveller. The staff where very nice and could not do enough for me. The free internet was great as well.I did have to ask for more tea and milk but that was not a problem. I would suggest a good book as there are only five tv channels, freeview wouldn't go amiss.Breakfast was nice but the dining room got awfully full after 8 amRates and location are good, it is what it is, if you want more then pay more"
9,574,"Jul 18 2009 	Not impressed! Staff abrupt not too friendly service non existant!!	After booking a room at the Admiral Hotel which is opposite the Delmere we were moved to the Delemere as they has a water damage in our room, the gentleman at the Admiral was very politeand sibcere my than i can say about the staff at the Delemere. The room 205 was in need of a refurb!! The wardrobe was filthy inside, the bed was not made on;y half done, the cups and saucers had stains inside, gteaspoons still had coffee on it!! At breakfast we waited to be seated only to be met by a grumpy waitress who lacked in communication skills, she brought our coffee and never saw her again, We were expecting a hot buffet breakfast, unfortunatelt there is no english breakfast, felt likethat none of the staff seemed to really look after their guest, this is my first and last time at a Best Western Hotel!!"
10,574,"Jul 17 2009 	Good value -- great location	We were only going to be in London 2 nights and had an early departure out of Heathrow so we wanted to be near Paddington Station to get the express train. This hotel is very convenient to Paddington Station and Metro stop. Our room was very small but included tv, fan, hairdryer, coffee/tea service. Bathroom, though small, was very clean with good storage shelves. Our room was on the back side and was very quiet even though we slept with the window open. Free internet was great. Breakfast was not included in our rate. There is a nice lounge/sitting area if you feel you need more space for reading/relaxing. We found a nice modern Italian restaurant a few blocks away."
11,574,"Jun 7 2009 	This is an excellent clean well decorated hotel.	Though the room was small, it was very clean and beautifully decorated. It has obviously been renovated recently. The wall paper, rug, bed covering were tasteful and clean. The room was small and it was amazing to see how many amenities could be added to such a small room, including TV, fan, desk, closet, night stands. The bathroom, also small, had counter tops with nice touches like Kleenex, hand towels, and hand soap. It was a vast improvement over the hotel we stayed in the previous week in London. It is also very close to Paddington Station and two subway stations and restaurants."
12,574,"May 19 2009 	Great Cheap Paddington Hotel	I was looking for a clean, cheap hotel close to Paddington Station and thats exactly what I got. Rooms are quite basic, clean and on the small side but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay. Free internet was a nice bonus.There are lots of restaurants on the door step and Paddington train station is less than 5 minutes walk away."
13,574,Apr 23 2009 	Mind your head!!!	I had previously stayed at the Best Western Paddington Court so was looking for something more when I found I had to travel to the London at short notice.The Delmere was a disappointment in that the rooms were tiny. My suitcase took up a lot of space in the room.I really wonder how they managed to squeeze in the attached bathroom.!!!The buffet breakfast was passable but I made up my mind there and then never to return to the Delmere again even if it meant that my stay cost a little more.
14,574,"Jan 4 2009 	Just loved it...	We had poured over review after review for hotels in London and were getting a bit discouraged. Our budget seemed to limit us to hotels with medium-low reviews. But apon arrival we were pleasently surprised! We arrived to meet friendly staff who helped coordinate our lost baggage and its safe arrival from the airport into our room. They had offered recomendations for areas to walk, pubs to visit... Our room was small, granted - but, that's Europe. If you're looking for a resort type holiday, this is not the place to stay. Don't go in expecting the 'American' style Best Western experience. Most of these hotels don't have pools, work out rooms, large suite like rooms or large public areas. But, if you're like us and just want a clean, safe, comfortable place to rest at the end of a long day of exploring. This is the place for you. Most important to note, even though there is a lift, you may still have some stairs to get to your room. The food was good, (My fiance still raves about the coffee...), the area was really nice, great access to transportation, and as I said the hotel was clean, friendly and safe. It's a place I'd definitely go back to."
15,574,"Nov 16 2008	Clean and Great Location	After staying at the Gresham for three nights--prebooked--I walked down the street to the Best Western for three more nights. I was not staying at the Gresham any longer, and I agree with the bad comments in a previous post. Though the front door folks were friendly and nice to us. For the same price and breakfast, the Best Western was a wondeful change, as it was CLEAN and looked as if it had been recently redone. I agree small, but it was CLEAN. There was also a very comfortable sitting room in the basement. Don't use their computer, as it overpriced, much cheaper alternatives in the neighborhood. The Paddington area is not that great, but the location is great. It's within walking distance to Marble Arch and all that surrounds it. I used the Tube to go everywhere. Evans Tours picked me up for a couple of long all day tours in front of Paddington Hilton and dropped me off at Gloucester Road tube, so only a couple of stops from Paddington. We had a hard time with restauants in the Paddington area. We liked a wine bar and I think an Italian restaurant called Jax (I think it's chain), which was pretty good, two blocks down on a side street off Sussex Gardens. Also a Cafe Nero on that street. The pubs were not so good, or at least we didn't find the right one."
16,574,"Jul 9 2008 	Uuugggghhhh!	We booked late, a sure sign of trouble. We wanted to share a room to save a little $ and took a room with 2 single beds that were pushed together. Even with the beds together, the room was extremely small and my friend and I were stepping all over one another. The blanket and bedspread had what looked like semen stains, the beds were extremely hard. One night I listened to a couple arguing for 5 minuets, another, I was awoken by a guest or staff member throwing up in the back garden area. The hallways, elevator, bathrooms are all so tiny. The room had no iron, the shower area a bit moldy and paper-thin walls. Dinner was okay but skip breakfast here. The only plus was a good meal in the restaurant (over priced but okay), the room had a hair dryer, and it was three blocks from Paddington Station. This is a nice neighborhood, but if you wait until the last minute to book the Hilton, skip this place. You would be better off in a hostel!"
17,574,"Oct 23 2007	clean basement room yours for $200 a night	Down the stairs, outside into the airshaft, and the door to my room (and four others) was right there: how convenient. Small room, with two tiny twin beds (I'm 1m87, tiny is not fun); very clean, with modern bathroom. Decent English breakfast, served by pleasant staff. Don't buy Internet access; if your computer will not interface with their system, they will NOT refund your money. Of course, you find this out only after you have paid. They stole 3.5 (1 hour access) from me, but the overnight rate is over 10 pounds, so it could have been worse. For $200, an absolute ripoff, even in London. I've stayed in several hotels near Paddington in recent years; the Delmere is, by far, the worst of the lot."
18,574,"Aug 3 2007 	Clean safe and excellent value	All you could possibly need for an overnight stay in London. Rooms are small but immaculate, there is a really comfortable loung with hsia and breakfast was a much less stressful experience than in larger hotels which often involves a long wait.Walking distance from Paddington and a few nice pubs and restaurants around. It had the feeling of a family run hotel and I felt very secure too."
19,574,"Feb 24 2007	Pretty good place.	Pretty decent location. Smallish but clean room, and an adequate breakfast."
20,574,"Feb 21 2007	Overpriced	The hotel is located on a street that has about 15 other identical hotels on it. Rooms, hallways, breakfast area, reception, stairs are all quite small.Room was clean and quiet.Breakfast choice is limited and I would avoid paying for it if it's not included in your room rate.It's about 5-7 minute walk to the Lancaster gate tube station which is often crowded since this area of London has literally hundreds of &quot;budget&quot; hotels which still charge extortionate prices. Your money can go a lot further than this place and if you shop around you can find hotels that are not only more central but better in size and quality for the same price."
21,574,Feb 7 2007 	Great Little Hotel	Was supposed to stay down the road at the Gresham hotel but their rooms weren't suitable (see my review for that hotel!) so 30 seconds down the road and we found this hotel- what a relief! They only had smoking rooms left but the only way we knew it was smoking was the ashtray and matches! The room did not smell of smoke and nor did we end up smelling of it either. The room was small but adequate for our needs for one night and in a good location. The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained and everything worked! The noise from the road wasn't an issue for us and the bed was reasonably comfortable. Breakfast was nice and simple and all the staff on reception were friendly. Would definately stay here again.
22,574,"Oct 4 2006 	Truly awful hotel!!!	Do not stay here if you value a good night's sleep!! The noise from the road outside was loud and continuous but didn't quite succeed in drowning out the noise coming from the rooms above and beside us. I don't think we slept a wink that night! We knew that it was a twin room but what we weren't expecting was two single beds, head to head with a large headboard between us. The room was only marginally bigger than a shoe box and got very stuffy at night, and the bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen.The breakfast was not the best we've ever had (!) and I agree with previous reviews that the restaurant area itself leaves a lot to be desired.All in all, I'd say avoid this hotel - there are plenty of other ones along the same road that looked a lot nicer (certainly their reception areas looked a lot more welcoming than this one)."
23,574,"Oct 2 2006 	Terrible hotel!!	A truly awful London hotel. Convenient for Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express, but otherwise has absolutely nothing going for it. With plenty of other 3-star hotels in the neighbourhood to choose from, I recommend you go elsewhere. The room was incredibly small, cramped and stuffy, as were all of the public spaces within the hotel. The bathroom was revolting with mould in the shower and used soap on the basin (!). The towels were as stiff as boards and the size of postage stamps. The bedlinen was crumpled and tatty although thankfully (apparently) clean. The noise from outside was overwhelming, but drowned out the noise from upstairs until first thing in the morning. I had an early train and although reception had agreed to provide breakfast 15 minutes before &quot;official&quot; breakfast times, the kitchen had not been informed and this was not available. The reception staff were surly and rude and far more interested in chatting among themselves than serving guests. All in all, not a pleasant stay. Avoid."
24,574,"Sep 11 2006 	Great Location	Great location for attending a function in Hyde Park, handy for Paddington. Unfortunatley our request for a non smoking room was unable to be met, hence a musty room with cigarette burns in the blanket. Our room on the 4th floor was compact but as we were only using it for a base &amp; to sleep for the weekend it was fine. As the room was an attic room it was extremely hot, resulting in our need to keep the window open all night &amp; as the hotel is situated on a busy road with a large hospital around the corner not much sleep was gained that night. Having said that when we asked for a fan from reception the following morning one was supplied for a small deposit. The ensuite was clean &amp; the water pressure in the shower was great. The bar was tiny and not used, the restaurant only sat 24 people &amp; when busy the 3 staff struggled to provide a good service for breakfast, despite being self service. I must say that the receptionist was extremely helpful &amp; friendly but this would not be our 1st choice for a return stay."
25,574,"Sep 10 2006 	fair price for London hotel.	We paid a 100 for our double room and continental breakfast, which we considered reasonable, as our hotel was 10 minutes walk from our venue, Hyde Park. I had telephoned the hotel a few weeks before and asked if it was possible to have a room with a bath and the dear Receptionist remembered and we had a room with a bath. Wot bliss. Visitors from abroad were afforded much assistance by Staff.. All the fine houses in the area are now Hotels and as such were not purpose built, so rooms are going to be small. The breakfast room/restaurant is lower ground floor and not particularly impressive. Given the thousands of eating places in London,the Perla would only be suitable for tired travellers who did not wish to travel far for a meal. Maybe it was just one of those days, but we had to wait for a table for breakfast,had to remind the staff about our coffee and when the cooked breakfast arrived, were offered no condiments. Small issues, but attention to detail is everything. The hotel industry is not renowed for overpaying its staff and given we were staying in a nice part of London, considered it value for money. However, am not sure if we would stay more than 1 night as there are countless small hotels in the area , all eager for trade. Perhaps some consideration could be given to having a more inviting eating area on ground level and opening up small reception area."
26,574,"May 16 2006	Clean and comfortable	Our room was downstairs and was small but not too small. Location was handy, five minutes walk from paddington and Hyde park on a quiet street. For continential breakfast, it was good, and we were able to get our fill for the morning (self serve). Most importantly the place was very clean, something you can't take for granted. Would stay again."
27,574,"Apr 19 2006	Dissappointing	Took a 'Get Away' Best Western break at this hotel for two nights on the 24th March. Room was in a courtyard at the rear of the hotel. Had to mend the plug on the basin and clear the blocked shower tray drain to empty the water. Otherwise the room was adaquate.The Get away menu for those staying was totally inadaquate with main meals only consisting of something and chips. My main couse was totally inedable. The prawn cocktail comprised of three deep fried prawns with a salad garnish. The manageress said she thought that was what a prawn cocktail should consist of !! We made a complaint, left the resturant and never ate there again. My formal complant to Best western remains unanswered. Would not recommend this hotel. We have previously been very pleased with other Best Western Hotels. This one lets the side down and so does thier customer services."
28,574,"Mar 29 2006 	Did not enjoy my stay	Stayed here for four days, on business. In a single room on the fourth floor. No pressure for the shower entailed turning the tap in the sink on in order to build up water pressure. I had problems with broadband, but I think this was my work servers rather than hotel broadband.I preferred to stay out in the evenings rather than spend time in the cramped accommodation.Plastic croissants in the morning unforgiveable, especially since all the staff were French.Staff helpful enough, but did not appear to be knowledgeable about a) shower, b) broadband.I stayed here because it was cheap. Next time, I am going to pay the extra and stay somewhere roomy and comfortable."
29,574,"Mar 5 2006	Cramped but satisfactory	I stayed one night to attend a function in town. Hotel was easy to find from Paddington tube.The single room was very small (tea making equipment above the bed headboard!), but with a place for everything I need. Everything was clean and functional. Some road noise, but this is London of course. I got the impression that sound insulation between rooms wasn't great but since I didn't have noisy neighbours it wasn't a problem.Breakfast was fine, service efficient overall.Good value at 59 B&amp;B in central London"
30,574,"Feb 25 2006	Good for London hotel.	My wife and I stayed in the same room as the previous poster. Depending on your point of view the room was pokey or cosy, we found it to be pokey on initial inspection but cosy once we'd gotten used to it. It is indeed very quiet which was a real blessing considering it's London location. The bathroom is tiny but clean and adaquate. The shower is one of the best I've ever used in a hotel with a nice powerful water flow. The supplied toilettries were of a good quality and they were not mean with the supply.The room itself was quite small, but had well designed fixtures for the tea making facilities and bedside storage. The bed was my only gripe with this hotel, not only was it too small for two people it was not the most comfortable. It may be that I am spoiled with the quality of beds in American hotels but for the rate I believe you should get better.The main hotel was well appointed, and the continental breakfast had what you need to start the day. The lounge allowed smoking so smelled as such.The staff were friendly although I would not rely on them for directions. The hotel is very convienient for transport links (paddington is 5 minutes walk away) and there are a number of pubs, restaurants, fast food joints and newsagents nearby.I would recommend this hotel but avoid paying the rack rate, it's not worth 115 pounds a night for the room we stayed in."
31,574,"Jan 23 2006	Great Location Superb Staff	We stayed here for 3 nights in a room which was away from the main part of the hotel, across a small courtyard. Thankfully, we managed to get the room for a very good deal, thanks to a National Rail promotion. For location, it's superb. You are two blocks from Paddington station, which is very well served for tube lines and mainline rail from Heathrow (and a great terminus if you want to go to Bath or maybe Wales for sightseeing!)The local area is good, well served with takeaway food outlets and pubs. We never felt unsafe or threatened.The room we stayed in (No.15) was more cosy than pokey. I would recommend it for a couple carrying a small amount of luggage. The room was cleaned daily and the continental breakfast good and plentiful. For London, we found it amazingly quiet. Maybe this was luck, but we never heard traffic, cop sirens or even next-door neighbours. Bliss!Staff were brilliant. One night I needed a beer bottle opener. Not only did the receptionist gladly provide me with one, but she even loaned me two glasses from the bar to take back to the room. What a refreshing change.Highly recommended - if you can get a deal."
32,574,"Jan 6 2006 	Poky but handy	I stayed in the Best Western for two nights while attending a course in London. The first night I arrived late (around ten p.m.) and I must have got the last room available. It was out a back door, into a courtyard and was stuck in a little corner separate from the hotel. The room itself was literally a coffin with just enough room for a bed and was very claustrophobic. The window was tiny and couldn't be opened fully as it was on the ground floor. The television also did not work and I had a horrible night's sleep with the noise from party revellers in the bar next door. I even heard someone get sick out a window during the night.The following night I requested they move me to a more pleasant room and they put me in one on the third floor. What a difference. While the room was still small, which is to be expected in London I suppose, it was much more spacious than the previous one. Everything worked, the bed was more than comfortable, and I slept soundly. All of a sudden I loved the quirkiness of the hotel again.The included buffet breakfast is more than adequate. The full English (which I got on the second day) is nice, but a bit on the expensive side.The location was the best seller for me - 5 minutes walk to Hyde Park or the train station. Plenty of pubs around the corner for good food and good restaurants if you want something a bit more upmarket.Overall, I think it is luck of the draw whether or not you get a good room. Staff were courteous, but not as friendly as some other reviewers made out (in my experience anyway). Would I stay there again? - probably not (unless I had assurances that I would be getting a really good room), but I would pick another hotel in the same location. Unfortunately, I forgot my camera so could not take any photos."
33,574,"Nov 25 2005 	Good value friendly staff walls like paper....	Can recommand this place, been there for 3 nights. Knowing the size of a London hotelroom I always book a double room, the extra space is definitely worth the money. So the room was OK, clean and quiet.In the first night loud guests next door, the walls are thin... But that is the only point to critisize. Excellent value for the price (I paid 60 GBP incl. brakfast) Breakfast was not very spectacular, but OK and included in the room price. The place has a fast WLAN net from the hotel, costs 12 GBP per day, good performance and speed. I travel to London very often and have seen lots of worse places for much, much more money."
34,574,"Oct 25 2005	Clean and Comfortable	We stayed in the Delmere in early October 2005 for 3 nights and found it to be very clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location couldn't have been better. Simply catch the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and walk 2 blocks. Clear instructions are provided on the hotel's website. The Continental breakfast, included in the price, was more than adequate with stewed fruit, yoghurt, cheese, ham, croissants, toast, jam, juices, tea &amp; coffee. However the cooked breakfast at a cost of 9 pounds was disappointing and is not recommended. Stick to the continental breaky! If you're expecting a large room and bathroom, you will be disappointed. We have travelled extensively in Europe so knew what to expect. The room was very comfortable, providing everything you needed including a TV, hair-dryer and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was tiny - only space for one person at a time, but again, had everything you needed. There is no soundproofing to the rooms, so noisy neighbours who let their door slam could annoy light sleepers. This is a problem in most budget priced hotels. The location of the hotel was quiet, so outside street noise was not a problem.There are numberous restaurants and bars nearby. Public transport and the hop-on, hop-off tourist bus stops are just around the corner."
35,574,"Oct 22 2005	I slept in a cupboard!	Teeny weeny room that just fitted the bed....a shower which was up 4 large steps...after confessing my mistake to colleagues , they also admitted to having stayed here and hating it!Do not be fooled by the best Western branding and brilliant price compared to others...it is truely awful!I did not sleep...bedroom boiling despite wndow wide openBreakfast more than depressing!i left an hour and a half before my train as i prefered to sit at the station.Horrible, horrible, horribleDO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!"
36,574,"Oct 14 2005 	Comfortable and convenient	the Delmere isn't in the best area of town - but it's a great little place, good value, relatively quiet, and very convenient to the tube. I stayed there for almost 1 week while in London for work, and found it quite comfortable. I did much work in the lower level lounge, which suited my needs well."
37,574,"Sep 15 2005	Great place to stay	The Best Western Delmere is a great place to stay, especially for the price. It is very conveniently located just two blocks from Paddington station in a neighborhood full of restaurants, pubs, and more.The room was a bit small, but that was to be expected. Nor was it air conditioned (also expected) but the staff supplied a small fan, and with the windows open in early September, it was more than cool enough in the evenings. The bed was big enough for two and plenty comfortable.Our room was spotlessly clean when we arrived, and cleaned well every day we stayed - our stay lasted eight nights. The bathroom was also quite clean as well as newly fixtured. It was also very quiet, excepting one evening when we had some rather loud neighbors. It helps that this is a very small hotel - less than 40 rooms.The continental breakfast was plentiful (if heavy on bread products - rolls, croissants, cereals, toast, some fruits, yogurt and ham and cheese) and the waitstaff extremely friendly.All in all, our stay was extremely pleasant, and we would happily stay at the Delmere again."
38,574,"Jun 14 2005 	Good for the price but tight and a little cold.	I have to say first we spent three nights there and had a very pleasant stay. The breakfast (included) was more than sufficient. The rooms were clean and neat. The location was excellent and the staff....the staff were the best part, friendly, obliging and very cheerful, particularly the ladies at the reception desk.The downside, very small rooms. If you have a lot of luggage or children it will be inconvenient. There is a lift but as we discovered, it took us to the 2nd floor but then we had to haul the luggage down a flight of stairs to get to our room. The house is old and the stairs are all over the place. One of our rooms was in an outside section which was very quite but again we'd come along way (London was one of many stops), had a long way left to go and it was all a bit much for us as we each had a large suitcase and smaller bag. I have to admit to being frustrated at times with the lack of space. My father also had trouble finding his way about in the maze of door and stairs.The other thing was the heating. it was April, it was cold and the heating turned off automatically in the evening. My father complained of the cold and I went to the desk to ask them to turn on the heating and they said they couldn't. They offered my a little electric heater and charged my credit card 10 pounds for the use (it was to be deducted once the heater was returned, and it was, but I was a little flummoxed by the whole situation). I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for cheap, clean and convenient but before-warned of small room and cold nights. I rated it with the price in mind."
39,574,"Jun 1 2005	Small Room But Convenient Location	We arrived in London at Heathrow Airport. Then we took the Heathrow Express train that stops at the Paddington Station. The Delmere Hotel is only two blocks from the Paddington Station. The room was quite small but very clean. The weather was warm in London. We were glad to have a window in our room, because there wasn't air conditioning in the room. The continental breakfast was typical. The hotel staff was friendly and quite helpful. What made the Delmere Hotel wonderful was the location, near the Paddington train and tube station, near Hyde Park, restaurants, shops etc. It was easy to either walk or take the tube to various locations in London."
40,574,"May 15 2005	Good but small	The Delmere is conveniently located a few minutes walk from Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was spotlessly clean if a bit small. Continental breakfast came with the room and was nice, although choice was a bit limited. Overall, for the price of 70 per night for a double room, the hotel represented good value in London - I've seen far worse for much more and would happily stay there again."
41,574,"May 11 2005	Noisy and small	Unless you are looking for a cheap place to stay before catching an early flight, I would not recommend this hotel. I stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to Paddington station (I was catching a 6:30 am flight out of Heathrow). When I arrived, I was given a tiny smoking room, even though I had requested a non-smoking room. Further, I did not get even an hour of sleep as the windows are thin and I could hear all conversations and cars outside even though I was wearing ear plugs. The hotel has no air conditioning and the heat in the room was unbearable. When I asked for a fan, the desk clerk gave me a heating device and told me that it blew cold air....it didn't. After a call, she brought me a real fan. My advice: stay at the Comfort Inn at Hyde Park."
42,574,"Apr 25 2005	Loved the Delmere	Excellent hotel on Sussex Gardens, just two blocks from Paddington Station in downtown London. Very clean, up-to-date rooms, excellent baths, exceptionally helpful staff, and a great free breakfast. Not only that, it's less expensive than most of the rip-off places in London. A Best Western hotel. Great value -- would stay there again in a minute!"
43,574,"Apr 21 2005	Delmere a good choice	We booked the Delmere near Paddington after much research on Trip Advisor. We made a good choice. When we arrived early they held our luggage till we returned later in the day. Our room was very clean and the bathroom had corian counter tops, newer and very clean. Yes, the room and bathroom area were small but we expected this as most in London are. The price was agreeable at 75 pounds a night thru LONDONNIGHTSThe continental breakfast each morning was delightful and the staff in the breakfast room were great! We asked for two twin beds and our room had them pushed together for a Queen size bed. We had towels each day and upon inspection of the mattress I was satisfied we had found a clean place to stay. My only poor review would be for the blonde at the desk who seemed to be in charge during the day. Not rude but felt like she didn't like her job or the intrusion of guests who ask questions. Otherwise all personnel were great, including those in the lounge area. Paddington station was a short two blocks away, very easy to navigate if you are pulling luggage as we were. The HEATHROW EAXPRESS goes straight to Paddington in no time at all. Would recommend this hotel and location without reservation."
44,574,"Mar 30 2005	Loved the Delmere.	I just returned from a week at the Delmere and my husband and I were quite pleased. The staff was very gracious and helpful and the room rate included a continental breakfast. The rooms were small as are most European hotels, but very clean and all that we needed. It's in a GREAT location and I felt very safe the whole time. I would and hope to stay there again. :D"
45,574,"Mar 28 2005	Clean as a whistle	What a nice little hotel with surprising friendly Dutch staff. My husband and I picked the Delmere after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. By American standards, the room is small and so is the bathroom but this is how things are in London. I must say that the place was spotless. Continental breakfast which was included, includes rolls, yogurt, ham, cheese, cereals, juice and fruit, which was more than enough variety. The location is very close to Paddington Station which runs a direct line to Heathrow called the Heathrow Express. We would definately stay there again."
46,574,"Mar 19 2005	Great Location Noisy Housekeeping	We just returned from a one week stay in London. We booked our stay at the Delmere after reading many glowing reviews on this site. The staff were very nice and helpful overall, and the room was clean, comfortable, and more than adequate for our needs. My sole complaint about the Delmere is that every single morning, around 8 o'clock, we were woken up by the extremely loud noises of the housekeeping staff opening and slamming the 3 doors surrounding our room. This was particularly bad on the afternoon of our arrival, as we were exhausted after a 12 hour trek and desperately wanted to sleep. We had to wait until 3 o'clock when the crew finally finished before we could get a few hours of sleep before going out for dinner. It didn't help that our room was directly across from the housekeeping storage room, as they kept going in and out of that room, resulting in very loud door slamming. Other than the noise, the hotel was wonderful, clean, and safe."
47,574,"Mar 19 2005 	Single room only closet sized	I stayed at the Best Western Delmere Hotel March 7 &amp; 8 and my experience was not memorable, which sometimes is good. The stay was comfortable but I was really disappointed with the size of the single room on the top floor. The street on which the Delmere is located is two or three blocks from Paddington station, and only walkable if you are rolling your suitcases. Some nice restaurants are in the neighborhood, however. I arrived early and my room was not ready. Perhaps doubles are better, but mine was hardly large enough for the narrow and short firm bed, with little room to open my suitcase. The shower stall was up two steps (?!) and the toilet stall was quite cramped. Television channel selection was only the standard. I had just stayed at a B &amp; B north of London which had better TV and a larger room for one third of the price. Hot breakfast cost more, but the free cold breakfast at Delmere was just fine, with cereals, sliced cheese and ham, rolls or croissants, tea, coffee, etc. and there was a bar/restaurant on site for suppers. All in all, certainly not a disaster, and the staff was very cheerful and friendly. Just avoid it if you are claustrophobic."
48,574,"Mar 13 2005	Great budget hotel	I booked a single room from the Best Western website for 55/night, and because the rate was so low I was a bit nervous about what the hotel would be like but I was very pleased with it. Although the room was the smallest I've ever been in, it was clean and tastefully decorated and the hotel staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The location is good as it's close to both Paddington and Edgware Road stations, and as a single woman I felt safe walking to the hotel from the tube at night, as well as safe in the hotel in general. In other reviews of london hotels the poor quality of the showers was mentioned and I can say that the water pressure at the Delmere was fine. All in all, this hotel is very good value for the money and I would reccommend staying here if you're looking for an inexpensive hotel in central london that doesn't compromise on quality and convenience."
49,574,"Jan 7 2005	A Great Holiday	My wife and 3 adult children stayed at the Delmere for 7 nights, 12/23-12/26 and 12/31-1/3. In between we traveled to Rome. The proximity to Paddington station was convenient for access to the Heathrow Express. We were able to walk to the Delmere with our luggage. Also used the Paddington tube stop for access to all of London. The rooms were clean and comfortable, with a nice bathroom and shower. The complimentary continental breakfast was a great start to each day. After each full day of touring the city sights, it was nice to return to our quiet neighborhood. There were several pubs and restaurants in the area. There was a comfortable and well appointed lounge room which we used for family gatherings. We also took advantage of their small bar. The staff was friendly and accomodating. They had our 3 rooms available before check-in time, since we arrived early from an all night flight. They also held our luggage after check-out, as we had a late afternoon flight out. We would stay at the Delmere again."
50,574,"Dec 10 2004	Good Location Closet-Like Rooms	Stayed at the Delmere for 3 nights in December, 2004. Location is great - 2 minutes from Paddington station (and the express train to/from Heathrow) and the Tube, along Sussex Gardens. Plenty of places to eat/drink in the area. My single room was the smallest I have ever let in Europe (I've been to more than a dozen cities and stayed in several BW's) and this was definitely a closet. It had all the amenities - shower, separate WC, hair dryer, toiletries, and a coffee maker - so I can't complain too much. Breakfast is adequate - continental style - breads, cheeses, yogurt, good-sized packets of cereal, etc. You even have the option of a full English breakfast (although this is extra - the continental breakfast is included in the rate) There is also a restaurant/bar attached to the hotel.Staff was very friendly and helpful. Sussex Gardens is busy with traffic, I had a room facing the street, but the hotel is set back far enough from the road to where the noise didn't bother me and I had the window open my entire stay!This is one of many small hotels that adjoin each other along Sussex Gardens. When I first arrived I actually entered the hotel next to the Delmere where the room rate was 30% lower. I couldn't imagine the rooms being much different because these hotels are all in the same attached row-buildings. Next time I will try one of the neighboring hotels, although I can assure you that the BW Delmere is a fine place to stay. I just think you'll get the same thing next door at a much lower price."
51,574,"Dec 6 2004 	Clean 	I booked a single room for 02 Dec via laterooms.com and paid 70 (you would pay 91 phoning the hotel direct). The Delmere is one of numerous hotels along Sussex Gardens, which is quite a busy road. The room itself was absolutely fine, and better than I had expected. Small, yes, but spotlessly clean with a pristine shower &amp; toilet, and quality white towels. The room was cold when I arrived but I turned the radiator on full and within a very short time it was belting out heat. Safe, coffee making facilities, small TV working perfectly. If you a lone traveller you can use the lounge area downstairs, with comfortable armchairs. Breakfast was also good. I eat like a mouse but others had the choice of cereals, yoghurt, fruit etcThe only thing to remember is to ASK FOR A ROOM AT THE BACK when booking. I had asked for a non smoking room but it was the only one available, and was at the front. I couldn't bear the idea of smoke permeated fabrics so I suffered the street noise instead. I didn't sleep too badly but was woken at 0600 by a BT van in the street offloading ladders."
52,574,"Dec 2 2004	Great Choice	My wife and I spent three nights here and were not disappointed. It was our first visit to London and we found the location to be well suited to our plans. The staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms were clean, breakfast was adequate. Would stay here again."
53,574,"Nov 20 2004	A good choice	I chose BW--Delmere on the basis of reviews on tripadvisor. It was a good choice. This is a small hotel near restaurants and shops. Rooms have internet access, but since I hadn't brought my computer I went to an internet cafe a block away. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the room was small but comfortable and very clean, the continental breakfast was good and plentiful, and the location was great--just two blocks from Paddington station. For me price was the deciding factor. Given the location, the price can't be beat. I arrived three hours before check-in after an overnight flight from the US. I was invited to wait in the lounge while my room was readied. The desk clerk brought a cup of coffee and asked the maid to clean my room first. I was in my room after only 30 minutes.The hotel would not guarantee a non-smoking room, and although I did find an ashtray in a drawer, the room was free of tobacco odor. But one who is especially sensitive to smoke might want to choose a hotel that will guarantee a smoke-free room.I will definitely stay at Best Western Delmere on my next trip to London."
54,574,"Nov 20 2004	Excellent Hotel	If you've been looking on the internet for a good hotel in London at a good price stop looking. This is it. I picked the Delmere based on the good reviews on this page and they are all true. My wife and I were very satisfied with the hotel. The continental breakfast was excellent and the staff was always nice and friendly. In general, all the people in London was very nice and friendly. We had a great vacation in London. Thanks."
55,574,Nov 17 2004	Delmere - A Hidden Gem in London	Your reviewers were right! My husband and I recently spent three nights at the Delmere during our first visit to England. We loved our little room. The staff was so pleasant and helpful. The location was great. Paddington Station was a super place for starting our exploration of London. We would certainly reccommend this hotel to family and friends.
56,574,"Oct 2 2004	Good value for money	We chose this hotel based on the many favourable reviews we read on this page. I can verify that they are accurate and that the Delmere is a charming hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. It is easy to reach on foot from Paddington station, which of course is on the direct link to Heathrow. We did have a problem though with our room being excessively hot, as our stay was during late summer. There was no airconditioning and we could not open the windows because we were on the streetfront, and the traffic noise kept us awake. The duty manager did go to great lengths to relocate us to a quiet room, although this did cost us more. The room was small, and the bathroom roughly the size of an average toilet, but okay for a few nights. Breakfast was very good and very much appreciated. Overall, excellent value for money. Ask for a room in the courtyard downstairs if you are concerned about noise from the street."
57,574,"Sep 30 2004	Accurate reviews for this lovely quaint hotel in a convenient location!	Just came back from a 4-day trip to London. The Delmere hotel was a wonderful choice! It was conveniently located by the Paddington tube station, which is not too far from central London and all the major sights. The Heathrow Express took us directly from the airport to Paddington station within 20 min. The hotel staff was very gracious during our entire stay. Our booking included a daily continental breakfast in their small restaurant, La Perla, which was perfect since eating in London can be VERY expensive! The room was cozy with a clean en-suite bathroom, and was located in the back of the hotel, which was very quiet. Rooms facing the street may be noisy due to street traffic. We would definitely stay here again. Many thanks to tripadvisor.com for the recommendation!"
58,574,"Sep 28 2004	Great place to stay !	The hotel is a small and cosy, and so are the rooms. But they are clean and equipped with the things you need. We even had a little yard with flowers and a bench outside our room ! Much nicer than a carpeted hall...Nice staff and ok breakfast.Location is great too ! Recommended to everyone wanting to stay in a nice affordable place in London !"

60,574,"Jul 10 2004	A Beautiful Hotel right in the Heart of London	Thank you Trip Advisor. This site has been a very good source if you want to book your hotel. This is the second time I used trip advisor. The first was when I went to New York last Aug 2004. I also booked the right hotel because of the comments of this site. Believe me, everything you read here is true.I stayed at Delmere from June 28 to July 7, 2004. Our room was 403 and it was a twin room. Small but very clean room. Comfortable bed and pillows.I read all the reviews first before booking my london hotel since it's my first time to visit london. The hotel is located along sussex garden which is a walking distance from Paddington Station. You only have to ride the Heathrow Express 15 minutes to Paddington. The Hotel is only 3 minutes from the station. Very safe neighborhood. Very Comfortable Hotel. La perla restaurant is where you have your breakfast. There is ham, cheese and an assortment of bread. It's not the usual 5 star hotel breakfast buffet but nevertheless it is enough considering how expensive the food in London.There is an internet shop nearby along london street. A convenience store or &quot;budgens&quot; its the 7 eleven equivalent in London.I really enjoyed my first trip to London. Great hotel, great city, I was able to experience F1 formula racing in the heart of Picadilly circus, 50% off shoppping at Harrods, Gay Pride at Trafalgar Square, West End Plays all happened during the duration of my stay. Wonderful indeed."

1,576,"Oct 15 2009 	Terrible experience	The only plus side is the location.Negative points1 Reception non existence. sit and watch TV or playing games and refuse to help at all. Leaves desk at eight at night then you are stuck. On departure the reception refused to contact taxi service so had to stand in the main road with all luggage to obtain taxi service by stopping taxi as they drive by. Two elderly ladies had to carry their luggage down flights of stairs as the reception refused to render any assistance.2 Rooms terrible stale and not ventilated. Had to finish making up the bead one day out of the 4 days as the bedspread was bundled up in the corner of the room. (this was at nine in the evening on our return to the hotel)Single bed linen on double bed does nor work. We slept more on the mattress as on the sheets and on top of it all the linen had holes in it as well.3 Breakfast What a disaster This hotel do not understand the meaning of continental breakfast. What you get is- A water downed artificial juice which tasted like nothing ever tasted before.- Over Boiled cold eggs as blue as it can be.- Cerials with no taste at all.- Cheese (one variate) slivers so thin that in the event of lifting them they tare apart.- Meat slivers from the lowest grade and standard possible.- Only sliced bread which you had to toast yourself no other option of buns or muffins, fresh fruit or even yogurt available.- One platter of the same cheese and meat every day- Dining room without table cloths and packed with to many tables and chairs for you to move around when 50 % occupied.In conclusionThe world rate South Africa as a 3rd world BUT I can assure you that our one star Hotels are better than this three star dump (hotel)"
2,576,Sep 14 2009 	Clean room decent price	This was a great place to spend our night in transit back to Canada.
3,576,"Jul 18 2009 	Good enough for my 24-hour layover	I had a short layover in London on my way home to the US. It was decent enough for my needs -- clean, well kept, and most importantly for me, it was just around the corner from Paddington station where I had direct access to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. The major drawback, though tolerable for my circumstance, was the lack of elevator. My room was small but since I was alone, I could deal with it. Had there been 2 of us, no way!! I concur with other reviewers about the breakfast. Also, there was no air conditioning. For me, not a big deal as I prefer fresh air. Would I stay there again? Possibly. I think if the hotel offered an in-room mini fridge to where I could store beverages and restaurant leftovers for later snacking, I would be more inclined."
4,576,"Feb 7 2009 	Excellent Value Convenient Location	We stayed at this hotel for one night Jan 19th 2009. It was Room 204 on the second floor at the rear of the hotel so very quiet. Our room had a double and two single beds, although we had only asked for a double, with a small but clean and functional shower room, basin and toilet. Plenty of wardrobe and drawer space, TV, extra pillows and bedding in wardrobe (if needed), very clean and warm.Excellent value for London for the price we paid (38.00 for two people B&amp;B one night via Octopus Travel.com). Located within 5 minutes walk of Paddington station so within easy reach of Central London.The hotel doesn't have a lift and as the breakfast room is in the basement may not be suitable for the elderly or infirm. Breakfast room was quite small and crowded but served a more than adequate cold buffet breakfast - juice (weak), cereals, bread / toast, preserves, cold meat and cheese, hard boiled eggs, tea or coffee.Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Reception staff pleasant and efficient."
5,576,"Nov 3 2008 	Won't come back	I booked The Beverley City hotel as a last minute act of panic. I wish I had chosen any other London hotel.The room was tiny, had a bad smell, the bathroom was filthy (and unhealthy, I am sure), and the breakfast was poor. They ran out of bread 20 minutes before the breakfast ended, and provided no alternatives - there was nothing else to eat."
6,576,"Aug 12 2008 	What a cute little place to stay!	I loved this little hotel! It is easy to find from Paddington station (walking distance) so is very easy to get to from Heathrow airport. It is one little hotel in several similar hotels all in a row, set back from the street. There is no lift so pack light! The hallways, stairwells and rooms are very small and 'English' and I loved that. We stayed in a room for two and you wouldn't have fit three people in the room but it was cosy! The rooms are clean and tidy and the bathroom is tiny but functional. It's not for the fussy travellers because of its size, but we are not very fussy and we loved it! would definately stay there again. There is also a cute little breakfast room downstairs which was excellent too!"
7,576,"Aug 1 2008 	Absolute dump	Do not stay at this hotel! We made the mistake of booking 5 nights here and it was so bad that we left after the first night. In no particular order, the bad points are:1. There is no lift or elevator so if you have large suitcases and are staying on the higher floors, you will either have to lug them up to your room yourself or pay some poor cleaner 5 pounds to help you. The guy at reception will not help in any way.2. The rooms are TINY - one person and one suitcase cannot fit in a twin room at the same time. Also, two single beds will only fit in a twin room if they are pushed together, so don't expect any personal space at night...3. Supposedly 'non-smoking' room smelt terribly of stale cigarettes.4. Guy at reception goes home at 6pm so if you need assistance after that time, you are out of luck!5. There is no ventilation so the rooms are very stuffy.6. There is no 'full English Breakfast' - what you get is reconstituted orange juice, thin pieces of toast and fake jam-type substance to put on it.This place is like many others near Paddington Station - an overpriced dump masquerading as a hotel. Read the other reviews and consider yourself warned!"
8,576,"May 23 2008 	Average hotel terrible breakfast!	Beverley house hotel is the equivalent of a two star property. The ensuite room was average with a small but clean bathroom. The bed was nice and comfortable. However no tea or coffee making facilities and it is a shame the room was not as clean as the bathroom!The breakfast is the worst breakfast i have ever had in any B and B or hotel-watered down cordial orange juice and the choice of three cereals- all of which were very untasty.The hotel is in a pleasant location, near to Lancater Gate tube for easy accessibility around London."
9,576,"Jun 4 2007 	We won't stay here again	On the plus side, the hotel is located on a charming and beautiful tree-lined street, within walking distance to Hyde Park, and only 2 blocks from the Paddington Subway station, and several different lines of surface buses pass by the area. From the hotel, it's very easy and convenient to get to all the other attractions in London, especially by subway. The neighborhood has many restaurants, shops, pubs, and a post office. The rooms are clean and maintained daily. A free breakfast buffet consisting of assorted cheeses and cold cuts, hard boiled eggs, cold cereals, toast, juices, coffee &amp; tea, is available for guests.On the minus side, the rooms are very small, and with luggage, leaves hardly any space to be, other than to prop oneself up on the bed. The bathroom was extremely small and one has to be very careful in moving about, not to bump into things. The hotel does not have an elevator, and our room ended up being on the 3rd floor which meant having to haul our luggage up all the flights of stairs, and each floor consists of two staircases around a very tight turn. One of the clerks at the front desk told me that if they are given advance notice of a handicap or health related problem, they will try to accommodate a guest on the lower floors.We won't stay at the Beverley again, but will try to find something that would be more suitable in this particular neighborhood."
10,576,"Mar 28 2007 	Horrible! Worst hotel experience	I can not exaggerate that I experienced my worst hotel stay at the Beverley. The heating only operates between 6am-12noon &amp; 6pm-12mid. The night we stayed there the outside temp was 6c max. I could not shower in the morning as the water was cold. The room was so small we had nowhere to put our bags. Breakfast was horrible. Toast, cordial, budget quality cereal, slices of cheese, ham &amp; boiled eggs. All self-serve. As we are vego we could only have the toast. We asked for an alternative meal but they would not provide it. Of course we still had to pay for the breakfast. The towels were old &amp; worn. They had the name of their other Hotel situated in the same street. My guess is that the Beverley gets all the old stuff. The pillows had no spring in them at all. I had a terrible nights sleep. We moved out the next day &amp; went to another hotel down the street. It was much, much better &amp; only cost a little more. Of course they will not refund &amp; insist on payment upfront. They have a sign in the room tell patrons that they will not refund. If you are planning on staying there I would strongly suggest checking the room &amp; dining room first."
11,576,"Mar 26 2007	So bad we moved out after day one	We had such a bad experience with the Beverley City Hotel that we moved out after the 1st day. I will not be advising people to stay there.To put it in a nutshell:The heating is on only between 6am-12noon &amp; 6pm-12midnight. That was a little uncomfortable considering the max outside temp was 6c.The room was so small that you could not place a shoe between the bed &amp; the wall. If we placed our bags on the floor we had to step over them as there was nowhere to store them.The bathroom/toilet was so small I had to walk in &amp; back out (no room to turn).There was no tea &amp; coffee in the room. If you wanted a tea/coffee you had to order it from them at a cost.The pillows were very old &amp; completely flat. They had no spring left in them at all.The towels were old &amp; worn. They had the name of their other Hotel on them. I can only assume the Beverley gets all their old stuff.There was no hot water when I went to take a shower in the morning.Breakfast was self serve. It consisted of cordial, toast, 3 choices of cereal (Cornflakes, Rice Bubbles &amp; Coco Pops), thin slices of cheese &amp; ham &amp; boiled eggs. Everything looked low quality. Because we are vego all we could eat was toast (no jams). We asked if we could pay extra &amp; receive a hot breakfast but we were told they could not do that.The dining room was so small that I had to move the table out to let Karen sit down. I had to move it back so I could sit down. The dining room resembled a pauper soup kitchen in my opinion. Judging by the behaviour of the other guests they were not enjoying the experience as well. We have been used to friendly chats &amp; happy people during breakfast at all the other locations."
12,576,Mar 24 2007 	Don't stay here	First room they gave me here (sister hotel to the Nayland) was tiny and the loo didn't work. Reception closed at 6pm but they moved me to another room just before they went off. TV didn't work in new room and windows draughty but okish for price. Went into bathroom at 7.30am next morning and the lock on the door broke. Finally 'released' at 10.50am. No apologies. No refund.
13,576,"Jan 18 2007	Good location but be careful!	The hotel located pretty good, some 200m from Paddington station, where Heathrow Express, four tube lines and three major bus routes are intersected. There are a number of pubs, steak houses and other places to eat around (check out &quot;Sussex Arms&quot; and &quot;The Bear and The Bishop&quot; - the last one is at the 3rd level of Paddington Station, good selection of ales and traditional english food).The hotel is mostly sleep-only, like many others in London. 8 TV channels, 3 of them are in Greek, like columns besides the entrance :) When booking, try to avoid two basement-level rooms, if you are not a hardcore traveller with just basic needs.The breakfast is just average. The room service is surprisingly good (in some manner it was better than in Shanghai 5*). Front desk sfaff is cheerful and helpful."
14,576,Aug 12 2006 	Um????	All the reviews are spot on. The bathroom is TINY. The breakfast room is impossibly cramped. Please note why I am really writing this review - there are NO coffee/tea making facilities in the rooms. They were happy to fill my flask with hot water at the sister Nayland Hotel. I would not stay here again. It was ok - no real complaints. Nicely decorated
15,576,"Jun 14 2006	Why did I listen to the good reviews !?	Despite living in the USA I am British and I felt this hotel had tried too hard to please the American guests (and failed): our room was in a nice old townhouse on a quiet street 3 mins walk from Paddington tube station. It had new cheap matchy matchy (hampton inn style) furnishings, with a new moulded plastic bathroom, a good safe, a hairdryer in the room and breakfast provided. It was tiny, but cheap! Great I said. Then I remembered there is nothing around Paddington - no real restaurants, pubs, shops. The room was far too tiny to chill out in, so just one nice bar nearby for a drink before bed would have been nice. The breakfast was TERRIBLE. I am not a picky eater and would have been happy with 2 slices of toast and a mug of tea, but the tea, jam, bread tasted awful... How could they get all that so wrong? We decided to make tea or coffee in our room and then pick up a croissant from a bakery, but there was no coffeepot/kettle in the room (unheard of for a british traveller). We even tried to get a glass of wine one night from the sister hotel 2-doors down, but the wine was bad and it wasn't so much a bar but a hallway and we felt very uncomfortable there. The walls of our room were thin and I was kept awake, so I decided to sleep in and then discovered there was serious building/demolition work going on from 8am (no-one warned us). I would have moved hotels or gone to stay with friends, but we had to pay for our full stay up front (again unheard of for a british traveller). I would tell the hotel to spend less on matching the curtains to the comforter, and more on the teabags and bread. I would advise you to stay somewhere more lively and on a less convenient tube stop, to get more for your money and a better london experience. Staying close to the British Museum/Convent Garden is often a good option."
16,576,"May 1 2006	Loved the Beverley	The room and bathroom at the Beverley were small but efficient and perfectly adequate for me and my two kids. The location was terrific. The front desk guy was really helpful and nice, as were the breakfast staff. I will definitely stay in the Beverley on future trips to London."
17,576,"Nov 19 2005	Crappy but central	Stayed here for a week actually.Rooms are very small, standard, but ok. The rooms are clean enough. Hotel staff is ok, although we often had to visit the hotel next door for service. (guess they cooperate with the other hotels in the area) Breakfast was terrible. We only went to the breakfast room one morning. And to buy breakfast in an expencive restaurant in London each morning, for a week, increases the budget. Anyway, the breakfast was in a dirty little hole in the basement.Only a 3 minutes walk from paddington station.Would I stay here again? NOT A CHANCE. You can find both cheaper and better than this.Will you ruin your vacation if you`ve already booked? Nope, we had a great week anyway.Enjoy, or not?"
18,576,"Jul 22 2005 	I loved the Beverley hotel!	Hi. I travelled alone about two years ago, and found my stay quite pleasant. I had the free continental breakfast, which offered thefollowing: eggs, toast, jam, cheese, sliced ham, three kinds of cold cereal, grapefruit juice[?], milk, tea, coffee. I also found the rooms small, but packed lightly, only two pieces of luggage. The bathroom was small, but with a shower that does not operate on coins, it is a great deal. I bought a tour package, which ended up with me staying in a room by myself, with, free daily breakfast, t.v., blowdryer, room safe, private bathroom, queen sized bed [comfortable], and good walking distance from the tube and inexpensive restaurants, all for $100 canadian a day.I thought it was great value, and people get what they pay for... withthis hotel I got more than I paid for. I recommend it for people who are able bodied, as seniors with walkers or wheelchairs will find difficulty going up the stairs. There is no elevator, but the price I paid for included VAT as well, so I cannot complain..this is best for starving writers [like myself] or college students, or even honeymooners on a tight budget!"
19,576,"Jun 16 2005	Basics not working in the Beverley House Hotel	The most terrible hotel I ever stayed. The toilet was not working and neither was repaired until 3 days despite my request and complain. The sheets were not changed, not after the previous hotel guest, and not during the following days. Of course many other things were just ordinary, but as a whole, the hotel management didnt take it seriously to provide the basics for the guests."
20,576,"Jan 7 2005	dump	I can't believe this hotel gets 2 stars it should only get half a star! We had to wait for our room to be ready, even though we didn't show up early for check in. The staff is incompetent or has an attitude, when there is staff around because they also spend time at another nearby hotel. Therefore, no 24 hour reception, and having to wait long to check out. The rooms are tiny, there isn't enough room for a decent sized microne. They don't keep in mind that tourists stay at hotels, and we need room for our luggage. They forget to bring you towels, which are sometimes torn, yuck. We found a cockroach, double yuck! Their rich breakfast buffet is the worst I've ever had (how can you call tang orange juice). I can go on but thinking back on this place is making me sick."
21,576,Apr 26 2009 	Cambiate subuto hotel se potete

23,576,Aug 19 2006 	agreable sejour
1,578,Nov 10 2009 	Numerous stairs awful even after being guaranteed a lower floor room	We enjoyed Kevin and his interesting take on the local scene. He was a gracious host.The breakfast selection was fine and the food was nicely presented.We had requested a room on the lower floors because my wife had just gone through a complete knee replacement. Unfortunately that did not work out. And on our return trip late in our trip we were relegated to an even higher floor after making a request for the lowest floor. We did have very noisy neighbors on our first visit and had to beat on the wall at 3 am for them to get quiet.
2,578,"Oct 29 2009 	Highly Recommended!	My husband and our 23 year old daughter stayed here for 3 nights in Room #8 with one double bed and one twin and private bath. While the room and bath were small, it was very clean and comfortable. The shower was tiny, but the hot water and good pressure made up for it. The innkeeper Kevin was a great guy. He found us a taxi to Heathrow for almost the same amount as the Heathrow Express. Breakfast was included and provided a good start to the day. The area seemed relatively safe and was within easy walking distance to the Pimlico and Victoria stations. We actually walked from Vauxhall with luggage without difficulty. (P.S. I got a better rate by writing to Kevin directly rather than going through any of the websites online.)"
3,578,"Oct 9 2009 	Would definitely stay again!	We had a wonderful 9 night stay at Blades Hotel. Kevin and the staff were fabulous - friendly, helpful, and so pleasant. Our room was very comfortable and incredibly quiet. The location was perfect - just a few blocks from a Tube station and a bus stop almost right at the door. The value was amazing - we couldn't have asked for anything more!"
4,578,"Oct 3 2009 	Same postcode as the Queen!	We booked this hotel because of its location. A previous review rated the location as 'poor' - so the Queen live in a poor location as she shares same postcode? Really silly question. Very clean hotel, not 5 star but that reflects in room rates. Great buffet breakfast and very good staff who make the stay very pleasant. Advice on events and hotels from a guy who seems to run the place. No lifts so ask for a lower floor if a problem -i t is a period building. The best bed and breakfast hotel we have stayed in a capital city. Local transport - BRILLIANT!"
5,578,"Sep 3 2009 	Refurbishment Required-Tiny Room	The external appearance is fine-once you are inside it all goes wrong. The overall decor is poor and our tiny room located 4 flights up was very poor.Holes in the wall,holes in the curtain,holes in the towels.The lock on our bedroom door required much attention to make it work,it looked as if it had been broken into and then badly repaired.The shower was pathetic.On the positive side the sheets were clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable but not good enough to change our overall view -would we return-NO WAY"
6,578,"Aug 21 2009 	A friedly gem	We have stayed at Blades several times, and enjoy returning there. Kevin's friendly attention in the (non-cooked but excellent) breakfast room is a highlight. Drawbacks are the steep stairs - especially on the top floor, and the occasional need to seek help with the shower taps, but everything is there - if one asks! Very convenient for bus and tube."
7,578,Jul 28 2009 	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Blades Hotel.	We like to stay in this location when we go to London and this year left booking til very late but were lucky to get into this hotel. Keven and the staff made the stay very enjoyable indeed. We were lucky &lt;haha&gt; to get one of the top floor rooms and as Kevin said by the time we reached the top with our luggage we would have &quot;faith&quot;. For those who cannot do steps it is something to consider when booking. For us it simply gave us some more exercise. The rooms are VERY clean and have everything you need. Everything was in good working order. There is a lovely place on the 3rd level I believe for you to sit in an open concept room and enjoy the day or evening. We would definetly book at the Blades Hotel now instead of the other hotel where we usually stay.
8,578,Jul 11 2009 	Excellent	Kevin great mine host. Room large clean and welcoming. great location. Breakfast all you could need with Kevin on hand to help with sightseeing and easy transport. would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a break in London
9,578,Jul 2 2009 	Great location personal service	Spent five wonderful nights at the Blades with my husband and two teens. Room was small but adequate - typical of European hotels. Kevin was great and the personal touch by him and his staff was terrific. Breakfast was great and includes cheese and meat but nothing hot. The only thing I would change is to provide some variety in the breakfast buffet for those of use who spent more than 2 or 3 days in the hotel. Wifi was available but didn't always work very well.Would definitely stay at the Blades again and would recommend to others.
10,578,"Jun 29 2009 	Will return!	Kevin and his staff were welcoming and friendly. Upper floor rooms were very quiet, even with windows open all night. Breakfast was a friendly affair with other travelers exchanging ideas. The teen shoppers were thrilled with Kevin's suggestions. More like a B&amp;B than cookie cutter hotel, and perfect for a family."
11,578,"Jun 13 2009 	Great value for money	I would reccomend the hotel it's great if your staying in London for a few days. I stayed with a group of friends it was all our first time in London and the tube stike was on when we were their but we still found it really easy to get around and the hotel was pretty central.The room was cosy but it was clean,would have been better if the towles were replaced daily but overall I was pleased with the room.The staff were lovely and very helpfull I would use the hotel again next time I'm in London."
12,578,"May 31 2009 	A good location for a city trip	Some disappointment with this hotel, which although very well sited for a city break to London, was more of a B&amp;B, than a hotel.The room was clean and of an adequate size.Tea &amp; coffee facilities were available but had to be picked up from a cupboard. Nowhere to safely plug in kettle.A change of towels was only &quot;permitted&quot; every three days! Despite our leaving very damp towels out in the bathroom after the second day, on returning to our room the next afternoon and finding the same damp towels hung again on the non heated towel rail!!The breakfast although continental, was limited.Very close to Pimlico underground.No lift so beware of the stairs."
13,578,"Apr 5 2009 	Location hospitality - the Blades has it all	Prior to leaving for London I did exhaustive research on hotels in the city. I became more and more apprehensive about where to lodge after reading so many bad reviews of almost every hotel. Price and location didn't seem to matter. We finally booked a room at the Blades Hotel (which did have quite a few good reviews) but in spite of this I think I held my breath all the way from Memphis to London in anticipation of what we might find when we arrived. Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised upon arriving at a quaint, clean, 19th century establishment. The room was spacious enough for my husband and myself (no large storage drawers but did have clothes rack with hangers) , the ensuite shower was full size with plenty of hot water and good water pressure (the sink was tiny but cute and served it's purpose) and we were lucky enough to get a room with french doors opening onto a small balcony (no patio furniture but the view of the street and the night breeze were nice). The daily breakfast was wonderful and included crumpets, toast, cheese, yogart, granola, fruit, cereal, juice, cold turkey and ham, and coffee and tea (I may have forgotten one or two items). Although I love most things English I couldn't have suffered the traditional fry up that some B&amp;B's offer. Best of all was our host, Kevin. He communicated with me prior to our arrival (which helped set my mind at ease) and was a most pleasant,cordial host throughout our stay. One of my fondest memories of our trip are our breakfast conversations with Kevin and the other guests, whether advising us about our sightseeing plans, discussing history or enlightening us with stories of England and the Royal Family. There is no lift but we were able to stay on one of the lower floors. The heating was very adequate. I'm not sure if the hotel is airconditioned. We stayed there in March when we didn't need it. There is no 24 hours reception but we advised Kevin of any needs at breakfast (car hire for the airport, etc.) and our request was handled swiftly. During our stay we encountered three other visitors from the states. One of them had been there one week and had already changed hotels three times and the other two were staying at places that they didn't sound too enamored of and were paying quite a bit more than we were. Having a good place to stay put our fears to rest and allowed us to really enjoy our stay. We are so grateful that we choose The Blades. I only hope that we can return so that we can stay there again and we would certainly recommend it to anyone. From all that we had read and heard about concerning hotels in London we feel like we found a treasure!"
14,578,"Mar 7 2009 	The Blades Hotel is brilliant!	On our first morning in London, Kevin, the wonderfully witty manager of the Blades Hotel, marched our group of four plus several of his other guests off past Buckingham Palace for &quot;something we must see&quot;. It was only a short walk (the hotel is wonderfully located) and Kevin kept us entertained the whole way. We stopped just down from the palace at the edge of a small group of people. Minutes later, cars started arriving carrying various members of the Royal Family. In short order, THE ENTIRE ROYAL FAMILY (the Queen, Prince Charles, Princes William, Edward and Harry, etc., etc. etc.) showed up to unveil a statue of the Queen Mother. Had any other hotel manager taken the time to walk his guests to this once-in-a-lifetime event? Absolutely not and that's why Kevin and The Blades Hotel in London gets our highest possible recommendation."
15,578,"Feb 16 2009 	Great Hotel	My daughter and I have now enjoyed two weekends in London and have used Blades Hotel on each occasion. The hotel is in an excellent location being vey good for transport links to all the tourist attractions/sights. The rooms are clean and the staff are very helpful. Breakfast is provided and very good with a selection of fruit, cereal, choice of breads, cold meat and cheese. The addition of crumpets is a nice touch. We were very well looked after both times and would not hesitate to recommend others to try the hospitality extended to guests at Blades"
16,578,"Jan 29 2009 	Great Family Hotel	Traveling with 3 young children to London can be a daunting task. It's great to know that when you arrive at the Blades Hotel you've found a comfortable home for the week. The Blades has one of London's few family rooms that actually will accommodate a family of 5. You trade off a hallway bathroom (private to the room), but it's more than made up for by the clean and comfortable room that fits a family and all your belongings. The convenience of being 3 minutes from the blue line on the tube and half-a block from the bus stop is tremendous. All of this is topped off by the friendly staff. Our youngest child considered the manager, Kevin - who welcomes you to breakfast each morning, one of the highlights of her trip. Breakfast is served in an intimate dining room, with a nice selection of choices. The guests were from all over Europe which makes for an educational and very international experience. The staff was very kind to the children, helpful for touring tips and went out of their way to help with my internet needs. They even decorated with red/white/blue balloons and signs for the presidential inauguration. I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and agree with the many positive postings that led us to book here. Highly recommend."
17,578,"Dec 29 2008 	Great little hotel in an excellent location!	I was traveling to London for the World Travel Market Show and my husband wanted to tag along. Since he and my 5-year-old daughter hadn't seen London, I brought them along so they could sightsee while I worked. The Blades Hotel met all our needs. Very close to the Victoria Tube station, which is a hub for many lines, the Blades is a great neighborhood in Kensington--close to restaurants, transport and shopping. The staff is all lovely: very friendly and accommodating. Kevin, the proprietor, takes good care to help you make the most of your trip. For example, my husband was going to take my daughter up to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. Kevin suggested that she might be more interested in seeing the changing of the Horse Guard, which is just as beautiful, but with better access and a clearer vantage point for a small child. He was right. As for the accommodations, the rooms are clean and well appointed. Breakfasts are simple but quality. We will definitely stay here again (Note: While this hotel is highly recommended, note that it is &quot;low frills&quot;. So if you're looking for a chocolate on your pillow, stay elsewhere. But if you want a well-located, clean, friendly and comfortable (and well-priced) hotel, the Blades is your place.)"
18,578,"Dec 11 2008 	Great budget hotel	If you want a reasonably priced hotel which is clean, friendly and close to a tube station look no further than this one. It is always a bit of a risk choosing a budget hotel in London but this one will not disappoint as long as you appreciate that you are getting what you pay for. If you want 5 star go and pay over the odds somewhere else but otherwise this is excellent value for money.From check in to check out the staff could not have been more helpful, the room was clean and a good size and the bathroom, though small, was perfectly adequate.Breakfast was a jovial experience with Kev telling jokes and imparting his vast knowledge of London to his guests. There was very much a family atmosphere even to the extent that he produced a cake with candles for a litttle girl who was celebrating her 8th birthday and we all sang 'Happy Birthday'. Great fun. There was a good choice of cereals, cheese, cold meat, bread and crumpets to choose from so no need to go hungry.All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel both for convenience (it is only a 5 minute walk from Pimlico tube station) and value. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
19,578,"Dec 6 2008	Great location spotless great staff	We enjoyed a room for 4 nights. There were 3 of us for 1 night and 2 for the other three and we were able to stay in the triple for the price of the double which was great so we didn't have to pack up and move. The bedroom and bathroom were spotless, beds comfortable, view was nice. Breakfast was good with excellent service and converstion from Kevin. Lydia was helpful and sweet during checkin. Location is wonderful, easy walk from Victoria Station and Pimlico Underground. Bus 24 , which runs up through Trafalgar square, stopped half a block away and the area seemed safe at night. Local restaurants including a Pizza Express and a Tapas bar were really tasty. Thanks for a great stay! We'll be back."
20,578,"Aug 26 2008 	Great experience Loved Kevin	We stayed 2 nights at Blades after recommendation from this site and others. We had the family room on the main floor and it was perfect for us. The hotel appeared clean and breakfast was great. We mentioned to Kevin that we were going to Paris on the Eurostar the next morning and he offered to hale a cab for us. He told us to come to breakfast at 6:30 and we would need to take a cab at about 7:15 to make our train. Breakfast is not usually served until 7:00, but he said just come down early. He was reallly great, we really enjoyed our stay there at Blades hotel."
21,578,"Aug 17 2008	Would definately stay again	My daughter and I went to London for the first time and was looking for a place that was reasonable and close to the tourist attractions. The Blades Hotel was just what the doctor ordered; not only was the staff great but the other guests were friendly and it was more of a family atmosphere than a hotel atmosphere. We stayed eight days with no regrets.Kevin and Lydia were the perfect hosts and we were treated as family. This is a Victorian Hotel that is not ultra modern or ultra swank but if you are looking for a nice, clean and safe place to stay this is the place for you. Our intention was not to spend much time in our room and we did not. Public transporation is just a short walk away both the bus and underground. Musems, the Palace and other London Landmarks are within walking distance.I was not disappointed because I did take into account all the reviews on this site. For us there were no surprises. I am planning to return to London in the not too distant future and I will not hesitate to stay at the Blades again."
22,578,"Aug 12 2008 	A little shabby but did the job!	Recently stayed at Blades for a weekend and on first impressions thought the hotel was adequate.We had the last room available which was a single room with a double bed and there was enough room for both of us. The room was clean but it really smelt of Garlic! The smell was so strong we kept the window open day and night! The bed was lumpy and could of done with renewing. The room did not have a hairdryer and tea and coffee facilities as advertised and therefore didn't take a hairdryer with me so that was a bit inconvenient! The bathroom was ok with a good power shower which was welcome after a long day in the big smoke!The breakfast was basic but there was plenty of it and set us up for the day. The staff were friendly and helpful, the manager was always up for a laugh and making jokes, very amusing!So basically it catered for our needs as all we wanted was somewhere to sleep at the end of the night. If you want luxury then probably not ideal but otherwise a good base for sightseeing and very reasonsible in price."
23,578,"Jun 25 2008 	Excellent value for money	I was very impressed. The location is fantastic (a 15-minute walk and you're at the Houses of Parliament), and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The hotel is located in an old house, but it's well kept-up and my room had modern and perfectly adequate fittings (the bathroom, especially, was new and clean). My room was quite tiny, but I believe most are larger (mine was a special one in the mezzanine which was going for cheaper rates just because of its smallness). And tiny or not, I had an en suite bathroom and plenty of those little extras that make for a comfortable stay (coffee-making equipment, sachets of shampoo, a TV, etc.). Oh, and it was perfectly clean. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the bed, which was a bit lumpy, but nothing too bothersome.What else? Breakfast was also really nice, with good food and plenty of variety, check-in and check-out were a breeze and the staff allowed me to leave my luggage there until the afternoon the day I checked out. Highly recommended!"
24,578,"Jun 23 2008 	Overall not impressed	Last June I made my 4th trip to London. I had always stayed in the Sussex Gardens area and I had spent the first 3 nights of this trip in Sussex Gardens before going to Normandy and Paris. I returned to London from Paris and decided to spend my last 2 nights at the Blades Hotel, based on glowing reviews on this and other travel sights.I was disappointed with my room at the Blades. It was at the very top of the building at the end of a long climb of stairs. The room was shabby and in need of a good cleaning. It was very stuffy and the small fan provided served only to blow the dust bunnies around. There was no screen in the window and opening the window was an invitation for the flies to occupy the room. Getting some sleep was not easy.On the positive side I did enjoy the breakfast room and the selection of food available. The only staff I encountered were two very young girls, who were very polite and helpful.I am returning to London this September and I will be going back to the Sussex Gardens area."
25,578,"Jun 10 2008	Comfortable beds	Blades Hotel makes up for the tiny bathroom with the hospitality of it's staff and the very comfortable beds. In fact, I was told I was only the second person to sleep on the beds in our room, so they are quite new. Most beds on our 7-country trip were hard, but not these, they were comfortably soft, so it was the best sleep I got on my entire trip! I also enjoyed the breakfast and opportunity to ask touristy questions, plus looking around teh sunroom. The staff bend over backwards to help--especially the feather-light lady who carried our very heavy luggage up the stairs (!) , handed us an informational sheet all about the neighborhood, set us up with a pot of tea for our room, and told us where we could grab a bite to eat. The room is done up nicely for a budget hotel and has a traditional English feel with the chinz drapes. Another reviewer mentioned the lack of closet, but the closet rod is in a open area like the bay of a bay window. I thought the open space made the small room feel bigger, and I liked the tin ceiling. I truly feel that, other than gaining more space, the hotel is at its best."
26,578,"Jun 2 2008 	The Blades is the ""Cutting Edge""	Cute, little hotel. Wonderful staff. Located close to an underground station. Good breakfast each morning. We had the 2nd floor balcony just above the Blades sign. It was a good sized room and suited our needs."
27,578,"Dec 26 2007	Great location and more	We were recommended by friends in Orlando who stayed before to go to the Blades Hotel. It lacks elevators and some other modernisation as it a late Victorian house converted to a hotel but it is a really clean and friendly with a brilliant location. While were there there was the royal State Opening of Parliament and the hotel manager, Kevin, took all the guests to a great spot on the route of the Queen's procession to Westminster - a sensational day. Our room was a moderate size and the breakfast was a time to plan the day with advice been given on theatres and places to visit. Certainly will stay there again and recommend it to family and friends."
28,578,"Aug 5 2007	Less than a budget hotel. I'd say a bit above camping.	We read the reviews at great length on TripAdvisor and even heard this property was in one of Rick Steves books. We knew it was a budget hotel but nothing prepared us for what we experienced. To give you a sense of our comparison, a budget hotel to us would be one like Motel 6  Blades was well below that. Id rank the property a bit over camping  certainly not a budget hotel in American standards. And we paid nearly $200 per night there.First the good and there's not much hereThe location was great. Near 2 tube stops. However, most of London to be easy to get around in from almost anywhere  but Victoria Station is a major thoroughfare and convenient as all other reviews stated.. There are many budget properties in this area  not sure how they were to stay at, but there seems to be many options. In addition, we had a problem with tickets to the theater that we couldnt use and the staff offered to post a notice about that. Here are the issues we encountered with Blades:*There is no air conditioning in the hotel, so our windows were open. One of the windows had to be held up by a book as it did not remain open on its own. Also, it rained 3 out of the 5 days we were in London and so the room was somewhat damp. *It was noisy at night. We stayed on the fist floor in the back of the hotel and on an alley. We heard animal noises most nights. * We were given a bath towel and a hand towel for each of us. There were 4 of us in the room. The towels were supposed to be changed every 3 days. The towels we received were frayed and thin. With only one rack outside the bathroom and 2 hooks to hold the towels (enough for 3 towels to be held and aired out to dry) and the humidity in the room, we were never able to completely dry the towels out. *Although our towels should have been changed on the 3rd day, they werent. I believe we only had one set our entire stay. We were at the property 5 days. Had we had a new set, we would have had dry towels on our 3rd day. This was not the case.* Cleaning service did not come one day. By the time we returned to our room and realized they didn't clean, it was too late to do anything.*There is only one key given to us for the room. There were 4 of us and we split up on occasion. The one(s) without the key had to ring the bell to get an employee to open the Main door. There are no phones in the rooms so you couldnt call your party to open the main door.* The sink drained very slowly. We had to constantly turn the water off while washing or brushing our teeth so as not to flood the floor (which of course, we couldnt have wiped up, as we had a limited ration of towels).*There was no closet and not cabinet or dresser to put our clothes in. I have added a picture of the rod that was up against one wall and out in the open. This was what was to be used to hang clothes. In a room for 4 there were 10 hangers upon our arrival. We requested more and got them with no problem, but the rod was still too small for all of our items. We were there for 5 days and had to live out of our luggage. *Breakfast was very basic and open until 9:00. This isnt 9:00 American standard where you can come in at 9:00 and be served. It meant that at 9:00 they began clearing away the food. You needed to come down and finish by 9:00. Just something worth noting.*On one occasion, we requested information about the theater district. I know the staff arent supposed to be concierges however, we where led to the pay phone and told we could find our answer by calling out of the phone book. We didnt even know where to start.* Our window never completely shut. It was on an angle so that there was always an open gap.* We had a flight at 7:00 in the morning and needed to be at the airport at 4:00am. We abided by the request of the hotel to have them order the taxi the day before. The day before at breakfast, we did request a taxi from one of the ladies who worked in the hotel. Just out of a whim, I also asked for the phone number so we could confirm. Low and behold at midnight when we returned to our room and I checked in the with taxi company I learned no cab was ordered for us nor available. I then called the manager/owner who took care of getting us another taxi. So glad she was there and answered the phone. Another taxi came early in the morning. Had I not called to confirm, we might have not gotten to the airport on time. We only received 3 hours of sleep that night.* The owner/manager of the property told us the fare for the taxi would be 38 pounds. When our driver got to us, he turned the meter on and told us that any cab before 6:00 in the morning did not offer the 38 pound fare -- it was instead 72 pounds!When we left the lady in charge, Noreen knew about our problems and offered a 2 night complementary stay on our next visit. As we would never stay at this property again, I instead asked her to credit us on our June trip. I was told that wasnt going to happen. Noreen felt that I should have highlighted more of our issues to her throughout our stay so she could have fixed them.. Its a wonder she felt that there were enough problems to offer us free nights on our next visit but wouldnt take care of this one. We would never go back to this hotel!Overall, we were very disappointed in the property. We came off a 2 1/2 week trip finishing in London, which turned out to be quite a let down. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we were expecting a warm welcome, assistance with our London trip, clean hotel and a small bathroom. We did receive the small bathroom; yet the other things expected were not there."
29,578,"Jul 24 2007 	Not as good as wrote in the reviews	We stayed in Blades for 3 nights and there were bed bugs. Although the manager moved us to another room for the last night, he didn't apologize for the problem and kept saying that they never had the problem before and suggest we probably got beaten somewhere. The sheets and towels were not changed everyday but every 3 days. So if you stay there for 3 nights, you'll just get fresh towels on the first day. The breakfast was ok but pretty basic. As the reviews said, the manager entertain the guests every morning during breakfaster; it was nice, but we don't pay 100 just for jokes. The hotel is at a decent location, which is very near to the Pimlico station on the Victoria line. There are plenty of B &amp; Bs on the same road so keep your choice open."
30,578,"Mar 13 2007 	Good Hotel Does What It Says on the Tin	We stayed the second weekend in March 07 for 2 nights. The Hotel is literally 3 minutes walk from Pimlico Underground station, which gives quick access to the centre of London, Victoria Railway station is one stop up the line! We received a warm welcome from the Staff, who where friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were very clean along with the bedding and the En-suite Showeroom. The room we had (1st floor) was a good size in relation to the price paid, it gave you enough room to move about without falling over each other. The En-suite Showeroom was all you needed and worked for us, however was very small and could be a challenge for above average to large sized people! The Breakfast was good with a selection of different cereals, breads cold meats and cheese etc. The only thing we felt missing that we like to see in a continental breakfast would be some croissants / fresh pastries, otherwise it was good! In relation to the prices of other hotels we looked at in London this hotel was good value for money, clean, with good transport links to the rest of the city, we would happily stay here again!!"
31,578,Nov 30 2006 	Clean convenient and friendly	We received a warm and helpful reception from the manager. The room was small and the bath even smaller but sufficient for our needs. The Underground was only 2 blocks away and the 24 Bus was just out the front door. Wonderful coffeeshop around the corner along with a friendly Spanish restaurant and nifty pizza place. All in all a good value in incredibly expensive London.
32,578,"Nov 13 2006	Typical European Hotel	We loved the manager (he entertained us at breakfast every day, which was basic fare, but decent and free). But, one woman in particular was not very pleasant. There is no lift in the hotel and there are 5 &quot;stories&quot; - so beware. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are very small, but like the manager said - this is Europe. If you want large accomodations then stay in America. Overall extremely average, but with the incredible prices in London, not unbearable."
33,578,"Nov 9 2006	A very nice stay	Just called in off the street looking for somewhere to stay and was offered a room immediately.Very comfortable hotel and room. The service from the reception was very personal and welcoming. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had one of the best night's sleep I have ever had outside of my own home.Convenient location and it was very quiet too.Next morning there was a generous breakfast including fresh fruit, ham and cheese and a choice of cereals and juices. All supplied fresh and not from a machine.Would stay again. Dr J Penney"
34,578,"Oct 7 2006 	Saintly service	I am embarrassed that it has taken me so long to write this review given the remarkable stay we experienced at the Blades. My husband and I toured London for 4 days prior to our wedding in Inverness. London, notorious for outrageous hotel prices, offers few acceptable budget options. We found the Blades a perfect fit - great location, great price, great breakfast, clean, and nice people. We discovered just how nice when my wedding dress, shipped in advance of our arrival, failed to turn up. Online and American postal systems were unable to find it and could provide us with no useful information. Kevin, the Blades' manager, immediately sprung into action, spent a ridiculous amount of time on the phone, and was able to locate my dress at an airport outside of the city held up in customs. Having no knowledge of the intricacies of the British postal service and customs, we would have never been able to find the dress on our own. This is the type of service I expect but rarely receive at a 4 star hotel. We cannot thank Kevin enough for his generousity. We hope to return to London soon and will most certainly choose to stay at the Blades."
35,578,"Jul 15 2006	One star: Wouldn't recommend to a friend	We stayed there five days in June 2006 in a double. First, it was hot in London. And, our room was on the top floor (no elevator by the way.) 1) Loud and hot: The window was a single pane glass. So at night, it was so loud that we couldn't sleep until 3AM when people outside started going to bed, and traffic died down. And, it was so hot with no A/C that we couldn't even get comfortable. After walking around London and sightseeing for 12 hours per day, you want to be able to go back to an air conditioned room. So, we sweated all day, and went home and sweated at night. It was miserable. 2) Terrible bed: The bed was like a foam stuffed bag with springs sticking into us. It was probably the cheapest bed that they could find. 3) Dirty towels and linens: The towels were about as thin and cheap as a one star in the United States. To make matters worse, they didn't wash them for three days. So you had to hang up your dirty towels to dry every day. The U.K. law for Hotels is to wash at least every three days in London. So, Blades does the bare minimum required by law. 4) Tiny bathroom. This bathroom was obviously an add on. So what you have is a small bedroom room about 12 feet by 9 feet. And inside that room is a tiny shower/toilet: about 5 feet by 2.5 feet. 5) Non-English staff. If you want an English B&amp;B experience you can't get it at Blades. The staff is not from England. Nothing wrong with the people, however, if you are in London, you want to have someone who has lived there their whole life to give you tips and interesting conversation. The owner/manager Kevin made a cameo appearance one day. He is great, but not around. 6) location: It is not by Victoria Station, it is one stop after Victoria station. Since you will use the Tube everyday to go to Westminister or the Tower, you should stay near Westminister. That way you can save the $9/day on Tube tickets for two people. Add that to the cost of the Hotel room and it is about $155/ night. So for the same price or perhaps $20 more, you can stay in an air conditioned 3-4 star hotel with washed towels, elevator, comfortable bed, and a good nights sleep. It is ridiculous to stay at Blades for that price when you can get comfort for the same price on the other side of the Thames in Westminister. 7) Breakfast was lame: I don't know why they advertise a &quot;hearty breakfast&quot; - it is essentially Wheaties, yougurt, bread, and some canned mixed fruit. The meat is ham cold cuts. Yum. 8) customer service: when we complained it was too hot, and loud to sleep the young lady working there immediately blamed us. She said, &quot;why don't you wear earplugs? Aren't you tired from walking all day? You should have no problem sleeping - you must not be walking enough.&quot; Meanwhile, we walked 12 hours per day, and the room was sweltering. She did move us though to the back of the house which was much quieter."
36,578,"Jun 30 2006	Just Right!	We were absolutely delighted with the Blades Hotel! If you want a clean, quiet room with comfortable beds and aren't looking for frills, this place is for you. Our family of four felt right at home from the moment Lydia checked us in. Four nights later, we were sad to leave, and had no regrets whatsoever with our decision to stay here. We would highly recommend it to families visiting London."
37,578,"May 27 2006	Worked for us	We were happy to have experienced a real British hotel. A great location for walking or tube. Small, yes but typically so. We did speak to an English traveller who repeatedly uses the hotel when in London. We rebooked for a couple nights after a side trip. Our second room was one with a sink you could rest your head on when on the toilet. Wouldn't work if you are overweight. But the beds and furnishing were adequate; I called it much better than camping. We just didn't want to spend more than 79 pounds. The continental breakfast was fine. Only saw the manager once, but the two young workers were very pleasant. We went to the White Swan on Vauxhall Bridge Road nearby for pub food. It has a non-smoking area, which many don't."
38,578,"Sep 7 2005	For the price this hotel is a fabulous place to stay in the heart of London	My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Blades hotel Aug. 27-31, and we thoroughly enjoyed everything about the place. First of all, it's in an absolutely ideal location - just a short walk to Victoria Station. Since we love to walk cities, we walked everywhere. Buckingham Palace was perhaps a 15-20 minute walk and there's lots to see right in that area. The owner, Noreen, and Kevin, the Manager were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Kevin adds a lot of spice to your stay and is always cheerful. In another review, the person states the bathrooms are small but I didn't find that they were so small. They are quite standard based on other hotels we've stayed in. The sheets and towels were crisp and clean and the room was very clean - something that's of utmost importance to me. We loved London and will be going back and there is no doubt that we will stay at the Blades Hotel again. If you do stay there, check out the following restaurants just a few blocks from the Blade Hotel: Jomuna at 74 Wilton Road; it's wonderful Indian cuisine and reasonably priced (prior to going to London I did not eat Indian food at all - I'm now a convert!) and SeaFresh at 80-81 Wilton Road for excellent fish - we were told this is where the locals go. You will not be disappointed in the Blades Hotel if you're looking for something reasonably priced ($135/night) in the heart of London."
39,578,"Aug 26 2005	great place to stay!	We stayed at the Blades Hotel on 2 separate nights during our trip to England. The room and bathroom were very small, but clean. You basically get what you pay for. We asked for a single room with double bed ensuite (the smallest that they have) to accomodate 2 people, and it was fairly adequate for us. The only downside was that it was at the top of the hotel and we had to walk up 8 flights of stairs. Be sure to pack light or not to have any difficulty with walking! The breakfast was tasty and there was a good selection of buffet foods."
40,578,"Mar 14 2005	Great location 	My friend and I just returned from 4 nights in London at Blades. We found the facilities fully adequate for our budget, and the staff at Blades to be extremely helpful.Prior reviews noted concerns about sheets and towels not being changed with the same frequency as anticipated per US standards. Upon check-in, we received a sheet which detailed their policy (in accordance with the British Automobile Association ratings) and this did not cause us any problems. While our room was ample, the bathroom was somewhat small by American standards, but extremely clean and newly-refurbished. Both Kevin the manager and Michael the owner were extremely friendly and eager to make suggestions to improve our time in London. The location of the hotel in the Pimlico area was very convenient to the Underground and breakfast was delicious. Since London was extremely expensive, take advantage of the breakfast at Blades and you will save money on lunches!"
41,578,"Feb 12 2005	Great Hotel	Stayed at the Blades for 6 nights in July 2004. It was great, the staff friendly and very helpful. Kevin the manager, was most accomadating in allowing us to store some extra stuff while we were off to Paris for a week. Furthermore, he was very entertaining during breakfast and gave great advice as to how to get to Waterloo Station. (cab, not public transportation), what to see and what not to waste time on.  Yes, the rooms are small and the baths even smaller and the TV is miserable, but it's london. The Best Western two blocks away was 3 times the price and I suspect the room were not much bigger."
42,578,Jan 13 2005	I might stay here again	The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating and the rooms were spacious. My only complaint is that the bathroom and room were not the cleanest and towels had an odd smell. The hotel was fine for one night but I might think twice about staying there for an extended period of time.
43,578,"Nov 10 2004	I don't think I would stay there again	My husband and me just came back from our little London vacation. We spent 5 nights at the Blades Hotel (near the Victoria station). I would like to share few comments with the others, because for us it was an unpleasant surprise.1.When we arrived we discovered that there are no phones in the rooms. We were irritated because by paying $136 per night (may be not horribly expansive, but still not very cheap) we did not expect that have a phone in the room should be a problem.2.We have stayed in a number of Europeans hotels, but I have never seen such a tiny bathroom. In order to pull up your pants or if you need to dry yourself up with a towel after the shower, you have to open the door into the room, because its not possible otherwise.3.We stayed there for 5 nights and our bed sheets were not changed even ones (!!!)The towels were changed on the 4th day of our stay (!!!). Of course there are some good things to say: location is perfect, breakfast is good, staff is friendly and helpful."

1,591,Jul 25 2009 	Perfect	We spent 10 days in a large 2 bedroom flat. The place was very clean and modern.The service was great. Exactly what we needed for our vacation in London. Just perfect (there's no A/C which for us was no issue as weather was great).	
2,591,May 28 2009 	Second stay - just as good as the first	True to the statement in my previous review
3,591,Feb 27 2009 	Lovely little studio apartment in perfect location	A perfect little studio apartment

6,591,Apr 3 2007 	Great location near St Pauls and very comfortable alternative to Hotels!	We stayed as a group of 4 in a 2 bedroom apartment here for a weekend in March 07
7,591,Jan 20 2007 	A week at the Wardrobe	I just got back from a week in the kings wardrobe in London.Pros:Bigger than a hotel room for a similar cost. (Kitchen
1,593,"Nov 15 2009 	A reasonable hotel	Stayed at the Britannia Hampstead for 2 nights as part of a London Theatre Break, Good location. 20 mins on the tube direct from theatre land. Good buiffet breakfast and a good sized clean room."
2,593,"Oct 24 2009 	Must be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.	In desperate need of refurbishment. Public areas dull &amp; tired. Rooms filthy, furniture must have come from the skip. Only attempted breakfast once after being frog marched to reception to pay again despite being inclusive of my reservation - dinner looked awful. Very busy with cheap tour guests - unlucky them! Only bonus was location. Stay here only as a last resort."
3,593,"Oct 21 2009 	A little dated but clean and accommodating	I booked 7 rooms for 5 nights when we were working at Regents Park, the rooms were comfortable but a bit full of flowered wallpaper and chandeliers. The staff were friendly and welcoming if a little slow at times. The lifts are a bit scary though it feels like they have broken. An upgrade would vastly improve this establishment, however, you get what you pay for and we were very pleasantly surprised.The parking is a bit of a nightmare, get there early and be prepared to move cars around. There is plenty of parking nearby though if you are getting up early. The pubs and restaurants nearby are great. All in all a good bargain! The bar stayed open until we left which wasn't that late."
4,593,Oct 12 2009 	Cleanlines is NOT their strong point	Just returned from The Brittania Hotel and the hotel was not impressive. We were given two rooms the an interconnecting door. We opened the door and could smell stale urine. There was still urine in the toilet from the previous guests. The I had a trple room for myself and two daughters. It was a twin room with an extra bed squeezed in. Hardly any room to move and it was a bedstead with a 2 inch mattress on top. So not very comfortable. All in all the hotel was NOT clean and I would not go back there.
5,593,"Oct 5 2009 	excellent hotel	We have just returned from this hotel after spending one night here. The staff were really helpful, polite, couldnt fault them. The hotel itself was spotless. We asked for a quiet, non smoking room and that was exactly what we got. Room was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was buffet style and had everything inc full english, croissants, every kind of fruit juice and endless tea and coffee. Would definately stay here again, excellent, excellent."
6,593,"Sep 16 2009	You get what you pay for	The room was average, the food was ok. But the location was only the best thing about it."
7,593,"Sep 10 2009 	great value hotel.	stayed with 3 friends recently and would like to say how suprised i was. having read other reviews (mostly negative) heres mine:room: yes the decor is tired and dated but clean (daily) spacious and adequate.food: full english, plenty of it, not gormet but o.k. a la carte dinner available, 3 courses, eat as much as you like, 9.99p bargain!bar: happy hour 12.00-19.00 (most welcome) prices reasonable.staff: helpful, hard working and polite.location: within walking distance to many areas including camden markets, roundhouse theatre, regents park and many shops, bars and restaurants with a cosmopolitan feel.2 stops on the northern line from euston, ideal.overall: a very reasonablly priced hotel, everything you need for a short stay in london and with a bit more effort on the presentation and maybe a decor refurbishment this could be a top notch hotel. would i stay here again, yes. would i recommend this hotel, yes."
8,593,"Sep 7 2009 	do not in any circumstances stay here - NIGHTMARE!!	We booked this hotel because of the proximity to Camden Roundhouse as we went to a gig and wanted to be able to stroll in after a few drinks etc. We were given a room with no window - not even a fake one. It is a very strange experience waking up with no outside light, not one that I am eager to try again. The receptionist was rude and unhelpful. Worst of all, they have charged me twice for my stay of 1 night, they are now refusing to accept that they have charged twice - even when I have emailed them a copy of my bank statement detailing the second transaction. Arguments are ongoingStay here, if your not fussed about such things as natural light, customer service, cleanliness, oh - and theft! I have no idea how this hotel is rated as three stars. I've stayed in nicer hostels. Fact."
9,593,"Sep 4 2009	this hotel is bad	I have been a guest of the Hampstead Britannia between the 28th of August and the 02nd of September 2009 and I can say that the only good thing about this hotel is the position: close to Primrose Hill/Regent's Park, 20 mins walk from Camden, 10 mins walk from Swiss Cottage and the Hampstead Theathre......all the rest is bad!The hotel needs an urgent refurbishment, the carpets are filthy and the rooms are poorly equiped. I was in room 513 and this didn't have not even a drawer therefore we had to leave our clothes on a table. The curtains were dusty and full of holes.One of the two elevators was out of order and we had to use the stairs as the hotel was busy and the wait would have been 10 minutes.The room service was bad (perhaps they were short in staff) and our room was only partially serviced (no hoovering, no bed make up).The rates are reasonable but I would only go back once a major refurbishment has been done."
10,593,"Sep 2 2009 	GOOD VALUE FAIRLY CENTRAL HOTEL WOULD RECOMMEND FOR WEST END	Good value for money, this hotel is close to several tube stations and only a few stops from the West End. We had a basement room which did smell a bit damp and had no windows but was otherwise ok. Was some cleaning noise going on fairly early on a Sunday morning at around 8am, but would not put me off staying again! Continental breakfast was quoted in the price, but turned out to be full English plus all the usual buffet fare, so highly recommended!"
11,593,"Sep 1 2009 	A Mediocre experience - this review sums everything up.	Well, a few friends and I stayed at this hotel for a night on our trip to london. When we arrived, we were greeted nicely by a lady who insisted we called her &quot;granny&quot; because her name was grenola or something similar. The rooms are quite compact, though plentiful. The TV was good; nothing wrong with that but the rooms were quite dated and the lack of a balcony to open a wide window or two made the room stifling hot in march! The showers were good, as was the bathroom though a little compact. There seemed to be no kettle in our room, even though there was teabags and sugar. The carpet was a bit dated. The night we came a bulb blew near the door and an electrician was up within half an hour to fix it promptly which was good.The hotel itself has mixed parts. The dining room was a bit of an anti-climax as you would have expected to be waiting on, but there was a quite a small buffet. We did not sample the cooked breakfasts but the continental breakfasts were acceptable. We did not stay for lunch or dinner as we ate out in london but it didn't look promising. The bar was good, though a little aged and the foyer was done up nicely.In the past reviews, many have commented about the neighbourhood. It is quite pleasant and very close to it there are lovely millionaires houses which are quite sweet when we took a walk. It is in a triangle of three tube stations, however it is a little out of the distance for a short walk so take a taxi! The neighbourhood itself has some nice shops and in the local park you can see the BT tower in the distance. It is fairly quiet and in some parts - reserved. There are some lovely buildings there.Overall, a mixed experience."
12,593,"Aug 15 2009 	Hotel ok -but expected better.	Checked this hotel out on Trip Advisor and reviews were quite good. My experience however was that the room was very, very small. Decent sized bathroom, very squashy bed. No window or air conditioning - room was in the basement or lower ground floor. I had a 'pay for one night get one night free' offer so maybe that was why! Room and bathroom were clean. Lucky enought to get a car parking space but very small/tight car park with loads of building work going on. Some of the decor dated but appears to be refurb ongoing. Breakfast ok and loads of staff who spent all their time clearing up. If some of them waited on guests with tea and coffee I felt the system would have worked better. Hotel in good location for a visit to London - short walk from Primrose Hill which gives great panoramic view of London. Chalk Farm Tube 10 mins. walk. Hampstead Village 1.5 miles away. Easy to walk to Regents Park and London Zoo. If you plan to stay here ask for a room on one of the other floors - not lower ground - and it might be better. Also make sure you are not in the next room to a yob who couldn't talk quietly if he tried. Woke me and everyone else up at 6am when he rolled in after a night out. Had a 30 minute row with his girlfriend. I called the Night Porter who asked him to be quiet as some people were still trying to get some sleep. Row continued although maybe a little quieter. I decided to get up anyway! When I dame back from breakfast he was 'talking' on the phone to a deaf friend in Australia. Hope he is not next to you when you stay here!"
13,593,"Jul 26 2009 	good location excellent value	This hotel is perfectly located if you want to explore north London on foot. The hotel is within walking distance of Hamstead Heath and there are plenty of nice gastro pubs and cafes around. If you want to go into central London, there is a bus stop outside the hotel or the tube station is 5 mins walk.The hotel is not modern but it is clean enough and the service is very efficient. We didn't eat at the hotel, so can't comment on the food."
14,593,"Jul 16 2009 	The best hotel in London	Absolutely splendid, good value, near to Primrose Hill, what more could you want. The manager here is definitely doing something right, food was great, bar was great, room service was sublime.Thank you for an excellent holiday!"
15,593,"Jul 9 2009 	Lovely location - nasty hotel	My company put me up here for a few nights in June, and I was not too happy about it!The location is great. Lovely wealthy area and lots of nice restaurants and a few shops nearby. Within Zone 1 and a choice of 2 tube stations with only a few stops to get into Central London. Free car parking is very good - however, you need to get to the hotel before 5 to secure a space or you'll need to find a space on the road which is pay &amp; display until about 6pm. The car parking spaces are also very small and awkward to fit in.The hotel itself is pretty nasty. Very dated and not particularly clean. The bedrooms have floral walls, floral carpet, floral curtains and dark wood furniture so they feel very chintzy and claustrophobic and smell a bit fusty and you can hear very clearly what's going on in the next rooms. It needs a good refurb. Had a problem with the bed in the room and the night staff were very rude and un-helpful.Breakfast was pretty awful - I'd recommend going to one of the nice cafe's up the road instead. The tea and coffee (if you can call it that) in the jugs was awful, and the cooked breakfast looked like it had been out under the lights for hours.Overall - if you just want a cheap bed for the night and don't plan to spend much time there, then ok, but I would not recommend for a leisure stay."
16,593,"Jul 6 2009 	Clean reasonably comfortable old fashioned hotel	This hotel looks not too bad from the outside. Spinning door impossible to get case through and a badly manned reception. Quick check-in once staff arrived however and small climb to room on second floor. Halls very dark and old fashioned yet clean.Room was clean and quite comfortable with a surprisingly nice bathroom. Beds had no headboard however and cups for tea were dirtyBreakfast good yet staff very impatient and badly organisedWould look elsewhere before staying again, average experiance"
