30,255,Sep 15 2008 	Best Hotel EVER!	We live in Chicago and when we need a little pampering and to just get away..we head to the Peninsula. It is truly an amazing experience and worth every penny.The rooms are so comfortable and the contemporary design is clean and calming.The staff goes above and beyond every step of the way. Its smack dab in the middle of all the action in the city so you are close to everything.You cannot go wrong here...book your stay today!
31,255,"Aug 18 2008 	Close but no cigar at the Peninsula Chicago	I stayed here for a week while in town visiting family and friends. I've stayed at 5 of the 8 Peninsula locations and although this is certainly one of the more luxurious properties they have, the service lags behind the other locations.Now by no means is the service &quot;bad;&quot; just not up to par with it's sister hotels. At the other Peninsula locations, I would consider the service (relative to other hotels, not just the Peninsula Chicago) above and beyond; over-the-top; and sublime. At the Peninsula Chicago, I would consider the service as above average.For instance, at other Peninsula locations, they welcome you with a welcome drink in the room and possibly a light snack. No such greeting at the Chicago Peninsula.At other Peninsula locations, when the Spa was booked, the receptionist offered to either call me if there were any cancellations and even recommended some local Spas - not at the Peninsula Chicago.The rooms are great, the location couldn't be better and the restaurants are top-notch. My friends that live in the neighborhood all love The Bar at the Peninsula as well as the Chocolate Bar they have every Friday and Saturday.It's a wonderful hotel... the service just isn't over-the-top as I've come to expect having stayed at most of their other properties.The hotel accommodations are important but not as much as customer service. At the 5-star level one expects a high level of customer service. The Peninsula Chicago's customer service is attentive at best, mildly impersonal at worst.The Park Hyatt next door isn't quite as luxurious (a little too contemporary for my taste) however their service was surprisingly helpful. If location and a high level of customer service is all you desire, you may want to look into the Park Hyatt Chicago; for shorter trips, I know I will."
32,255,"Aug 10 2008 	Excellent	Fabulous. We stayed with our two toddlers at the last minute for one night due to an airline mishap. Our son has severe food allergies and they were very accommodating of his needs. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the rooms are delightful, and the bed is exceedingly comfortable. Expensive, but definitely an example of 'you get what you pay for.'"
33,255,"Aug 8 2008 	Best Hotel Experience Ever!	We had a great time staying at this hotel. From the concierge service to the Laundry service to management, everybody is just so kind and wonderful. Everything was perfectly timely and arranged in detailed to please the customers. The Hotel has an excelent Buffet that serves breakfast and lunch. What a variety of delicious food! Love it! We had a problem with our Limo service which had a miss-schedule out pick up time and the hotel manager called the company and had limo picked us up in 25 minutes. Just in time so we did not missed the fly back home.We would move to live at the Peninsula if we could afford it all year round!"
34,255,"Aug 6 2008 	Stay in Style	Stayed on a corporate rate for business. I was impressed with everything the hotel had to offer, especially the pool. The crowd was a little old for my tast - looked like a lot of bankers. I did enjoy watching the working girls pick up on them in the lobby bar."
35,255,"Aug 1 2008	Not as good as the first one but still luxorious...	What a great place. I have been to the Peninsula in Hong Kong and while it is not as nice, it still is grand for Chicago. A great location on North Michigan Avenue and the rooms are brand new and spacious. The pool is gorgeous and the afternoon tea in the lobby is quite good as well."
36,255,"Jun 22 2008	A very good choice	I wanted to stay in what I hoped was the best hotel in town and so my expectations were high.The Peninsula did not disappoint.My room was a kingsize deluxe and although it overlooked another building on a side street it was very quiet (unless you open the windows) and well appointed. The staff were all very helpful, efficient and courteous. The spa is very well designed with a nice indoor pool. The outdoor sundeck enabled some sunbathing and room service could be ordered there.The massages in the spa were good but the standard varied.I had three different therapists and one was considerably better than the other two.For 155 dollars for sixty minutes I would have liked more consistency. The location of the hotel is excellent...right by Michigan Avenue. I would recommend Peirrot Gourmet for breakfast which is quite casual. It is part of the hotel so you can charge to your bill but is accessed from the street by the hotel so is very close by but gives the feeling of being out of the hotel."
37,255,"Jun 21 2008 	Great 	We stayed here for a long weekend in June, and had a great time. The accommodations are first class, the location is stellar, and the staff is top-notch. You get exactly what you pay for. Our room was very large, the beds were very comfy, and the location is right off of Michigan Ave., so everything we did was walking distance away. We even caught the train to Wrigley &amp; the airport, so I think we only took one cab -- which was to the hotel."
38,255,"Jun 12 2008 	Nice but a little dated and problems with the electrical systems	I have heard great things about this hotel, so I was a little disappointed with conditions on my stay. We were in Room 1523, an executive suite. Here are the pros: Location is excellent--you can't beat it. Right off of Mag Mile. Service is excellent. Friendly staff, we got an upgrade when we checked in. Courteous prompt attention the whole time. When we checked in, we had a little fruit/nut plate waiting for us, and they brought us welcome green tea within 1/2 hour of check-in. That was a nice touch. Suite size was great. Laid out well, lots of room, and it had my favorite thing--a bathtub with a giant window above it. They gave us a late check out of 3pm, which was awesome. Here are the cons: The decor is a little dated and worn. The carpet in our room had what at first looked like a huge water stain running down the hall, upon closer inspection was a tread path from overuse. The very complicated lighting system did not work. There are panels all over the room to control lights and other systems, and they malfunctioned the whole time. Which meant that when we tried to go to sleep that night, we could NOT TURN THE LIGHTS OFF. We had to call maintenance. To their credit, they sent someone up right away to reset. However, the problem continued throughout the night with the lights going on and off as we were sleeping. Yeah, REALLY annoying. Luckily I had a couple cocktails (hey, it was Bluesfest), so I was able to go back to sleep each time. We told the staff when we were checking out about the problem. They were nice enough, and told us that they were in the middle of a &quot;green update&quot; (right, right) that was causing the problems. I just feel like for $700 a night, the lights should work in the room, no?"
39,255,"Jun 8 2008	A++ Hotel	The Peninsula is everything a 5 star hotel should be. The staff is professional, poised and very helpful. The rooms are well appointed, the counsel next to the bed is unique and fabulous. We finally found a hotel bed that's MORE comfortable than ours at home (not an easy task).The spa is beautiful. Although we didn't have treatments, we enjoyed the facilies (workout room, steam room, pool, hot tub, outdoor patio). The spa had very thoughtful touches throughout - e.g. swim diapers for kids, various flavored water and tea, plush towels - all terrific.Avenues (one of the three restaurants). Oh my. Fantastic food, unbelievably creative, delicious. The service was terrific. HOWEVER, the portions are pathetic. For $375 (for two), we should not leave hungry. The waitress explains that each course is 2-3 bites. So, the four course is 12 bites for $75. And, she was right. The 8 course is $115. One should not have to select the 15 course to fill their stomach. I understand that the new chef cut the portions which is a terrible mistake. I would go back in a heartbeat if the portions doubled. We have been to several other top Chicago restaurants (Tru, Trotters, Les Nomades, Everest, Moto), and we have never experienced anything like these miniscule portions.Overall, our experience at the Peninsula was wonderful and I would highly recommend this hotel."
40,255,"Jun 3 2008 	Nice Room except for the Mold	We booked a room, and were upgraded to a suite (rm 1816). However, the suite was located on the 18th floor, right below the pool and locker rooms. During the night, my wife (who suffers from allergies and asthma), woke up with terrible pain in her sinuses. We struggled to sleep for the rest of the night. In the morning, she had a nosebleed.In the morning, we noticed paint &quot;bubbles&quot; on the wall near the ceiling in the living room. When I reached up and touched the bubbles, they were wet and slimy. Upon further inspection, it was clear that there had been a number of &quot;repairs&quot; in the past, but the problem had never been solved.When we complained about this to the management, he acted very honorably. He explained that room was right below the locker rooms in the pool / spa area and there must have been a leak. He comped the room for the night and offered to move us to another room in the hotel.However, the lost night of sleep really wrecked our vacation. We decided that if one room has mold, we couldn't trust any other room and found accommodations elsewhere."
41,255,"May 29 2008 	What 5 Star Should Be	Everything aspect of our stay from start to finish was excellent. The hotel is immaculate, rooms are a nice size, well appointed and quiet. Staff are really helpful and the concierges I worked with were *real* concierges: they were happy to answer questions, make bookings and their advice on Chicago was very good. Front desk staff was helpful, honest and friendly. Gym is beautifully equipped with plenty of machines and an excellent class/stretching room, all with big windows. Pool is a full 25 meters with windows right down to the floor, a great place for a swim! Apples and coffee to go at the gym and pool were a very nice touch in the morning.I travel over 50% of the time and a hotel like this stands out for the comprehensive high quality of all services and facilities offered. I'll certainly stay here again when I'm in Chicago."
42,255,"May 23 2008 	The Absolute Standard	This hotel is the standard by which ALL hotels should be judged, not just Chicago, but anywhere. It is first-class in every way, from the doormen, to the bellhop, to the front desk staff, to the housekeeping.The location is perfect for downtown shopping and sightseeing. The rooms are gorgeous. The food was outstanding. I did not visit the spa but heard only great things.Obviously it is expensive, but this is the pinnacle of hotels."
43,255,"Apr 28 2008 	Romance at the Peninsula	Flawless! Nothing more can be said. Service was excellent, the food was awesome and the location is amazing! Situated atop Tiffany's on Michigan (does it get any better?!) its in the middle of everything. The staff is very helpful. Of course it all comes at a pretty penny, but the suite is worth it - with a plasma in the bathtub, press button EVERYTHING, floor to ceiling windows, its exquisite."
44,255,"Apr 26 2008 	Almost perfect	I stayed one night on a business trip. The room was fine; the bathroom exceptional. I love the way a light comes on in the closet when you open the closet door. The staff was friendly and repeatedly offered to help. I have two relatively minor quibbles: I had to search the room for a water glass to brush my teeth. I finally found one in the bedroom with the water bottle. A slip up by the staff? Secondly, I like to have a cup of coffee in the morning without ordering it through room service. There was no coffee maker in the room. (I noted when checking out, though, that coffee urns and paper cups were in the lobby. )"
45,255,"Apr 19 2008 	great hotel best in chicago	I stayed 2 nights in the Peninsula and had again a great peninsula experience. Last time in stayed in Four seasons and the Peninsula just has that little bit extra. Chocolates in your room, great breakfast, friendly staff and a very classy lobby. I had dinner in their gourmet restaurant the second night. 200 us for a single couvert including wine and digestive. Not cheap but the best culinair experience I had so far in the US. They have a new chef so check it out. Especially the wagyu with cocos is heavenly. Peninsula, done manila and chicago, cant wait to experience the other seven"
46,255,"Apr 1 2008 	I'd Give It Six Stars If I Could	This was one of the best hotel stays of my life, from start to finish--maybe THE best urban hotel experience. Every need was anticipated and there was a thoughtful touch at every turn. I spent Easter weekend in Chicago and stayed at both the Four Seasons and the Peninsula, and though the 4S was nice and thoroughly professional, it paled next to the Peninsula.My stay here was starting off well anyway, since I had gotten a special holiday rate of $295/night. That's practically unheard-of for this hotel. Despite the low rate, I was still upgraded to a premium-view room on check-in, with a direct view of the water tower and the Hancock Tower. The rooms are wonderfully plush, with closet and drawer space set in a vestibule outside the bathroom so that there's room for a full sofa even in the standard rooms. Bedding is tops, and though the color scheme is still primarily beige, there are nice colorful touches in the textiles. Of course you've probably read about all the high tech gizmos and how practically everything is controlled by a button [Except, oddly enough, the curtains, which are still pullcord-operated. That and the fact that the hotel really needs to upgrade to flat-screen TVs would be my only small quibbles.] The bathrooms are glorious, with deep soaking tubs, easy-to-operate fixtures with great temperature control, and the TV/radio operated from a tubside control. I was checked in by a professional, warm staffer who handed me confirmed restaurant reservations--even though I had booked them through OpenTable; there must be some sort of name cross-checking. I then got a personal tour of the room including its electronics.The Lobby is a huge, beautiful space with tall columns and an airy feel. It's Art Deco with Asian touches. Lunch service there was flawless; the menu is fairly standard for this sort of place, though they do have purple sweet-potato fries. I also went back for the weekend evening chocolate fantasy. At $33, it's a bit of indulgence since you can really only eat so much chocolate late at night without making yourself sick. However, it's a nifty signature offering and just the selection of offerings is fun; plus, they were all tasty. Just off the bright lobby is the bar, which is a totally different environment--dark and moody, with sofa seating as well as the bar itself. Again, attentive service and nice selection. I also had dinner at Shanghai Terrace where I was again pampered beyond belief and found the food delicious. I was there at opening, so had the place almost to myself for a while. It's not cheap, but $115 per person including appetizer, soup course [lobster, mmm], entree, dessert, two cocktails, and tip certainly isn't outrageous. The top-floor pool here is a nice amenity. Always plenty of seating, and the floor-to-ceiling views over the neighboring buildings certainly make it an unusual setting and experience. Just know that there are usually children there and with the hard surfaces, it's not a quiet and relaxing place. The spa certainly is, though. In short, if you can handle the cost for when you're staying, you can't do any better in Chicago. The hotel sits dead-center of the Miracle Mile, and the Chicago subway stop is about a 3-minute walk away. It's less than ten minutes to the theatre district door-to-door."
47,255,"Mar 27 2008	Good not great...	We stayed for 2 nights last month in a deluxe double room. Overall, I'd have to rate the hotel as just ok, and not on the same level as the other Peninsula hotels we've visited.Our check in experience was inexcusable for a hotel of this reputation and star rating. A week before our arrival the hotel contacted me regarding our arrival time (1pm), number in our family, names, ages, etc... When we arrived the woman that checked us in was less than friendly (much less) and informed us that our room wasn't ready. She also asked how many people would be staying in the room, eventhough I clarified that before our arrival. I asked if it would be possible to pay for an upgraded room that was currently available, but she waved me off saying &quot;no, nothing's available&quot; and that she'll call my cell when the room is ready. (By the way, I knew for a fact that the hotel had a very low occupancy at the time and that rooms of all categories were indeed available.) She didn't bother to even estimate when the room would be ready, or direct us to a place to wait. We, myself and 2 children, then wandered the hotel looking for an open restaurant (it was 4 degrees outside and I didn't feel like bundling the kids back up and walking around). It was a Sunday and there was literally ONE place serving in the hotel, which was the lobby lounge. We asked the hosted to be seated at one of the empty tables, but she insisted that they were reserved and nothing would be available for half an hour. I then asked if there were ANYPLACE in the hotel where we could wait and the hostess rudely pointed to her left and said &quot;maybe over there&quot;. After over an hour of waiting &quot;over there&quot;, I finally gave up on being seated in the lobby and approached the front desk again. It was a different agent, this time a very friendly gentleman, and I asked the status of our room. He responded that our room was indeed, and had been, ready for some time and apologized that I had not be notified....This wasted hour and a half was certainly not a huge deal, but also certainly not something that should have happened at The Peninsula. The room was fine, if a bit outdated, and clean. With the exception of the bathrooms, there was nothing exceptional about the space. The carpet was in need of replacement, and I'd cetainly hesitate to pay the rack rate of $600 a night!The majority of our stay was without incident, and I encountered many employees that were extremely curtious and helpful. However, I do believe that our next stay in Chicago will be at either the Ritz or Four Seasons."
48,255,"Mar 25 2008	Still great but needs an update	I have now stayed at the Peninsula Chicago 6 times since the year 2002. I stay here for many reasons, including location, exceptional service and spa/workout facilities. The staff is incredibily courteous. The bathrooms are spectacular with separate garden tubs and showers along with marble accents. The TV above the bathtub is the bomb! The workout area and swimming pool sits on the 20th floor overlooking Michigan avenue and is spectacular. While the Peninsula has never failed in the area of exceptional service, I now feel that this hotel is overdue for an upgrade. Considering the fact that the cheapest rooms run over $500/night there are some areas that need attention. First of all, the carpeting in the rooms is in dire need of replacing. I have stayed in 3 different levels of rooms over the past six years and they all seem to have the original carpeting. My latest stay was no different and the carpeting in the room had some stains and showed a lot of wear and tear. Secondly, they need to upgrade to flat screen televisions. The current TV&quot;s are housed in an armoire that is to the side of the bed and provides for awkward viewing. While the overall room decor is very nice, it is starting to look a little dated. While I will continue to stay at the Peninsula, I believe there may be other options in Chicago worth exploring at this price. Once the rooms are upgraded though, I think the Peninsula will again be the best place to stay downtown."
49,255,"Feb 12 2008 	23 hours of perfection	Wow, best hotel I've ever stayed in, bar none. The service is of a caliber that is beyond words. All the reviews pretty much lay out all the details, so no need to repeat all of the wonderful amenities (okay, I will anyway -- molton brown bath products, TV in bathroom, oversized bathtub and separate oversized shower, temp controls, in-wall sound system, amazing bed to name a few). We were there for my 40th birthday and were upgraded to a nicer room (without us asking), and they sent up a bottle of champagne and strawberries w/ fresh whipped cream on the house. They also sent up an additional dessert plate with truffles and raspberries. Best night's sleep of my life on what must have been 2000-thread-count sheets and a perfect-weight duvet. The spa is unbelievable -- the nicest I've ever been to, and I've been to my share of spas. Unlimited supply of towels, sandals, cucumber water, amazing steam room, the best 90 minute massage I've ever had, everything was so clean and beautiful. Tiny snag at breakfast in the hotel restaurant -- we came down at 9:15 after having called down at 8 to ask about breakfast options, and we were met with 1/2 hour wait. But I simply told the concierge that we had to be somewhere at 11 (the massage) and that we needed to be seated now or I wouldn't be able to really eat breakfast without feeling nauseous during the massage and they figured out a way to seat us right away. Had a perfect breakfast, and we watched them as they set up the sunday brunch, and that looked just over the top amazing. I wasn't sorry to miss it though, since I had just had 2 of the most delicious cups of coffee ever, perfectly cooked eggs, and a bowl of really wonderful museli with cream and blackberries. We were granted a late checkout (2pm) with no trouble. I've just never met that level of service in my life. I could go on forever about this place. If I could ever afford it I would stay there every chance I get.Also--we ate at Shanghai Terrace for dinner -- appetizers were outstanding, entrees and dessert were just okay in comparison, but the atmosphere and service were 100% perfect, so I'd recommend it for sure."
50,255,"Feb 11 2008 	An oasis from the cold	Although it would be difficult to find fault with this property, I am a nitpicker, and like to look at both sides of the coin. So, first the positive attributes (which are abundant) ... the hotel is beautifully laid out, the staff is aware of every minute detail, the rooms are exceptional by any standard, the linens are first rate, the bedside panel is delightful, the in room DVD player a nice touch, the bathroom incredible.Within the mammoth bathroom is a large walk-in shower, two sinks, a frosted-glass-enclosed WC and a huge tub. The ONLY two things I could find wrong were the fact that the restaurants are closed on Sunday and Monday - something I don't understand when dealing with a world class hotel, and that the doorman was nowhere in sight when we needed to brave the -1 degree cold and wind to find a taxi to our restaurant. However, a bellman who (to his credit) was not dressed at all for the biting weather came to our aid. I would most certainly stay here again -- if I could afford it!"
51,255,"Dec 30 2007 	Perfection	My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights with our 3 daughters. The room was exceptional - loved the outdoor temperature reading right by the unit door, the wall controls for all the lighting next to the beds, the tv in the bathroom and the sound system. The beds were so cozy, the welcome amenities for the children were delightful and the furnishings in the room lovely.As someone who hates indoor pools, I found this indoor pool in a category all it's own. It was beautiful, the furniture comfy and the wall of windows overlooking Michigan Avenue was unbelievable. We spent hours there and I still didn't want to leave. My husband treated himself to a massage which he was very pleased with. We did eat in the Shanghai Terrace, which was not great with kids. I highly recommend this hotel. The service, decor and pool are impeccable. It is my favorite hotel ever...."
52,255,Dec 30 2007 	Perfection	I stayed in a 1br executive suite. I think this hotel is slightly better than the Chicago Four Seasons. They are both very similar-new hotels located in an office tower. Great location and terrific service. I will come back.
53,255,"Nov 27 2007 	Another World of Luxury!	My wife and I stayed here for my birthday and let me tell you, it truly is a different world of luxury. Upon check in we were upgraded to an Executive Suite (without asking) that had a living room, HUGE bathroom and a king sized bed overlooking the Water Tower. Also had some dried &amp; fresh fruits as well as a box of Vosges Chocolate Truffles waiting in the room for us. Oh, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub with a TV in the wall! While we didn't eat at the hotel (we went to Gibson's), we did grab some pastries &amp; coffee from the French bistro on the 1st floor for breakfast that were perfect. Obscenely expensive, but an experience we'll remember forever. Well worth it!p.s. The shampoo/lotion they provide is from Molton Brown which you should try your hardest to use all of, it's fantastic stuff!"
54,255,"Nov 18 2007 	Great	I honestly have no idea what people here are complaining about. This may be the single nicest domestic hotel in which I've stayed-- and I spend a lot of time in hotels. Check-in was quick and efficient. The room was -- wonderful. It had every convenience I could imagine. Large bathroom with separate tub and shower. Can watch TV or listen to the radio while soaking in the tub!!! In-room stereo. Great lighting. Free, easy wireless internet. Comfy desk/chair and sofa. Can see TV from anywhere in the main room. Terrycloth bathrobe and slippers. Free bottled water in the evening. Really, I can't imagine anything that was left undone or anything more that I'd want.No room noise. Never any wait for elevators. The hotel is within walking distance from many stores and restaurants. They offer you a choice of 4 newspapers -- I asked for 2 and got a third! Concierge was great -- wonderful recommendation for sushi restaurant.I had a minor issue with the mini-bar (which wasn't cold). I called the front desk. Literally within five minutes, I had room service at my door, bringing two of what I'd wanted -- on the house. They replaced the fridge while I was at dinner. Impeccable service.Didn't try the spa -- unfortunately --so no comments on that.The hotel bar was fun -- but they do allow cigar smoking, so beware. You can take drinks up to your room. Room service was timely although the food was only average, especially for the price. Food/drink prices are high for Chicago but, as noted, there are many great places to eat nearby.This is a great hotel with great service. Absolutely recommend it! Can't wait to return to Chicago to stay here again."
55,255,"Nov 15 2007 	Great spa great Shanghai Terrace restaurant	Everything else was booked, so I ended up in the Peninsula. Mostly stayed in the Swissotel before, but P. is definitely much better (and pricier). Got a room upgrade to a huge suite, which was awesome, so I can't say much about the standard room. Room was somehow cold, and heating/AC-system did not seem to respond to my manipulations at the 'command center' (included in bedsite telephone). Knobs at drawers come off, yes, the shower door does not really stay closed, but who cares. Spa is awesome, nice pool, book a massage if you have time. We ate at the truly amazing Shanghai Terrace (inhouse). My guest, who likes to eat very well, was blown away. Upon check-out there was a minor problem with the fact that the breakfast had not yet been charged to the room and the receptionist had to use persuasive language to get this done. And yes, she was rather rude. Does not fit in this hotel.Room was absolutely quiet, which is a nice change from a lot of hotels (Swissotel with the rambling elevators can make sleep impossible).I would not pay the price out of my own pocket, but on someone else's credit card - why not."
56,255,"Nov 8 2007 	The Best!	WOW! Im not sure that there are enough superlatives in my vocabulary to completely describe my experience at The Peninsula. The only downside is that this hotel will possibly ruin you for all lesser offerings.My wife and I moved here for one night after spending two nights across the street at the Ritz-Carlton. The desk staff at the Peninsula was accommodating was able to get us assigned a room at the early time of 10:00 AM even though we were visiting on a very busy weekend. This was a nice surprise to begin our stay. The friendly clerk then walked us to our room, introduced us to the many features of the room, and verified that everything was to our satisfaction. I found the level of service throughout the hotel to be exceptional. Every employee that I came into contact with was polite and helpful.The room was very nice. We had reserved basic room, and found it to be quite comfortable and spacious. The earth toned dcor is elegant without being overwhelming. The bed and linens are just wonderful, and it can be hard to coax yourself out of bed in the morning. The fact that you can control all of the electrical for your room from a bedside panel was a feature that I had never before experienced, and I just loved it.The bathroom was also large and well appointed. A two person soaking tub with a television perched above was on the far wall. Another control panel for the lights, radio, television, and phone are within easy reach. The tubs speakerphone even neutralizes the sound of the water so that a caller does not hear that you are calling from the tub! The bathroom which is all finished in marble and frosted glass also includes a large shower and other necessary facilities. The room also contains a fair sized closet, electronic safe, personal fax machine, DVD Player, and well stocked mini-bar. The 19th and 20 floors are where the pool and spa are located. We found these areas to also be very nice. Most of the common areas were stocked with chilled bottled water, and the lobby had a coffee bar set up in the AM hours. The hotel bar is a warm, inviting place to have a drink. However, it can get quite crowded.If there are any negatives to mention, I would say that the selection of soaps in the room could have been better. Also, parking $$$ will break you if you bring an auto, but I guess that is pretty standard for downtown Chicago.In conclusion, this place is just the best! At least the best I have ever stayed in. the Peninsula has a great location right on North Michigan, a warm, friendly staff, and very comfortable rooms. What else can you ask for?"
57,255,Oct 27 2007 	Loved the hotel	This was my first trip to Chicago and my first stay at a Peninsula hotel. The room and the staff were both great. I plan to stay at other Peninsula hotels in the future.
58,255,"Oct 22 2007 	wonderful	High class hotel, with large rooms and huge bathrooms. Luxurious bathrooms especially. Great rooftop pool."
59,255,"Oct 7 2007 	Very disappointing and not worth the price	My husband and I booked a $795 Executive Suite for a birthday weekend. A person from the hotel called last week to ask our newspaper, drink, fruit, and housekeeping preferences. Nice touch, right? Well, we thought so too until we arrived and the front desk asked us the questions again. Unfortunately none of our preferences were acknowledged at any time during our stay. Why ask if you're not going to attempt them?We checked in at the front desk, and were truly taken aback by the rudest, most short tempered front desk person we have ever encountered. It really surprised us how someone like this could be checking in guests at such a nice hotel. It made such a poor first impression. My husband - whose ears were still stuffy from the plane - asked twice on what floor was the fitness center located. The second time she answered, she huffed and snapped at my husband. It was a very unsettling experience.Our suite was okay, but not great. The furniture was very scratched up. The outdated TVs had very poor pictures. The phones were also very outdated, and one did not work. We had to call for housekeeping 4 times on Saturday. We received half a newspaper on Sunday (they are placed inside a locked box so we knew it was delivered that way!) The suite did not meaure up to its price, hype or reputation.We thought the location was good - but saw many other luxury hotels in the same location. The bed was comfy, and room service was good. We will not stay at The Peninsula when we visit Chicago in the future. We strongly suggest you stay somewhere else."
60,255,"Sep 30 2007 	Good...but not great	I recently stayed two nights at an Executive Suite at the Peninsula. I almost always like to stay at Four Seasons properties when I travel, I had never been to Chicago, and so I was really torn, but based on the reviews here, and wanting to try something new, I chose the Peninsula. Arrival went smoothly. Our rental car was met promptly and courteously and the bellhop was quick and very pleasant. Check-in was fine, although the reception was a bit chilly, not the welcoming Four Seasons experience I am accustomed to. In addition, the entire lobby which includes a very large and lovely lobby bar as well as a separate room containing a darker, more traditional bar, reeked of cigar/cigarette smoke. This was not a promising start. I too, went in with pretty high expectations of the room. For $795 a night, I expect something pretty special. But the first impression of the room, an executive suite with three-way directional views, left me flat. It was fine, but there was no 'wow' factor. The wall-mounted flat screen TV in the living room was nice, the TV at the foot of the bathtub is cool, sorta, but I wasn't overwhelmed. The drapes were not automated, which was annoying. The room was cold, and when I went to turn on the heat, I found baseboard heaters which did not work in the bedroom and in the living room reeked of something burning. We called down to the front desk and asked for the problem to be fixed while we went out to dinner (at Topolobampo, which was FABULOUS).When we returned, we did not know if a technician had been to the room. The burning smell was gone, but the heaters in the bedroom (which is separated from the living room by a long hallway and the bathroom) were still not working. I called down to the front and a technician came up promptly and explained that he had thought he had fixed the problem. He puttered around then left again saying he would try something else. He never returned and the heaters never worked in the bedroom for the duration of our stay. The small service missteps continued. I had asked for daily delivery of the Trib, but got the NY Times both days. I couldn't get the TV in the living room to work and felt like an idiot, but then even the technician couldn't get it to work, and that required some work before it was operational. Room service for breakfast was prompt, but the coffee and pastries weren't very good. We ventured into the bar briefly, but the incredibly stiffling smoke drove us out. I dreaded walking through the lobby because the smell prevades the entire floor. For a hotel of this caliber, this is really unacceptable. The second night we took advantage of the house car, a lovely black Lexus with driver provided free to guests, when available, to go within a 2 mile radius. It was a nice change from the rather harrowing cab ride experiences. Our room came with the acclaimed Hastings bed, which was indeed, fabulous. The towels and bathrobes, while roomy, were not very soft. The amenities in the bathroom were fine and as expected (bath products, hair dryer, dental product, sewing kit, slippers). The room is very quiet and effectively blocks most of the city noise and we never heard anything from other guests or rooms. We had a rather packed schedule and did not get up to the spa/pool area. The hotel itself is located within easy walking distance of the Art Instititue, Millenium Park, and some very nice shopping. If I return to Chicago, I would not return to the Peninsula."
61,255,"Sep 20 2007 	Disappointing	Maybe my expectations were too high but I must say that I was very disappointed in my stay at this hotel. My trip was relative to three days in Chicago on business and was booked by my company. Finding out I was staying at the Peninsula seemed like quite a treat, but I won't be back. The hallways and rooms are looking worn (surprising for a hotel of this caliber) and service was average at best. Also, upon getting to my room it had a very odd smell to it ... I even double-checked to insure I was in a non-smoking room. As I went into the bathroom to unpack, there was a used tissue, used towel, used soap and water all on the bathroom counter. Also, it was obvious that the toilet had been used. All I can come up with is that someone else had checked-in, decided not to deal with the odor and checked out of the room; however, no one took the time to clean it or even double-check what the previous guest possibly had done to the room. When I called the front desk, I was immediately moved to another room but it kind of set the tone for my visit.I have enjoyed stays at other Chicago hotels much more and I know they did not charge what The Peninsula does. While I may be back on business, I would never book this hotel on my own."
62,255,"Aug 28 2007 	Second visit - consistant high quality	This was my second stay at the hotel. This time I came for a get-a-way weekend with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. The location was great and the room was excellent. Check in was quick and flawless. The front desk confirmed all of our dinner reservations booked via concierge (reservations were for both in and outside of the hotel). The hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries for our special occassion. Prior to our arrival my wife ordered Congac and cigars to surprise me. She was a little upset that they were not in the room upon arrival as she had requested and confirmed. The room was very comfortable. The bed was incredible - wxtremely comfortable!!! There was plenty of closet space and a large, well appointed bathroom. The room was service was excellent. Every time we ordered ( a least once a day) we were quoted a time of arrival. They arrived almost to the minute from the time we were quoted (I don't know how they do that unless they are waiting outside our room and knocking right at the quoted time.) Finally, the staff treated us like movie stars. Everyone remembered our names and always asked how our dinner reservations turned out the previous evening. We truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel to couples."
63,255,"Aug 26 2007	Tired room and weak spa.	We had high hopes for our stay but were disappointed. First, we booked a deluxe superior room; the view of an exterior wall of an adjoining building left something to be desired. I turned on the water in the sink and it started filling up with water. I pushed the lever down to open the drain and the entire lever came off in my hand and something metal dropped to the floor. Next my wife took a shower and the shower door would not stay closed. Needless to say, it was surprising to find that things were broken and not working properly in our room.The next morning I went to the spa and BOTH the steam room and the whirlpool were broken. While in the pool area, I spoke with a fellow guest who stated that while using the hair dryer in his room he received a rather large electrical shock. The management offered to take 25% off his bill.On the whole, the Peninsula was a nice hotel but they need to work harder at keeping the mechanical elements working."
64,255,"Aug 8 2007 	Swanky lovely hotel	The women in my family stayed at the Peninsula for three nights in August 2007. We had three rooms adjacent to each other, one with a Bed and Breakfast package. Two of our rooms were ready at check in time, but the third was not ready even an hour later. We found out that a prior guest had smoked in the room and they were trying to air it out. It never did air out over our stay. To the credit of the hotel, they did offer to move us on our second day, but we declined because of the hassle factor. Otherwise, check-in was the low point of our stay. The person that checked me in seemed to not know what to ask me, how to print out the check in card, and never asked me questions about newspaper preferences, food allergies, etc. that the others in my party were asked. The woman who checked in my mother was downright rude, talking down to her in an insulting way. We believe she is the assistant manager, but we aren't sure. This did not start our stay off well, especially when we found out her room was the one that had been smoked in. Actually, the main level with the restaurants, check in, and concierge always reeked of smoke. We wondered if there was a cigar bar in the hotel. A good reason to ban smoking in all public areas of hotels, in our opinion.Other than this worrisome beginning, the rest of the stay was great. We loved the rooms - regal, warm decor, a stupendous bathroom, great a/c during a very hot time, and staff that catered to our many requests prompty and graciously. Softest sheets ever and large, thirsty towels -- heaven!We had a number of treatments in the spa, all great. The facilities were top notch and very clean.We had afternoon tea the day we arrived and it was lovely. However, the breakfast package proved to be a bust. Their breakfast menu is fairly limited and the food was outrageously expensive. I don't mind paying $30+ per person for breakfast, but I want a lot of choices, served promptly. Service was uniformly slow in the Dining Room, although waiting in such a grand space was not the worst thing in the world!It is hard to decide if the experience was worth the price we paid. I have stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Four Seasons, and I found this experience on par, although more pricey. I don't think we would go back to the Peninsula, especially with the opening of a Mandarin Oriental and a Shangri-La property in Chicago in the near future. I think we would try these other properties, especially if their rates are competitive."
65,255,"Jul 9 2007 	Still my favorite hotel in Chicago	I had a very pleasant three night stay at the Peninsula Chicago in late April, 2007. My room was a grand deluxe king, on the top floor of the hotel. This was my third stay  my previous two stays had been in an Executive Suite and a Junior Suite.As with each stay, the check-in was flawless  I was on my way to my room within a couple minutes. The front desk asked if I had dinner plans, and when I told them I was interested in eating at the Shanghai Terrace (one of the on-site restaurants), they called right away and made reservations for me.The room was very comfortable. There was terrific lighting, and the desk was more than suitable for business. The couch in the room was also comfortable, and had excellent lighting for reading. The linens were first rate. Everything in the room was in excellent condition.The bathroom is very similar to the bathrooms in the suites, except that there is only one sink, not two. Otherwise, the separate shower and tub were identical to the ones in the suites. I note that the tub has a built in TV at its foot (with waterproof controls next to the tub)  this feature contributed to my son (on a prior trip) describing the hotel as his favorite of all time.All aspects of the service were at Peninsula levels  superb.I went into this stay with the Peninsula being my favorite hotel in Chicago, and I left the stay with no reason to change my mind. Ill be back."
66,255,"Jul 2 2007 	That's why you choose the Peninsula	Fabulously professional service and elegant rooms. Some of the room electronics and televisions could be updated, but it's even a stretch to find fault with that. Perfect business stay."
67,255,"Jun 25 2007 	Really great. Lots of perks	Great location. Next to water tower which is great for taking the free trolley or the bus. Rooms are very clean, crisp. There is a small crack on top of the bath but who cares? Large rooms with separate corridor for luggage &amp; wardrobe so you are not cramped in like with most hotels. Bathroom has a shower recess with 2 showerheads (one fixed and one portable). Bathtub also has a showerhead. TV in the bathroom. Free slippers, internet (which I am using now to write this review), Molton Brown lotions/shampoos and bottled water which are all very handy. Pet friendly (seen a dog in the lobby). Highly recommended....Did I mention the powder/makeup area in the bathroom as well?"
68,255,"Jun 7 2007 	Afive-star hotel in a great location	Our recent stay at the Peninsula Hotel in Chicago for a business meeting was great with only positive comments! The hotel is actually large, with over 300 rooms, but we never felt anonymous or as one of the masses. The placement of the reception area on the second floor gives it a sense of privacy, and there was always that rarefied and discreet feel throughout --in the elevators, the hallways, in the Lounge restaurant, etc.. Service was excellent all around: attentive, anticipatory, polite, and very accommodating. At check-out, with 2 people ahead of us, an additional staff member promptly appeared to help &quot;move things along&quot;. For what I think was a fairly standard double room, we had a view of the Water Tower; the bed was really, really comfortable; all bed and bath linens were squeaky clean and fluffy; but the star was the brilliantly spacious bathroom with marble-tiled separate shower, a granite vanity, tons of strategically glass doors/partitions, and Molton Brown bath products. We agree with one of the previous reviewers that the room decor is neither designer-trendy nor overly rich, but we ourselves didn't mind the understated and unfussy furnishings after being overly stimulated all day with work-related stuff. We ate at the hotel restaurant Avenues and found the innovative cuisine to be lots of fun (lavender-crusted squabs; heirloom beet salads with citrus segments and lamb's tongue baby greens, etc.) The hotel is on East Superior, between N. Michigan and Rush, with all kinds of interesting galleries, boutiques, and luxury brand shops nearby away from Michigan Ave. and along smaller tree-lined streets. At the same time, it is quite easy to get back to the Loop -- approx. 5 mins. by cabs (and about 5-6 dollars) to get to Orchestra Hall, the Art Institute.We have previously stayed at the InterContinental, which we thought was nice but not on the same level, and at the Fairmont, which was very nice, but the location of the Fairmont was a little more awkward in relations to shops, etc.There is a spa on the top floor, which we didn't have a chance to see or use."
69,255,"Jun 6 2007	rude and unprofessional service at the Spa at the Peninsula	We stay at the best five star hotels all over the world. We really love the Four Seasons for their consistent service. We live in Chicago and travel often. I booked a spa appointment at the Peninsula spa in Chicago although we have stayed more often at the Park Hyatt and love it-- better service and great room up to date rooms.My husband booked my spa appointment as a gift which I was excited about and received an excellent treatment but the spa manager was rude and hung up on me when I asked her a simple question..Her name is Tiffany Craig. I would never book another appointment or stay at the Peninsula Chicago again under the circumstances. If this person represents the Peninsula style, I guess no one I know would be interested in staying at the Peninsula Chicago. My grandfather and myfamily were frequent guests for many years at the Peninsula Hong Kong.Unfortunately, those days are now over."
70,255,"May 10 2007 	""Handicapped room""--Great stay	There are lots of reviews of this hotel, which is why I decided to stay there; but I thought I would review the &quot;handicapped&quot; room we got when we booked a couple of days before and were given almost the last available room in the place. Obviously they like to save it for people in wheelchairs or with disabilities. Perhaps others may like to know what to expect from these rooms at the Peninsula.Because of delays (we landed in a snowstorm), we arrived at the hotel after midnight, but were greeted pleasantly. If I had wanted, someone would have taken our bags up to the room, but I liked that no one insisted. There were no stairs to negotiate in or out of the hotel. The entrance is on the ground floor, but then you take an elevator to the lobby floor.Our room was large and comfortable with room for a wheelchair to go around the beds, through the doorways and into the bathroom. The bathroom was designed for wheelchair use and all the storage, except for the closet, was at wheelchair-accessible levels. On a side note, the Chinese restaurant at the hotel gave me one of the two best Chinese meals I have experienced in my life-- the other was Hakkasan in London a few years ago--, and I am a Chinese-food aficionado. I was not surprised when I made inquiries and found that the chefs in both cases came from great hotels in Singapore, Raffles and the Mandarin Oriental respectively. The Peninsula is perfectly located and I will certainly try to stay there whenever I go back to Chicago."
71,255,May 2 2007 	Expensive dowdy rooms a downer despite service location	Dowdy rooms but very good service. Good location but there are nearby hotels also with excellent service for much less money. I can't get over how the rooms are rather blah compared to other four and five star hotels.
72,255,"Apr 24 2007 	Absolute best ever!	I swear, this is the best hotel in Chicago. Nowhere else will you be treated with such kindness and respect.The attention to detail is superb. My husband and I stayed here over the 4th of July weekend in 2005 and it was awesome.I had breakfast in bed the next morning while my husband went swimming. It was sooooo good.This is definitely worth the price and it is a treat to stay here. They will go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable for you as they can. And they do everything for you. . .We were in awe when they asked us what newspaper we would like in the morning. . .=)"
73,255,"Mar 22 2007 	Well Worth It	My ten-year-old and I recently returned from the Peninsula. When making my reservation the hotel inquired if they should note a special occasion for our trip. I told them we were celebrating a child's birthday.Much fuss was made of this. A Peninsula Bear, gummy bears, chocolate chip cookies, and special bath treats were delivered to our room. My child felt very special for all the attention while the surprises lent a festive air to the day.We enjoyed the pool frequently. The lanes made for perfect lap swim while children enjoyed themselves in another corner of the pool. Coffee, tea, ice water and fresh fruit are there for guests to enjoy.Check-in and check-out were swift. Our room was ready when we arrived before noon. Concierges Gary and Robert went out of their way to help us secure reservations and make recommendations.The property is beautiful. Our Grand Deluxe room was well-designed, while common areas are luxurious and comfortable(just right for the two of us, but would have been crowded for a family of four). Room service comes at a price at any hotel. Here it was speedy with quality food and a lovely table. Like so many things at this hotel, room service was attended to in great detail. It felt like a treat rather than just a convenience. Where else would I be asked if I prefer milk for my coffee to be warmed or served cold?The tariff is dear, no getting around that. I felt that for a special occassion such as ours, the value was there in the grandness of the hotel, the superior service, and the staff who were friendly and helpful. The Peninsula staff is hardworking, but they always appear to be cheerful. It makes for a pleasant atmosphere.Thank you to all Tripadvisors who reviewed this property, for good or not-so-great. These and other Chicago reviews helped me to select a property."
74,255,"Mar 7 2007 	Poor service	It took 45 minutes to check in -- not fun with our two children. Then they told us that the room we booked was not available. We had written confirmation of our reservation, and showed it to them. First they said it was a computer error, then they changed the story to something else. They said that in any event they didn't have any rooms available except a small single room with one king bed -- certainly not sufficient for the 4 of us! We spoke with the manager, and then that person's manager, and they wouldn't do anything except see if they could squeeze in a cot in the small room, admitting that at best it would be a tight fit. I explained that I've stayed at many nice hotels, and that if this happened at, for example, a Mariott then they would give us an upgrade. He pretended to type something into the computer, and then told me that no upgraded rooms were available. I then had a friend call and reserve a small suite for the same night. Lo and behold, my friend was able to get us into the suite that he paid for. Unbelievable."
75,255,"Feb 10 2007 	A very nice stay at the Peninsula	We stayed at the Peninsula Chicago in January for a weekend with our 2.5 year old daughter. We were booked into the lowest ranking room, a superior with a king sized bed. Although there wasn't much of a view (we looked onto another highrise), the room itself was wonderful.The decor/furnishings were unblemished and that bathtub was pretty neat with the TV. The only weird thing: the toilet is enclosed by frosted glass walls within the bathroom. Not a big deal, but as our little girl gets older, that could easily become an annoying privacy issue.Speaking of kiddie stuff, the crib that they supplied was adorable - linens for a little girl, bath supplies, a stuffed peninsula bear. Very cute - she loved it. The downstairs restaurant supplied me with complimentary milk each evening to take back to the room for her.The manager also arranged for a complimentary bottle of champagne and a trio of chocolate desserts upon arrival into our room - aside from attending a family wedding, we were celebrating my husband's birthday and they certainly made a nice effort towards making it special.The indoor pool/spa is nice -although a bit chilly! We didn't have spa appointments, but the public area of the spa has been newly redecorated and looked great.Other things to note: this is downtown Chicago, so if you are renting a car, be prepared to pay for parking. I think it was just over $40 at the Peninsula for valet, per night. Drive-in and drive-out priviledges included. Also, there is a chocolate buffet each evening on the weekends - make sure to get reservations if you're interested in going.Overall, we loved the Peninsula and wouldn't hesistate in returning."
76,255,Jan 22 2007 	Exceeded expectations	We stayed for my birthday last weekend. The room special included lunch/tea in the atrium. It was such a nice way to start the day off right. My husband mentioned that it was my birthday and the manager arranged to send up a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of beautiful birthday chocolates. The staff could not have been more accomodating. The only advice I would give would be to make sure you get a room with a bath tub. It is very luxurious and there is a television right above it. The decorations are very tasteful and elegant. I want to make this an annual adventure.
77,255,"Jan 1 2007 	Good but not a top ten in America...	We are both in our 30's and have stayed in very nice resorts both internationally and domestic (four seasons, etc)My honest opinion being a native to Chicago is the hotel is of course beautiful but overall just OK.This hotel is a &quot;top ten&quot; in every list, but no WOW factor at all.The room is very nice and good bathroom (not much better than a deluxe hyatt)The tea service was 'OK&quot; You expect perfect service, food, attention and overall it was nothing better than a decent lunch.The peninsula bar is a great place to enjoy a scotch, cigar, champagne !We once had our privacy please on and were in the shower when housekeeping came in. I called down and asked why they did not look at the sign. They really had no response. Half the time you call concierge they forward you on somewhere else.At four seasons you can ask any staff member for something and he will personally call the right people and call you back.Nothing wrong with this place, but 600-800 a night let's get something clear - it might not be worth it.The pool (3rd time there in 3 years) is not beatiful and again no wow factor. Small hot tub and the spa renovation makes no sense."
78,255,"Dec 28 2006 	Not worth it	Overall our stay was just okay. The room we reserved was not available so they offered an upgrade but honestly the upgraded room (small suite) was cramped and was definitely not as open as our double deluxe room would've been. I thought the bathroom was nice but that alone was not worth the $400+ room rate. I did have a couple of issues, the main issue being that the breakfast we ordered via room service was terrible. I actually had to send it back because the eggs were completely overcooked, the ham was rubbery from sitting in the warmer too long and the english muffin was completely cold and untoasted. Overall we were disappointed and have had much better experiences at 5 star hotels like The Ritz and 4 stars like Westin hotels."
79,255,"Nov 15 2006 	Excellent	Stayed in a Juior Suite with my three kids in early November, four day weekend. Beautiful suite, if a bit small for four people. The much praised bathroom was a hit with the kids (they spent most of the first hour watching TV in the tub), but I found it a little cramped and the slight lack of privacy for the toilet was a bit of a pain for the four of us.Kids liked the high tech room, but I couldnt get the thermostat to keep the room cool enough without being too cold. The bed was very comfortable. Wireless internet, unlike, I think, the Ritz.Location just off Michigan Avenue was nice, but views were plain. A nice look at the Walgreens/residential tower across the street. A sliver of beach &amp; waves available. Too low to see far, but couldnt watch the street traffic because our room was set back.Excellent service, mostly. On the second night, they hadnt brought our rollaway when we returned around 11:00 and we had to wait almost 45 minutes for it to be setup. Excellent room service, everyone liked their food. Shanghai Terrace was great for lunch. Nice fitness center and pool, though the hot tub was too hot -- another guest agreed. Great free snacks for kids.Price was comparable to a Ritz or Four Seasons suite, though I think perhaps a bit smaller without as nice a view. Overall, I think I slightly prefer the Ritz, but the kids liked the Peninsula better and I wont veto if I get outvoted."
80,255,"Nov 13 2006 	Maximum comfort minimum headache	Spent 3 nights with my family of 6, including 4 children ages 9 to 16, and all I can say is wow. My husband and I are well-traveled New Yorkers and we were impressed with just about every part of the experience. The only hotels that come close in our experience are the Oberoi's we stayed in in India. The Peninsula offered prompt, courteous, professional and highly competent service throughout, in a serene and elegant setting. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.When we arrived we found we'd been upgraded to the Topaz Suite and it was stunning. Quiet, immaculate, tastefully decorated, with a kitchenette, dining area big enough for all of us, lovely bathrooms, etc. There were fresh orchid and other flower arrangements in every room. Complimentary champagne, chocolates and other treats for the kids were very much appreciated. And the rooms had wonderful views of the water tower, lake and Michigan Avenue. The concierge and front desk were extremely helpful. We were allowed a late checkout at 5:30pm, which was great.Room service was excellent, always arriving within 30 minutes, and the food was fantastic. I mean, really really good. We also enjoyed the Chinese restaurant downstairs. Not your ordinary Chinese restaurant, the food seemed more interesting and authentic than the usual fare.The only thing that was even close to a disappointment was the lobby restaurant. The chocolate buffet was probably not worth the cost, unless you take the live music into account, which on the night we were there was an excellent small jazz group with a fantastic vocalist. Might have been better to just have a drink and skip the buffet.At the other end of the spectrum was the Sunday brunch buffet. This was truly outstanding, with more choices of foods, of the highest caliber, than I've ever seen at a Sunday brunch. This was one of the high points of our stay.The kids loved the pool and hot tub. My husband and I fell in love with the fitness center. I'm partial to working out, if not outdoors, then in a room with big windows, and the fitness center really delivered, with excellent machines facing huge windows on the 20th floor. The location of the hotel is great as well. We'd definitely go back, but maybe next time for a romantic weekend by ourselves . . ."
81,255,"Oct 31 2006 	Smooth operators	Stayed at the Peninsula for two nights (Saturday and Sunday) while in Chicago for a wedding (held at the Peninsula). As wedding guests we received a discounted rate for our room and I'm not sure to which room category it belonged. We had two king beds.The Peninsula reminded me of a well-oiled machine, like a luxury car. The place is big enough to feel anonymous but the service is excellent when you need it to be. The check-in staff at the Front Desk disappointed (knew nothing about the wedding, could not tell us about a scheduled bus journey for wedding guests leaving from the hotel, etc) but everyone else from housekeeping to bell staff to the doormen were friendly and efficient. Smooth is the word that kept coming to mind.The decor is bland but restful. My partner found the room control system (varying degrees of light, heat and entertainment at your fingertips by the bedside) to be confusing. If you're not technically inclined, ask the bell person who brings your luggage up to show you how to work the lights. For the rest of us, it's pretty neat. I liked being able to darken the bedroom while keeping the entryway slightly lit for my partner the night I went to bed early. The ambiance lighting worked a treat.Bathroom was fantastic, as per everyone else's review. And ours didn't even have a window, so no view from the bathtub. It was still one of the best hotel bathrooms I've seen -- separate stand up shower from a huge soaking bathtub, towels galore, not just two sinks but two separate vanities complete with toiletries and mirrors. Cue more of that ambiance lighting for a long soak in the tub (I didn't avail myself of the television though).If you're wondering whether or not the Peninsula is &quot;worth&quot; the extra money, I would say it depends on what you value and the purpose of your trip. Some people just want the cheapest place in which to hang their hat, so to speak. Other people care about the concierge's ability to secure tickets and restaurant bookings. Personally, I value comfortable beds, good storage and closet space for hanging up my clothes and intelligent, verging on indulgent, bathrooms. The Peninsula fit my bill for this particular visit at this particular time though I would consider staying there again in the future if I needed to be in downtown Chicago."
82,255,"Oct 15 2006 	Personal service but no wow factor.	Yes, The Peninsula offers a very personal touch to staying at a hotel but we were not &quot;wowed&quot; by our overall experience.After checking in, we arrived in our room and were greeted by mood lighting and soft music, about 30 minutes later, we received a complimentary plate of fruit for our first time staying here.Our Superior King Guestroom was nice and inviting but nothing we haven't had before at other hotels.We did not use the spa, but we did use their workout room. It offers a great view (from the treadmills) looking out towards Lake Michigan or Michigan Avenue and a small assortment of weight machines. Headsets and bottled water are also available. The rooftop lounge area only has enough chairs for about 10 people so get your seat early if you want to soak up the sun.The chocolate buffet on Saturday night offers a large table full of chocolate treats, but we found most of them dry and bland. Hardly worth the $30+ per person.We booked this hotel for a weekend getaway and enjoyed the location, but we will not be returning next year."
83,255,"Oct 1 2006 	Magnificient...	If you have the money to spend on a top notch, 5 star hotel in the loop of Chicago, look no further than the Peninsula. The bellmen in the front were very courteous. The room was excellent -- defiinitely the best we've stayed in.If I have a complaint, it was with the front desk. They fell through on a couple of tasks. Other than those things at the front desk, this hotel is a 10+."
84,255,"Sep 27 2006	My Favorite in Chicago	While the views don't match the Four Seasons or Park Hyatt, the Peninsula rooms are superior, close to flawless and very quiet. No sounds from adjacent rooms and street noise almost completely muffled. The rooms, dressing area and bath are spacious--at least in the Grand Deluxe. Separate shower in bright marble bath. Impeccable service in all regards. Superb location. This was my 3rd or 4th annual stay and i continue to consider this my favorite hotel in Chicago."
85,255,"Sep 13 2006	I will never look at another hotel the same again!	I have to disagree with the previous post about the Peninsula being unfriendly toward African Americans. I took my husband there in August as a birthday surprise and I am still recovering from the extreme pampering and luxury. The staff was very accomodating, and everyone went out of their way to make sure we had an enjoyable stay. My husband and I, who are both African American, checked into the Peninsula at around 1:30 in the afternoon. Not only was our room ready, we were also offered a complimentary room upgrade. The room was unlike anything I had ever experienced. We had tea in the Lobby that afternoon. Everything was delicious and the service was impeccable. We were seated immediately, and the wait staff was attentive. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. As a matter of fact, there was a table with about 10 African American women having tea right next to us. Later that night my husband and I wanted dinner from Grand Lux Cafe, but we were too lazy to walk there. I called the concierge and she sent someone out to pick up our food for us and deliver it to our room. I didn't see or experience any discrimination at all during my stay, and I plan to go back often."
86,255,"Sep 7 2006	outstanding hotel	Stayed here for the first time. The hotel is outstanding. I especially enjoyed the rooftop pool and deck. The deck is a nice way to spend the afternoon reading the paper while looking out at the Sears Tower. The room was nice and although some prior reviews did not like the bed, it was great.....sank into for a sound nights sleep. The public spaces, like the lobby, far surpass the nearby rival Four Seasons."
87,255,"Aug 3 2006 	The ultimate in comfort and elegance	Beautiful and supremely comfortable room (where else can you get a TV at the foot of the bath); a enormous beautiful roof-top pool with an amazing view; and excellent food -- not to mention the extremely attentive service (I would actually prefer if it were slightly less fawing, but that's my taste). I can't even complain about the price (high), because it was certainly justified by the quality. What's not to like?"
88,255,"Jul 24 2006	best in chicago from a new yorker	stayed 2 times before, once in Aug of 05 and in Feb 06 and am booking agian this August, the hotel is first class, food and personal service was perfect, am booked again, i go to Northwestern Medical every 6 months from Southampton, NY and have had nothing but the best experiences, great location."
89,255,"Jul 8 2006 	Back on Top!	The first time we stayed at the Pen in Chicago was in 2004 and the hotel was ranked by T&amp;L magazine as the best in the US. While the hotel was very nice, it did not live up to our expectations. Well, it is two years later and things have changed! We have tried both the Four Seasons and Ritz in Chicago since our last stay and from now on we will stay at the Pen when in Chicago. My main complaint the last time was the bed - it was impossible to get a good nights rest because it was hard as a rock. Well, the Peninsula has rectified that issue - slept like a baby last night in a very comfortable bed. This is truly a five-star hotel - the location is perfect, the rooms are state of the art (very high tech), and the customer service from EVERYONE on the staff was top tier.The Peninsula Chicago has my business forever..."
90,255,"Jun 6 2006	Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful	This place is heaven on earth! The room was divine - I only had a view of the parking lot, but who cares when the carpet is a foot thick and the bathtub is huge! The bed was so comfortable I almost overslept and missed my meeting I was in town on business for. I ordered breakfast in and was perfectly satisfied.I had a few hours before my flight home, so I had a glass of wine in the lobby restaurant. When I needed to run out to make a phone call, my waiter kept watch on my bags near my table while I was gone - that is what I call service! They even had models wearing the latest from YSL walking around the room in case you had a couple thousand dollars to spare. The cost is high, but if you want to know what superior service coupled with ultimate luxury is, stay at this hotel!"
91,255,"May 6 2006	Excellent hotel in great location	Stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for three nights late April/early May. Guy right there at streetside to greet cab and offer to take luggage up. (I decline that...feel guilty having anyone carry my luggage around. Im', relatively young and healthy enough! I go ahead and tip the guy anyway, since they probably peg you a cheapskate, not that that should bother me.) Check-in smooth but awkward and irritating as the clerk tries (through smiling face) to pronounce my not-really-THAT difficult ethnic name over and over. I even say it slowly, and have handed a written pronunciation to the person in similar situations in the past, but it doesn't seem to do any good. I would just as soon not have people calling my name in public where it can be overheard. Paranoid, you say? Perhaps. But I did get burned in a sitaution because of that one time. Something I don't want to go through again while on the road.Then, clerk tries to line up transportaion (limousine) for your return trip to airport, etc... Not really necessary, I say. Asks me what time I'd like turndown service each night, and room make-up each day. I tell him, and that night, when I returned 30 minutes after turndown time, it hadn't been done. Next day, two hours after room make-up time request, it hadn't been done. To me, turndown service is like a lot of things in life -- nice, but hardly necessary. I do like having a room made up though!Had a Junior Suite. Very clean. Separate living room and bedroom, large.long entrance foyer, phones all over the place, including three in bathroom. Bathroom very nice with TV at foot of deep tub, radio console as well, two separte vanities. I was there by myself, so there was plenty of room. I don't mind paying for extra space. Pampering I can do without. For the most part, hotel workers left me alone, which I like. I'm from the &quot;don't call me, I'll call you&quot; school. If I need something, I'll ask. Don't hover and make a lot of fuss on my account.Very quiet, serene, dignified atmosphere permeates throughout the hotel and restaurants. Service and waitstaff at Lobby Restaurant exemplary. Food very expensive, but what do you expect?All kinds of great restaurants and shops around the hotel (Magnificent Mile). Walgreens across the street for sundries at good price. Hotel Gift Shop very small and comes up short in that regard. Also, no ice machines or vending machines on property. Again, something I don't mind doing for myself if given that opportunity. Also, no mouthwash as part of bathroom products. Does have everything else.Pool area and fitness room(s) outstanding. Nice pool and hot tub with great views. Exercise room has many Cybex machines to work all parts of body, plus usual assortment of treadmills, lifecycles, etc...Will definitely stay there again, and am looking forward to it."
92,255,"Apr 24 2006	Worth every penny	My husband and I stayed in this hotel for new years eve and had a wonderful, wonderfl time. The room was beautiful and the service phenomenal. I had a massage at the spa and met my husband afterwards in the pool. The pool facilities are amazing - i wanted to spend an entire day in the locker rooom. They had fluffy towels, a menthol steam room and fancy bath products in the HEALTH CLUB showers. Back at the room we had a huge bathroom with tub and double shower. There were Molton Brown products there as well. The bed was divine and there was a remote control next to it on both sides that controlled the drapes and lights in the entire room. There was a welcome bag with little treats when we got there. The next morning i had breakfast with girlfriends in the little cafe next door which was wonderful, too. One of the best new years eves I have ever had."
93,255,"Mar 26 2006	One of the Best in the US	Spent five wonderful nights at this terrific hotel. It is the staff and service that set this hotel apart from others. First class, professional and friendly.I normally only experience service like this in five star hotels in Asia. The Pen Chicago brings five star service to the U.S. Management is doing something right here. The lobby bar dinner was quite expensive and not too great. Other than that, no complaints. Cannot wait to return to Chicago and stay at the Pen."
94,255,"Feb 15 2006	Elegant with excellent service	My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago over the New Year's weekend. The hotel is elegantly decorated and the service was excellent. I was a little disapointed with the food. We had afternoon tea on New Year's Eve and felt the food could have been a little better. It lacked freshness ever so slightly. Okay, so I'm comparing the food to my tea experience at Claridges in London in October 2005. I would still recommend the hotel."
95,255,"Jan 20 2006	Truly a pleasure	Stayed at the Peninsula for one night in late December, and had an absolutely wonderful experience.From the first contact with the staff to the last, everything was flawless. A request for a high floor, even though I was paying a discount rate? &quot;Certainly sir, how about a room on our 18th (top floor) overlooking Michigan Avenue.&quot; OK! 15 minutes later, housekeeping wants to confirm the age of our daughter to get the appropriate robe and slipper size. An hour later, room service is knocking (or, ringing the doorbell, rather) to deliver a complimentary welcome gift; a tray of fresh chocolate chip cookies, a bottle of coke, gummy bears and jello -- all for the kids. (Rooms without children seemed to be receiving a tray of dried fruits and nuts, which also looked very good). Upon checkout, which took all of about 30 seconds, the clerk was efficient and friendly, while also acting warm and sincere. Physically, the hotel is gorgeous, and impecabbly clean. Our double bedded room was large with a nice seating area, comfortable desk, and a nice little hallway between the bathroom and bedroom. Molton Brown amenities and super-soft towels completed the experience. In the bedroom, bed sheets were soft and luxurious, although I must admit, the bed wasn't as good as some in lower-class properties, although it was still comfortable. The Spa is a must on the upper two levels of the hotel, with great locker rooms, a cool pool, fitness room, and a great selection of teas, coffee, citrus water and fruits in between. The conceirge staff effortlessly handled our questions and gave great recommendations for breakfast. When I called down for directions to a theater, they had it drawn out in minutes. But, thinking back on the experience, it all goes back to the staff, which truly made the trip. Every member of the hotel made an effort to greet us in the hall, and all seemed to care about their jobs, delivering service that was super-professional, but also not snotty. Needless to say, I can't wait to go back."
96,255,"Dec 16 2005	A bit disappointed	The Peninsula was clearly a very nice 5 star hotel. But I was hoping that for the price, it would be the best in town. I have also stayed at the Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt. I think the Park Hyatt is a little more hip, more of a place to take your spouse on a romantic, urban weekend. The Four Seasons is superior in terms of service. I had some difficulty with the concierge at the Peninsula. Nothing major, but despite a request and an assurance of an early check-in, we had to wait a couple of hours to check into our room, which was especially inconvenient since we were traveling with our 2 year old son. Also, there was a mix up with dinner reservations that were not confirmed. I also purchased a special package for our son the &quot;Peninsula Kids&quot; or something. It included a backpack and some goodies for kids. The backpack was so cheap we left it in the room and I would not recommend it. It would be better to just order room service treats for the kiddos. The good news? The hotel was very accomodating to children. The babysitter service was wonderful. And the room service menu was excellent. They had a huge menu for children, which was wonderful. The rest of the food was good, but insanely expensive. I usually don't bat an eye at expensive food, but it was pricey, even by my standards. The bathrooms were awesome, with the flat screen television in the tub. Next time, I will probably stay at the Four Seasons again."
97,255,"Nov 26 2005	Family Trip to Chicago for Thanksgiving	We stayed at this hotel from 21-25 November with our children, ages 4 &amp; 6. Since many of the reviews touch on the beauty of the hotel which is as beautiful as everyone says, I'll gear my review towards those traveling with small children and trying to decide if this hotel is a good fit.1. Location. The Peninsula was perfectly situated for all our excursions to the various museums around town since it's a block from Watertower, the Disney store on Michigan, a couple blocks from Lake Shore Drive and about 2 blocks from the &quot;El&quot; elevated trains/subway. The American Girl store is on the same block around the corner and the Hershey Store and Girardelli were just a few steps more. Plenty of shopping for everyone on Michigan Ave.2. Staff. Everyone was friendly to us and our children. The staff of Avenues was fantastic. Those on the Lobby Restaurant were hit or miss. 3. Restaurants/Food. The Children's Afternoon Tea in the Lobby was yummy with mini hamburgers, PB &amp; J, &amp; ham and cheese in addition to the sweets and a pot of hot chocolate. Pierre Gourmet, the French Cafe just outside the main entrance, was perfect for breakfast (and probably for lunch). The staff and friendly and attentive to us and our children. Room service did well by us when we ordered dessert for the family one evening. Everything arrived on time and was as ordered. The hotel does have a children's menu at the Lobby and Avenues but the selection is somewhat limited.4. Pool. There are three swimming lanes and a hot tub on the 19th floor. There were a few swimmers swimming laps while we were there who were politely tolerant of the 10+ children in the area. While not ideal for children or those who are swimming laps for that matter, it might make a good 30 minute diversion.5. Pen Kids Package. We researched the various packages at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton before picking the Peninsula. The most kid friendly package was at the Ritz Carlton and it provided the most value for the $. If you choose the Peninsula, I would go with the standard room rate or the American Girl package and spend the additional $60+/per night from the Pen Kids Package elsewhere. With the package, the kids got a nice welcome snack, Pen Kids multi-color backpacks, a signature bear (who can't keep it's pants on), crayons and some coloring paper. We also received two coupons (one for ice cream at Bloomingdale's and children's admission to the Children's Museum at Navy Pier). A better investment is to buy a family membership at your local ASTC museum which had reciprocity at a number of museums in Chicago (Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Children's Museum and Field Museum, to name only a few).6. Room. Our bathroom was a nice extension of the main room. Whenever we were there, the kids wanted to take a bath and watch cartoons. This came in handy if one of the kids wanted to nap or as a diversion if one woke up before the other in the morning.7. We also took advantage of the Thanksgiving buffet offered by the hotel. The food came from all three restaurants and exceeded our expectations. The hotel had also created a separate kids area with movies, playstation, and crafts that our kids enjoyed. The only negative were the $18 mimosas we ordered with the meal but thought were included with the buffet.All in all the Peninsula is a wonderful hotel, in a great location. It is clear that the chain is trying to cater to families - the kids room during the buffet was a good example of this."
98,255,"Nov 26 2005 	Great experience in Chicago	When I arrived at the Peninsula after the usual traffic filled ride from O'Hare, I was completedly frazzled and must have shown it. The check in person asked me for my favorite wine and 5 minutes after I reached my beautiful suite, a glass of complimentary wine arrived. What a treat!!! I have stayed at the Peninsula again and the rooms and service are terrific. So are both of the restaurants. I have stayed at the Peninsulas in Hong Kong and Bankok, both of which have better views, but in all other respects the Chicago Peninsula is in their category of among the best hodels in the world."
99,255,"Nov 22 2005	Close (but not quite) perfection	The Peninsula in Chicago is an adventure in extravagance. Our suite was charming; spacious, and with the most extraordinary bathroom I've ever encountered in a hotel, complete with an enormous soaking tub overlooking the Chicago skyline...and a built-in television behind glass, so you could catch the news while indulging in a bubble bath. (It became my habit.) Our bedlinens were crisp and soft at the same time; and control panels for the lights, the radio, the television, and the front door &quot;privacy&quot; light were well-placed throughout the suite, always a finger-touch away. The hotel's public areas are unapologetically grand; amazing vistas, endless ceilings, and gleaming marble floors. Our only complaints? Room service could be a bit time-consuming; it often took forty minutes to an hour (a far longer wait then, say, the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills or the ever-speedy Covent Garden Hotel in London). Once we even placed a simple order (a pot of coffee) and it never arrived. And the valet wasn't too speedy delivering our luggage upon departure; we must have waited fifteen minutes. If the staff can learn the value of alacrity, then this hotel will rapidly become a true favorite of mine."
100,255,"Nov 2 2005	Wow! I can see why this hotel is #1 in the USA!!	After our trip fell thru down to florida b/c my parents still didnt have power from Wilma, the hubby and I decided to take a short trip to chicago. We usually only stay at the Four Seasons, but decided to try the Peninsula based on pics and reviews on here.. and WOW!!! We loved it!From the moment we arrived.. how the head doorman greeted us and they took care of our bags. we got there early at 11am and our room was ready.. we were personally brought to it and given a tour. we then stepped out and got some lunch.. unfortunately their french bistro was booked solid and i didnt want to wait 1 hour.. so, we ate on michigan. upon returning to the hotel they had placed a bottle of champage and choc dipped strawberries and whipped creme out for us!! what a TREAT!! :)i then took a bath in the great tub with the tv.. adn set the mood lighting! so much fun!we had a dinner reservation at Shangai terrace.. and i will agree with the last review.. i wasnt that impressed with the food. to me, it didnt seem to have much taste at all- i got the wok seared lobster and my hubby got the kobi filet.. we also got a bottle of wine and splurged on $20 teas which were amazing. we had a 9pm reservation for the chocolate buffet.. but, we were so exhuasted from the day we decided to pass.. but, i bet it is amazing!!upon waking up sunday morning i called to see if we could get a late checkout... they just told me to &quot;name the time&quot;.. so, we didnt even have to check out until 3pm!!i had booked my hubby for a massage at the spa and myself a facial.. the spa and pool are GREAT! on the 19th and 20th floors of the hotel! great viwes! my hubby loved working out and looking at lake michigan! :)we did have lunch at pierre gourmet then.. it was only a 10 min wait.. EXCELLENT food! i felt like i was back in france! :) tables are very close together and the wait people have to watch out from bumping into one another-- but, itsnt that truly what a french cafe is??one other thing about the hotel-- im an Orchid lover.. and i could not believe the huge, gorgeous orchids they had all around the hotel!! such an oriental, gorgeous look!!!! location as well cannot be beat! right across the street from Saks and Neimanns and within walking distance to all that i love about Michigan Ave! What a great trip! The hotel made all the difference and we will be returning!!"
101,255,"Oct 30 2005 	Only one drawback	The Peninsula is almost perfect. Simply beautiful hotel. We generally stay at the Four Seasons in Chicago and decided to try the Peninsula for a change. Staff is superb, rooms relatively spacious and location can't be beat. Only one negative. If you are seeking a quiet enviroment, the Peninsula may fall short. Our first room faced Michigan Aveneue and even on the 18th floor, the street noise was significant. Also, our room had a connecting door and the sounds from the room next us were annoying enough that I requested a room change. Staff handled the request quickly and professionally. Our new room faced Chicago Ave and was much better. I do understand that if you want to stay in the heart of a major metro area you will have noise. Although I will say that we've not had noise problems at the Four Seasons. And it borders Michigan Ave also.But overall the Peninsula is a real treat. Just as a sidebar, I didn't think the Shanghai Terrace was that good. It's ok but the food had too much msg."
102,255,Oct 13 2005	Superb	Pure luxury ! It would be difficult to find fault with this hotel. The rooms are fantastic - you can't argue with a TV in the bathroom - the staff always anxious to help - and the location for perfect for the Magnificent Mile. If you are able to stay here take the chance!
103,255,Oct 12 2005 	A remarkable hotel...	This hotel is remarkable; every possible need of every guest is met. The staff is perfectly trained; food (even for meetings) was excellent. I will return without fail.
104,255,"Sep 27 2005	Absolutely Wonderful	We went to Chicago for a wedding and chose the Peninsula after struggling through numerous recommedations and reviews on Trip Advisor. I have to say we made an excellent choice; our room (junior suite) was spacious, the beds were comfortable (although not a 'heavenly bed'), the 'at your fingertips' in room gadgets were great as well. The living area was actually very comfortable, which is in contrast to most hotel living areas (e.g. the sofa was soft comfortable, not hard and rigid).My only negative experience was with a gentleman on the concierge staff - on Sunday we wanted a nice brunch spot; he recommended the same places the day before and upon pointing it out to him, he seemed frustrated and asked me to 'then tell me what it is you want' in a less than pleasant tone. I ended up telling him to forget it and walking out. Maybe I am too idealistic, but he should have gone out of his way. I realize they are busy, but this is his job. On the flip side, we encountered many other eager and helpful staff members. I highly recommend this hotel; however, you should book any spa appointments well in advance as they fill up quickly."
105,255,"Sep 25 2005	Best in Chicago by far!	There is no doubt that this is the best hotel in Chicago. We have stayed at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Drake, Whitehall, Hyatt, and others, and none of them have come close to the quality of the Peninsula. The location is perfect, right next to the Water Tower - all the great shopping and restaurants in walking distance, and the &quot;L&quot; two blocks away. The hotel is new (I think it opened in 2002), so all the features and amenities are up to date. The bedside control panels allows one to turn on/off all the lights, control the radio and TV, adjust the thermostat, check the outside temperature, and turn on the do not disturb light outside your room. The beds are as good as the famously wonderful beds at the Four Seasons. The baths are big with double sinks, separate tub (with a TV) and shower, big thick towels, and the toilet is behind a separate door. I just stayed there for my birthday and the hotel gave me a complimentary bottle of French Champagne and a chocolate cake as an arrival gift. The double corner exective suite is spacious and full of light, and at $535/night is less than similar (but not as nice) type rooms at the Four Seasons and Ritz (I think the standard rooms start at around $350). The restaurants are wonderful. Avenues is one of the best restaurants in town, the beautiful lobby restaurant with 2 story wall of windows is great for lunch, tea or cocktails, and the deli/wine bar on the ground floor makes for a great lunch/brunch (we didn't get to the Shanghai Terrace). The service is absolutely wonderful all around. The concierge are friendly, very knowledgable, and helpful. They of course have slippers and robes. The rooms have stereo, DVD player, VCR, fax, and high speed internet access. I noted no negatives (allowing dogs is a major plus in my book); you just can't beat this place!"
106,255,"Aug 27 2005	different take on hotel than other reviewers	Made reservation over the 1-800 number, which I was told came out of Hong Kong, my fault I didn't ask if hotel was pet friendly until we are at hotel dining with pets, and I mean pets everywhere, and my husband is allergic, we asked at front desk if they had rooms that had not had pets in them NO! I LOVE animals but come on you know most sleep with there owners and I myself at the rate of 1300 for the room said no thanks and drove back home to Indy. The bellman said most hotels are on Michigan Avenue."
107,255,"Jul 29 2005	A class apart in Chicago	It lived up to all my expectations of a Peninsula hotel (this being my first one). The decor, restaurants, rooms and bathrooms were top notch - although service was not up to the standards of a Four Seasons. The cigar bar is a trendy spot on a Friday night, the lap pool and outdoor terace gives the feel of an urban resort. All in all made my first trip to Chicago a memorable one!"
108,255,"Jul 20 2005 	Could have been superb	Well - what can you say about one of the elite 35 five star hotels in the country? Besides being EXPENSIVE (Room - minibar-room service), It is a sublime experience - right down to the slippers. Most people that stay here are used to being pampered and the Peninsula does not disaapoint. However - I was very disappointed with the valet service - insomuch to the point of being downright cranky about it. I called down from my room prior to checkout at about 8:30 am and asked for my car to be sent. At 9:15, I was still waiting for it with a 10:00 am flight from Midway (needless to say I missed my flight). The gentleman at the valet podium was very apologetic and trying hard to compensate with extremely charming conversation but I was upset, nonetheless. My car did not arrive until 9:30 - ONE WHOLE HOUR after I called for it. This is very bad. They explained that they were putting air in my tire - which is very nice but it had been there overnight and had plenty of time to do so without jeopardizing my flight. Will I stay at the Peninsula again? Ye, of course. It is one of only two five star hotels in Chicago. The other being the Four Seasons. And even though the Peninsula is more expensive (about $100.00 more per night for a standard room), it is less &quot;snobby&quot; (my opinion), less &quot;put on&quot; with all the amenties and ambience expected for the $600.00 per night plus room rate. The room service menu is good but a little to PanAsian. Could do with a little more versatility, though there are a few &quot;midwestern&quot; options. The bed and linens - excellent - better than home. I slept like a baby. The bathroom is fantastic - way better than the Four Seasons. Just take my advice and make sure they bring you your car on time! I luckily was able to catch another flight 30 minutes later and it didn't really affect my trip - but if I had bee going somewhere else it could have been a real issue."
109,255,"Jul 19 2005	Beautiful Hotel	My husband, 10 year old daughter, and I just returned from a weekend at the Chicago Penninsula Hotel. It was great! The hotel was beautiful and the staff was wonderful! While we were checking in, my daughter was playing with her 2 American Girl dolls. One of the people at check in noticed and sent up 2 little bathrobes and 2 little beds for the dolls without us even asking for it or being told about it! Also, after returning from dinner that night, we were pleasantly surprised to find a note not only welcoming us, but cookies, gummie bears for my daughter, and a fruit tray for us! We loved the hotel also because of all the little details to attention. We tried the chocolate buffet one night as well...which is not to be missed! It was excellent! We stayed in a Grand Deluxe king room. It was a very nice room..the only thing is, it is a little tightly spaced, but not too uncomfortable. I also tried the spa, and it was very nice as well. The exercise room and pool area had a very open feel too it. Overall, it was a great hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
110,255,"Jul 18 2005	Pure Heaven!	We stayed here for two nights-our wedding night and one more. You would have to pry us out of the room because we didn't want to leave! We were pleased to find an upgrade, and waiting for us in the room was champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, and Blackout cake we requested from the Cheesecake Factory (that we were not charged for!). The room itself was stunning and we couldn't believe the door bell, lighting system, and master bath, bigger than our livingroom in our apartment. The concierge was able to make us a dinner reservation (and when we arrived, I overheard them on the phone saying they were booked) and arrange a car to take us home, which ended up being a stretch limousine. Everything about the hotel was classy and wonderful, yet warm and friendly. We are hoping to save up enough to make it back next year!"
111,255,"Jul 14 2005	Excellence	I live in Chicago and stayed at the Peninsula Chicago last year for two nights - the night before my wedding and then with my new husband on our wedding night. We had a suite - living room, bedroom and 1.5 bathrooms. The room is beautiful - decorated in contemporary classic style, with the main bathroom being huge and gorgeous with marble everywhere. There is also a TV built into the wall over the bathtub! Everything is immaculate and very nicely appointed.The service at the hotel is fantastic. In the room, they left us champagne, fruits, nuts, candies and a box of Vosges chocolates. The most wonderful service was at 4:00am, when my husband woke up realizing he had not taken out his contact lenses and had forgotten to pack solution... He called the front desk - they sent someone out to the nearby Walgreen's store and brought back a contact lens case and solution. We did not try the restaurants, but we have been to the bar on other occasions for a drink. It's nice, with a good atmosphere. The drinks are good and they provide little snacks as well.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others. I had such a good experience here that we will be staying in the Peninsula Bangkok during our first-year anniversary trip this year!"
112,255,"Jun 29 2005	Beautiful and welcoming a truly superb hotel	Everything you've heard about this hotel is true. It is simply wonderful and will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago from now on. I've stayed in many hotels around the world and this is easily in the top 5 for service and standards.We ended up stopping here through a twist of fate, it being the start of Memorial Day weekend in the States and our original hotel having overbooked by a mile. Left struggling for room we started phoning every hotel in the city and luckily my third call was to the Peninsula. They had a room and did us a very good rate considering the busy state of the city that weekend. Not that it mattered as the original hotel were picking up the tab but I'm not one to take liberties.When we arrived, rather worn out and bedraggled, the door staff had our bags before we could get out of the cab! We then took the short lift up to the 6th floor check in area and were treated like kings from then on. We were given a deluxe room and boy was it deluxe. Beautiful and huge, really well furnished and decorated with a bathroom bigger than some normal rooms I've stayed in. The staff really went out of their way to give us everything they could, as though they had been at fault for the over-booking at our other hotel!Other facilities are equally great. The gym and spa are excellent, with a wonderful outside seating area on the 20th floor outside the pool which is heaven in the sunshine. The restaurant was as good as I expected, breakfast being particularly superb with the chefs willing to make anything you wanted.In short if you really want to treat yourself and stay somewhere where the excellent staff match the fantastic surroundings then pick the Peninsula. You really won't regret stopping here."
113,255,"Jun 27 2005	The Creme de la Creme of Hotels	Excellent, excellent, excellent from the time we walked in the door until we got into our cab for the airport. The service is impeccable. The computerized lighting system in the room is to die for. It was fun just testing out the different light settings. The bathroom has a TV that is encased in fog-free glass, and the sound is piped in through the ceiling. The Peninsula Chicago is divine!"
114,255,"Jun 22 2005	The best which is no small feat	I have stayed at the Peninsula 5 times. Used to be that the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton (a Four Seasons hotel) were the creme de la creme in Chicago, but then comes the Park Hyatt and the Peninsula and suddenly the FS and RC are almost provincial. Of course, they're not, but the Peninsula has brought an even more sublime sense of hospitality to the Windy City. It is a perfect hotel. The Lobby Restaurant is a high-ceiling space with soaring windows, a wonderful menu, and live cabaret music on weekends. Avenues is haute-haute cuisine, and Shanghai Terrace is the best this side of, well, Shanghai (summer evenings on the terrace are experiences that will have you profoundly appreciate the time and space you are priviledged to occupy). I love the room service, which is quietly efficient and always prompt. The Peninsula is best at meeting individual needs and desires, and strangely faulters when striving to meet group needs; I think their effort to bring their legendary individual attention to groups is mathematically impossible. Can a large group's entrees be tabled simultaneously without compromising quality? Unlikely. But that is my only observed shortcoming. This is, by far, my hotel of choice in Chicago."
115,255,"Jun 16 2005 	Almost....perfect	After reading the Travel &amp; Leisure article giving the Peninsula the #5 ranking in service out of all hotels and resorts in the U.S., I was a little surprised to find, upon arriving on a Sunday at the check-in time of 3:00 p.m., that my room wasn't ready. The young man at the registration desk said he would &quot;put two maids on it&quot; and took down my cell phone number so he could call me as soon as it was ready. I returned 2 1/2 hours later (having received no phone call.) My room still wasn't ready, but after a brief wait, they found another one. The man next to me was complaining that he needed to take a shower and his room wasn't ready. Even more surprising, when the rest of my group arrived at 6:00 p.m., only one of their three rooms was ready. It took an additional hour, until 7:00 p.m., before we all had our rooms.Apparently there was a large convention group leaving that day, and the Peninsula was having trouble getting the rooms made up. (The hotel was full.) Another thing that surprised me was that while we waited we weren't shown a little more love. A small gesture like, &quot;Would you like a free bottle of water or cup of coffee while you wait?&quot; would have helped smooth some ruffled feathers.Speaking of coffee, it irked us a little that at a 5-star hotel one has to pay for something - coffee in the room - that is free at the lowliest Holiday Inn Express. A small carafe of coffee from room service will run about $12 total. However, the Peninsula does give you free bottled water with the evening turndown service. Be sure to use the privacy and make up room buttons. You are locked out while housekeeping is making up the room  I assume for the maids safety and to secure your belongings so you want to make sure they get in there to clean when it is convenient for you. That said, this is a stunningly beautiful hotel with top-notch amenities. The extra items requested from housekeeping arrived in fewer than 10 minutes (this was my second stay.) And how many hotels have a built-in tv above the extra-large marble bathtub - in a standard room? The rooms are so large, comfortable and gorgeous that it's hard to leave them. I have to agree with the other posting, though that the extra-long bathtub is a bit of a challenge for anyone under 5-9. If youre not careful, your feet go up and your head goes down. I was able to hang on by gripping the other end of the tub with my toes and putting a towel under my head. Its kind of hard to get out of, too. But I wanted to watch tv in the tub, so I was motivated. The shower was heavenly. The glass door comes within 3 of the ceiling  enough to vent the shower without fogging up the bathroom. I didnt find the bathroom tight; its about 12 x 12 square, probably the largest standard hotel bathroom Ive been in.I cant imagine what a previous post found to complain about the beds. They are wonderful. It does take a little practice to operate all the light switches, etc., but if you cant find one, just call the front desk and ask them. The spa and pool areas are especially nice. The pool and hot tub are indoors, but there is an outdoor terrace next to them. There are full-blown locker rooms, a large, well-equipped workout room, and free classes in pilates, yoga, etc. Several of the others in our party had massages which they raved about; I had a standard pedicure for $65.The only other issue I had was upon checking out. I was presented with a bill for my stay, which was supposed to have been charged to another person in our party. I was surprised because at check-in they had confirmed that my room was already paid for. However, the clerk checked again, and it was worked out."
116,255,"Jun 12 2005	Beyond our expectations	Several days prior to arriving at the Peninsula I called the concierge to arrange reservations for restaurants and clubs during our stay. Mee Mee at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in pulling it all together. Her recommendations were terrific. She was able to get us tickets to Buddy Guy's blues club even though it was sold out for a special tribute night. The show was amazing. We were celebrating our anniversary and upon arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded from a standard room to a Junior Suite. We we got to the room and there was a champagne bucket and chocalate covered strawberries waiting for us. The Peninsula is the only hotel I have ever stayed at where the person checking you in at the front desk, actually escorts you to your room. The attention to detail in the rooms is apparent. Unlike the previous review our bed was wonderful. The electronic console by the bed allows you to change the temperature, lighting, adjust the music, turn on the privacy at the door, etc.... This is unique to the Peninsula and a real fun feature. The rooms are set up with mood lighting and at the flip of a switch you are in romance heaven. Individual reading lights at the bed allow each person to either be reading or fast asleep. We never ate in the hotel other than the complimentary continental breakfast each morning which if we had to pay it would have been $50/day. Location couldnt be better. If you are looking for over the top views look somewhere else. I am sure that there are rooms with better views than ours but in general this is not a &quot;view&quot; property. Good storage in a room is important to my wife and she says there was more than ample drawers and closet storage space. Housekeeping was phenomenal! Absolutely 5 star all the way. Again, attention to detail is very apparent. It was clear the room was tidied extremely well twice a day. The bathroom was fully equiped and functional although a bit tight. However the private comod and the glass enclosed shower were 5 star. The tub was too big for my wife and she was uncomfortable sliding around. A peninsula tub pillow would have maybe solved this problem. We could have settled in for longer but our 3 nights were perfect. This hotel is exceptional. Service, attention to detail, super quality linens, towels, wireless internet at no charge, on and on. We have 3 children and we left them att home this trip. We probably would not bring them to the Peninsula as the other clientel might not appreciate them. However, Peninsula has just started a kids program which shows their willingness to enter this arena. All in all this is an outstanding 5 star property and I would highly recommend it to those who want a great Mag. Mile location with outstanding service and amenities.Look for a full Chicago Trip Report upcoming in the Chicago forum."
117,255,"Jun 4 2005	Nice but how about a better bed?	The Peninsula is a very beautiful hotel and the service was indeed top notch, but one of the most important qualities in a lodging establishment for me when I travel is one of the most basic---how well did I sleep. Unfortunately, this is where the Peninsula was well below a five-star rating. Surprisingly, the bed was worse than some I've had at mid-grade chains. Also, the room had a very high tech console on the bed stand with controls for all the lights and TV, but I never could figure out how to turn off the extensive floor level night lights that were so bright that I was forced to crawl under the bed and unplug them for the second night. All in all, next time in Chicago I'll go to a Four Seasons."
118,255,"Apr 12 2005 	Just perfect!	I stayed only one night from 1 - 2 April 2005 in a suite overlooking the watertower. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The service was perfect and also the food in the main restaurant was very nice. In the later evening I enjoyed the bar, a very trendy and popular place in Chicago. The 2 bedroom suite and the lovely bathroom made me dreaming. This hotel is just perfect and in my opinion the best choice for Chicago. Absolutely wonderful, nothing to complain about."
119,255,"Mar 27 2005 	First Rate Customer Service	We have stayed at the Peninsula twice now--first in May 2004 and most recently on May 20, 2005. Both times were without a flaw. The rooms are wonderful (even the standard rooms), the location is perfect, the dining is sumptuous and the customer service is unlike any other I have experienced, and we travel quite a bit.We once stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago because the Peninsula was booked, but still went to the Peninsula for the Chocolate Buffett which was to die for."
120,255,"Mar 12 2005	Great hotel!!	Well located off the magic mile, the decor and room appointment superb, staff of the highest calibre, services that boggle the mind--what a stay i had early march 2005, truly memorable!!The hotel is just simply one of the best i have stayed in from location to decor to staff to everything...i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wanted the best in surroundings and comfort.Well worth the price and very few hotels i have stayed in around the world could compare with all the peninsula has to offer....it is hard to describe absolute perfection!!"
121,255,"Jan 18 2005	No discrimination at the THE LOBBY	I heartily disagree with the review from a disgruntled dining patron of THE LOBBY at the Hotel Peninsula dated July 19, 2004 advising those who are not W.A.S.P.s to avoid dining there! I have dined several times at THE LOBBY while visiting my daughter in Chicago and have always been more than pleased. As a Hispanic family we have found the Peninsula staff to be very professional yet open and friendly to all patrons. We have always had 5 STAR service from the entire wait staff in THE LOBBY. The food is always delicious and freshly prepared to perfection. I have witnessed people of every race and culture dining at THE LOBBY and observed all were treated most graciously. The staff is multilingual and ready to make everyone comfrotable in their dining experience! I plan to have Sunday tea or enjoy the Chocolate Night Buffet when I am back in Chicago this March!!"
122,255,"Jan 8 2005	Outstanding	We had a wonderful experience. We frequent many 5 stars and would rank The Peninsula at the very top. We were there for 3 nights the last wk of May 2004.We booked the mother's day brunch at the hotel and that was so tasty with a great variety.We booked an executive suite. It was very nice with a well equipped bathroom. We had a TV at the tub and a separate shower stall. Most importantly, everything was very clean.The location on Michigan Ave was terrific for shopping. Almost a little too good as I spent alot b/c everything was so close!!We have stayed at well appointed hotels but what is critical to us is the level of service. It was outstanding here. A few mistakes were made but quickly corrected and a bottle of champagne sent up as a token of their apology. We took our son and that was great. They had my son's diapers ready in our room and a very cute bath set for him as well. My only disappointment was that I had just missed the cast of Oceans 12 staying there by a few days!"
123,255,"Dec 6 2004	Completely perfect!	From the 2 level entrance - to the LARGE, gorgeous rooms...this was a perfect experience! The service was unreal, the rooms were fully equipped with every possible modern tv,stereo, lighting toy possible, and the view was to die for. I took better pictures of Chicago's skyline inside my hotel suite, than outside. After visiting the Park Hyatt (one block next door), there is NO comparision. The rooms at the Peninsula are top notch, yet still maintain a very comfortable feel. The price? Yes, a little high - but worth every penny for a very special stay."
124,255,"Nov 18 2004	Great room and service but almost fainted at the brunch bill	Having stayed at the other five star hotels in Chicago, I was pleasantly surprised that this hotel surpassed the others. Rooms were wonderful and sumputous and the service was outstanding. I had requested early check in and was told they would try, but they could not garauntee it. A perfectly appropriate response. We arrived at 2:00 pm, with normal check in at 3:00 pm, and our room was not ready. They asked us to wait in the bar/lobby area and enjoy drinks on the house. They make a great $18 martini. We received a call on my cell phone and told that they had an upgraded suite available, if we would accept it. We had the Penn Kids package for our son, and he loved the goodie-filled backpack, as well as his own personal business cards. He also enjoyed the kid-friendly snacks delivered to the room (gummy worms, popcorn, milk and cookies). We loved the Sunday brunch, especially because they had a whole table of kid-friendly food for our picky eater. The only surprise came when we got the bill. For two adults and one child, our bill was $245. I admit that I had two glasses of champagne, but I thought it was included in the meal price. That alone raised the bill by $50. Not that we're piching pennies, but I do like to make informed choices. There is no menu, no pricing info available, and I didn't feel comfortable asking about the cost of the brunch. Everything else was top notch, we'll just go out for breakfast when we stay there again next week."
125,255,"Sep 16 2004	Plan an Experience...	Turn on the music, tap Privacy Please, set Mood Lighting, sip your wine, ...and plan an experience. And when Room Service asks if you would like your coffee cream warmed, just say yes. It will make their hearts happy."
126,255,"Sep 13 2004	Did not want to leave	I am currently undergoing withdrawal from the Peninsula. This hotel has been rated as number 1 in the United States on Conde Nast's Gold list and it lives up to its reputation. The executive suite we stayed in was simply stunning, as was the lobby. Great live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights in the lobby, impeccable service from front desk and concierge, fabulous bathrooms with a television above the bathtub are some of the many highlights. Although the hotel is a bit pricey, it really is worth splurging. We were able to get a discounted rate, complimentary breakfast, and a room upgrade to an executive suite by booking through a virtuso agent (central travel in Toledo Ohio). We will definitely be going back."
127,255,"Sep 12 2004	impeccable	The Peninsula may not be the newest or the glitziest hotel, but its intelligent staff make it one of the best. Our reservation preceded and exended past my husband's cancer surgery at Northwestern's medical center. It was a time of distraction and apprehension that might have been exacerbated by a disinterested place, a Hotel Land of the Living Dead. To a woman and man, the Peninsula's staff displayed quiet, professional concern by their words and actions. Examples: Sensing that this would be a difficult time for us, our reservationist booked us into rooms that were extraordinarily quiet, given the hotel's proximity to the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue. At a particularly trying moment when only chicken soup, not on the menu, would do, the Peninsula improvised smoothly and promptly (fresh fettucine and grilled chicken chunks in a tasty reduction, amazing, really). Housekeeping worked rapidly around our schedule, not theirs. Those who have traveled a bit know about phony attentiveness, and indifference. I encountered neither, not once, during our extended stay."
128,255,"Sep 1 2004	Excellent	Our stay at the Peninsula, Chicago for four days in July was absolutely wonderful. The staff was very proffessional but at the same time very down to earth and pleasant. The room service was great and our children were very welcomed and made comfortable."
129,255,"Aug 31 2004	It's interesting that 2 previous reviewers	did not enjoy the Peninsula, but I can certainly see their point. In the case of the Asian bar guy, it seems rather odd that his complaint had to do with discrimination when practically the entire hotel is staffed with Asians and other minorities. Anyway, as an Asian reviewer myself, I enjoyed my experience at the Peninsula and I am glad that I did not have the same experience. It's hard to deal with situations like that but the thing not to do is let it escalate. The Peninsula Chicago was avery pleasant experience for me and my partner."
130,255,"Aug 16 2004	Tea at the Lobby was a delightful experience	I had a tea with 8 other women to celebrate my daughter's 40th birthday on August 15, 2004. It was an absolutely wonderful experience for all of us. The service was impeccable and friendly. The tea was served beautifully and the food was very fresh and well prepared. My daughter was presented with a piece of cake that was served on a plate that said Happy Birthday Kristen in chocolate.There was a candle in the cake. This was a very nice surprise. After tea, we all went to the Bar and had the same wonderful, friendly service. Thanks for helping us to have a great afternoon with you."
131,255,"Jul 19 2004	Dont Mean to Rain on the Parade	Me and my girlfriends had reservations at &quot;The Lobby&quot; at the Peninsula Hotel this past Friday. I made reservations over 3 weeks in advance and called the day of to confirm, and everything was fine. When we arrived downstairs at the hotel the service was impeccable and everything was great until we arrived at the lobby on the 5th floor. From the MOMENT Johanna our &quot;hostess&quot; greeted us we sensed that we were not welcome. Not a hello, not a &quot;Welcome to the Peninsula&quot; nothing, this woman walked up to us, clapped her hands and stared as to infer &quot;how can I help you&quot; I stated that we had reservations and she said &quot;Let me check&quot;. After waiting for about 2 minutes, I glanced over to the reservations booth where I noticed Johanna and another girl pulling a sheet out of the reservations book and putting it into the lower cubicle, removing another blank sheet, putting it in the binder and flipping it back and forth, as to infer that they did not see us listed. After the caught me staring at them, Johanna walked over and said our table would be ready in a minute (obliterating the necessity of our reservation) We were seated and ordered our tea which was not allowed to steep and our Tea Refreshments were stale and took an additional 10 minute to arrive to our table. Not to mention the not so subtle stares we were recieving from the patrons. I couldnt help but wonder if &quot;The Lobby&quot; was used to having African American patrons, since we were the ONLY blacks in the whole room, save a bus boy who 20 minutes later turned into a waiter and was serving the people next to us. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life and I am appalled at the shabby service we received. I will NEVER go back and I strongly encourage non WASP's to do the same."
132,255,"Jul 5 2004	Great experience	Spent the 4th of July weekend at the Peninsula Hotel. This is a fantastic hotel. The location right off of Michigan Ave. adjacent to the Old Water Tower is very convenient. The service was outstanding. All of the staff were very friendly. The facilities are first class. The room was terrific with a very large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. There was a TV installed in the wall adjacent to the tub area so that you could watch TV while taking a bath. Everything in the room (e.g. lights, TV, A/C, etc.) can be controlled from a console next to the bed. There is a wonderful spa located at the top of the hotel with a great view of Michigan Ave. from the fitness area and the pool. This is a true spa and not just your typical hotel fitness room and pool. They have a great restaurant in the main lobby that offers a coffee and dessert buffet with live music on Friday and Saturday nights known as Chocolate at the Pen. The Sunday Brunch is simply amazing. We truly can't say enough nice things about this hotel. We are anxious to return as soon as possible."
133,255,"Jun 24 2004	Spectacular Hotel	Purchased a package at this hotel and it was delightful. I have traveled extensively and have very high standards when it comes to luxury hotels. The Peninsula met and exceeded in every category. Our room, an executive suite, was imaculate and extened from the building giving us large views of the city on 3 sides including the Sears Tower. It's in a great area and the service was nearly flawless. Of course, there were a couple of minor issues here and there but nothing worth even mentioning. If you're willing to spend the money to stay here, you will most likely not be disappointed and will probably be thrilled."
134,255,"Jun 20 2004	Luxury at your fingertips	This is one of the very rare places where you wouldn't want leave and go back home.Convenience and Luxury blend suprbly, adding to that the &quot;fine cuisine&quot;. I give this place six stars"

136,255,"Jun 3 2004	Great Hotel-the best	My wife, daughter and I returned to the Peninsula Chicago over Memorial Day weekend (having previously stayed there in December 2002). Having stayed at a number of Ritz Carltons and similar hotels, this is the hotel I'd love to move into. My 10-year old daughter and I love the pool which is roughly 90 feet long and has great views. Great gym and Spa facilities with views of the lake. While we did not dine at the fancier restaurants, our breakfast in the lobby restaurant and the adjoining French cafe were excellent. Staff was very helpful. As other people have said, the rooms are great and it can be hard to leave them. We are hopefully going to make a family tradition of a staying there every couple of years."

1,258,"Nov 3 2009 	Excellent location friendly staff highly recommended!	My wife and I stayed here in early October on a brief trip to Chicago. The hotel is ideal if you are going to a show as we were. Even in raining weather, we were able to walk to dinner and the show."
2,258,"Oct 29 2009 	Great Location	Great location, but after booking I checked the location with the orange suited guy on Google Maps, and realised there was the elevated metro on Wabash. E-mailed and requested a room away from the street, which we got. Background whoosh of trains, but did not disturb our sleep.Checked in with hand baggage so really never used any of the hotel services, except was able to use their internet facility and print our boarding cards back to Houston. Would have been nice to have a microwave, even with the ice machine and automat.Rooms at the rear would have been quieter, other than traffic.Great location with CTA train station at the front door and buses one block away."
3,258,"Oct 15 2009 	EXTREMELY QUIET Comfortable Bed with 6 pillows 	Even though this hotel is located on a street where the train runs right out front....it was so unbelievably quiet! When you think about why you go to a hotel in the first place, it's usually to get a good nights sleep! You will here. If you are looking for a room with a view...don't stay here! If you are looking for a good nights sleep...this is it. We did have breakfast in the dining on the ground floor and it was a nice breakfast. Staff was very friendly and helpful, parking and valet was a breeze! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4,258,"Oct 10 2009 	I loved my stay at the Silversmith!	I stayed at the Silversmith in Chicago for 2 nights on Sept. 13 &amp; 14, 2009. I loved it! I was looking for a small boutique hotel and it was perfect. Great location within walking distance to everything downtown. I thought the room and it's furnishings were very nice. And we were shocked at the fact that you couldn't hear the El even though it was right out the front door. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family!"
5,258,"Oct 8 2009 	Horrible Horrible Horrible	I stayed there with friends on the night of September 11, 2009. The valet person was lazy and took his time to move our cars and picked them up when we had requested for them. The front desk was untruthful in where to park which caused one of the guests to have her car ticketed and towed. The housekeeping was very unprofessional. We had requested more sheets and blankets at 4am and they took an hour to bring it to my room. I will never stay there again nor recommend anyone else to do so."
6,258,"Oct 7 2009 	Great location Shabby rooms	We stayed 3 nights at the Silversmith. We had previously stayed at this hotel and were looking forward to our trip. The Silversmith was a complete letdown. The bed was so uncomfortable my fiance barely slept the entire time. The bathroom was also dirty (the garbage was not cleaned out, one of the ceiling tiles had been wedged into place and had a piece of toilet paper hanging out, the tiles were cracked and moldy). The service was also so/so. On the plus side, they let us check in early. But they gave us one bottle of shampoo for the two of us for 3 nights. I finally called after I realized that the room had been cleaned but they hadn't replenished our soap/shampoo. The only great thing about the Silversmith is its location. It's 2 blocks from Millenium park, about half a mile to the museums, a mile or mile and a half to the heart of the shops. Even so, there are other better hotels that are just as conveniently located."
7,258,"Sep 30 2009 	A Real Gem	We just spent three nights at the Silversmith and couldn't be any happier with the hotel. We planned the trip primarily to visit the Art Institute, only a few blocks away, and the hotel was perfectly situated. We were very pleased with the room, the staff, and the especially convenient location. Great area to stay in, with plenty of attractions, wonderful and reasonably priced restaurants, and shopping if you're into that. We will certainly stay at the Silversmith again and recommend it highly."
8,258,"Sep 25 2009 	Great location deceptively quiet but gym and Internet weak	Paid about $170 a nite for three mid-week nites, which seems high but was the cheapest that week, it seemed. The Silversmith is a historic-registered downtown building that faces a noisy elevated L train. Don't worry: many of the rooms face rear-ward. Mine did, and it was dark, but totally quiet, did not hear the L at all. Room and bed was comfortable but smallish, which was emphasized by the large Oak furniture...happy I didn't stub my toe :)The gym was tiny, as many hotel gyms are. The wired Internet was very slow, made it hard for me to do my work. And I was disappointed by the downstairs Ada's deli...friendly wait-staff but food was only so-so."
9,258,"Sep 25 2009 	Nice hotel - terrible internet	Hotel was nice, spacious, and clean. Fridge and coffee maker in unit, but no microwave. Good location and a good place to stay. Amenities were nothing special. Internet was free, but virtually useless - I'm a network person and clocked my speeds consistently at 1/4 of traditional 56k dial-up. If you need to use the net (ie. business travelers), you'll be disappointed."
10,258,"Sep 16 2009 	Spacious rooms poor internet connection (hey it's free)	I stayed in the Silversmith for two nights during a recent business trip.I was pleased with the size of the room and the bathroom. Very spacious, especially for downtown Chicago at this price point.Pillows were a little lumpy.The internet was very, very, very slow. Many sites failed to load after five minutes.The hotel restaurant isn't anything to write home about. Hoof it about a block and you have plenty of fast dining options (Chipotle, Jimmy Johns sandwiches).Bell hop was friendly and efficient.Lobby area was huge but deserted. They've got lots of chairs and tables to relax in, but no guests seemed to hang out in that area."
11,258,"Sep 13 2009 	Good Location Well Mainatined Very Comfortable Stay	We stayed here for three nights in August. I booked at an unbelievable rate of $80 per night via hotels.com and I'm more than happy with the value I received for the rate! The regular rooms are quite spacious, with a fridge and very nice larger than normal bathrooms. The hotel is older and the rooms don't appear to have been remodeled any time recently. However cleanliness wasn't an issue. The place was so well kept and the hotel has a quality craftsman type feel to it. You could hear the &quot;el&quot; from our room on the seventh floor, but it didn't disrupt our stay. I appreciated the proximity which made getting around a breeze. Just a couple of criticisms; the mattress on our King sized bed was sagging in the middle although it was still comfortable. The sheets were looking a tad on the threadbare side. So the hotel could invest some money in those small areas. Also, the free wired internet connection didn't work in our room. Not a big issue, we just enjoyed the free wi fi in the lobby instead. All in all a very good value if you can get a discount as I did. For the normal price though there are other options in the same area that are just as good. I would stay here again if I were to get a similar deal."
12,258,"Sep 9 2009 	Very clean and great location	I used &quot;hotwire&quot; (crossed my fingers) and this was the hotel we got!! I could not have asked for more. The &quot;EL&quot; is right outside the door which made it very easy to get to/from Midway Airport. It was very clean, comfortable and very spacious. Also, the higher the better.. Our room was on the 10th floor so we really didn't get bothered by the noise.The hotel is located on the loop on Wabash and Madison, only one block from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. The staff was just great, they stored our luggage and were of great help."
13,258,"Sep 8 2009 	Excellent Concierge Service!	I had booked a couple days at the hotel with my mom, sister, and young nephew. We had two very nice rooms and greatly enjoyed the pleasant reception and warm cookies! My nephew was very happy chatting with the friendly staff. Most importantly the manager handled a potentially disastrous situation unbelievably well. I was leaving with my mother to attend a funeral in Mississippi after 2 days and we had to get an early start. I had sent my bags with the bellman on duty (5 AM) and the valet brought my van around. As the bellman was outside already and had opened my door, I assumed he had already placed the bags in the back and off we drove. We didn't notice they weren't there until we were many hours away. I frantically called the hotel and the manager assured me they would get our bags to us in time for the funeral. He had my bags flown down to me that very day and I was not charged at all for the service. It was the most unbelievable concierge service I have ever experienced. They really take care of their guests and are conscientious about getting things done quickly and accurately!"
14,258,"Sep 1 2009 	Excellent hotel in heart of the city	I stayed at the Silversmith with a friend for the weekend and had an excellent time. The room was incredibly quiet and comfortable, and the staff was very nice. They went out of their way to greet us in the hallways, and the desk staff was very courteous about our needs (arranging for a taxi, FedEx, etc.). I have absolutely no complaints.I haven't slept that well in a hotel room in a while!One thing to note -- the internet is free (a lot of hotels in the Loop charge extra for wireless) but it is wired, so you will be chained to the desk (they provide the cable). I was very okay with that."
15,258,"Aug 31 2009 	Excellent Hotel	My husband and I were concerned about the negative reviews, but were pleasantly surprised when we found the hotel to be very nice and the staff were excellent. I approached each staff member with a smile and they were very kind in return. The room was large and the bathroom was very trendy and huge!! The room was clean and linens and coffee were replaced daily. The only negative was the computer speed was very slow.We plan to stay there again next year when we return in August."
16,258,"Aug 29 2009 	Nice Room some L noise	Based on concerns raised by others on Trip Advisor, we requested a high room away from the elevated train that travels along the east side of the hotel. We were assigned a room on the 10th floor, facing east into a central courtyard that was open to the south. The passing trains were noticeable, though over the course of 6 nights we became less conscious of them. When we ran the A/C, we could not hear the trains at all. On our floor, the rooms that faced west, and would be least likely to experience the L noise, were # 1014 to 1018.Based on the hotel name, I had been expecting our room to be a suite; rather it was a slightly larger hotel room with a hide-a-bed couch, coffee table, and chair in addition to the normal king-sized bed.Maid service was good; the room was clean and odor free. The free high speed internet is cable (wired) only; there is no Wi-Fi available.The location is great! It is a very short walk to Millennium Park and the Art Institute. We took many walking, one bus, and the boat tour with the Chicago Architectural Foundation - they really make this architecturally rich city come alive."
17,258,"Aug 22 2009 	Bad Experience	I travelled with my 3 teenagers &amp; myself (the Mom) to Chicago, from Toronto, recently just for a few nights &amp; days.My goodness! not even bottle water in the refrigerator....how cheap! The staff were very rude!....They thought we were all kids...I Iguess!....Myself the Mom looks like a teenager...so I guess no RESPECT!I will never recommend this hotel."
18,258,"Aug 17 2009 	A gem in the heart of the Loop	My wife and I spent several days here celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, and finishing the research om my book about Chicago. This hotel is a gem. First of all, the price was fabulous. I found a very low rate on a popular hotel-booking website, then called the Silversmith directly and they matched it -- just over a hundred dollars a night. NEVER pay rack rate! The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and immaculate. Elevators were quick, public areas were comfortable -- we enjoyed our 4-night stay enormously and will certainly return next time we are in the city. Two tips: 1) If you are very sensitive to noise, ask for a room away from the street. The L runs right outside the hotel and you will hear it. In interior rooms, however, the trains sound more like a whoosh of wind than a clattering train. 2) There is a large parking garage half a block south at Wabash and Monroe. If you park your car there yourself, you'll save about $7 a day extra the valet parking costs. We just parked our car and left it, and used the L and buses -- order visitor travel cards in advance from the CTA website for great savings.The hotel is on the east side of the Loop, very close to Macy's (nee: Marshall Fields), Grant Park, the Art Institute, theaters, restaurants, and all sorts of public transportation. If you're here to shop the Mag Mile, Michigan Avenue is one block east, a 2-minute walk, where a five minute bus ride on just about any bus that goes by will take you to that shopping Mecca. All rooms in the Silversmith have access to free high-speed internet via an Ethernet cable provided in the room. It worked flawlessly. The restaurant is open from early morning until 10 p.m., but we didn't eat there, having our own favorites. It's not cheap. An inexpensive breakfast option is half a block south at Wabash and Monroe (across from the parking garage I mentioned) called the Corner Bakery."
19,258,"Aug 3 2009	Nice hotel with the exception of one rude front desk clerk.	My two sisters and I traveled to Chicago for a weekend getaway and stayed at the Silversmith for two nights. The hotel was a bit tricky to locate from the street due to only a small sign at the hotel entrance. We called the hotel and the front desk clerk was able to provide us with exact directions. We opted to park in the Self-Park garage located on Monroe Street (just around the corner from the hotel) instead of valet parking. The garage fee was $36 a night versus the $42 fee that the hotel charged. We checked in without any problems and went to our standard room with two double beds. Overall the room was clean and appeared to be spacious with very high ceilings. After a few minutes of getting settled in, we noticed a very foul fishy/urine smell on one of the beds. It was not only on the bed spread but also on the sheets. We promptly called the front desk to notify them and the front desk clerk, Rossi, was more than rude to us. He told us that it was unlikely that he had any other rooms with 2 double beds and he didn't know how soon a maid could come to take care of the bed. He then called back and in a rude tone of voice told us that he could give us a room with a king sized bed and a sleeper couch. We agreed to take this room. When we went back down to the front desk to get our new keys, we asked to speak to a manager. Rossi, snickered and shook his head at us before getting the manager. While the hotel manager listened to our complaint about the room and the rude treatment we had received, he did not offer an apology. After we left the hotel for a few hours, we returned to find a nice gift package with bottles of water, wine, snacks, and a card from management. The room we were moved to was a very nice suite. It had a refrigerator, microwave, and a tub with jets. We had no other problems with the hotel. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. While you could hear the &quot;L&quot; train, it was not an annoying sound by any means and did not bother us at all at night. This hotel was certainly not the nicest we have stayed in but for the price, it was just fine. All in all, we did have a decent stay at this hotel with the exception of our encounter with Rossi. All of the other hotel staff were pleasant. I think if we were to return to Chicago we would probably stay in a different location that was closer to the Magnificent Mile or the Navy Pier."
20,258,"Aug 3 2009 	Nice hotel...terrible staff!	We stayed here because we were going to a very nearby theatre to see Jersey Boys. The hotel was very nice and clean but the staff was the most rude and unfriendly we have ever run across! We passed a bellman three times in the course of our first day there, spoke to him and he just looked right through us. He is the first person any guest sees and he was extremely rude! Bad start! The young man at the desk when we checked in was a little better but not by much. The room was very nice and clean but you had to walk sideways through it because there was so little space between the end of the bed and a huge cabinet that housed the tv. Once you managed to get past the bed and cabinet there was a ridiculousy large office space. Tiny room with close quarters but an oversized office and desk?? Not a good thing for leisure travelers! We were awoken at 5:15 am by several 20 something women, obviously drunk out of their minds running and screaming off the elevator and down the 8th floor hallway. I called the front desk only to receive a response of &quot;What do you want me to do about it?&quot; Excuse me, is it not your job to make sure the patrons at your hotel are safe and comfortable? I could not believe his response!! We did talk to the front desk clerk about this when we checked out, but based on the simple response that &quot;she had no idea who that would have been that answered and spoke to me that way, but she would look into it&quot; I highly doubt it will even be repeated.It was a nice hotel and in a location very close to many things to see, but the terribly unfriendly staff made it a place we would not recommend or stay again!!Parking was $42 a day!! (The internet stats it is $30!) We chose to walk a couple blocks and pay $20!"
21,258,"Aug 3 2009 	Location and value rock everything else needs help	If you are unfamiliar with Chicago and driving to the hotel, you will need to be a detective to actually find the hotel on Wabash. It will take you several trips around downtown Chicago to find it. Cool building and ok lobby. Not very welcoming or warm feeling. Nice lady at check in. The rooms, while large are about the darkest and gloomiest I have ever seen. The couches are in dark greys and the lighting is very poor. Nice large bathroom and the bed was great and spacious.I would recommend this hotel if you want to be in a safe, downtown hotel and want to be a good location. Wonderful proximity to Millenium Park and shopping downtown. I also got a very good rate online, so if you are a bargain traveler, you can get good rates, here.When I go to Chicago again, I would not stay at this hotel."
22,258,"Jul 29 2009 	A Positive Surprise	We booked The Silversmith based on the reviews of others, but more than anything based on price/location. We make at least annual trips to Chicago, and have tended to stay somewhere along North Michigan. This was only our second shot at staying inside the Loop...and it was terrific. The location is, indeed, exceptional for Grant Park, Art Institute, downtown shopping, theater, etc. And El stations are literally at your doorstep. The entry of the hotel is almost hidden, but the rooms ar grand (we stayed in two.) You will read complaints about El noise, but city noise is part of the downtown Chicago experience. Don't stay here if you prefer the quiet, suburban chain hotels. This is older but in nice shape, large rooms, convenient to everything, and a real Chicago &quot;immersion.&quot; And the staff treated us remarkably well. It is our new favorite Chicago hotel. Note that parking is very pricey, but why are you driving into Chicago's Loop?"
23,258,"Jul 23 2009 	Very nice!	The hotel was a bit understated as far as the entrance goes since it really only has a doorway with little indication of what is there (I have stayed at the Palmer House a couple of times so compared to the big cheery entrances for the Palmer House, the Silversmith entrance is bizarre). Anyway, the staff was quite nice and the doormen (and they were men) were always friendly. The room (910 I believe) was great. A king bed and a longish padded window seat. A nice chair and good desk set. Our view was not that great but the room was quiet, clean and comfortable. I stayed here to attend a conference at National Louis University. Very close to the University so that was great. I also liked that it was so close to the institute of arts and Millennial Park (I think that is what it is called). Lots of nearby restaurants and shopping too. We especially like Gage for drinks in the evening."
24,258,"Jul 17 2009 	Refused to honor Priceline quote and receipt	The Silversmith has a certain amount of deco charm, and the location is very convenient to Millenium Park and the L train, but those are the only things it has going for it. Our room faced a brick wall, but I think the only other option was to face the noisy L train, so perhaps we got the best option of the two. We also asked for a high floor when we reserved the room 6 months ago, and we were put on the lowest floor. Most frustratingly, the hotel did not honor our Priceline quote. After quite a bit of haggling, they were only willing to knock $50 off the price of our entire 7-night visit, though our Priceline quote was much less. There were also a lot of small things that let you know that you weren't staying in a 3-star hotel, like the fact that they only order a few copies of the newspaper, so you have to get up early and rush downstairs to try to make sure you get one."
25,258,"Jul 14 2009 	Good location; friendly staff; average on the rest	Silversmith Hotel is an average hotel in a great location with a friendly staff.You are only a five minute walk from the Art Institute and Millennium Park and ten to fifteen minutes from Wacker Drive and the Chicago River.In terms of getting there, you are right next to multiple L routes and a couple of blocks from the blue L line that takes you to O'Hare. I drove my car to the hotel to drop off and pick up my luggage and the valet parkers and busmen were very friendly and allowed us to park our car short term in the valet parking area.Check in and checkout were handled smoothly and other questions were answered by friendly people at the main desk.The room was good-sized with the sleep quarters in a separate room from the bathroom and a pretty small living room. I liked the Arts and Crafts furniture.Bathroom had very good water pressure and was just fine, as were the bath towels.They followed their stated environmental policies and did not wash our linens or towels as requested.So what makes me give this an average rating?Even though we were on the side away from the L, we could still hear it from our bedroom (that doesn't bother me, but it did bother my wife). There were no shades to pull closed so the light came pouring in. The mattress was not very supportive, nor the pillows.The Internet was free and was available both wired and wireless. Unfortunately, the service was kind of poky and spotty. I tried going back and worth between wired and wireless, but had to give up a couple of times because it was taking too long.Business office was pretty sad. There were two pretty old computers that inexplicably used the wireless signal and not wired access. That limited its speed. In addition, only one computer could use the printer at any one time. As cheap as computers are at this point, I couldn't figure out why they didn't just buy some newer computers with better capabilities.The T.V.s in the bedroom and living room were 25&quot; CRTs and the remote didn't really work for one of them. It also turned on at a bracingly high volume.There were no recycling options in the building for paper, plastic bottles, plastic bags, etc.The power went out on Friday morning (utility issue, not their fault) and an elevator got stuck. It was still stuck when we left on Monday.All in all, I would stay at the hotel again, but given it was in the same price range as much nicer conference hotels, I would think twice if I could get into a nicer place."
26,258,"Jul 11 2009 	Low Bull High Quality Great Value	We arrived at midnight, and were handled efficiently and well by the night staff when we found them (a small idiosyncrasy of the hotel is that its lobby is not at street level). It was clear from the lobby decor that if our room lived up to the same stylistic standard we wouldn't be disappointed, and we weren't. Our room was first class. There was nothing in it that we would criticize, and it showed the results of the painstaking makeover which we knew had been done. Service, when we needed it, was also first class - easy, friendly and without frills; and the location is terrific. We didn't hear any trains on our side of the building."
27,258,"Jul 5 2009 	Great hotel location and value as long as you stay on courtyard side	The Silversmith is in the Jewelry District (about two blocks from Grant Park), and is immediately in front of an elevated train stop on the loop. The stop connects to four lines, which makes it very convenient to anywhere in Chicago. It also makes all street front rooms very noisy, not just from the passing/stopping trains but the train announcements, too. I stayed on the courtyard side and could still hear the noise, and the wind surges, created by each train. But, enough of the negatives. The hotel was very attractive, with rich oak furniture and paneling. The prairie dcor was reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright. The L-shaped room was approximately 600 square feet, with twin queen beds, a large bathroom and a large foyer. Lots of quality, small touches in the room. The service was first rate. My rate was only $122 (not including breakfast) thanks to hotel.com."
28,258,"May 28 2009 	Good value but a few downfalls.	The Silversmith is very promising -- good location, nice big rooms, right price. A few issues make it a bit less than ideal, however.The good: we had a gigantic room with a king bed and pull-out sofa, along with a huge bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. The price was right at $90/night from Priceline.The bad: The hotel is right next to the El, so it is a little noisy, even on the other side of the building. Of course, this is also rather convenient if you want to take the metro. The staff was fine, though at times they seemed patronizing (talked very slowly, described everything they were doing -- it was odd, though perhaps a Chicago thing?). Worst aspect of the hotel was the &quot;business center&quot; -- a pair of seriously underpowered PCs and a low-ink inkjet printer that probably came free in a bundle. Trying to print a boarding pass for the flight home was an exercise in patience at best.Overall a fine stay for the price, but nothing particularly great."
29,258,"May 27 2009 	Good Value for the money.	I booked this Hotel through Priceline for 80 dollars plus tax. Price was good when I booked it. Then afterwords, I started receiving promotions for 4 star Hotels for 100 dollars.Pros: My conclusion is for the money 80, is good. Clean, good bed, good towels, good and large bathroom. I 've got a room in the back, no L noise. Service is excellent, check in and check out ( they gave us a late check-out ).Cons: Although location is good, the Hotel is &quot;under the L rails&quot; which appears sad, odd and scary.Lobby is old, very old, big and dated. However, if you do not mind about it, it's fine.If you go during a weekend, I would recommend a more northern ( Michigan North) location...."
30,258,"May 23 2009 	Good hotel for a good price	Overall, I was pretty happy with the room, the location and the price. No complaints or anything. I enjoyed my stay here and would return to the hotel. It's not super fancy but you need to ask yourself what you're looking for..The hotel is located near the base of the L train and my first impression was that the area seemed a bit dodgey (and that was during the day) but the Hilton (Palmer House) is only a block away. Having walked around though the area a few times it seems totally fine. Also, the L train is right above the hotel and it's pretty noisy (I could hear it inside at the reception desk)The room is pretty large but rather dark (I was facing inward to a closed off area in the hotel complex. But if my option was facing the street and listening to the train, I'd prefer the inward view (and you could hear the train from this room but very faintly). The bathroom is large, the internet is free but they have an older tube tv. The fitness room comprises of two treadmills, a step climber, an elyptical machine, a bench and a small universal type machine. This is located a few doors down from the E. Madison subway entrance. I took a shuttle bus to the hotel and given the ride (over an hour and a half) I would recommend taking the subway/train. The hotel is also near the &quot;bean&quot; and the Art Institute of Chicago. Everything seems pretty walkable (Wacker street is probably a 15 minute walk away). You're within walking distance of deep dish pizza (Pizzano, Giordano's) and a bit farther out but walkable blues music (Blue Chicago)."
31,258,"May 21 2009 	The Silversmith exudes excellence!	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Silversmith. I am not from Chicago but knowing friends who are, they informed me that I was definitely going to be in a great location being one block away from Millennium Park and Michigan Ave. Once I arrived, the bellmen were very prompt and had my luggage handled before I knew it. One of the things I thought to be unique of the hotel is that the main lobby is elevated to the second floor. It was a very nice presentation once the elevator doors opened. The lobby was spacious with a nice atmosphere and the front desk was happy to greet me. I had a reservation for a suite, and it was absolutely gorgeous! There were very nice surprise personal touches in the suite including a variety platter. The suite was very large which was unexpected, and despite the L train I noticed right in front, it was very quiet and I slept very well. Their staff was helpful and friendly in addressing any additional needs I had. I highly recommend The Silversmith, as I will continue to come back and stay in the future."
32,258,"May 20 2009 	Great Place Doorman is a treat!	I stayed here with family while visiting Chicago. The rooms are clean, the bathrooms are of a decent size, and the people were wonderful. However, the doorman, Vincent, was the real treat! He greeted us, escorted us with our luggage to our room, and recommended some great places to eat (none of which included the restaurant next to the hotel.) On the way back to the airport, we decided to take the el, which drops off right in front of the hotel. He packed our bags (50 lbs each) to the platform for us!This hotel is clean, and nice. The lobby is a great place to hide out if you want to get out of your room and read. Be aware that if you're looking to spend a great amount of time in your room, there isn't much of a view - it's surrounded by buildings and the el runs right in front. Don't be too afraid of the el, though - from the rooms we were in, you couldn't hear it unless it was really quiet, and then it sounded kind of like the ocean. The location is great - it's surrounded by everything within walking distance. However, I would avoid two things: 1) The restaurant downstairs - it's pricey and not very good, and 2) Room service - it comes from the same restaurant. There's a corner bakery a 1/2 block south which does a great breakfast and lunch, or a diner called B&amp;B's that's on the west side of the next block south that is much better and has a great breakfast special.In all, it's a pleasant place, and great if you're on vacation or planning to do other things besides sit in your room."
33,258,"May 19 2009 	Not the greatest but ok	We checked into the Silversmith Hotel on Friday May 15th. We had a suite and it was spacious and suited our needs perfectly. We ordered room service the next morning so that we could sleep in a bit longer before our tour. This was most likely the worst room service I have ever had. We normally let things slide and hardly ever complain about service. They forgot one breakfast, cutlery, drinks and napkins. The food they did deliver was barely luke warm. I called down and was told that if I wanted it fixed I would have to come down to them, they only had two waiters on that morning. Finally my husband went down and the person in charge was not going to do anything to correct the error. The manager happened to walk in and when told about the problem he said he would correct the bill. To add insult to injury they automatically add an 18% gratuity to the bill. Our tour operator told me that we had a great place for breakfast and was astounded when I told her about the service we received. We checked out on Monday and the bill had not been corrected, the person at the front desk did so though. The location is good but for the money we spent I would go else where. Chicago is a great city to visit and we had a great time and good memories. I just wanted to share this so that others can avoid the problem."
34,258,"May 17 2009 	Rude and Dishonest Manager	The manager lied to us. We tried to check in twice at 10am &amp; noon. We checked our bags with the staff and were told both times that our reservation was in order but we should check in later in the afternoon. At 5:30pm, we were told that Silversmith had no room for us! They said that they could not give us a refund, because &quot;Expedia&quot; had our money. My sister had booked the room and prepaid in full through Hotels.com. They sent us a mile away (as we were walking everywhere, it was not a convenient location) with no compensation other than $10 for cabfare. We called Hotels.com and were told that they couldn't refund our $ because Silversmith already had it!"
35,258,"Apr 26 2009 	Girls Weekend - Great Hotel Choice	Booked through Groople at a decent rate (for Chicago). Was a bit worried after reading some of these reviews. But, no problem. Hotel rooms were spacious and furnished nicely. Great location, near the theaters, park, and restaurants. Only wierd thing was no glasses, only mugs, in rooms. Staff were all gracious and friendly. Kudos to Shannon, Patty and Vincent especially. Already planning next girls getaway for the same hotel."
36,258,"Mar 30 2009 	Weekend Stay for a Wedding	We stayed at the Silversmith Hotel and Suites this weekend for three nights. My daughter was married nearby and we arranged with the hotel for special pricing and to save rooms. Many of us stayed there over the weekend and we also had a private brunch in one of the meeting rooms. I can't say enought about the wonderful way we were treated, the beautiful setting, and the great room. They were willing to put the families on the same floor so that we could be together, pass out gift bags to our guests and helped us with the details and emergencies that came up. The brunch was wonderful and the servers not only did a good job during the meal but also helped us find boxes to pack up our decorations afterword. I just can't say enough good things about the Silversmith!!!"
37,258,Mar 29 2009 	Very pleased with the Silversmith	A very nice hotel with a wonderfully convenient location. My only real complaint would be that the hallway doors are very loud so that you hear all your neighbors comings and goings. Could get annoying with the wrong neighbors! At the moment access to the front door is awkward due to sidewalk construction but it was not a real problem. Valet parking needs 20-30 minutes advance notice to get you your car. Several alternative parking areas within two blocks.
38,258,"Mar 20 2009 	Fantastic hotel	Currently staying here for two nights with family. This is a beautiful restored landmark. Hallways are beautifully decorated and clean. Our room was immaculate, well-decorated, very pleasant. The main thing to be aware of is that this is a typical urban center hotel, which means the rooms are small. It's a tight fit for two adults and two teenagers, but the location and pleasantness of the hotel make up for that.If you are driving to the hotel, be aware that there is no parking adjacent to the hotel. A valet service is available at the entrance, but you may have to call the desk or send someone inside to let them know you are outside. Currently, there's some construction on the street in front of the hotel, which makes this a bit more difficult.Overall, a wonderful place to stay. A great value in the heart of the city. It's only a short walk to the Art Institute or Millennium Park."
39,258,"Mar 9 2009 	Best Kept Secret In Chicago!!	WOW!! This great hotel is the best kept secret we have found in Chicago. This is a charming place with beautiful rooms. The suite we had was great with plenty of room. A huge bathroom and beautiful bedroom were an added bonus. We surely were not expecting such a surprise. It is close to the L on Wabash but if you ask for a room toward the back you will have no problem with any noise. The rooms were large, clean and the staff were extremely friendly. The price is much more reasonable than any place we have found in Chicago. We definately will be going back when we visit Chicago again. Another convenience is the fact that it is located in the theater district so many theaters are within walking distance. Great place to stay!!"
40,258,"Feb 19 2009 	Nice hotel for a great price	Silversmith is tucked away on Wabash - in the center of downtown, walking distance to Millenium Park, Michigan Ave and State St. Plenty of places to eat and bars around. The room was pretty basic, but nice. The hotel itself seemed very empty, not much going on. Great place downstairs for breakfast - Adas - and drinks at the 14 Karat Lounge. Millers Pub is a few doors down - great place for drinks!"
41,258,"Feb 10 2009 	Wonderful Hotel	Really loved the hotel. Second time there. Paid with tax $114. My girl friend and I wanted a room with 2 beds and when we arrived at 1pm, we were told there were none available so they gave us a suite. My only regret is that we didn't spend enough time in the room to enjoy it. It was beautiful.The staff at the front desk (African American) was terrific and very helpful. Couldn't have asked for a better worker."
42,258,"Feb 5 2009 	Beware!	Don't let the reviews fool you, when the low price seems too good to be true, it is. We arrived and were very disappointed with the condition of the hotel and the neighborhood, and when we saw our room we decided we were out of there. The manager, Jeremy, said that since we booked on the internet (on their website, not some third party) they would not refund our money even though we were dissatisfied and were moving. He was obviously used to having this arguments with unhappy guests. Luckily we booked with AMEX and will dispute the charges but what a terrible start to our trip to Chicago. I even offered to let them keep the money for the first night and refund the second night, but they wouldn't do it. Can't deal with people who take your money for something and won't give it back when you tell them you are unhappy and won't be using their facility."
43,258,"Feb 3 2009 	Never again	It seemed like such a promising start: they had a room ready for me when I got there very early. Sure it was a queen, and I'd paid for a king, but I could put up with that.Sadly, it was all down hill from there...After heading out for the day I returned to the room for the evening and tried to set up a wake up call, but for some reason the phone in the room was set to 'rotary' and while I could hear it churning, it wasn't connecting with anyone. I gave up and set alarm on my watch and went to bed. But I couldn't sleep because of the stratchy things in the bed: turn out they were toe nail clippings. Yep, the bed had only been made after the last user, the sheets hadn't been cleaned. Disgusting.In the morning I went for a shower, but the setting on the shower head was stuck between two settings and wouldn't move. All I was getting was a dribble by the one cluster of massaging jets: the other two clusters were too full of gunk to send water out. DISGUSTING!I told the Front Desk this (again, phone not working... had to go down in person), and when I returned for my second (and thankfully last) night the shower was working properly and the phone working. And the sheets appeared to be clean. Unfortunately the rest of the bedding wasn't so good.I had noticed it was cold the previous night, but there was a major cold snap on in Chicago so I just put it down to that. That day, however, had been mild and so there shouldn't be a problem. That is when I really looked at the bedding (other than the toenail-ridden sheets) and discovered there was only one blanket on the bed. A summer-weight blanket. And the bed spread was also a summer weight blanket. Also, no extra blanket in the closet, as you'd expect in most hotels. I spent the first half of the night waking up every hour, getting up and turning the heat up in the room and then tucking myself back in and hoping it would get better. Finally, around 2 am I got up, maxed out the heating, folded the blankets over a few times and got fully dressed before returning to bed. I managed to sleep the rest of the night until my early wakeup call.When I tried to check out using the on-screen process it said that it could not be done. Great! Another stop when I am trying to rush out... I go to the front desk and am told that I couldn't check out that way because I had prepaid the hotel through a third party, and I had to pay for the incidentals. I said, yes, but I gave you a credit card for the incidentals at check in. It is the credit card that you just finished saying &quot;should I just leave it on your ...... card?&quot; I am treated to a lecture on how if I had gone through the hotel to book my room this wouldn't have happened. Way to punish your customers!To add insult to injury, I am coming off the elevators on the first floor and the bell man walks by, heading away from the front door. I am almost at the front door (a good 30 feet away) and I hear &quot;Hey you! Do you want a cab?&quot; yelled at me. No, I don't want a cab, what I want is something to help me forget the horrible stay I had at this disgusting hotel.P.S. It is a day later and I now have a major head cold. Wonder why..."
44,258,"Jan 25 2009 	Wonderful Experience!	I stayed for 4 nights in January. Got a great last minute rate through the hotel's website. I took the &quot;L&quot; from Midway airport, got off at Madison station, and was literally steps from the hotel entrance. The location absolutely cannot be beat! Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, comfortable and spacious, esp. the bathroom. The noise from the &quot;L&quot; was not bothersome to me. I would definitely stay at the Silversmith again -- very highly recommend!"
45,258,"Jan 20 2009 	Great hotel and price!	My friends and I came to Chicago for a girls getaway weekend/30th birthday party. We found the Silversmith hotel on hotels.com. The price was very attractive at $80/night and the photos looked really nice. We knew we didn't need a large hotel because we wouldn't be there very much so we went with the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly upon check-in, thanking my friend three times for booking at the Silversmith. The concierge was more than helpful with our bags, hailing us cabs, welcoming us back to the hotel, wishing us a good day when we left, and giving us accurate information about the city. The room was much larger than expected and the high ceilings were a plus. The bathroom was large enough for all 3 of us to get ready in the same mirror at the same time. Most of you girls know how difficult it is to get ready at the same time in one bathroom! We found that very convenient.We are already planning our next weekend trip hopefully in April and we would book here again in a minute.There is a cafe attached to the hotel called Ada's. We ate breakfast there on Saturday morning but wouldn't recommend it due to pricing. The food was good - service was slow - but the prices were outrageous. $4.50 for ONE egg... a block to your left is Dunkin Donuts and a block to your right is McDonalds. All in all though - we were very pleased! Can't wait to come back."
46,258,"Jan 10 2009 	Loved it-what happened to Housekeeping?	We (my husband and I)stayed at this hotel over the New Year holiday. The Silversmith was picked for its location to a Blues Club several blocks south on Wabash. Vincent was particularly helpful by calling a restaurant for us and helping with walking directions. No real problems, but the housekeeper never cleaned our room. Not a huge problem as we planned to re use our towels. It would have been nice to have the trash emptied. We will return despite that small problem."
47,258,"Jan 4 2009 	Silversmith is Good as Gold!	Our family of 4 (2 adults, 11- and 13-year old girls) along with another family of 4, recently returned from a 2-night New Years stay at the Silversmith. We booked on Priceline...2 standard rooms were $86/night (each). Super value. Stay was excellent all the way around. Rooms and beds were very, very comfortable and spotless. Had two corner rooms at the back of the building, 4th floor. No hint of train noise (of course, our windows were closed at this time of year). Bathrooms are huge, towels plentiful, shower function was perfect. Lobby is spacious and gracious, but not overbearing. Very good coffee/tea in the a.m. Staff were polite, helpful and prompt. Walking distance (even in 25ish degree weather) to State St. shopping, Milennium Park and Mag Mile. Attentive door staff and bell captain. Good elevator security. Building itself has been carefully renovated...very lovely. Will stay here again without question. A really sweet oasis. Note: check out nearby Pizano's for delicious, cozy, family-friendly Italian and Chicago style pizza."
48,258,"Dec 5 2008 	Silversmith Hotel 	If you're looking for a comfortable smaller hotel (only 140 rooms/suites), in a great location, consider the Silversmith. We just returned from a long week-end at the Silversmith, and we couldn't have been more pleased (our second visit to this hotel). We had two young granddaughters with us (7 and 9 years old), and the location was such that we didn't have to walk more than a few blocks where ever we went. Silversmith is on Wabash, which is between Michigan and State, and Monroe and Madison streets. Millennium Park is only a block from the hotel. The orange line stop is almost at the door, and the red line is about a block away. Yes, there is some noise from the orange train line, and yes, you can hear it in the room, however, we didn't find it to be a problem. During our stay we walked through one of the larger hotels, and it felt like we were in &quot;Grand Central Station&quot;. The Silversmith lobby is spacious, warm, welcoming, and very quiet. Monday through Thursday they serve evening desserts from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. They also have a complementary computer center which we used. We parked at the Millennium Parking Garage; cost is $22.00 for 24 hours. The parking entrance in on Columbus off Monroe, and about three blocks from Silversmith (we had no problems driving into the city). Just be certain you know exactly where you parked your car; the parking garage is huge with several entrances. The visitor center is located in the Cultural Center located at the corner of Randolph and Michigan (only two blocks from Silversmith). There is a CTA machine at the visitor's center (for multiple day transit passes), which can be used for the bus or trains. 3-day pass was $12.00 for unlimited rides. We used buses on Michigan as well as State streets, and the red line. We had a wonderful time showing our young granddaughters around Chicago, and look forward to a return visit. If you have any questions about the hotel or what we did with our two young granddaughter (don't miss the Children's Museum at Navy Pier, it was wonderful), please know I would be happy to respond. Chicago is very easy to get around, with so much to do, and by all means consider staying at the Silversmith!!"
49,258,"Dec 2 2008 	Great Stay	I stayed at the silversmith with my parents over the summer, and over all the hotel was a good choice.***TIP***We had a discount bc my father works for the government, you have to mention it during booking and then show proper ID, at the web site there is a part where they mention this, which is easily missed, so be sure to use this to your advantageThe hotel is practically steps away from the train stopGood and Bad depending on where ur room is, i had already read reviews mentioning this so i made a point on telling the person on the front desk to get us a room away from the train!!!At the lobby...which is very nice...there is a hidden buisness center with two computers and a printer which came in handy, so i was able to use it to print out the flight tickets and other web surfing stuff...but i must say the connection isnt that fast...but the access to computers was very convinientThe room was very clean...which is always one of my biggest concerns...and the view was not great...unless u consider looking out into an aley amusing...but overall it was goodthe bathroom was huge and that was really comfortable when you have 3 people wanting to use the sink in the morningthe beds......oh the beds....thats the only negative....there were two double beds...which really r not that comfortable for two persons to sleep in, and the beds where kind of stiff as in very stiff.....but everything cant be perfect!! at least the sheets were cleanThe hotel is at a really good location....i already mentioned the train stop....and the bus stop was i think about two blocks away....there was a wallgreens 3 or 4 blocks away...there were places to have breakfast subway, dunking donuts...a nice cafe place that i cant remember the name...and it was really really close to millenium park!!Ohhhhh!!!!! and i dont remember exactly where but i know it was to the right if u have the hotel entrance in front of u and taking a left there is Jareds!!!!! the popcorn place....u must go if u hadnt been there best popcorn!!! the cheddar one and the caramenl one are superb!!!Also...when i stayed the hotel had like a midnight snack going on...get there early and take advantage...they have cheescake, cookies, cake it was really good...the coffee...not so good , but it was nicereally overall the hotel was a good choice!!!!!"
50,258,"Nov 18 2008 	very pleased with The Silversmith	stayed at The Silversmith for a few days in Nov. Loved it.Was convenient to just about everywhere. I was initially concerned about the noise with construction going on but it was not a problem for us. We stayed on the 10th floor in a king size suite and was very pleased with the room. Bathroom is huge! Two minor complaints: the fitness room was pretty tiny , but for a few days, the 2 treadmills were fine....and natural light is limited due to where the hotel is located..but with such a great city to explore, enjoy the natural light outside! would definitely go back!"
51,258,"Oct 20 2008 	Good location - downtown	It has a good location: downtown, close to Macy's, close to the Millennium Park. But be aware: it is a noising neighborhood. The train passes in front of the hotel and makes quite a noise during the day. At night, noise level was ok.There is no thing such as a lobby on the hotels entrance. Its a little bit weird. The reception is on the second floor. The front desk lady (blonde one, forgot her name) was incredibly nice and smiley. The concierge is also very willing to please.There is no breakfast. The restaurant on the first floor has a decadent appearance with old carpets and lousy bathrooms. Food wasnt good at all."
52,258,"Oct 20 2008 	Love this Hotel	I stayed at The Silversmith Hotel &amp; Suites the weekend of Oct 17th with my boyfriend. The hotel is so perfectly located. Just a short walk to Millennium park, Sears Tower, most of the major attractions, great shopping, and eating. The staff were extremely kind and went out of their way to be helpful. Especial kudos goes to Ms. Peggy at the concierge, and Frank at the front. They were the most wonderful, warm, helpful and amazing people to talk to. The hotel was extremely clean, quiet, roomy, and comfortable. It was the perfect weekend with the perfect place to stay. I absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to have a wonderful time in Chicago. This hotel is outstanding."
53,258,"Oct 17 2008 	Good hotel in an excellent location!	We stayed at The Silversmith for 4 nights in July 2008.We thought this was an really good place to stay. The location was excellent - a very short walk from Millenium Park.The room was very clean, had excellent air conditioning, was very spacious, and had use of a free internet connection. Although the hotel is right on the road, we couldn't hear any noise from our room.Overall, I thought this was an excellent place to stay at a reasonable price. I would stay there again, and it is an easy place to recommend."
54,258,"Oct 17 2008 	Ok to stay but difficult to get into...	Let me start with something positive: the location. Situated in &quot;The Loop&quot; it makes it a top overnight accommodation for a tourist trip in Chicago. Most of the main tourist attractions are just a stonethrow away.Unfortunately, this has its downsides as well: There is no parking, so if you travel by car, you depend on one of the public garages or the hotel's valeting service, both rather hefty in price. At the time we travelled, there were building works on the streets around the hotel, which didn't make it easier.Second downside: getting in. We had booked our one-night stay via Orbitz in advance, but somewhere along the lines the hotel had lost the relevant paperwork. So we had to prove to them that we had actually booked our place there, which was annoying to say the least + we weren't necessarily treated with the utmost respect. After re-iterating that we booked via web and getting the reference number out of the publicly available computers there, they finally found the booking.The rooms were nice and there are pretty much all facilities you would expect, including a ice cube and a soft drink vending machine. All in all: If you have all your booking references with you and are prepared to drive into a public garage to go to the hotel to check in, then a stay at the Silversmith should be pretty much ok."
55,258,"Sep 29 2008 	Loved out stay	Three friends and I went for a &quot;girlfriend&quot; long weekend getaway. We found that the Silversmith fit our needs perfectly. We had a small suite style room which allowed for space yet conversation as well. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was huge, and the room was perfectly clean. The location of the Silversmith was perfect with Millenium Park, the Art Institute and shopping within short walking distance. Everything else is either a somewhat longer walking distance or a very short cab ride away. The staff was great--all very friendly and helpful.There were many restaurants in the area that we wanted to sample but we did have breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was cooked to order and delicious. One note of caution: We easily took the Orange Line from Midway to exit right in front of the Silversmith however as of 9/27 the El station in front of the hotel has been closed for construction. We took a pleasant cab ride to Midway for our return trip."
56,258,"Sep 10 2008 	Location Location Location	Reading the previous reviews, I called the hotel after booking on Priceline to give my cell phone number in case there was a problem. I also requested a late check in and that we have a room in the back.We arrived around 2:00 a.m. and the staff was helpful, friendly and efficient. Our King room was spacious and clean. Being in the back of the hotel saved us from El noise (I'm a light sleeper), but there is no view there. But, I didn't come to Chicago to look out the window. The location is cool because it's kind of under the train tracks and between two train lines along 'Jeweler's Row'. We were also a five min. walk from the Millennium Mile and State Street. It took the same amount of time to walk to the theater.Overall it was a great stay, nice hotel, good staff. I would DEFINITELY stay here again."
57,258,Sep 6 2008	Light Sleepers Stay Away	I had read about the noise problem due to the trains running next to the hotel and I had requested a room in the back. This did not minimize the noise problem. I couldn't sleep because I heard the trains go by every 5 minutes or so. The rooms are suites and are very nice.
58,258,"Aug 11 2008 	Enjoy your vacation...Don't stay here!	We booked thru hotels.com (Mistake #1). When the 4 of us got to the Silversmith they did not have a room with two beds for us. They had a choice of two VERY small rooms with one bed and a roll-a-way bed. They did not even offer for us to have both rooms. When we said this is not acceptable they said that they couldn't do anything about it since we booked thru hotels.com. We were only guaranteed a room, not a room with two beds. The L train is right in front of the hotel and kind of loud. The night we were there there was a shooting in that neighborhood. We only stayed there one night and will never stay there again."
59,258,"Aug 5 2008	Avoid this hotel!	Avoid this hotel at all costs! I booked a suite for my husband, nephew and me at this hotel in February. When I arrived on Friday, Aug. 1 at 11:00 am to check-in, I was told by the front desk clerk that they didn't have early check-in, which was fine -- or so I thought. I told the clerk that we wouldn't be able to get back to the hotel until after 9 pm that evening and she said that would not be a problem. However, when we returned at 9 pm,we were informed that no rooms were available, despite the fact we had arrived early, checked our bags, and valet-ed our car. Why did the front desk clerk tell me my later check-in would be fine?To their credit, they had reserved a room for me at another hotel eight blocks away, which seemed promising, but they weren't sure what kind of room it was. So they had to call the hotel and discovered the new room had only one bed. Where was our nephew going to sleep? They refused to pay for a second room to accommodate him. Throughout this interaction, the manager was decidedly non-sympathetic and non-empathetic (the desk clerk did the best she could under the circumstances). He never admitted the hotel made a mistake, he never said he was sorry for our inconvenience, he never offered us additional compensation beyond paying for the inadequate room at another hotel. In fact, he had quite an attitude. He did not seem to care in the least that he had ruined our trip, which was a Christmas gift to our nephew.The only empathetic people were the valet guys, who were very nice.We found out that at least two other parties had also had their reserved rooms given away that evening.Because of the rude management, deceptive (or, at the very least, incredibly uninformed) front desk staff, lack of professionalism, lack of customer service and general sense that they don't really care if a customer has a positive experience or not, I will never, never stay at this hotel."
60,258,"Aug 4 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	The Silversmith Hotel was in my humble opinion a fantastic place to stay. The hotel offers great accommodation in a historical building right in the heart of downtown Chicago without having to pay extortionate downtown prices. We stayed in the city at the beginning of July 2008 on the way to Las Vegas. The hotel is ideally placed to explore this wonderful city. I had read many reviews stating their was noise from the loop. This is the historic overhead railway. All I can say is I slept like a log every night and didnt hear a thing. Granted when you walk out onto Wabash Avenue the loop is directly in front of you and YES it can be noisy but tell me any city centre in the world that isnt noisy. A little tip as well...for a great meal take a right out of the entrance, walk two blocks and you come to Millers. Fantastic food with a great atmosphere. Would definately stay here again. My next trip to Chicago cant come soon enough!"
61,258,"Aug 4 2008	Too noisy	We booked two rooms for one night through Travelocity for $206 per room, including taxes. When we checked in, the hotel had reserved one room for 2 nights. Luckily, I had my comfirming email with me. They honored the reservation without question or complaint. (Thank you, Shannon.) We ended up with one suite and one regular room. Both rooms had views of brick walls and HVAC units--no view. The suite had a bedroom that was a separate room. The hotel is located immediately adjacent to the el train tracks and the noise from passing trains was very intrusive, even though we had rooms in the back. At midnight trains were still going by almost constantly (one to two per minute). It reminded me of that scene in Blues Brothers where they are at Elwood's place and the el rumbles past. Jake says, &quot;how often do the trains come by?&quot; Elwood says, &quot;so often you won't notice it.&quot; I'm a good sleeper but I could not get to sleep until I got up and found some ear plugs that I had thrown in my bag for a different trip. The ceilings are 12 ft high, the WIFI is free, and the location is wonderful (just off Millenium Park, a block west from the Art Institute). The valet parking was $46 per day. The Self Park at 55 East Monroe (about 1.5 blocks away) is the nearest, I believe. I paid $63 for 28 hours at the Self Park so I wished I had used the valet service. The staff was friendly &amp; helpful. Despite the pluses, I would never go here again because of the noise problem."
62,258,"Jul 25 2008 	Location is Everything	My friend and I traveled to Chicago for 4th of July weekend for the Taste of Chicago. Let me just say that the location of the hotel was outstanding. It is literally 2 blocks from Michigan Ave and Millenium Park, approx. a 5-10 min. walk from Grant Park and 1 block from State Street shopping. There's a Garrett Popcorn shop around the corner in addition to several other restaurants, shops, etc. Also the El is right outside the hotel door. Here's a tip, for convenience fly into Midway Airport and take the short train ride (orange line) to and from the hotel for $2 each way to save money on transportation. Great for downtown Chicago access!"
63,258,"Jul 15 2008 	Great Location	We enjoyed our stay. We had a king suite. The extra room, with the sitting area was nice after a long day of walking in Chicago.Location was excellent. We rode the El in from O'hare, take the blue to green and you get off a stones throw away from the entrance. If you do take the El, there are no elevators at that stop so luggage might be a problem for some. The El tracks were outside our window, but the noise was not too bad. The complimentary desserts at night were excellent. We booked our trip through priceline, no problems we stayed for eight nights."
64,258,"Jul 13 2008 	Great Location	I chose this property because of its downtown loop location. I wanted to be within walking distance to The Art Institute and the Harris Theater. I was only staying in town for a couple nights and was not trying to see it all! My room was very large, well furnished, clean and quiet. In spite of it being right under the El train; my room was very quiet - I had a view of a brick wall but it was quiet. All in all, I would stay there again. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is really spacious!"
65,258,"Jul 11 2008 	Silversmith for Chicago Blues Festival	We stayed at the Silversmith over the week-end of Chicago Blues Festival and before embarking on Route 66. We arrived at O'Hare and at the suggestion of others on TA took the public transport option, easy access at airport, journey was swift and cheap, with just one change at Clarke and Lake, the train stopped at Madison and Wabash which is just about outside the doors of Hotel, slight difficulty in bumping suitcases down the wooden stairs but not a real problem.Check in was swift and efficient, room located on seventh floor. Room was spacious, v. well decorated and spotlessly clean. Bed linen, towels and robes were of excellent quality. The 'fridge was a useful addition to the room for keeping drinks cool, store for soft drinks, beer, wine and snacks just across the street.The deli which is attached to Hotel was convenient for dinner on our first night, good selection of American cuisine at a v. reasonable price. There are a selection of restaurants in the immediate vicinity from steaks to burgers to pizzas.Despite ongoing work around Hotel and the train line just outside we weren't disturbed by any noise what so ever, you may just hear a swoosh! in the distance as the train approaches, which probably wouldn't wake the lightest sleeper. Alltogether a very good option for a Hotel in Chicago, close to Grant Park and all City centre attractions, we would definately stay there again."
66,258,"Jul 9 2008 	Never fails	This was the second time my husband and I stayed at the Silversmith, and we will continue to stay here, as long as the hotels standards are maintained to the present high level,the location is wonderful and the rooms are spotless and very comfortable, and decorated in neutral tones which is very relaxing, just what is needed after a long day shopping and sight seeing, only one slight snag on our second stay, we were given a room Instead of the suite I had booked, but this was swiftly corrected, this hotel is excellent value for money and I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone. We would recommend the Beef and Brandy restuarant for breakfast which is only a block away on State St, plently of choices and friendly service, also Millers bar is only a few minutes walk down the street and has a olde world atmosphere, a great menu, great staff, and a great reputation so richly deserved, its also very reasonable and with large potions. If you are about to holiday in Chicago, we envy you, we cannot wait to return to this great city."
67,258,"Jul 9 2008 	Great Value Considering the Alternatives	If you want a downtown hotel in Chicago and not go completely broke this is probably the place for you. It is literally a block away from Millennium Park and just a few blocks down Michigan Ave. from the Magnificent Mile.My group made the mistake of booking through Expedia, so we were not guaranteed to receive the two double beds we needed. All they had was a room with a king bed, but they gave us a roll-away without charge.The hotel is in a rather shady part of town (right under the L-train), however, the hotel is very secure and we did feel safe there. As other reviews on this site have indicated, the L-train is right outside the front of the hotel. They informed me that one way to avoid being booked by the L is to request a room with two double beds. All of those rooms are on the opposite side of the hotel from the L. Our room was off to the side, so we could hear the L, but honestly it sounded more like a quiet rain storm. We actually didn't mind it.The staff is a bit stone faced, but once you engage them they open up and are very nice. Maybe that's just a Chicago thing!Very nice hotel. If you are looking for a hotel downtown that is lower on the continuum for downtown hotels, than this is a great place."
68,258,"Jun 30 2008 	Good but not great.	We booked our trip through Expedia, and, because it was important to us to have 2 beds, confirmed with Expedia, and with the hotel, that we had booked a room with 2 beds. When we arrived, however, all they had was rooms with one bed. After some discussion, the front desk person booked us into a suite, with a king and a pullout couch, which was nice. Admittedly, I pulled the &quot;I am 6 months pregnant card&quot; to get them to do it, but hey, at least it worked.Our room was on the 6th floor, about 3 floors above the train. It was much noisier than I expected, given the other reviews I have seen. I imagine if you lived there, you would get used to it, but since we don't, it was distracting and noisy.The hotel is located 1 block from Millenium Park and one block from the huge Macy's in the old Marshall Field's building. All in all, a great area, although not super close to the Magnificent Mile."
69,258,"Jun 11 2008 	An Excellent Place	We stayed here for four days in June 08. This was probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We were a little concerned about some of the previous reviews concerning the train noise, but did not experience it. The entrance to the hotel is only a single door and small canopy on the west side of Wabash, so it is easy to miss. The lobby is up the elevators on the 2nd floor. Rooms start on the 3rd floor. The hotel is horseshoe shaped, open to the south, and our room was on the inside. There are about 15 rooms per floor. On our floor (6th), rooms 601-605 faced east to Wabash, and the 'L' train is right outside, so I would avoid those, especially on the lower floors. The only train &amp; street noises we heard, and only when the A/C was off, was a short, muffled, 10 second sound every few minutes, kind of like what you hear sitting in the airport terminal when a plane takes off in the distance. The room was fantasic. Very tastefully decorated in classic Frank Lloyd Wright art deco style. The details of the room were absolutely perfect, like is was completed yesterday. Houskeeping was extraordinary. The bed was very comfortable, but the pillows were thin. All of the staff was very nice and professional. An overall excellent experience! You have to eat breakfast at the Pittsfield Cafe, in the lobby of the Pittsfield Bldg, one block north of the opposite side of Wabash. Closed on Sundays. How about two eggs, bacon, &amp; two big pancakes for $5.55? We will stay here again on our next trip. The train to/from O'Hare stops 2 blocks west (Madison) and costs $1.75 from the airport. Hope you have as great of a stay as we did."
70,258,"May 31 2008 	Great Hotel	My wife and I went to Chicago for our 15th anniversary. A friend at work suggested we stay at the Silversmith as they had a $99 deal on Travel Zoo. It was a great experience.The Bellman and Front Desk are very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Even though the hotel is right next to the L train, we could not hear it in our room.The location could not be better. We went to go see Wicked - the play, and could easily walk to and from the theater. It is easy to get anywhere down town with the Visitor Pass for the publick transportation.We would definitely stay there again and highly reccomend this hotel."
71,258,"May 27 2008 	Worst experience!!!	My usual stay in a hotel rarely requires any contact with the front desk other then checking in. This time we were asked to wait for the room we booked or check in right away into a downgraded room. We decided to wait for our room. When we returned, they had a different front desk person on duty and a different story, take it or leave it. We basically waited for a room that didnt materialize wasting our precious time while on a short vacation. No apology. Non existent customer service."
72,258,"May 23 2008 	Great!	I stayed at this hotel for work on May 20 and 21, 2008. We were brought in by a bell hop that took our luggage for us. We had excellent service at the front desk. The room was very nice and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfy! The hotel is located right by the train tracks, but I couldn't hear the train from my room and it didn't bother me at all. My coworker could hear it in her room though, so I guess it just depends on where you are in the building.They offered free internet on two computers in the lobby, which I greatly appreciated! Most hotels that I stay in charge for the internet. They also had a dessert hour both nights of my stay and offered cheesecake and freshly baked cookies. The hotel is located near a lot of great shopping and the theatre district. We were able to get a cab right away whenever we needed one. I really don't have any complaints about this hotel. I would recommend it and I would stay there again."
73,258,"May 12 2008	FYI: Major Construction	While I agree with the positive comments posted here, beware that this hotel is located on Wabash with the &quot;L&quot; loop train tracks right outside. Currently, there is round-the-clock construction going on (rail replacement, etc). Heavy construction noise all night (trucks, jackhammers, chainsaws, etc). I don't know if this was just over the weekend (we were there May 9 - 11) or if it will continue during the week. Might be better if you have a room on the backside of the hotel."
74,258,"May 5 2008	Don't stay here!!	I made a reservation via Orbitz for an out-of -town guest, which requires the full payment of the reservation. However, I received a call from Orbitz at 3:30 p.m. today saying that the hotel couldn't receive my guest and that a full refund was my only option. So my guest was left homeless and I didn't get an explanation or apology from the hotel for the inconvenience. Please don't stay here unless you want to be without a room when you arrive. The hotel won't care if you paid in advance or not."
75,258,"May 1 2008 	Absolutely Wonderful!	This hotel was just lovely. From the moment we arrived, the service was wonderful. Everybody was so pleasant, helpful, and quick to offer suggestions. I read some reviews that the hotel was outdated. After staying there 5 days, I'm trying to figure out where that was. The hotel is furnished in beautiful old oak. Perhaps they don't like that look? The room was immaculate. The bathroom has gorgeous marble floors and countertops and is quite large, which was a nice surprise. As others have mentioned, the beds were fabulous. The pillows were fluffy, and the bedding was soft and warm. The comforter was more like a down comforter as opposed to those dreadful &quot;cotton flower bedspreads&quot; you get at a lot of places. Our room faced Wabash and the El is right there. We were never bothered by it and we were on the 10th floor, so we were pretty much even with the tracks. The location is fine depending on what you're there for. You're in the heart of the loop, where the financial and theatre districts are located. You're also only about 4-5 blocks west of Millenium Park. If you want to go uptown, it's a good little walk, or a $8 cab ride. Your best best, however, is to walk one block on State Street and take the redline to Michigan Avenue's shopping. This is my 4th stay to Chicago because of business and I've stayed at 4 different hotels in 4 different areas. This was by far the best."
76,258,Apr 27 2008 	Wonderful experience!	The Silversmith is beautiful! My family and I had a wonderful stay there. It is beautifully decorated and clean. The rooms are nicely sized. The beds are covered in pillows and real bedding- not the typical hotel bedding. You get real comforters and cotton blankets. The staff was always helpful and courteous. It was worth the money and not your typical hotel stay. I would stay there again in a heart beat.
77,258,Apr 26 2008 	I wish I could go back everyday...	Hotel was very clean. The staff was so nice. I think that this hotel was phenomonal. I had a great stay. They were very nice to children. The lobby was very nice and relaxing. It was a great weekend stay. Ask for Patty or Shannon because they were so kind. Bob was a great bellman. The Doorman was also very nice. I think the Silversmith Hotel is a great choice when visiting Chicago.
78,258,"Apr 20 2008 	Gorgeous clean friendly and convienient	I loved the Silversmith! The location was convienient. It is just a few doors down from the Palmer House. The whole hotel is decorated beautifully. The celings are at least 9 ft tall. There are floor to celing velvet drapes in the guest rooms. I loved all the light fixtures in the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed was VERY comfortable and had lots of pillows. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. The entire hotel was immaculately clean. Even the ice machine, vending room was spotless. There was a desk area in the room and the hotel offers free wireless internet access. The street outside is under construction and the EL train is located right outside the front of the hotel. Neither of those bothered me during my stay. We had a total of 3 people staying in the room. The sleeping part of the room was not really large, but adequate. The comfortable feeling made up for the less than large space."
79,258,"Apr 15 2008	No resolutions to problems by hotel staff	We called well in advance to request a room overlooking Wabash on the 7th or higher floor and also requested an early check in. When we got there we were told no early check in and they gave us a room overlooking the top of the building next store which was overgoing some kind of noisy construction. When we call the desk and asked to be moved we were told that they had no other rooms available as there was a convention going on and all the rooms had been reserved. We were attending this convention and had reserved a room?????Teleprompter in room said free bottled was available in the room, when I called because no water was in the room they told me the service was no longer available.The room was clean, the bathroom large. The hotel itself was somewhat dated but not upleasant.The location was fantastic, just around the corner from the theater district, which is probably the only thing that would make me go back. There is a deli and small bar on the lower lever.The bar is small and with very uncomfortable seating and windows looking out onto the street. Certainly not the type of lounge bar to relax in after a long day. The deli was nice.There was a nice gas fireplace in the check in level, however the room was so dark it was hard to sit and read the newspaper.Just o.k. with a good location."
80,258,"Apr 14 2008 	Great Hotel Great Service!	We used some &quot;Thank You&quot; points to stay at this hotel for a little getaway in the city. We live in the suburbs, so we were familiar with the area. What a great hotel! It's tucked away, so you may walk or drive right by and not even notice it. But that would be a mistake. The room was beautiful, clean and very large. The bathroom had a beautiful jet-tub and separate shower. The front desk staff was fabulous and had great recommendations. Don't be afraid of the L-tracks, we didn't hear them at all. This hotel is actually only a block away from the Palmer House Hilton, so it's close to shopping and the theater district. Overall, it was great!"
81,258,"Mar 30 2008 	nice hotel in the Loop	We booked the Silversmith for a short two day trip to Chicago, based on decent reviews and a great price (less then $100/night in the Loop). When we checked in we were upgraded to a suite, though on the street/train side of the building. We did not mind the train much but if you are a light sleeper, you would want to request the other side of the hotel. It basically sounds like a rumble of thunder that comes every 90 seconds or so. The room itself was very nice and spacious as it was a suite. Everything was in good condition. We found the location to be pretty convenient for transportation and close to many of the attractions. The hotel also has a dessert reception on weeknights consisting of coffee and cheesecake, etc. If I were going back to Chicago, I would consider the Silversmith again, but I would ultimately end up with whoever had the best rates at the time."
82,258,"Mar 30 2008 	This place is GREAT!	Wow! What a hidden gem right in the Loop! If you blink you'll miss it, but what a find inside! There is no concern about being right on top of the El tracks, I couldn't hear a thing! The rooms were clean, the bathroom was huge! The location is fabulous, walking distance to many things right in the loop, theaters, shopping , art institute, millenium park etc. Convenient, undergound parking in Millenium park (1block away). I'd highly recommend this place."
83,258,"Mar 27 2008 	Nice hotel but billing NIGHTMARES!	Stayed at Silversmith over Easter weekend, March 2007. Booked a Travelzoo special via their website. Upon checking in, was first told they could not locate my reservation, then they insisted on payment despite my reservation receipt showing I had paid in full at time of reservation. I was told their were only taking card for incidentals but after returning home noticed I had been billed again for entire stay. Front desk refused to provide at checkout stating the &quot;third party site&quot; I booked through would have to provide receipt. Calls to resolve duplicate billing were ignored and eventually filed dispute through cc to resolve. Having said all that, I really liked the hotel. Concierge Peggy was great, rooms were very clean and nicely furnished. El station was directly in front of hotel. King suites are good sized and deli on site had decent food. I tried to give the hotel another try and booked for Easter 2008 but then cancelled over a month in advance due to change in plans. Hotel again billed my credit card as a no show, despite my cancelling through their website and having a cancellation number. So nice hotel, but DON'T STAY HERE unless you want to be billed and billed and billed. Read other reviews, it's not just me!"
84,258,"Mar 25 2008 	Wonderful hotel!	We stayed at the Silversmith for a girl's weekend in February. Everything about our stay was pleasant. The room was exactly what we reserved, it was very clean, especially the bathroom, and very spacious, as we had a suite. Check in and check out was a breeze, with friendly and professional front desk attendants, and no problems with the billing. We liked the added security of needing a hotel key card to access any floor above the lobby. I visit Chicago three or four times a year, and usually stay at the Palmer House Hilton (basically next door) but for the value and positive experience beginning to end, this is now my preferred hotel."
85,258,"Mar 16 2008 	This place is a jewel....shhh don't tell anyone!	The Silversmith Hotel in Chicago was pure delight. This hotel was found by reading online reviews of about 40 hotels in the downtown Chicago district. I had stayed at two of the major hotels, meaning large chains, on prior trips and was looking for something a bit different. The reviews that people write are difficult to understand at times, especially the ones that had written about not finding the front entrance to the hotel. It couldn't be more obvious! Flags flying overhead with the name Silversmith printed on them, and the brass in-lay on the threshold as you open the front door reads SILVERSMITH! This hotel offered so much style, character, and class throughout. I stayed for 2nights, during the week. The room, with 2 double beds, was gorgeous, and roomy....very roomy! Ceilings were 12 feet tall, and there was plenty of closet space, a frig to use with bottled water in it, big screen TV, and a gorgeous bathroom with marble everywhere and white robes! I will stay here again. It was right around the corner from the theatre showing Jersey Boys. The L was NOT, in any way, a huge noise issue. Slept great as the beds and linen were first rate. Staff and help all very helpful! Am looking forward to another stay in December!"
86,258,"Mar 3 2008 	What a nice suprise!	We just stayed at the Silversmith this past weekend... What a great place! We decided to stay here at the last minute, so we preparing to make the best of our rushed unplanned situation. Imagine our surprise to find that the Silversmith is actually a very pleasant place! The room was more than comfortable and very well kept, and the staff was very helpful and polite. I'm glad we decided to give it a try. FYI: It's easy to drive by the entrance; It's very close to the corner of South Wabash and Madison."
87,258,"Feb 27 2008 	Great room great location great service	The Silversmith was a wonderful find through Tripadvisor for a girls weekend in Chicago! We all went to college in Chicago and know the area well so a hotel in the loop was very convenient. After reading reviews of other hotels we decided to spend a little bit more for a hotel that goes just beyond the basics, to make sure we weren't in mold, mildew and bad service. What we got was much more! Upon checking in, the room we requested, two double beds, was not availble in non-smoking so we had the option to have a suite with a pull-out bed. We took it and were very pleased. The room was spacious with two small closets, two TVs and a very spacious bathroom with plenty of lighting and a large, beautiful granite counter top and imported toiletries. A wired internet was available at the desk and offered a quick connection, although wireless was not available in the room.The El stop is just outside the hotel and we walked to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Auditorium Theatre, Macys and more. We only took a taxi to save time when traveling far.I asked for assistance on two occasions and the hotel did not fail. Upon my late arrival on a Friday night after 11 PM I asked for a late-night restaurant recommendation and the front desk suggested a few in the area. When I mentioned that I was pregnant and looking for a milkshake he offered to walk to the store and bring it back for me! When I checked out and asked the doorman for the closest El stop to the O'Hare blue line, with an elevator, he thought for a while and could not think of a stop with an elevator. The valet parking guy was next to him and said there was only one flight of stairs at the stop 3 blocks away and he volunteered to walk me there and even took my bags down the street and down the stairs. This was a very kind gesture, and I don't think he even noticed that I was pregnant."
88,258,"Feb 5 2008	Good experience until we got the bill	We had a wonderful experience with the hotel and staff until we received our credit card bill. Our bill at check-out time was correct but when we received our credit card bill they charged us twice for one night during our stay. After about 2 weeks of calling the hotel and conveniently the person that we needed to talk to was never there and never returned any of our messages, we finally turned it over to our credit card company to take care of, thankfully it was on our American Express. It is now February and we stayed at the Silversmith in November and the credit card company has still not been able to reach anyone at the hotel who can resolve the charge.I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you are willing to pay double price, in the already overpriced hotel."
89,258,"Feb 3 2008	Great Weekend Experience	My son and I spent a Saturday night at this hotel. We were in Chicago checking out SAIC and this proved to be an ideal locaton to walk to the Art Institute of Chicago as well as Millenium Park. Extremely easy to take the train from OHare to a stop no more than three or four blocks from the hotel.Hotel was clean, attractive, and the staff where competent. The staff at the front entrance gave us lots of good advice on food and getting around. Great experience overall. I plan to go back sometime to visit Chicago with the rest of my family and will stay at this hotel."
90,258,"Jan 26 2008 	Solid service good rooms	I'd stayed here about a year ago, but I just had my first stay since the Silversmith became independent. All was fine; the room (916) was clean and had a great bed, the front desk folks and bellhops were courteous and attentive, and the internet worked fine (though not wireless). I also paid for several rooms for my colleagues and the front desk made the process easy.The location is fine although it's right under the El tracks; request a room away from the train if you're concerned about the noise (I was on the opposite side of the hotel and didn't hear anything)."
91,258,"Jan 21 2008	Great Location for Weekend Shopping Trip	While not located in as glamourous an area as the N. Michigan Ave hotels, the Silversmith was a very positive experience. All shopping was within walking distance - the State St. shopping area was right at our doorstep. Excellent location also for theater, cultural and Soldier Field. Staff was very friendly and helpful. On site deli was convenient and hotel bar was lots of fun; it was nice not to have to venture outside on frigid January nights to have a nice evening out. The train noise which I had read about in other reviews was present, but more of a distant background noise which did not keep us awake at night. We took the advice of locals we met at the bar not to venture more than a few blocks south of the hotel."
92,258,"Jan 2 2008 	Great find	Great hotel and location. This hotel is on Wabash, a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue. If you don't mind walking (which if you are visiting Chicago, it is assumed you will be doing a lot of walking), the location is great. It is attached to a deli which has a wonderful menu. Even if we don't stay at this hotel next time we visit, we would definitely eat at &quot;Adas Famous Deli and Restaurant .&quot; Check in was a breeze. Our room was very clean and roomy, however we were located directly over the El tracks and it was very noisy. We went back to the front desk and asked to be moved and they were very nice and moved us to another room away from the El. We had a suite and it turns out they upgraded us to a larger suite. Each staff member we encountered was very polite and courteous. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
93,258,"Dec 18 2007 	Lovely boutique hotel	We stayed at the Silversmith in October. Yes, there was construction out front but the location can't be beat and we got a fabulous rate. I believe they said construction was supposed to be completed by Nov. 15 but call to make sure.It holds an old world sort of charm. The rooms were nice size with tall celings and the bathroom is HUGE! There were plenty of pillows and towels which can sometimes a problem at other hotels. The staff was sweet and attentive and don't forget Dessert Night w/cheesecake and sweets. YUMMY!If the price is right, I will definitely stay there again."
94,258,Dec 12 2007 	Great Small Hotel	I booked the Silversmith on a special rate and was pleasantly surprised that they upgraded us to a suite. The room was very nice and quiet. We were on the 10th floor and could hear the EL train as only a low rumble. I can see where someone on a lower floor might be bothered by the noise. The bell captain and the front desk attendants were very nice and very helpful with questions. The location is close to Macy's and within walking distance of the Art Institute and other places. We would definitely stay there again.
95,258,"Nov 28 2007 	Mold and Mildew Problem!	I really wanted to like this property and, I wanted to wait for a response from the hotel before I wrote my review but, 3 weeks later and no response.The Silversmith is a beautiful property in a very convenient location with a gret bar and deli on the property. The room and bath were large and nicely updated but we just couldn't get past the horrible smell in the room. This was not the 'room closed too long and a little musty' smell. This was a 'knock you to the floor when you open the door' smell! Overpowering mold and mildew stink! We told the front desk as soon as we checked in but they had no other rooms available. We asked that it be cleaned or sprayed and they said yes but, when we returned from dinner it appeared to be exactly as we left it. We went across the street to CVS and purchased 2 cans of Lysol spray and attacked the bath, carpet, drapes, bedding, etc. then left for the evening. We returned to a slightly better smelling room but, really, got very little sleep all night.Mold can raise very serious health problems for many people with any kind of respritory issues and should be taked very seriously! I understand that issues occur when you are running a business but what really bothered me is the way we were just waved off with no compensation or appologies. The staff was polite but ineffective in offering any type of resolution to this problem - even after I completed the 2 surveys they sent me - no response from the hotel what so ever!When booking a 4 star hotel such as the Silversmith, you should be guarenteed a clean and comfortable room. The Silversmith did not meet my expectations for the basics and my valid complaint was not handled well at all."
96,258,"Nov 27 2007 	Great hotel!	This place is great. The rooms are huge and well-appointed and very well-maintained. Great service, friendly staff. I would definitely go back and recommend to all my friends. Loved it!"
97,258,"Nov 15 2007 	great hotel poor view	We stayed one night at the Silversmith and asked for a quiet room after reading the TripAdvisor reviews. The room was exceptionally quiet but the view out the window was a brick wall. The room was cleanand the bedding very nice. The bellhop, front desk, and conciere were very friendly. We booked through Hotwire and paid $89 which for downtown Chicago is a great deal. One hint is to watch for the entrance on the right hand side of the one way street. It is not an easy hotel to find."
98,258,"Nov 6 2007	Don't stay here if you have any choice.	I would not stay at this hotel again under any circumstances.I was given a card key to my room. However when I got there, it was clearly occupied. Fortunately the person was not in the room at the time, however it was quite unsettling and the hotel had no understanding of why this might bother me. I asked what steps would be taken to insure that nobody would then go into my room. None were given.I was supposed to be in a suite. It was a room. The street is sketchy, and while there are hotel security personnel on the first floor at times, there is no 24 hour coverage. We came back late from a business meeting to find nobody there. Anybody could have followed us into the elevator at the second floor.When my colleague phoned downstairs to arrange a wake up call, nobody answered. This despite the fact that I had called for one seconds before she did. The street construction makes it difficult to get dropped off with bags and the El is noisy to say the least. Do not stay in this hotel if you have any possible options."
99,258,"Nov 6 2007	Not Recommended	There is still construction going on in front of the hotel, making it difficult to find the valet. L-Train runs right outside the hotel - not sure how it could be listed as 4-star hotel with the noise? Aftercheckin we went to our non-smoking room to find someone had just been smoking in the room. We went downstairs to the receptionist torequest another room and were told there were no other rooms available. She insisted that we got what we reserved &quot;a non-smoking room.&quot; And would not conceed that it was the hotel's problem that someone had just smoked in the room. She offered to spray the room down - but we wouldn't be able to enter the room for an hour. At this point it was 11pm and we were tired from traveling. When we told her we wanted to cancel the room she said we would not get a refund, even though it was the hotel's problem they are not enforcing the no smoking policy. We eventually got a refund through hotels.com, but theSilversmith could use a lesson in hotel management and customer service."
100,258,"Oct 17 2007 	The Silversmith Is An Excellent Choice	We just returned from a long weekend getaway to The Silversmith. After researching the many hotel options in Chicago we settled on the Silversmith for location, value and overall features. When we arrived there was some confusion regarding the room type we were assigned (a standard double) versus the room type we had booked (a suite). Unfortunately there were no suites available for our first night. The manager on duty, Jeremy, was very apologetic and blocked a suite for our remaining 3 nights. He also offered us breakfast at the hotel restaurant for our inconvenience. Since we are a family of four, with college/high school children, this was a reasonable compensation. After breakfast the next morning (which was very good) we moved to our suite which was excellent (featuring a very large bathroom which apparently is not the norm for downtown Chicago). The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The general manager, Jason was very responsive to our needs and also apologetic for our first night inconvenience. Peggy, the concierge, was very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly (calling us all by name after our first meeting). The room was clean and housekeeping was respectful of our schedule. The beds were extremely comfortable and the toiletries were first class. The location is outstanding, within walking distance to shopping, parks and a convenient cab or train ride to many other attractions. The lobby is comfortable and relaxing. I enjoyed the complimentary coffee and paper each morning. The dessert reception the evening we arrived was a nice touch (the cheesecake was delicious). The only negative is really beyond the hotel's control - construction. The sidewalk is torn up in front of the hotel making it a bit difficult to find and unattractive from the exterior. However, I understand that when it is completed it will resemble the look of Michigan and State Streets which are on wither side of Wabash. Even with the construction I would stay at the Silversmith again. It was a minor inconvenience. If you are looking for a good value in a great location with a comfortable, unpretentious setting and the personal attention characteristic of a boutique style hotel this is an excellent choice."
101,258,"Oct 15 2007 	Terrific Hotel	After seeing the other reviews for October here, I can't believe that we were in the same hotel. The Silversmith Hotel where I stayed on October 11 &amp;12, was clean, stylish, well maintained and the staff was wonderful. The only down point was the shower flow restrictor was too restrictive. The attached restaurant/bar was also delightful with great people watching and generous drinks. Tom the Bartender is great and always on top of whats going on.People should understand that this hotel is not a brand new Westin or Omni. This is a charming Grand Hotel in the style of warmth and charm, not brass and glass.The beds were comfortable and the room was a good size with great high ceilings. I was on the backside of the hotel and didn't hear any train noise at all. The location is perfect for sight seeing and transportation to any area of Chicago.All in all, it is a Grand Old Hotel and well worth a visit"
102,258,"Oct 2 2007 	Great Stay - Super Location	We just got back from our stay. I had read some reviews and was a little concerned about problems with the reservation based on some of the prior reviews. When we checked in, they thought we were only staying 1 day while we were staying two but they corrected it quickly and with no problems. The room was fabulous. Yes, we could hear a faint rumble of the train but certainly not enough to detract from the room.The location was perfect being so close to both Millenium Park and various train stations. The player piano in the lobby was nice. It would have been nice to be able to get a drink in the hotel somehwere. The restaurant was OK although my husband loved it as he was able to get a sandwich for breakfast.We would not hesitate to book a stay there in the future."
103,258,"Sep 2 2007 	Chicago and the Silversmith Hotel made a perfect mini-vacation.	I found and booked a three night stay at the Silversmith Hotel for the last weekend of July through Travelzoo.com. We loved the location downtown and the conveinence to Millenium Park and the transportation options. When we first saw the hotel we thought it might be a little noisy because it is located next to the elevated train downtown loop. Our King Suite on the eighth floor facing the elevated station was very quite and exceeded our expectations in every way. The room was large, clean and modern with a large bathroom, very nice furniture and a great bed that made us feel pampered. The staff was friendly and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable. The hotel lobby was functionable and nice but not a place where you would want to hang out very long, and the fitness center was small but adaquate. I did bring my laptop and was never able to get a wireless connection. It might of helped if I had asked the front desk for assistance. Overall we had a excellent experience at the Silversmith and would recommend it to everyone."
104,258,"Aug 30 2007 	Great Value	We had a great experience at The Silversmith. Reading the reviews we asked for a quiet room away from the El and I guessed received it as we barely heard it. The construction was a little awkward getting in but that's certainly not the hotel's fault and it's really not that bad. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The room was great. Very clean room, comfortable bed, large bathroom and high ceilings. A really nice room and great value for the price. Centrally located and close to most that Chicago has to offer. Called for some additional coffee and it was brought very promptly. Upon checkout we asked the bellman if he could hold our bags for a few hours. He jokingly said we had 30 days and after that the hotel would have to claim them. Just a nice friendly touch. Based on our experience I would highly recommend The Silversmith. It's our new home when in Chicago. And with our daughter and son-in-law there that will be pretty often."
105,258,"Aug 29 2007 	Hidden gem!	I received a notice that the hotel was offering a special rate on rooms for August and I booked online with no problem. This hotel is great. It is in a good loop location with access to the buses and trains and the room was wonderful. Plenty of light, big bathroom, great amenities and comfortable beds. The staff is responsive and very pleasant and even though the hotel is right by the &quot;L&quot; train, you cannot hear a thing in the hotel room. I would highly recommend you consider this hotel when looking for a place to stay in Chicago."
106,258,"Aug 23 2007 	Very disappointed in their customer service	My family and I stayed at the Silversmith on August 18th booking our room several weeks in advance through the hotel website. I had stayed on past occasions and found it to be a nice experience. When we arrived, we found the hotel entrance blocked by construction requiring us to be on the opposite side of the street to access valet parking..a trip around several blocks in traffic but it was accomplished. The valet had the bell person come from the hotel while we waited in the rain. Not a big deal. We were given our hotel room and when we arrived it seemed warm. I attempted to call the front desk but there was no answer. We thought perhaps it just needed more time but when we returned from a wedding later in the evening it was very hot. It took two tries to get the front desk but they sent up a bellman who looked at it and said it must be broken. He said there was no one around to fix it. When I asked to be put in another room, I was told rudely that they were full and there was nothing they could or would do. My mother, who has respiratory problems had to sit up all night, struggling to breathe. When I checked out the next day, I asked to speak to the manager. There wasn't one on duty. I was given a card to call later. The manager said that they would make a small adjustment in the bill..not adequate to cover the discomfort that the broken air conditioning caused...overall, the attitude was that if they are full, then they really don't care if their customers have had a satisfactory experience. I asked to be forwarded to another manager. I was forwarded to a voicemail and have still not received a response. I have used this hotel for business in the past but based on their behavior..won't be again.. To their credit, the bell staff were helpful, prompt and courteous."
107,258,"Aug 15 2007 	A Good Deal for the Money	They are currently doing construction outside the hotel and to be honest, the entrance a bit obscure. When looking for it, I turned the corner from Madison to Wabash and drove right by the valet, which is RIGHT around the corner. Had to go around again. Couldn't even see the hotel because of the construction fences but the valet pointed us to the hotel, thankfully.Doormen were very friendly, though they didn't seem very informed. We asked them where we could buy a day pass for the El and the first doorman told us a place to try. Then he said, &quot;Well, they might not be open,&quot; and then he asked the other doorman. That man gave conflicting information entirely, and finally they decided to call the front desk. No one answered so we went up to find out ourselves. Again, we got different information than either of the doormen gave. In the end we opted to pay the $2.00 fare for a one way ticket.Positives: Rooms were clean. We opted for a suite, which was only a few dollars more than a standard room. We were happy with the choice and happy to have a little extra room. Big bathrooms. Warm blankets. Peggy at the front desk is very helpful and accomodating. Previous reviews say that the El is noisy but we had a room on the inside and it was generally quiet. The whoosh of the El was still heard but it wasn't clanging like other people claimed. I'd ask for a room on the inside and you'll be fine. Location is great! El is right outside. There is a bakery one block down, a pizza place one block up, and Millenium Park is practically across the street. Walk about 5 blocks and you get into Michigan Avenue shopping. How can you complain about that for the price?A few of the negatives: a phone in the room didn't work, a light in the room didn't work. When I called Housekeeping using the &quot;Housekeeping&quot; button on the phone, they said they would bring me two more towels as I requested. 25 minutes later, no towels. I called Housekeeping. No answer. I called the front desk and repeated my request. Towels were brought to me immeadiately. If you're in Chicago for Business or to see a show, this hotel is right in the heart of it. If you want to shop, you might try to get a little closer. If you don't mind walking a little, you can't beat the price."
108,258,"Aug 15 2007 	Wonderful location and staff	My brother works in Chicago and recommended this hotel. It was our first visit to Chicago and we felt immediately welcomed by the staff there. It's in the loop, with great restaurants all around and very convenient to all public transporation. You don't need to struggle with transit maps, just ask the doorman for help getting to any part of the city. Two blocks away you can have coffee at Centennial Park, two blocks more and you are on the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; (though I don't know what's so great about it-- while the architecture is beautiful it's nothing more than an outdoor mall).The bed was perfect, the bathroom large and clean, the evening dessert buffet (free Mon. thru Thurs.) delicious and the concierge extremely helpful.Only problem would be if you had a room in the front of the hotel, as those rooms look out over the elevated train which is very noisy."
109,258,"Aug 13 2007 	I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!!!!	I was so thrilled with my stay there last weekend I had to make sure I put in a good word for this hotel! We went there expecting less than perfection but I can't make one complaint about it unless you count that the entry into the hotel is a little hard to find with the construction fence at the curb. I had to call the front desk to find the valet parking across the street but once I did, it was a piece of cake. Everyone there is friendly, courteous and helpful. All I can say to those who had negative things to say about the staff is maybe you get what you give. We paid an extremely low price based on a Travel Ticker special ($89!) and I expected to get not the best room. Instead of a king room we had a suite (similar to Embassy with a much bigger bathroom) on the 5th floor. It was overlooking the construction and the el but the soft whoosh of the el was not in anyway disturbing. Everything in the room was clean and fresh and the fridge with bottled water was a nice touch. I thought the Mission style was perfect and very relaxing. Even though there was a family with small children on our floor we never heard any noise from other rooms. The hotel location is superb ...tons of shopping, theaters and restaurants just a short walk away. I had to drive several times and never had a bit of trouble getting my car out when I needed it. I really love this place and I have stayed at several nice Michigan Avenue hotels in the last few years. If I can get anywhere close to the price I paid (instead of the $229 quoted on most sites that list this hotel) I will pack my bags again! I LOVED it!"
110,258,"Aug 8 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location Good Value	This is my second stay at the Silversmith Hotel. I love this hotel. It is located one block from Millenium Park, Michigan Avenue, Lots of Shopping. Super comfortable rooms and beds. The Cheesecake Dessert at night in the lobby is fantastic, and FREE! The staff is very friendly. NOTE: There is a lot of construction going on directly in front of the hotel, but once inside you hardly knew anything was going on. I paid just over 200.00 for my room, ( AAA discount available ) and compared to the other chain hotels in the area like Hilton, Sheraton, etc, they were all over 300.00 and more. Be sure to request a room away from the Train for a good nights rest. I will definitely stay here again."
111,258,"Aug 7 2007 	Fantastic	Beautiful, elegant, well appointed room. Huge. Wonderfully large bathroom. We have only good things to say about the Silversmith. Will definitely stay there again."
112,258,"Aug 7 2007 	Excellent value excellent location	I was attending a conference at the Palmer House Hilton this May. The conference rate for the Palmer was more than my employer was willing to pay ($250). So my travel agent found the Silversmith, just around the corner, for a much lower price (about $130).I was prepared for a more 'budget' experience, perhaps even a somewhat seedy one given the price differential, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Silversmith is a very a nicely appointed hotel, and a considerable bargain in that neighborhood. My room was lovely - large enough to get some work done in, a nice comfortable bed, a huge bathroom. It was both larger and considerably nicer than a similarly priced Comfort Inn I'd stayed in on a previous business trip to Chicago. Unlike other reviewers who have complained of noise, I didn't experience any disturbances.The location is great - right in the Loop, and right under the El - excellent access to public transit. I also had no difficulty catching a cab. Overall a great experience for the price, and if I was returning to Chicago again for work, I would definitely return."
113,258,"Jul 31 2007 	Once Past The Wow Factor	The property sucks you in &amp; then, when given a little time, the flaws start to show.I was at the Silversmith from 27-29 July 2007 for a wedding in the city (though no festivities took place in the hotel).The Silversmith is no doubt a beautiful hotel, especially in the common areas. The woodwork in the lobby is very nice. My room (# 314) was spacious but had a rather unfortunate view of a back alley (instead of the noisy El), which meant that trash bins were being clanged around at all hours of the night. Once you have a little time you realize that its not as spectacular as you thought when you first entered. You notice that the blankets are a little frayed around the edges, that a button or two wont work on the TV remote, that some of the finish work in the bathroom needs touching up, that the concierge gives you wrong directions to a restaurant, that the heavy drapes dont quite block out all the light from the spotlights in the alleyOne thing you would expect in such a hotel would be a nicer restaurant than what is on site. Adas is just what it advertises  a deli, &amp; one with decent food. However, there is no quiet place to sit with a drink of have a quiet conversation or a knock-your-socks-off meal. I guess the Silversmith gave up on trying to compete with Michigan Ave for the food scene  what a shame, as they could charge more, get better reviews, &amp; actually compete with other hotels in the area like the Palmer House &amp; the University Club.I would strongly recommend the bar in the hotel called the 14 Karat Lounge. Though loud &amp; packed with people, its a welcome respite from a hard day in the city. Tom is a phenomenal bartender who can mix a heck of a drink, give better directions &amp; suggestions than the concierge, &amp; gives you all the courtesies of a regular after you place your first order.I, like others, had some issues with reservations. After they failed to email the reservations 3 times I insisted they fax the reservations to me. It was received shortly thereafter &amp; there were no problems at check-in.I would stay at the Silversmith again, but the price would be a consideration, as there are other hotels in the area that may not be as nice but offer similar amenities at a reduction in cost. The location of the Silversmith is ideal, with Michigan Ave one block away &amp; a public parking garage a half block away on E Monroe saves you from the $37+tip valet fee you would be charged."
114,258,"Jul 17 2007 	Happily Surprised	Booked this hotel through Priceline, so I didn't choose the hotel when I booked, it got assigned to me, which always makes me a bit worried! And then I had read mixed reviews here, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I must say I was very happy...my room (404) was huge...I guess it was a suite, though that isn't what I had booked. They had ran out of baby cots, so they sent someone out to another hotel to get us one! The noise from the EL was there as others had noted, but didn't bother me as I had brought earplugs...other then that, it was absolutely quiet, clean and in a great location. Great breakfast at the Corner Bakery next door, plus the EL stops right in front of the hotel."
115,258,"Jul 15 2007 	A Hidden Gem	In Chicago for the LATE RIDE midnight 25-mile bicycle event, we wanted a hotel that was affordable and close to Grant Park, where the course begins and ends. We also wanted a hotel that wouldn't have a problem with us bringing our bicycles into our room. (Yes, last year, the hotel we stayed at would not let us bring the bikes into our room and we worried about them being stolen the entire time.) We booked a King Suite and were upgraded to a King Whirlpool Suite at check-in. After the bicycle ride, I was so grateful for that free tub! We absolutely loved the hotel's Frank Lloyd Wright motif. Our only &quot;problem&quot; was a long line at check-in. The problem was that the woman infront of us was upgraded, free of charge, to a better room and she couldn't understand that it was actually free. Yes, lady, this is something that hotels sometimes do because they overbook. Take the room and move on. We had our *active* toddler daughter with us, so after hearing this woman debate the free room issue for 15 minutes, we just wanted to get our key card and get it to the room. The room - WOW! We've traveled a lot and we've never had a room this nice for what we paid. The ceilings and windows were high. Breathtaking. We didn't want to leave the room come check out time. Hell, it was larger than our first apartment. The bathroom was huge. Shower, whirlpool tub, robes, thick and juicy towels. Bed was comfortable. I would have liked more blankets, but that's because I am a blanket person. No complaints from my daughter and husband. Room service was expensive, but it is at every other hotel as well. Free bottled water in mini-fridge was a nice touch. Great door men at the enterance. This is our hotel from now on for ALL our Chicago trips. (We come down often for cycling events.)"
116,258,"Jul 13 2007	Great location	We two ladies of a &quot;certain age&quot; planned a long weekend in Chicago in April, 2007. Travelzoo had a special for the Silversmith so as usual I checked out the TripAdvisor reviews. They were quite mixed but we decided to make reservations anyway since they had a good rate of $139 for a suite with 2 double beds. When we arrived from Midway a double/double suite was not available until the next day (there was a conference at the hotel) but they gave us our choice of a room with 2 double beds or a king suite for $60. We chose the King suite which had a bathroom as big as a typical european hotel room but the sofa bed was not very comfortable. The next day we moved to a suite with double beds which was very nice with a sitting room with two comfortable chairs/foot stools &amp; large TV. The El is very close &amp; easy to navigate from Midway. We could hear the trains but it was more like &quot;white noise&quot;. The bar downstairs was fun but lots of smokers so we weren't able to stay there long. Ada's, the deli was good for simple food, breakfast, etc. but Murphy's down the street was a great old non-smoking place with really good food. We walked to the Chase Auditorium for a taping of a PBS radio show and the two day tourist pass allowed us on all the public transportation to the Navy Pier, The Water Tower, Midway Airport and the train station on the last day. All in all a very pleasant adventure. I will agree that the hotel's reservation system could use some improvement but Brian at the hotel's desk was very helpful in making sure we were comfortable. If we could get another great rate I would definitely stay there again."
117,258,"Jul 11 2007	Our Downtown favorite	We have been going to Silversmith for several years and have found it to be a great place to stay. The location is close to everything. We usually go 2-3 times a year and park the car til we leave. Everyone is very helpful. The rooms are not huge but are well appointed and we are not in the room. It is close enough to walk to shopping, use the trolley for the museums, walk to the theater, walk to the lakefront or a restaurant. We live in the suburbs and know the downtown area and we choose to go to Silversmith when we want to spend time in the city. We have been there at all times of the year and have never had a complaint. The area is very safe at night too."
118,258,"Jul 7 2007 	great location but bring earplugs!	got this hotel for $80/night. it had a great location, only 1 block from the art institute and very close to the taste of chicago food festival. it's only 1 block to the &quot;el&quot; for anyone needing public transportation. the staff was very courteous and the room was larger than what we've stayed in before. the bathroom was large and the towels were fluffy. if i had any complaint, it would be that you can hear every door shutting and that was very annoying to me as a light sleeper."
119,258,"Jul 3 2007 	Yet another mishap with the reservation	Because of other reviewers' recommendations, we asked for a room away from the El. We had arrived at 1pm and had to wait until 3pm for a room to be available (understandable). At 3pm, we were given a room that hadn't been cleaned (bed not made, towels scattered on the floor in the bathroom). The room was also dark and dinghy. The front desk clerk was not very nice about our returning to the desk for a cleaned room. After 30 minutes of waiting we were given a clean room. Upon checkout, the front desk had lost all record of the group (corporate) credit card that had been used to secure the room and was presented on the day of arrival by the corporate cardholder, and wasn't able to process the payment unless we gave them our personal credit card (room was part of a conference and the corporate group paid for the room). No manager was available either in person (&quot;he didn't come in today&quot;), or by phone for 3 hours. We had to get someone to come to the hotel (from the conference at another hotel) with the corporate credit card (for the second time) to pay the bill. The clerk kept saying, &quot;there's nothing I can do.&quot; This is unacceptable given the $250 a night conference rate. This hotel needs to figure out how to have a functioning computer system."
120,258,"Jun 26 2007 	Horrible Dingy Expensive	We had a similar experience another guest did on this site - we arrived from Los Angeles in the evening and when we got to the hotel the room we were promised had been given to someone else but would be available the next night. When I said we had a confirmed room and showed the woman at the desk our confirmation number she shrugged and said &quot;we can't guarantee the rooms&quot;. THEN WHY EVEN BOOK THEM? This woman was unhelpful, quietly rude and didn't care in the least. They finally found a room for us and it was horrible. Dingy, dark, gloomy and the window stared right out at the EL and this was a $400 room!. We went out to dinner and checked out The Hard Rock which was fantastic but booked but their rates were $100 LESS and the place was fantastic! In the morning we decided to leave (and found a room at the Chicago Athletic Club - an affiliate of the Los Angeles Athletic Club where we are members so it was great). The Silversmith had promised to charge us the same rate we were quoted when I made the reservation but when we checked out they charged us $50 more and couldn't take it off the computer. We had to wait for 1/2 an hour while they tried to figure out how to fix this. And to top it all off, our daughter left a shoe in the room and when we called the next day they said they didn't have it. I'm not sure they even looked for it. Anyway, this hotel was really horrible. We couldn't wait to get out of there and practically fled with our luggage as soon as we could the next morning."
121,258,"Jun 23 2007 	Good location beware the reservation/rate system ...	Great location near Michigan Ave/Loop Area, Art Institute, Symphony Center, Millennium Park, the El, etc ... Nice rooms with tall ceilings and large bathrooms. Lobby on 2nd floor. Quiet if you have an inner room away from Wabash Ave. Would have ranked the hotel higher if it wasn't for the four months prior of dealing with the reservation system. Make sure you have a reservation # from the hotel directly (not just your initial internet confirmation #) before you go and have it in writing. And call to confirm during daytime hours when the reservation manager is there. Evening calls to confirm resulted in multiple reservations at the wrong rate or date (or being put on hold with an eventual disconnection) which had to be fixed the next day with the reservation agent. And several others with my conference group had incorrect room rates in the system which they had to fix when they checked out. But the check-out receptionist was very courteous, patient and helpful the morning of check out."
122,258,"Jun 13 2007 	Almost a great stay	Everthing started off well with this hotel until we checked out. The morning valet did not show up for work causing us to wait 1 hour to get our car. This caused us to miss a committment when we got home. Booked this hotel throught hotwire and when I checked my CC account on-line, the hotel had charged us for an additional 2 nights. The hotel claims that they never received payment from hotwire and hotwire claims that they were paid soon after I made the booking. The hotwire price was about half the amount that the hotel overbilled us for. This issue has not been resolved yet. I am not sure if I will stay at this hotel again or whether I will use hotwire again. However, I have used hotwire a few time and this is the first problem I have ever encountered."
123,258,"May 30 2007 	The Silversmith - Chicago's best kept secret	+ Arrived at O'Hare airport and took the Blue line CTA train to the Monroe stop (2 blocks from the hotel) for $2+ Hotel is walking distance to Grant Park, shopping, museums, restaurants, night life, Chicago river, Sears tower, John Hancock building, magnificent mile, Water Tower, boat rides, etc.+ Rooms are well maintained and clean+ Large bathrooms with marble countertops, lots of hot water+ Great security!

124,258,"May 29 2007 	Great Hotel; Helpful and Nice Concierge and Staff.	The Silversmith Hotel was excellent, the rooms are very comfortable and while not super contemporary very nice and inviting. The beds were super cozy we really enjoyed our stay over memorial day weekend. We arrived well before check in time at 3pm - arrived about noon - however our (upgraded) room was ready and suprisingly better than the actual standard room we booked (Thanks to the very corteous desk clerk.... )Also the concierge, Peggy, was super friendly and very helpful booking us last minute reservations for the comedy club ZANIES, which was awesome.This is a great hotel .. great location... great time...."
125,258,"May 4 2007 	Lovely Arts 	Stayed here for 3 nights Nov 2006 &amp; had a very good experience but since then management has changed so not sure what else might have changed too.Had a 1 bedroom suite that was lovely &amp; spotlessly clean. Very large bathroom. Whole suite was beautifully decorated, including great prints/artwork &amp; very comfortable bed. Only negative, not much natural light, as I choose to go with room at the back vs. front, which overlooks &amp; hears the El. Very good italian restaurant across the street, food to-go or dine in.Pro: loved hotel decoration style, historic building, close to EVERYTHING (due to EL), 1 block from Fine Arts museum, M Park + suites are really nice, good priceCon: rooms at front have natural light but very loud; ones at back are dark but quiet."
126,258,"Apr 27 2007	Do Not Book This Hotel Thru Travelocity!!!	Love this Hotel and will be staying here again in May BUT...don't make the mistake of booking the Silversmith thru Travelocity. The Travelocity booking does not &quot;cross-over&quot; into Silversmith's antiquated system and has to be MANUALLY inputted by some clueless off-site &quot;reservationist&quot; and it takes about 2 weeks! After 4 phone calls and unreturned email, I finally got the manager and I'm hopefully getting the room that I paid for. Travelocity did intervene and contacted the hotel and faxed them my specific request for bed-type and the hotel still got it WRONG. Hopefully the problem is fixed. I'll make one more phone call to the hotel before leaving for Chicago."
127,258,"Apr 21 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	Arrived late due to flight delays. Even though I had confirmed directly with the hotel a couple of days prior, I felt compelled due to an earlier review to call the day of arrival after I realized we would be arriving really late. Spoke with front desk and they said I was guaranteed and not to worry. So at check-in around 10:30pm, I was surprised when I was informed that the room we had reserved(exec.,2Dbl beds) was not available; however, she did accomodate us with an exec., king suite( 1 bed and a sleeper sofa- my 2 sons didn't appreciate that). She did offer to switch us the following morning, but we decided to stay put. Also watch your bill. We were charged $30 for parking each night and we did not have a car. After several phone calls, I believe it was resolved-I haven't checked my bank statement yet. Besides the above two aforementioned problems, the rest of the stay was pleasant. It was relatively quiet. Actually what train noise I did hear was more like white noise and was restful. Note, since they are no longer a Crowne Plaza hotel, they no longer offer the CD, ear plugs or eye mask or atleast that is what I was told.The breakfast, though limited, was delicious. The croissants to die for. cereal/hot oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, coffee/hot chocolate, fresh juice and milk and individualized preserves.Rooms clean and comfortable size. A little dark, but the high ceilings and large windows helped. Turn down service with cookies at night, great touch.Felt safe, esp. with the keycard and security on the ground level.Lobby on &quot;lobby level &quot;was cozy with fireplace and piano. My boys enjoyed playing when we returned in the evenings. Self serve coffee throughout the day.Conveniently located to millenium park, Ford theatre, restaurants, and shopping. Everything else including airport, easily accessible with train right outside your doors. The blue and red line approx. 1-2 blocks away-easy stroll.I would definitely stay here again, esp. for the $115/night rate received."
128,258,"Apr 14 2007 	fabulous hotel adjoining rooms	My family and I stayed at the Silversmith Mar 29 - Apr 4. The hotel staff was always courteous and helpful, especially Peggy the concierge. When I called the week before our visit to confirm the reservations (orig reservatns made in Dec), I told her that we were celebrating my daughters' spring birthdays. She arranged a surprise of balloons and a plate of cookies in their room the evening of our arrival. Also, Peggy suggested and arranged a flat rate limo for us from O'Hare to the Silversmith. The difference in cost for 4 passengers to take an airport shuttle vs. the limo is negligible, and it was wonderful to stretch our legs in a limo after being crammed in an airplane and crowded airport most of the day! It is difficult to find the hotel if you are not looking for it , but that was part of it's charm. The Silversmith feels like a club or private hideaway. We had asked for adjoining/quiet/non-smoking rooms and were placed on the 10th floor. The king room was spacious, with a roomy bathroom that had a large granite countertop and granite tile floor, the windows in the room were very tall and had deep sills that my daughter used as a window seat. There is no extra charge for in-room internet hookup, the refrigerator is empty for our personal use (no honor bar/weighing crap like at other hotels) and Mon-Thurs there are cookies and cheescake in the lobby. The hotel was in excellent repair, no peeling wallpaper; everything looked freshly painted; the hallways, rooms and bathrooms were pristine. I loved the Arts &amp; Crafts decor; the rooms each had old fashioned desks with wooden chairs on rollers; armoires with usable drawer space. The crisp white duvets and linens and very high ceilings also make the rooms appear roomier. The adjoining double/double room was on the small side, but had the same large windows, high ceiling and large bathroom as the king. The location was great, too! We were first time visitors to Chicago and were delighted to find that we could easily walk to the Art Institute, Oriental Ford Theatre, Macys(formerly Marshall Fields with Tiffany dome!), the Bean, and Giordano's Pizza. We also felt very safe at the Silversmith and the adjoining area. You must have an electronic card to go past the lobby on the elevator and the card only lets you get to certain floors (for instance, my card wouldn't let go to the 3rd floor only mine and the floor below.). The El is located right outside the hotel, but that was never a problem. It was a novelty, not a nuisance, to see the El cars go by at night outside the lobby windows. I would recommend asking for a quiet room if you think the noise might be a problem. Cabs are easy to catch outside the hotel, also. I wasn't sure what to expect based on the conflicting reviews on ths site, but I absolutely loved the Silversmith. I called several boutique hotels before I made reservations at Silversmith, and I can tell you that the Silversmith has many amenities that others did not offer, including adjoining rooms on top floors (other hotels only had adjoining rooms on lower floors facing construction), free in-room internet access, free refrigerator, and because we were on the top floor we had complementary breakfast each morning. I can't wait to visit again!! (and I'm very picky)!"
129,258,"Mar 14 2007 	guaranteed reservation? With a conf #? Ha!	I arrived at the Silversmith on 3/12 at 8 pm. My travel agent had made the reservation on March 1. I had a confirmation code and a print out saying that the reservation was &quot;guaranteed.&quot; But the &quot;reservation&quot; had &quot;not yet gone through the system,&quot; according to the sole front desk person (who made a phone call unrelated to my situation and helped another guest, all while I was waiting for her to resolve the problem). My colleague's reservation, made through identical channels after mine was made, had somehow been received by the hotel. The manager was not available -- he had &quot;gone home.&quot; I was told that I was being moved to a hotel more than a mile away and across one of Chicago's rivers. This was distressing to me as I had selected the Silversmith because it was walking distance from my meetings the next day. I explained this inconvenience, but the Silversmith told me that I could not be moved to any other hotel in Chicago except the Hilton Garden Inn that they had selected for me that was, as I said, inconveniently located. I was handed $8 in cash to pay for the cab ride there and then summarily sent on my way. I think I got one mumbled apology."
130,258,"Feb 16 2007 	That was a Crowne Plaza?	I had nothing but problems with this hotel. While booking online, I called the hotel to get more information and the pushy phone personnel insisted I book over the phone, not online.When they screwed up my reservation, I had only their word against mine, and the customer in this case was not right. I don't know who taught this place about customer service, but it was the worst I've ever experienced. The desk clerks accused me of lying, and even argued with me about how many towels were supposed to be in a room, since we were short of towels. Honestly, just send up another towel, why argue with me?After speaking with the assistant manager about the fact that my 2 night reservation was only made for 1 night(and that wasn't the ONLY problem, just the biggest one) he graciously offered me a room for way more than I had paid for the first night, knowing my itinerary left me too little time to change hotels. When I left the hotel later, I came around the corner into the lobby in time to overhear him making fun of me to the valet staff. He had the courtesy to turn red and at least stop talking while I walked out of the lobby. That was the most unprofessionally run hotel I have EVER stayed at and I will never be back. If you choose to stay there, get your confirmation in writing to back you up, and you'd better hope you don't run into any problems, because they will not be resolved.You may also want to take into account that the train is running right outside the door, and it's rather noisy. The supposed 'Frank Lloyd Wright' theme falls way short and feels like an excuse to have an outdated, worn-looking interior. For what I paid to stay at that hotel, I am shocked. I can't believe they call themselves a Crowne Plaza. They do not live up to the wonderful customer service and quality I have enjoyed at their other hotels."
131,258,"Dec 31 2006 	Great location good wheelchair access	My partner and I stayed here for four nights in May 2006. I'm a wheelchair user and chose the hotel based on price, location, reviews on TripAdvisor and the ability to check accessible room availability and book such rooms directly online. Other (especially Australian) hotels take note - the ability to check availability of accessible rooms and book these directly via hotel online booking systems is a real selling point for me, and probably other wheelchair users. It saves a lot of time and effort, and says a lot about a property's willingness to treat wheelchair users as real customers.The hotel facilities were good, and noise from the EL (noted by other reviewers) was not noticeable in our room. I felt the room was a bit dark in terms of decor and a little cramped with a wheelchair. The room accessibility was otherwise good (no roll-in shower though). Hotel staff were very helpful with obtaining taxis when required and made us reservations with accessible seating to see a show. Given that we arrived after a two-day train trip from Seattle, we would have appreciated a coin laundry for guests though.The location was a major bonus. There was plenty to do and see in easy walking distance (e.g. Art Institute, Architecture tours, shopping on the Magnificient Mile). I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get to major attractions and restaurants in a wheelchair.The hotel's onsite restaurant is a New York-style deli restaurant, which serves great meals and very reasonably-priced breakfasts. My non-observant Jewish partner especially enjoyed being able to order matzoh ball soup from the restaurant menu for room service delivery.Overall, a great experience and a hotel recommended for a Chicago stay."
132,258,"Dec 24 2006 	Cold Shower	I only ask two things from a hotel: bed and a shower. When you pay $300 for a night and can't get a hot shower, well you aren't going to get a good review from me.Had they given me a hot shower, I would have rated the hotel as above average. And offer of a free breakfast didn't balance out in my book with the very cold shower we both had to suffer through."
133,258,"Nov 12 2006 	very quiet room	Asked for a quiet room away from construction. Got room 814...which had no view, but was VERY quiet. 11' ceilings are wonderful. Had a long entryway with a wall blocking noise coming from the hallway. It's also in a corner, so not a lot of people walk by.The bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows, and the bathroom was a nice size. It was nice to have a mini fridge, too. Received a complimentary bottle of water each night (that was put in the fridge...nice touch), and turndown service with a couple of chocolates. The only problem was an inconsistent knocking sound coming from the bathroom sometimes. Closing the door helped somewhat, but could still hear it.Loved having to have a key card to get the elevator to go past the lobby, but like some others on here, had to have the card key remagnetized twice the second day because it wouldn't work. All of the employees were very friendly. Called about 1pm the day I arrived and was able to check in early. Was very handy to Garrett's Popcorn, Pizano's Pizza (try the buttercrust thin crust), and the Randolph St. station for the South Shore commuter train. Would not hesitate to stay here again."
134,258,"Nov 11 2006 	A little gem of a hotel	My wife and I have arrived back in the UK after a five night stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith in Chicago at the end of October and into early November.If you forgive the irony, this is an absolute gem of a hotel located in the jewellery quarter right in the heart of the financial district and in the Central Loop, 1 block south of the Marshall Fields Department Store (now Macy's). It provided us with an ideal and safe base from which to explore Chicago as tourists.After a lot of research and poring over countless Chicago hotel reviews, we decided to back the judgement of others and book the Crowne Plaza Silversmith via its own ICH website. What a great choice of hotel we made and one that is fully deserving of its high ranking on Trip Advisor! We think you will struggle to find a city centre (downtown) hotel anywhere with such spacious, quality and affordable rooms, backed by high cleanliness standards, attention to service detail and superb, polite but not over-effusive staff. For our part, we feel competent in assessing if staff attitudes are forced rather than natural. There wasn't a single staff member at the hotel, who did not acknowledge us on eye contact, smile when necessary and provided what we wanted when called upon. Truly remarkable!We decided to pay extra for a room with a seating area, having been the victims previously of undersized accommodations in San Francisco and Washington DC and we were allocated a spacious, yet tastefully decorated room on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel. It was spotlessly clean and well equipped and had a big comfy bed, superb bathroom with walk-in shower and marble sink surround, efficient airconditioning, and was a lot less noisy than we expected. We hardly heard the &quot;EL&quot; below and never once heard our hotel neighbours eirther side or above, even though the hotel was full every night.Two good restaurants are close by:1 - Italian Village - 4 blocks away - great food, superb decor, supreme service and all at a sensible price2 - Millers Pub - 1 block away - good food and service, extensive menu, excellent prices and a great atmosphere as wellWe will certainly visit Chicago again in future and stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith but during Summer next time."
135,258,"Nov 1 2006	beautiful but noisy	I stayed at the Crown Plaza in September 06 and should have heeded a tripadvisor review to get a room away from the L. It is a very nice hotel, very comfy room, but there is the regular whooshing sound of the L. The complimentary bag of sleep aids, including earplugs are a nice touch, and they did help. However, I would only go back if I could be assured of a room away from the L."
136,258,"Oct 19 2006 	Nice hotel but some glitches	I recently stayed for 4 days at the hotel. One of the best features is it's location and service but the staff seemed 'understaffed'. For the most part, every one was very professional and accomodating (except for one concierge who suggested I call the restaurant to change my reservations). It just seemed like they needed one more person. The hotel was full at the time which may explain the situation. There were several 'glitches' ; the room keys easily became demagnitized and didn't work; the safe in my room needed some maintenance; and room service didn't deliver breakfast at the requested time. On a positive note, there were several nice amenities, including comfortable beds/pillows, housekeeping, a relaxation CD, earplugs, dark velvet draperies that darkened the room, cheesecake in the lobby during the evenings, and personal wake up call that included the daily weather report. If you are planning to make a reservation in the near future, request a room away from the construction taking place across the street."
137,258,"Oct 5 2006	Hard to Find but Worth it	This is a great location for downtown Chicago events. Suite was lovely, and reasonably priced. But as usual: ask the desk clerk for discounts until you get what you think you should get. The Frank Lloyd Wright motif went throughout the hotel, and the coordination was rather soothing, but the uniform brown was monotonoujs. Except you'd really have to take it up with Frank Lloyd Wright. Only problem was the restaurant downstairs, which was frankly not good food. But the pizza parlor across Wabash was fine."
138,258,"Oct 2 2006	Excellent location	Hotel was centrally located to attractions and within easy walking distance. Enjoyed the beautiful room and the turndown service. If staying go to the Italian Village, a short walk, the food was awesome. Would definitely stay her again in the future."
139,258,"Sep 18 2006 	Fantastic Find	My wife and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza this weekend, Sept. 15-17. We were amazed how good the hotel was, from the location (next to the L) to the great service and rooms. After looking to find a hotel we choose this one by the user feedback on this site and couldn't have been happier. We got a rate of $189 a night!!Location: Next to the L and a block from the Millennium Park. Also a 10 minute walk to Michigan Ave. Couldn't pick a better spot in terms of walkability. Another plus is there's a restaurant across the street that's open till 3AM, which we tried when our flight was delayed and got in at 11PM. A nice bonus.Room: We requested and got a room towards the back so we wouldn't be bothered by the L. The room was very clean, very comfortable bed, and large bathroom. The room was very quiet and comfortable. Service: Very good. Fast check-in, helpful in getting directions, and coffee in the lobby in the morning for those early departures to the airport.As far as I'm concerned, the best value in Chicago and I will not stay anywhere else in the future."
140,258,"Sep 4 2006	Great Service and Location	It is rare for a hotel's service to exceed expectations. I make a point of selecting hotels based on comments made on TripAdvisor, and as a result, set high expectations. The Silversmith exceeded my high expectations. They deserve my time to stop and make an endorsement. The hotel's overall facility, rooms, and bathrooms are upscale and in very good condition. Relaxing classical music is played in the lobby and the staff covers every detail in making sure you get a quiet night's sleep as part of the Crown Plaza Hotels Sleep Program. Our requests for amenities were addressed promptly and courteously by every staff member we met. In summary, it is a First Class hotel.The Silversmith is also perfectly located for walking access to Milennium Park, Grant Park, Marshall Field's, the gorgeous waterfront and it's walking path to all of the major museums including the Art and Field Museums. There are also plenty of fine dining and quick bite establishments surrounding the hotel.For anyone seeking a great place to stay while touring downtown Chicago, The Silversmith is your best bet."
141,258,"Aug 29 2006 	Talk about service!!!!	I had to go to Chicago for a week for some training, I had also taken my daughter, mom, and little sister (I figured they could play and sightsee while I worked.) WHAT A GREAT HOTEL!!! They were extremely courteous, upgraded us to a suite no problem and no charge. Housekeeping to the front desk employees bent over backwards to help us with everything!! There was also a dessert bar every night (Mon-Thur) at 9pm in the lobby! The El was not noisy like I thought it would be in the room, outside standing underneath it is different. GO Eat at Carmine's, and Italian Village. ADA's was great too and located at the hotel. The Valet service was great, busy but great!! It's worth the $30/day to not have to park it yourself! I HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. FANTASTIC!!!"
142,258,"Jul 25 2006 	Excellent	We booked the Silversmith to meet up with family whilst staying in Chicago.Location is good, but right on the loop, so best to request room at the back of the hotel - it must be noisy at the front. Easily walk to most of the attractions, but station is right outside for those further afield.Rooms were excellently presented. We had a suite, and had plenty of room to stretch out. Bathroom was very clean.There is no bar, but Millers pub is only 1 block South, and worth a visit."
143,258,"Jul 16 2006	Why Stay Anywhere Else? (Unless you have to)	Positives:Peggi T conceirge is the soul of the hotel - inspiring, big hearted. Good value for quality product, much better stay here than Ive had at some Chi megahotels.Free high speed internet access at this hotel - at some hotels this is $13 extraFree access to 800 numbers, unlike at Starwood hotels where theres often a $2 per call access feeCordless phone in room is appreciated.Nice, tasteful Prarie style decor, refreshingly  not generic, no cookie cutter look to the hotel. Real oak furniture and doors, comfortable look in room, good lighting.CD player, clock radio wasnt as tinny as most hotels.Good sized bathrooms with close up make up mirrors, granite countertops.Location located right at the el subway stop - extremely convenient and I took the ride from the airport one transfer right to the hotel for under $2. Within two blocks find Art Inst, dept stores, many restaurants, kinkos/Fed Exp. Personnel that ask How is your stay? you have a chance to respond and get resolution then and there.Employees at the hotel are alert, hospitable, good communication with all levels of hotel empoyeesBathrooms had comfortable robes,Bedspreads looked clean without a historyPatrice Brazil, all the conceirges and front desk employees good.Peggi T, the conceirge youve read about on this site, i-s inspiring, and helpful, soul of the hotel - we didnt need special services but we were enriched by her presence and comments.Good quality in room coffee and coffee maker, fridge thats quiet, Free in room safes that Four Points hotels sometimes dont provide - helpful for storing passport, IDs, laptop.Excellent security - one needs hotel guest key card to access your floorEnough staff on duty at front desk unlike some hotels.No signature fragrance in public areas, as Starwood hotels has doneClean, fragrance free environs - no disguising hotel odorsDoormen are very efficient, they pay attentionHousekeeping staff really good - supervisors check, follow upNegatives:Shower head doesnt release strong torrent of water - it's ok.Adas Restaurant downstairs - best to skip this food thats an embarrassement to the taste buds - huge portions, reasonably priced, not very good food - with maybe the worst coffee weve had, food has too much deep frying, the corned beef tasted like turkey or ham corn beef, the noodle krugle overkilled with sweetness. Needed: a fresh menu of fewer, higher quality choices. Service is good.Executive guest floor breakfast has uninspired pastries and breads, a toaster to warm bagels/rolls should be on public view instead of in the kitchen area hidden from view. Loud, intrusive TV in small breakfast lounge on 10th floor. Room closed after breakfast. Hotel doesnt list how much local calls are or 800 numbers,No tongs with ice buckets.Lobby could use a little more personal touch - such as magazines, newspapers, fresh flowers for friendly ambience.Overall, good find that we wouldn't known about unless tripadvisor reviews told about it - thanks everyone! A very good hotel overall.Why stay anywhere else?"
144,258,"Jul 13 2006	Unbelievable Hotel for the money	This was our 4th trip to Chicago, but our first staying downtown (in the Loop). The Silversmith Crown Plaza was an unbelieveable. We arrived the weekend before the 4th of July. Starting with checking in, we were completley taken care. The hotel staff could not be beat!!! They were the best staff I have seen at any hotel I have ever stayed at and being in the military for 23 years, I have stayed at quite a few. The rooms were large with very comfortable beds. There was a turndown service everynight, with chocolates my kids looked forward to. The bath rooms were huge for hotels. The intricate tile floors and high ceilings spoke a lot of the quality of this fine establishment. The concierge was extrememly helpful for directions, places to go, etc... I wish I would have listened to her when she told me how to get to the Science and Industry Museum. She gave me the bus routes to get dropped off at the front door of the museum. I decided on my own to take the El and found out the museum was 3 miles from the stop in a VERY rough part of town. All the time we were waiting for the bus to complete our trip, I was thinking &quot;I will ALWAYS listen to the concierge from now on&quot;! The rest of the staff are just as helpful. When we left we discoverd our van battery was dead and the staff jumped through hoops to find jumper cables and a vehicle to get me on my way at 0430 in the AM. THEY ROCK!!!!!There are absoluty zero downsides to this hotel. You are a fool to stay any where else unless you have money to burn.bob"
145,258,"Jul 11 2006	Excellent value couldn't have been more pleased	I took my chances with a priceline 3star search in the Grant Park area and ended up here for $140. Couldn't have been happier since it was a &quot;Taste of Chicago&quot; weekend and every price I saw on the web was $200+ for a hotel within walking distance to Grant Park.The 12 foot ceilings are great (you just don't see that anymore, thank goodness for old architecture). The room was very comfortable with a nice and very large bathroom. Free internet access was also a plus. Staff was extremely helpful, no problems whatsoever. I asked for a room away from the train tracks and was given a room on the 5th floor...I could barely hear the train go by, it wasn't a problem at all...but it's right outside the front door of the hotel if you need it! I read some poor reviews of Ada's (Deli adjacent to the hotel) but my family had breakfast there on Sunday morning and loved it. I used the valet parking and didn't have a problem with that either (it's expensive but you'll find that anywhere in the heart of the city).I would recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to be close to all the action in the Millennium/Grant Park area. We even walked to Navy Pier from this hotel but it was a bit of a hike. You don't pay top dollar at Crowne Plaza Silversmith but you definitely get the quality of a 3-4 star hotel."
146,258,"Jun 16 2006	Labor Day Rocked at Wrigley! Thanks Silversmith!	We stayed at the Silversmith last Sept. (Labor Day) Checkin was fast, courteous and we were able to checkin early, this was great considering we just got off a long flight. The hotel Staff was very friendly and helpful, whenever we had a question about directions, they were more than happy to give us detailed directions and at times point it out.After we checked in, we found out Jimmy Buffet was in concert at Wrigley Field on Labor Day(also my Birthday) The tickets were sold out! We asked the conceigre if there was anyway she could find some tickets, she made a call got us great seats, cheaper than the face value of the tickets. I have always been a big Buffet Fan! Not only did I get to see Jimmy but on my birthday at Wrigley Field !! The concierge at Crowne Plaza Silversmith made it all happen!!The room was clean, quite, beds was very comfortable. Bathroom was very spacious and bright. Every morning we went and ate breakfast at &quot;Ada's Deli&quot; it was delicious, a big variety on the menu. Omelets are really good!This was my first visit to Chicago and it was beautiful! I hope to return again and stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith."
147,258,Jun 3 2006	No ComplaintsW	My husband and I stayed one night at the Crown Plaza Silversmith and purchased the &quot;Art of the City&quot; package through the Art Institute. We mapquested the route and had no problem finding the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the doorman to the front desk and consierge. We were very pleased with the room as well. It was absolutely spotless with a huge bathroom and lovely arts and crafts decor. We were on the 5th floor and the El was right below us but we agreed that we'd stayed in hotels with a/c units that were louder! It was not a factor at all and we slept great. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith.
148,258,"Jun 1 2006	Beautiful Room Home Away from Home	My husband and I LOVED our stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith over the Memorial Day holiday. We stayed two nights and paid $161/night + tax + valet, through a discount broker in Chicago. The hotel was a little hard to find at first - our online map showed that the hotel was on the east side of Wabash, but it's on the west side. Heading south on Wabash, look to the right for flags between Madison and Monroe. I thought the location was great, if you want to stay in the Loop/Theatre District/Grant Park area (and just a 5 minute CTA ride to River North). A taxi ride from Navy Pier cost about $8. The neighborhood is great, not seedy, as it's in the North Loop area, but it does feels more &quot;downtown&quot; than Michigan Ave's &quot;uptown&quot;. When we got in, the front desk staff asked us if we'd stayed with them before, and as we hadn't, they upgraded us to a Suite (retails at $529/night). Absolutely beautiful room. We had asked for a high floor because of the El running parallel with Wabash at about 2nd/3rd floors. We still heard the El at night, but not too bad, sort of like a whooshing noise. The bed was doublesheeted and we had white robes to wear. The two TVs, ethernet connection and refridgerator were excellent amenities and the bed was super comfortable. Our tall windows let in a lot of light and had a window seat too. The view was of another building though. We ordered room service for lunch one day, and although many reviews thought the attached restaurant Ada's Deli was bad, the pastrami sandwich we ordered was fabulous. The gal who answered the room service phone wasn't very pleasant though. Also, our valet took coins from our car - they tell you to remove valuables but I guess that translates to &quot;or else&quot;. It was only 90 cents, but it put a damper on our experience. Everything else about our trip was dandy though and we feel like the hotel is our home away from home in Chicago - especially if we can get that rate again."
149,258,"May 29 2006 	adequate but poor location	We stayed for two nights on a last minute trip. While the cost seemed comparable to Michigan Ave, the location leaves a bit to be desired. This hotel has an entrance below the elevated train, and really appears to be a nicely converted office building. We actually thought the GPS on our rental car was wrong and drove by the entrance twice before finding it. The neighborhood was a bit seedy, but we were able to find a nice Italian resturant a few block away (Tratttoria 10). The rooms are very nice, unique, and not at all like a generic chain. There are NO views.The staff are nice.They've done a nice job with what they've had to work with, but due to the location, we would not choose to stay here again."
150,258,"May 11 2006 	A great find	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith while in town for business and pleasure. This was one of the top Crowne Plaza hotels I have stayed at. The rooms were nicely decorated with oak trim, oak beds, and oak wardrobe/entertainment center. I had a King premium room, which was nice sized for downtown standards. The location was good - about 1/2 mile from Michigan/Chicago River and a block from Millenium/Grant Park. The L stops right outside and it is fairly convenient to the McCormick Place. Most of the good dining is North of the river, so a 1.5 mile walk or short cab ride will get you there quickly. I have stayed at the Palmer House, Hotel 71, Grand Hyatt, and some of the other 3* hotels in the area. This was far superior to those in my opinion."
151,258,"May 10 2006	Enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith	Our experience at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith was very good. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Millennium Park and we thought our museum package was a good value (the room, free breakfast next door at Ada's Deli, and tickets to the museum). The room was spotless, the bathroom was large and elegant, and the mattress was very good. We were worried about noise from the El, but with the fan running, we slept right through it. Some of the ground floor staff are not very friendly, but most were great. The only disadvantage is the difficult parking in front of the hotel to unload, requiring several trips around the block until we could doublepark."
152,258,"May 8 2006	Enjoyed this hotel!	Stayed at this hotel for a birthday weekend of theatre and shopping. We were very pleased. The staff from valet to desk to housekeeping was friendly and helpful. Peggy, the concierge, was excellent and had wonderful recommendations. The room was very nice with the high ceilings and very large bathroom. We did not hear the train hardly at all. As others have noted, the deli downstairs isn't the best food, but staff was pretty good. This would be one of my first choices next time we stay downtown."
153,258,"Apr 27 2006	Cozy and Good Value	As expected, the taxi driver from ORD didnt know where this hotel is located so be sure to have the street address at hand. Staff at the second floor lobby was friendly and helpful. We had booked a suite on the executive floor. Suite 1005 has the best view of the lake, but the view is across some black roofs and I wouldnt fight for it. The noise from the train below was not disturbing at all but the refrigerator was far too loud for the poor guy (me) who had to sleep on the sofa bed. The rest of the room was very nice and practical. There was even a microwave and a sink  very useful for preparing baby food.Our suite was not very large, in fact it was rather cramped when the sofa bed was in use. Also, there is no window in the living room and no door between bedroom and living room. But there are two TV sets.Continental breakfast at the club lounge was ok. There are only two cocktail tables and eight chairs in the lounge although we were always lucky with space.While both the suite and the executive lounge were nothing to write home about, it must be added that the surcharges for suite and executive were minimal. So at the end, it was a great value for a family of four. A very comfortable place and a perfect location."
154,258,Apr 11 2006 	Beware on ground floor	Beware of pickpockets in the lobby and front of the hotel..The Hotel Lobby is not on the Ground Floor and you enter into a smallish entrance. I have stayed here before but this was a red flag for us not to return.Hotel management were told of the problem but seemed to be annoyed with us not the pickpockets.
155,258,Feb 27 2006	Exceeded expectations	Great convenient location. Helpful staff. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Ada's restaurant/deli/bar connected on the ground level was good with pleasant staff.
156,258,"Jan 12 2006	Great Hotel	We stayed with our 2 children for a weekend in December. It has a perfect location to visit Millenium Park, the museums, &amp; the holiday decor at Daley Plaza &amp; Marshall Fields. We arrived &amp; were upgraded to a club level room. (only complaint, not much room for all of the guests to sit in the continental breakfast area) The beds were comfortable &amp; the bathroom was huge for a city hotel. We only heard the swoosh of the L while awake, no one noticed it at night. Ada's was convenient for an evening cocktail or breakfast in the morning. We would definitely stay here again."
157,258,"Nov 16 2005	Good value in the Loop	3-night stay over Veteran's Day weekend. Got a 10th floor executive room with breakfast coupons for Ada's next door, average price $229 a night (Thurs-Sun.) Ada's food is lousy, we ate there the second morning because the continental breakfast offered to 10th floor guests was in a small, uncomfortable room with a TV blasting. (Another disappointment: I assume an &quot;executive lounge&quot; would be available evenings and whatnot - it's not, only open for breakfast.)The desk staff was borderline rude when we arrived an hour before official check-in time, and had us trudge back downstairs with our suitcases to give them to the bellman. Our terrible first impression was fortunately mollified by the quality of the room once we were allowed in. The construction is solid; we never heard a sound from either occupied room next to us. These are not rooms for families, but they're perfect for a couple. Location is good, with easy access to subway, El and buses. Millenium Park and Art Institute are only a couple blocks away."
158,258,"Nov 7 2005	Great Room Close to Theater and shopping	This hotel was one of the more reasonably priced ones in the area around the theater district. The hotel is one block from Michigan Ave. and only a couple blocks from the theaters! Our room was ready when we asked to check in early. Our room was gorgeous. The beds were comfortable and I love all of the products that they offer in order for you to get a good night's sleep! The bathroom was HUGE!! I loved it! The shower head was disappointing. It was one of those massage ones set on a horrible setting and I couldn't reach to fix it. Housekeeping came and asked if we wanted turn down service. We could hear the train, of course, but it was not that bad. The desk clerk who checked us in was not exactly friendly but she wasn't rude either. She got the job done quickly and efficiently. The concierge did not seem friendly but we did not actually talk to her so I can't say for sure. Most of the bellhops/valets were very friendly and they are the first people you encounter when entering the building. We will definitely stay again!!!"
159,258,"Nov 5 2005	I couldn't have asked for more...	My sister recently came to visit from England for a visit. I chose the Silversmith because of the great reviews on this site!A few days before our stay I called Peggy the concierge and made a few requests. As it was my sister's birthday I wanted the stay to be memorable. When we arrived at the hotel our suite was ready! Not only were all of my requests met, but there was a bottle of white wine chilling with a birthday card for my sister! I couldn't have asked for better service! All of the staff and ammenities were perfect.My only complaints:1. I called the hotel before booking online because I wanted a two room suite (one bedroom with a sleeper sofa behind the french doors.) Upon checking in I found we only had a one room suite. This was a bit of an upset as we had three people sharing the room and wanted a little bit of privacy. However, it was nice anyway.2. We had breakfast at Ada's next door. The coffee was weak, the hashbrowns were cold and they didn't care. My main portion on breakfast, the Beneditct Arnold was perfect, but I'll never visit again. There's a 'Corner Bakery' one block south next to the Palmer House Hilton. Go there for breakfast, save yourself $5.00 per person and be much happier!"
160,258,"Oct 27 2005 	I am down-grading my rating but still a nice place	This was my third stay here, and I'm a little disappointed about this last trip. First, prices have gone up significantly; it's still a fine &quot;value,&quot; but our &quot;suite&quot; was on par price-wise with a nice room at the Renassaince/Westin-types. When we landed at the airport, I called to ask the El Stop to detrain. I was calling on my cell. The woman who answered said, Yadda, yadda, &quot;I'm with a guest now, please hold.&quot; So I held. 5 minutes later, I hung up. I tried again, same thing. And I held. I called again later, as we were now getting closer to downtown and I was a little nervous. Same answer, so I shouted out &quot;I just have the quickest question,&quot; and she started arguing with me! You can tell I'm peeved about this. It's b/c service here used to be so wonderful, and there were always plenty of staff in the past. I had chalked it up to a single problem until I was at the desk later that day and the staff person did the same thing. I told her it was okay with me to attend to the caller, which she did (I have no idea if it was the same person).This was our first stay in a &quot;suite&quot; here. True, two rooms, which was our goal. However, and I guess this is in keeping with Prairie style, the wall between the two rooms is 3 feet shorter than the ceiling. This defeated the purpose of having a separate work space for me apart from my husband. Too loud.Gym is 3 aerobic machines. Not a big deal in nice weather, as you are a block from the walking areas, but that's 6 months of the year that are touch-and-go.Business Center is $5 to use (each time), and only one computer prints. If you stay on 10th floor with the breakfast room, the servers are TOTALLY stressed out on weekends (but they're sweet). Bagels weren't even bagels, stale bread in square bagel form. But the zucchini bread was awesome. Coffee very good.Location is still prime, prime, prime. And not nearly as expensive as the Palmer House.I had felt the pleasure of staying here was in part the service, and I found that lacking this time. Hopefully, it was just a passing phase."
161,258,"Oct 25 2005 	Nice Hotel - close to the el and the Sears Tower	I stayed here October 24th for one night. My room was not ready so I stored my luggage and went to my office building in the Sears Tower. I took a cab to the tower - it took about 5-10 minutes, but walked back (about 10-15 minutes).When you walk in you see the bell hop on the first floor and take the elevator up to the second floor lobby. The decor is fresh and appears to be recently renovated. Ceilings throughout the hotel are very high and leave you with a very &quot;open&quot; impression. My work travel agency had booked me a smoking room so I switched to a non-smoking, wheelchair accessible suite on the 4th floor. I also requested a room AWAY from the el - very important here. The suite was very large and had recently been remodeled. I did not hear the train at night and only heard &quot;whooshing&quot; sounds the next morning. The bathroom was huge with granite countertops. The fitness center is open 24 hours. It is small and has about 4 cardio machines and a Precor cable machine, but it was fine. There is a flat screen to entertain you while you exercise. I usually stay at the W on Adams St. but the rooms there were sold out. I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith again."
162,258,"Oct 13 2005 	Great!	Three night stay for a conference, cute room with a little nook with a desk area. The train was right below my window but I couldn't really hear it, the windows are double panes, just sounded like a woosh of wind now and again. A good experience all around, and the train is actually a great benefit, took it in from midway airport and the stop is directly outside the front door of the hotel. Bathroom was larger than most hotels, rooms were spotless."
163,258,"Oct 3 2005	Easy from the airport and close to the Park	Great for the money and very well situated to go to Millenium Park and to take the train from O'Hare. It's not as good to get to Miracle Mile and that area, but there are plenty of cabs. As compared to other hotels of its quality, it's far cheaper. The concierge was just great and got us on the Architectural Tour about 15 minutes before it left. She was amazing. The whole Chicago experience was a brilliant one."
164,258,"Sep 21 2005 	Still An Excellent Hotel for the Monay	We stayed here for 4 nights this month and were not disappointed during our second visit. Room was clean, well appointed and the staff was excellent. Restaurant was very good for breakfast, lunch and dinner (if you like a diner-type New York-deli style food -which we do). Crowne Plaza also now offers ear plugs, eye shades, lavender linen spray and a relaxation CD in the room so any EL noise is a moot point. Only complaint is there is no parking (not that I would normally rent a car in Chicago but I had to drive to Milwaukee for a day) and the valet parking available was expensive and inconvenient since they park the car several blocks away. I waited about a half hour for the car and I called ahead 10 minutes before. What a waste of time. Otherwise the staff is excellent and the room is definitely a good deal in a great location."
165,258,"Sep 16 2005	Watch out! This hotel double billed my credit card!	I booked this hotel through Orbitz. I Had a nice stay at the hotel but when I got home there was a little surprise when I got my credit card statement. This hotel had double billed my credit card! Orbitz billed me for the room and so did the hotel. So far I have not gotten a satisfactory response from this hotel or Orbitz. I have spent hours on the phone being put on hold, trying to get this issue resolved. Be careful!"
166,258,Sep 12 2005	good value	We stated at the silversmith on the executive 10th floor the noise from the el was no greater than normal road noise. The service was very good and the suite of a good size. compared to the hotels on michigan and in river north you definitely get a lot more for your money.
167,258,"Sep 5 2005	Friendly Staff!	The staff is what really sets this hotel apart from other downtown Chicago hotels. They are always cheerful and helpful. Our room on the 10th floor even had a minor lake view at no extra charge. Most hotels (i.e. The Drake) would charge extra for a sliver of lake view. Not here! The &quot;El&quot; train outside the front door just adds to the downtown Chicago experience. You can hear it in the room but it's not very loud at all. The area seems very safe as long as you use common sense. We recommend The Big Downtown restaurant one block south. Millenium Park was great! Many of the reviews say the same thing but I would like to comment on a few minor negatives for you: The wall dividing our suite into 2 rooms only went about 75% of the way up to the ceiling (for air circulation?!). Provides privacy but not sound insulation between the two t.v.s. Also the lack of a pool is a bummer if you have kids. The cable t.v. channel selection is poor also; not even the Disney channel! If a hotel doesn't have a pool for the kids at least have the Disney channel! There was no bedding for the sofa sleeper in our room. Usually it is found in one of the drawers, some hotels will even have the bed made up in the sofa when you flip it out!. Had to wait 20 minutes for it to be brought up. Our floor had a lounge with a continental breakfast which was just pastries and juice. Overall a GREAT hotel!"
168,258,"Aug 26 2005	Tremendous!	I came to Chicago with my mother for three days -- the sole purpose of our trip being a U2 concert. I chose this hotel primarily based upon this sites glowing reviews, and it's close proximity to the United Center. We were both incredibly pleased.As I'm lazy and did not want to drag luggage on the El, we opted for the airport shuttle service, which I believe was 30 dollars per person (the price varies slightly according to hotel, and since the silversmith is downtown, it was one of the more expensive stops). Although we arrived at the hotel three hours prior to check in (my genius self forgot to allow for the hour back time change), the staff promptly lead us to our room. About an hour after our arrival, we recieved a call from the concierge asking us if we were pleased with our room. We were in the back on the 4th floor. While we faced a brick wall, we didn't have any problems with noise from the El (although, as I live in Manhattan, I can pretty much sleep through anything). The rooms were spacious (high ceilings were a nice touch), and I only wish I had that bathroom in my apartment. There was a good size desk in the room (good for business travelers), and free high speed internet (as my laptop is glued to my hip, this was a much appreciated amenity). We also recieved evening turndown service, even though we didn't request it, and the front desk was very prompt in replying to my request for feather pillows. We ordered room service for breakfast one morning, and as noted by another reviewer, their potato pancakces were excellent. The portions were also very large -- a little too large. The concierge also called up about five minutes after our food was delivered to ask us if we were pleased with our meal. Unfortunately, as we weren't there for long, we didn't have time to do much site seeing. We did walk to Millenium Park one night, which was quite lovely. I never felt unsafe walking around the surrounding area of the hotel -- as with any large city, just exercise common sense and stay alert. A bus to the United Center also stops diagonally across the street from the hotel.There was a young female concierge there who was definately on too many happy pills -- her ear to ear smile was just a little too eager to please. We did recieve a reccomendation for a pizza place from her (Giordano's -- not bad, but I'm still partial to NY pizza ;). It was also Mother's Day weekend, and they had some free desserts in the lobby for all Moms.I certainly hope to return to Chicago soon, and will most definately stay at the Silversmith. It was an absolute pleasure!"
169,258,"Aug 23 2005	Superb room location and service	I have stayed at numerous hotels in downtown Chicago: Essex, Palmer House, Almafi, Intercontinental, Club Quarters, Hyatt Regency, Best Western, Holiday Inn, Hotel 71, and a few others I can't recall. The Silversmith is in the top of the group in my opinion.A group of 8 of us arrived at 9:00am on a Friday morning and all were able to check-in to our 3 rooms that early. On top of that, we were each given an upgrade to a king suite at no extra charge. Another group came later and received a regular king room. The regular king room was spacious with high ceilings. The king suite I was in had 2 seperate rooms with high ceilings. The bed was comfortable. I was next to the L on the 6th floor. I could hear it, but it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake. Maid service was good. The bellman were very helpful with advice on blues clubs, bars, restaurants, and transportation. Friendly guys. There is a restaurant/bar downstairs open until 3am on the weekends. Good food (according to a few members of our group). A block south is a Corner Bakery with great breakfast. A block north is a Garretts popcorn for the best popcorn anywhere. Different L stations are very close enabling quick/easy travel nearly anywhere in the city.Only problem with the hotel occured when I came home and there was a charge on my card. It took a few calls before I found out I was charged for a robe. Took a few more calls to finally get the charge taken off. The robe had been thrown in with the dirty towels. Understandable mistake but became difficult to get the issue resolved. Although, it was resolved in the end and I thank the management for resolving the issue. Could happen at any hotel. I am really glad they took the charge off because I didn't want to have a reason to not go back to this great hotel in Chicago."
170,258,"Aug 7 2005 	The Best Value in Chicago!	This hotel is excellent! We only stayed one night at the Silversmith and then moved to the Four Seasons (that was on someone else's dime) for the next three nights...and, I liked the Silversmith better! It was $300 less per night too. The staff was so friendly, they let us check in early, held our bags for a few hours after we checked out, and made a fuss over our kids.The location is pefect. We walked to the museums and Millenium park. We also walked to the restaurant district, but that's not close, or you can take a cab for $6. Oh, we took the El from the airport (The El is $1.75 or a $45 taxi ride) and the stop is right at the door of the Silversmith, couldn't of been easier. You can hear the El sometimes (we were on the 10th floor) but after awhile you don't even notice.The breakfast had something for everyone, the room it was served in was just a little small. Silversmith also provided nice terry robes and turn down service. I highly recommend this hotel and we will stay here the next time we come."
171,258,"Aug 1 2005	way above and beyond	I have never bothered to post a review of a hotel before, but our recent stay (July 20-23) at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith was so wonderful I feel compelled to comment. We snagged a $168 a night on-line price from the hotel's website on the tenth floor executive level after reading reviews here about a higher level room being preferable because of the El outside. (We never heard a train once in our three days). The room came with the complimentary exec lounge breakfast but because we like to do the big breakfast thing when we travel, we tried downstairs at Ada's the first day (Good but too expensive $73 for four) and the second day, at Peggy the Concierge's recommendation, a good place down the block in a spiffy art deco building. Sorry can't remember the name but it was just a block north on the opposite side of the street. It had the feel that some young GI from WWII whistling a Glenn Miller tune with a few hours between trains to his next posting might just walk in to have a cup of joe and eggs and bacon. Perfect. The two great things about the service at the Silversmith:1) When our bags were brought up to our room our 11 yo son was complaining to me that he wanted jam with a croissant we brought from the airport. Well, I don't ordinarily travel with pots of jam and told him so. So he said to the bellman, &quot;Do you have any jam?&quot; I could have smacked him, but the guy said, &quot;Would you like grape or mixed berry?&quot; Huh?He whipped out the door, tipless, and returned with both varieties on a tray, with napkins, and a knife. Whoa!2) While we were working on dinner reservations, the aforementioned Peggy the Concierge found out that we were in Chicago for our 20th wedding anniversary (and to see the Red Sox play the White Sox). An hour or so later when my husband and I were down at the bar at Ada's, she sent up about a dozen warm cookies, two in-room movie passes for the our twin boys, and a card to the boys and a card to us.Yes, the room was small for four people. But it was nice and the bath was properly-sized. I don't expect a big room in an older city hotel. As others have stated in their reviews, they do give you ear plugs, but having stayed in the Crowne Plaza UN at 2nd and 42nd in New York many times for business, I know that the ear plugs and lavendar spray are a Crowne Plaza thing and not just because of the proximity to the El.The neighborhood felt completely safe for a family with kids day and night and we were able to walk just about anywhere we wanted to go. Public transport was close by to take us down to U.S. Cellular Field to see the game. Strangers were weirdly (we're from New England) and pleasantly friendly throughout our stay. The only exception was this Madame Mao chick who took control of the taxi line after the game with an iron fist. But she was probably from out of town too."
172,258,Aug 1 2005	Excellent stay at the silversmith	I stayed in a suite on the tenth floor. The room very quiet and spacious and the service was superb. The breakfast that came with the room was very good and the complementary cheesecake was delicious. The hotel is definitely as good as any four star hotel I have stayed in and I highly recommend it.
173,258,"Jul 9 2005	Hospitality makes the stay!	I have never stayed at a hotel where I have been treated so nicely, and where the staff is accomodating and genuinely interested in helping you and making sure that you have everything that you need. Form early checkin to directions to wherever we wanted to go, the staff was ready and able to assist. The hotel is very nice, clean, and located close enough to anywhere you want to go. The Chicago experience involves the train and walking through beautiful downtown, and the location of this hotel gives you a chance ot experience the city that way. There are an abundance of local, non-chain restaurants within walking distance so you won't go hungry! The hotel also has its own restaurant that serves a delicious breakfast."
174,258,"Jul 9 2005	Awesome experience	For visitors looking for an exciting offbeat vacation, the Silversmith is definitely the of the best hotel options in the city. If you are looking for cookie cutter rooms with bland furnishings, this is not the place for you. However, if you want to stay in the heart of the city, move with the people who live in this great city, this hotel offers a wonderful location and great staff. Several points to some of the other reviews:1) This isn't a Mich Ave hotel. It's in the business district and as such, isn't as touristy a location. However, you get a wonderfully restored, historic building designed by one of the city's master architects. The furnishings are nice and clean and very relaxing. 2) Yes, the el is right in front of the hotel. As in, you can stand on the L platform and see the entryway to the hotel. But this isn't a problem, if you want to go anywhere in the city. It's a great attribute for those people who don't need taxis to get around an urban setting.3) Noise...we stayed on the 8th floor in the back of the building. Despite some noise the first night, no earplugs were needed. The beds are very comfy and the bathrooms are something I could only wish I had at home. The hotel was VERY quite in general, though you can hear the slight noise of the urban setting. 4)This is NOT a bad part of town. I was with two other females and we walked everywhere at all times of the day and night. It's not as glitzy or busy as Michigan Ave, but you certainly don't need to freak out about walking down the street to go to a club or for dinner. Yes, there are a couple of people who work the lobby on the first floor/street level. But they are working, not bouncing the street in front of the building. They are getting luggage, helping customers and generally doing things that people pay huge bucks for in expensive hotels. I never once thought they were guarding the lobby.5) Early check in--- We arrived in the city via the L at 10am. We were helped inside (the doormen could hear us clanking down the steps of the El with our suitcases and were quick to help out). The doorman were excellent, offering a lot of advice for us since we were going to see the &quot;Cubbies&quot;. The receptionist not only gave us an early check in (we'd asked for a place to store our luggage for the game)...but gave us a great room. In fact, I've never been in such a flexible hotel before. They definitely epitomize the word &quot;accomodating&quot;. The staff in this hotel is unreal. When we left, the awesome doorman (one who carried two of our suitcases UP the L stairway when we voiced concerns about them being too heavy) always greeted us and offered umbrellas and advice without hesitation. The concierge was very helpful and so cheerful it was almost like being at cheer camp. But everyone in this hotel was awesome, friendly and helpful. I had a nice time just talking to them about the city and local places to visit/see. In comparison, we were sent to the poshest hotel on Mich Ave to get L passes from their gift shop. After waiting 20 minutes or longer in line at their conceirge desk (just to ask where the gift shop was)...we realized that spending more money on a hotel doesn't mean better service. If I had paid that much for a room and had to wait that long for someone to help me, I'd be mad. You will never wait more than a couple of minutes for anything at this hotel. Overall, this was a great trip. We looked forward to coming back to the room and resting between site seeing. And it's location to the lake front, shopping and museums means that you can go for short trips and the hotel is always just a few blocks away. If you have small children who need naps or just want to dump your shopping and go back out, this is the place to stay.We ate breakfast at Ada's several times. The meals were good and fairly priced, even if the staff seemed less than outgoing at times. But if you are looking for a quick start to the day with a wide option of meals, this is a good place to start.I have to say that I will probably never stay in another hotel while in Chicago. The quirkiness of this place is endearing. And trust me when I say that the best way to wind down from an exciting day is sitting in the lobby at night, munching on cheesecake, sipping the variety of coffees/teas and chatting with fellow guests. An excellent touch with great lighting, a soothing piano and really, a relaxing end to the day.I am a picky traveller and a picky sleeper. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. You can't do much better than this hotel. Trust the ratings and stay here. It was a wonderful urban experience."
175,258,"Jul 7 2005	Location Location Location (and a great place too)	We chose the Crowne Plaza Silversmith for 2 main reasons:1) Location: within blocks from Millennium Park, Grant Park, Art Mus., etc. Since the weather was so nice we walked everywhere - Navy Pier, Water Tower, Sears Tower, Aquarium/Field Museum, Theater, etc. Marshall Fields is just blocks away as well as the Red Line subway/EL that takes you to Wrigley Field. EL is right out front that we did use a couple times since so convenient.2) Style: Arts &amp; Craft/Mission style throughout the hotel. Great touches throughout lobby, halls, and into rooms. Bathroom very large w/ marble floors &amp; counters. We had 2 room mini-suite with parlor with separate TV, desk, coffee table and sofa. 12 ft. high ceilings gives added appearance of spaciousness. Our huge windows even had a little view of Lake Michigan. So nice to see the sailboats and tour boats on the water.We tossed around the idea of staying closer to the Magnificent Mile area, but we are glad we didn't. It was nice to be in the heart of downtown, yet so close to the lake front and the parks. The Silversmith is a quaint, historic hotel with top notch staff. We always enjoyed being greeted by the bellmen &amp; doormen whether we were coming or going. We'd definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay here on our next trip to Chicago."
176,258,"Jul 3 2005	Poor location service and facilities	This hotel was located in the downtown core but a long walk or train ride to the main restaurants and attractions on the North side. Service was below par, no flexibility of early checkin or late checkout. Limited lobby bar service offered with poor atmosphere and few drink selections.Lower floor rooms noisy due to proximity of the El train.Rooms clean and well decorated.Attached restaurant Ada's deli does good breakfast, didn't try evening meal. Miller's Bar is a short walk away and does an excellent evening meal (great ribs) for a reasonable price."
177,258,"Jun 29 2005 	One of the best Chicago hotels!	Just stayed three nights at this fine, beautifully appointed hotel. Small suite on the 10th floor, wonderful furnishings, nicely served continental breakfast just down the hall. It is a small and perfectly situated hotel in the Loop area, walking distance to the Art Instititute, the new Millennium Park, and much more. It was a safe and busy neighborhood even until midnight, shopping, decent restaurants and theaters nearby.  A lovely lobby and small but excellent fitness center just off the lobby (clean and comfortable, windows out on to the street, treadmills, elliptical trainer and universal wieght machine and more.) Super friendly staff, too. I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Chicago, and this is definitely one of my favorites, for families or business, whatever."
178,258,"Jun 19 2005	Truly wonderful	We paid extra for an executive room on the 10th floor. Our room was large with king size bed, lovely addition of a turn-down maid service each night with chocolates left on our pillows. Room was also supplied with earplugs, nightmask, lavendar spray and relaxation CD but only one kit - not that this was a problem. There was two bathrobes provided in the bathroom.We paid the additional rate for the room as included in the rate was continential breakfast - pastries, bagels, cereals, juices, tea/coffee which was supplied on our floor in a small meeting room.We could not see the L train from our room, as we were facing the back so did not have much of a view at all but at the same time we were not bothered by noise.The hotel is within walking distance of the main attractions of Chicago (well we walked to them!) and although not a particularly pleasant sight returning to the hotel at night-time but if you walk a block east, you come out by Grant Park which is wonderful and you do not feel like you are in the same city.We did not use any of the other facilities at the hotel nor did we get chance to sample the free cheesecake (but would have loved to) as we were still out at the time (and it is only served mon-thurs).Would highly recommend this hotel to everyone."
179,258,"Jun 9 2005	Wonderful Hotel!	This hotel has recently been completely refurbished, rooms were very new looking and very clean. Beautiful rooms. The views stink, but the noise level was very minimal. I heard more traffic noise when staying at the Radisson last year on a higher floor. Request a room on one of the upper floors. We were on 7, and heard the &quot;L&quot; swoosh by but it wasn't a problem at all. No earplugs were needed. The staff was friendly and very accomadating, especially the door/bell men. Ada's restuarant next door is very reasonably priced. The only complaint was the slow elevators and that is not much to complain about. Oh and no cheesecake on the weekends.....bummer! But overall for the price we paid on the Crowne Plaza website, this was one of the more affordable rooms in the city in June, and we were very satisfied!"
180,258,"May 24 2005 	Holiday Inn Plus	The bottom line is that this is a Holiday Inn. A little nicer furnishings but basically a Holiday Inn. The biggest issue I have with the hotel is the location. It's right on Wabash and the &quot;L&quot; runs 20 feet away every 3-5 minutes. We had a room in the back which I requested and the &quot;whooshing&quot; sound went on forever. The noise is an annoyance, but not a prohibitive issue. Staff tries hard. All but one young man who works on Sundays and has an attitude. Management probably knows who he is. I won't give his name, but he's slight of build. Couple we were travelling with had a problem with a distinctly moldy smell in the room. They were finally moved, but it took a lot more arguing than it should have. And this was dealing with the manager, not my arrogant friend. Room rates seem to be all over the board on this place. Weekend rates can be reasonable or outrageous. We stayed for three nights. We had three rates and the highest rate was twice the lowest. And you don't get a lot of warm fuzzies walking on Wabash after dark. The hotel insists there's no problems, but they sure have plenty of security in the ground floor entry. In terms of hotel preference, the Silversmith ranks in about the middle of the pack of Chicago hotels."
181,258,"Apr 28 2005	Loved it!!	My husband &amp; I visited the Crowne Plaza Silversmith 4/20-4/23 and enjoyed ourselves immensely! We had researched a few options ahead of time and after reading previous Trip Advisor Reviews, decided on the CPS and were not disappointed... The reviews are not too good to be true... it's all factual. I'll breakdown as I can.Location - a block off of Michigan....so conveniently located near the Art Institute &amp; a short cab ride from the Field Museum. In fact, if the weather hadn't been too cold, it would have been just fine to walk, too. Marshall Fields is just a block away.....that building is fantastic (it was not on my husband's &quot;have to see&quot; list but, after doing so, was appreciative since it is a spectacular building with interesting architecture.)Service - EXCELLENT!!! We were assisted with our bags the minute our cab dropped us off and escorted to the lobby area to check in (which just took minutes.) I did need just a few more hangers (but, that is because I over packed) and they were brought up within minutes. The concierge was wonderful. We visited in great length dinner options and she was very helpful with our sight-seeing discussion. The doormen were always most courteous and eager to &quot;fetch a cab&quot; for us, if need be. Service was just wonderful! The Suites - FABULOUS!! We did request a suite above the 5th floor - on the opposite side of the EL. I usually have a difficult time sleeping the first evening in a different location and had NO troubles catching a cat nap and falling into a wonderfully peaceful sleep my first night. The suites were very spacious and with the suite layout, allowed me to catch a few winks more than my &quot;up at the crack of dawn&quot; husband. I generally do not rave about bathrooms, but, these really were spectacular. The beautiful Granite countertops, spacious design with fluffy white robes to use...just wonderful! We enjoyed and appreciated the Relaxation CD.... we were supplied the Lavender linen spray and ear plugs but, neither were necessary. There is a slight &quot;swoosh&quot; noise from the El, but, it did not, in the least bit, cause disruption. The refrigerator was wonderful to store leftovers and bottled water..... The Lobby - LOVELY Mission style room. Not Grand in appearance (in comparison to a Palmer House for example) but, lovely. They had a cheesecake hour I believe at 9:00 M-TH, however, we were always out &amp; about at that time but, it is there for the guests. The fitness center (which we did not use) was adjacent to the lobby and easily accessible, if one so desired. Quiet, Relaxing &amp; Enjoyable area. As I said, previously, just Lovely! Restaurants - Nothing to share, here. We were travelling with others and we did not ever seem to make it to Ada's Deli/Restaurant. However, did make it over (1/2 block away) to the Corner Bakery Cafe for a sandwich a couple of times....what a wonderful lunch or breakfast menu. We went to Miller's Pub one evening for a quick bite....one can't eat heavy, rich foods, every night so.... and Miller's Pub was a fun setting with good burgers ( my husband had a hamburger &amp; I had a turkey burger) and it was exactly what the doctor ordered for us, that day. Trader Vic's was fabulous... a bit pricey but, very good. Now, if you get the opportunity to get over to Greek Town, please go to Costa's.....FABULOUS!!!!! Their menu was tremendous, the food was DELICIOUS, and setting was just FUN &amp; very ENJOYABLE!!Overall, just a fabulous experience at the CPS! We would definitely stay there again. Now, if we could have only brought wonderful weather with us, the trip would have been perfect!!"
182,258,"Mar 17 2005	Struck gold at the Silversmith	Wonderful room, service, location. I don't know how they perch a hotel right over the L tracks without noise problems, but that is the case. A helpful staff, easy going yet elegant atmosphere, and an overall great bargain. Very reasonable with a terrific concierge."
183,258,"Mar 16 2005 	Like a perfect dream.....	Like the others said, I had a bit of trouble finding the hotel, from the views from its website, it appears grand and elaborate, however, the entrance is simple and discreet. I called for directions and the front desk agent stayed on the phone with me and coached me in as I twisted through the city. I was a bit apprehensive about the experience until this moment when they actually spent 10 minutes with me helping me find the hotel. When I finally found the hotel I questioned myself because the entrance is an old drab hallway with 3 elevators. There was nothing else other than the cheery doorman who greeted me as I came in and directed me upstairs to check in. As the elevator opened, I saw the lobby - WOW - a hidden treasure! The room was spectacular - the view wasn't, just a birdseye view of the train, but the service made up for it and more! Remember these names - MICHAEL and PEGGY. These two are remarkable! When you go, you must meet these two people. The train noise is minimal and they give you earplugs and music to help subdue the sound. All in all, outstanding place!"
184,258,"Mar 9 2005 	Old a bit drab but great location and service	When I checked in, the staff could not be friendlier - they even have a reception at 9pm with FREE cheese cake, coffee and cookies. the rooms are large and they provide nice amenities, but the views are horrible. My room faced a brick wall and my friend's room faced the &quot;L&quot; which was noisy! They do provide earplugs, but if you are not used to sleeping with them you will not be happy.The location is good for business travelers. they gym stinks - an old stairmaster, bike and treadmill - not worth putting on my sneakers. Overall, if you can get a good rate and don't need much, go for it."
185,258,"Mar 3 2005	Gorgeous decor kind staff great location for theater	4 adults stayed in a room with 2 &quot;double&quot; beds in mid-January. The beds looked more like queen size. We also had a roll-away so we could spread out a little - no charge. What a pretty mission-style room. And the bathroom was unbelievable...so huge we set-up the ironing board in there for the duration. The room rate was around $120/night. Valet parking (the only option) is $28/day - which is unfortunate but normal for downtown Chicago. Breakfast was not included in our rate. Attended a show at the Shubert and chose this hotel for its proximity to the theater and its lower rates. In the bitter cold we were able to walk to the theater (even grandma!) Also walked to Trader Vic's for dinner and the younger folks walked to the Art Institute. (In better weather, anyone should be able to make the walk.) Walking distance to Marshall Field's - it's basically right next door. There is a restaurant/deli in the same building so you don't even have to go outside. The staff were all really kind and helpful. We felt like the only guests at the hotel. In fact, I didn't hear any noise for 3 days! All rooms have a fridge, CD player, relaxation CD's, linen spray and earplugs - a nice touch. The el-train noise was not noticable. Requested a room above the 5th floor on the recommendation of another reviewer. Good advice! Join the Priority Club to earn points toward a free stay at Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, Crowne Plaza hotels - it's free."
186,258,"Mar 3 2005	Quiet Friendly Great Location	After reading a number of reviews of downtown's &quot;budget&quot; hotels on tripadvisor, we decided to splurge a little and go for the Silversmith - and we were not disappointed! Not having stayed in Chicago before, we were pleasantly surprised at how very quiet this hotel is. We took the advice of other reviewers and requested a room away from the El train, and it was just an occasional, 5-second, distant &quot;whoosh&quot; sound. It's nothing compared to the experience of staying in a hotel with an in-room blower! We couldn't even hear sounds from the street - It was amazingly quiet for being right downtown. That downtown location was equidistant from everything we wanted to see &amp; do - It's just a couple blocks from the Art Institute, Millenium Park (note that the Cloud Gate is under construction until spring), and the absolutely wonderful Berghoff restaurant. The room itself was super clean, well-appointed, nice high ceilings/windows, big bathroom, and comfy bed with lots of pillows. The hotel staff were all very courteous and friendly - When we mentioned to the front desk attendant that we would be stopping at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry on our way out of town, he gave us a pair of free passes that he happened to have that day! We found the hotel &amp; the city very accessible, with a nice, hometown feel that you don't find in places like NYC. The attached restaurant, Ada's, was also very good and reasonably priced, with great service. Try the potato pancakes! Overall an excellent experience."
187,258,"Jan 26 2005	Great value great staff - outstanding!	We stayed at the Silversmith for 5 days last September, based largely on recommendations from other TripAdvisor users. We owe them a debt of gratitude! The Silversmith is a lovely, well-appointed hotel with great staff. It's decorated in a turn-of-the-20th century Arts and Crafts manner, rather more interesting than the bland &quot;corporate modern&quot; decor of many hotels. It's in a very convenient location - we were able to walk to many attractions - Grant Park, the lakefront, the Art Institute and Michigan Avenue are all within a short walk, as is State Street shopping. And the train stations are very close as well, meaning you can get anywhere (even O'Hare!) in good order, and cheaply. I think we took a cab once in five days.The staff is very helpful without being obsequious, happy to assist with any questions or needs you have. Perfect. The continental breakfast (incl. with our room) was wonderful, the evening dessert buffet was lovely, the bed was ultra-comfortable, the bathroom was *very* large, and...what else can I say? A+"
188,258,"Jan 25 2005	Comfortable quiet friendly. Lousy window view.	My husband and I stayed one night on Saturday Jan 22 and were very satisfied with the Silversmith. The personnel were fantastic - very friendly. The woman who staffed the little desk in front of the door went way out of her way when our taxi didn't arrive on time to take us to the airport. She actually went out in the snow on a COLD Sunday morning to grab us a taxi waiting at another hotel around the corner at 5AM. The rest of the staff was also very cordial. Our remote wasn't working properly, and they had a new one to us within a couple minutes of my call. The woman who brought it waited outside our door until I verified it worked and came back out to let her know. The doorman was all smiles and cheer too.The room was on the 8th floor (nice), but had a view of brick walls (what a shame). MOST importantly, it was VERY comfortable, and quiet. We didn't like the lavendar linen spray, but did play the relaxation CD which was nice. The fridge was handy for leftovers, though a microwave would have been nice for the late night snack.The location was great for us - a great middle stop for hiking to the sights we wanted to visit to both the north and south."
189,258,"Jan 25 2005	reviews are true	We went to Chicago the week of January 17th to visit family. I chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor. We were travelling with our 17 month old son and so it was very important to us to find a hotel that had suites and was also affordable. This hotel was perfect. The room was large and had a separate bedroom. It also had a refrigerator in the room which was very convenient. We asked for a room on the opposite side from the train and it was very quiet. Still had some train noise, but unless you are extremely sensitive to noise it was hardly noticeable. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable. We ended up staying an extra day and they gave us a reduced rate for the extra night. Only negative to this hotel is location. Because it was so cold we took a taxi everywhere we went. It is off the beaten track, but still close enough to walk if the weather is warmer. Most of our taxi fares were under $8.00. All in all a great hotel."
190,258,"Jan 8 2005	Great New Year's stay	My sister, nephew, &amp; I stayed at this hotel over New Year's Eve. We got a great rate for both the night before &amp; New Year's Eve by booking on Crowne Plaza's website in advance. The hotel is several blocks away from Shubert theatre where we had tickets to a show. The location is great. We drove in from the Detroit area and had a hard time finding the hotel. Look closely, because the only part of the hotel at street level is the front door. Once we found it we had a great stay. The front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant. The concierge, Peggy, was a delight. The room was big enough for the three of us, and we appreciated the relaxation CD since we were just above the train (on the 5th floor). Although you could hear it, the noise was not that loud. The room was very clean and well appointed. It had the largest safe I've ever had in a hotel. One note--if you plan to use the sofa bed, let them know when you check in. Although they had turndown service, they did not pull out the sofa bed for my nephew. When we pulled it out, we found it did not have linens on it. We called the front desk and they told us you need to inform them if you want to use the sofa bed. When we checked in they knew we were 2 adult women and one large 16 year old boy--I felt they should have known that we would not all fit in 1 king size bed. That was the only hiccup in a great stay. Oh, Ada's Deli in the hotel has the best potato chips if you like your chips well-done (not quite burnt). They make them there. Be sure to stock up."
191,258,"Jan 4 2005	Crown Plaza Silversmith a true gem!	What a great hotel for a downtown location. Marshall Fields is a block away! The service at this hotel was great! We had made modifications to our reservations and had no problems whatsoever! We had a suite on the 8th floor. Huge bathroom (with terry robes!). Pull-out couch for the son, and a wonderful king bed in a seperate room for mom and dad! Coffee maker, fridge, and turn-down service with mints! We highly recommend using the concierge. She had some great tips for us as well as having connections for quick seating at the Walnut Room (even during the holidays!).We requested a room opposite the train system - and it was very quiet. However, they provided a set of earplugs if needed, along with a CD to help you sleep.For a downtown location - we would definitely go back!"
192,258,"Jan 2 2005	A Vacation Highlight	This hotel was wonderful -- it became a highlight of our short vacation in Chicago. We had a suite on the 5th floor - with an interesting view of the El and Wabash Street. Yes, there is some noise from the El, but the windows are well insulated, and the suite contained earplugs, lavender linen spray, and a relaxation CD -- all of which helped us to forget the noise and just enjoy the room. Great location and wonderful service. Well recommended!"
193,258,Dec 29 2004 	Great Hotel	I stayed here a few months ago. Had to be in town on business short notice initially could only get into the SuisseHotel which was nice but extremely pricey. I managed to get into the Silversmith by virtue of being platinum with Priority Club. I was not upgraded as the hotel was extremely full at the time however I was given access to the club lounge for free breakfast etc if I wanted it (unfortunately was also working a wierd hours shift and don't think I ever at a breakfast while in town). The doormen are all extremely friendly helping with getting your bags from cabs and saying hi and it seems like they mean it as well when you walk in and out of the hotel. The front desk manager was extremely nice and very accomodating with any requests that I had. They even went as far as letting me use their office PC's when I could not get their business center PC's to print out my boarding pass. The restaurant downstairs is nothing spectacular just good normal American type food (I personally liked it as I like being able to get something that looks regular when I'm in a rush). The room was not very large however the hotel is an old remodeled building that has these 12' ceilings so it gives the impression that the room is huge regardless of the square footage. I plan on staying there again if sent to the Windy City for business and hope to take my wife there someday if we go on vacation to Chicago.
194,258,"Nov 28 2004	What a GREAT Hotel 	I initially made our Chicago reservations at the Hotel Allegro, but after reading all the negative reviews regarding noise level between rooms, I made reservations with the Chicago Silversmith. We visited Chicago Nov 20-25 for vacation. The reviews were right on the mark -- this place is a FANTASTIC find!! I called prior to our arrival and asked for a room on the fifth floor or higher -- due to the noise level of the El train. When we arrived at 10:00 am, we were given a suite on the 10th floor, Club Level. Our suite was huge with wonderful big windows and mission style furniture (our favorite). This is a perfect hotel for families. There were three of us. Mom &amp; Dad in the bedroom and child in the living room (queen sleeper sofa). The bathroom was also huge. Our $153 rate included continental breakfast that was located a couple doors down from our room. It was staffed by a Silversmith employee. She prepared our coffee and any items we wanted heated or toasted. We also had the opportunity to use the Concierge (Peggy) several times. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. The entire hotel staff was top notch. The location of this hotel is perfect. There are plenty of great places to eat (the Berghoff is one of our favorites) and lots of museums and shopping. The Art Institute is just a couple of blocks away. We also walked to the Field Museum and to the north end of Michigan Ave to the John Hancock Building. We rode the El (right outside our door) to visit Oak Park -- home of Frank Lloyd Wright. We will definitely recommend the Silversmith to our friends and hope to stay again in the near future."
195,258,"Nov 17 2004 	I just pray they don't jack up their rates like everyone else!!!	This hotel is, in a word, superb. As a party of four, we rented a King Suite, which is a king size bed plus a fold-out queen size couch bed. My wife and I slept on the latter and it was very comfortable--no bar in the back syndrome. The couple who got the bed raved at its comfort. The bathroom was huge, and the shower terrific. Even though our room faced Wabash and thus the train, while it could be heard going by the windows were insulated well enough that it wasn't too much of a disturbance. The style and cleanliness of the hotel were excellent. The service and staff were wonderful. Also, the hotel doesn't nickel and dime you to death for every amenity you desire. I will definitely stay here every time I go to Chicago unless they, like every other great place I find, start jacking up their rates. Our suite was $136 + tax per night, and we were 100% satisfied. Please keep rates reasonable and we will keep coming back!!!"
196,258,"Nov 16 2004	A Wonderful Place to Stay	We just had a great weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Silversmith for three nights. My first clue this would be a restful retreat was the understated entrance to the hotel. Simply a door off Wabash Ave. that leads to the elevators for the hotel located in one of Chicago's historic buildings. The room was beautiful, muted colors, very comfortable bed and sofa. A huge bathroom with separate tub and shower. Incredible tall thin windows with not much of a view but...Perfect Perfect Perfect. Yes, we could hear the trains going by but we just pretended it was the North Wind.The location was excellent for what we had in mind. Close to Trader Vic's at the Palmer House, Millenium Park, the Art Institute, Marshall Fields window displays, shopping, food. We walked everywhere we needed to go. Never felt the need to take the train. Paid $28 per night for valet parking and well worth it to us. Just knowing we could have the car whenever we wanted was great...even though we never needed it.Walked to Sears Tower, walked to John Hancock, all from this centrally located hotel.Plus there is an excellent deli located on the bottom floor where the Rueben's are to die for.Give this hotel a shot and you will be assured of stress-free stay."
197,258,"Nov 2 2004	Good value for the $	Very nice, clean hotel that must have been recently renovated. Great location, exception for being right next to the L train (very loud). That's the biggest negative. Other than that, excellent service. Paid $171/night for a suite on the concierge level. Well worth the money."
198,258,"Nov 2 2004	Once again-A1 Service!!	I stayed at the Crowne Plaza-Silversmith a year ago and had excellent service that I decided to take my girlfriend with me this past weekend. My girlfriends absolutely loved it!! The staff was very professional and helpful. Our rooms where very clean and roomy. Many hotels in Chicago have very small rooms but ours where a good size. The front desk was very friendly. It is located by all of the major shopping stores, so we walked instead of being bother with traffic. I have nothing bad to say about Crowne Plaza-Silversmith. This is the only place I will stay!!"
199,258,"Oct 20 2004	a gem under the el tracks	The Silversmith is quite the find. It's a small, boutique-ish hotel in the loop, right next to the Madison El station and a little over a block from the grand old Marshall Field's store.The lobby is small and elegant, decorated in traditional furniture. The traditional look continues in the rooms, which are large with huge TVs in armoires, CD player-clocks and other niceties. The bathrooms are also big, with plenty of fluffy towels.But it's the service that really sets this place apart. The doormen are the absolute best, greeting you every time you enter and literally breaking their necks to help you with bags. Also, there's turn down service, a little sleeping aid bag with an eyemask and CD, and even a call from the front desk after you've checked in.The Loop location isn't the most lively on nights and weekends, but the Silversmith is in a great spot. You can literally walk out the front door and up the stairs of the El station (Brown, Green, Purple and Orange lines). The red line is a block away on State Street, and another block over is the Blue Line to O'Hare. The hotel is also within easy walking distance of Millenium Park and the museums, or even the Mag Mile on a decent day. (Save the shoe leather and take the red line up to Chicago for the Mag Mile tho).With rates that haven't gone bonzo like many Chicago hotels, the Silversmith is a jewel. I can't say enough good things about this place!"
200,258,"Oct 3 2004	Crowne Plaza Silversmith - Great Price Great Place	After weeks of searching for the best hotel to stay at in Chicago along with the best price I followed the advice of other reviews from Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed at all. The Crowne Plaza Silversmith was a wonderful place to stay. Not only was the location convienient to many Chicago attractions, the staff was outstanding. My family and I were treated like royalty. The hotel staff were professional, personable and are willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay comfortable. The hotel is immaculate, everything was clean and in perfect condition from the lobby to the hotel rooms. The decor is tastefully done and well maintained. We had a suite and it was very roomy and comfortable, we felt at home in this room. The beds and bedding are very plush and cozy. They even provide you with a music CD to help you sleep. The bathroom was very nice and large. Best of all the price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. The one and only complaint I have is that the hotel is located next to the Loop and depending where your room is located you can hear a faint sound of the train. I followed other travelers suggestions and requested a room on an upper floor not facing the loop and it was fine. Also, we took the blue line train from the airport for $1.75 each and it stopped about 2 blocks from the hotel which saved us about $50.00 in cab fare. All our luggage has wheels so it wasn't a problem walking from the train station. I felt we got a great value, outstanding service and a perfect location convienient to shopping, restaurants and attractions. I highly recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed!"
201,258,"Sep 11 2004	Great Service/Great Hotel	We just returned from a four night stay at the Silversmith, which I booked largely based on recommendations from TripAdvisor users. We were very impressed. The hotel had a lovely lobby and great rooms: large(!), clean, with stylish/comfortable furnishings, and roomy window seats and sills (which the kids loved). The staff was super friendly and accomodating. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the new Millennium Park, which was a big hit! A longer but nice walk from the hotel to the museum campus and a quick cab ride to other sites, like Lincoln Park Zoo and MOSI. For a family, the location was great: right near a CVS pharmacy, a Corner Bakery cafe, and a White Hen convenience store. It's also right next to the El (or the flying train, according to my daughter), but there was no real noise. Security was nice, too--you need a room key to access all floors but the lobby. I would definitely recommend the Silversmith."
202,258,"Aug 30 2004	A wonderful place for families	Just returned from a comfortable stay at the Crowne Plaza Silversmith. The location was exceptionally convenient, the staff was attentive and friendly, and the room was spotless. The blue line from O'Hare is 2 blocks away, all other lines are either out the front door or 1 black away, and there's a free green trolley(to the Aquarium) stop about 2 blocks away. Our executive floor room well-suited our family's needs with a large granite bathroom, a small breakfast buffet, and a refrigerator. In the lounge, available to all guests is a basket of apples and oranges, morning coffee, and on Monday-Thurs. there is evening dessert. The decor is tasteful and understated. Our only complaint was that our room faced a tall brick wall, so that we had no view, and the natural lighting was limited. But really, we weren't in the room much, so it wasn't a big deal. We would definitely stay there again."
203,258,"Aug 14 2004 	Great hotel great location	I had a good experience in August at The Crowne Plaza Silversmith. I got a deal through their website and a further discounted rate on the weekend for the concierge floor. The only real extra, besides needing your key card to access the floor, is a free breakfast buffet of the usual pastries, cereal, yogurt, fruit and coffee served on the floor. There is a micro and toaster you can use during breakfast in the floors lounge. High speed wired internet also.The hotel is right in front of the &quot;L&quot; subway trains, which are noisy and run regularly. Thankfully the hotel has excellent windows that do a good job of muting almost all the sound. The hotel is done in a mission style with lots of oak and architectural accents. Perfect if you're on a Frank Lloyd Wright-themed trip.The rooms are high-ceilinged and large with big windows. The site said the last renovation was in 1998, but it has held up well. The only blemish was an older shower head that wasn't as powerful as I would have liked.Location is excellent - one block from Grant park, the bandshell, Art Institute, Marshall Fields and other shopping. Also within 2 blocks of the L trains for Midway and O'Hare airports. The deli/restaurant downstairs is open late, has a wide variety of food from premium hotdogs to giant sandwiches to steak. The desserts and their own root beer are excellent.All in all a great hotel - worth the money."
204,258,"Jul 27 2004 	Great stay	We had a wonderful time at this hotel. The staff was pleasant and the concierge was so very helpful in finding restaurants that really gave us a feel for Chicago's cuisine. The hotel had nightly turn down service and every staffmember we saw in the halls or anywhere in the hotel, greeted us and welcomed us back when we returned for the night. It's in the Loop district and within walking distance to the parks, art museum, Buckingham Fountain and shopping as well. Very clean."

2,260,"Nov 23 2009 	a perfectly located small hotel with good size rooms well appointed and a superior concierge named stephanie	talbott has everything one could want: clean, bright large room and a location about two minutes walk from michigan avenue; EVERY staff member was smiling, attentive and knowledgeable but stephanie the concierge started helping with the planning a few months before our arrival and never stopped being helpful (this trip was to celebrate my wife's 70th birthday). Stephanie arranged symphony tickets, jazz club entree, restaurant reservations, and provided information about the art institute, walking tours, etc."
3,260,"Nov 22 2009 	Comfy Home Base Near Shopping	We stayed at the Talbott for two nights in November 2009. It was a great home base for exploring downtown Chicago, just a block from the shops on Michigan Avenue and a short cab ride to the Art Institute and Navy Pier.Our room was on the smallish side but comfortable and clean. My only complaint was the bed linens, which consisted of a duvet and decorative throw (no top sheet). I prefer a bit more weight/substance, and even at 5'4&quot; I had to choose whether to cover my shoulders or my feet.One tip: Skip the continental breakfast. It's a European-style spread and features only yogurt, bread, cereal, sliced meats and sliced cheeses."
4,260,"Nov 20 2009 	The Talbott was great!	We chose the Talbott for a family weekend in Chicago and it was perfect. The location was wonderful, just a block and a half from Michigan Ave., very close to shopping and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions and reservations. The rooms were very large and well-appointed. We shopped at nearby Sur la Table, Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Bloomingdale's,and Water Tower Place. We had fun and good family dinners at the Big Bowl and Cheesecake Factory."
5,260,"Nov 15 2009 	Great Suite in Best Location	We have 2 young children so we stayed in a king one bedroom suite with adjoining standard room. This gave us two seperate bedrooms and a living room w/desk. Loved the rooms. Big, very nice furniture, great TV's, and very clean. Across the street is Starbucks. Grocery with good deli &amp; wine just around the corner and Walgreens 1 block north. Try Bar Luxe for breakfast. Food is great, it's two blocks north, and no wait. We are in Chicago every couple months. We've stayed at Embassy Suites (simple, rooms too small), Four Seasons (nice but no nicer than the Talbott for 1/2 the price), Hotel Monaco (also very nice). In the future, we'll be spending most visits at The Talbott."
6,260,Nov 15 2009 	Comfort and Location	Stayed for 5 nights in October to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday. Doormen and bell boys were excellent. Front desk staff a little aloof but professional. Room was very comfortable and immaculately kept by housekeeping. Agreed with other travelers comments about breakfast - why bother when it does nothing to enhance the stay and the &quot;elevator&quot; music in the cramped and badly lit breakfast room at 8am is just too much!! Just two little niggles - got a better rate 3 weeks before arrival than I did when I had booked 4 months prior. In addition they paid no attention to the comment that we were celebrating a special occasion. Some little extra touches would have steered me towards excellent rather than very good.
7,260,"Nov 13 2009 	Wonderful Hotel	My family and I stayed at the Talbott from 8/10/09-8/16/09, Room 510. The entire stay was great. We had a double queen room which was huge. I was concerned about room size since there was four of us in the room, but no problem what so ever. The staff was attentive and helpful. The location was great (you must go across the street for cupcakes at More - even better, just stand outside the place at night and smell the cupcakes baking). I would highly recommend this hotel."
8,260,"Nov 10 2009 	Wonderful experience	We first want to congratulate and thank their concierge staff. Before we even got there, Stephanie was a huge help. She treated us like gold and read our needs correctly. Very nice person. Gene also was helpful while we were there. The check in was terrific and the guy was very friendly and he upgraded us without us knowing. Did not realize it until we were in the room. The bellmen during check in and during our trip were very friendly and helpful. The Room was great. Well cleaned but when we had used some coffee mugs and glasses it took them a while to replace. There is a restuarant on premise called Bice Bistro. We got back from our restaurant on Saturday night at about eleven and the bar was closed. We were told Talbot was not a destination place. Seems like if they marketed that more, it would be another revenue stream, especially with all the new condos and apartments in the area. Now to the wourse part of the Talbot. That breakfast you get when you register on line is not worth it at all. Continetal breakfasts at Holiday Inn Express, Hilton Gardens etc are much better. In fact, if I were the Talbot I wouldn't do it. No fruit, cereal that was for kids, restocking for bowls for cereal, no bagels, just toast. We ate there one of three mornings and that was all we could take.We loved the Frette bedding and towels. Top notch. Aveda products were terrific also. . We loved the location. Kind of a quiet side street. Heard a lot from folks on this message board about construction. Yes it is going on but it is not the Talbot's fault. It isn't that bad anyhow. Their lobby is small but very quaint. Nice fireplaces to sit close to with a cocktail. Finally we had a temperature problem and hair dryer problem with our room and when we called, it was fixed right away.It was a great three days."
9,260,Nov 2 2009 	Bring an alarm clock	My girlfriend and I were there for a weekend at the end of October. The room was clean but you could see it had seen better days. The carpet was kind of....Since it was our first time in Chicago the concierge suggested a restaurant. It was obvious that the restaurant gave a kickback of somekind since we had to present a ticket given to us by the concierge.The biggest drawback for us was that on our last day we asked for a wake-up and never got it. A good think that my spouse woke up otherwise we would have missed our flight. We told this to the receptionist who didn't to care too much about the situation. &quot;Sorry about that I'll talk to the manager&quot;. Also our minibar wasn't restocked and we had to trust the hotel on our consumption since no one was available to check.The situation is nice(very near the Hancock Tower and the Magnificent Mile) and in comparison to the other hotels it appeared human sized.Mike and Nath
10,260,"Nov 2 2009 	Had Great stay at the Talbott!	From the moment I arrived, I was treated like an honored guest. Staff is amazingly friendly without being overbearing--every staffperson gives you their name from the doorman to the concierge. They have a nightly turndown service with chocolates on the pillow. This is a historically renovated hotel that still has amazing modern conveniences--electric buttons for stating when you don't want to be disturbed. They also have many eco friendly choices. Plush robes in the rooms, amazing towels. We used the one conference room for our meeting and it was the perfect size for a group of 20 or so. I slept great and cannot wait to go back to this hotel."
11,260,"Oct 29 2009 	Great hotel in a great location.	My husband and I recently stayed at the Talbott for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our room was a &quot;Deluxe Parlor King&quot; which the Web site says is 520 sq ft. The room was HUGE, which made it very comfortable for an extended stay. (Our room appeared to be a handicapped accessible room which makes me wonder if it was even a little larger than that type of room would normally be.) The bathroom was very large also, with a separate tub and shower and Aveda products. The towels were nicer than our towels at home. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was just a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue so it was close to lots of great shopping, restaurants and sites. The free breakfast was okay if you like to keep it simple in the morning (toast/croissants, yogurt, lunch meats &amp; cheeses, cereal). If you need a little more, there is a great diner nearby (Tempo Cafe), a place across the street and a Starbuck's in the area. Be sure to also hit the fabulous cupcake shop (More) down the street. One thing that we didn't like was the Business Center. This consisted of one computer which you had to pay to use in 15 minute increments and then pay for copies also. It's free to use for printing boarding passes, but I didn't realize that until after I spent $7 to print ours. Next time, I'll just take a laptop. Despite this, we had a wonderful time at this hotel and will stay there next time we visit Chicago."
12,260,"Oct 29 2009 	Unbelievable value great location..definitely will stay again	The Talbott Hotel was exactly what we were looking for. The Talbott is located in a wonderful location (except for construction...I'll talk about that later). It is a very short walk to Magnificant Mile, Oak Street, the lake and just a couple of streets away from a Metro Stop. It is also a five minute walk to some great restaurants (Gibson's, etc.). There are plenty of places to eat and grab a cup of coffee (i need my starbucks in the morning and there is one across the street) near the hotel. In addition to the great location is the value. We booked this hotel for well below what most hotels in the area were asking and it surpassed our expectations. The rooms were a decent size and included a flat screen television, comfy beds, turndown service and great toiletries. Most importantly, the hotel was very clean.My only concerns were as follows: 1) The hotel is located next to some high rises that are currently under construction and unfortunately our room faced the construction so we were subject to some construction noises in the morning. Nothing unbearable, but obvious. 2) The bellman and doormen were extremely friendly and willing to assist, but some of the front desk attendants seemed somewhat indifferent. I'm not saying they were rude, just not as eager to assist and friendly as I thought they might be (there were one or two exceptions of course). 3) I initially called the hotel to inquire about the best rate guarantee and it seemed as if no one fully understood it at the reservation desk except the manager who called me back later to explain it. I think everyone taking reservations should have a full understanding of the guarantee and how it works, otherwise don't market it. The Talbott isn't the exception here, it seems many hotels put price guarantees on their websites and then when you call to take them up on it the reservation desk often don't know what the policy is or tell you the wrong policy.Overall, I would stay here again and probably request a room facing the front of the building (away from construction). It is a very cozy hotel in a great location."
13,260,"Oct 27 2009 	Very Comfortable Accomodations	We arrived before noon expecting just to leave our bags, but were shown to our room where we were able to relax before heading out. Staff was consistently friendly and solicitous, especially the concierges Tim and Stephanie."
14,260,"Oct 25 2009 	Great value hotel in Chicago city center	We stayed 3 nights at the Talbott hotel. And the experience was very positive.Tt was the cheapest hotel in the tripadvisor top 10 for Chicago, yet value was certainly not cheap: nice spacy rooms, huge flat screen TV, large badroom, all very clean. Also you're just a few blocks away from all main streets and from the Hancock tower.A tip when booking: book directly on the website of the Talbott hotel, because then you'll also get free vouchers for breakfast at the hotel - when booking through other internet channels you will not get those vouchers!"
15,260,"Oct 19 2009 	Wow - great hotel	What a great place. The hotel is around the corner from great shops and attractions like the Sears Tower and about five to ten minutes walk to the beach.I stayed in a suite which was wonderful. The most comfortable sofa I have sat on in years. Huge LCD televisions with cable (High Def). A large bathtub with jacuzzi-type jets that massage you when you're lying in it., and a walk in shower. A large, comfortable bed too.I'm just sorry I only stayed for a night.One thing - I booked a standard room a few weeks in advance at a rate of about $300. When I checked their website again nearer the time, I could get a suite for the same price. It's worth checking the day before you arrive as prices seem to change all the time - you might get lucky like me and get a suite for the normal price of a standard"
16,260,"Oct 14 2009 	More than I expected even after reading reviews!	My boyfriend and I just stayed at the Talbott this past weekend and LOVED it. The hotel was perfect for the night we wanted to spend in the city before visiting family in the suburbs. The location was wonderful. It is just blocks from Michigan Avenue which made our shopping and eating out plans very easy. The hotel is on a nice street with a good restaurant (Feast) across the way. We had breakfast there. The one thing I will say, as we did not plan to have breakfast anywhere but the hotel, is that the complimentary breakfast you get by booking through the hotel Web site is not great. It featured a few cereals and some stale bread and lunch meat. We were disappointed but did not expect too much given that it was free. The wait staff in the morning seemed annoyed with the complimentary breakfast people. That was surprising because the night before we had drinks in the bar and thought the bartender was great. (FYI - Two seven and sevens and two cosmos cost us around $50 with a generous tip)I room was really nice. It was a great size with a comfortable, large bed and a good size bathroom. The hotel is very eco-friendly which is always a plus. The entire staff was very helpful and made our trip great. When we left we wished we could stay another night. With tax we paid about $180 for the night. If the price is similar in the future this will be our hotel choice for all of our visits."
17,260,"Sep 28 2009 	Elegance in the city	We stayed at the Chicago Talbott in August 2009. I almost booked a room at another high profile property, but having read the promising reviews for this place on Trip Advisor, I decided to take a chance on this boutique hotel. The Talbott is certainly an older, renovated property and although the lobby is small, there is an adjoining small restaurant and bar area (with outdoor seating). The continental breakfast was fine considering it was complimentary. The hotel is surrounded by active, ongoing construction, but we hardly noticed it during the weekend. This hotel is situated in the middle of the best bars, shopping and restaurants in the city. We spent very little time in our room but it was quite comfortable even though the furnishings were somewhat dated. In spite of that, what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the high level of refinement and service that is readily apparent when dealing with the hotel employees. Sometimes the personnel that staff these high end properties can be quite snooty to their guests, but the Talbott team was gracious and always helpful. That attribute alone made this hotel a real winner."
18,260,"Sep 23 2009 	Extraordinary service at the Talbott a home away from home in Chicago.	We were in Chicago for a long weekend to celebrate a 20th Wedding Anniversary.The Talbott was the perfect choice to meet all of our needs. We stayed in King Suite and were impressed with the size of the room with a separate bedroom, living room area and extra large bathroom with soaking tub, shower and two vanities. Loved all of the windows and natural light that came into the room, we felt like we were at a home away from home. Hotel was very quiet and floors don't have as many rooms as a large chain hotel. Location was excellent for sightseeing and visiting shops along Michigan Ave. Hotel staff was extraordinary and all from valet, bellman, front desk and concierge staff were very nice and made us feel welcome at all times. Equinox fitness center was very nice, even if it is not in the hotel. We were able to use the healthclub to get a good workout. Also need to mention free WIFi internet access. Book online with hotel and recieve complimentary continental breakfast. Only drawback was the hotel has two small elevators for 16 floors but we never had to wait long. The hotel next door was under construction during our visit but we did not hear any noise as we were on the 10th floor of the hotel. Good proximity to Rush Street, Michigan Ave. We would return to the Talbott for our next visit to Chicago."
19,260,"Sep 17 2009 	Highly Recommend This Hotel	My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. The room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. Linens and towels first-class. Free Wi-Fi in the room. The location is terrific, just one block to Michigan Avenue. We will stay here on future visits."
20,260,"Sep 1 2009 	Quaint luxury in the heart of what's happening!	I have stayed at the Talbott a number of times, mostly for business and sometimes for pleasure. It is just beautiful, the rooms feel like a luxurious version of home and the staff could not be more pleasant. All that, and you are in walking distance of so much to do in Chicago... the Talbott really has it all!"
21,260,"Aug 31 2009 	We love the Talbott!	We took a family trip with 28, 18 and 15 year old children to Chicago. I found The Talbott on TripAdvisor and wanted to let everyone know we loved it. Small, European style hotel, with lovely lobby area (lots of woodwork) but most impressive was the staff. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The rooms were beautful and spotless. Our only issue was a bartender that didn't seem to enjoy her job...but that was minor. The rest of the staff went above and beyond. I would highly recommend The Talbott for singles, couples or families."
22,260,"Aug 28 2009 	My home away from home	I travel to Chicago 4 times a year and never stay anywhere but The Talbott. A smallish european style hotel, with great ambience and a staff that makes me feel like family. From the moment I arrive, I am greeted by name and welcomed &quot;home&quot;. The front desk staff are friendly and efficient. The bell staff always available to perform any task with a smile. The concierge, Stephanie Emrich, is without equal. Restaurant suggestions, theatre tickets, sightseeing ideas, shopping, cultural adventures, any request, however great or small is handled with ease. She has been there, experienced it and can make it happen. Can't wait for my return visit in November! Sheila Bielich, Plano, Texas"
23,260,"Aug 26 2009 	Wow	Being in the &quot;road warrior&quot; world one of the last thing I wanted to do was to go stay in another hotel for a week end. But this was a special week end, our 3rd wedding aniversery. My Wife sugguested that we stay at the Talboots for this week end. Boy! what an experiance. From the time I dropped off our &quot;special car&quot; giving the door man strict insturctions on how it was to be treated, to the check in desk, the bell man who showed us all the neat tricks of the room, and the list goes on.My Wife had been in contact with Concierge, Stephanie, and the two of them surprised me with dinner reservations for Friday and Saturday evneing, what my Wife did not know was I surprised her with tickets to the Solhiem Cup on Friday. By the time we got to the hotel our thoughts of about dinner had changed and, Stephanie was in true form got our dinner reservations changed to suit our late arrival times, and advised us that at the Friday night dinner time there was a group of 45 people arriving ahead of us and she sugguested to move our dinner time back to avoid the rush. This was a great idea, and I doubt if anyone else would have sugguested to move dinner to later time as to not upset a guest and tell them that there dinner reservation was not available.During this talk with Stephanie, we where talking about some tours we wanted to do on Saturday. When we returned from a wonderfull dinner, Stephanie had taken the time to look into the tours that we wanted to do and advised us of the available times for Saturday. With this information at hand, we where able to plan our Saturday and still have a time to rest before dinner. Again all I can say is WOW.The Talbott's have a new local customer. See you soon."
24,260,Aug 24 2009 	Loved the Talbott	I don't ever take the time to write a review but the Talbott was so nice it deserves another recommendation. Robert and Andrew greeted us as we walked in and made our stay so pleasant. They bent over backwards to make us happy - even as far as making dinner reservations for us. The concierge was a bit condescending but the rest of the staff more than made up for it. The rooms were large and well appointed and very clean. The beds were amazing. The bathroom had thick towels and robes. Will definitely stay there again - got a great deal from 1800 hotels on short notice. The construction next door was a non-issue as we did not hear a thing.
25,260,"Aug 23 2009 	Fantastic Find!	My husband, young son and I were visiting family in Milwaukee and decided to take the train to Chicago for a night. I searched the internet at the last minute for a place to stay and came across the Talbott. What a wonderful find! We got to the hotel at 10:30am thinking we would just leave our luggage and go explore till check in, but our room was ready and they kindly let us check in early. We stayed in a deluxe king room, which was very spacious. The room was clean and very well maintained. We couldn't have asked for a better location. Just a few blocks from Michigan Ave. and many stores and restaurants.I hope we get to go back and stay longer next time!"
26,260,"Aug 22 2009 	Perfect Location and room	This hotel was recommended to us and it lived up to expectations. It is ideally situated in walking distance of many of the sites and is minutes walk from Michigan Ave.The hotel provided brekfast free of charge (we booked online to get this) and the room was spacious and newly decorated. Large plasms TV, free WIFI etc.Even though there is building work next door there was no noise or dust and we sat outside the hotel everyday for breakfast and occasionally for an afternoon drink.The staff are friendly and importantly the hotel is a lot cheaper than the four seasons and other well known hotels just down the road."
27,260,"Aug 22 2009 	The Talbott is perfectly located appointed and staffed for a great experience.	I chose the Talbott Hotel because of reviews on Trip Advisor and thought I should contribute to those accolades. Unlike the large more impersonal hotels The Talbott has all the amenities of those luxury hotels. This boutique hotel's concierge service is impeccable, and all staff are friendly. It is located only two blocks from Michigan Avenue and the John Hancock Centre - close to all the major stores and tourist attractions. You won't make a mistake booking your stay here - ideal for business or romantic travel."
28,260,Aug 21 2009 	Talbott Hotel is the best hotel in Chicago with it's intimate size and elegant decor great location personable staff!	My favorite place to stay in town. Talbott Hotel epitomizes classic Chicago!
29,260,"Aug 20 2009 	A hidden gem	My husband and I recently stayed one night at the Talbott. Our stay started out great when we were given a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite. It was fabulous! The living room was large with a couch, two comfy chairs, a flat screen tv and a full-size desk. The bathroom was also quite large with 2 sinks. What a treat to not have to share! We booked on-line, so we received a complimentary continental breakfast. The free breakfast is very limited: juice, cereal, yogurt, cold cuts and muffins. We were able to upgrade to a better breakfast for $5. However, we would not have known about this if we hadn't been eavesdropping on other diners. (Our waiter was not very helpful.) The $5 breakfast was 2 eggs, sausage or bacon and potatoes. This was quite a bargain and it arrived piping hot! Always a plus in my book. The Talbott is in a great location. It is only a few blocks from Michigan Avenue, very close to the Hancock Building and Water Tower Place. Despite all the construction being done outside the hotel, we did not hear any noise. (We were there Friday/Saturday.) I am not sure if the noise would have been worse during the week. Another plus was the free Wi-Fi. I am still amazed that so many high-end hotels charge for this. I would highly recommend the Talbott Hotel!"
30,260,"Aug 20 2009 	Excellent service and stay!!	Our family, including two teen girls, stayed at The Talbott for one week recently. We had a one bedroom suite with adjoining king bedroom (two bedroom suite, actually) and found the rooms to be impeccably clean and comfortable. The decor was beautiful and it was a nice retreat after hours of shopping and sightseeing. The Talbott is a very short walk off Michigan Avenue located between State and Rush so we were never far from restaurants, clubs, bars, and, of course, SHOPPING! My husband and I walked along Rush and enjoyed the nightlife during our &quot;dates&quot;. The staff at The Talbott were very friendly and helpful. The bellmen and concierge always had a smile and a &quot;can we help you?&quot; attitude. We make an annual trip to the Windy city from South Florida and will definitely consider staying at The Talbott again!!"
31,260,"Aug 13 2009 	Impeccable Service 	This was our first stay at Talbot Hotel. We had stayed at several other 4 and 5 star hotels in the city over the years. The Talbot was a pleasant surprise! We had an impeccable room/suite -so clean, roomy, up to date and relaxing!The help was ever so kind-we didn't confront any employee that didn't go out of there way to be friendly, helpful and comforting to each of us. We will definetely return to the Talbot over other over priced 4 and 5 star hotels in Chicago."
32,260,"Aug 6 2009 	update review	Since I wrote my previous review about Talbott hotel, I decided to update it because the hotel had dealt with those issues and they all have been sorted out.After I reported my complaints to the duty manager, the restaurant staffs were completely changed on the second day when I had my breakfast. They were asking everybody whether they hold a breakfast voucher. Their attitudes were also changed in positive way. They became very friendly and helpfull.The bellman has also changed after I put my complaint through. He was smiling and trying his best to make everybody satisfied. The sale manager Patrick did contact me personally and assured me that they will take all the action to prevent same type of problems from hapenning in the future. I found it very professionalMy complaint and feedback were crucial and necessary to change the staff and service in a positive way.Since I have seen that they have changed I can now recommend this hotel to the people I know now that they take the feedback seriously and things could change in nice way straightaway.You should not be worrying if you had any trouble at this hotel, I am sure they will deal with it and make u satisfy in any way they can"
33,260,"Aug 4 2009 	Comfortable stay in downtown Chicago	My wife and I stayed at the Talbot Hotel downtown Chicago and we enjoyed our stay. Room was comfortable as we requested top floor facing away from the construction next door. The construction was not an issue for us but because we were on the top floor we could hear the elevator running I guess because we were on the top floor. If I went back I would request a high floor but not the 16th floor. The staff was absolutely amazing, friendly, helpful and the room was large and comfortable. Free internet always a plus. Comfortable beds, pillows, nice TV, two sinks in the bathroom, good shower and a safe in the room for storing valuables. I left my IPOD out and the cleaning people did not disturb it. No pool. Other trip notes, great take out place to grab food right across the street. Easy access to L train to go to Wrigley or White Sox Cellular field. Room was $179/night special summer rate. We would definitely stay here again."
34,260,"Aug 1 2009 	Best of the Boutiques	My wife and I just returned from a week's stay at the Talbott in Chicago. It was truly a great vacation and the Talbott is a cut above the rest.My wife loved the room so much, that for 2 days she just wanted to stay in the room while I had errands during the day. She especially liked the heater on the marble bathroom floors."
35,260,"Jul 28 2009 	Terrific location at the Talbott	We stayed 5 nights at the Talbott which was in easy walking distance of the Hancock Tower, Millenium park, Sears Tower etc. Staff were friendly, and helpful. Menu was varied but limited. Numerous Restaurants nearby, avoid Gibsons as very expensive. We had large comfortable Room with walk in wardrobe, well equipped bathroom with his and hers toilet rolls and basins. Not cheap, but central and not as expensive as the Water Tower next door."
36,260,"Jul 22 2009 	Elegant and comfortable	As you enter through the scaffolding, you immediately sense an old world elegant feel to the hotel. We had booked a double queen room and were pleasantly surprised by the spacious room. (I think it was twice the size of the room at the nearby W which I will not visit again). The beds were very comfortable and the room decorations were luxurious. I enjoyed the Aveda bathroom products. There were comfortable robes for 2.Booking online got us complimentary buffet breakfast for 2. The buffet was very nice and we sat outside on a beautiful morning. It will be nicer when the construction next door is finished.The concierge was very helpful for dinner and recommended a local hotspot where he booked us a table that same night. That restaurant was packed with a long wait (over an hour), but we weren't that hungry so we waited at the bar. I didn't expect much since we had only just made the reservations. We were pleasantly surprised when not more than 10 minutes had passed and we were seated. the host said that they like the concierge at the Talbott and were accommodating us since we were staying there. Free internet for 24 hours came with the room too. We also took advantage of the passes for the local Equinox. No hotel gym can compare to a full service gym like Equinox. We had great workouts!"
37,260,"Jul 21 2009 	The best in Chicago	The Talbott must be the best, most convenient and comfortable hotel in Chicago!We had a kingsize room, with a huge bed with enough room for a bunch of people...The hotel style is &quot;European&quot; in an American way, which means dark colours and tartans.Not very stylish, but tres burgeois! The service was mediate, front desk could take advantage of more smiling, and snob down a little... The hotel is extremely well located, just off the Michigan Avenue with all the stylish shops and great reataurant.I would chose this hotel again!"
38,260,"Jul 20 2009 	WHAT A GREAT STAY	What a fabulous hotel, we'll never stay anyplace else in Chicago! We travel frequently, and the Talbott was such a pleasant surprise. The location is absolutley ideal, just 2 blocks off Michigan and close to everything! We were warmly greeted upon arrival and our room was larger than most and very well appointed, with flat panel TV, very nice bedding and towels and nicely appointed, and free WI-FI. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly, and that speaks for the entire staff. Just a great experience and we'll not stay anywhere else when we return to Chicago!"
39,260,"Jul 19 2009 	A comfortable and warm stay	My wife and I took a trip to Chicago to celebrate our 30th birthdays and had heard great things about The Talbott, and were able to get a decent rate on a single room suite. Arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the doorman with the biggest smile that never went away during our entire stay. We actually arrived around 9am and they were able to get us into our suite without issue which was a huge plus. They also surprised us with complimentary daily breakfasts because we reserved our room through their site.The hotel its self is bit older but has been well maintained, and still has the warm feeling that you really dont get from newer more modern places. The room was outstanding with a huge living space, what seemed like an even larger bathroom, and a great bedroom. The king bed was one of the best that I have ever slept on; my wife had the same thought. The bathroom which is covered in marble had a separate room for the toilet, a large bathtub, a large glass shower and three sinks. Two of them are together while the other is on the opposite side of the bathroom which is quite nice if there are two people getting ready at the same time.The location is optimal and basically walking distance from everything. Its a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile, few blocks from the Hancock building, and a decent walk to the Navy Pier. The street its on gets a bit crowed as they are doing construction next door (which we never heard), but as long as you cross with the lights, youll be fine.I definitely recommend giving The Talbott a try if you want a nice warm, almost like home feeling, while still right in the heart of all the action."
40,260,"Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful experience.	I'd long heard about how wonderful the Talbott was, and was really looking forward to my visit. It far surpassed my expectations. The service was first-class from the moment we arrived until we checked out, the hotel is quite elegant in a very comfortabe way, and the location couldn't be better. Would go back in a heartbeat!"
41,260,"Jul 16 2009 	Loved The Talbot!	What a special place!! Not only is the location ideal, but the outstanding service from the Front Desk insured a wonderful stay for us. Both Sarah and Naomi went out of their way to accommodate my requests to be both away from the construction next door and in a spacious room. Our room was FABULOUS and I can not wait to return to our new favorite place to stay in Chicago!"
42,260,Jul 7 2009 	Great location great hotel staff and rate	My husband and I traveled with my in-laws. They are in their late 80's we are 51. We were all pleased
43,260,"Jun 30 2009 	You should visit this warm elegant comfortable Gold Coast Hotel!	We came to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary and were treated like royalty. The manager sent a chilled bottle of sparkling wine with a fruit tray within minutes of our arrival. The suite was spacious, quiet, and elegantly appointed. The marble bathroom had the thickest, largest towels we've ever seen. There were closets in every room. The king sized bed left us relaxed and refreshed. The staff was eager to make us comfortable from the check in through the time we left and were very helpful answering questions about the neighborhood. We walked from the hotel to Navy Pier along the lake for a dinner/fireworks cruise, and the next day had brunch at the 95th. This is a great place to stay to enjoy the beauty of the city."
44,260,"Jun 17 2009 	luxurious convenient perfect for a city break	The reviews were accurate. I arrieved a little early so it took a while to get a room but for the inconvenience, I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite. If I wanted to live in downtown Chicago, I would love for my place to be the hotel suite I was in. it was perfect. Huge beautiful bathroom and separate bedroom. I only wished I stayed there for more than one night. The location is excellent. a block from Michigan avenue and close to lots of shopping, dining and nightlife but also very safe neighborhood. Most of the staff was extremely pleasant from the doormen to the bellman to the front desk. I really enjoyed my stay here. Also, very comfortable bed."
45,260,"Jun 16 2009 	Excellent small hotel.	My wife and I spent four nights at the Talbott in early June. This first stay at this hotel was everything we wanted for a getaway to the city. Our king room was spacious, quiet, and very comfortable. The bath towels were especially nice.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, yet relaxed. We received excellent service from everyone who helped us. We enjoyed a nice breakfast in the restaurant on two mornings."
46,260,"Jun 16 2009 	Exceptional!	The Talbott provided an exceptional experience while I stayed in Chicago last March. The size of the room was more than comfortable, I was taken a back by how large a room it was given we were in such a large inner city location. The staff was more than accommodating on every request. The interior pulled you in like a cozy bed and breakfast in the country with warm tones and fireplaces, you forgot you were just steps away from all the excitement of the city. If your looking for that special experience, do yourself a favor and book a room at the Talbott!"
47,260,"Jun 16 2009 	Best Hotel in Chicago	Beautiful large guestrooms and suites, excellent service, to-die-for linens...overall one of the best hotel experiences for a group of seasoned travelers."
48,260,"Jun 15 2009 	Great Luxury Boutique Hotel Close To Everything	I stayed at The Talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. The staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The free wi-fi came in handy as I needed to work remotely while there. Everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. Oh, and I got to workout at the huge Equinox right next door for free."
49,260,"Jun 3 2009 	excellent	We come to Chicago once a year for a romantic get away. The Talbott is our favorite hotel so far. You get the same amenities as &quot;bigger names&quot;, but with a price that is very reasonable and a cozier atmosphere. Location is great, staff helpful and friendly. I personally love a smaller hotel that is quaint and high quality. Highly recommend for those looking for the same."
50,260,"May 28 2009 	Great hotel would recommend to all my friends 	My husband &amp; I travel from Ft Laud to Chi-town once a year and this is our 2nd year staying at the Talbott and look forward to coming back next year. Great location close to Michigan Ave &amp; Rush St, and daily passes to the Equinox gym in the Bloomingdales building. We always excercise when traveling therefore a gym is important to us. Hugos Frog Bar on Rush St was a great place for seafood, we even ran into the general mgr for the Chicago Bears. You won't be disappointed staying at The Talbott!"
51,260,"May 14 2009 	No complaints	I don't think I could even think of something to complain about.. Food was excellent, the rooms were clean and beautiful, and the location was great. The service was exceptional, friendly, and helpful beyond expectations helping us with directions around the city, transportation, and anything else we needed.. The only thing that was kind of an eyesore more than anything was the construction on the building next door to the hotel, though we couldn't hear or see it from our room, and there was construction all over the city while we were there. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definetly stay again."
52,260,"May 6 2009 	Luxury Boutique	Very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. I've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. Also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout!"
53,260,"May 5 2009 	Fantastic Location	This Hotel is beautiful, incredible large bedrooms and staff are amazing. Located just a stroll from Michigan avenue, you have the beach, shops and bars on your door step. Will definitly return."
54,260,"Apr 26 2009 	Check the door locks!!!!	There are plenty of great things to say about the Talbott: it's location is brilliant for shopping, restaurants, bars and just about everything the great city of Chicago has to offer. The hotel is beautiful, the lobby is elegant and the rooms are tastefully decorated. We managed to get a great offer via the internet and we chose a corner executive room. However, we did get the 'internet' room which had construction right outside the window! The first downside to this beautiful place is that the cleaners left our room door unlocked when they were finished cleaning. We were certainly surprised when we tried to put the key in and the door swung open. The other downside is that the room service is minimal. We ordered dinner and received a beautifully set up tray with flowers, 2 glasses of water and 2 bowls of pasta and absolutely nothing else. The pasta had been put in the microwave and served in the same bowl, there was no bread, no garnish absolutely nothing. Fo the prices they charged I expected more. The breakfast, which wasn't included in the internet pricing, was very good. I would recommend this hotel for a nice shopping weekend."
55,260,"Apr 11 2009 	Very nice hotel nice location and very friendly staff.	My wife and I just returned from a trip to Chicago, and agree with other reviewers that this hotel is a gem. It has a great location (2 blocks from magnificent mile, and 1.5 mile walk to the original Marshall Field's). The staff was very friendly, and accomodations had an old-Chicago flair. I believe the building next door is under construction, but it was not that loud, and you could only hear the workers during business hours (maybe this was the reason for the great price? It did not disturb our stay). Parking was not included (I don't stay in big cities often, so I'm not sure if that is normal). I would also recommend trying to book though the hotel - it was SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than any of the travel searches, like Orbitz. It had a 40&quot;+ Aquas tv, available mini fridge on request, and nice elavators (some of the other elavators in town made my life flash before my eyes...)."
56,260,Mar 30 2009 	Like a Bed and Breakfast Intimate hotel	I was first at the Talbott about 10 years ago and was pleasantly surprised by the small warm interior surroundings. I was walking into a private livingroom where you feel like opening up a book and curling up in forot of the fire. A quaint little bar/restaurant with as well. The service is not outstanding however they are always polite. Perhaps I simply wish people to WOW me.! The bathrooms ( which I had - cannot say they are all like this in every room) could be updated as they are not in line with the sumptious bedroom allure.I would recommend a night stay at the Talbott.
57,260,"Mar 17 2009 	Makes one feel that one is to the Manor born	Upon entering the lobby you feel like you have stepped into an English men's club. Cosy, charming, and elegant, this hotel makes you feel that you are a guest in someone's home.I stayed in the King deluxe room which was very spacious. The bed featured a pillow top mattress and this was the first time that I have ever noticed the bedding in a hotel stay.The bathroom features both a shower and a soaking tub which I took ample use of. The mini bar was the most upscale one that I have seen with Voss water, exceptional wine, and gourmet cookies along with the usual array of soft drinks, beers etc.It was room service all the way for me. I recommend the Lasagna Emiliana and the chocolate gelatto for dinner along with the bottle of wine from the mini bar and the Banana-stuffed Brioche French Toast with Mascarpone, Hazelnuts and syrup for Breakfast.If you don't feel like staying in, the hotel is well located and I would think about dining at Le Colonial or Pierrot Gourmet just blocks away.I admit, I stayed here last December and had an issue with the hotel, but because they followed up so professionally and promptly, I decided to stay here again when I chose to stay here rather than a night at Northwestern hospital."
58,260,"Mar 8 2009 	Great hotel - wonderful staff	I have stayed at this hotel several times for business and I love staying here. The beds are VERY comfortable, they have robes in the room, the rooms are nice and spacious, and the staff is incredibly helpful. I highly recommend this hotel."
59,260,"Feb 28 2009 	Great location restaurant and staff!	Be careful if you stay in rooms ending in 07 or 08, early construction starts on that side of the building....very loud and annoying. Other than that it was an excellent place to stay.Nice small lobby with fireplaces where you can sit and have a drink. Cabs pull up right in front of hotel. We loved it. We were there on a college visit so got a great rate."
60,260,"Feb 25 2009 	Awesome Hotel	We stayed at the Talbot for two nights. Loved everything about the hotel. The staff was wonderful, helpful and extremely friendly. The room was elegant, spacious,clean and quiet. Location was great as we walked everywhere. We didn't eat at the restaurant as there are so many other choices (just ask the concierge!). Only negative was spending 48 dollars a day for parking...but I guess that comes with being in the city. We would definitely recommend this hotel!"
61,260,"Feb 23 2009 	Wonderful relaxing hotel - will definitely be back!	Just spent a long weekend at the Talbott. We booked via the small luxury hotel website and received a free room upgrade. The room was very spacious for a Chicago hotel. The doorman was just excellent and had good suggestions for us. The hotel is nicely located, just a couple of blocks from the Hancock Center. Wonderful stay, will definitely go back!"
62,260,"Feb 13 2009 	Fantastic Boutique Hotel With A Friendly And Helpful Staff	The rooms were spacious which surprised me based on previous stays at other hotelss in Chicago. The rate was less than I've paid in other hotels in this city.I loved the High Definition Television in the room.Technical support helped me get logged in to the high speed internet connections within a couple of minutes.The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations for dining. They helped me print out a boarding pass in the business center at no charge.The Bell Hop ran down a cabbie for me several times and helped with fare information.I will be strongly recommending this hotel for business colleagues, friends and family."
63,260,"Feb 2 2009 	Chicago's Best Boutique Hotel	Lavish, but not overdone, this hotel makes the average person feel like a member of royalty, if only for the night. From the lobby to the rooms, The Talbott offers rich, elegant dcor which add to the charm and old world luxuriousness of this grand old hotel. Great dining and even good shopping choices make this one of Chicagos most elegant boutique hotels. Ive stayed at the Palmer House and the Ritz Carlton. Both are great but The Talbott tops them hands down."
64,260,"Dec 28 2008 	Great Stay	Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift, but everything else made up for that.Positives: Bed was very comfortable, great to have real shower, free internet, gym usage, staff (all friendly) and location.Negative: Lift noise, lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in)Would stay again!"
65,260,"Nov 28 2008 	Great Trip	Had a great stay -- staff was more than accomodating from the moment we arrived. Provided superior service.We live in the western burbs and stayed an evening in Chicago before heading out of town on vacation. Did so to have easy access to public transportaiton on Thanksgiving Day. Bed was extremely comfortable, pillow and linens were great.Will definite consider again next year when we travel out of Chicago."
66,260,"Nov 24 2008 	Loved The Talbott	The location, the room, the staff all outstanding. don't eat there, and don't waste money on a drink....that's the only thing that was not so great. But there are so many great places right around The Talbott, it's the place to stay!"
67,260,"Nov 23 2008 	Loved the Talbott	This was my 3rd or 4th stay at the Talbott. I really do love this hotel. The location is only 3 blocks from the Chicago/State red line stop. 2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower.Over the last 2 years since I started staying at the Talbott when in Chicago, I feel the value for the dollar isn't as good as it was. But this is understandable. It is a great hotel, so is on par with other hotels charging similar rates.You used to get passes to the Fitness Formula Club (gold coast location) a short few blocks away, but now they give you passes to the Equinox club which is actually closer on Michigan Ave. However, the Fitness Formula Club was way better. It was much bigger and had a huge selection of equipment. So this is disappointing.Free internet is very reliable. Never once had any problem.Next time I'm in Chicago, even though I love the Talbott, I think I might try something else since the same money can buy other hotels rated just as high on trip advisor."
68,260,Nov 20 2008 	Great hotel	We loved our stay at the Talbott. We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was well decorated and spacious. My wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago. Highly recommended.
69,260,"Nov 13 2008 	Wonderful intimate hotel!	My wife and I recently enjoyed a couple of days in Chicago to see a play and fully enjoyed our experience at the Talbott. Initially, I was worried about the service due to the concierge's inability to return my e-mails in reference to ordering flowers for my wife, but after a call to the hotel, the concierge was more than helpful and the arrangement ordered was absolutely perfect. The lobby is small (or intimate as you prefer), so if you like to feel anonymous as you enter or leave, this is not the hotel for you. Doormen, bellmen, and receptionists WILL be attending to your needs or wishing you well with big smiles. Being an older hotel, sometimes there is a wait for an elevator (they're slow and small), but not overly so. The rooms were spacious and clean, and the bathroom in our suite was huge and absolutely gorgeous (we'll be remodeling ours soon). My wife visited Lush and the Body Shop for supplies and took no less then three baths during our stay. Our bed was absolutely comfortable. I would agree with others that there is quite a bit of construction in the area (like right next door!), but in reality, we hardly noticed it. If you hear a hammer, turn on the Ipod ready radio or the 42&quot; widescreen TV. It IS the city, after all. The location is wonderful! Only a couple minute stroll to Water Tower Place and an $8.00 cab ride to the Oriental Theater. On the whole, our stay was wonderful and an absolute bargain compared with other hotels in the area. We'll be back."
70,260,"Nov 1 2008 	Enjoyable Stay	We have just returned from a 4 night city break in Chicago. Booking at last minute caused us problems finding a vacant hotel. The Talbott itself only offered an expensive rate for a suite (last room available). We tracked down a MUCH cheaper rate on activehotels.com for a regular room.On arriving at the Talbott, we were upgraded to the one-bedroom suite! As all comments have mentioned, there is a LOT of building work going on immediately adjacent to the hotel. However, as we were jetlag wise, 5 hours ahead of Chicago time, we were out of the hotel by 0800 and didn't return till late, so heard no noise at all. The suite was comfortable and spacious, with free wifi. Bathroom had 2 large sinks - plenty of room for my husband and myself to spread out. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable, and we are both very fussy in this respect.Location was excellent - as the weather was sunny, we pretty much walked everywhere. The concierge (both Stephanie and Tim) were very knowledgeable and helpful, coming up with good recommendations for steakhouses that would not be packed with convention goers and fellow tourists. All the staff were friendly and welcoming - we enjoyed our stay, and would readily return to the hotel."
71,260,Oct 10 2008 	Great choice	I generally stay at the Omni in Chicago but they were booked so I found this hotel for a great deal on orbitz ($199 per night) and booked it. It was great. The location is Ideal. Walk right onto Rush street and enjoy some of the best food in town. The decor in the hotel is very nice and the beds very comfy. I found the room to be very clean and the staff helpfull. I think this will be my first choice in the future.
72,260,"Oct 8 2008 	Love the talbot	The talbot was great. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was updated. The street that the Talbot is on is great, it is a side street that is tree lined. There is a Starbucks right across the street. The bar/restaurant in the hotel is really nice too. It is small but a nice cozy place to get a cocktail. I would highly recommend this hotel."
73,260,"Sep 24 2008 	Lovely Boutique in Excellent Location	A great location only 1 1/2 blocks from North Michigan Avenue. Very quiet part of the street. Lovely, quaint lobby with professional attendants who checked us in early to a spotless room. The room was a double queen and was, by all hotel standards, huge! Most hotels would have somehow carved the space up into 2 rooms. This gave our children someplace to play. The only downside was that the room felt humid, despite every attempt we made to re-adjust the HVAC. Otherwise, it was wonderful and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
74,260,"Aug 31 2008 	Great visit to the city!	My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists. What a beautiful hotel! Our room was lovely, the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. They don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there.We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel, as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping.There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago."
75,260,"Aug 19 2008 	Very nice but	I spent four nights at the Talbott. The hotel is good, the staff were very pleasant and helpful, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable and the bed was fantastic. I will stay there again once downtown Chicago has been rebuilt, as this is what seems to be going on right now. The noise from the construction in the vicinity was intrusive and off-putting and it looks like they have a long way to go.I will be back to the Talbott for sure, but not soon. And it's certainly not a reflection on the hotel itself or the staff, simply the noise."
76,260,"Aug 18 2008 	Love the hotel but not the restaurant.	The Talbott Hotel in Chicago is my very favorite hotel in the City. The hotel is a small European style hotel with beautiful rooms and an excellent staff. The only thing that wasn't up to pare is the restaurant, and the quality has declined a lot since the last time I stayed at the Talbott. The fruit on the fruit plate was overripe, the yogurt was sour, the coffee was just lukewarm and the breakfast assortment of breads was stale. The service in the restaurant was also poor. The restaurant has a beautiful outside dining area and would be wonderful if the food and service was better. After eating breakfast there we decided to find someplace else for dinner. Hopefully they will improve on this but if not, I'll still stay at the Talbott but find someplace else to eat."
77,260,"Aug 7 2008 	Brilliant position great staff and lovely rooms	Spent two nights in the Talbott during our summer vacation. The hotel is well situated for sighseeing, shopping (on the magnificant mile) and good restaurants. The hotel has a great atmosphere and lots of character. Our room was massive and extremely comfortable. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The only slight negative was the building work that is going on next door, the work is however restricted to set hours (8-5) and the sound insulation is good so this didn't really bother us. We got a very good rate on the internet."
78,260,Aug 6 2008 	Wonderful experience	We stayed here 4 nights for a conference which my husband was attending close by. We are members of the Small Luxury Hotel group and made the booking via their website. We didn't realized we'd be upgraded when we arrived - we ended up in a beautiful suite which was very nice considering it was a longer trip than usual.The service was excellent and the beds extremely comfortable.There's a great wine bar just across the street and also a little cafe/deli across the street which was convenient to pick up light breakfast and snacks.
79,260,"Aug 5 2008	Great hotel - horrible location	This is a nice hotel and the people were great but I would not stay there again until the construction around it is finished. The elevator in the alley attached to the hotel starts as early as 5:30am and goes into the night - including weekends. Use of the dumpsters (filling and emptying) is constant. Worst of all, to me, is having a restaurant with a sidewalk cafe right next to a construction site with rats running around - truly disgusting."
80,260,"Aug 4 2008 	Nothing but the best!	My wife and I spent one night at the Talbott Hotel, and loved it.Upon Arrival, we were greeted by two hotel staff prior to reaching the front desk. The girl at the desk was both professional, and courteous; acknowledging our special occasion and giving us a complementary upgrade to a suite was such a nice touch. Because we booked through AAA, we got a great deal on the room rate as it was, including strawberries, wine, and breakfast for two.We had also chosen the Talbott for its close proximity to Chicago's famous steakhouse Gibson's (less than a 10 min walk). Note: make dinner reservations in advance, or see the hotel concierge. On a funnier note: Gibson's is located in the heart of the Viagra Triangle: Google Viagra Triangle for more info.The suite was spacious and &quot;very clean.&quot; The living room area had a a 42&quot; flat screen TV, and there was a 27&quot; flat screen in the bedroom. The bathroom (spotless) had both a shower and a large tub that could seat two. The bedroom was comfy, with a nice king size bed.The only drawback to the whole occasion, was the $48 dollar overnight parking fee.... we had thought it was going to be $20, but hey, it's Chicago, and everything is more expensive these days."
81,260,"Jul 29 2008 	Brilliant - couldn't fault it!	I booked this hotel through the SLH (Small Luxury Hotel Group). Having stayed in their hotels before and were impressed, we thought we would do the same for our trip to Chicago.A fantastic location for everything, from eating and drinking out to shopping and getting tours. It's located on Delaware Place, which is near the famous eating area on Rush Street. Less than 5 minutes walk away.The room was spacious and has a very good ensuite. The bed was very comfortable and very clean. The towels were changed twice a day if needed. It had a good TV if needed also. It was quiet and although our room was near some building work next door, we rarely heard anything at all. We were located on the 8th floor overlooking the front.The Concierge made our stay worth while in every way. He was friendly, informative and very approachable and willing to help and advise. He is worth his weight in gold. Although all the staff were friendly and helpful, I was say the Concierge, Gene, was the star member of staff.We ate at some very, very good restaurants - our favourite being the Le Colonial, on Rush Street. A French/Vietnamese style restaurant. Our second favourite in the same area was Gibsons. What a great place for a fantasic choice of steaks. Hugo's next door for seafood was also outstanding. There's a restaurant called Japanais, which had brilliant reviews, but we ran out of time to go there - next time!Gene booked us to see the Jersey Boys at the Theatre. Although the tickets were a bit pricey, the show was outstanding and worth every penny. I learnt a lot about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and thoroughly enjoyed the music and their performance on the everning. I would go again!We had a fabulous week in Chicago and we will definately return again and stay at the Talbott. Thank you to everyone who made our stay a delight.ColeyHampshire, England"
82,260,"Jul 28 2008 	Great value great service	This is a great find for downtown Chicago. The price is right and the staff are excellent. As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk. Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. Would definitely stay here again."
83,260,"Jul 15 2008 	Great value-middle of everything biz related	Solid value for the biz traveler----Meant to post this long ago, so, not current info; but, I am posting due to fact I looked at Tripadvisor to see how things sounded, as am planning return to Chicago soon, and, will probably stay at Talbott. Have stayed 3 times over last year or so; first time, had never heard of it, a bit hesitant as usually stay Hilton or similar, but a pal who stays Talbott once a month and travels a lot to other towns so very experienced traveler, he just kept talking it up. Excellent value for biz folks who pay their own way. In the middle of most meeting sites for downtown biz, never had a problem getting a cab, fairly responsive staff-all 3 times I thought they were a bit aloof but reality is I think they are just very very business like-if you ask for something you get it, or you get an explanation as to why you will not get it, etc, so, I will take that over warm and fuzzy non-performance everytime--the food/bar was not something to go out of your way for but fine for stay in the room or on property when you are tired or weather is bad. Best suited for business single, would be pretty good for couples and it is well placed for a travel companion to entertain themselves while you are out in meetings, probably not a big hit for kids and teens but if you were truly just looking for solid safe downtown value on a bed and bath to attend a wedding or similar nearby, it is a great option. Take a peek at the bar--it is great wood work and craftsmanship on display, a nice element for a small hotel bar to see cool looking woodwork and not just a cold utility type place."
84,260,Jul 2 2008 	Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location	This is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location.I stayed one night in June 08 and was upgraded to a suite as the hotel was fully booked! The suite was beautifully decorated and well equipped.My stay was trouble free and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.Would recommend to both the business and holiday traveller.
85,260,"Jun 28 2008 	The best Hotel experience ever.	I recently decided on a trip to Chicago. Previously I had stayed at the Le Meridien (now the site of the Conrad Hotel) and was debating a return stay at that facility since my previous exeperience was great.I did some research and decided to try and stay at a different hotel. Using tripadvisor as my main source, in addition to Orbitz and Expedia, I kept noticing that The Talbott Hotel came up as a favorite spot, so with some trepidation (I will admit) I booked my 4 nite stay there. Arriving at the hotel, for me the first thing I noticed was the small lobby area....having stayed mostly at Hilton, Hyatt and other business-type hotels, I was used to larger lobbies, and multiple desk attendants, but I absorbed the experience and checked in. I was upgraded due to the fact that I had reserved my room thru the slh.com website (Small Luxury hotels), of which The Talbott was a member. That website encourages the person to create a list of their pet likes, pillow types, food, etc...and I created a list of things I enjoyed.The room, was spacious, wonderfully appointed, comfortable and met all of my needs. A few minutes after I had started to uppack my luggage, the door bell rang, and a waiter appeared, carrying a large bowl of fruits and other items, I was surprised as I had not ordered anything.When I opened the letter, it was a typed welcome letter, indicating that enclosed were a few items I had indicated I liked (chocolates, bottled water, etc....) and that anything I need I was to contact the desk. What a wonderful way to be welcomed, I thought.I had a few things I wanted to do while in Chicago, and so I went downstairs to the Concierge and met Stephanie. Now any of you who have read back reviews from folk who have stayed at The Talbott will recall that many people praised Stephanie as a wonderful host, and Concierge. Well, I cannot say enough about her. I spent the better part of 40 minutes chatting with her about what kind of restaurants i wanted to try (it was my birthday) and other things i wanted to do. She took notes, went online and showed me different restaurants that she could recommend, called them up to make reservations as I was sitting there, and mae a couple reservations at those that the times were amenable to me. I ate at the RL restaurant (yes, Ralph Lauren), and was personally greeted when I walked in. I asked them how did you know my name, and they replied that Stephanie had called them to let them know I was coming over. I was overwhelmed...I had never experienced such special attention at any other hotel. They comped me on my desert, since Stephanie had told them it was my birthday, and all in all, I had a wonderful time. I told her that i wanted to go see a Jazz or Blues show and she pointed me to the Backroom, a few blocks away from the hotel. She looked in her draw and found me a ticket for free entrance to the show (normally $20 at the door). The concert was great, and I was there for nearly 3 hrs, drinking and enjoying the music. The place is small, intimate, but the sound is great, so it is a good place to enjoy a show.Everyone at The Talbott was gracious, smiling and helpful. I felt like I was staying with family....I cannot explain it any other way. Every morning I would come down and chat with Stephanie for a few minutes about what I was doing that day, and she suggested other things that i might do also. It was like a well-choreographed show!!!The location is perfect, near to Rush Street and the bars, restaurants and stores, Michigan Avenue is about a block and a 1/2 away.....there are buses, free trolleys so there is no problem to get where you want to go.In my stay in Chicago I had purchased a few items that could not be packed in my carry-on, and so i asked Stephanie if the Hotel could arrange for the stuff to be sent via UPS to my home. No problem, she said. I gave them my address etc....and all was arranged. I received the items aboout 4 days later.I really was sorry to leave. It was such a wonderful experience. Time and time again while I was sitting with Stephanie other folk would come in and thank her for reservations she had made for them, recommendations for theatre, restaurants, walking tours, etc....and would turn to me while I was sitting there and tell me that they always come back to The Talbott because of her. Some brought in small gifts of their appreciation....I have never seen this at any other hotel I have stayed at.I have to say that I did initially have some trepidation when i booked this hotel. I was not familiar with smaller, boutique-styled hotels, but I was sooo pleasantly surprised that I would feel as if I betrayed them if I were to ever re-visit Chicago and not stay at The Talbott. My trip was that special. That, I can safely say, is the kind of experience that makes it very easy to return time and time again to a hotel.I can safely recommend The Talbott to anyone who is looking for a different type of hotel stay....one that does not revolve around a large, Business-type place (Hilton, Hyatt etc...not that I am knocking them). I cannot wait to return to the Talbott, I was that moved by my time there."
86,260,"May 31 2008 	Great small hotel fabulous location excellent service staff large rooms	We enjoyed the Talbott very much. Larger than average room and bathroom, comfortable bed, service staff well trained without being &quot;snooty.&quot; Fabulous location on Delaware, two blocks from Michigan Ave. The downstairs Bice Bistro was superb for every course, morning through late night and there is a Starbucks directly across the street. A small hotel with great charm. Will definitely stay here again."
87,260,"May 15 2008 	Very nice!	We were booked at the Talbott via Hotwire at a very good rate. We had some concerns after reading the reviews on tripadvisor, particularly about the construction noise.First, let me say the staff is outstanding, the rooms are beautiful and we would not hesitate staying there again. Stephanie, the concierge, is very, very good and made a huge impact on our stay. The hotel is relatively small but very, very upscale.Second, we found no more noise at the hotel than any other big city establishment. We were on the 11th floor and the construction was much higher and was not objectionable.Third, the location was perfect for us as we could walk to all the sights and restaurants. All the restauants on Rush St. are about a 3 block walk. Stephanie got us reservations at two marvelous spots. The Hancock Tower, where we enjoyed late night drinks, is also about a 3 block walk.The ONLY negative is you have to call room service to get ice. This is one nice hotel."
88,260,"Apr 30 2008 	Kudos to the staff--they couldn't be nicer	My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night at the tail end of our trip after 3 nights in the Hilton on South Michigan. For the price we paid (approx. $160 on Hotwire), we had an excellent stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property to anyone else. Compared to the Hilton, the room was probably 1.5 to 2 times as large, with a huge flat panel TV on the wall. The amenities were Aveda products, the room was clean, and the location (in the Gold Coast, only a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile and probably on 4 blocks to the closest El stop) was excellent. Most importantly, everyone we encountered--from the doorman to the belllman to the frontdesk clerk to the housecleaning staff-- were genuinely friendly and willing to accommodate us or answer our questions, Just one small example: we checked out of the Hilton at 11 am and took a cab to the Talbott. We just wanted to stow our bags so that we could grab something to eat, but were informed that if we were willing to wait 20 minutes or so, our room would be available! I thought our stay at the Hilton was adequate, but highly doubt we would have been able to check into our room at 11:30--and even if we could, I suspect they would have charged us for this privilege/convenience! (Mind you, the S. Michigan Hilton is happy to stow your bags for you--for only $2 per bag for the convenience. Look up other Tripadvisor reviews if you don't believe me!) Lastly, many of the reviews preceding mine complain about the construction noise, which we didn't encounter. (We were on the 15th floor, so that might have something to do with it.) So although there was a hellish amount of construction going on around and in front of the Talbott, the room itself seemed to be well insulated and caccooned off from any street noise. Again, I highly recommend this hotel. Our thanks go out especially to Jennifer and Perry for making our brief stay pleasant and enjoyable."
89,260,"Apr 23 2008	Great hotel but too much construction noise.	A fantastic hotel overall, with probably the best service that I've ever experienced. The huge drawback, however, is the construction that is occurring on both sides of the hotel. They generally work 8am - 8pm Mon-Sat (we stayed for a week) and one of the buildings had workers present on Sunday as well. This was not disclosed on any part of the website at the time of booking. This hotel will be perfect when the construction's done, though the doorman at the hotel when we left estimated that they'd be working for another 1-2 years."
90,260,"Mar 28 2008 	Good value and location--when the construction in the area is complete	I booked the Talbott Hotel for a two night stay in Chicago. I chose it because they offered the best rates for a 4 star hotel in the location I was looking for (convenient to shopping and dining). The positives: a nice staff, large rooms, clean and well maintained. The negatives: major construction taking place immediately next door to the hotel--sleeping past 7 a.m. was not possible and needless to say, my three teens did not like this at all. When I booked my reservation, I had inquired about construction noise and was told that it was not a factor anymore and that they had not received any comments/complaints from guests about the noise. I would not hesitate to stay here when construction is complete. It's not hip, fancy or luxurious, but charming and well-located at a price that represents a fair value--when the construction is complete."
91,260,"Mar 24 2008	Second time Around	We stayed at the Talbott in February. I wrote a review but it wasn't listed. I wonder why? Fine hotel but there is construction next door that runs 6 days a week - 8am-8pm, with noisy consturciton elevators running 12 hours a day and bright lights on 24/7. Avoid until the construction is over. Then, it will be a very nice place to stay."
92,260,"Mar 17 2008	Great place to stay	We just got back from a 3 night stay at the Talbott hotel in Chicago. We had booked this through Hotwire so we didn't know we were staying here until after we had purchased through Hotwire. This was a great place to stay! I knew we had one of the smaller rooms - which was a Deluxe King room. But, once we walked into our room we saw that it was very spacious for a regular room. Very nice and updated decor, and everything was extremely clean. The first 2 nights we hardly saw any other guests in the hotel. Seemed like we had the place to ourselves which was a nice relief from the busy Chicago streets. I read others' complaints about the noise of construction next to the hotel which made me nervous since I'm a light sleeper. While we did see the construction, I never heard any of it - and we slept in most mornings until 9:30 or so. I read that the suites in the hotel had jacuzzi tubs, and I knew we didn't have one in ours as we had a regular room. However, the tub was very deep and great for soaking! (Might I add, this was the cleanest hotel tub I've seen in a long time!) We had a wonderful time staying here and the staff was wonderful and friendly. My husband did have one complaint - though the bed was comfortable, the down comforter on the bed wasn't long enough to cover his feet. His not extremely tall, about 6'0. So, that made sleeping a bit rougher on him, but overall we loved our stay!"
93,260,"Mar 12 2008 	Wonderful get away in Chicago	We have just returned from a weekend getaway at The Talbott Hotel. We were just thrilled with our decision to stay at The Talbott. The room was very comfortable and spotless. Everything seems to have been recently updated. The bed was especially comfortable with a down comforter. The location of the hotel itself allowed us to walk to a wide variety of restaurants and easy access to shopping at Water Tower and Michigan Avenue. The staff were all very friendly and informative. We were greeted with warm smiles and greetings every time. One concern is the dim lighting in the bathroom. Applying makeup and putting in contacts was easy however due to the lighted makeup mirror with a swing arm. The only other warning is the construction next door. We were on the 8th floor and the little noise we heard was not a problem. However, the construction was still on the ground level. In the next year or so, I would make sure to contact the hotel to determine which side of the hotel is noisy or not. Otherwise, we would recommend this as an intimate, well done hotel. I am sure we will be back in the future!"
94,260,"Mar 8 2008	Not Sure Why It's So Highly Rated	We booked a room at the Talbott in March, and I honestly don't understand what the attraction is. The staff was great--extremely friendly and accommodating. However, the rooms are small and nondescript, and the neighborhood is a construction zone, so it was incredibly noisy. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
95,260,"Mar 6 2008 	Reliable Hotel Great Location	Our family stayed at the Talbott for a long weekend visiting family in Chicago. While the dark, psuedo English decor is not my taste, we found the hotel to be a great choice at a fair price. We loved the location and could walk to the Hancock tower, Michigan Avenue etc. Navy Pier was a $10 cab ride.The staff at the hotel are amazing. They helped get reservations that were impossible to get. They took packages. They delivered extra beds immediately.The hotel is connected to the restaurant BICE so the room service was great if priced for that type of high end restaurant. Breakfast was also delivered in 20 minutes which is unusual these days.The room was large. The bathroom had a tub and a stand alone shower. More importantly, it had Aveda products.We would stay here again."
96,260,"Feb 1 2008 	The Best!	I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks. I was very pleased with every facet of my stays. The staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. The rooms were nicely sized and clean, and well stocked. I will return to the Talbott anytime!"
97,260,Jan 19 2008 	One of the Best Hotel Staffs you'll find in Chicago	After reading reviews on several websites I decided to book a room at the Talbott during one of the coldest times of the year. It was well worth it! From the second we arrived it was clear that the entire staff was hand picked and thoroughly trained to be warm and friendly. From the bellman to front desk to the maintenance man in the elevator....they all took time to say good morning and have a great day. That type of service is no accident. This place really was more than I expected for the price. Our suite was large and comfortable. The bathroom had a separate shower and the bath accessories were top notch. The hotel offers free morning coffee in the lobby but there is also a Starbucks right around the corner and everything worth seeing along the Mag Mile is within a short walk. I would stay there again. This is my first review submitted to Trip Advisor and I am doing this almost a year after my stay. I felt obligated to give credit where credit is due! This hotel felt more like a 5 star hotel than several of the 5 star hotels I have stayed at.
98,260,"Jan 4 2008 	Great Hotel Fantastic Location	December 30 to 31 (not over New Year's eve). Our room rate was less than $140 booking through the hotel's reservations - this was a good deal for Chicago. Friendly staff, nicely decorated hotel and large size room (1409 corner King room). We arrived around 11:30 in the morning and SURPRISE, our room was READY!!!! Wow! That has Never happened before at any other hotel. This is a quaint boutique hotel located very close to Water Tower Place and the John Hancock building a stone's throw from the famous Magnificent Mile! About 5 blocks from the river (not a terrible walk if it's not too cold!).Rooms were recently redecorated (hotel style, but nice) and our bathroom had double sinks and a jacuzzi tub. Nice. Some negatives: Did not have have a flat panel TV and the TV was too small for the room size (since our room was so large, the TV was about 20 feet to the headboard!) The mini stereo/CD/Clock radio was cheap and made a funny burping sound when the music hit low notes (we were listening to jazz!) Another thing missing from this boutique hotel was a little complimentary wine and cheese around the cocktail hour.I would recommend this hotel to about $220 range, anything more I would be disappointed (see negative points)."
99,260,"Jan 1 2008 	The Talbott is lovely	This is a lovely small hotel in a great location. The staff is exceptionally gracious and helpful. The little restaurant-bar (Bice's) is exquisite, and its cocktails, wines, food, and service are excellent. The dark wood paneling throughout the common areas is warm and cozy. The theme of fox-hunting in the artwork is unfortunate, though, for those (like me) who find this &quot;sport&quot; barbaric."
100,260,"Dec 14 2007	Great Experience	Stayed here for two nights, we were upgraded upon arrival to the executive suites. The room was huge if a little dark, howver the huge comfy bed and aveda products made up for it.Perfect location however found room service to be very pricey."
101,260,"Dec 4 2007	disappointed	I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it. This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed. The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again.Other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer, there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee (so you couldn't walk out with the coffee) and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay.The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm, including weekends."
102,260,"Nov 13 2007 	Charming and plush and wonderful location	I booked last minute at the Talbott while in Chicago, and was very happy with my stay and services. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the concierge with directions and recommendations. I stayed in a double queen-bed room, which was huge by traditional hotel room standards. The carpet was plush, the bed comfortable, and the other amenities quite thoughtful (such as umbrellas in the room just in case). Aveda bath products were also a nice touch. One caution: there is a large construction site next to the hotel, so rooms facing that side will be noisy after 8:00 a.m. most mornings. The front desk staff was accommodating though and offered to move me if the noise was too much.I would highly recommend this hotel, and definitely would stay there again."
103,260,Nov 13 2007 	Best in the city	This hotel is a classic - richly appointed and has the friendliest most helpfui staff I've ever encountered. Can't wait to get back.
104,260,"Nov 5 2007 	Great Hotel	Chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. Some friends suggested trying The Talbott. I'm delighted we took them up. The Talbott is a great &quot;small&quot; hotel a block and a half off of Michigan Avenue near the Four Seasons, Drake and Westin.The concierge staff was most helpfull. Gene and Stephanie took great care of us.The rooms were spacious and very fresh. The elevators could be a bit slow at times. Aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect.Bice now runs the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed having breakfast there.We will stay there again."
105,260,"Oct 30 2007	Supurb Boutique Hotel AWESOME location authentic connected service	OK, I love visiting the most friendly, clean, delightful city in the world,Chicago. I am hooked on this gem of a city, I wish my business would transfer me here, but if they did THEN I couldn't just visit this wonderful hotel smack in the center of the action, like coming home, delightful. Just a snidge off the main beam of Michigan Ave. wonderfulness, so the location is quiet yet steps to everything. From the doormen (thank you Charles and Perry) to the concierge (many thanks to Gene and Stephanie) to the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone is genuinely caring about the guest. I am over the top for this hotel and would give it a TripAdvisor #10 if the rating was available. The rates are in synch with the area, even if a bit high (sigh), well, whataya gonna do? The rooms are lovely, the amenities deep, the beds firm, the service top notch. This should be your choice. I have my cheerleader pom poms out for the Talbott. Woohoooo!"
106,260,"Oct 24 2007	Excellent boutique hotel	Although The Talbott may seem expensive it gives full value and is in a very good location. Our Deluxe Corner King room was spacious and excellent quality and the hotel and its staff are very welcoming, efficient and friendly. We would certainly stay there again."
107,260,Oct 23 2007	Friendly staff beautiful hotel in heart of Downtown Chicago	The reservationists are rude on the phone but when I arrived at the hotel the staff was very accommodating and friendly. My room was HUGE and absolutely beautiful. The hotel is located in a very convenient location where every restaurant and sights are from walking distance. Two thumbs up!
108,260,"Oct 13 2007 	A fine choice	The Talbott is a boutique hotel in the Gold Coast part of Chicago. It is just a few blocks from Hancock Tower, Watertower Place, and Michigan Avenue. It is a little North of some points of interest, such as the Navy Pier or the Art Institute, requiring 20 - 30 min of walking to get to these sites or ~$12 dollar cab ride.The hotel itelf is very attractive and personal. The decor is traditional, with tasteful prints and furniture. (For some reason, the Talbott is big on fox huning themes). The rooms are large and comfortable. I stayed in a one room suite, which was very spacious, well-decorated, and very clean. The size and layout was ideal in terms of privacy, in that a family can place 1 - 2 people in the living room, which is separated from the bedroom by the sizable bathroom suite. Other features of the hotel include free WiFi (which was a little buggy), and a restaurant.Overall, this a is fine, personal hotel that makes it a good alternative to the large hotels in the area. One possible issue is that a major building is being constructed immediately behind the Talbott. Work begins at 7:30 am, so noise could be a problem for those wanting to sleep-in or grab a mid-day nap. However, this is probably a short-term issue, and I recommend the Talbott highly."
109,260,"Oct 1 2007 	The Talbott is great!!!	My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday 9/29. We all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The staff from top to bottom were excellent, accommodating. The room was roomy...with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. The construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk, but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. The doorman, Andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. He arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. The hotel was expensive but met expectations."
110,260,"Oct 1 2007 	Nice rooms service not always	The rooms in the Talbott are good, large and recently refurbished. The WiFi internet is good and free of charge. The staff is not always as friendly as they should be, but overall this stay was nice. The location is great, just of Michigan Ave."
111,260,"Sep 17 2007 	One of the worst hotels I've stayed at	I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at the. The receptionist up front was a snooty, sarcastic teenager or post teenager. You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. The room was dirty, stains on the carpet, the showerhead was moldy and rusted, the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. The towels had a horrible aroma. The hotel is very narrow, so we were near a construction zone so, I would plan on waking up at 6:am if you choose the Talbott. The next day, I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day, if were not out by noon. I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. Please stay away from this hotel, I think a Holiday Inn would be better.Andrew F. Gulli"
112,260,"Sep 15 2007 	Nice Boutique Hotel in the Gold Coast	The Talbott is a real nice boutique hotel right in the heart of the Gold Coast, one of the nicest neighborhoods in Chicago, and about 1.5 blocks from the Magnificent Mile. The lobby finishes and the staff were very friendly, and appeared to be accomidating. We didn't really need anything, but if we did, we could have asked anybody, and they would have helped us. The room well apointed, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and has a timed heater function, that can be used in the bitter Chicago winter mornings. The location of the hotel is increadible. You are two blocks from the Red Line &quot;L&quot; train that runs all hours of the day. You are 2 blocks from The Bloomingdales building, John Hancock Building, Water Tower, and all the shops on Michigan Avenue. You are by great restaurants, shopping, and transportation.This hotel is a good deal for the location and accomidations. I would definetly recommend this hotel; however, read the WARNING BELOW:******WARNING********There are 3 major constructions occuring to the west, and north of the building. Construction is at the early stages of this property, but in the coming year(s), major construction will occur, and it will be right next door to the hotel. We were on the 13th floor (lucky), but we heard very faint construction, Tuesday moring. My big suggestion, would be to get a high floor room, and by around next year at this time, be warned of major construction at this location."
113,260,"Sep 3 2007 	2nd time just as great as 1st	My 2nd stay at the Talbott within a year and it was just as great as the first time. Was in a standard 2 full bed bedroom for 3 people. Room was a big size. bathroom was nice. desk and easy chair as well. 4th floor yet was bright and airy. Front desk was great, concierge very helpful and resourceful. Great location; a block from John Hancock building as well as miracle mile with all the shopping. Price can not be beat. down the street 4 seasons charges 500+ for a room while we paid 200 for the night. New restaurant on premises (Bice ) which looked great. Have stayed in Talbott 1 br king suite and that was wonderful but couch in separate living room is not a pull out. I will certainly make this my chicago hotel. around the corner have breakfast at El Tempo (best breakfasts) or Eisnstein bagel a block away. Hotel is so central. Enjoy, we did"
114,260,"Aug 27 2007 	Perfect Hotel!!	We booked a double room suite, the size was like an apartment, the bathroom was huge and the hotel has an excellent location, we have all the restaurants and shopping two blocks away."
115,260,"Aug 26 2007 	The Talbott was a Treat!	Great staff, quiet, and well appointed room. Walking distance from great shopping!"
116,260,"Aug 21 2007 	Treasure in Chicago	If you are looking for a delightful, small hotel in the heart of Chicago, The Talbott is for you. It is a perfect location and a true hideaway from the chaotic city. We had a standard room and it was very large. The bathrooms are small, but that comes with an older hotel. The beds were awesome as was the maid service. The staff was excellent...always helpful and attentive...we all loved the bellmen! The only complaint would be that the bar closes very early....sometimes before 11PM."
117,260,"Aug 9 2007 	The Best Place to turn 30!!!!	We stayed at the Talbott from the 4th-7th of August and it was wonderful. We were steps from several streets that had tons to do. We also bought 3 day bus passes and just jumped on and off around town seeing and doing everything we could pack in 4 full days. Gene at the concierge desk checked us in for our flight before we got to the airport on our way out, he booked us reservations to restaurants, gave us an umbrella when it started to rain, held our bags when we checked out as we had a late flight so we wondered around town some more, and he gave us directions to this place and that place. Our room was always clean and they put my flowers in the room that arrived for my birthday from a friend. We love to travel and go to new places trying not to repeat trips as we all know so much to do and see out there, but I would go back to the Talbott and especially Chicago. Everyone was super nice and super informative. Although do not eat at the place in the hotel, way overpriced and not that wonderful, nor was our waiter or the wrestling on the TV. If you need great places to eat, Quartinos on State ask for Zach he was awesome, great for lunch as it gets really crowded at dinner, Devon we went to late and it is super nice and the food is terrific, Kitchs'n on Chicago, way down Chicago, they have soy lattes, i was sooooooooo happy, it is in the same place as Japonaise which is also wonderful and beautiful, do not go on a weekend to japonaise way too crowded. we went on a monday night and it still got really crowded but we were already there when the crowd rolled in at 7pm plus they have a beautiful bar downstairs, order all appetizers so you can try everything. Giordanos on Michigan and Superior (get there at 1045am walk to the bar and order your pizza as it takes 45 min to cook so when you sit down at 11 you can eat a salad or something then your pizza comes and you will not be waiting in line for 2 hours like everyone else, i recommened the stuffed spinach if you just like your pizza easy cheese instead of overly cheesy), if you want a specialty coffee shop the only one i found in the city is Cafe Deluca on Damen in Wiker Park everything else is a starbucks. The people were nice and it is very Austin, Texas the entire area. Hope this was helpful. Check out the free trolleys, stained glass museum (navy Pier), botanical garden and zoo (lincoln Park), millienium park, beach, etc. I LOVE CHICAGO!!! If you go in August like we did take extra shorts, i wore jeans thinking it would be lots cooler than Texas, wrong. :-)"
118,260,"Jul 5 2007 	Great night at the Talbott	My girlfriend and I live in Chicago but decided to play tourists for a night and stay at a hotel downtown. The Talbott was wonderful. It's in a great location -- about 2 blocks from the John Hancock and just steps from Rush Street. The room was clean. The bed was comfy. The Aveda shower products were a nice touch, as was the free wireless Internet. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The doorman downstairs informed us that we could get a couple bucks off parking at a nearby garage by getting a validation ticket at the front desk. We were impressed that he helped us out even though we had decided to park the car ourselves rather than using the hotel's valet service.After taking a shower, I discovered that the hair dryer in our bathroom wasn't working. I called downstairs and they immediately sent up an engineer to check out the problem. Upon discovering that the dryer was, indeed, broken, he immediately fetched another one for me. The entire process -- from the time I phoned the front desk -- took about 15 minutes. It was quick, easy, and again, very friendly.I would absolutely recommend the hotel to anyone looking to stay in the River North/Gold Coast area."
119,260,"Jun 29 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June 22nd and I decided to tag along for the shopping! We flew into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. Everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. We were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. The room was clean and spacious enough for us. The bed is very comfy. We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. The location of this hotel is perfect. You are about 1&amp;1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower. Can't beat that! There is also an adorable pet store called Tails In The City across from the hotel! I brought our dog back a couple of toys! They are very nice as well. All in all, no complaints. The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. The staff is always friendly and the location is superb. It's a safe neighborhood-I walked around by myself and felt fine. We would definitely return."
120,260,"Jun 17 2007 	Perfect place to stay	My boyfriend and I just returned from our second stay at The Talbott. It was wonderful to see the same friendly staff and they welcomed us with kind words, good service, and efficient checkin.Our room was an executive king suite (701)- roomy, great beds and bedding and an incredibly large bathroom. The bathroom had 2 sinks and large tub and separate shower. The only thing not so great were the livingroom chairs (very uncomfortable) and outdated televisions. However, we were told that new flat screens have been ordered. The maid service was efficient and rooms were very clean.I tried the complimentary pass to the fitness club which was only a 5 minute walk from hotel. I recommend it. We did not eat at the hotel nor did we try room service but I am sure it would be great as the restaurant was always busy and the food did look yummy.The concierge staff was extremely helpful and made reservations and suggestions for us, etc.We love this hotel for its location and understated elegance among all the other reasons I have mentioned."
121,260,"Jun 7 2007 	Classy 	Mid-May my husband and I stayed at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago for 3 nights. It was awesome! The hotel's website does not reflect how beautiful and stylish it is. I have attached our pictures so you can understand. The rooms have been updated and are gorgeous, elegant, and sparkling clean. I told the front desk that they have to update their website! It does not reflect the hotel at all. We had booked a regular king room and when we arrived we found out we had been upgraded to a suite! The suite was huge! Practically the size of our apartment in DC!Again the rooms are newly refurbished. We had a beautiful bedroom with European, old world style furnishings, a living room, and the most amazing bathroom with 2 sinks, a shower, and soaking hot tub. Even though there was construction going on we never heard a thing! They have really good, thick windows.The hotel is in a really fun part of Chicago called the &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. There are tons of cool shops and restaurants all within the blocks of the hotel. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile and river. We never used it but they give you complimentary passes to a nearby gym. We had the buffet breakfast in the charming bistro. The lobby is really warm and inviting and the staff fabulous and professional.I totally recommend The Talbott Hotel!"
122,260,"Jun 3 2007 	sweet home in chicago	We bookended a recent trip to Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan with two visits to Chicago, where we stayed both times at the small but elegant Talbott Hotel. I'd never heard of the hotel before, but booked it following reviews on this site. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The hotel staff are friendly and welcoming; the accommodations more than ample, boasting top quality bed linens and nicely appointed baths throughout. On our first stay we were given a complimentary upgrade to a luxurious Executive King; room 1202 was spacious and airy, with a particularly nice bath which included a lighted makeup mirror, Aveda toiletries, his and her bathrobes and separate bath and shower. On our return stay we were given a Double Queen, which too was large and pleasant, with a slightly less opulent bathroom (single shower/bath) but delightful nevertheless. There is construction going on next door, but we never heard a bit of it. Everyone on staff is cheerful and gracious, and the hotel's Bice Bistro makes both a nice place for breakfast and a lively spot for a nightcap. I don't believe we'll be staying anywhere else when we're in town ~ we've found our home away from home. And of course, they have that cow climbing up the side of the building. You don't get that at the Four Seasons."
123,260,"May 30 2007 	Wonderful Experience	Merritt Island, FloridaMy mother-in-law and I stayed at The Talbott May 25-28. It has a great location just down the road from the Hancock building. Tons of shopping and restaurants close by. If you are inclined to walk you can go a few blocks to the Drake hotel and follow the underpass to the lake and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Be aware the next place to cross back over is at the Navy Pier. The hotel rooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was extremely courteous and knowledgable.Beware of the WhiteHall hotel down the road. I'll write another review on that!!!"
124,260,"May 29 2007 	Everything we could have wanted from The Talbott!!	My husband and I just returned from a fantastic, three night trip to Chicago and loved every minute at The Talbott! The location was fantastic - we walked to every meal and shopping location. The staff was unsurpassed! They couldn't have been more helpful. The concierge staff secured our dinner reservations and made many helpful suggestions. The hotel was well appointed with beautiful rooms and bathrooms. Everything was immaculate and very charming. We loved the little bistro tables that lined the street - great for relaxing and 'people watching&quot; before we ventured out for dinner.We will certainly stay at the Talbott next time we visit Chicago. We wouldn't change a thing about our experience!"
125,260,"May 19 2007 	Wonderful personalized service at The Talbott Hotel	My mother and I stayed at the Talbott Hotel May 14-18. The entire experience was extremely enjoyable. The hotel staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful and spacious with lots of storage areas. It was very quiet, clean and comfortable. The location of the Talbott is convenient to Michigan Ave, boutiques, and restaurants. I will return to the Talbott Hotel whenever I visit Chicago and hope to find some of the same wonderful staff."
126,260,"Apr 30 2007 	Great Choice!	My husband and I stayed from April 27 to April 29th. It was my first trip to the city. This was a terrific location - it was close to great shopping and good restaurants. I could not have chosen better. The staff were all very helpful - all around a good choice. I would stay again. Ask for GENE at the conceirge desk - you'll be lucky if he's on - he was terrific, a real pleasure, very helpful. A few things however to be aware of - there is a lot of construction going on opposite the hotel so the room we had (very clean by the way with comfy beds) overlooked the construction site and they do work on Saturdays and Sundays. Now we weren't bothered as we head out early in the morning but something to be aware of. We booked online - make sure you check the rates regularily. I had booked at $309 per night but then checked a week or so later and the rate went down to $209 per night so I cancelled and rebooked at the lesser rate. However - still a great hotel and would recommend."
127,260,"Apr 17 2007	Excellent in every way	We have stayed in the finest resorts and hotels in various locations throughout the United States both on business and pleasure trips. This hotel is absolutely the best overall property of any. The concierge staff, particularly Stephanie, are genuinely interested in being helpful in a sincere, friendly manner. They are well informed and eager to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel is immaculately maintained. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was obviously designed by a woman! There are countless little touches that make you want to go home and re-do your own bathroom! The hotel is centrally located and incredibly quiet. They even provide delicious, really fresh fruit in a bowl in the lobby! We can't wait to go back there."
128,260,"Apr 10 2007 	upscale quality downscale price	We stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer. Gibson's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple. This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago. It should also have more than three stars. I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. Depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it."
129,260,"Apr 3 2007	My favorite hotel	Always a delight. Have stayed several times, the latest this past weekend3/21-4/2/07 and I am always glad to return. If you are looking for a small, personal hotel where the entire staff treats you special then this is the place to stay. Our children who range from 6-16 love it even if there's no pool!!!"
130,260,"Mar 16 2007	Spring Break Base	Stayed 5 nights at this great hotel. Updated rooms. Clean. Used Tim to book theater and dinning reservations. Provided excellent service. Close to subway, shopping and dinning. Excellent value. Free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks. Highly recommend it. Future concern is adjacent construction of condos. Not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future."
131,260,"Mar 3 2007 	Great Place to Stay	My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. This little hotel was the perfect place for us. The lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. The bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. There was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us.Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location. We were only a few steps from State, Rush, and North Michigan. Tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in.We highly recommend the Talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips."
132,260,"Mar 2 2007	Great surprise at the Talbott	After hearing my second daughter from college was meeting us in Chicago, we needed a roll away in our suite we had booked at another hotel . After being told we were not allowed to have one, we started looking for another hotel and came across the Talbott on the Orbitz web site. It looked great and was in the best location, but I must say I was skeptical as to the price and the pictures shown of the room. I really doubted they would be as nice as they looked on line. What a great surprise! The suite was beautiful! It was so large that you could have a full living room and still have room for 2 roll-aways if needed. It was clean, it was newly done over. The location couldn't be better and the staff was the most courteous and bent over backwards to be helpful. I will return to the Talbott anytime I have to return to Chicago. It definitely is the best place in Chicago for the money!"
133,260,"Feb 11 2007 	Excellent hotel	I only had one night in Chicago - and a cold one it was too! However, the Talbott hotel kept me warm and comfortable. The room was large but nice and warm and the bed was excellent - general accomodation was superb and room service was pretty decent. The staff were extremely helfpul and pleasant - and not forced. Will more than happily stay there again next time I am in Chicago"
134,260,"Jan 20 2007	Europe in Chicago	As we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said &quot;We picked the right place.&quot; Having chosen the Talbott from other Trip Advisor reviews I found myself thinking in terms of a Trip Advisor review when we arrived. Nice entrance, friendly reception, I noticed everything and immediately knew the Talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. The smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of Europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. The location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the Art Institute, Rush Street, the Theater District, and we're from California where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! All I can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the Talbott. Oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet."
135,260,Jan 18 2007 	Hotel and staff wonderful	My wife and I and our three teen age children spent a long weekend at the Talbott and had a great time. We had a room with two queen beds that was a nice size and were able to add a roll away bed without being too cramped. The conceriege was great with excellent tips on restaurants and other activities. Easy walk to shopping and also took the subway (a short walk away) to the Bears game. I felt it was reasonably priced and very nice.
136,260,"Jan 8 2007 	Bring Earplugs.	In a word - NOISY. A new hotel is being constructed out back. They start at 8 a.m. sharp and don't end until late at night. Every Day. I'd wait until it's done before staying there. If you only need one bed, they can move your room to the front of the hotel where it's not as bad. If you need more than one bed, though, you're out of luck.The hotel is nice, restaurant has very good food and otherwise the stay was fine."
137,260,"Dec 25 2006 	Superb service	What a nice experience with a warm and friendly staff, comfortable and clean rooms, and great beds. Even the Aveda bath products were top shelf. Only complaint parking pricey but it is the Big City so no real surprise. Would absolutely stay again!"
138,260,"Nov 25 2006	Cozy Classy Super value	The Talbott is a really nice hotel and a great value. Located on a quaint street, and a block up from the Four Seasons you are in the heart of great shopping and restuarants. The rooms are well appointed and impeccably clean, bathroom is a bit wee in size but the robes and Aveda products make up for it. This is a boutique hotel so it's small and cozy. The staff was very pleasant and helpful too. I say it beats any name-brand hotel, especially given the location and price. I would go back."
139,260,"Nov 11 2006 	An Outstanding Hotel in a Big City	I stayed at the Talbott for 18 days while working at a tradeshow at McCormick Place. I was a little worried - being assigned to a smaller hotel - you just never know - you really have to trust the reviews. Boy was I thrilled. The hotel is on a tree lined street, within a half block of the Four Seasons (that tells you the neighborhood is in fact nice). The best part of Magnificient Mile is two short blocks away - you can see Michigan Avenue from the hotel. The doorman greets you as you arrive. There was one present almost 24 hours a day.When you walk in, there is a small lobby, with a living room style seating area on each side with a fireplace. You immediately get a cozy feeling. I had arrived very early the day of the Chicago Marathon, it was cold, and I was wet from the rain - they got me a room within an hour (was sold out the night before so they really rushed).I had an executive king - a very large room with a huge bathroom with a seperate tub and shower. Aveeda soaps, etc. All the furnishings were new - in good shape, soft bedding and nice carpet. I asked if they had a small refrigerator since I would be there so long, and they brought me one along with a microwave. Day in and day out the service was excellent. From the doorman to the concierge, to the maid, everyone was very pleasant and helpful. One of the front desk attendants knew I liked bananas, and when she was on duty, made sure the fruit bowl with the apples and oranges had bananas also. There was a beautiful but small bar - with gorgeous wood. I was mostly too tired to ever go in. There was fresh coffee - complimentary - each morning, along with the fruit.If I had to nit pick - there are some areas in the hallway to the rooms that could use some touch up paint - after being hit repeatedly by the luggage cart. The food could have been better too, I never ate it, but both my work mates declared it could be better - but I always went out - around the corner to some great Italian food at Pizano's or the other many restaurants on Rush. I rarely eat at hotels - the local food is too good to pass up and since this hotel is so close to everything you can walk out, and turn towards any direction and find good restaurants and shops.This hotel is for people who like small intimate settings, cozy, one on one service with people who remember your name and who don't need loud bars and restaurants, etc. I travel for a living and prefer this style of hotel - I want a quiet place, upscale furnishings and great service. The Talbott delivers. We had almost 50 staff in from all over the country, and the hotel booking service had us in about 10 different hotels. Based on what everyone said about their hotel, and the many I saw when visiting others over the three weeks, I know the Talbott was superior! If I don't get to stay there again the next time, I will be disappointed!I fell in love with Chicago and the Talbott Hotel!"
140,260,"Nov 6 2006 	Great Little Hotel	This hotel would have received an &quot;excellent&quot; review from me if we didn't have to wait 45 min. (after check-in time) to get our room. HOWEVER - since we were made to wait they upgraded us to a suite! It was fabulous! HUGE room, HUGE bathroom, COMFORTABLE bed &amp; linens, and super CLEAN to boot!The location is great - not spectacular - but it's difficult to get a spectacular location in such a big city with so much to do. It is WAY NORTH so if you want to do anything by the Art Institute/MillenniumPark - or anything south of those places - it's quite a hike if you're walking, but a short cab ride if you're not.It is close to great restaurants and shopping. The valet guys were most helpful, friendly &amp; efficient. The front desk - uh...not so much. They have a nice bar just outside of the lobby (i believe the restaurant is located around the bar but we did not eat there and I didn't really &quot;look around&quot; that area). The elevators are small and slow...not a very big deal...they have stairs too.If you are looking for a nice, relatively inexpensive (for the city), small hotel in a quite area of the city (and I use the word &quot;quiet&quot; in city terms) this is the place for you! We'll definitley be back."
141,260,Oct 6 2006	Great Stay	I recently stayed at the Talbott. At first I was a little apprehensive because some of the reviews rated the service poor. I thought the service was great. Everyone was very nice and actually went out of their way to be helpful. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. and did not have a problem checking in early (2 rooms). They actually upgraded both rooms. The rooms were very clean. I have nothing but good things to say about The Talbott. It is a great value (we paid $199 per night)
142,260,"Sep 18 2006	Great experience - except for the front desk	Just spent the weekend at the Talbott. Loved the location - close to everything - as well as the decor of the hotel. The rooms were great, the beds super-comfortable and the service was on the whole, excellent. The older doorman with the great smile was always extremely friendly and helpful as was the young man who was the concierge while we were there. Unfortunately, our dealings with Anna, a young woman at the front desk, put a damper on our weekend but all in all, the experience was a great one and very much worth the money. I would strongly recommend this hotel."
143,260,Sep 15 2006 	Great hotel!	My husband and love this hotel! We had made our reservations in the spring and at the last minute we decided we would like to add a night. When I called the hotel they were more than helpful. We stopped into the bar after a night on the town and had a very pleasant time. The staff was wonderful. We will definitely stay here again.
144,260,"Sep 4 2006	What a great hotel!	Don't believe the unfortunate reviews from August--this hotel is wonderful! My family and I (husband and two daughters) just returned from a weekend getaway to Chicago. The hotel is exactly as advertised--but even nicer (how about that!). We went to New York City for spring break this year, and to Europe in June--but our girls thought this was the nicest hotel we've stayed at! The room had two queen beds and was unbelievably spacious. The bathroom was beautiful--tile and granite, with two sinks and a lighted makeup mirror. Housekeeping does a great job, too--everything was so clean.The staff was very friendly and outgoing--even the doorman and the maids said hello and greeted us with a smile. The staff was very helpful, too--any question or request was promptly addressed. We were even able to get to Sunday Mass with easy directions and a current schedule of Masses. The location is perfect--just a few blocks from Michigan Avenue. We never took a taxi, nor any type of transportation. We walked walked walked all day and evening--and felt very safe and comfortable. Great hotel and great stay. I would highly recommend The Talbott and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.Thanks for a super weekend!"
145,260,"Aug 16 2006 	Terrible Talbott	I am not much of a complainer, as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site, but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago:My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006. The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. The receptionist was outright rude, but took the reservation without a mistake. During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent, the waiters, the managers, nobody was friendly, nor tied to accommodate us.[------------------------]We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hours party. The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. When we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. Nobody told us, we cant do anything for you. Are you sure that you arranged this? Two quotes so typical for this hotels staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again.I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]"
146,260,"Aug 15 2006 	Talbott was great for anniversary weekend	My wife and I loved the Talbott for our anniversary. It is a smaller hotel, but it was perfect for us. We were upgraded for free to a corner room with a decent view. There was construction outside our window, but could still see the city. The staff was great for us, we requested bath robes and they were there when we got back from dinner hanging in the bathroom. The bathroom was amazing by the way. The location is great too, just a block or two from the hancock building and Michigan Avenue. Some great little shops and stores right close too. We actually walked all the way down past the river and came back to the Navy Pier and never used a cab or drove. Its a fairly long walk to the river walk, but worth it. Parking was easy: $27 a night though. I will definately stay here again if I get the chance. The bad reviews sound like just unfortunate situations, the hotel itself is great so don't base your decision on reviews like that. For a romantic stay, this is a great place."
147,260,"Aug 9 2006	Avoid The Talbot	Avoid The Talbot, especially for group functions. My in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. They were lured in by promises from The Talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide &quot;special, personal treatment&quot;. Nothing could have been further from the truth. They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. Now the worse part. Mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. Case in point: I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. Of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. My brother recalls the &quot;indignation&quot; of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. Then Another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. When I finally was able to get across town, leaving a Cubs game early, I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. Again they agreed, but never did anything about it. In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from &quot;unathorized overuse&quot;. The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling The Talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that &quot;I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters&quot;.... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that I was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. In the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. The communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant.Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests.Try The Ambassador East (same neighborhood) cheaper, much more professional staff."
148,260,"Jul 30 2006	Bait and Switch	We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay. After checking in and unpacking, we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed (supposedly during renovation). The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room. Colleen, one of the managers, was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem. We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed. We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently &quot;absent from the hotel&quot; during most of our stay. We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence. We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology. The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident, as was the cavalier attitude of the management."
149,260,"Jul 11 2006	Thought the Talbott was great	I'm a fairly frequent recreation traveler and like nice, unique hotes. My criteria for Chicago was a smaller, independent, upscale hotel in a great location. The Talbott definitely fit the bill. The rooms were extremly spacious (we had 2), well appointed and very clean. The bathroom had two sinks, a phone, a very good shower and nice amenities. The beds were very, very comfortable with nice linens. The desk staff (except for one) was extremly helpful and courteous. Even the bellmen went out of their way to be helpful. It is located just two blocks off of Michigan Avenue and was perfect for launching our day yet quiet at night. We did not take an upper floor room with a more interesting view but as long a a room is quiet at night, I'm pretty happy. There is a lovely restaurant that has an outdoor cafe. We just grabbed breakfast there one morning...the other morning we went to Walkers Original Pancake House just 2-3 short blocks away. The morning that I did have breakfast, I was in a rush and they made sure that i was waited on promply and my order came out in a timely manner. There is plenty of shopping, restaurants, bars, etc all around the hotel and the conceirge, Tim, was very helpful in directing us to our destinations or making reservations. There is another concierge who we encountered twice, who I could have done without. While she did did help me, there was always this sense that she was going out of her way to do so. Everything else, I thought, was well above average for a hotel in that price range. When I think back to making our reservation, even the hotel reservaton agent was excellent. Good job Talbott!"
150,260,"Jun 8 2006	Lovely Boutique Hotel	Just back from a weekend stay at Chicago's Talbot Hotel and we all awarded it high marks for location, ambiance and service. It's locaction between Rush and State streets is ideal just a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile, the John Hancock Center and the WaterTower which is a great stop for tourist information and for picking up the Hop on Hop off bus.It has great curb appeal with a lovely outdoor dining area - all cheery yellow tablecloths and cafe umbrellas. We had a great alfresco breakfast, Nutella and banana crepes.Like most boutique hotels the lobby is small but it's charming - lots of leather couches and antiques ( including a score of French horns) and sort of an English Club look and feel. Great lobby bar but terrible Cosmopolitans and the house wines need to be upgraded.Our room was clean, attractive,very spacious and with two large windows it was flooded with sunshine.The bathroom was a decent size with double sink, a make-up mirror (my favorite amenity) and Aveda toiliteries. The bathtub was a bit shabby and the water pressure didn;t allow for an invigorating shower. No complaints on the beds - comfortable enough.We found the service to be good despite a glitch at check-in. Gene the conciegre was so accomodating and delivered great advice and some terrific dinner reservations on Saturday nightWe'll return."
151,260,May 18 2006	Very Pleasant	My daughter and I stayed at the hotel from May 7 through May 10th. After we were checked in we were introduced to Stephanie the concierge. She gathered information from us about our trip and directed us on things to do. Stephanie you're great. We had a corner King and it was large. The bathroom was wonderful with the double sink. There was only one bathrobe on the hanger in the bathroom. We went sight seeing for several hours and were pleasantly surprised to find another bathrobe in our room. The doormen were fantastic and I hope Roger is there the next time we stay. The location was great and the rooms were quiet. The housekeeping staff was great. Thank you thank you thank you for a wonderful stay.
152,260,"May 10 2006 	Enjoyed the Talbott and would return	This hotel was overall a great stay. I was here for three nights on a business trip. First, the location is excellent. A block from Magnificent Mile on the same block as the Four Seasons, that should give you an idea of the excellent location. Service was outstanding in every way. Staff very friendly and accomodating. Only complaint about the hotel would be the room itself. The bathroom was fantastic (marble, new fixtures, very bright) but the actual bedroom part could use some updating. I felt like the bedspreads had been in use for 15 years. The furniture was dated and the beds felt like they were made in 1985 and made me miss Marriott's Revive bedding. However, I hear they are updating all the rooms and they just had not gotten to mine yet. If this is true (and some construction evidence like blankets on elevator walls would indicate that is is) then the Talbott would be a perfect ten.Overall, recommended."
153,260,"May 3 2006	Excelllent Choice in Prime Neighborhood	We stayed for 5 nights in late April. The hotel lobby is very attractive; the guest rooms well above average. We opted for a 'superior corner room', and were happy, but I peeked in several standard rooms and they would have been just as good. All rooms I saw have 2 comfortable easy chairs. Bathrooms are large, clean and well appointed. The entire staff was pleasant. It was an intimatre experience. After a day the staff knew us. Two excellent concierges (Gene &amp; Stephanie), one too officious (Tim). Great location near the lake, very serene neighborhood, but only 2 blocks from Mich. Ave. It is expensive ($310 per night including tax). As in every hotel in every country the light bulbs are too low in wattage (why??). Have breakfast at Cafe Tempo 1 block north of the hotel. I can't beleive the firstt very negative review. We had no problem with noise or intrusive staff. Construction in a hotel can ruin an experience. Maybe that was it."
154,260,"Apr 4 2006	Talbott is tops	Well located hotel, between State and Michigan Ave in the Maginicent Mile. We had a corner suite. Very clean with a King size bed, a seating area with two armchairs.Plenty of space.Good size bathroom with plenty of towels, lotions, hair dryer and the use of a bath robe. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. About the only complaint would be that the continental buffet runs until 11:00am, at 1 minute to 11:00 it disappears and even though you have arrived prior to 11, forget it."
155,260,"Feb 27 2006	Fraud alert	I called the Talbott for price and avaiability in april 05 for a stay in Chicago in Oct 05. I was asked for my credit card # and assured I would not be charged until I made the actual reservation. I was then charged in Oct for one days stay {$241.00} on my credit card. no reservation was made, and no contact with the hotel to show any transaction had occurred. Now I am still working with my credit card to have this removed. never stayed at hotel, just a bad transaction."
156,260,"Feb 23 2006 	Felt Like Grandma's House	The Talbott feels very warm and glows with history. The dark wood walls and fireplaces in the lobby are such a transition stepping in off the bustling street. It's like you've arrived Grandma's -- cozy, comforting, and OOOOOHHHHH the food. I can't remember the name of the dish, but try the oriental salad with steak. Wow, delicious!! The staff is friendlier than any I've encountered. During my stay, the staff were donning these new communication devices that allowed them to reach anyone in the hotel. They said they were using them to improve their customer service. Well, it worked!! Responsive, friendly, VERY attentive. I'll stay there again and again and again."
157,260,"Jan 18 2006	great place	we had a great, very large 1 bedroom suite, for very reasonable rate. Service was good but they don't valet after certain hours and you have to park your car yourself. Otherwise, folks were very helpful."
158,260,"Jan 13 2006	Terrific Talbott	I recently stayed at the Talbott Hotel (just off Rush and 1.5 blocks from the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;). This is a small boutique hotel in a terrific location within easy walking distance of the John Hancock Center and shopping on Michigan Avenue.From the moment I exited the cab, I was superbly treated by the entire staff, from the doorman to the bartender to the concierge. The property is beautifully appointed, exceedingly clean and well maintained. At half the price of the nearby Four Seasons, this property is a bargain.I have a new favorite hotel in Chicago!"
159,260,"Jan 4 2006	Nice Choice for Chicago	We really liked this hotel. It was very clean and tidy, the room was quite spacious, and the staff was friendly. The location was extremely convenient to shopping and good dining. The free cookies and coffee in the afternoon were excellent. The bed was great, the bathroom was modern and nice. My only complaint was that the concierge seemed a bit overwhelmed all the time, but when you finally could talk to them they were helpful. It's pricey, but a bargain compared to its neighbors and typical big-city prices."
160,260,"Oct 17 2005	Don't choose the Talbot	Great front desk staff, the rest of the experience was dreadful. The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered. We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet, adjacent to our room (almost in the room itself). They do these random room checks for the minibar, as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $9 peanuts. The roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones. If you like sleeping in on your vacation, don't stay here. Also, the hotel was under massive construction, a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website. SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it. No discount because of the work and noise. I'd rather sleep in a box in the alley."
161,260,"Oct 8 2005	Friendly Little Boutique Hotel	I just returned from Chicago with a girlfriend. The Talbott was a very nice place to stay. It is a smaller hotel, but it has the best service. It is the kind of place where everyone knows your name and wants you to have the best experience possible. The conceirge was so helpful getting us into the best restraunts on a last minutes notice, also finding us Oprah tickets! They also printed up my boarding pass, delivered it to my room and did not charge me for their service. They do not nickel and dime you for everything at this hotel. The rooms were very spacious and clean, nice Aveada products in the bathroom and it stayed at a very comfortable temperature. We had 2 queen beds and had plenty of room to move around. It is a short 1.5 blocks from all the shopping and food on Michigan Ave. The American Girl Store was very close by and a must for people with little girls in their lives. The only downsides I can think of is the view from our window was not very great but it was no big deal for us because we only looked outside once. Also there are only 2 elevators so if it was very busy you may have to wait, but we did not have a problem with that. Overall, we were very pleased with our choice to stay there. It was a very intimate hotel and we felt very at home. We cannot wait to go back there for more shopping and fun."
162,260,"Oct 6 2005	Quality Down Rates UP Typical Syndrome	Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time!I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades.Yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently.But other things have gone downhill. For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service.Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging.I, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home."
163,260,Aug 30 2005	A wonderful experiance!	We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay.The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. The tub is large and the shower a pleasure. The location was quiet as requested.The staff was always cheerful and very helpful. Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day.We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay.
164,260,Aug 29 2005 	Cozy and wonderful!	I loved the Talbott! Everything was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable. They have two fireplaces in the cozy lobby and the BEST hot cocoa I have ever had! They don't have a business center but they do have wireless internet. I will be staying at the Talbott again this October.
165,260,"Aug 22 2005	The Talbott is Fabulous	Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott. This was our first visit there, and I can honestly say that I wouldn't stay at any other hotel in Chicago. From when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can I help you attitute. The room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in (including the Four Seasons). Had great breakfasts and drinks at Basil's. You would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the Talbott."
