413,1887,"Feb 3 2004	First trip to USA	We stayed for a week in early January. The room we were allocated was small but was perfectly satisfactory, after all we we were there to see New York not spend time indoors. After two nights we were moved to a larger room for the rest of our stay. We would definitely recommend this hotel. It's in a great area and the staff are efficient and friendly. We hope to return again."
414,1887,"Feb 2 2004	Guaranteed to be a nice stay	The location of the hotel is great if you are in a quaint mood. After staying at the Edison Hotel on Times Square last month, I was ready for a more relaxing visit to the city. After all that is what January is all about, recuperating from the holidays. The hotel is located in a predominantly upscale residential area. The people around are a lot nicer than a tourist filled Times Square pushing you all over the place. There are a few shops located within a few blocks of the hotel such as Pottery Barn, Eddie Bower, Banana Republic, Gap, Kenneth Cole and a Barnes and Noble that stays open late.Around the corner from the hotel is one of my favorite restaurants, Ruby Foo. There is also a nice deli/ restaurant across the street that is open 24 hours. Clean, tasty and reasonably priced.The rooms are of average size. It is done in a very crisp, neat, fresh and clean tone. The beddings are of nice white fabrics and the comforter is in white tone on tone fine linen. The minute you lay on this bed, it feels like you are in a bed of cloud. You dont have to worry about all the unseen dirt hidden in a dark printed comforters used by most hotels. After a day of running around at the chaotic city, it is nice to retire in a serene room.The private bath is done very tastefully. Marble, stainless Steele and updated classic hardware are used. Most importantly, there is no skimping on water pressure and consistency of hot water.Although most of the staffs were friendly, the front desk could be more welcoming when I checked in. It would also help a lot if the hotel has valet parking."
415,1887,"Feb 1 2004	a review	I stayed in this hotel on a trip back to NY from Philadelphia. Only stayed for 2 nights, but was a pleasant stay. Clean and quiet, the rooms weren't too small and sufficient for two--queen room. Heating was fine and it didn't get frigid cold, but outside the window was another building--poor view. Overall, I think that On The Ave offered quaint rooms and equally commendable service. Definite recommendation. As a New Yorker, and having stayed at the New Yorker Hotel before I didn't really have high expectations for On The Ave(The New Yorker rooms were not very pleasing), but it really did make me feel better to see that there were nicer hotels in New York. Good for its price and location. I say, &quot;go for it!&quot;"
416,1887,Feb 1 2004	big little rooms	Stayed at On The Ave on my first trip to New York overnight. The rooms are trendy and very clean. Service is friendly. i would recommend this hotel to anyone I know..
417,1887,"Jan 25 2004	Nice but tiny noisy room	I did a lot of research on the Internet, including TripAdvisor, before I chose this hotel (reserved thru Expedia, cheap prices). We stayed there Jan 4-7. We arrived very early in the morning by bus so we could spend the whole day sightseeing with the New York Passes. The hotel staff was very nice and gave us a room right away so we can put our luggage there and have a small nap. The first thing we noticed about the hotel was that the lobby was nice... The room we got (526 I think - STANDARD ROOM, ontheave.com doesn't show pics of these rooms!) had a view on Broadway St, which is kind of good. Unfortunately, the room was very small. There were no drawers where we could put our clothes in and the TV (which has HBO) is small and sat on a cheap stand. The bathroom was also small and there was a faucet was leaking. Other than that, I enjoyed their big shower. It's true their bed is REALLY confortable! The sheets were clean and thick. Naturally, sleeping is supposed to be easier with that... but the ventilation (heating) was really really LOUD! You get used to it... but then it stops... then starts again... Our room was also about 3m (9ft) from the elevator and we could hear the elevetor bell ring. One other thing that is weird is that even though we put the privacy thing on our door, the cleaning team still knocked on our door to check! During our 4-night stay, I think I only saw the concierge twice. All other times, the desk was empty... Anyway, I'm a little disappointed with the hotel, but I guess I expected too much. The service is very good though and it's a very clean hotel for that price ($109/night)"
418,1887,"Jan 21 2004	What a relief!	While in New York recently on a business trip, I stayed at one of the big expensive downtown hotels, compliments of my company. Once the meetings were over, I stayed in town for a few days on vacation. To save money, I needed to find a more affordable hotel. As I had never been to NYC, I was nervous about finding a decent place in my price range. After reading the reviews at TripAdvisor for the On the Ave Hotel, I decided to stay there. I wasn't disappointed.The rooms were small, of course. This is, after all, NYC. But, the hotel was lovely, and the bed was the most comfortable I've ever found away from home. I loved the big fluffy pillows and soft down comforter. The lobby was ultra chic, and the halls and rooms were clean and well cared for. In comparison, the big expensive hotel had been shabby and quite ugly.The hotel also has a large beautiful balcony that can be accessed by all guests. It's a lovely place to sit and enjoy the view of the skyline and the Hudson River. In general, the location of the hotel is excellent. Two blocks away from the subway station, and right across the street from the Manhattan Diner. This is a fabulous restaurant with very reasonable prices. As the hotel itself has no kitchen, all room service orders are actually delivered from the Diner. That was fine with me, as the meal I had delivered to my room was one of the best I'd ever had in a hotel. The prices were outrageously reasonable, too. An enormous cheeseburger was only $6.95!The On the Ave Hotel is definitely a great value, and I will certainly stay there EVERY time I return to NYC. One bit of caution though...the rooms are not sound-proofed very well so they can be quite noisy if you have boisterous neighbors. The heating units are also pretty load when they kick in, to the point of being startling until you get used to them. To be fair, I've never really found a very quiet hotel in my travels, so I don't think this is much of a deterent for On the Ave. Cheers, and happy traveling!"
419,1887,"Jan 13 2004	My new favorite spot!	I wanted a hotel close to a friends house and I chose this one from the reviews here and it's location. I was extremely pleased with my choice. The staff was pleasant and my room smelled amazing. The room is modern, clean, well lit...perfect for one person or a close couple. The rate was very affordable.Things to know, though: if this is your first trip to the city and you are looking for a hotel near Midtown, you might not want this one. It is a short cab ride, but not really within walking distance.The room service is terrible. The girl at the counter assured me that the food is usually good, though. My omelet was dry and the toast was rubber. I would have liked for the hotel to pick up that tab, but they did not offer.Otherwise, a perfect stay and a great find."
420,1887,"Jan 8 2004	Great Value!	I had to take care of some personal business in New York and originally had booked the West Side Inn, but after reading the reviews in the TA, I decided to opt for On the Ave Hotel through Expedia. At first I was a bit leary but after reading the reviews I took a chance. Great location and the rooms were nice and clean. Being in the military I have stayed in some places which were worse. On the Ave Hotel puts you in the real New York of neighborhoods and people. The modern-like furnishings reminded me of a Kenneth Cole-like store but I ws not in the room much except to shower and sleep. Its not plush, but if you want a clean room and a great location, I would highly recommend it!"
421,1887,"Jan 6 2004	Charming for the Price	Stayed from January 2-4th at $109 per night pre-paid through expedia. Attractive lobby. Room was decent sized for NYC. The overall appeareance of the room was modern/minimalist, light, and tasteful (the photos on expedia are the luxury rooms not the standard ones so modify your expectations). The walls, trim, and furniture were a bit worn when viewed in daylight but not dirty or depressing. The bathroom was not large but attractive - the steel vanity and shelves provided lots of space. The hotel and room had nice touches like bathrobes, top floor terrace with great view, mood lighting, complimentary coffee in lobby. Location was wonderful with affordable restaurants and dessert places steps away. Staff appeared efficient and professional. The only thing we did not like was the connecting door to the next hotel room - we would hear our neighbors conversations too well. However it was manageable and we would have talked to staff had it been more of a problem."
422,1887,"Jan 5 2004	Fantastic	We stayed at On The Ave for one week in July 2003. The hotel was great! The average rooms were on the small side, but they were very comfortable for two people. The decor throughout the hotel is very modern. The staff was more than friendly. They helped us with everything. We checked in very early in the morning, so we assumed our room wouldn't be ready until the afternoon. But the front desk staff said that if we go out for breakfast and come back, our room would be ready. And it was! And the price was excellent. The location couldn't be better-- in the heart of the Upper West Side near some fantastic restaurants and cafes... and it's not too touristy. It's close to the subway and a $6.00 cab ride will get you to Times Square if you can't handle the 20 minute walk. Highly recommended!!!!"
423,1887,"Dec 29 2003	Location price style	We stayed at the hotel over Christmas, 2003. This hotel is obviously a less-expensive version of the popular &quot;boutique&quot; hotels. Rooms are pleasant and appointed with contemporary style. The only two complaints were that there is no heavy drapery to darken the room--just a sheer for privacy and that the heat/air-conditioning fan sounds like a freight train coming through. But for the money and the location, it would be tough to beat. Other hotels in this price range tend to look frumpy and tired. The Upper West Side is ideal in many ways: safe, near Central Park and Riverside Drive; a five-minute walk to Lincoln Center; easy to find restaurants are nearby. The Manhattan Diner, across the street, is open 24 hours and has great breakfasts. Zabar's and H&amp;H Bagels are within a 5 minute walk, as it the Beacon Theater. Our room--lowest price--was small, but not closet-sized as some Manhattan rooms are. I'd highly recommend this hotel."
424,1887,"Dec 21 2003	excellent place to stay	Wow, what can i say? We arrived at 2am and ended getting an upgrade -to a suite- as all the rooms were taken. We stayed from 10th-12th Dec 2003 and had a lovely time. Rooms were a good size (due to upgrade, but even if we did not get the upgrade, we would have been more than happy.The only reservations we had was the noise level, both from within the hotel and from traffic outside, but we could overlook that small detail.Oh, you must go and speak to the concierge &quot;Flo&quot; for what to do and where to go; she was sooooooo friendly and helpful i would happily go back just for that. Should you read this Flo, we thought you were the best."
425,1887,"Nov 12 2003	wonderful little place	My partner and I flew out on a whim to see Regina Carter play Paganini's violin . . so we were already in a good mood. The room looked small (and is small) upon first entering, but since our stay was only 3 nights and the weather was wonderful, it really didn't matter. The room is appointed in a neat way and we had only one complaint: MAN! When that air conditioner came on it was LOUD. And I mean REALLY loud. It sorta woke us up! The staff was helpful and that was enough. The location was great w/ a subway station a block away. We are returning to see THE PRODUCERS in February and we'll stay there again. (The bed is the BEST!)(FYI, Room 806) Happy, in Texas. Oh, PS: The shower had great pressure!!!!"
426,1887,"Oct 23 2003	Fab Hotel / Great Location	Just arrived home after our first stay in New York, and after accidently finding this website, thought i would add my own review to help others looking for info. Arrived nervously at the hotel expecting the worst - because hotel pictures and descriptions can be sooooo misleading, waiting for my husbands disapproval and the &quot; i told u we should have booked through the travel agent, &quot; comment. We had splashed out on a standard penthouse, but when checking in were instantly upgraded, giving us a room with 2 balconies with views over Central Park one way, and the Hudson River the other way, FANTASTIC !!!!!!!! Lounge area with sofa, chair, TV, coffee facilities ( when using the coffee machine DON'T open the bag of coffee, place directly into machine, does make a huge mess otherwise - Ooooops. ) Bedroom area with bathroom and a great shower. Staff wise, the doormen, porters and house keeping staff were really friendly and welcoming. Great location being just out of the hustle &amp; bustle but with good transport links within 5 mins walk. Central Parks fab - loads of squirrels to watch and joggers to make you feel really unfit !!!!!!! If you've not been to New York before like us, i would recommend contacting the Big Apple Greeters, you choose your itinerary and a local New Yorker shows you round for FREE. My last recommendation would be Spazzia Restaurant, 5 minutes walk from the hotel on 366 Columbus Avenue, GREAT food and reasonably priced. Would stay here again."
427,1887,"Sep 23 2003	Great Location	On the Ave is a great hotel located a bit out of the heart of Manahattan, but only 2.5 miles from Times Square which is a quick subway ride. The subway station is 2 short blocks from the Hotel. The standard rooms are small, but when your in NY your there to see the sights and the night life, so unless your planning on spending a lot of time in your room it's a great choice. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending places to eat and see around the hotel."
428,1887,"Sep 16 2003	Great choice.	We stayed at On the Ave for 3 nights in September 2003. It's a great choice. The hotel is in a nice, safe neighborhood with many great restaurants, shops and theaters (Beacon) nearby. Our room didn't have a view - but it was very comfortable and quiet and had all the amenities we needed. The rooms are very modern and very tastefully designed. It definitely feels like you're staying in a much pricier place. Our room was heavenly to come back to after hectic sightseeing. The beds are very comfortable and the standard queen rooms have ample space for 2 people. The entire staff was very gracious and helpful. On checkout we asked to see a penthouse suite for future visits. It was beautiful and had excellent views of the city and of the water. On the Ave is out of the hustle and bustle of midtown, which is a good thing. Times Square, although fun to pass through, is too crowded with tourists. The Upper west side is off the beaten path. It is full of families and young professionals and has a very homey feel to it. It's a 10-minute walk to the 77th street entrance to Central Park and about a 20 - 25 minute walk across the Park to the Guggenheim museum. Also you can walk 2 minutes up or down Broadway to the subway stations at either 72nd or 79th Street and catch either the 1 or the 9 which stop at all major destinations such as Columbus Circle, Times Square, Penn Station, NYU, SoHo, and the south ferry station for the Staten Island Ferry. In the neighborhood be sure to check out H&amp;H bagels for breakfast and Citrus (Asian + Southwestern fusion) or Mugahli (Indian) for dinner."
429,1887,"Sep 4 2003	A Fairly Decent Hotel	September 2003 I have just returned from a 8 day trip in New York, staying at On The Ave for 6 days. As their were 3 of us (1 adult, 2 children) requesting a stay bed the front desk staff recommended a larger room at the back of the hotel. I liked the room, but larger she said, I wondered how much smaller it could get (but never having stayed in NYC before I have nothing to compare it against) and also dark, but this may have been well in part to all the windows facing a brickwall - and I was warned by reception! The room was tastefully decorated, and the bathroom was lovely - I do like modern furniture. The beds were unbelievably comfortable. I could have slept forever. More than anything I loved the area, the Upper West Side is such a natural, calm part of Manhattan I couldn't image wanting to stay anywhere else. Central Park a few blocks away, both trains and buses within easy reach and great grocery and clothes shops within walking distance (we kind of toured a bit). I loved eating at Viand a few blocks down, each morning. The Ice/snack room was dingy and oddly placed I must admit. I meet some interesting guests it appears that there are some longterm single stayers around - I did not appreciate that much. Reception is clean and quite elegant, with a pianist in the evenings which I personally just found very loud. Use internet access in small shop across the road, it is way cheaper than the one offered in the hotel and have a look from the 16th floor public access roof balcony that is great. I cannot fault service, a lovely clean room each night and the NY Times each morning. Although I cannot really complain I found the whole place somewhat impersonal, I have stayed at grubbier places that were more homely and overall friendly, but I will give it another go more so because I really liked the area. Next time though I will definately go for a room at the front of the hotel with a view."
430,1887,"Aug 31 2003	Great Neighborhood	First time in New York City and read the reviews and loved the price we got for a king room. It was definetly on the small side but was very clean. The bath was excellent with its shiny stainless steel and a great shower. The staff was very accommodating and answered some probably 'dumb' questions about the use of the subway, etc. I needed to print out a boarding pass from a web site and they offered their office computer to me to do that. The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood with lots of eating places, an excellent market across the street and two blocks from the subway and Central Park. Also nearby is the Museum of History and Planitarium and Tavern on the Green is about a 5-10 minute walk. Also a theatre 2 blocks away. All in all a very nice stay and will definetly return since my wife and I fell in love with New York City! What a unique city with so much to see and do. Fabulous!"
431,1887,"Aug 28 2003	wonderful Location	My husband and I stayed at On the Ave for 5 days in mid August. The room was small, but actually bigger than we expected after the other reviews. The room was clean and stylish and the bathroom and shower were very nice..housekeeping service was also excellent. The staff was polite and helpful at all times. The location was wonderful, in a somewhat residential neighborhood, and the diner across the street served excellent breakfast. There were also several other delis and supermarkets in the area. It was also nice to be within a couple of blocks of central park. I also noticed that several other reviewers complained about the noise, but our room was near the elevator and we never heard a sound. I would certainly recommend staying at this hotel and will stay here on my next trip to New York."
432,1887,"Aug 25 2003	Great Value Hotel	A friend and I stayed at the On the Ave Hotel for a week at the beginning of August 2003. The hotel exceeded all our expectations for a modestly priced hotel in NYC. The room was fairly small, but not claustrophobic, and it was beautifully maintained. The minimalist design and gorgeous bathroom really made for a relaxing stay. Everything worked well, and the extra touches such as a CD player, iron and ironing board, etc. were very nice. Housekeeping service was excellent, and they even delivered the New York Times to our door every weekday morning. The location is fabulour - in a great neighbourhood, walking distance from Central Park, and convenient to subway and bus stops. We would definitely stay there again, and found it to be a very good value for New York."
433,1887,Aug 23 2003	Nice hotel well located small rooms	I spent a weekend at the hotel. The rooms are small but nicely decorated and clean. Much better than other small hotels in the city. Very well located in the upper west side. I would come back to this hotel.
434,1887,"Aug 19 2003	My worst hotel experience	My stay was the worst hotel experience I have ever had! The first night was o.k. but the second night was a disaster, literally! At 1:30AM there was a commotion in the hall and an unusual smell, the smell of smoke. I quickly got dressed, opened my door and was hit with a cloud of smoke. Fortunately I was on the 5th floor. There were no alarms, no calls, no directions over the intercom, no communications. Speaking with the fire chief in the lobby I was told that the people on duty were not adequately trained to use the control system so no communications. The fire chief also said that the hotel was going to get a criminal citation for this event. Adding insult to the situation, when I departed I was told that the hotel would make some type of restitution. I sent one letter and one email requesting that the hotel cover the cost of cleaning my smoke penetrated clothing and to refund the room for the night of the fire. They were completely unresponsive, ignoring both of my requests. There are many other moderately priced hotels in the area and would suggest this hotel be avoided at all cost!"
435,1887,"Aug 16 2003	Sound proofing matters to me.	I stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights. (Penthouse suite with balcony!!!) I wasn't able to sleep because I heard every possible noise from all directions. The room was pretty nice compared to the hotels with same price range. My room also had a fabulous view. The balcony was real nice, too.The frontdesk staff wasn't really kind nor professinaly trained. I had a pet with me and one of them had no idea if the hotel was charging money for the pet or not. and they told me they would let us know the later day and I didn't not get any answer!!!!"
436,1887,"Aug 3 2003	Great place for short stay in NYC	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night in late June 2003. It is the best hotel experience we've had in our three trips to NYC. The room was small, but very clean and the updated contemporary European furniture and bathroom fixtures gave it a nice feel. The lobby was grand and the hotel workers were very polite and helpful. This is a great place to stay if you will be in town only for a night or two. It's in a quiet (for NYC) upscale neighborhood and only two blocks from the American Museum of Natural History and the 77th street entrance Central Park and Strawberry Fields. I wouldn't recommend this hotel on the Upper East Side if you want to spend much time sightseeing across the city because you will spend a good deal of time on the subway or incur some pricey cab fares."
437,1887,"Jul 30 2003	Fantastic hotel and fantastic value	We stayed for 7 nights at On The Ave Hotel in Manhattan in July 2003. We found the hotel to be wonderful. It seemed recently renovated, with a very cool lobby and very cool room. The room sizes do appear to vary, though - we initially had a smallish double room, but then changed to a much larger (50% more space) double room (reason for change was that the toilet in the other room had issues). The rooms are very nice, and the beds are unbeatable - so comfortable! The room lighting is very soft and quite dark - perhaps there could be the option of brighter lighting (just easier to read things, etc). The reception staff were at times fairly impersonal, but the doormen were always helpful and friendly. Location on the Upper West Side is great - 77th and Broadway. Short walk down Broadway to the 72nd street subway station (express trains downtown) or to the local 79th Street station. Don't use in-room internet, use the internet at the copy place across the street from the hotel (much cheaper). Easy access to local shopping, drinking and dining on Broadway, Amsterdam and Columbus. Will always stay here on future visits to NYC. Excellent!"
438,1887,"Jul 14 2003	Prison Cells Have More Room	Was this place a converted half-way house??They've tried to squeeze so many rooms into this joint, there are prison cells with more living-room. The first room they assigned us this past weekend had but two tiny frosted/dirty windows on the sides of an interior wall to which the bed faced. They even tried to cover this WALL up with a curtain as if no one would notice there are no windows or daylight. After informing the desk that this room was unacceptable they gave us another room which was a bit smaller and nicer, but right next to elevator and above Broadway (5th floor). Horrible sound proofing resulted in hearing every ding of the elevator and sounds from hallway and street.I believe the discount booking service we used did a disservice to me and will do such to its guests by not informing them that at least for this place the rooms being given are without question the bottom of the barrel.Plus the front desk moves at a snails pace. Oh! and to the vending/ice room - that's an interesting trip."
439,1887,"Jul 8 2003	Great Hotel - Nice Service - Small but Attractive Rooms	Stayed here for a week and we loved it. Space is limited, but that is expected in NY. Bathrooms were clean and very stylish. Sharp look to entire hotel. Only issue was with the vending machine room. It is located in a scary, little, hidden away corner on the top floor. Bring your own drinks."
440,1887,Jul 8 2003	Night of Fireworks	My Fiance and I rode our motorcycles to New York to see the fireworks on the east river. We had a very good stay at the hotel and were treated very nice by all of the staff. They were very helpful in directing us to a nice deli and helping with questions about the subway and parking and such. The hotel was very clean and very well ran..........
441,1887,"Jun 7 2003	Nice place small rooms	Nice, modern, hip kind of place. Room was comfortable but extremely tiny -- Luckily I was alone as it would have been too small for two people. Hotel has a great central location on the Upper West Side. I would stay there again but request a room with a king bed (as these have got to be bigger than the double I stayed in!). Staff was helpful and friendly."
442,1887,May 21 2003	Fantastic!	A wonderful Hotel. Prices are reasonable enough that we were able to afford the Penthouse Suite. We had most the roof to ourselves and it was the best time I've ever had in New York. I cannot wait to go back!
443,1887,"May 16 2003	Small but nice	This was an extremely nice hotel. The staff was very nice however the room was alot smaller than I had anticipated. If you have the means, then try to stay in one of the suites. You practically have to stand on the toilet to close the bathroom door in the standard room...but the shower was very roomy. The hotel was in a very safe neighborhood, but slightly far from the &quot;main attractions.&quot;"
444,1887,"May 9 2003	Pleasant and Good Value	My boyfriend and I stayed at On The Ave for 10 nights in March. It was our first time in NY and I spent a considerable amount of time researching a hotel that would be enjoyable to stay in and fit our tight budget.Taking the advice of several reviews here and others on the internet we selected On The Ave. We were very happy with our choice. The room was good, not luxurious, but clean and comfortable and, I believe, quite large for NY. The bathroom was lovely, clean and modern with a large shower.We did not have much contact with the staff but what we did was efficent and helpful.The views from the roof are fabulous and worth checking out, and the suites look excellent if you can afford a bit more.The location was perfect for our tourist style trip, with the Subway just 2 minutes away and Central Park less than 5 minutes walk. A plesant residental area with families, coffee shops and excellent supermarkets.The quality of a hotel can really change your experience of your holiday in my opinion and I would recommend On The Ave as good value and much nicer than a larger chain unless you can afford something glitzier!"
445,1887,May 2 2003	cheap chic	Selected this hotel after reading favorable reviews on tripadvisor. I found the hotel to be less than I expected for the price. They try to do chic on the cheap. Rooms lack ammenities that one would expect at this price range. The hotel is nothing more than basic accomodation. You can spend a couple of dollars more and get a much better location and room. Would not stay here again.
446,1887,Mar 21 2003	Experience modern design here	We stayed here over a weekend. We had booked into The Beacon for a few nights and had wanted to leave ourselves free to move around.It is very stylish but we felt that didn't make it homely. The modern design made everything &quot;hard edged&quot;. This was particularly true in the bathroom where the metal sink felt like you were washing in the kitchen.No coffee making facilities in the room either.Clean with friendly staff. Just not our taste in decor.
447,1887,"Mar 10 2003	Excellent 	Spent 11 nights at on the ave. Staff were pleasant and very helpful. I checked in late and changed rooms and the staff could not have been more helpful. The room was a large room (even though it was &quot;L&quot; shaped) with everything promised and illustrated on the net. Transport links are very good with the Metro (Tube) 2 blocks away. Also Almo, National and Avis car rentals are very close (e.g across the street).There's room service available or there the Manhattan or Nicks Dinner (24hrs) opposite the hotel. There is also a Stand Up comedy club 1 block away (on 78th I think)"
448,1887,"Feb 19 2003	Size Does Matter! From ex-New Yorker	Did alot of research on the net for a reasonably priced yet stylish hotel that allowed small pets. I lucked out with On the Avenue Hotel. The standard rooms are small but were in my price range. When I checked in, I inquired about touring the larger rooms just out of curiousity, and mentioned that I was celebrating an Anniversary. The wonderful hotel desk clerk went to talk to her manager, and returned to tell me that I had been upgraded to a suite - compliments of the hotel! I could not be happier. The room was large with a huge balcony and windows. Everything depicted on their website was well translated in this particular suite. I ended up staying 4 nights and wished I could have stayed longer. The hotel is near all transportation, and shopping. Restaurants are right outside on the avenue. Central Park is just two blocks away for a morning stroll or jog. This is the only hotel I would consider for my future visits to NY!"

1,1889,"Very Rude Staff Misleading Photos Good Location	Other than location this hotels offers very little. We will not stay there again. The front desk staff was consistently rude and unhelpful with the exceptions far and few between. The concierge, maintenance and cleaners are more friendly and helpful. The best way to describe the room is a patched up. Do not let the photos on the website deceive you. The walkways and room smell of old carpets. Our room was next to a vending machine that made such a noise it had to be switched off when we complained. The towels in the bathroom were so old two of them tore while using them. Hot water is a problem between 07:00 and 08:30 in the morning. We ended up not showering during these times. We also often had to flush the toilet more than once.But my overriding memory of this hotel is the rude front desk staff. At times it threatened to completely ruin our stay."
2,1889,Fantastic Hotel!! Even better staff and management!!!	I stayed here for 6 nights recently on my honeymoon and this hotel is perfect!!!! We were upgraded to an amazing suite on the 21st floor. We could see Times Square from our bedroom window!!The hotel is in the most perfect location to access all New York has to offer.. The staff were always extremely helpful and the concierge helped us with any questions we had on day trips etc.. We had a small problem with the heating and within two minutes the maintenance guy was up and had it all fixed... The lobby is really welcoming and the food was gorgeous... This hotel is perfect and brilliant value for anyone travelling to New York and the staff really make you feel so welcome..I would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family! Dont be ripped off by overpriced hotels and keep your money for your holiday! Stay in the Park Central!!!!Great Hotel!!!
3,1889,"Nov 23 2009 	Very Good	Found the staff100% helpful with our situations of early check in, storage , cleaning and help with the in rooom safe. Super service. Very pleasant. Room was clean, beds comfortable, clean, nice linen, and very nice room. Very busy hotel but quiet and very well organized staff. Lots of staff to ask questions of. Elavator was great with the touch screen. I missed in room coffee but lots of shops nearby, can think of 3 offhand that sold coffee and econnomical meals and snacks. And the Carnegie Deli almost next door. Great for people new to this city . Very happy with my choice of this hotel."
4,1889,"Nov 23 2009 	Old building just covered up existing problems.	This hotel is right near everything that anyone new to New York may want to do. The hotel is kinda cool. Old looking on the outside and the lobby and bar have been updated nicely and there is a nice atmosphere there. The rooms were not as cool. When I first walked into my room it smelled like the people who had probably just checked out...bad. To remedy, I asked the nice housekeeper for some spray and she quickly went in and took care of the problem for me. She even adjusted the heat because she thought maybe the old heating system was circulating stagnant, old air. The bathroom was roomy but you could see water stains at the top of the shower and the vent in there was dirty. After I went to sleep I swear the room smelled a little like pee but I was done complaining for the night and new it really was just the air and maybe the carpet a bit. It looked ok but you can see that wallpaper had gone over shabby walls. The staff was really nice. They don't check people in until four so it was a nice surprise when they tried to accommodate me and they let me check in at noon. I was happy about that and they also gave me an apple. :)If you use this hotel just maybe inspect your room before finally settling down. They need some work but I wasn't that upset with it."
5,1889,"Nov 22 2009 	Lucky I didn't listen to negative reviews!	I almost cancelled my reservation for the Park Central prior to my departure after reading the many negative reviews here but given the great price for 5 nights at just US$1,300 including taxes , I took the risk. After working for a week in LA, I went to New York for a bit of a break before heading back to Melbourne. It has been 13 years since my last visit there.After reading the many negative reviews, I prepared for the worst. I entered this large hotel and found the reception area nice, clean and spacious and the reception staff were very courteous and welcoming. Could this be the same hotel I was reading about on Tripadvisor? They gave me my room key for the 17th floor and I was very nervous as I entered the key to open the door. I thought, how bad can the room be? To my shocked surprise, the room was bigger than what I thought. The king size bed was massive, the widescreen TV was great and the room smelt nice. One last check was the bathroom and, lo and behold, not once trace of fungus or odour and, for New York and for a single, it was big enough.I will definitely be staying at this hotel again but I will be sure to get the same room as I heard other rooms on the lower levels may not be as nice. Given the rate, this hotel was a steal and the location was perfect. It was great to leave the hotel at 7.30pm and walk just five minutes to a Broadway play starring Bill Pullman and Julia Stiles starting at 8pm. Heaven! Only in New York!"
6,1889,"Nov 22 2009	Disappointed with Responsiveness of Staff	I actually did not stay in this hotel so I can't review. My daughter stayed in this hotel with a group from her school. She left a pair of UGG boots in her room. We immediately called the hotel upon her return. In the course of a week, I talked to 3 different people (Lost and Found, Front Desk personnel, etc) who never returned my calls after telling me they would check into the lost boots. The boots have not been found and we all know those boots didn't walk out of that hotel alone. It is a shame that I was not transferred to Hotel Security when I first called because perhaps they could have reached the person responsible for cleaning that room sooner. Four different occasions I called this hotel over the course of a week and no one ever returned the call. It is a shame there aren't measures in place to ensure that items left behind aren't returned to their owner. A pair of boots can't be slipped in to anyone's pocket and they didn't go down with the laundry. Additionally, they could not have been taken by the next guest in this room as they were left by the closet door where someone would have vacuumed. I have asked for reimbursement for my boots. A check for the purchase price of the boots is all I want and I don't think unreasonable to ask at all. The hotel should have security measures in place that eliminate the chance staff can walk out with guest items. Perhaps a sweet of the rooms by a Lost and Found supervisor after people check out."
7,1889,"Nov 19 2009 	Great location miserable staff	Just spent 4 nights in this hotel , a group of 14 friends. Hotel is in a great location and rooms are cleaned to good standard. The housekeeping staff are very helpful and friendly but the reception staff are miserable and rude ( with the exception of Fred). They completely mixed up the booking and blamed everyone else but themselves for their incompetence. Everyone was charged a different rate if they experienced breakfast dining and they made no excuses for the different charges. We booked 2 triple rooms and 4 doubles and they took an extra $160 dollars from my sisters account for a third bed which had already been paid for without letting her know . She discovered they had taken the payment from her account when she got back home and she now has to try and get the money back. The conciege staff are no better. They might know a lot about New York but they know very little about good customer service! Having said all that, we still had a great time. You just have to be very careful to check your bill before you leave!"
8,1889,"Nov 18 2009 	rude people	just back from NYC stayed in Park Central hotel great location in the middle of everything, hotel nice on arrival but people @ reception very rude not a bit helpfull they never smiled we were put into a room that hadnt been cleaned properly wallpaper peeling from walls, mildew growing out of the celing over the bath overall not clean , went to complain then was moved to another room great view but room still wasnt up to scratch think they need a word with the cleaners"
9,1889,"Nov 17 2009 	Nice hotel on a great location.	We stayed in this hotel 5 nights during our first visit to this great city. We were very satisfied with the hotel. The room was big enough, the bed was very comfortable and we also liked it that it was possible to open the window. We did not use much of the hotel services and didn't eat at the restaurant so I can't say much about that. The people who we spoke were very friendly and helpfull. The best thing was the location and value, Between Central Park and Times Square on 7th avenue.I have read some of the negative comments which made me a little worried, I fully agree with the positive comments."
10,1889,"Nov 16 2009 	Awesome Hotel! Very friendly staff!	Enjoyed this hotel very much! ALL the staff that we dealt with were very helpful &amp; friendly. Karen at the Concierge desk is AWESOME!! She knows all about New York and has great recommendations! The Lobby is very nice and trendy. The rooms are comfortable. The guy out front that hails cabs for you (forgot his name!) is also great!A few recommendations - the bathrooms NEED vents - they get very hot and steamy after a shower! Also, the hostess at the restaurant should tell you that it is not included in your room, and that it is VERY pricey. The food is ok, but definitely not worth $30/person. I did not feel we got our moneys worth at the restaurant.Other then that - the place was great. A lot of reviews on here complain about the elevators, but I thought the system worked great!The location is perfect - about a 2 minute walk to Central Park and 10 minutes to Times Square. &quot;The Irish Pub&quot; across the street usually has a good crowd and is lot's of fun!"
11,1889,"Nov 16 2009 	Average hotel in good but noice location	We stayed one night in Park Central Hotel. Room was acceptable (150$/n), but some renovation would be nice to have (outdated rooms). Location was great but due the high traffic some noise can disrupt your sleep."
12,1889,"Nov 15 2009 	I Recommend it !	Even though the hotel is old, the rooms are ok, they are small just like all the hotels in Manhattan. Bathroom works very well, celaness is good, they offer HD TV. The most important attribute I think is the location, you are just a 10 min walk from Central Park, 5th Av or times square. Its at the final stop of one of the metro yellow lines. Besides there are several options of restaurants around, for breakfast and/or dinner."
13,1889,"Nov 15 2009 	Fabulous location - average room...but who stays in the room all day??	I stayed at Park Central for two days, for a business-related trip, but I did have some free time to explore the city. The hotel is wonderfully located, as other reviews have noted - easy walk to Times Square, 7th Ave/57th St shopping, and Central Park. Access to subway lines is equally close by.The room itself was small (but average size for Manhattan hotels), and in fairly run-down condition (peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, an aircondition/heat unit with a VERY dirty filter, a saggy mattress). But it was clean and reasonably comfortable, and besides...I was only there to sleep, then I was back out in the city.The concierge and front desk staff were all extremely helpful, friendly, and happy to answer questions. I appreciated their efforts and their service."
14,1889,"Nov 14 2009 	Ideal location clean and friendly.	I have just returned from this hotel. I was very pleased with my stay there. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff were very friendly, especially the concierge. Times Square was a 10 minute walk down 7th avenue, the shops on 5th were 10 minutes walk along 54th street. The metro is on the next block.The cost of staying at the hotel is middle of the road, and I think its good value."
15,1889,"Nov 13 2009 	start spreadin' the news	We stayed in room 851 from Oct. 29 to Nov. 4, '09. No major problems. We were in town for the marathon. A few small items. We &quot;get it&quot; about the lobby remodel being &quot;cutting edge&quot; and &quot;with it&quot;, but get rid of the crappy music. This happens a lot: millions put into a remodel and no thought at all into the music. Turn it down and how about some jazz, big band, or oldies?. Next, we had to call three times for a coffee pot and they didn't charge us, like they should have. Bathroom mold: just give each housekeeper a bottle of Tylex to spray on the moldy caulking. Reall simple, and it would make a difference. The free apples at the desk were a nice touch. We liked the hotel, the elevators, the location, the price. We would stay again, gladly."
16,1889,"Nov 13 2009 	Nice hotel	Very modern posh hotel. Drinks and food quite expensive, but a very nice place to stay. Staff were very helpful and the rooms were very nice. Towels were changed every day and housekeeping staff were very good. The reception area and bar was very nice indeed. Can't really fault the place. No kettle in the room but Starbucks is next door."
17,1889,Nov 10 2009 	Brilliant location	Couldn't really fault the hotel. Our room was spotless and the location fantastic. We would definitely stay there again.
18,1889,"Nov 9 2009 	Excellent location particular staff were helpful lousy follow up	The hotel is in an excellent location, the presentation is impeccable, the room was clean and comfortable however the hotel service was not on par with the expectations. There were particularly helpful staff who helped me with using the phone - the phone system in US is not particularly user friendly and very expensive. I also had the experience of being quoted without various taxes which boosted the bill unexpectedly but the worst has been being charged twice for accommodation. The charge appears as two separate transactions on my credit card. I called the hotel several times on my return home and had to keep calling till I finally got put through to a person, rather than voicemail and the matter is still unresolved. I would recommend the hotel for its location, but with the caveat of buyer beware! I would be happy to update my rating if the matter is resolved."
19,1889,"Nov 9 2009 	Very good location average hotel	I stayed at the park Central for 2 nights at the end of October and was quite disappointed with the hotel.Location is really great, so if this is what you are looking for, and you don't stay too many nights definitely go for it.It also was a good bargaign for us, since we found a 60% discount on booking.com. If you find an offer like this, considering the location, the hotel is definitely worth it. But I would never stay at Park Central for full rate.The hotel is quite old style, particularly room and bathroom. Nice and design lobby and bar. They have 3 small elevators (you see 5 people max) for 35 floors, and one was broken for the whole stay. Nothing special in the room (no fridge, nothing to boil water and make a tea, ...) nor amenities in the hotel. Wifi connection is very expensive.Check out is supposed to be at 12:00 but the morning we left the hotel, the cleaning man came to knock at our door THREE TIMES to know what time we planned to leave. The first time, since it was 8 in the morning and we where still sleeping, he even came into the room.One good point: there is a booking desk for broadway tickets/tour/restaurants and the woman is very nice and helpful."
20,1889,"Nov 8 2009 	Location is everything.	For somewhere to rest one's head in midtown without breaking the bank, the Park Central offers reasonable comfort and a location which is ideal. Everything is either within walking distance or accessible via 'bus or subway. Plenty of excellent etaing of every sort within a few blocks. Breakfast at Europa (two blocks up) is very civilised.Had pre-booked on line and there were no problems checking in. Room (11th floor) was fine) with adequate amenities and a clean bathroom. The only disadvantage of the room was a lack of natural light in daytime as it looked into the deep central well with only a blank facing wall to look at. The upside of this was that there was little traffic noise.One or two minor niggles (but not enough to spoil anything):* lack of tea / coffee making facilties in room* not enough lifts at certain times (four for the entire south end)* when I asked about movie listings at Concierge I was very curtly informed by a disinterested young man that they were not provided and I would have to use business centre to log on.* lack of free internet access on lobby or other area (quite standard in many European hotels)* Having to pay to leave luggage for day following checkout - this really should be part of the service. I have never been charged for this before. And in a similar vein was unable to use nearby rest room on collecting luggage as it required room card access.I mention these not to put anybody off staying but to pass on to the management which clearly does read these reviews. Overall the facilities were pretty good for the hotel's grading and position. With a few tweaks it could be an excellent hotel."
21,1889,"Nov 4 2009 	Don't stay in this hotel.	When I got to the hotel I really liked it. The lobby was very nice and the check in was very quick and easy. My room was dirty, there was dust all over the carpet, the airconditioning did not work and the bathroom had hair in the tub and there was mold all over the ceiling. I wrote to the hotel and never received a response. If the board of health would have seen the bathroon ceiling they would have closed down the hotel."
22,1889,"Nov 2 2009 	Exceptionally bad service	Stayed here for a week.Upon arrival, handed cash for accomodation. We were then informed that 14.75% city taxes were not included which cost approximately 200dollars extra. This had not been on our documentation.Room was clean and basic. Location excellent. 5-10mins walk from times square and also near central park.On third day, received a call from hotel demanding 100dollars extra as a deposit. However, my 50dollars was taken from my credit card, and my friend did not receive her 50dollars back either. We left the room in very good condition, and did not use the mini bar etc for the duration of our stay. One staff member told us we were entitled to it all back, but upon collection the promise had been unfulfilled.When en route to JFK, i realised i'd forgotten my phone. I decided i'd call the hotel as soon as i got home (as i didn't have their number.)I had to call the hotel ELEVEN times. The communication skills of the staff were implorable. I was told on 4occasions that i'd be called back (which never happened), told on another occasion that the hotel wouldn't call back an international number. On another occasion i was hung up on-as soon as i called back another staff member gave out to me for hanging up on her colleague. I was livid. I have been on to the hotel for the past 3DAYS to get a simple answer . Over 72hours later, i was finally told my phone was not found-i wouldn't trust the staff at this hotel, as i'm 100% i left it there. I realise it was my own fault for leaving it there, but the false promises, lack of communication and disrespect was too much for me.I believe you can get better value for money in another hotel with just as good a location. False promises, new bills being added on, and a complete and utter incapable management would completely deter me from recommending this hotel to anyone.These people aren't capable of giving a simple answer, never mind running a hotel."
23,1889,"Nov 2 2009 	Lovely hotel has all you need	Located in a busy-enough part of Manhattan (corner of 55th Street and 7th Avenue). Ten minute walk from Times Square, Broadway shows, Madame Tussaude's, 5th Avenue, Central Park. Has a Subway stop right outside the door ($2 per single trip, very good value compared to taxis. Great place to stay if you're interested in sight-seeing. Would need to get the subway to any downtown areas but this wouldn't take more than 25 mins.Good size rooms for New York, we stayed in a King room and had plenty space for 2 large suitcases. Flat-screen tv, en-suite, room service, air conditioning, comfortable bed, clean.SOME THING TO WATCH FOR: Breakfast not included and is dear. Buy it somewhere else. Rooms are a bit dark, need to have lamps on most of the time. You can sometimes hear people in the corridor outside but it isn't too loud. Elevators are slow going to the lobby but very fast going up to the rooms."
24,1889,"Nov 1 2009 	Great location great service and great rooms	Park central hotel was one of the best experience i've ever had. The hotel is located in a great location with great views from Time Square. The rooms were clean and every single detail was there. Price very affordable. Customer service was great from the entrance to the people bringing your luggage up to your room. Especial consideration to the front office manager George Jacob. He was very kind, very helpful and very pleasant all time to us.I'm definitely coming back and i refer this hotel to anyone who wants to have an unique experience in the heart of NYC."
25,1889,"Nov 1 2009 	A great hotel	I stayed here for 5 nights with my sister and thought it was great. I was apprehensive after reading some of the reviews, but on my arrival I was happy. The shower curtain rail was loose; I informed reception, within an hour it was fixed. I asked for fresh towels every day as there was no where to dry our towels; the fresh towels were delivered. It would have been nice for tea/coffee facilities, but I've stayed in many hotels that don't have them, plus starbucks is next door.We stayed on the 3rd floor so didn't have a probelm with the lift - we mainly used the stairs.I'd stay here again and happily recommend it to others."
26,1889,"Oct 30 2009	Don't Stay At This Hotel. They Are So Rude Impolite And Don't Care About Its Guest	A friend stayed at this hotel a weekend on Oct, 2009, and shed asked to send some packages to her (totally 7) and she went to Front Desk and Luggage Room and they gave her just one package. I tried to help her calling to the hotel and I talked with several different guys, all of them are very rude, impolite, really don't care about any guest's request, etc... the others 6 packages were not gave to her... one of hotel's employee told me that they faced a system problem during that weekend, that's why they didn't give her pakcages but all time that she asked about her packages, nobody knew where they were. After she left the hotel, they found it and when I asked them to send the her stuffs to the new hotel that she was, they asked my credit card number to charge me the expenses but who did the fault was THE HOTEL, not me or my friend. Now we really don't know where are her packages... when we try to contact someone in this hotel, they said that the packages were sent to her but they don't even give us a tracking number. It is its obligation to send the packages to her address as a FREE DOMICILE shipment but they really don't care about it. Also once I talked to the Executive Office Assistant and I though she was able to help me because she represents the hotel but for my surprise, she was the most rude person that I'd talked in this hotel. Now she is trying to get her stuffs but no one there helps... so if you don't want have a bad experience, I really encourage you to NEVER stay in this hotel."
27,1889,"Oct 30 2009 	Good Stay	Great location, over the NQR Subway. Found it a good base to get around. Good size rooms, however, the plumbing didn't work in the first room we were allocated. We moved to another room which was much older. We requested a move to a more updated room. We were asked to see a choice of rooms and we moved to a better one. The Starbucks is located on the corner of the hotel. Lot's of deli's around. We sampled some of them and thought they were all great. On checkout, the reception printed out our boarding passes which we thought was quite helpfull. Used the hotels black taxi to JFK on check-out. Got a good price and thought that it was a good treat."
28,1889,"Oct 29 2009 	Geared More for Tourists Than Business: Read Full Review to Better Help You Decide	Points of Concern?* Old style NY Hotel implies space-lacking rooms, designed to sleep, or socialize out-of-room and relax in lobby or on-the-town (can be charming for some, due to design, especially on vacation rather than business)?* No desk in room -- poor design for business travelers (no laptop room)?* Air Conditioning did not work in all of our rooms -- very hot; possibly turned-off for season?* Window proved challenging to open, but did give us some fresh air?* Accent table's lamp falling apart and wobbled when utilizing table surface?* Housekeeping's cleaning carts stored in hallways when not in-use?* Toilet maintenance day had units stored in hallways on multiple floors mid-afternoon, gone by evening (might not be a concern for some)?* Housekeeping pulled bottom sheet short so that tall people had their feet touching the actual mattress?* Curved shower rod rotated downward causing shower curtain to sag and 7&quot; gap on each end of rod?* No hot water first night; front desk called plumber; no difference second night; jiggle with faucet to find the 1 degree in 360 on faucet to provide tepid water?* Black scuff marks on wall; yes, the hotel is older, but could have splashed some cleaner or paint to cover??Points of Interest?* Water volume and pressure in shower acceptable?* Plenty of towels of good-to-high quality?* Big screen flat-panel TV?* In-room Internet--Ethernet (but fee-based)?* Lobby proved reasonably attractive and comfortable?* Wonderful stone facade at entrance* Good location within a couple of blocks of subway and very close to Carnegie Hall??From this, you can decide if this hotel will work for your needs. Happy traveling and enjoy NYC."
29,1889,"Oct 26 2009 	Great Location Nice Room Good Value	We liked this hotel...had a room on the 15th floor that was a good size facing the front of the hotel. It was nicely decorated, had a very comfortable king sized bed, seemed roomy from what I have heard about other hotels in NYC. We had a good rate as we booked early and were staying over five days. The location suited us perfectly as it is between Central park (a couple of blocks) and an easy walk to Broadway plays, Times Square and lots of restaurants. A subway stop is steps from the hotel entrance so that was very convenient. It didn't come with a coffee maker but we rented one for $10 which covered the week long stay. It has a nice fitness centre. The 2 people at the concierge's desk were very helpful."
30,1889,Oct 22 2009 	liked this hotel	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel although the location was not as good as we expected. Timesquare was several blocks away. Dont take the black cabs outside hotel as we were told that because we were staying at the hotel we were entitled to a complimentary ride in his cab but he actually ended up charging us double what a yellow cab would have. Thank you to pamela working in the bar for being so friendly. Also the tall gentleman porter who looked after us while we were waiting for our cab to take us to the airport.
31,1889,"Oct 21 2009 	""Do not stay at this hotel ....please !!!!!!!	paid extortionate rates to stay in this hotel with my wife on the October Bank Holiday weekend. 1970's style room with a bathroom that needs an urgent cleaning. Low and behold for all the money you pay at this place, there is no complimentary tea &amp; coffee and wi-fi access is charged at a daily extortionate rate. Honestly ....at least Attica State prison gives you complimentary coffee &amp; a clean bathroom. Do not waste your money ......................very very poor"
32,1889,"Oct 21 2009 	Loved it	I loved the hotel. I really loved it. Staff were so nice and friendly, Could not do enough for you. Room was clean big and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. It is so central to everything. 5 mins from everywhere."
33,1889,"Oct 20 2009 	FILTHY AND MATTRESSES ARE VERY VERY OLD AND UNCOMFORTABLE	The Park Central Hotel advertises that they are a luxury hotel. This hotel is far from being luxurious. The rooms were filthy, the restrooms smell of urine, the mattresses are extremely old and uncomfortable. The guests have to pay $14.99 for internet service and if you have to use the business center to print anything you still have to pay an additonal amount for internet service and pay for the cost of printing. The apples they give you at the front desk were rotten. Smokers are allowed to smoke at the entrance of the hotel where all guests are welcomed with the smell of smoke on their clothes as you walk into the their lobby. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy."
34,1889,"Oct 19 2009 	DO NOT stay at the Park Central 870 Seventh Avenue in NYC	October 10, 2009 We booked for 3 nights and stayed 1 night for several reasons. The air conditioner had been detached by the hotel and with no air circulatiion the room smelled like a swamp. The bathroom was in deplorable condition, the shower was covered in mildew, the kleenex holder was in pieces and the toilet paper was sitting next to the sink because the dispenser was broken. We did complain the the management and they did nothing. The room was a $99.00 room at best and we paid $460. I felt cheated in every way. DO NOT stay at The Park Central 870 Seventh Avenue in New York City."
35,1889,"Oct 18 2009 	Great Choice - Great location	If you can take advantage of their website offer of 169.00 then you just can't beat this hotel.Considering the high price of everything in manhatten, this is absolutely the BEST deal out there!!You will read mixed reviews of this hotel and it's interesting because I will explain why.I think some floors and rooms are better than others.We just spent 3 nights here. We met up with my inlaws who flew in from England 3 days before us. We came from Chicago and met them there. They were in the lobby waiting for us when we arrived and came up to the room with us. We had the same level of room they did (a standard double) but on a much higher floor. When we stepped off the elevator my father in law said &quot;This floor is much nicer than ours the carpet is plusher. When we got to the room the comparisons continued. We had ice bucket and glasses, a coffee maker and coffee and a desk and chair. He also said our lights were brighter? Well, I thought he was just being funny but when we went down to his room on the 5th floor I could see what he meant.It was the same room but it seemed older and shabbier.Our room was perfect. The bed was comfortable the pillows soft and it was absolutely SPOTLESS, I'm talking about the edges of the floor where the carpet met the wall. It looked brand new!. Also, the acid test for me is to walk around in a pair of white socks. That will tell you how clean a room is and trust me this was immaculate after 3 days the socks were still white. The bathroom was like new, no mold no dirt at all just shiny and clean.When ever we travel and get to a hotel room, my husband always says to me first thing &quot;before I unpack are we staying?&quot; Because if there is anything not right i always insist on moving and trust me its happened A LOT well within 10 seconds I had started to unpack. Another reviewer complained about the curtains not closing but if they had looked behind the sheers they would have seen the thick blackout shades which pull across and block out all the light. The windows have double pane glass so if you are up higher it is silent from street noise and that's something for manhatten. If I were paying the regular rate of up to 300 dollars a night then I would expect a fridge in the room and free internet but for the price I could live without.The location is absolutely phenomenalThe lobby is on the dark side but that's just the style of the hotel go to their website and look at the pictures and they don't lie.It was a perfect stay and I would go back."
36,1889,"Oct 16 2009 	Great location rest OK	The location couldn't be beat. Service was ok. There were 4 of us staying in one room but they kept giving us towels for 3. We requested extra several times but they didn't always come. We pre-requested a fridge and it wasn't there when we checked in. They also charged us $25 per day for the fridge when they had told us it was $25 for the whole stay. They took the charges off the bill though. Bathroom was a bit rundown: peeling wall paper, a little mold and weak water pressure. I think for the price and location though, it was a good deal. Not sure I'd stay there again."
37,1889,"Oct 15 2009 	We thought the lifts were brilliant!	We asked for a room high up (19th floor) and were not disappointed- we had fantastic views and could see the lights of Times Square, it was relatively quiet in that particular corner of the hotel. We checked in early and there were no problems- but realise that will not be the case for everyone. We had coffee making facilities and the bed was comfortable. We thought the lifts were great, it took 2 minutes to get the hang of it - they are super quick and dont seem to stop at every floor- which saves lots of time.There is a safe in the room which is reassuring. There is a subway on the doorstep. Neraby restaurants include Nougatine@ Jean Georges- dont miss it and Mariella Pizza for a quick slice of fantastic pizza on the go.On the downside, the toiletries seemed poor quality and aren't topped up during your stay."
38,1889,"Oct 15 2009 	A+ Location and Good Value	Spent one night here and was able to walk everywhere which was incredible because we had such little time in NYC. Rooms were not ready when we arrived. I thought because we were a corporate group they would be expecting us. We were giving one room to keep our bags, but this was not ideal after arriving off the red-eye. Hotel staff can not control availability though, so I sincerely do not hold this against them. This is a solid three star hotel. I do recommend it for those who want to see it all on a budget. Carnegie Deli next door, highly recommended for breakfast and central park as well! Its just down the street."
39,1889,Oct 10 2009 	Great location everything else is OK.	Stayed for one night while having my apartment exterminated. The location was great and we got a good rate on Hotwire. The room was clean but the walls were a bit scuffed. The walls in the bathroom could use a good scrubbing to remove some mold stains but overall it was clean. The one major issue we had was that the beds appeared to be shorter than average. At 5'11&quot; my feet were hanging off the edge of the bed. The luggage storage charge was bit annoying too.
40,1889,"Oct 10 2009 	Not Great	Stayed here for one night on our return from a cruise, arrived at the hotel at around 11.00am rooms are not available until 16:00 hours, we were charged $1.50 per bag to leave are bags until the room was available.This is a perfect location on 7th avenue, 5 mins until central park and 10 mins to Times Square.This hotel is a &quot;mansion block&quot; hotel with a nice lobby area, we had a room on the 16th floor, the hallway and rooms on this floor were very dated and in need of an update.In our room the curtains were designed not to close so no protection from the sunlight?The staff do not have a great attitude and had a take it or leave it attitude, we could not believe the morning we checked out we were in the room at 09:30 when the room cleaner knocked on the door when I answered I was &quot;told off&quot; for not placing an &quot;absolutely not&quot; sign on the door, I have only ever used a do not disturb sign when sleeping in or I wanted to use it, not for the convenience of the room cleaner!!Then the worst part of the experience after checking out at noon, we were charged $3.75 per bag (we had 4) to leave them for two hours until our taxi to the airport!!!!!!!!I complained and was told this was not part of the hotel (yer right) and also all hotels did this in New York, we stayed at the Crown Plaza before our cruise and have stayed at other hotels and never had this. We were given two bags free of charge but as I explained to the guest relationships this was no way to build relationships with customers!Think twice before staying here if you have other options."
41,1889,"Oct 6 2009 	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!	What a great hotel. Reception staff were friendly and helpful even letting us check in a little early. Several people seemed to have problems with the lifts, but we found them to be very easy to use and efficient. The room was clean when we got there and was kept up to a good standard throughout our week long stay. The bed was comfy and BIG, plenty of storage space and an adundance of towels and toiletries. The only complaints we had were the lack of decent water pressure and no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room. I wasnt expecting to be charged for storing luggage after checking out but it was less than $4 so not the end of the world. The airline check-in facility was a nice touch.We had a corner room on the 11th floor and had great views towards Times Square, Central Park and my favourite, Carnegie Hall. It is very well located, the Park being practically on the doorstep and Times Sq being a short walk away. We recommend the Citysights NY tour, it was great value and very informative. Make sure you try La Parisienne for breakfast, just a couple of blocks towards Central Park, great pancakes, and the steak and eggs are to die for.I've recommended the Park Central to my sister for her holiday next year as I dont think you can beat it for value and location. We booked on Hotwire and got a great deal.I would be careful though, I heard that Albert Anastasia was shot in the barber shop :0 (Ask Google!)"
42,1889,"Oct 6 2009 	Loved this place!!!	We stayed for 5 nights and really loved the place. Location is excellent, central park and time square within 10 minutes walk, we hardly used any public transport. Also just down the street is the carnegie deli which does the best and biggest cheesecake i have ever had!!! The hotel is modern, clean and the staff were helpful and polite. Sure the lift system is not typical but is that really a big deal? I never waited that long for a lift and they weren't slow (we were on the 20th floor) Room was cleaned every day and the bed was confortable. After another hotel had messed up our booking (morningside inn) we had little choice but to go to this hotel, i am soooo thankful to them as this hotel was perfect!!!"
43,1889,"Oct 6 2009 	Excellent hotel and great value!	Great location, good clean rooms. I have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone. The best thing was the value - we booked on hotwire and got a great deal for such an amazing hotel. The only minus was that wireless was not included."
44,1889,"Oct 5 2009	DON'T STAY AT PARK CENTRAL	We took our mother for her first time to NY for her 65th birthday. We were excited about the whole idea. We decided to stay at a centrally location and willing to pay the price to be close to all the excitements. After checking in, we were very disappointed to find out that we had to SHARE A KING SIZE BED AMONG THE THREE OF US. . We booked over a month ahead of time and paid for 3 adults so we were surprised that they did not have a proper room reserved for us. We did requested two beds for the next day. We were glad to have 2 beds for the remaining of our stay so for the next few nights, we left tips for the cleaning lady hoping to have a clean room when we return. We were wrong, the cleaning ladies were outside our room every morning waiting for us to leave to collect the tips. Our beds were made and we got new towels but nothing else. Our ice bucket was never cleaned for the 7 nights, carpet not vacuumed, bathroom not cleaned, shower curtain smell. We stopped tipping after the 3rd nights. On this day, nothing was done in our room, no cleaning, no towels, no bed making, nothing.... We called the front desk, we had to wait over 2 hours just to get new towels. After arriving late to our room, having to wait for another 2 hour was long. The hallways on every floor had very strong dog smell. Staffs were not friendly. The only thing we like was the location. We will never stay at Park Central again. The pros and cons:Pros: The location.Cons: Smelly hallway, Smelly room, smelly shower curtain, old furniture, uncomfortable bed. small and slow elevator."
45,1889,"Oct 5 2009 	Excellent value for a beautiful hotel	Let's start with location - who could ask for anything better than this hotel offers. Easy walk to the Park, Columbus Cir, Times Square, etc. Additionally, the hotel has an extremely sophisticated look and rooms that, by NYC standards at least, are quite large. As far as the logistics of a hotel- cleanliness, promptness of service, navigatability, etc. - I have nothing but praise for them. Oh, and I found the staff to be professional, personable and courteous. I had a brief stay this trip but look forward to booking a room at the Park Central when I can stay a little longer."
46,1889,"Oct 2 2009	Treated Very Badly	I have stayed at this hotel and recommended it but when my group (3 women including a senior) went to check into our rooms we were notified that the hotel was over booked and they were moving us to their other property near Times Square, the Paramount. When we complained about the location (as we wanted to be near the park and away from the chaos of TImes Square) and asked for compensation (because the Paramount is cheaper) we were skillfully moved out of the hotel lobby and asked to wait 10 minutes for a ride to the other hotel. All further attempts to communicate have been ignored."
47,1889,"Oct 2 2009 	Great location but was room wasn't as clean as it could be	While the location of this hotel can't be beat for the price, the room I had left me wishing I spent a little more for a cleaner room. The shower has mold in several areas as does some of the bathroom walls. Generally the room doesn't feel as clean as it could be and being on the 8th floor with my window facing 55th St, the street noise and Saturday night club kept me awake late into the night. I doubt I would stay here again."
48,1889,"Sep 30 2009 	Great location but smelly room	We stayed in room 1136 in late August. Overall the hotel is in a great location, close to the subway and within walking distance to all the major attractions. The hotel staff were ok but the major compliant was the room's smell. When we entered the room we were hit with a musty damp smell. We did not spend alot of time in our room because we were in NYC to see the sights. It wasn't worth our time etc to change rooms for a 4 night stay. We felt it was not since we did not spend much time in it other than to sleep. But how can this hotel in all good conscience rent out this room knowing that it smells so bad????"
49,1889,"Sep 29 2009 	Great location but in need of renovation.	I have stayed here twice in the last couple years. The first time they put us in a dark and dingy room and I immediately went back down to reception to ask for another room. I was pleasantly surprised when they gave us a much bigger corner room with a view of times square! The second time I stayed there, same situation even though I requested a corner room months in advance I was given a dingy, stained carpeted, moldy smelling room. They were not accommodating &amp; could not give me another room because the hotel was full. BS. On the positive side, the location couldn't be better. All the Broadway shows are just around the corner &amp; times square is walking distance. We never felt unsafe walking around at night and the subway is just steps away. Also the beds were pretty comfortable. Just be pushy with them to get a better room if you are given a dingy one. We found the best pizza in NY is Lombardi's! Try it! Also Carnegi deli is really good (best pastrami sandwiches) &amp; it's pretty much next door."
50,1889,"Sep 28 2009 	Good location charge erroneously services	The location of the hotel is simply great. Few steps and you are in Time Square, fewer than that and you get Central Park. It is fairly clean and the people are kind. Very useful tourist information desk.I have only one thing for which I do not recommend this hotel: when I checked out there was a mistake in the bill that had been easily clarified at the reception desk (They charged me a meal that I did not have; eventually we find out that the signature in the bill was not the signature of mine but of someone else that gave the waiter the wrong room number.)The problem was that my credit card has been charge by the hotel twice, for the right amount and for an additional (I guess wrong) charge that was exactly the amount of the meal. I tried to contact them several time via the form of the website but I did received no reply at all. I only asked about the reason of that charge (for which they do not have any bill with my signature)! Actually the additional charge was less than 20 bucks, but what if they wrongly charged me for more? And why they do not reply to my emails... this is not good at all."
51,1889,"Sep 26 2009 	Meh. It's not as bad as others say but remains a very bad option in NYC.	I stayed here for 5 nights earlier this month and have nothing particularly nice to say about it. The hotel itself is very well-located which is the only plus. The lobby is newly renovated and decent but once you make way for the elevators, you quickly realize what kind of place you're staying in. The elevators are exceptionally slow - typical for an old hotel in any city, as this one is - and the corridors fairly small. My floor smelled like urine in the hallway for the 5 days I was there, not pleasant. The rooms are dingy and musty. Despite a fresh coat of paint and new carpet, the hotel looks scummy and more than well-worn. The shower had no pressure and minimally hot water, except the occasional flash of boiling-temp that made the shower a fun experience. I held up one of the glass tumblers before pouring myself a glass of bottled water to find lipstick and smear marks on it - clearly it had not been cleaned with anything more than a towel since I don' t know when. There is nothing that would ever compel me to stay in this hotel again. I was very disappointed and very grateful for my late nights in the office so I didn't have to spend more time than needed here."
52,1889,"Sep 25 2009 	STAY AWAY!!!	Hotel, by FAR the most disgusting hotel have ever stayed at. There was MOLD ALL OVER (not just in the bathroom, but on the curtains!). The staff were a bunch of nasty jerks. Except the housekeeping women, they were nice.The best and most ridiculous story...my girlfriend sent me a fruit basket with specific instructions to deliver it to my room. Well, after working 17 hours straight I noticed a message on my phone (which did not work of course, and could not retrieve the message) - she told me about the basket....I called the lobby - no answer. I travel DOWNSTAIRS in my boxers and dress shoes and find someone who gets the basekt for me - and CHARGES ME $4 DOLLARS!!!! They said it was because they had to store it. The guy was nasty about it too.Also, menu says room service til 10pm...not true they close at 9:45 but do not reflect this on my menu. The bed is OLD and uncomfortable The elevators stink. The room smells. There is no signage in the lobby as to what is where. I hung a sign on my room for service please and nobody came til 4pm! There high speed internet access was SLOW. By far the worst hotel I have EVER stayed at - would rather have slept in Central Park with the homeless."
53,1889,"Sep 24 2009 	Excellent! All you need!	Excellent! Be careful with all the negative evaluation about this hotel posted here. I agree that some rooms and floors are lucky to be assisted by better housekeepers than others, but in a overall view the hotel is great. The location is fantastic! The front desk, in the name of Michael, was extremely helpfull and gentle and the people from the luggage storage as well. The lift is &quot;very intelligent&quot; and it is not slow definitely. People just need to understand the way it works and it is very simple. You don't need a brain &quot;upgrade&quot;. I had a wonderful stay there. I will return certainly and I recomend it for anyone."
54,1889,"Sep 24 2009 	For the money go somewhere else.	Stayed here with my wife for seven nights. New York is brilliant. This hotel is OK, just OK. Got to the hotel at 1pm, tired but couldn't check in til 4pm. Room was ok but damp smell in the cupboard where clothes were to be hung. The condition of the room was that of an average hotel not what would be expected of a hotel where the average nightly cost was 180-190 pounds. There was no bath only a shower. No tea/coffee making facilities, no fridge/bar in room. The mattrass had seen better days and was uncomfortable. The main problem was the view, or lack of. The room was in the middle of the hotel with a window looking out on to an inner courtyard and other rooms and permanently in darkness. It was necessary to have the lights on all day to see anything as virtually no daylight came in. Really if you are able to spend this sort of money shop around for something better I am sure you wouldn't have to look far."
55,1889,"Sep 22 2009 	Dog Hotel	This hotel was not very clean. We had to ask the maid to clean the bathroom really well. My biggest problem was the hotel never mentions that they allow dogs to stay there on its website. Nor, did the hotel advise you of this when you checked into it or gave an option of not sleeping on the same floor with dogs. I am a big dog lover but I do not want to stay in a hotel with dogs. Hotels are notorious for not being clean and dogs add their own germs to the environment. My friend has allergies and this was not a good environment for her. A hotel that allows dogs should advertise for all who do not want to or can not stay in that kind of environment. Also, the staff was rude and not very helpfull."
56,1889,"Sep 21 2009 	Great hotel and location for the price!	I recently bought reservations via Priceline for the Park Central. Since it was my first time in New York City I had no expectations other than those given to me by other people. I was told our hotel room would be small and cramped and very expensive. And that since I had made my reservation on Priceline that I would get the worst room and treatment. I found the opposite to be true. The rooms were very spacious, clean and the hotel staff was very accomodating. Through Priceline you don't get to specify the type of room you want so I was told I would get stuck with a King-size bed unless we paid extra. This was not the case. The Front desk person asked if we'd like two double beds, I said yes and we were not charged extra. That in itself was a nice surprise. I loved it's central location and would definitely reccomend it to friends!"
57,1889,"Sep 21 2009 	Manhattan minus the rip-off price tag	We have never been to America, and were determined to find a hotel in NYC that would serve as an excellent base so we could walk everywhere, or get on the subway. When we arrived in NYC, we caught a bus and alighted at Port Authority Bus Terminal, and actually walked to the hotel, passing by Times Square. The room is more than sufficient! Large comfy bed and all the typical fixtures and appliances. Everything you associate with NYC is within reach of this hotel - Central Park, street fare, Times Square, Broadway, Cargnegie etc etc etc. Don't expect the staff to fall over you - we were actually quite happy to do our thing - we weren't in contact with staff much but the room was serviced daily, and this suited us just fine! If you need the subway, yellow line stop is right by the side entrance of the hotel. Happy travelling!!"
58,1889,Sep 18 2009 	Dirty Rooms and A/C did not cool	The rooms were dirty - bathroom walls were not wiped down. There were hairs everywhere and then only had 1 towel. I had to call and ask for more towels and then wait close to an hour to have them delivered. The walls are paper thin as well. Will not stay here again. Only positive - location.
59,1889,Sep 18 2009 	Location... Location... Location...	We arrived to the hotel after a long flight and an extra long wait in JFK at immigration and was longing to flop in a comfortable room! We had requested a non-smoking room - and our room smelled very strongly of smoke. Reception were unable to move us to another room that night as the hotel was fully booked but offered to freshen our room - so they opened a window!!!! The room was more than adequate in size - if a little shabby... We didnt eat or drink at the hotel so we cannot comment on the service or food there - but the concierge desk was very well manned (or womaned as the case maybe) and I found the staff there very informative and helpful.The location of this hotel is definately it's best selling point - there is a subway station located next to the hotel and there are numerous cafes located within a minutes walk. Also Times Square and Central Park are on your doorstep.Overall - a bit on the pricey side - but it's location compensates for any complaints we had
60,1889,"Sep 18 2009 	I have never had a worse experience at a hotel	Everything about the Park Central hotel was awful. From the moment I got there and had to deal with the mess they call &quot;valet parking&quot; I was annoyed. The staff at the front desk could not have been more rude. I have never seen anything like it- they acted like I was bothering them when I wanted to check-in, check-out or borrow a pen to sign for the food I had delivered. It is an expensive hotel too-- people are paying good money to stay there and the staff needs to be given a seminar on hospitality. The room smelled too, and felt dirty. The carpet hadn't been vaccumed the entire 5 days we were there. I never write reviews on anything but I am so angry about my experience there that I am taking the time to make sure everyone knows: DON'T STAY AT THE PARK CENTRAL, NY!!!"
61,1889,"Sep 17 2009 	FANTASTIC!!	The staff was extremely friendly. The lobby, the lounge and the room were spotless. We had booked online thru the hotel's website and had requested a suite upgrade if possible. We were given a huge (for New York) suite on the 25th floor staring right at Times Square for only $40 a night more. I have already booked our next trip at this hotel and will be returning any time our travel takes us to Manhatten."
62,1889,"Sep 16 2009 	Good if the price is right!	A group of six of us stayed here for six nights from Aug 31 to Sept 6. This was my second time to stay here and we got a spectacular rate of $88 plus tax per night. For a good deal the Park Central is good value. The location is brilliant, the beds are comfy, the rooms are a decent size. However there are a few issues which could be improved upon. Our room did smell a bit musty, not enough to request a move but noticeable. The room was always well cleaned, a few bucks to the maid always helps with this! The elevator system can be a pain but once you use the allocated lift isn't that big a deal. The public areas are decent enough. We were allowed to check in early on request which was nice. The front desk staff were pleasant on arrival. One of our group had the same issue of no towels in the room. The only thing that really annoyed me was when it came to check out. It transpired that the hotel had put a $100 per day hold on our card in addition to the cost of the room. As we were continuing our holiday afterwards this was very inconvenient. At no time were we informed that they would put this hold in place and as it was a holiday weekend it took a few days to clear. The lady I dealt with on checkout was very rude and unhelpful on this matter. All other staff we encountered were very pleasant. I was there the night the fire alarm went off and I was very satisfied with the system they have in place to keep guests informed. Its a shame they only make their announcements in english as I had to explain what was being said to some people who didn't speak english. Overall an ok stay though, I would probably return if I got the same deal in the future."
63,1889,"Sep 13 2009 	The Best Hotel in NYC!!!	My father and I travelled to NYC for the first time during july 09. After a lot of internet research i finally decided on the Park Central. I had read a variety of reveiws and was quite dubious about my stay however on arrival i was blown away. Our room was on the 4th floor and had two clean, comfortable double beds. The bathroom was quite substantial and spotless clean. The TV was huge and easy to work. We had a window that opened about ten inches which was very pleasent and displayed a nice view of 56th street. The location couldn't be better. The flashing neon lights of times square could be seen two hundred meters to you right and the same distance to Central Park on your left. The double decker bus tours are well worth it. It is a fabulous way to see all the sights of new york. Unlike some big cities the traffic moves fast and it is a very pleasent ride. The Ellis Island and staue of liberty tour is only $15 and is a must!!The cheapest, quickest and simplest was to get here from the airports is by the NY yellow cabs. its $45 flat rate from airports. So if there is more that one traveller the cabs are the easiest and cheapest way (unless you feel like trying to figure out the rail system). food is cheap and nice around NYC (we didn't use the hotel resteaunt however it aways looked nice and occupied)We did not use the subway because the Park Central is so wonderfully located. Everywhere is easily accessable by foot and there is just soooo much to see. I couldn't recommend the park Central more!!!!i could not have asked for anything more. I will definatly be staying at the park central again!!"
64,1889,"Sep 10 2009 	Great location but...	The hotel is in a great location, but the hotel needs some help. I arrived late, and was told they did not have the King room I reserved, so they would have to give me a room with 2 beds. I had reserved a non-smoking room, but the room I was given smelled very strongly like smoke - in fact, the entire hallway did. Most of the buttons on the phone didn't work, but I managed to call the front desk who told me I definitely had a non-smoking room and they were unable to move me. People were clearly smoking in the adjoining room, and the smoke came right under the door. The floor did not appear to be vacuumed. I ordered room service, which cost $53 for a salad, a grilled cheese, and bottled water, and the food was horrible. In the morning, after taking a shower, I discovered that they had forgotten to put towels in the room. Most of the furniture was worn and dirty. I paid over $400 a night to stay there (which I know is not extremely high by New York standards), but it was definitely not worth it."
65,1889,"Sep 7 2009 	Great Location	Hi just got back from a six night stay at the Central Park Hotel. The location was great, being so close to Times Square and Central Park. Our room was suprisingly spacious with a great comfy bed. The lifts at the hotel are a bit slow with a stupid system which meant - say if you were going to floor 11 and the lift was set to go to floor 10, instead of you pressing 11 and going to 11 it would stop at 10 then return to the Lobby and then go back up to 11. ( If that makes any sense) But we did get the hang of it. The hotel did charge us to store our suitcase the day of departure which was a bit of a cheap trick but apart from that Id highly recommend the place."

67,1889,Sep 3 2009 	Fantastic Location .....Great price ...Thoroughly enjoyed our stay	We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of August.Got a great deal on the internetStayed in a Concierge King room.Keep looking on their website as prices are changing virtually every week(cancelled my first two reservations and rebooked as price kept changing ...almost 50% reduction on original price I was quoted) .Ideal location for most of the sights.All of the staff were great and had no problem with the lifts.Overall great value and would recommend this hotel !!!!
68,1889,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Location	After reading the reviews on here i was a bit worried about going to this hotel, But when we got there we happy with what we gotThe room was of a good size, staff were more then help fullWe had trouble with the heating called reception and they sent some one to fix it straight away!Hotel was a 10 minute walk to times square, central Park and 5th AveWould definitely go back to this hotel again!"
69,1889,"Aug 28 2009 	Fantasitc location	pluses: Subway entrance, in front of the hotel etrance. 3 min walk to the Central Park.5 min walk to the Times Square.7 min walk to 5h Avenue.Starbucks next door :Pminuses: Bad elevator service. (There are many floors and we often had to get on our floor by feet) Very expensive breakfast. (25 $ per person)"
70,1889,"Aug 26 2009 	Abysmal Quality waste of money extremely rude staff	Ok, here is the story. The front of the hotel where you get dropped off is not bad considering its location, however it still lacks a drive way so you'd have to get off the road quickly with all your luggage. My family and I arrived a few hours early for check in, and it really annoyed me to find out that we had to store our luggage in a storage for $3.5 each. When we finally checked in, they gave us a corner room on the 4th floor where the hallway was extremely dirty and smelled like mold. To make things worse, they gave us a room with mold everywhere, non working Air conditioner, and the whole room smelled like armpit (literally). We got our room changed, where I found out that wireless internet was $14 a day. Overall, the stay there was absolutley abysmal considering the amount we pay, I would NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to anyone in my branch of connections. I don't even wanna tell you guys about the fight I had with the manager.I was SO disappointed."
71,1889,"Aug 23 2009 	Great Location - Poor Ventilation	We were surprised by the size of our room, which was a little larger than we had expected for New York. The service varied, most staff were very professional and helpful, but one young lady at the check in was extremely rude to another customer when I was in line. Our room was humid, smelly, hot and over looked a service space that was littered with garbage. A view I will never miss. I asked if a drain and the air to be fixed and the drain worked after. The air worked okay for a day but just likely could not keep up with the humidity and the heat. We booked an internet special - and it included breakfast. The buffet was very good - but only if it is included. It was not a $25 breakfast. Take the stairs in the morning; getting an elevator is a long, long wait."
72,1889,"Aug 21 2009 	Great Location good price	Overall our stay at the hotel was good, it's NYC so you don't spend much time in your room other than to sleep!! The elevators are a bit weird but they ran quickly and we had no problems. The rooms could use some updating, there were water-marks on the ceiling and some of the wallpaper was peeling, carpets coming up etc, but the tv was a nice flat screen and the bed was comfortable.Walking distance to Times Square and we even walked down to the Gerswhin to see Wicked---which I HIGHLY reccommend! :0)"
73,1889,"Aug 21 2009 	Great Location	We stayed for 5 night at the end of July and found the hotel to be very good. One issue they have is that they dont explain properly to guests how to use the elevators. Before we left I saw lots of reviews about this issue and although i wasnt told by front desk, i pretty much worked it out for myself but had to explain the procedure to quite a few other guests how to use them. Overall we were very happy with the place."
74,1889,"Aug 19 2009 	Great place in a walking distance from Time Square!	Nice hotel, but could have been better. Overcharged my credit card, so I had a bit of a problem with that... But it seems to be kind of usual in the states. The hotel's situation was really great, though, as it was near everything. Great views of Manhattan, although some rooms could be a bit noisy. I liked it."
75,1889,Aug 18 2009 	great location	the hotel in a great location close to time square the staff was very friendly the elevators are small and our room was a little smelly the carpets where dirty and stained. all and all though it was a pretty nice hotel just a little pricey
76,1889,"Aug 18 2009 	Avoid this place!! (Overflowing toilet people sleeping in lobby hallways...)	We stayed at the Park Central New York for 3 nights in August as part of family vacation with 2 kids. The hotel was booked via Expedia. We found this hotel to be absolutely the worst value for the top dollars they are charging. I have found better service at 1 star motels charging $ 40/night than this place.This was the worst hotel experience we ever had in our life with some of the following issues :  - Overflowing toilet : On our last day in the morning, the toilet started overflowing with dirty water spilling all over the bathroom floor. Despite repeated calls, nobody showed up at the room for almost 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the plumber who showed up simply plunged the toilet but nobody came to clean the bathroom. Finally, the house cleaning showed up after another 30 minutes but did not carry any cleaning supplies. Since we had to catch the flight we simply had to pack up and leave the room without stepping into the bathroom. While I can understand that plumbing can malfunction, the management's response was absolutely pathetic. Manager and front desks simply did not want to deal with the situation in spite of repeated calls. - The hotel has benches between the lobby and guest elevator. We found that people were simply sleeping on these benches during the day and we had to pass them while going to our rooms. The people who were sleeping were NOT tourists or hotel guests but looked like homeless people from street who simply wanted to rest on a nice benches. It was evident that nobody from the hotel management was bothered about these sleeping people. We are paying top dollars for staying at a good place but the area looked more like an old Greyhound station.- When we checked in, the receptionist simply told us that there are no non-smoking rooms available. When I explained that they need to figure out how to provide me a room, the receptionist simply went inside and came back and gave us a non-smoking room. It was clear to me that the hotel had non-smoking rooms but the receptionist simply wanted to dump a smoking room on us. While the location for the hotel is good, the place has too many problems- non responsive management, lack of customer service, very small rooms. Please avoid this dump in NY at any cost. It simply not worth it- especially with the price you are paying. I am also surprised that Expedia is recommending this as one of the recommended hotel."
77,1889,"Aug 18 2009 	Fantastic location and good all round	Stayed two nights 12/13 August. Room was very clean. Bed was excellent and got two great nights' sleep.Had a good corner view of 7th Avenue.Reception staff did seem a litte unwelcoming initially on arrival, but once check-in done, they were very welcoming and friendly.Cleaning staff were lovely and gave us extra towels.Thought the bag leaving service was great and didn't mind paying for the convenience.Once we understood how the lifts work and get the right set for our floor, they weren't a problem at all.If you're travelling to the airport, my only tip would be check with the cars outside the hotel before getting the concierge to book the shuttle bus, which is much more expensive if there are a few in your party.The hotel arranged tickets for the Empire State Building and charged us the same price as if we'd bought them elsewhere.I'd happily stay there again."
78,1889,"Aug 17 2009 	Completely satisified	Michael was helpful at check-in, even though we could not get into our room until 4 pm, we stored our luggage for a minimal fee. My 14 year old daughter and I were on the 8th floor (Room 806) and had a great view as we requested when we made our reservation several months ago. Taking the elevators to/from the 8th floor was breeze. I thought the Lobby had a funny smell to it (musty). Our room was very nice, king bed and plenty of room for our bags. It was nice having a safe in the room. Michael gave us a suggestion of a convenience store where we could buy bottled water. The drinking water at all the restaurants was actually very good. Don't eat at Lindy's -- it's expensive and food is just average. The restaurants are great on 9th Avenue (between 56th and 44th). Excellent food, less expensive, more frequented by &quot;locals&quot;. We enjoyed Mangia e Bevi (Italian) and the Eatery (contemporary) -- both on 9th, near 53rd??? Da Nico in Little Italy is also very good. Shopping in Chinatown was a blast. Purses, jewelry and sunglasses were a steal. Used the subway to get around the city. It was fun exploring Soho and 5th Avenue. Top of the Rock was great and within walking distance. Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty was interesting, but I'd recommend buying a ticket (online) for the exact day you want to go. We purchased a flex ticket which allowed us to go anytime during a 3 day period, but we waited in line over an hour to get on the ferry. Got 40% discount for Mamma Mia at TKTS and loved the show! Winter Garden Theatre was very close to Park Central. Our first trip to NYC was amazing! I was very satisfied with Park Central and the location and we will visit again."
79,1889,"Aug 15 2009 	GREAT location RUDE staff HIGH prices OKAY room	This was our second stay at the Park Central and will definetly be our last. I booked 3 rooms for August. I asked for early check in as some of our family were arriving earlier than the 4 pm check-in. When we arrived we noticed that the lobby had been completely redone, very nice, however it did not make up for the a**hole we had to deal with at check-in. We asked if our other family members had arrived and were told that was a security issue and he couldn't tell us. After a long arguement he did call their room and said there was no answer so either they hadn't checked in or they were out. ** We found out later our family had left an important message for us at the desk which we received they day we checked out!**We were told we had to return at 4 pm as our room wouldn't be ready until then but we could leave our bags in the &quot;secure&quot; area, however the FEE to do this is $3.75 per bag. I'm thinking with the $200+ per night per room (plus extra for internet) we were paying this was a bit ridiculous.We ended up having to speak to a manager and she put us in a room that was ready (not the original one intenede for us) so everyone with us stored their luggage there.The room smelled bad, the bathroom was moldy, the shower handle was broken, the tub plug didn't work, the sink plug didn't work. The room was tiny and the King bed didn't quite look big enough, The view was the other side of the hotel - brick with windows all around and an empty &quot;pit&quot; in the centre. I asked the cleaning staff to please exchange the feather pillows for foam, I was told to ask the front desk, which I did. We were there for 4 nights - I NEVER got a foam pillow (I exchanged one with other family) nothing ever gets fixed and it is very annoying.The only thing that was good was the breakfast, hot and cold choices but expensive at $35 each. Our favorite waiter was Winston, he was the friendliest guy there - I think they should give him a job at the front desk :)So while the location was great, it isn't enough to make me return a third time."
80,1889,"Aug 14 2009 	Great Location Friendly staff but not a Great Hotel	Stayed with this hotel for 7 days and it is a pretty decent hotel, I wouldnt call it cheap or expensive, probably around the mid average price if you can find a good deal that is.The Lobby is really nice, really large and spacious! Clean and tidy! But beware even with a huge long reception desk there is always a long queue, standing in line and having opened ears you hear pretty amazing things and many many complaints by guests.My room was ok, on the 24th floor, fabulous view!!! I wouldnt exactly call it a birds eye view, If you tilted you head you would see a bit of the upper east side other than that your direct view was another building!The room was known as a large Concierge King a disabled one I might add, large and just renovated. I paid between $300 - $599 as the price was different each day. Some of the lamp sockets were broken which was already known by the technicians and receptionists but yeah the still decided to stick someone in there and plus the shower holder was broken so having a shower in one hand and a soap in the other wasnt very practical! After one complaint I got a free breakfast, the first experience of breakfast in the hotel was also the last, I only feel sorry for those who actually pre paid breakfast as an extra!There is a business centre so you can email, book and print your own stuff i.e. shows on Broadway! Concierge was also ok; they do their job but charge high prices doing it.The lifts always get stuck so if you are afraid of small spaces maybe its best you should book on a lower floor. I remember this hotel more of been stuck in the lift cramped with another 6 people somewhere on the 11th floor for 6 hours on new years eve, something to do with the outer door not opening nor could they open it. I guess you can say those memories are priceless.The staff I do have to say are very friendly especially the night staff, I got some really good tips about new York and Haarlem from the cleaners, the night porters and receptionists and really nice down to earth people to chat to. Honestly the staff does their job and they really do a good one at it."
81,1889,"Aug 12 2009 	Oh boy newer going back there.	The doors and elevator didnt work, there was mould in the bathroom. The noise of the cleening personal in the morning was frustrating.They took dubble internet fee, even if they promised to fix it earlier. I had to correkt them on check out! So I will not go back there again and I will not recommend it for enybody. Not on that price for 200$ at night."
82,1889,"Aug 11 2009 	great location - shame about the service!	Brilliant location! Reasonably priced! Good gym!The only issue was that the cleaners did not once vaccuum our room once! We stayed there 8 nights and nearly every day i asked someone to fix the plug on our bath and it was never done! i had to D.I.Y it! Also the toilet did not flush unless you held the lever for about 30 seconds! Also air con was dodgy and i was promised it would be fixed. It never was!Also the charged for baggage storage - first time ive ever come across this - it was a bit of a low blow!Also the taxi driver who was supposed to drive us to the airport the day we left was a driver used by the hotel (his name was eric i think), had a disagreement with us - so he decied to call me the F word and an SOB!!! I know its NYC but come on!"
83,1889,"Aug 11 2009 	Great location didnt really like the room.	Great location, i was expecting something a bit better as it was my 21st and the rooms on the website looked alot nicer. I found some of the staff quite miserable and rude, and the breakfast was a really expensive. But other than that i'd probably stay here again but only because of the location, as its only a 2 minute walk away from times square and applebees!!! =o) I loved new york and will defo go there again (when i have saved up to go mad on shopping again) Woodbury common is one of the main places to go!!!! Also try marriott marquis hotel, when we were over we got discount for this from the hop on , hop off bus reciept!! check this receipt it has loads of discount. the marriott marquis is the revolving restaurant in NY above times square, its pricey but it HAS to be done!! go before 9 o clock or they charge u per hour u are there if you are not resident there.Stardust diner is a place you have to go and see also, if you ahve children or just fancy a happy breakfast!! The waiters and waitresses dance and sing for you whilst serving you, lovely environmenty but it depends on what you like =o)"
84,1889,"Aug 7 2009 	Location	I arrived at the hotel two hours before the check-in time and they checked me in right away. The room is spacious and comfortable (great bed). The safe, however, didn't work at all... The AC worked well and the flatscreen TV was nice. The bathroom was clean, but it got too steamy, for the lack of ventilation.The elevators were easy to use, but I must say that I had read about it here beforehand, so I didn't have problems. Some people were confused and there was always someone lloking lost in front of them.The location is the best thing about PC, by far. Several subway stations nearby, bus stops and walking distance to 5th Ave, Central Park, Times Square and so on.Would stay there again for sure."
85,1889,"Aug 4 2009 	Great location - and perfect hotel	We stayed at Park Central Hotel for three nights and were very pleased with our stay.For tourists the location is all you can ask for. Walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, 5th Avenue, Times Square.The room was comfy and clean, and spacious enough for a family with two children of 7 and 9 years.The services at front desk was very good, both when we arrived and when we checked out.The only thing we could complain about was the air-conditioning in our room. It made an h**l of lot of noise. And the cold wind stood out of it. We had to fasten the curtains with a clothes pin to keep them together and keep the room a little less windy.But when we go back to New York in a few years were definitely staying at Park Central again."
86,1889,Aug 2 2009 	Ok hotel with a good location	Location was very good and beds were ok. The smell in the room was horrible and the floor was wet in front of the window.
87,1889,"Jul 28 2009 	Great Location Great Price	When I booked this room for such a great price, I was skeptical. I had never stayed in a hotel in NY, and had heard horror stories. I was pleasantly surprised with the Park Central Hotel. I was in NY for a wedding, and it proved to be a great location. Right near Carnegie Hall, very walkable to Central Park, Times Square, etc. Room was surprisingly spacious. I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to NY for the weekend!"
88,1889,"Jul 27 2009 	Great location decent hotel	Location, location, location! Walking distance from a lot of major attraction (Times Square, Central Park, 5th Av, etc. Hotel itself was okay. No mini bar though. I stayed on the 14th floor and had to walk down because the fire alarm went off. Mobile phone connection was terrible. Restaurant has the worst service..."
89,1889,"Jul 24 2009 	Bad communication	This is the first time I am compelled to leave a review for a hotel even before staying there. I made a reservation for 9 nights for what I thought was a none refundable free breakfast included fair. Immediately after making the reservation I discovered that due to the confusing nature of the hotel's website I booked a different fair so I sent an email to the hotel requesting to change my reservation. This was July 11th. Only on July 14th I received an answer from the hotel informing me that the package is not available any more and that I should have booked this package until the 12th. I replied that I did in fact contact the hotel on time, on July 11th, but the hotel staff still refuse to offer me that package. Now I am asked to pay an extra $40 a day only because they did not answer my email on time. Go figure."
90,1889,Jul 21 2009 	LocationLocation and price	I stayed at the Park Central Hotel the week of July 9. I stayed 3 nights and 4 days. The price was good and the room was sqeaky clean. I had a soft bed and great view from the 12th floor. The restaurant offered good food and incredible service. You step outside and you are blocks from everything!! the tour buses even stop in front of the hotel. You can't beat it.Note to the hotel manager: the lobby should have a sign at the counter like: Please wait here- somewhere in the middle of the long desk counter.
91,1889,"Jul 20 2009 	Great value hotel in a central location	My husband and I stayed here in early July.Check-in was great - fast and easy. Our room was suprisingly spacious (I'd heard NYC rooms were generally small) and we were able to easily fit our two big suitcases and walk around with plenty of room.We had a King bed that was pretty comfortable with lots of pillows. There was also a desk &amp; chair and an armchair. The flat-screen TV was nice. We didn't notice any street noise from our room.The bathroom was a decent size and pretty clean, although the shower hasn't been cleaned completely because I could see some shampoo or soap residue on the shower wall. The bathroom products were cheap-looking and didn't include conditioner, but we had brought our own anyway. There was no fan in the bathroom which meant it got pretty steamy.The AC worked really well and cooled the room down very quickly. There was a safe in the closet, but we had trouble unlocking it twice and had to call security up to fix it. They were really prompt (less than 5 mins) each time so that was good, but we decided not to use the safe anymore after that, as it was too much hassle.Elevators were fine - we never had to wait more than a minute.The location of this hotel is awesome for a tourist. 5 mins walk to Times Square and 2-3 mins to the South end of Central Park. Subway stations right outside the hotel. Also a Starbucks &amp; Subway sandwich shop on the same block. Lots of cafes and souvenir shops close by.Overall, we thought this hotel was excellent value. We booked directly on the hotel website and paid a very low price. We searched a lot and couldn't find any other Manhattan hotels in the same price range. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for good value."
92,1889,"Jul 19 2009	Camp beds	I made our 3 night booking on the Park Central website, I booked a Times Sq View room for 3 adults. I paid extra for the view. When we arrived and saw the room, view was good - but only one bed ! So off I went to queue again at reservations to be told that another bed would be brought to us, it would be a fold away bed! I explained that our teenage daughter needed a 'real' bed and that was my requirements on the booking form. I was directed to 'George, Manager' this was a waste of time, I showed him my paperwork requesting 3 beds he as much as said us Europeans were too fussy. I was getting nowhere with him, I pointed out that I paid extra for a view and now it seems we will get a brick wall view because I want real beds in the room!I was too tired to put my points across anymore and walked away, he was condescending and I was not up for it.So thats what we got beds to suit adults with a brick wall view, no coffee making facilities which were in the other room and paid extra for it !Good points - maid service daily if you want it.Bathroom, a little old and tired, door of which was grubby maybe a lick of paint or just a simple wash down.Location - great"
93,1889,Jul 18 2009 	Hotel or Booth camp?	On arrival at this hotel I was met by an obnoxious man at check in. The location is good that's about it. There are far better hotels in New york for the price. Stay away is my advice.
94,1889,"Jul 17 2009 	Good Hotel in a great location	We arrived at the hotel and get checked in hassle free. We were a little disappointed with the view from our room as we had requested at the time of the booking a room with a view but the only view we had was the hotel walls. The room size was fine for us and the bathroom was standard. The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels provided. The rooms have heating/AC which worked perfect for us. There have been a lot of comments about the elevators which were didnt think were a problem at all, half the battle is understanding how they work which isn't rocket science! The staff were friendly enough as we had asked for help on the subway and one particular guy was more than happy to help. We never ate at the hotel as it appeared a little overpriced but that seems to be the same with all hotels. Location is brilliant, a 5 minute walk from the very busy times square and a 10 minute walk from central park. The subway is also located right outside the hotel. Lots of delis and other places to eat on your doorstep so very handy. Overall, i would certainly recommend this hotel and we were very pleased with our stay!"
95,1889,"Jul 15 2009 	Very Nice Stay	We are a family of 3 adults and we were all very pleased with our room at the Park Central. I mentioned to the staff during check-in that I was travelling with my father. They assigned to us the perfect room for a family of adults. Our room had two beds, with a closet separating each side of the room. Each bed was separated from the other by the closet in the middle. It served as two independent areas offering privacy for our family. We were very comfortable. We had a window overlooking Seventh Avenue. I was happy to have a pleasant view out of our window. There was a large flat-screen TV in the middle of the room that was viewable from both beds on each side of the room. The hotel lobby is very nice, with a modern decor. AND THE PICTURES OF NEW YORK ALL OVER THE HOTEL ARE FANTASTIC. There are beautiful artsy black and white pictures throughout the hallways and the elevators. I loved walking around and staring at each photo.The location of this hotel can't be beat. Central Park is a short three-blocks away out the door. In the opposite direction is Times Square just a short walk down Seventh Avenue. Rockefeller Center and Radio City are also a few blocks away. Subway stations with different lines are conveniently near.We only found one fault with our room, which could easily be remedied by the Housekeeping department with a cup of bleach. Note to Hotel Manager, please have the mold around the bathtub cleaned up. The bathrooms were clean, but it is unacceptable to allow mold to fester without bleaching it out and maybe applying a dab of caulking. There is no mini-bar in the room, and there is no coffe maker for those of us who need to wake up with a Cup-o-Joe. But this was a minor inconvenience when there were so many other positive features that made our stay enjoyable.The hotel charges extremely high rates for Internet access. I went downstairs to Starbucks to get online and saved $14/day. I strongly believe that hotels should offer this service to its guests. Charging for online access is a way to gouge money out of guests. There's free Internet access all over New York.We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant because the menu prices were steep and the restaurant was always empty, which is a sure red flag. I peaked at the breakfast buffet and it looked like nothing to brag about. The price is $25 per person for breakfast. We passed. There are plenty of places to eat a good breakfast for much less (across the street is a great breakfast restaurant, and also Fluffy's also across the street on the next block was fantastic and affordable. WATCH OUT FOR CARNEGIE DELI...We wanted to eat at Carnegie Deli, for the sake of tradition. Well, all I'm going to say is that it was not a smart way to spend our food budget. Ridiculous huge amounts of cold cuts on white sliced bread that no human being could possibly open up wide enough to bite into. The sandwiches are a monstruosity. You end up eating cold cuts with a fork. Boring! The price? $95 for 2 sandwiches, a Greek salad, a matzo ball soup and a couple of fountain sodas (no free refills). We fell into the Carnegie Deli tourist trap. We found Fluffy's across the street and made it our New York hangout. They serve great sanwiches and desserts at the right price.We love New York. Everything about New York is exciting to me. The food is always fresh, the neighborhoods are vibrant, and I just feel good walking around. God Bless the Big Apple!I would be happy to stay at the Park Central Hotel again. It would be even better if they take care of the moldy bathtub and are a bit more generous with their Internet policy."
96,1889,"Jul 13 2009 	Location Great Rooms Are TINY!	Typical 3 star hotel, nothing special. Great location though! The rooms are tiny, two doubles :( The ice machine/vending were not working on three floors we tried. Cheap for new york though. The worst place I stayed in NYC, try the Affinia Manhattan or Embassy Suites, same prices but MUCH better!"
97,1889,"Jul 9 2009 	Great Place to Stay	This was my first time in NYC and was not sure on which hotel to stay at. I am glad I chose this one. Hotel is located about 3 blocks from Central Park, Right next to the subway out the back door, very close to 5th Ave for shopping and Time Square is close enough to walk to.Rooms were your basic and housekeeping had are room cleaned by 11:00 every day.Staff were all very friendly and helpful. We got into NYC around 12:00 and we were able to check in and get a room early.I recommend staying here and would stay again."
98,1889,"Jul 8 2009 	Fantastic Location	My wife and i have only just recently returned from a week staying here and it was a great hotel,clean,comfortable and as for the loaction well it couldnt be any finer.Everything about our stay was great. I just dont know why some people bother to go on holiday if all they have to do is moanIf i were to have a little moan then it would be to say that when we booked through an external agency, they gave us an &quot;all -included&quot; price and said that we would need to pay no tax, only the price showed on the booking.When we checked out, the hotel had charged us an extra $200 which we were not happy about..maybe someone from management could have a look at this for me?"
99,1889,"Jul 7 2009 	My go to mid-town hotel when traveling on my own nickel.	I have stayed here many times over the last several years. While many hotels are nicer, I haven't found a better hotel for the money when traveling on my own nickel. This is a 3 star hotel, comparable to a Sheraton or Hilton in all but rate. I don't bother searching for low rates in New York and just book the Park Central. The service is friendlier too. Room size is similar to slightly larger than comparable newer hotels and larger than the older hotels. It is an easy walk to all but the farthest mid-town locations and its 7th Avenue location makes for easy cab rides. I drive down from Boston and this location is an easy short drive off and then back on the West Side Highway. The only downside is most nearby restaurants are overpriced tourist joints with lousy food. Try the Brooklyn Diner on 57th between 7th and Broadway instead."
100,1889,"Jul 7 2009 	If you're willing to overlook some minor details the Park Central is a fantastic place to stay while you're in NYC.	(Date of stay - June 29-July 4) Having read the hotel reviews before I got there, I was expecting the worst. This hotel seemed like the best deal out of all the other packages that I looked at on Expedia, and the location was the best for our needs as well. It is close (5-10min walk) to TImes Square AND Central Park, it's right by the theatre district, there's a subway stop right beside the hotel, there are restaurants galore within a 2 minute walk, it was perfect for us. As soon as we got there, we did notice that the scaffolding on the outside was still there but it really didn't obstruct our view of the hotel and if anything, it was nice because it provided some cover from the rain while we were there. The lobby is bright, air-conditioned, and clean and no matter what time of day we came and went it was never crowded. We arrived just after 4pm, and there were a few people ahead of us checking in but we didn't wait more than a minute or two before they opened up another desk to help us. I had booked a Superior room with a King size bed through Expedia because the room with the double beds was going to be an extra $150. I asked if they had any rooms with double beds available and was upgraded at no extra cost, with no hassles. Everyone greeted me by name, and they were extremely friendly and helpful.Now, the elevators, they are a major pain in the butt until you figure out how to work them. There are two bays of elevators at opposite ends of the lobby, one serves the lower floors and the other is for the higher floors. You have to select your floor from the touchpad at ground level, and the computer will dispatch an elevator to you. HOWEVER, that elevator is not necessarily going to be the fastest one. You CANNOT hop into the next available elevator and press the buttons from inside because it will NOT work. You MUST summon the elevator using the touchpad. It is annoying and very slow, but it's better than taking the stairs (which you can't even do because the door is locked at ground level). The room itself was beautiful. Standard size for hotel rooms, and quite large for your typical NY hotel room. We had a large flat screen tv in the room with HD cable. There were no large bath towels in our room when we arrived, but someone came by to check to see how we settled in and they sent up some towels for us immediately. The AC in our room only had one temperature setting - COLD. We turned it off before going to dinner so it was pleasant by the time we went to bed. Not a big deal, it's better than no AC at all. The beds were comfortable, rooms were kept VERY clean. There was always hot water no matter what time of day we showered, which was nice. The drain in the tub was a little sluggish. The water was definitely hottest in the mornings though.The blackout curtains in the room were great to keep out the morning sun for the days when we wanted to sleep in. The room was also amazingly quiet for being on the 4th floor. We didn't have a great view (we could see Hooters and the parking lot next door, that's about it) but who wants to sit in their room and stare out their window all day? We used our in-room safe for our valuables, it is available free of charge. They also have more safes down at the front desk. The safe did get stuck once, inexplicably, and security was a little slow getting back to us but they had it fixed in no time. They were very friendly and apologetic.INTERNET, well, that was a royal pain. It is very expensive ($14.04/day). You can choose between LAN or wireless internet, neither of which are very fast or reliable. I wouldn't recommend paying for the internet, trust me, it's not worth it. You'll spend half your time hitting refresh, and the other half the time screaming at your laptop. There is a business centre available if you need to print or fax anything, but internet there is $0.30/minute with a minimum charge of $5, and printing/copying/faxing is $1/sheet. Not worth it!I didn't use the gym but my brother did, he said it wasn't half bad for a hotel gym, had a few treadmills, elliptical, weight machine, bike, etc. Lastly, our package was supposed to include the buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. I believe it was called the Park Cafe? It is right in the lobby. Not very big, so would be very slow at peak times but it opens at 6:30am and goes until 11. We only ate there once, but the food was quite good. Service is slowwww but it was free, so whatever! They did charge the meal to our room ($61!) but when I checked out they reversed the charges for us with a smile and a big apology. Speaking of check-out, in order to speed up the process, they slip a copy of your invoice under your door the morning of your check-out and if everything is in order, you can actually check out using your television. In the menu there is a guest-services link and if you follow the prompts not only can you check on the status of your account throughout your stay, you can quickly and efficiently check out from the comfort of your own room.All in all, the positives outweighed the little negatives and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while visiting NYC. Make sure you visit the Carnegie Deli right next door for the best deli sandwiches and cheesecake in the world! Just don't go at peak hours or you'll be waiting in a line that goes all the way down 7th Ave. It's open from 6:30am-4am daily."
101,1889,"Jul 5 2009 	Very good location	An ideal hotel for the family or group booking with friends. No frills but good sized rooms. Located in a central location ideal for Parks,Midtown and the West side. Great staff,very good Theatre booking service,1st rate and better than some of the more high end hotels.Only minor downpoint would be the lift,takes ages! so do as we did and go find the stairs,the higher your floor the better your workout!"
102,1889,"Jul 5 2009 	My birthday and America's too!	We arrived early and were able to check in at 1:00! (I called ahead) We wanted to make the most of our stay so right after checking in we headed out to explore the city. The location is great! The subway is right next to the hotel, Times Square is a few blocks away and so is Central Park! We purchased the New York City Pass for 2 days and made it to so many sites using the Greyline Sight Seeing buses. I would definitely recommend planning out your sights then hopping on and off the bus to explore as many as you can! The bus has tour guides that tell you all about the history of the bldgs, parks, attractions, etc. It rained on and off on our trip but thanks to the free rain ponchos we stayed up top and weathered the rain drops to enjoy the tour. The parking was expensive since we didn't need the car, maybe next time we'll park it off site a few blocks for a cheaper rate or take the train."
103,1889,"Jul 1 2009 	Nice Hotel. Great value for Manhattan	It's a nice hotel. The rooms are clean, and the service is very good. It was significantly cheaper than some of the more expensive ones in the city. I thought it was a great value."
104,1889,"Jun 28 2009 	Great Location and Great Rates	On the corner with a yellow subway line and a Starbucks! What more could you ask for? Its within easy walking distance of Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall... just to name a few. Room rates were good and there were just a few minor issues such as our keys quit working late one night for no reason and there is a charge for the internet which says you pay for 24 hours at a time... but you don't. I paid for many days thinking the trip was covered, but on the last day, I had to buy another day at 4pm.. which should have been good for 24 hours. It wasn't... the next morning, it wanted me to buy another day. But minor stuff. Overall... a great location and a great price."
105,1889,"Jun 28 2009 	Great location	Together with friends we were for one full week in the Park Central hotel in NY. The room was fine, the staff throughout the hotel was always polite but not effective when a problem arises... at check-in we had to wait for two hours at five in the afternoon because the room was not ready. Also by mid week we had to change the room because the door lock was not working. Location was proximate to a lot of great theaters and restaurants and very easy to get around town."
106,1889,"Jun 25 2009 	Park Central-excellent service and room	We stayed at the Park Central in June 2009 for four nights, and I have no complaints. Check in time is 4:00 p.m., but we got there about 3 hours early, and were able to check in right away. Our room was on the 24th floor, and was very clean, and quite large for a NYC hotel room. I can't say enough about how clean the room was, the bathroom was clean, no mold or mildew. Our room had a large bathroom, king sized bed, a large closet, large flat screen tv and plenty of room to walk around. From checking in to checking out the staff were excellent. My husband lost money in a soda vending machine, and they promptly reimbursed his money. We did not use the concierge because we are familiar with NYC, but during the day it looked like they always had two people at the desk to help people. The hotel is close to two subway stops, one is one block up, and Central Park is four blocks away, Times Square is about 12 blocks away. I would recommend this hotel."
107,1889,"Jun 23 2009 	Mid Town Find	Reasonable rates, clean, great sheets, centrally located, but out of the fray."
108,1889,"Jun 20 2009 	Great location and great service!	We stayed for four days, three nights and found all the staff cheerful as well as helpful.The room was clean but as reported before the bathrooms have no ventilation."
109,1889,"Jun 18 2009 	Fabulous Place to Stay	Four of us spent six nights at Park Central. The staff was friendly, helpful, and their sense of humor was great. This hotel is the perfect place to stay in New York. It's easy to walk to Time Square and Central Park. Subway stations are on the corner. Broadway is just a few blocks away. The only draw back of the hotel was the elevators. They were slow when the hotel was busy. However, if you stay on the 3rd or 4th floor the stairs are not bad. Also, look for the service elevators. The staff will help you use them when the regular elevators are busy. If I go back to New York City, I will definitely stay at Park Central Hotel."
110,1889,"Jun 15 2009 	Awesome location close to Broadway Times Square and Central Park	My partner and I were recommended this Hotel by a friend who had recently stayed there, we were told it was 3.5 star and a great location which were very true. When we arrived we discovered the hotel was undergoing renovations and was covered in scaffolding over the exterior which was a little off putting but none-the-less wasn't inconvenient to us. We booked online and chose from memory a superior room with king size bed but on arrival were offered a room with 2 double beds, we had to complain and were upgraded to what we had ordered although the reception staff seemed quite bothered by our complaint. Our superior room was recently renovated and clean, we had a very comfortable bed with fresh, crisp linen. We had a nice meal at the Hotel Restaurant one night. The Hotel had a tourist information/booking desk and there was a fabulous lady there I think called Maureen who had incredible knowledge of the sights to see including some little gems that weren't so famous. The hotel was also conveniently located with a subway entrance on the corner of the hotel. Our stay here was comfortable and as noted close to Broadway, Times Square and Central Park."
111,1889,"Jun 9 2009 	%.	Booked online through their website and was able to book at 30% less than our travel agent. The person checkfing us in went to great lengths to get us an outside room (one with windows)and had no problem checking us in even though we were 2 hours early . The room was larger than expected and seemed pretty clean. The only thing I noticed as strange was the windows in the shower/tub, but they were completely frosted for privacy so no complaint there. All the staff we encountered were polite and helpful. Did think that $14.95/day for internet access was a little extreme, and after seeing the room service prices decided to make the effort to find meals elsewhere. But overall a very pleasant experience. Would definately stay there again. The location was close to all our points of interest, and the subway stop is just outside the hotel."
112,1889,"Jun 2 2009 	Excellent Location Comfortable Rooms	The location was excellent! Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Theater District, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building. Plenty of decent restaurants very close to the hotel, Ben Ash Deli across the street was very good although a little spendy. There is also a Starbucks right next door for those who can't go without their morning coffee!The room was much bigger than we expected to see in NYC. The room itself could have used some updating but was very comfortable overall with a large bathroom. All the hotel staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Check-in and out took only a few mins each and the people at the concierge desk were wonderful as we purchased tickets to a few different events from them.Only complaint was the broken safe in our room. We called front desk about it and they sent someone up within minutes. He said it could not be fixed but we could get a different room with a working safe or use the safes they have downstairs. Not wanting to give up our room with a view of Times Square, we chose the second option.We had an excellent stay at the Park Central and would stay again when returning to New York!"
113,1889,"Jun 1 2009 	Manky	I found the service efficient and fine, but the room was pretty manky. The furniture was pretty beat up and the carpet, although vacuumed, seemed pretty dirty. The bathroom's shower curtain was moldy and there was shower gel or something stuck on to it. The biggest problem is the lack of ventilation. There are no controls for air circulation, not even an air vent for the bathroom, which is desperately needed. The location is good, but the moldy shower curtain was a huge turn-off to say the least."
114,1889,"May 29 2009 	Unfriendly and unhelpful staff - bad service but good location	Apologies for this lengthy review but we were completely fed up by Park Central. Please read on before you make any booking with this hotel.Their service is definitely a huge disappointment - right from the moment we booked the hotel room. We booked through their on-line system for non-refundable special rate. The booking went through but they claimed that AMEX payment was declined so they cancelled the booking without first checking with us, and then asked us to give them our credit card details within 48 hours to reinstate the booking. I would have thought any decent hotel would have the courtesy to check with their customers before cancelling the booking? Anyway, we went ahead because it was getting close to the time of our trip and we couldn't be bothered to check out other hotels. The room is a bit old and run down, water pressure from the shower was quite low, but given the special rate we got (USD 162 tax inclusive), we can live with that. High speed internet in room, but at a charge of USD14.99 per day. Storage of luggage at USD 3.75 per piece per day - even for same day pick-up within 2 hours! We stayed in the hotel for one night, left for Canada for 5 days and then return to the hotel - that costs us USD18.75 already! Expensive - but we accepted that's NYC. While we appreciate hotel is after all a money making business, we were truly annoyed when the hotel staff made money by deceit. When we asked for directions to Newark Airport, the front desk staff told us that we can't take yellow cab as the airport is in New Jersey. He said that we MUST book a car to the airport and he can arrange for that. The car hire costs USD$85. We later found out from yellow cab driver that yellow cab can take us there at flat rate of USD65 plus toll of USD8! I can accept that car hire through hotel will be more expensive, but to lie about yellow cab not allowed to go to Newark Airport is absolutely not acceptable. The hotel staff has no integrity and is simply ripping tourists off! As if that's not enough, when we returned from Canada we asked for late check out at 12:30 (normal check out time is 12:00, so we were only asking for 30 mins extension), we were bluntly turned down. Just another 15 mins? &quot;Absolutely NO, our hotel is FULLY booked!&quot; So much for their quality service they claim they are offering their guests. Then we asked how much is the approximate charge of yellow cab to JFK terminal, the front desk staff told us that we need to book a car and it would cost USD85. When we returned to our room and checked on the internet, we found out that yellow cab charges a flat rate of USD 45 plus toll of USD5. We tried to call the front desk from our room to cancel the booking. Neither the operator nor the conceirge picked up the phone, it took us 45 minutes to finally get through to the front desk. The lady said their concierge closes at night and therefore no one would pick up! I told her that we want to cancel our car booking, she said she couldn't do that because the bell man would call the driver direct to place the booking. She would need to track down the bell man to cancel the booking. She asked me whether I know the name if the bell man - I told her that we place the booking with front desk not the bell man, how would I know his name???? I ask her to put one of the bell men on the phone so that I can leave a message for the cancellation and she again said she can't as there is only 1 bell man on duty at night. uhhhh???? If there is only 1 bell man on duty - how difficult would that be to track down the bell man who placed the order in less than an hour ago? This is just incredibly illogical?!!!!! Anyway, I told her to leave a message to the bell man to cancel the booking. When we left the hotel the next day and tried to get a yellow cab, a bell man asked us where we are going and we told him JFK. He asked whether we have booked a car, we said we did but we had cancelled the booking the night before. He said the car had arrived and he offered to cut the price from USD85 to USD 55 right away ( I guess the $30 is how much he or the hotel made out of our booking!) I insisted on taking yellow cab and the bell man started to yell at the cab driver for taking away his business, and then came the bodily contact! Another incredible demonstration of their service - bell man picking a fight with cab driver right in the face of a hotel guest!!!! Several other cab drivers stopped by to offer support to my cab driver. The bell man continued to yell and scream as our cab pulled away from the hotel.Our stay in the hotel was a terrible experience - worst that I ever had! We have black-listed this hotel and will never go back again. Recommend a friend to stay there? NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!I do hope that the hotel management would pick up this review and respond. I wonder what explanation they can give..."
115,1889,"May 27 2009 	A great base of operations!	Located just a few blocks from the heart of Time Square this hotel is reasonably priced for the area at $159 a night. We were pleased to find that we were right in the middle of the action, just a few blocks from Broadway, and there is a NY sight seeing bus stop right outside the door. The concierge desk was okay, not great. The rooms are plain approaching bare bones, but if you are looking for somewhere that is clean, affordable, and spacious enough that you can stretch out a bit, then look no further. The hotel was undergoing some serious renovations while we were there, so it may be getting a major face lift. We were happy with our stay and would return if we could get the room for the same price."
116,1889,"May 26 2009 	I can't believe this room had so many disappointments.	As soon as we entered our room, we found it hot and humid like the 85 degree temperature outside. Maintenance said the air conditioning could not be fixed and they brought a fan to our room (which blew the hot, sticky air around.) The water in the shower stall did not go down the drain, so you were standing ankle-deep in filthy water. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work. Our window view was a brick wall which we wouldn't have minded if everything else were satisfactory. Water leaked from around the base of the toilet everytime it was flushed. The hair blow dryer had the power of less-than-low and was excessively loud. The staff was friendly, but the room was so below acceptable, we would never stay there again."
117,1889,May 26 2009 	Excellent base to explore midtown	I have stayed in multiple hotels in New York and was very impressed by both the quality and location on the Park Central. It is about a 10/15 minute walk to Time Square and a 10 minute walk to Central Park. Although the rooms are nothing extraordinary they were clean and functional and a perfect base to explore the city. The bar was a little pricey (even for New York!). There was a Starbucks next door and multiple diners on the same block. It is a great base for a touristy trip to New York but a little too central if you want to explore the more unusual parts of the city.
118,1889,"May 23 2009 	Clean functional central friendly with no frills.	The Park Central is an ideal base to push out and explore NYC, the hotel doesn't have many bells and whistles, but it isn't meant to. It's great value and located right in the heart of the action.The staff are as friendly as New Yorkers tend to be, the rooms are clean, reasonably spacious and functional. The check in is efficient and hassle free, the doormen are helpful, knowledgeable and will grab you a cab for a small tip.From the hotel you are a few blocks away from 5th Avenue, Columbus Circle, Central Park, Times Square, Hells Kitchen, Subways, the Port Authority, Restaurants and Shops Galore. All within easy walking distance.My advice is if you are going to NYC to hit the shops, bars,restaurants, theatres and attractions, and are considering the Park Central, go for it. It is a place to lay your head and you can spend your money elsewhere."
119,1889,"May 22 2009 	Great location rooms not too bad	Let me start by saying not a lot of time was spent in the hotel, the location itself was a great base for touring the city. Youre within walking distance of Central Park, Broadway, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center. There is a subway station outside the side door of the hotel and there is also another one just up 7th avenue. The room was spacious, especially for a NYC hotel, the beds were comfy and we had a brand new flat screen TV. The bathroom was quite big as well, no problems here, the showers were warm and the shower head was powerful. The lobby was going under a renovation, but it didnt really affect us too much. What I didnt like was being on the third floor, there was three night clubs directly across from us and at 4:00 am I want to go to sleep and not be disturbed by drunken people. Other than that I had no complaints. There is Starbucks right outside the front door, Carnegie Deli is a mere 30 steps away and is fantabulous. We closed out every night at a bar called Names and Faces, its at 54th and 7th. Great bartenders, good bard food and not too bad prices. I would stay here again; I would just request to be on a higher floor."
120,1889,"May 20 2009 	I'd stay again at this hotel.	I went with my husband recently to NYC. He for business, mine leisure. We stayed at 2 different hotels. Park Central was the first. We liked this hotel. The location was great, the room was always clean and updated, bathroom very roomy. Coffee pot in room and ice down the hall. Our breakfast was included at a very reasonable price for a big city. The second hotel we stayed at charged $28.00 each for breakfast. Staff was VERY helpful and pleasant. We walked everywhere from this location. Would stay again."
121,1889,"May 20 2009 	Good Location	Lobby was somewhat confusing, My room was on the 12th floor and there were no signs directing me where to go. Overall, comfy and clean but the elevator was quite a walk away from our room."
122,1889,"May 20 2009 	good price good location good hotel great weekend	Since I havent been to NYC for 15 years and my wife has never been there at all, wanted to make sure we were in a central location to be able to walk to most sights and areas, and the Park Central is perfectly situated with that in mind (stayed for a long weekend). The hotel is a huge beast but it's got everything you'd need to make a stay worthwhile...we had a clean quiet room with a comfy bed and a bathtub to soak away the foot aches after walking for 8 hours a day. It was easy to check in and out, and the in-house concierges (there's several of them) were patient and provided helpful suggestions without any attitude. Buy some bagels and have breakfast in central park (2 minute walk) to start your day and have a great time!!! The price was fantastic (through Expedia-got 300$ savings booking flight and hotel together) and the Park Central was a perfect place to crash after our adventures."
123,1889,"May 19 2009 	Please do not waste your money on this hotel	Good location, pity that is such a terrible hotel. From the moment we checked in we could not wait to check out! Staff are unfriendly, food is terrible, rooms are small and very dated and dark. PLEASE DO NOT RESERVE HERE. I used to live in New York and it was close to where i worked and always thought it looked really nice I made the mistake of booking it as it looks good on the outside but thats where it ends."
124,1889,"May 14 2009 	Nice hotel great service	I stayed here on a business trip for work. The staff was helpful, I had a nice room, it was on the small side and the view was horrible, but everything was very clean. It was not loud and I had no problems staying here."
125,1889,"May 13 2009 	Great location nice hotel not so good service.	We stayed one week at this hotel and we liked it. The location is just perfect, very close to Times Square, Broadway, Columbus Circle, etc, and 2 blocks from Central Park.The room was very nice, very comfortable and with a lot of space, nice bathroom and was always very clean. The TV was very nice too.Now the only problems we had: our room heater was not working properly and even after I warned them twice about it, nobody did anything to fix it and not even sent me a message explaining why. Also the restaurant staff (same as breakfast) is very unprepared and unprofessional, they are not polite and the price there is too high. We always had breakfast elsewhere.Bottom line is: the price of this hotel was great for its location and its accommodations, but don't go expecting a class A service."
126,1889,"May 10 2009 	loved it !	Second time we have stayed in NYC. This is the best hotel! Location is excellent- 10 mins walk from time square, 30 seconds from the South end of Central Park. Room was lovely and bathroom lovely. Coffee machine in bathroom, ice in the corridor, huge wide screen TV.We were at the back of the hotel so it was amazingly quiet, until they started building works on the hotel next door at 7am every morning. We were offered a room change but couldn't be bothered with 2 days left. They gave us free luggage storage after checkout on the last day as compensation. (Otherwise there is a charge for this service). I would definatelty recommend staying on the top floor- 25th I think as it eliminates street noise.Staff are very polite and the room was well cleaned every day.Hotel restaurant was really expensive- we didn't bother eating there, it was empty most of the time.There is a street nearby which has wonderful Japenese and Chinese food- hidden away a bit and patronised by locals. We ate there a lot as it is so much better value. Buy drinks from Duane Reed rather than the cafes- saves loads of money and there is free ice in the hotel. We got the train from the airport as it is much cheaper and we didn't have lots of luggage, it was about $9 each in total. Taxis aren't too expensive at $45 from aiport to hotel. The bus is useless, takes ages and is expensive considering. we did it last time- never again.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we return to NYC if the prices have not gone up. I think we paid 450 for flights and 5 nights inclusive."
127,1889,"May 4 2009 	We will go back we liked this Hotel	We spent 5 nights in mid March, this Hotel is very good, no complain, everything clean, the room perfect, the bath okay, the elevators very well organized, in my opinion, to be more efficient, the people must be more patient and take the one that was assigned by the computerized system.For a tourist who loves New York, the location is excellent, the sightseeing buses stop at 100 yards, the subway is around the corner, Central Park is at two blocks, plenty of Delis and restaurants to dinner at walking distance.We had only problem, we were at low season, the Hotel was half empty; we paid for a concierge room at the 22nd floor with the promise of a view to Times square, and got a view of a wall of bricks and windows, great disappointment.A friend, who paid less, for a 5th floor superior king room, had a view on 6th Avenue. Apart of that we are very happy with the choice and the value. Of course, I will recommend this Hotel to all my friends."
128,1889,May 4 2009 	Excelent location - large rooms	The Hotel has an excelent location on the 7th avenue and just 500 mts from the cosmopolitan times square and in the front of the Carnegie Hall.the room was very large with 2 king beds (we were only a couple on the room)big plasma tv.cleaned every day.the decoration is a bit old fashioned.The location is perfect!
129,1889,"May 1 2009 	From someone who's lived in NYC...	I lived in NYC for 7 years prior to our visit April 2009. We got a really good rate on the hotel so I was expecting a pretty small, somewhat dingy hotel (as we had stayed at a 1/2 star lower hotel a year ago and it was small and dingy). It actually turned out to be a very nice hotel w/a beautiful lobby, okay excercise room and very clean rooms. The photos make the rooms look old, but actually it's more modern looking in real life. The room was not super big, but there was a king size bed, 2 chairs, a desk and flat screen tv and we didn't feel overcrowded... plus, this is NY and if you've ever seen most people's apartments in NY, you wouldn't think this was that small. The location is great, I used to work a block away and this is centrally located. W/in blocks are Central Park south, Carnegie Hall, the Time Warner building, Times Square, 5th Ave shopping. 2 downsides: no in room fridge, it's $25 to rent a crib, they charge by the hour to hold your bags.Carnegie Deli is right next door, famous for it's delicous, huge deli sandwiches. Yes, the sandwiches are $15, but the portions are huge. Btw, we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and ate at Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the best pizza you can get. Totally worth the trip to Brooklyn.Instead of spending $40 from JFK to the city ($70 from the city to JFK, yes it's higher going to the airport), I would recommend taking the AirTran from Penn Station. It's easy and so much cheaper. Good luck and have fun!"
130,1889,"Apr 30 2009 	What do people expect/	Having kept an eye on the reviews on this site over the past few month, i arrived at Park Central on 23 April wondering quite what to expect. What i actually got was: a very clean, spacious room; friendly and helpful service and a great, great location. I really don't know what people expect these days; this hotel is hardly the most expensive and, in my opinion, was well worth the money. The fact that you can be in Central park within two minutes from leaving the front door is good enough for me."
131,1889,"Apr 29 2009 	Average service and decor in this fantastic location	The Park Central's service was mixed. The staff in the restaurant and the concierge were exceptionally friendly but the reception staff were mixed. My friend had her credit card stolen from the reception area and when we told reception (for the sole reason that they could be alert and tell other customers to be aware) they didn't seem to care.Our room was very clean and tidy, although unfortunately it was a strange shape. Very long and squashed in comparison to our friends' rooms. This wasn't a problem as we were barely there. The location was fabulous. Two or three blocks from Central Park and a few blocks away from Times Square. As a result there were plenty of bars and restaurants, liquor stores and grocery places open to the early hours. We did not like the fact that we had to pay for our bags to be stored for us - both prior to check-in (we arrived at the hotel at 12pm and their check-in wasn't till 4pm) and when we checked out. No other hotel (and we stayed at five during our trip) charged for this service."
132,1889,Apr 28 2009 	Great position excellent value for money	Always stay at this hotel since discovering it 10 years ago. Great position for both shopping and site seeing. Good sized clean and comfortable rooms.
133,1889,"Apr 25 2009 	Held Hostage - No Air	No Kidding! We were on a family vacay and late May was a little warm. No in room controls and management refused to turn on main control. We were told to prop open the window which only allowed 6 inches of air in the room. Tension was building...staff were rude and even looked mad when you approached - kind of like prison gaurds. After one night stay, we did something bold...we checked out - first time in our lives we ever did that. As we looked back at the curtains blowing from the windows they appeared to be almost waving at us. We were the lucky ones, because as we drove further down away from the hotel, you could see small electric fans in some windows. Unbelievable!"
134,1889,"Apr 24 2009 	Excellent stay in a good value for money hotel	This is a fine hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the lifts were slow, but the hotel has done the best they can. You know the lifts are slow, so plan ahead!One dollar a day for the chambermaid works wonders in having your room cleaned when you want and getting extra towels etc. The rooms were a good size and contained all the usual things. Bathrooms clean and spacious with ample hot water.Location was excellent and there are many cafes etc nearby. Can thoroughly recommend Petrossian (182 W57th) for beakfast and fabbo coffee."
135,1889,Apr 23 2009 	Decent enough hotel	Nothing spectacular about this hotel. The location is a little far from mid-town so you may want to avoid if you prefer to be closer to Time Square.It is good value though if you get the right price as the rooms are decent and the hotel is clean.
136,1889,"Apr 17 2009 	Park Central - would stay there again!	Me and my partner stayed there 3 days at the end of March. Everything was great. We were on the 15th floor, we saw times square lights from our window. We had a corner room, so there were 3 windows in our room. Bathroom was clean and also the room. Breakfast was also ok, staff was friendly. Location is very good, central park is two block from the hotel."
137,1889,"Apr 13 2009 	Brilliant location everything else is a bonus	I stopped at this hotel for 5 days mid march. I was staying her with my mum and although I had booked a king size room when we checked in we asked for 2 queens instead and they made this happen without any fuss. We stayed in room 505 which is on the 5th floor, it had a good view of 7th Avenue with Carnegie Hall just to the left of the hotel and times square a short walk to the right. We had a bit of trouble operating the safe but we rang reception about this and within minutes a very nice and helpful secruity gaurd arrived at sorted us out. The room was a brilliant size. The beds were a nice size and comfotable. There was a nice size closet with the safe (which you dont have to pay to use like some hotels in Europe). The bathroom was also a good size. The room was extremely clean and I have high standards. We had no problem with the lifts never waited more than a few minutes which i think is more than understandable for a hotel with 20 odd floors. All the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. We spoke to a few of the housekeeping staff who were friendly and liked chatting to us.The hotel is in the best location possible. Most tourist destinations are either a short walk or a subway ride away. There are subway stations located close to the hotel depending on where you want to go. Times Square is about 10 minutes slow walk right out of the hotel. Broadway is behind the hotel. Fifth Avenue is just a 10-15 min walk. As is Rockerfeller Centre which by the way is a big must. Get the sunrise and sunset ticket for just $10 more than a normal day ticket it is well worth it. You get the most amazing views of manhattan. And you have two days to use the sunset ticket. It was the best thing we did. We heard from other tourists that the view from Rockerfeller is better than Empire state and much less busy. There are so many places to eat around the hotel although the closer you are to Times Square the more expensive it is.Apparently there are some great places to eat along 9th Avenue although we didnt eat there. We found a great deli to the left of the hotel (opposite Carnegie Hall) on the last day. It was much cheaper and had better produce than the ones further right of the hotel.We were very impressed with the hotel and would definatly stay there again and recommend it to anyone going there. If anyone wants any tips or has any questions about the hotel feel free to ask."
138,1889,Apr 13 2009 	Good location but the rooms are not kept up.	I recently stayed at Park Central with my son's band group that was performing at Carnegie. The location of the hotel to everything was excellent but the rooms are not kept up. Lobby we very nice however I wish they paid as much attention to the rooms as well. Maybe there isn't enough help to really clean the room but I had a large crack on the ceiling over my bed and mildew in the bathroom. Several of our light bulbs were burnt out but maintenance replaced them after we asked. My sheets were old with torn areas on them. Pretty gross they don't replace old sheets. I don't think for the whole week we were there that they changed our bedding.
139,1889,"Apr 13 2009 	Worst hotel I've ever booked	I had to change my room 3 times because of how small and unclean they were. The 3rd room they gave me was the best of the worst. It was tiny, dirty and had 3 locks and a chain on the door which didnt make me feel too safe. The icing on the cake, was finding a dead cockroach belly up on the rug--which I didn't walk bare foot on for fear of what was on it. The only positive was that the hotel is in a very convenient location; however, there are plenty of better hotels in the area that are clean and worth the extra few dollars."
140,1889,"Apr 7 2009 	I really liked this hotel	My only downside...was...about me personally and not about the hotel. I have stayed in midtown so much...I really like being away from the touristy stuff at this point. But, the price was right and the hotel ser vices were great and in the end...there are ways to avoid the tourist and have a great time! Plus there is a subway line just outside the door of this hotel....and it proves to be convenient...if you want or need it! The room was clean, the mattresses...may need to be replaced...but not at the point that i found too uncomfortable. The noise from the street was present...but it is a city...and this should be expected. Check in and out was great...and overall friendly service all around."
141,1889,"Apr 7 2009 	Top class	I was a bit nervous about our stay at this hotel from reading some of the reviews, but I can honestly say that we had a great stay with absolutely no problems, during the last week of March. When I booked the room back in November, the total cost for my wife and I, including taxes was just over $2000.00 for a 6 night stay in a 19th floor concierge suite, including buffet breakfast. I found out that if you go back to the internet site and find the price lower, you can book again, and just cancel the original booking. I went back to the site a few times and re-booked twice, in the end getting the 6 night stay, with breakfast, for $1224.00 for myself and my wife. I put in the 'comments' box, that I wished to cancel the previous booking ref and to take this one instead. I also checked by email to confirm that they had the cheaper booking. That was the price we paid on check-out, which is excellent for Manhattan for 2 adults, including an 'all you can eat' breakfast!. It is in an excellent location for Times Square, Carnegie Hall, Broadway and Central Park and the subway couldn't be any closer. I had been pre-warned on this site about the elevators - they have an excellent system in the reception hall with a touch screen to request an elevator for your specific floor, and by the time you get round to them, there is one waiting. Usually had to wait a few minutes when coming back down, but it wasn't a problem. We didn't really have much dealings with hotel staff apart from breakfast staff who were very helpful and booking in/out, but the dealings we did have were positive. Room was very clean and towels/bed changed every day.A couple of tips about other things in the area! The Apple Store on 5th Avenue and I think about 58th street is open 24/7 and they have about 50 computers available for free internet use. Usually have to wait a minute or 2 for a laptop to become available. Also, jewelery shop on 34th street opposite Macy's called Diamonds and Dials. Bought a ring for my wife in there, but by time we got home to Scotland, one of the diamonds had fallen out - got it checked out by 2 UK jewelers who wouldn't touch it - other flaws included broken clasps and flawed gems. Contacted D&amp;D's who didn't want to know. Found out since that loads of other customers have had similar experiences.I would definately recommend this hotel to others in regards to price, cleanliness and location."
142,1889,"Apr 7 2009 	There is ZERO customer service at this hotel!	Our company had booked this hotel on a recent business trip to NYC. While we had actually stayed here once before with no problems, this next trip proved entirely different. When we checked in we let them know we'd couldn't stay the second night which we had prepaid for... the front desk clerk said no problem we won't bill you. When our credit card bill came the next month we saw they had billed us for the two nights. I called and spoke with a front desk clerk, general manager, and accounting all to no avail. They still will not give us our money back!! The general manager has been completely unwilling to compromise.You would think the Park Central wants to retain existing customers instead of driving away. The bottom line is this. Stay here at your own risk. If something goes wrong, good luck ever getting it resolved."
143,1889,"Apr 6 2009 	Wonderful location terrible service	Park Central is in a perfect location -- close to Central Park, Times Square, the Museum of Modern Art, etc. Our room was clean and spacious enough, but the service was so horrific that it definitely put a damper on our vacation. One night an alarm was going off in the next room. When we called the front desk to alert them about it, they did nothing. Finally, after the fourth call, a security officer arrived, but his attitude was nothing short of rude. A subsequent complaint to the general manager was ignored. Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel again."
144,1889,"Apr 6 2009 	Very poor customer service!	I have stayed at this hotel three times in the last 6 months. It is conveniently located and the rooms are decent especially for the price. However the management is now treating me very poorly with regards to follow up on a parking ticket that I got because of their error. I drove to NY on my last visit and a bus was parked in front of the hotel when I arrived so I had to stop in the taxi stand. I got out of my car and flagged down the doorman and told him I wanted valet parking, showed him where my car was and gave him my keys. Later on that evening I got a call from a manager informing me that I got a ticket because the doorman ending up leaving my car there too long and that the hotel would take care of the ticket. I never say the summons until I got one in the mail several weeks later. I then called the hotel and after several attempts to figure out who the right person was to speak to I was directed to security. They told me they understood and would take care of it. Well they didn't and I just got a Notice of Impending Default. They will not return my phone calls and they do not appear to want to help me despite the fact that they caused the ticket and agreed to pay it. Boycott this place!"
145,1889,"Apr 5 2009 	A pleasant surprise especially for the money.	My then boyfriend and I went to NYC to visit college friends...which was planned by him and needless to say upon arriving in NYC their space was not really going to work for 3 days of crashing at their place. I found Park Central, in what felt like the 11th hour. I ordered through hotwire and got 3 nights at 110 a night, which was a steal for a hotel in NYC, at least in my opinion. We didn't get in until about 3am, clearly very late. They had overbooked, not shocked, and we were shocked...it worked they upgraded us to as suite, for free, which was about 600 or so a night, from what the sign said in the hotel room.I heard their basic room leaves a lot to be desired, but I didn't experience it.They had higher end products in the room. We had a living room, whirlpool tub, with sitting area, plush robes, and we had a very plush bed with nice sheets. Also 2 40''+ lcd tvs in the living room and bedroom area. We also had a 22nd floor view of times square.My only qualm is the room was sort of small for all that was going on in it, and although very updated that couch was the quality of a mid-rate doctor's off lounge, at best.The concierge was nothing but nice, they were able to find us airport shuttle service at a very reasonable price, 35 to JFK in a limo, I over heard others paying 50 +Our room was clean, but not FRESH, in that it definitely had that &quot;this room was smoked in for years feel&quot;.For what we paid and what we got upgrade wise, I cannot really complain.Pros: if you can get an upgrade *always remember to ask, take it, as the other rooms i hear are quiite closet-like. service was exceptional, the lobby was very nice and they held our luggage after we checked out as our flight was a red eye that evening, can't forget LOCATION!Cons: probably room size, some stuff they cut corners on and i heard a lot of people that had traditional phone in reservations have a lot of problems."
146,1889,"Apr 5 2009 	Fun Times	We were going to New York to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with family and we got a great deal on the hotel website 40% off hotel prices. We booked our hotel stay and had a great time. I was a little concerned from other travelers about the rude staff and slow elevator, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in and check out was a breeze, no problems with our reservation and our bags were brought up to our room on the 4th floor. The room had 2 double beds and was bigger than I thought it would be. Our room was looking into the office building across the street and Hooters. We weren't that concerned with the view as we weren't planning to stay in the room....we were in NYC to celebrate! The staff was great we got great service from the maid who made sure we had extra towels, concierge and the front desk employees, even joking with us about our &quot;kiss me I'm Irish buttons&quot;. We didn't realize that the AC doesn't work during the winter and had to call someone up to help us open our window. Service was prompt and he showed us how to open it up...we thought you needed a key but we were mistaken. We ate almost everyday at Fluffy's across the street for breakfast, the food was good and not that expensive. Also had great food at West 53rd Gourmet Deli and had the best Puerto Rican food at El Deportivo on 48th street. Times Square was down the street definetly within walking distance as well as Central Park and 5th Ave. The only thing that really disappointed us with our stay was after we had checked out the doorman recommended that we take the hotel car which turned out to be a stretch limo. He told us the fee was a flat rate of $55 to take us to our in-laws in Jamaica, Queens. We agreed to the price and when we got to our destination the driver insisted that we had to pay an additional $10 for toll. We went ahead and paid the money but it did feel like we were getting the &quot;Tourist Swindle&quot;. Even though this happened I wouldn't let it take away from the great time we had in New York.. I would stay again at this hotel and would recommend it to my family and friends but I would be weary of using the hotel car."
147,1889,"Apr 3 2009 	Here's the Scoop	O.K. Here's the scoop. We stayed 5 days and 4 nights. We go to NYC once a year for business (with the whole family and colleagues). We have stayed at hotels along Time Square (always expensive..always dirty carpet). I booked our rooms online through the hotel website with the early bird special ..which included breakfast for 149.00 per night. Wow...what a deal...last year we paid 300.00 a night along Time Square. When we first arrived, they gave us a room on the fourth floor. We told the African American gentleman that we wanted double beds instead of the super king that was reserved and that we would like to check the room. We went up and the room stunk and looked well used....so we immediately went back down and told a nice young lady that it was not going to work. Then we had room 1508 which had a view of the lights on Time Square. We thought OK ..this will work. The first night my husband wanted to hook up to the internet and the in room wire connection would not work. We were afraid to do anything online with the wifi. Also, the air conditioner/heater unit did not work...and the lamp on the desk did not work....and no fans in the bathrooms. The window, however, did open...but was too noisy at night. We called the next morning to tell them of the electrical problems and that we wanted another room. She told us to check back with them at 4:00 pm to see what rooms were available. She wanted us to check our bags in at the desk but I told her that we would just leave everything by the closet door. We went down to eat breakfast and it was scrumptious!!! It made up for any problems that we may have had. An American Breakfast Buffet with Fruit!!!! We got back at 6:00 pm and the same lady gave us room number 1602 (a large handicapped room). It was very clean and quiet. It seemed the higher that we went the better it got. We did not have a view in room 1602 but it did not matter...because it was so clean and quiet. I would give the hotel 5 stars....if we did not have to go through the first night and the fourth floor dump. I will have to say this...when we went to check the room on the 4th floor...we waited forever... for the elevator...I went downstairs ....while my spouse...waited...by the time that I went to the desk...changed keys...I noticed no spousey...so I hit the 4th floor button. The elevator does not work on the fourth floor...still waiting....yikes!!!!! So if you stay away from the fourth floor and go up as high as possible...your stay will be perfect....and no room 1508 for the internet or AC!!!!"
148,1889,"Apr 3 2009 	hair on walls of shower!!!!!!!	From the moment we arrived things did not go well. The receptionist was extremely rude and unfriendly. we asked to pay our bill in full in cash to which he demanded a 150 dollar deposit on top. Yet when we ordered room service they wouldn't take it against the deposit, they wanted cash for that as well. Then to my horror the first time I had a shower I discovered long hairs on the wall from the previous occupants. We politely asked them to make sure the bathroom was properly cleaned and was met with not so much as an apology or an ounce of caring. when we got back 6 hours later the hairs were still there. We cleaned it ourselves in the end. The room was so dark you had to have the light on all the time. The staff didn't so much as smile at us thewhole time we were there. The only good thing about this hotel was the location extremely near central park and times square which was brilliant and perfect for first time in new york"
149,1889,"Apr 2 2009 	We could not ask for more!	My friend and I were looking for a weekend getaway to NYC and visit some friends in town. It wasn't easy finding a nice, descent looking and most of all inexpensive hotel (specially in Manhattan) I was fearing not to find the hotel to our expectations. My fears dissapeared once we arrived and noticed that the hotel was just what we needed! I belive the best feature of this hotel is it's location, just 3 blocks from Times Square and 2 from Central Park. I may agree on some of the other reviews about the customer service or lack of profesionalism...since there was a small glitch with our hotel room, but no biggie. And the elevator at peak hours...it can get crowded, so either wait or take the stairs, Ah! and local calls aren't free! so maybe use the lobby phone instead of the room's. Other than that we had no complaints as we practially used the room to crash after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. The beds were comfortable, (I miss the pillows lol!) the atmosphere was quiet and no funny smells were found in the room. I strongly recomend Park Central Hotel!Kitchener, ON - Canada"
150,1889,"Mar 28 2009 	no problems would stay again in a seconed	We arrived on the Saturday round 1.30pm, got keys to room straight away, staff very friendly, girl on help desk was great, room was cleaned every day, perfect, only thing i would say was would loved to have had Coffee making facilities, but every thing else was perfect.Drank in bar once on last day, expensive, never ate at hotel, used to go get coffee from starbucks next door and take up to room, lofts never once had a problem, great location great staff and moved go again and recommend to anyone/everyone."
151,1889,"Mar 27 2009 	The perfect location in New York	The Park Central Hotel New York is in a brilliant location on 56th and 7th right in the centre of everything. A 10 minute walk downtown brings you to Times Square, 2 blocks uptown takes you to Central Park, 5th Avenue shopping is just 1 or 2 blocks to the east and a subway station 20 seconds away to take you to wherever else you want to go. Carnegie Hall is directly opposite and the Rockefeller Centre is less than 10 minutes away. The hotel is surrounded by gift shops and cafes and there's a nice little Irish bar just opposite. The location really couldn't get any better. When we first arrived it was difficult for us for find but that was only because we didn't have a map with us and because the grid system is so confusing at first. We were walking up and down for about 20 minutes until we eventually came across it at practically the same place where we started! The 3.5* hotel looks great from the outside with its revolving doors and door men and the reception and lobby area inside is splashed out in marble and looks very classy. We felt a bit trampy arriving in our comfy trousers and trainers looking hot and exhausted from the 8 hour flight and from lugging our suitcases through the streets! We were checked in quickly and shown where the elevators were up to our room. No one came to help us with our cases though which we were expecting. Our room was nice and big which I hear is unusual for New York hotel rooms so we were pleased with that. We did have 2 double beds in the room which was strange as we only needed the one but that didn't bother us we just used one as a bed and one as a big sofa. The TV was absolutely huge! It's by far the biggest one I've ever had in a hotel. They had some great TV channels including news, sports, a lot of Spanish channels(?) and the best channel which showed comedy stuff like The King of Queens and Judge Judy. We also had a small table and a couple of chairs, a big desk, a phone and a digital alarm clock. The bathroom was very clean and they provided good bath products and lotions. My husband used the gym a few times which he said was good. I looked at all the hotel's in this area that had a good location and this was one of the cheapest ones. Although still, admittedly, very expensive, prices are good for a central New York hotel. We paid $1,400 for the week but this wasn't including breakfast (I wouldn't book breakfast here as it's pretty pricey at about 18 a day). At the time I booked it, in August 08, the exchange rate made it about 800. However, as you only reserve the room when you book and you actually pay at the end of your stay, with the new exchange rate in March 09, this worked out to be a lot more at just over 1,000. I wasn't very happy but what can you do that's not the hotel's fault! We only had a couple of problems with the hotel which was that our toilet blocked twice and once it even overflowed which the maid had a fun job of clearing up. We didn't ask for it to be fixed as it happened late at night and by the morning it had cleared itself. Also, some of the staff were a bit miserable some of the time. Some of them were very helpful and friendly though and helped us out whenever we needed something. The concierge desk staff were also helpful in any advice we needed about the city and activities. One other thing that annoyed me was that after I made my reservation I emailed them 3 times with a couple of queries but no one ever got back to me so I eventually had to call them. But my queries were dealt with very well and quickly over the phone. The lifts were also a little slow as there were only 2 lifts for all the floors but they were working on improving these while we were there. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it's one of the cheapest you'll find and it's very modern and the location is just perfect."
152,1889,"Mar 23 2009 	Stay Away!!!	awful service, had a few complaints, when i went to speak to someone they never even responded!!! have absolutkey zero customer service skills and were never accomadating! oh and the bar there, exactly the same.. in addition to the staff looking like they rolled out of bed and came to work, they cursed in front of me and my spouse as if they had no regard for us there. i would NEVER stay there again."
153,1889,"Mar 23 2009	Great Hotel!!	This hotel is great. The service was great; the staff was all very friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated with an excellent view. The bathroom was also very clean and spacious. The location is the best, close to everything in Mid-Town Manhattan. You couldn't ask for a better location. The breakfast buffet was also excellent. it offered a good variety and a nice view. The price was also very reasonable. I went with my 12 year old son for a weekend getaway and we will definitely return to the Park Central the next time we visit NYC. I definitely recommend this hotel."
154,1889,"Mar 23 2009 	You'd be mad not to stay here!	Stayed 6 nights with a friend and got a great deal from the hotel's website which included breakfast. Room was large and airy with 2 double beds and very clean, the only tiny downsize was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room but with so many places nearby to eat &amp; drink and a cafe/bar in the hotel (not to mention one of 751 Starbucks next door!) it really wasn't an issue. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel even has a car service if you don't want to take a taxi to the airport. Central location couldn't have been better, you can see Times Square from outside the hotel and Central Park was only minutes away. Great diner across the road &amp; hotel breakfast was unlimited with a great range of hot &amp; cold choices. This hotel was the cherry on the cake of our brilliant holiday."
155,1889,"Mar 21 2009 	I miss the Westin!!!	Maybe I'm spoiled, typically when we travel to NYC we stay at the Westin. however, someone else in my family made these arrangements and cost was a big issue with several people in our group.The proximity to Central Park is the only thing it had going for it. The front desk had a 4pm check-in..VERY FIRM. I have a hard time believing EVERY ROOM was occupied and that they ALL wouldn't be ready until 4?? To add insult to insult, they would gladly hold our bags for $4/bag.Since we had 5 rooms booked, we quickly learned, that some had &quot;extras&quot; like coffeemakers and some didn't. The hotel was rundown and noisy. The restaurant/bar was very over-priced...even by NYC hotel standards. We were there for a family vacation, and did not let the hotel detract from our time together, but I will NEVER stay there again, nor would I recommend, there are several other &quot;economical&quot; choices in Times Square."
156,1889,"Mar 18 2009 	Lacks Customer Service	I had read the previous reviews on this hotel regarding their customer service and was a little skeptical in staying there at first and figured that I got a good rate, what the heck. But everything I read about it was true. This hotel has the worst customer service in the city. The front desk staff was ok, but everyone else was nasty and rude. I voiced my complaint to the General Manager who apparently didnt care much, since his reply was that they were too busy because of an event taking place there at the time I stayed, my reply was that this was no reason for the rudeness and nastiness, I was a paying customer and should be treated with respect."
157,1889,"Mar 9 2009 	good location	The location of this hotel is excelent, five minute walk from central park and times square and right next to the subway. The reception was always crawded so the attention was not very good. The rooms are big and comfortable but the bathroom had no heat so we literally froze everytime we entered.The day we left, we had to check out in the morning but since our flight left at night they offered us a place to store our luggage while we waited. After a couple of hours we went to pick it up, and surprise!! they charged us per hour per bag. Nobody said anything to us before and we ended up paying a considerable amount of money.I would only recomend this hotel for the location"
158,1889,"Mar 9 2009 	Location great hotel okay	We stayed 2 nights in early March. Check-in is at 4:00, but we arrived at 2:00. We had booked a &quot;Concierge King&quot; - according to the website, they are on floors 18-25 and have better views. We were told a king wasn't ready, but we could have a double queen right away if we wanted. No problem, we said we'd wait. We were told to try again in an hour. We did, and a 2nd clerk told us our room wasn't ready; try again at 4:00. We returned at 4:00, were served by a different clerk again who gave us our key, and then we got to our room to find we had been placed in a double queen! Back to the lobby we went; we were told the hotel was full, sorry for the confusion, and were given a regular King room on the 10th floor and had a view of a brick wall. Oh well. Our room was clean, the bed comfortable, the housekeeping staff very nice. Our room was in need of a some maintenance; the hairdryer was off the wall, one outlet was off the wall, one of the lamps was really hard to turn on and off, and the clock radio didn't work at all. Cosmetic things, mostly, but a little disappointing that they would be left like that.Considering I got the room for $118 US/night and it included a full buffet breakfast for both of us (which we really enjoyed), I think it was worth it. The location is excellent; Times Square is just a few blocks away (walk within 10 minutes), you can see Central Park from the front of the hotel, and Seventh Avenue is quite lively in the evening. We felt quite safe the entire time. A subway stop is right by the hotel. I can usually overlook the little things, like broken clocks; however, no matter how nice the hotel or good the deal is, when I feel as though I have not received what I booked and/or paid for, it makes it hard to give the hotel a great rating."

160,1889,"Mar 8 2009 	Through the snow to an amazing vacation.	I'm not going to spend much time elaborating on the location of the Park Central. It is in the middle of everything that you could possibly want to see. However, I want to talk about the amazing staff that we encountered at Park Central. We were scheduled to stay there from March 2 to March 5 which we nearly missed because of the storms raging the eastern states. We ended up driving to Boston (original flight was scheduled out of Bangor), flying out of there, and still making it for our first night in NYC. After hearing about our adventure, especially as it was the first vacation my boyfriend and I were taking together, the lady at the front desk upgraded our room to one with a better view. She didn't have to, and we didn't ask, but we were so happy that she was kind enough to think of that. If you can ask for a specific room, I highly recommend Rm 1805. She upgraded us to a room where we could look left and see Central Park, and look right to see Times Square. Amazing. Both of us know where we are going to stay the next time we go to New York- Park Central!"
161,1889,"Mar 8 2009 	Park Central - Fantastic location - Great Xmas Stay	Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Park Central NY on 19-23 Dec 2008. This was our first visit to New York and was a place I have always wanted to visit at Xmas since watching movies like Home Alone 2. We spent hours searching for the right hotel and realised to stay at a nice hotel would not be cheap. We stummbled across the Park Central and read great reviews we booked direct through the Park Central website and got a great deal as they had a sale on with 50% off.We landed in the evening of teh 19th and there was a foot of snow it was incredible, we got a taxi from Newark airport to the Park Central which cost about $80. Check in was painless and we upgraded to a deluxe room which was a disabled room so the bathroom was enormous. There were decorations and trees through the hotel lobby which was very welcoming. We stayed on one of the higher floors which gave a fantastic views of the snow covered streets. The hotel was set in a fantastic location, we brought NY books and thought we would spend a lot of money on taxis. On our first day we ventured out to find our bearings and realised that central park was two minutes up the road and five minutes in the other direction was Times square. We paid $75 for a sightseeing bus which we did not see as value for money. We got the subway ($7 for 7 trips) to the ferry point and got the statton island ferry (which is free) around the statue of liberty and got fantastic views of manhatten also. We also visited groud zero and the highlight of the trip was a night visit to the Empire State Building which gave some fantastic views.For Xmas I got my girlfriend tickets to see the Little Mermaid on Broadway which she loved. The show was incredible and was significantly better than any show i have seen in Londons West End. The cast and costumes were fantastic and the theatre was at a great location. Shopping wise we probablty didnt do as much as we thought we visited fifth avenue and went in Macys, TIffanys etc and one of our favourite shops Abercrombie was quite expensive compared to Florida which we have previously visited. American Eagle gave great value for money. I would also recommend visiting the Virgin Megastore , NBA store and Nintendo StoreEvery morning we crossed the road for breakfast at the Cafe Metro which was great food and good value for money. We ate at various restaurants and would recommend Planet Hollywood and Applebees.The snow and all the decorations really made this a fantastic stay and as a massive fan of Xmas I enjoyed it immensley. We went to the rockefeller centre and saw the big tree and walked through the snow covered central park. I would recommend New York and the Park Central Hotel to everyone the stay was fantastic and I would love to go again."
162,1889,"Mar 5 2009 	Friendly and clean	The hotel room was clean, the staff was polite and friendly. The location was very convenient. Very affordable as well."
163,1889,"Mar 4 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!!!	I stayed at the Park Central for 2 nights - Sunday and Monday. Check in was easy, staff was nice. Hotel was full of groups but nice and clean. The hotel is older which is evident in the halls. The room was bigger than expected. Very clean. Bathroom was big and clean. Nice ammennities. I was really happy. We had a double, double room. I will stay here again. It is perfect location across from Carnegie Hall and a block and a half from Letterman studios. Just a couple block from Times Square. Nice bar and nice restuarant in the lobby as well."
164,1889,"Mar 1 2009 	Loved every min	I have just returned from staying in the Park Central hotel for 6 nights with my parents, this is my third time in New york and i would def go back and stay in this hotel it was perfect in everyway. When we arrived our room wasnt ready but we knew this might happen as it states this on their website that check in is frm 4pm so we just went next door to have a coffee in starbucks. When we got to our room it was perfect 2 nice size beds ,plasma tv, lovely clean bathroom coffee making facilites it was just perfect. Location was even better when you step out of the front door and turn to your right times square was hitting us in the face, we were only a 5 mins walk from there and if u turned left you were right into central park it was just perfect. We stayed on the breakfast package which saved us a fortune, you can have whatever you like from a hot breakfast to cereals, fruit, pastries, waffles, and juices. We also ate in the restaurant for dinner twice and both times the food was fantastic. There is nothing in this hotel that i could fault, the staff were very friendly and would help you out if you needed any info from sightseeing to eating out. If your looking for a central hotel thats always busy with people coming and going this is the perfect hotel for you."
165,1889,"Mar 1 2009 	Excelent Location good hotel.	We booked this hotel as we were told it was centrally located and it definatrly was; there was a subway on the corner to take you to the upper or lower ides, and more importantly it was less than 2 minutes walk from Central Park and as you leave the hotel Carnegie Hall faces you to to your right is Time Square within a 5 minute walk. I would definately rate this hotel for its location, price and uitability for those people wanting to be able to walk to the main tourist attractions. The hotel itself wa clean enough and the room serviced every day to a high standard, when we go back to new york next year for a 5 day trip we will book this hotel.On a balanced review though I must admit that there was no tea/cofee facilities in the rooms nor the hotel, and thus you had to buy your own. However ther is a stand outside elling decent enough cofee and tea for $1.30 and a whole wealth eateries around the hotel to explore - I would recomend Fluffys for a breakfast bagel, and the cofee shop next door called something like Carnegie hall Cakes sold the worlds best cheesecake, even if it is $12 a slice with tax! on the subjec of tax New York it a city where a different tax is levied on everything so please ceck, and if you go to the big department stores go to te buest service area and get your tax free card to ensre you dont pa the taxes!All in all New York is a great place to stay and if you want a hotel with a great location and an affordable price Park Central is worth stying at if you do not plan to hang around the hotel and want to actually enjoy New York!"
166,1889,"Feb 28 2009 	A wecome sight at the end of a long day when you come up the steps from the metro	As the heading said a welcome sight as you come up from the metro system at the end of the day. The hotel is ideally situated on a metro line just around the corner from Central Park and a very short stroll from the hustle and bustle of Times Square.We stayed at the NEW YORKER last visit and tended to compare the two hotels, but both are ideally located the only downside to this hotel was lack of a bath plug and a very short bath! At the end of the flight or from just walking each day it would have been lovely to have stretched out in a nice hot bath. We used tissue to bung the hole then put the plug on top so we did use the bath, but as I said a longer one would have been better.Broadway is the block behind the hotel, here you will find Mama Mia and the famous Iridium Club where Les Paul still plays on a Monday eve. On the corner of the winter gardens theatre is a traditional American Dinner where wanna be staff sing there way throughtout your time in there! Althought the bill spoilt it a bit, as after the staff had send a bucket around for there tips etc the bill then had a 18% surcharge on it which made the meal a little on the steep side. There is a little shop called Fuffys dinner across the road from the hotel that has a great cheap menu and the staff are great, will explain stuff or make reccomendations. We bought city pass tickets which saved us quite alot of money as it covers most things visitors want to do in New York. Once again a great visit, we have seen New york from top to bottom and loved every minute."
167,1889,Feb 26 2009 	Best Weekend Ever!	My now fiance and I spent a weekend at Park Central and it was incredible. We got an amazing deal through their own website which was nearly 50% of what they typically charge.For the best rate check their website. The hotel is in probably the best location in NYC 2 blocks south from Central Park and approximately 7-10 blocks north of Times Square and then another 2-4 blocks from Rockefeller Center. The rooms were just big enough and were very clean. I would recommend this for anyone it was a great place to stay and very affordable especially in NYC! It was a truly unforgettable weekend especially because we got engaged in Central Park ...I'll never forget it!
168,1889,Feb 26 2009 	Excellent Location	Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Stepped out of elevator on 5th floor and cigarette smell strong in hall and room even though room non-smoking.Changed rooms cause room not very clean. Got to 2nd room on the 6th floor no cigarette smell but it was not ready. Left our bags in closet and came back hours later. Room ready but carpet not vacuumed well and small blood stains on carpet. Bathroom clean but smelled sour. Too exhausted to change again so wore shoes and avoided stain. Bed comfortable with nice linens. Large flat screen T.V. Street view recommended. On check-out left bags for a few hours and it cost 3.75 per bag. For check-in leaving bags 1.50 per bag. Room service ends 10pm. Elevators very slow. All in all location made it worth the stay. Subway across the street. Theaters and Times square close but not too close. Good cafe for coffee and pastries etc .next door. Felt safe.
169,1889,"Feb 25 2009 	A Good Bet	This is the second time in 6 months my family has spent a brief sojourn at this hotel. As others have noted, the location is excellent as the hotel is truly &quot;central&quot; to all Manhattan has to offer. Walk to Central Park, Times Square, Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Center. Hop the subway just outside the door to anywhere in NYC.  During both our first and second stays, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. On our first visit, my daughter left her music player in the room (we discovered after checking out) and we were pleased that Hotel Security was able to retrieve this valuable item. On our second visit, a mistake was made and the room we were assigned already had guests in it. For the trouble, we were given 2 full complimentary breakfasts for the next day.  We found our King bedded room to be more spacious than one with 2 doubles, but both rooms had ample living space and were CLEAN. Housekeeping did a fine job.  Further, the hotel is quiet! We never experienced hallway or street noise. For both of our stays, we had a wonderful rate through an internet site of less that $150 per night. For this price, we would happily return to the Park Central as our NYC home."
170,1889,"Feb 25 2009 	Comfortable beds clean rooms great location	Comfortable beds, clean rooms and very helpful staff made our stay most enjoyable. The hotel is in a great location - 400 metres from Central Park, across the road from Carnegie Hall and a twelve minute walk from Times Square. There is a tour bus stop twenty feet away where you can get a blue bus to take you on a downtown, hop on/hop off tour taking in all the major sites such as Empire State, Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Centre and more. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel though, it is very expensive and there are plenty of cheaper places to eat an excellent breakfast within 100 metres (we ate at the Parisienne which was good value). There are dedicated machines in reception for checking in for your flights home and the guest desk will print off your boarding passes. the only downside for us was the noisy room cleaning staff in the mornings. They chatted loudly in the corridors from early on. Otherwise an excellent value-for-money hotel and would definitely stay there again. My 16 year old daughter thought it was excellent as it was within 50 metres of an Ugg boot store."
171,1889,"Feb 23 2009 	watch out for valet parking	watch your valuables! If you use the valet parking service better take everything with you when you leave your car: loose change, maps, kleenex, breath mints, and everything else. The car parking staff have magnetic fingers, which will attract anything that isn't bolted down."
172,1889,"Feb 23 2009 	Location excellent	We stayed here for a week. We found the staff very helpful the room cleaned daily. The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and Broadwayb shows.Breakfast was noy included in our deal and we thought it was alittle expensive but a great selection of food. the bar was lovely for a nightcap.We will certainly use this hotel when we visit New York again."
173,1889,Feb 20 2009 	Amazing Location and great hotel for city break	Booked this hotel through expedia.com and was unsure of the hotel due to reviews on trip advisor. Arrived at the hotel at night and was greated by the amazing lights and sights of times sqaure which is just about 5 blocks from the hotel. Upon arriving at the room on the 11 floor we were amazed by the size of the room and also the size of the bed!Had no problems with any house keeping always clean when we arrived back at the hotel in the evening after a long day walking around New York. Enjoyed every day in this hotel and can not wait to go back.
174,1889,"Feb 19 2009 	I enjoyed my time here	This hotel is in a great location,5 mjns from time square and 2 mins from central park.The staff was friendly and helpfull.The bar staff and restaurant staff are great would do anything for you. The room was big with a big flat tv (GREAT). The room service was great they was in our room everyday. I found the lifts where ok at times but they can get busy around about checking in time 4PM. I would go back to this hotel."
175,1889,Feb 19 2009 	No problems....Fantastic stay would recommend to anyone	I have no idea why this hotel has received bad reviews. Service was fantastic and friendly at all times. Room was extremely spacious and clean and there were no problems with housekeeping. I am also confused regarding all the negative comments about the lifts! Never waited more than 15-20 seconds for a lift and we were there for a week. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
176,1889,"Feb 19 2009 	Can't wait to see New York again..........	We booked this hotel by hazard and would choose it again anytimeWe had a package deal room,parking and breakfast who was perfect for us It is right near Broadway,central park and we could walk anywhere and felt secureIt's a very clean area and many subway entrances nearbyWe enjoyed very much to assist to the medical comedy ChicagoCan't wait to return and explore more"
177,1889,"Feb 18 2009 	A great stay albeit a bit basic	Having read recent reviews I think we may have been lucky. We were warned that hotel rooms in NY were small, but we were pleasantly suprised as it was a good size. We got a kingsize bed, which was lovely and comfortable and the room was clean and quite. The facilities in the room are basic, e.g no coffee/tea making facilities, poor toiletries (we had 2 conditioners and 2 body wash. The shampoo arrived on the 3rd day, after we'd bought some) and the hairdryer is very dated and cuts out when it gets hot, so bring your own.But really, these were very minor things and overall we enjoyed staying in the room. We never experienced rudeness from the staff but then again, we didn't have many dealings with them.The breakfast was expensive so we avoided it, but we ate there one evening and opted for their set menu for the night which was a lot cheaper than chosing from the menu. We had steak for the main course which was the best steak we've eaten, especially as it would have been the cheap cut. We tried to do the same thing at a very popular and recommended Rosie O'gradys restaurant along the road and it was terrible.If you want a hotel that is in a good location and you only want it to get a good comfortable nights sleep, then we'd recommend it."
178,1889,"Feb 18 2009 	Fantastic location	As previously stated in other reviews House Keeping is very hit and miss. We had two rooms one of which did not have the bed made after the first night. The toilet was not clean and had evidence of the previous occupants left in it!! The bath was dirty. The shower gels etc were not re-newed. IF YOUR A NON SMOKER DO NOT HAVE A ROOM ON THE 5TH FLOOR. The reason being, it appears, is that half of this floor is reserved for smokers and with the air con system non smoking rooms ARE affected. When we left all clothing had to be washed due to smoke smell. The corridors on this floor stink of smoke. We did not eat at the hotel but looking at their prices they are comparable with what we were paying out and about. You pay for the location which is superb. The bed we had was comfy and the room was warm. No in room tea or coffee making facilities, which we are used to in the UK. If your used to used to catching buses you'll love this place as you wait ages for a lift and then two come together. Would stay there again due to location."
179,1889,"Feb 16 2009 	All about location	We stayed 5 nights at the Park Central. We thought our room was a decent size for a King in Manhatten, definately comapred to what you get in Europe. We had a chair and a desk and a large flatscreen television. We did not have a remote though and couldn't be bothered enquiring about one. Everything seemed clean (except for the pair of undies under the bed) and the bed was so soft - better than home. The bathroom was functional, but the staff seemed to have trouble replacing the shower products, as we ended up woth 4 body lotions, so I suggest taking your own.There is an ice machine on each floor (no fridge in room) and a drinks vendor, but wasn't working. The elevators here are terrible, out of the 4 available maybe 2 were working. Sometimes it could take 5 minutes to get one from your floor. From the lobby they have a silly system whereby you press your floor and get told which one to go to - ignore this and just get in the next one available. The bar/restaurant attached is expensive ($9 for a bottle of Bud) and the bar makes final call at midnight. The concierge office was quite helpful for us.This hotel is all about price and location. we originally booked about August 08 for about $135 a night, but realising a week before we left the price was only $100, we cancelled (allowable free up until day before) and rebooked at the new price - a saving of about $200. I think I overheard the price if you were to show up on the day was still only $109. Dont forget to add all the taxes to these prices (and for NY accomodation there are a lot).The location is on 7th between 55th and 56th Streets. Upon leaving the front door - looking right you can see the ball they drop in times square on New Years Eve on 43rd St, and looking left 3 blocks away is Central Park where the horse and carriage rides go from (The south end is close to the ice skating too). Across the road is Carnegie Hall and on the next block is the &quot;worlds best&quot; Carnegie Deli where many famous people are pictured and they sell a club sandwich with a pound of meat for about $22. We would have gone but the queue was always very long when we were in the area. The closest subway station is next door, but if you walk 2 blocks south to 53rd St the E line subway goes towards JFK airport (change at the stop before Jamaica and follow signs for Airtrain). The Airtrain is $5 and the subway $2 - takes just over an hour and very cheap. If you have heavy luggage there are stairs at 53rd st station though. There is also a stop for the Citysights Hop on/off bus 2 blocks north which we did, and other local buses I assume.Overall I think the hotel is set-up purely as a base for holiday makers as the city has so much more to offer, but for the price and location there isn't too much to complain about."
180,1889,"Feb 9 2009 	Good hotel shame about the check-in staff	Booked our trip through Expedia at, what I consider a good rate for the area (170 for 2 nights).We arrived at the hotel and must admit the hotel is very well presented from the outside.My only main negative experience we received was the front desk. At check-in we were greeted by a very rude member of staff who said our request of a king room, as booked, would not be humoured and we would have to have a twin. I was very angry at this...why would I want twin beds when we are on a romantic weekend!?! The member of staff said room type is never guaranteed and therefore we will have to have a twin.I was not having any of it, and pointed out we had booked a double and we would not accept a twin under any circumstances...After much huffing from the member of staff he said he would get a double room cleaned and that we would have to wait two hours or a room. I'd like to point out that we were checking in at 7pm! He said we could leave our bags but it would be $3.50 for the two bags. We did this reluctantly and went for a quick look around Times Square which is literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel.Went back to the hotel at 9pm and was checked into our double room with no aggravation. Noted that the person who had served us originally was no longer at the desk (thank goodness as my blood had boiled at his rudeness).Got to the room and I was very pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. Bed was huge and very comfy and the bathroom was clean and had everything you need. As mentioned before on reviews, this hotel meets a 3* room standard so as long as your not expecting anything else you'll be fine.Ice machine and drinks machine just outside the room but noticed no noises from people using them.TV was good, plenty of channels to keep you entertained should you need it.Never ate in the hotel but from what I could see it seemed a rip-off ($25.00 each for breakfast). Go somewhere else and eat there.The bar is small but very nicely appointed. Lots of candles and really warm and cosy. Bar staff very nice and they make a great Long Island Ice Tea (if you don't mind $36 for 2 drinks).Concierge were very helpful with any questions we had.Room was cleaned to a good standard and have no complaints there.Check out was easy and quick.So, overall, as long as you don't get the bad service form the check-in staff I think you'll have a good experience of this hotel."
181,1889,"Feb 6 2009 	Very Good Deal for Family Trip	My wife booked the room and I was a bit nervous because of some mixed reviews I saw. We got 2 dbl beds for two nights and breakfast for 4, free parking for $420 plus tax. An excellent deal.The free breakfast was actually very good. Large selection in the buffet and polite staff. The rooms were average, not at all fancy and the beds a bit small but we were there to enjoy NYC and not to stay in the room.Great location and a short stroll to Times Square."
182,1889,"Feb 5 2009 	Frustrating	THE GOOD:Location, price (hard to beat $100/night in Manhattan!), stylish rooms.THE BAD:Crowded lobby, unfriendly &amp; sparse staff, low standards, slow &amp; disfunctional elevators, bad housekeeping.-We were assigned two rooms before our final room which upon entering discovered they hadn't received housekeeping from the previous guests.-Typical to always see a line of guests in the lobby waiting to be helped at the front desk. Front desk was always understaffed. -Tipped housekeeping $10/day (trying to avoid neglect read about in previous reviews), and STILL didn't get crap. Looked like it was up to whoever was cleaning that day which things got done. -Heard horror stories about elevators every day from other guests. Also experienced problems ourselves. *Read all the bad reviews before I went but still wanted to take advantage of the cheap rate. I really thought I'd get lucky and not experience what I read about. No such luck. I really did experience what other reviewers complained about. Pretty bad."
183,1889,"Feb 4 2009 	good location but noisy and rude	We stayed there for 9 nights, On the day we arrived we had to change room because it was dirty and some of the things in the room were broken (eg: safebox)It was a very very noisy hotel, And after staying for 10 days we had to pay $ 4 for each bag we left just for about 2 hours until we went to the airport!!!! Some of the people at the front desk were specially rude.The location is amazing, and the rooms are confortable."
184,1889,"Feb 2 2009 	Where did everyone else stay!!!	Went to NYC for a birthday trip with my girlfriend 23rd -28th Jan.As has been said many times before the absolute best feature of this hotel is its location. Five minutes from central park, 5 minutes from Broadway/Time Square, 5 minutes from main midtown shopping on 6th/5th Ave and subway stations right outside the hotel.We got a very good deal through an online travel site (flights+hotel for 1100 total). This good price is why after we read some not so good reviews on tripadvisor we didnt mind that much. After all you get what you pay for.On arrival the hotel seemed nice and modern, if dark in the reception. Checking in was no problem around 5pm and the room was fine. Exactly what I would expect from a 3 STAR hotel. Nothing wonderful, but just good quality adequate furnishings and decor.Admittedly we never ate at the hotel (but why would you in New York!) The cafe Europa and the little deli that made its own bread a couple of blocks in the direction of central park were great for a simple breakfast and theres plenty of other dinners/restaurants nearby to sample. We never had any problems with rude staff and found all our questions/requests answered/met to a standard we were happy with. Checking out was easy and quick and we were offered a hotel taxi to JFK. This was a good idea. JFK to Manhattan is a flat fare $45 plus tolls (~$55 including tip) The trip back to JFK is metered not a flat fare so the chances of the meter ticking over while we sat in NYC traffic would add to the cost. The hotel SUV was spacious, comfortable and at $60 flat fare- value for money.Park Central is not the Plaza or the Ritz, its a normal 3-star hotel and if your willing to take it as that and not expect 4 star services and features then its a great place to base a trip to New York City. After all you get what you pay for, like it or lump it."
185,1889,"Jan 28 2009 	great hotel and would go back!!	I went to new york on the 5th nov 2008 and stayed at the park central hotel on 7th av and 56th st. we arrived in newark airport at 12 noon so when we got to are hotel we was very tired. as we pulled up to the hotel there was a porter waiting to get or bags from us. we arrived at the hotel about 1.30pm and not soposed to get cheaked in to our room till 4 pm, because we was very tired from a 8 hour flight we decided to ask can we check in early. the staff was very understanding and found us a room that was availble and checked us in straight away. when we got to our room we decided to go asllep for a little bit to get over the flight. At about 7.30pm my girlfriend woke me up to a loud siren going off, at first i thought it was the safe of something and it went off so i went back asleep, next thing i knew it was going off again so i decided to go out into the corridor to see what was going on, when i opened the door the whole corridor was full of smoke and had a very bad burning smell. next thing we knew the whole of the hotel was evacuated because there was a fire on our floor. we was all in the lobby for about 3 hours and then we got let back to our rooms after about 16 fire trucks and 60 firefighters solved the problem, bad start but from then the hotel was great and when we arranged to get taken to the airport from the hotel staff there was a limousine waiting for us which put a great end to an amazing trip to new york."
186,1889,"Jan 20 2009 	A terrific hotel and a great value	I booked this hotel in mid-January for 2 nights in order to see a concert at Lincoln Center. The location is quiet and has lots of wonderful restaurants and shops nearby, including the shops at Columbus Circle just a short stroll away. I checked in 3 hours early and there was no problem with this, and was also given a better room without my even asking. There is a coffee service in the room, which I didn't know about, but which came in handy as the time we stayed in NYC it was unusually cold .Breakfast, which was included, was a terrific deal. The cafe in which it is served is really lovely, on the ground floor with windowd looking out on 7th Ave. Service is wonderful and the food and selection is very good. I highly recommend the waffles which you make yourself. This is served with real maple syrup - not imitation. You can get scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, porridge, fresh fruit, dried fruit, cold cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, etc.The room was very well appointed and the beds were comfortable. The hotel was packed but we never heard any noise on our floor, the 24th (this is the concierge level). We talked to lots of other guests, in the hallways and elevators, and everyone we met was delightful.We got a wonderful rate booking directly thru the hotel website.I can't say enough about the hotel - if you need to stay on the Upper West Side I highly recommend it."
187,1889,"Jan 19 2009 	Very disappointing	We used to live in NY and came back for a weekend to see friends. The Park Central has a good location, and offered a decent rate. That's about the extent of the good.When we arrived, the front desk clerk, Angela, was incredibly rude. We were early, and she told us a room was ready. About 10 seconds later, she said that one of her fellow clerks had just booked it, so it wasn't. ...OK. Strangely disorganized. Then, she said she could check us in early. I asked how that would help (as in, if the room wasn't ready, what would it matter? simply curious, not rude at all) and she barked, &quot;I'm TRYING to help you!&quot; She then insisted that I remove my ID from my wallet, though I was struggling to get it out, because she HAD to have it on the desk next to her rather than look at it through the plastic window. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but I've stayed at a lot of hotels, and it was odd. We were guests, and she treated us like our presence was a massive inconvenience. A woman we spoke to later, whose name I didn't get, also needed to see ID but didn't seem to care that it was in my wallet.We went to drop off our bags since we were going out for the afternoon and the room wasn't ready, and were told we had to pay to have them held, though we were guests at the hotel. As my husband said ... it's just &quot;chintzy.&quot; It just seems like they go out of their way to nickel-and-dime the guests.The room was fine. No coffee maker, tiny shower, no extra blankets, etc. Completely bare-bones.The elevators creaked - loudly - all day and night. Also, as other reviewers have stated, a 10-minute wait for them is more common than not. When I entered the hotel one day, someone was stuck in the elevator and maintenance was trying to get her out.A few other things. As we were waiting for the elevator (as usual), two employees were arguing loudly right next to us. Just very unprofessional in front of paying guests. The soda machine didn't work. Many of these things wouldn't be a big deal on their own, but combined, they just left a bad taste in our mouths. If you're so excited about NYC that all you care about is a good location, stay here. If you'd like to be treated humanely in a place that doesn't seem to be in disrepair, don't. We'd never stay here again."
188,1889,"Jan 19 2009 	perfect Location...	Stayed 8th Jan - 12th Jan 2009This Hotel is the best location possible for anyone visitng New York for the first time. We went for a week to celebrate my birthday and it was just fantastic the city is amazing.The staff were friendly, the room was a good size &amp; clean, we had read reviews of the bathroom lighting being poor but we were on the 12th floor and had absolutley no complaints on this hotel. Its just 2 blocks up from Time Square and 2 blocks down from Central Park, there are plenty of Subway stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel.We recommend you eat at as Patis &amp; Vendo in the Meatpacking distrcit. (DO NOT EAT AT KITTICHAI, they gave me food poisoning and offered me free lunch as compensation, very odd - why would you eat where you got ill??)This hotel is excellent and a reasonable rate for the great location. We will be sure to stay here again on our next visit to New York!"
189,1889,Jan 18 2009 	great location and price	Wife and I just returned from a weekend trip to Park Central. The purpose of the trip was to celebrate a friends birthday. 10 couples stayed at PCNY. After reading some reviews I was nervous. the planning phase of the trip was rocky as the rates we were quoted changed 3 times.The second time we never received a confirmation so we had to rebook...at another rate. The service during the booking phase was far below par for any hotel. When we checked in we were told that we had 2 seperate reservations....both at different rates. We took the cheaper one and the guy behind the counter was nice about it. The room itself was small but cozy. Bedding was good and the maid service was prompt. The location of the hotel is its best feature. The mid town address is really close to everything. It was always easy to get a cab and there are great places to eat very close to the hotel. There is also a Duane Reed (SP??) Drug store about a block away so we stocked up on Diet Coke and water at the store rather than pay $6 for a diet coke in the restaurant. Our floor did have a vending machine but it did not work. My stay was pleasant but I did see some things that I must warn about. First off...the waitress in the bar was horribly rude. apparently you cannot take a cup of coffe or a bottle of water into the bar area or she will be fired...or so she said in a sharp tone. The concierge was less than friendly but it think she was over worked. One day I left the hotel at 8 am and she gave me quick directions. When I returned that evening around 6 she was still working. This hotel looked like it was popular with large groups. The groups really kept the concierge very busy. Fortunately we traveled with people who were familiar with the city so we did not really need the concierge services. If you will need Concierge services be VERY aware that this may become an issue for you. The elevator comments you may have read are factual. The room temprature comments are factual...but we found the outdated AC/Heating system was OK to control. And last...our room 2027 had no view but it was VERY quiet. We were happy with this trade off.Overall I would give this place a 6.5 out of 10. I would stay here again for what we paid...which was $169/night the first time we booked...then it went to $98 per night...and the final price was about $112 per night. Next time we will probably spend a little more $$ and try another place.
190,1889,"Jan 12 2009 	Missing Hospitality	Park Central NY is in an ideal location, just steps from Times Square, Central Park, and so much more. Other than the location, there's not much going for it. During our visit, no one welcomed us to the hotel, the doorman and bell captain were nowhere to be found, and the front desk clerk was disinterested. It was a quiet time in NY, given the economy, weather, and all -- so we would have expected a warm welcome. But hospitality doesn't seem to be a strong suit here. Rooms are adequate, though noisy (room-to-room and hallway noise is considerable). Rooms and bathrooms were clean. But the lack of attention to guests was astounding. With just a little bit of attention to guest relations, this hotel could be a gem."
191,1889,"Jan 6 2009 	Great Location	We stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of Dec and as this was my first visit to New York I really wanted it to be special (plus it was our 3 year anniversary). We had originally booked the Hotel Pennsylvania but after reading so many terrible reviews we had to find somewhere else, so we found the Park Central.The location of this hotel was fantastic. Somehow when you look at it on a map it seems like it was a really long walk from anywere and having never been to New York I didn't realise the distances etc. But the hotel was only a 5/10 minute walk to Times Square and a little shorter to central park. The subway was right on the corner by the hotel so that was really handy also, although we found that being tourists we wanted to use the Gray Line buses.The staff in the hotel were ok, not overly friendly but did their job. We did have one issue where the safe in our room wasn't working and we were advised that they were in the process of all being upgraded etc and that we were unfortunate that we had an old one. We were given the option of changing rooms, which would mean that we packed up and left our luggage in the luggage room and hoped that they had a spare room that afternoon, or that we use the safe behind reception. To be honest, they couldn't do much more and it was our choice that we decided to stay in the room we originally had and we didn't have any problems.The room we had was fine, yes it needed a bit of work, but it was only minor things that really don't bother you when all you want to do is have a good night sleep. The beds were comfy and managed to almost sleep through the night (that was the jetlag though!). The showers weren't very powerful and as my hair is quite thick it did take me a while to rinse the shampoo through, but then I'm unfortunate to have thick hair!The lifts were a really good idea I thought. They have a touch screen in the reception with floor numbers on, press your floor number and they'll tell you which lift to get in, by the time you got to the lift it was sitting there waiting for you and no one else could nick it as all the floor numbers are pre-set.All in all we had a lovely stay at the hotel. Fair enough the rooms weren't the Ritz but lets face it, if you could afford the Ritz you woudn't be booking here anyway. You can't deny that the location is fantastic and the beds are comfortable and yes I may be easy to please but thats good enough for me."
192,1889,"Jan 6 2009 	Great value for the money	I stayed four nights in early January for business. The room was booked by a colleague and I was honestly horrified when I saw the room rate...I figured we were staying in a dump for that rate. :'} But, this hotel is a favorite of some of our traveling companions and was highly recommeded.For the money, I can't imagine a better choce. As others have noted, the location is phenomenal. The room is small for other cities, but perfectly expected for NYC. It is certainly not a luxury selection, but it is comfortable and clean. I spent a good amount of time in the room working and I wasn't overly crowded.I didn't bother with the restaurant as there are so many great choices for all your meals around the hotel. Seems like a shame to eat hotel food when in NYC. The only minor complaint was that housekeeping didn't do such a great job the first day. No soap, floor had not been vaccuumed, coffee maker left dirty and un-emptied, no privacy hanger left in room. I called their customer service line and politely explained. The next service was much better.Sure, the elevators are slow and crowded, but I have experienced this in other older hotels. I had a room on the 25th floor, so even when I had to wait, I always got a spot on the hotel. Felt sorry for folks on lower floors with their luggage trying to get down. Make sure you get a room on the top floors or consider checking out very early and checking your bags if the wait is too much of an inconvenience."
193,1889,"Jan 4 2009 	Average with confused staff	We selected an &quot;all-in-one&quot; package deal to include breakfast, free self parking and 30% discount at the hotel bar. The accomodations, food were fine. The location is great. The hotel is very centrally located close to everything you want to see as a tourist. The hotel staff had no idea about the promotion package which we found on their website and we were repeatedly asked/challenged about the specifics of our package. I luckily printed out a detailed confirmation page whenever I booked it online because I had to present thepage to staff at least four times and they made 2 copies of it while we there. It got a little ridiculous. However, the deal was great and made the stay extrmely affordable. Reccommend printing out the confirmation sheet with the details of your package or you will likely not receive all that you signed up for."
194,1889,"Jan 4 2009 	What A Nightmare...	I was looking for a nice hotel located centrally in New York City, close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, and a subway line. Park Central seemed to be a perfect match to my needs, and with an advertised online price of $99, how could you not love that, right? I had read reviews on Hotels.com and although some thought that the rooms were a bit small, everyone reviewing kept raving about the location, and the value for the price.Well, none of that matters when the reservation you've made is not honored. Upon arriving at the front desk around 2pm on a Friday afternoon, the front desk clerk asked me to step out of line and walked me down the hallway to the manager's desk where there were two men and a woman waiting in front of me. What we were all being told is that there was a problem with the hotel's website when the reservation was made and that the hotel was oversold by 80 rooms. They had made arrangements for us at another hotel in the city (The Carlton on Madison Avenue - a BEAUTIFUL hotel, but certainly NOT anywhere near the locations listed above that were central to our trip), but after parking in a garage next to Park Central, the hotel only offered us $20 to get our vehicle out of the garage and NO transportation to The Carlton.The attitude of the employees of Park Central seemed to indicate that this was not out of the ordinary for this hotel, and although apologies were offered for our inconvenience, I think you can understand how disappointed we were to not be staying where we had a reservation, but also to not be notified that there was a problem BEFORE our arrival. The hotel had both my cell phone number and Email address and no attempt to contact me prior to my arrival had been made. I would gladly have driven to The Carlton instead, but to park in a garage in Manhattan and only be offered the $20 to get the car out (what we would have been charged for our half hour at the garage) is completely unacceptable.I wish I could give you details about the room as Park Central looked to be an older yet beautiful hotel, but we never got to see the room. When you're staying at a better hotel while on a trip for pleasure, I think that the hotel's service is every bit as important as its physical attrbutes, but when a hotel can't live up to its end of the bargain, the very least a hotel can do is to own up to its mistake, Park Central failed to do this."
195,1889,"Jan 1 2009 	Park Central - A Good Stay	My buddy &amp; I spent 6 hrs. @ our local coffee house reviewing hotels on various sites for our trip to NYC. My friend &amp; I booked a 6-day stay (12/17-12/22) at the Park Central; many reviews were great, other were hate, but we'd give it a shot. We arrived, we're greeted by Saleem, a friendly counter clerk. He was fast, polite &amp; answered all our questions. We got to our room (#1029), (2) double-beds, facing the dreaded center core of the bldg. (no view which is often the norm in NY from what I'm told) &amp; the faceplate on the closet safe had been torn off; so couldn't use the safe, which we needed. I called &amp; spoke to a rep, requesting another room due to the safe issue; she said there weren't any. My friend called &amp; spoke to a man who understood the problem, he patched us thru to Customer Manager. My friend explained having to use the Concierge safe was impractical. The CM said they did have another room; come down to the desk. We did &amp; Wa-lah, Saleem had us in another room (#1119) in a New York minute. We get to our new room; again double beds, slightly larger with a view of the city, a fridge &amp; a safe that worked. We discovered the TV did not work. We called &amp; in 5 minutes a maintenance rep showed up &amp; fixed the problem in a jiffy; back plug was out of the set. Each day our room was cleaned &amp; all our questions were answered by the staff. They were all polite to us. I needed to print some itinerary stuff &amp; they promptly directed us to the Business Center. We'd leave our room and the housekeepers were all smiles and wished a good day.The one draw back is the new elevator system; you enter your floor on a keypad &amp; it assigns an elevator. One problem, it doesn't ask the # in your party, so as folks arrive to the elevators, everyone is assigned the same one. You'd have 20 folks to one elevator which doesn't work out well. We had one overloaded and it ground it's way to the lobby. They are still working the kinks on this. As we reached the lobby one morning, there were some suits standing &amp; chatting; turns out the elevator company.Having experience in Risk Management I later contacted the hotel on my return home and spoke to the manager who works with the elevator service. I identified some flaws in the system; that while it was great to push your floor and be assigned a particular car, everyone was being assigned the same car, out of 4 elevators. Additionally, the same keypad is out in the front lobby, allowing bored kids to push buttons, or adults to push their floor, but then be side tracked and not use the elevator. Once a floor is picked on the keypad, it automatically lights up the button in the elevator. So, if many folks don't show up, the remaining passengers are left to stop on floors where no one is getting off.Since the system doesn't ask for # of passengers in your group, the Hotel is overloading the elevator. From a Risk Management point of view, were they prepared to be sued when one elevator, being overweight, snaps free or just shuts down trapping folks. You could hear a pin drop. The rep actually heard what I said, took notes and asked if it was okay to contact me for follow up questions or thoughts. Hey, sure, why not.The Park Central is not the Ritz Carlton, which I have stayed in other cities, even here in SF, and was not impressed. Now, the InterContinental impresses me anytime. But anyway, The Park Central is and older hotel, but I found it clean, remodeled on our floors, the Business Center, Gym area and others. The lobby was nice and truly everyone was pleasant to us and accommodated us quickly.Don't eat at the hotel restaurant; THE LINE IS JUST TOO LONG FOR AVERAGE FOOD. Go over to the Brooklyn Diner or Europa down the block, great food and good prices.Another tip I tell all; TIP YOUR HOUSEKEEPER DAILY. Don't assume you have the same housekeeper each day. Many folks tip the last day or when they pay. You're assuming the HK getting all the tip on the last day will share or even if that HK was the one that cleaned your room all week. Plus you assume the Hotel will pass the money along to housekeeping. I was given this tip years ago and it has resulted in; returning in the evening with the bed turned down and chocolates on my pillow, larger towels, a bath robe, better toiletries, extra blanket, flowers on the table, and my belongings always stayed put. I even once found my dirty clothes laundered.This trip, we tipped each day, and we'd return to Thank You notes, wishing us well, thanking us for our generosity &amp; with God Bless, and we got newer larger bath towels (though not necessary as we opted for the clean choice; same linens for stay to reduce water use) These folks don't get paid well and they do a lot, so return the favor and ensure your HK get's their tip.All in all, it was a nice stay at the Park Central. I would recommend it as it's close to everything, clean, polite staff, etc."
196,1889,"Jan 1 2009 	Just what we wanted	We stayed here for a christmas romantic break. We got a great deal on Opodo.The hotel was great, location was AMAZING and any problems we had were sorted immediately. Our key was stopped on the last day (seems like that happens a lot) but when we got locked out we just called security from the free phone in the hall and they came up straight away.Also our toilet blocked on the first day and they sorted it within 20 minutes.The elevators were really quick, we never waited more than 1 minute (there were more elevators the other side of the lobby which we used so maybe other people havnt realised this!)Getting there from the aiport was so easy and cost $7 (drops you almost on the corner of the hotel) simply get the AIR TRAIN to jamaica and then the E train to 53rd street and you are oretty much outside. Its so much cheaper than a taxi and not much longer when its so busy.I definately recommend this hotel. Its nothing grand or fancy but its comfy, warm, beautiful lobby and excellent location."
197,1889,"Dec 29 2008 	disappointed	I was able to book only one night at this hotel and that was enough for me. Luckily I got a special rate (half off) on the price of $280 but I was disappointed with my stay and would never have paid full price. We went to NYC to see the Xmas decorations and this hotel seemed to be a good deal because breakfast was included free of charge. However, it's a few blocks away from Times Square but only 3 blocks from Central Park. The hotel lobby was pretty and spacious but there was always a long line at the front desk. The clerk did mention that we needed to use the machines around the lobby to find which elevator to get on to our floor. The hotel room was okay but seemed shabby. There was no frig, no microwave, no extra blankets and only 2 tiny bottles of shampoo &amp; lotion. We only had 3 bath towels between the 2 of us and no washcloth or handtowel. The bed was comfortable though, there were extra fluffy pillows, and an alarm clock. We woke up the next morning to the fire alarm blaring and 5 firetrucks pulling up in front of the hotel (false alarm).The breakfast was in their cafe and had a variety of food but they &quot;accidentially&quot; charged me for my breakfast because they had a &quot;glitch&quot; in their computer. Their buffet breakfast charge was $61 for 2 people! Unbelievable! They then wanted to charge me $5 to print out my reservation on their computer as my proof of the free breakfast. I refused and they were able to &quot;waive&quot; the charge. I usually don't check out because of the lines at the front desk but this time I did via the phone and went down to the desk to get my receipt and there was the charge for breakfast again! I finally had to speak to management to get the charge reversed. So here's hoping that charge doesn't just magically appear again on my credit card. I would definitely recommend checking your bill before leaving.I realize that this hotel is in the heart of the city but for the price, this hotel was nothing special."
198,1889,"Dec 28 2008 	Good Value 	The price was reasonable for NYC and prime location. The room was comfortable and well equipped. We were disappointed because support services were overwhelmed by the guests. The 'free' breakfast is a big draw but the wait for dining is 30 minutes or more in a line snaking thru the lobby. The restaurant serves about 60 people but there are 945 rooms in the hotel!!! The elevators wait to get up to your room is fine. But, coming down the wait for an elevator is at least 10 minutes and often 15-20 minutes. Several packed elevators stop, but there is no room for more guests. We walked down 15 flights several times. We were also annoyed to pay for bag storage on the day we checked out. The hotel provides voucher for early check-ins but not on checkout days."
199,1889,"Dec 24 2008	Avoid at all costs!	I've stayed at much better quality hotels than Park Central, and paid less. A cold, dark room with a continuous draught coming through the window made it unbearable to sleep on that side of the bed. The hotel is clearly unable to cope with the amount of people staying there. Our first morning we foolishly queued for an hour for breakfast only to find food had run out and orange juice was watered down. Real bargain for $30 each, eh?The restaurant needs to be quadruple its current size to cope with demand. There was a battered old hoover left outside our door for the duration of the stay; ironic considering the room had clearly not been shown a hoover or a duster for some time. I wrote my name in the dust on the tv screen. In the city that never sleeps, room service finishes at 10pm at Park Central. On the plus side, great cardio-vascular workout every day rather than endure the 15 minute wait for the lift. Blocked toilet and lights that worked intermittently. Don't be fooled by the flash lobby area. Dire."
200,1889,"Dec 23 2008 	First Class	My Dad booked us to stay at the park central hotel over the weekend of 28th November for my 18th Birthday. We arrived to what appeared to be a very classy hotel in a superb location right next to central park and we were not let down by what we found inside either. The foyer looked beautiful with all the festive decorations and the staff on the door were very welcoming. We arrived rather early because of the flight timings but this was not a problem as the lady on reception was happy to check us in. I must say unfortunately i cannot remember the name of the lady on reception that helped us with our check in but she was extremely helpful throughout our stay. We were given a choice of rooms which was excellent as the first room that we were shown was not exactly what we wanted (it was our first time to the big apple so we wanted a good view out the window) and the receptionist was more than happy to give us another room higher up which was a superb room! It meant waiting a little bit of waiting around for the room to be cleaned but we were more than happy to shop for a few hours :) Overall the hotel was very accomodating and we really enjoyed our stay, thankyou to all of the staff that made my birthday weekend very special! tourist information was also very helpful to us as we were new to the subway."
201,1889,"Dec 19 2008 	Great location could use an upgrade	Booked here through Priceline. Hotel is dated, yet functional. Great location with easy access to Central Park and midtown Manhattan. Room was large enough. Could have used an update in furnishings. Typical older NYC hotel. Would stay here again as long as the price is right."
202,1889,"Dec 16 2008 	You Would Be Surprised	For a very good hotel in New York City during the pre-Christmas week, this was a really great deal. I booked this through Hot Wire and was concerned when I read some less than great reviews, but got inside info from my brother who said he had stayed there before and it was fine.After hoofing the 20 blocks up 7th Avenue in Christmas gawker pedestrian traffic and near freezing weather, I was happy just to get inside. The lobby was splendid by most NYC hotel standards and check in for a prepaid room was fast and the reception cordial. I took the elevator up to the 25th floor after having to get out of the car and find the code that allows you to pick your floor and then an assigned car. No big deal, but reception missed telling me about this. I encountered other mystified travelers who had the same problem.As I put my key into the door, I heard a woman's voice inside the room sasy: &quot;Who's dat?&quot;I said: &quot;the guest assigned to this room,&quot; and went in to find two maids goofing off in the easy chairs. They said they were &quot;just finishing up the room,&quot; but they clearly didn't expect me.The rest of the 2 night stay went fine. The room was as good or better than ones I have found in major chain hotels at three times the Hotwire price. Flatscreen TV, coffee maker, nice king bed with linens that fit, plenty of new towels, marble top on bathroom sink, clean, new shower curtain, plenty of hot water and not a bad view either. The key here is that at $109 a night, plus tax and fees, the hotel is in a great location: a few blocks from Central Park and 59th Street, reasonable walk to Grand Central and Penn Station, plenty of nearby delis and restaurants and overall, a great place to stay. Great deal if you can get it.I would love to stay there again, but I'll bet I don't find this rate again!"
203,1889,"Dec 9 2008 	Second stay at the Park Central!	Second time ok! Had our adjoining rooms as requested. House keeping needs some serious help....dirty glasses remained in room until we took them out ourselves....found some items behind the dresser...you could see when going from room to room....that no one should have had to see....again....house keeping! But none the less....a great place to stay. Location is just above the N, Q , R, W line....making it very easy to get around.....staff always gracious and friendly.....baggage check no problem $1.50 per bag....not bad if you have to pay! Would stay again...but would prefer housekeeping doing a better job!"
204,1889,"Dec 9 2008 	Not a bad place for the money	Found this hotel through Hotel Club and got a great price per night....$161. The room was clean and good sized for NYC. The staff was helpful on check in, but not so helpful the next morning. They do run their desk staff ragged which I think is the reason for the snippy attitude that morning. The bed was comfortable, but the heating/AC unit was terrible. The room was too hot and I couldn't get the cool air to work to cool it down. Made sleeping a bit difficult in such a hot room. Loved the flat screen TV. I would recommend avoiding the lounge as drink prices are outrageous! $14 for a cocktail is just a bit too pricey for my liking. The smell when entering the lobby is a bit offensive, not even sure what the smell was. I would stay here again."
205,1889,"Dec 9 2008 	Park Central Nice Stay	The Park Central is a nice place to stay. I just returned from a girls weekend trip.The location is great, the staff was very friendly,we had no problems.The rooms were a little small but from what I hear this is normal in NYC.Location is walking distance to all major attractions."
206,1889,"Dec 8 2008	Park Central in Easter - a great stay	Although this review is about the accommodation where we stayed around a year and a half ago, this was my second time to New York, and this was a great place to stay.We stayed for five nights, wanted to do the majority of the sights, and planned to do this mostly by foot (with the occasional subway journey uptown/downtown if it was a lengthy distance away). So we wanted somewhere comfortable, high quality and located near the good sights - Park Central was perfect.Lovely bed and bathroom, great TV and all the facilities we needed (as we were only really using the room to sleep in!). Would highly recommend this hotel if your looking for a safe and secure place to stay, that's clean and well-maintained. It is a bit pricey, but probably about average amongst some of the other places (especially with the great location to Fifth Ave, Central Park a stones throw away, and Times Square where food, bars and shops are the best).Big thumbs up, especially for young couples."
207,1889,"Dec 1 2008 	Dust Mites?	I stayed at the Park Central for nearly a week on business. I booked the room at a fairly good discount directly from the hotel website and I wasn't expecting anything fancy, just a decent place to sleep. I had a rather bad experience:First off, I needed to extend my stay an extra night and when I asked about the possibility, the front desk staff was rude and said that there was absolutely no availability. However, upon checking the HOTEL'S OWN WEBSITE, it appeared there were many rooms available. I booked directly online and then went back to the front desk with the reservation and asked to keep the same room. They did not apologize for the mistake and it took a long 10 minutes of persuasion just to be able to keep the same room. Clearly, this hotel has some major organizational and service problems.Secondly, the power went out during the last day of my stay and the staff was quite rude and unhelpful about resolving or explaining the problem. They were strict on check out times despite the fact that it was impossible to see or take a hot shower.Finally, I have never been allergic to anything but after staying a few nights in this hotel, I had to go the emergency room because of a severe allergic reaction caused by something I came in contact with in this hotel, the doctor said it was most likely dust mites. I called the hotel and asked for explanation and once again they were rude and unhelpful, someone just transferred me to security. I called back many times with no resolve; it was clear that this hotel has too many organizational problems to be of good service to its guests.I would not reccommend this hotel."

The rooms were terribel, they were dirty, and the bathrooms even more. The bathrooms, hade lots of stains, nailclippings (disgusting) and mold shower curtains. Beyons that lots of dust, and i believe they last vaccumed the room about 3 months ago.The managemnet and the reception employees, were extremely impolite. Not willing to provide any service, and they were very arogant. In addition to this, the lobby was teribly busy, wioth l;ots of people, not belonging there. There was no security and no-one seems to care about safety of any other guest related issues.The elevators, were througout the whole week in maintance, therfore there were very long waits (upto 15 minutes).We will never go back to this hotel! The only nice thing about this hotel, is the location, as it is 2 blocks away from the park, and near timessquare!"

Elevators - always a problem in this hotel. you can wait for like 8-10 minutes for an elevator if you are in one of the top floors5. room was just too dark (maybe few lamps were missing)
211,1889,"Nov 21 2008 	Our home in NYC!!!	It was my first time to NY and Park Central Hotel was a truly home sweet home during my stay in Big Apple from 2-13 October 2008. In overall, this hotel is exceeding my expectation. Later I found out that Singaporean Airlines crews also stay in this hotel regularly, so I guess this hotel provide a high service quality amongst so many hotels in NY. Location:On 8th Ave, W 58th St, this hotel is close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, Carnegie Hall (within walking distance) and the subway station on 57th St is just at the hotel corner. The surrounding area of the hotel is safe, bright and rather crowded till late, but I never hear any noise from the street once I was in my room. There are 24 hours cheap delis near hotel and some nice restaurants along the street. I even walked to Times Square at 42nd St. from hotel. It was fun, easy walk and so many things to see along the way. Many yellow cabs stand by in front of hotels or just waves the ones passing by. Booking and check-in:We booked the hotel via its own website and get affordable rate at USD 300 (incl. tax) per night. I was worried whether such rate worth the room and service, as I read mix reviews about the hotel on tripadvisor. But once we entered our room and during our stay, I think that rate was a really good deal and worth every cents of it. Check-in process is quick and no hassle at all. I initially booked superior king room, but when we arrived there, my friend asked whether we could have twin queen-sized bed room. The front desk said No problem politely, and we got twin queen-sized bed room without any additional charges (even though later I read on the website, that the double bed room rate is higher than superior king). The rate was not incl. breakfast, but who need a pricey breakfast at hotel when you can buy coffee and bread at nearby delis or Starbuck with cheaper price?.Room:We were very happy to get the twin queen-sized bed room, because the room was more spacious (I think for NY standard, our room at that rate was indeed spacious, or could I say HUGE!!! I didnt even believe it the first time I saw it). Bathroom was standard size, but not cramped at all, and as bonus, we got a shower bathtub!!! It was clean, taps and shower functioned well, incl. hot and cold and water pressure. I was so relieved and felt so lucky to have our room. Beds were quite pleasant. Sheets were OK, eventhough I suspected that it was not changed daily. But yeah, it was fine for us. Off course, there were minor downside. First, our window faced a brick wall of the hotels other wing. Second, the mobile phone reception in our room or at least in all rooms on the same area as ours was poor (maybe the signal was blocked by the hotels inside walls). Third, as has been complained by other travellers, the air-con. It worked, but not really give you fresh cold like normal air-con and we can not adjust the temperature. But since we were there on autumn, it still alright with the air-con, as the temperature outside was quite cold and windy. Im sure air-con would be an issue if you stay here during summer. However, we both are easy-to-be-pleased fellas and we just did not want to ruin our NYC trip by a few minor things about hotel, regarding that we only stay in the room for sleeping and get shower. Staff:In overall, staff were courteous, polite, helpful, although not as friendly as hotel staff in Asia, for example. This is NYC, and were OK with it. We had some problem when extending our stay for another night, as the front desk mistakenly put 9 nights on their database instead of 10 nights, so she said that we have to pay for another 2 nights instead one, while in our booking confirmation it was clearly stated that we already paid for 10 nights (2-12 October and we want to have another night extension). We were then assisted by another hotel staff (I think she is the supervisor of those front desk staff) who help us with our problem and it was resolved within a few minutes. She (beautiful American-Lithuanian lady named Lina) became our friend during our stay in the hotel. Thanks, Lina!Facilities:Beside the restaurant that we did not try during our stay, the hotel also has a decent-size gym with decent equipment and open 24 hours. They have fleet of hired cars and we used it to go to JFK at USD 70 one way. I did not know exactly, but the car we hired was kinda like Toyota Harrier or similar and it was very comfortable. Another downside was the handling fee of USD 3.50 that charged to us when we pick up our ordered books from amazon.com delivered to the hotel. I can understand if they charged us for luggage deposits (at USD 3.75 per bag/luggage), but handling fee for package? What type of handling work they did? We picked up ourselves to concierge instead of having our books delivered to our room. Elevators:Having read about the complaints from other travellers about the elevators, we were kind of worry also at first. But during our stay, the lift worked fine and we never wait too long for elevators. But yes, on our last day, there was a maintenance on 2 of their elevators (prior notification was sent to us couple days before) so on that day, we and other guests have to wait longer than usual. But to be fair, we stayed during low season (hotel might not as crowded as holiday season), so we can say we did not have problem with elevators during our stay.We are very happy with Park Central Hotel, they made our trip to NY so fantastic! NYC itself is so amazing, but our pleasant stay in this hotel truly doubled our excitement. Nothings perfect, but if you want to get hotel that has spacious room, good location, helpful staff with affordable rate, I really recommend this hotel. Reading some negative reviews for this hotel, I think I was lucky not to get through such experience, or am I just easy to be pleased? Come on, people, if you want treatment like royals, go for 5 stars hotels and pay more! I definitely return to this hotel for my next trip to the city that never sleep!!!Tips:Do use subway! Its easy and cheap (especially the weekly pass at USD 25) and take you anywhere quick,. We never used taxi, except from JFK to Manhattan when we arrived. Yes, we did used hotels car for practicality because we have 4 luggages with us and we want everything be ready at our desired time."
212,1889,"Nov 21 2008 	Amazing!	I stayed at the Park Central hotel in New York for 5 Nights and loved every second of it. The hotel was incredible...No faults what so ever! The staff were very polite and always willing to help. As for the location well...it was seconds away from Central Park, Times Square &amp; Broadway. Overall, I had the best time of my life and was devasted to be leaving. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
213,1889,"Nov 16 2008 	Great Hotel	I am quite shocked at many of the negative reviews. This is a great hotel - great price, prime location, and large rooms. Our rooms were very clean and huge. Its rare to find NY hotels with large rooms. The rates are incredibly low. The hotel is quite. This is an above average NY hotel. This hotel's room are bigger than some of the NY 5 star hotels. We checked in early both times. Our first stay we left our bags without charge and second stay checked out late- 3pm! No additional charge. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel. In fact, we loved the hotel so much after our first stay the week of October 20th that we returned."
214,1889,"Nov 10 2008 	Bring your own light bulbs	Stayed for two nights and couldn't wait to check out. The first room I got had mold in the bathroom, torn wall paper, broken flickering bathroom lights, only a sheer curtain covering the window so the people in the building across from me were in plain view (and I assume they could see me too), and was very noisy due to the street. After numerous complaints was finally given another room. Within minutes of being re-assigned a room another very embarrassed couple walked into my room as I was packing to move to the next room. The hotel could not give me 3 minutes to pack my bags? The next room had stains on the walls and was so dark I could barely see (bring your own lamp if you need to apply make-up for a night on the town). After talking to other guests I learned that all the rooms are quite dark. There was no cell phone reception so used the hotel phone to make a 4 minute call home and was charged $10. Was awoken in the middle of the night by vacuuming in the hall."
215,1889,"Nov 10 2008 	Fix the elevators!	We have stayed here before, because nearby hotels with the same type of comfortable rooms cost a lot more. The location is terrific. But the elevators are a chronic problem and have gotten worse. This weekend, only one or sometimes two of the elevators were working. During the morning &quot;rush,&quot; an elevator took many minutes to come at all. It was stopping, full, at every floor, where exasperated people stood with luggage and nowhere to go. The only real way to get down was to use the service elevators, and streams of people did that. The management had posted no signs about the service outage, no apologies, no explanations, no nothing. My advice: Stay here -- the price is right -- but if you need to use the elevators from 7-10 a.m., scout out the service elevators."
216,1889,"Nov 8 2008	Nice Location So-So Service	This hotel is in a great location and you pay for it. It is between Central Park and Times Square. The room was &quot;okay&quot; but nothing special as the attached photos will show. The breakfast was disappointing and expensive. Find a nearby restaurant for better value. There was a verrrryyyy long wait for the elevators. I was attending a conference at the hotel. At the end of one of the days I returned to the room at 4:00pm to find the room not made up. I called the front desk and was assured it would be taken care of immediately. I left to find a place to read for an hour and when I returned at 5:00pm the room was still not cleaned. I called the front desk and was told it was not cleaned because the &quot;shift was changing.&quot; The hotel management should remind staff that the customer doesn't know or care that &quot;the shift is changing.&quot; For the high price paid a clean room should be provided when a guest returns to it and especially when a guest is inconvenienced. On the night of 11/5 there was a fire on the 4th floor of the hotel. A loudspeaker told guests to stay in their rooms. Well, after 9/11, not too many people were ready to stay in their rooms knowing a fire was on a floor below them. The hotel staff did little to deal with the situation that I could see. There is nothing special about this property except the location. If you are willing and able to pay for that, this hotel will meet your needs but nothing more."
217,1889,"Nov 1 2008 	Great fun in amazing NYC	we stayed at hotel park central for 8 nights with our two teenage daughters. we booked a 'superior double double' sleeps four. what we recieved was a dark, small and narrow room with two queen size beds. not even the kids fitted the beds, parents slept almost beside the bed... food was not tested, because of nearby delis, which were excellent. elevators were like snails: we had to wait for 15 mins for the only elevator which worked out of four. heating worked only if the house keeping decided doing so. employees at front desk were very friendly and kind even if workload was big. the location of the hotel is superb, several steps from times sq, moma, 5th ave or from central park. door keepers are also very kind to aid in transfer to jfk. internet was only available in the room but with extremely low bps rate for 14 dollars per day. bathroom was dark and old fashioned. water came in the shower very slow, toilet must have been pumped several times. one small bottle of shower gel was offered every day for 4 persons. absolutely no fun for teenage kids in the hotel building. nice fitness room available. hotel lobby is elegant, building old fashioned but nice, cleaning and maintanance could be better. all employees were very friendly. overall opinion: price for value is poor (price is for new york average)"
218,1889,"Oct 31 2008	Excellent hotel some of the front desk staff should be politer	We booked our room for six nights. Upon our arrival, we were told the hotel was booked out, and were assigned a higher category room (355) with no charge. The following day, we were put up in an excellent one (2512). However, due to the heavy rain in NYC three days after, we had two leaks in the room, which prevented us from sleeping there and we were relocated. On that occasion, in room 1833.Staff was very sympathetic and helped us a lot. The biggest and most outrageous situation, after all this ordeal was the moment we checked out. I literally strove to explain to the receptionist (code number '17') what happened over our stay with a view at making sure that no extra charges would be made to us. To our surprise, she told me she did not want to hear about it, handed me the bill for revision. No thanks, no nothing after paying almost $2000.I know this is just a bad attitude from one person, but needless to say that, sometimes, the last impression is what counts and this, unfortunately, may make all the hotel good souvenirs fade away.I leave up to the readers to judge by themselves what happened to us."
219,1889,"Oct 29 2008 	So-So	The lobby was very nice. The people were, for the most part, pretty nice. The actual room, left a little to be desired. The bathroom was pretty gross. Mold in the shower. We had no air conditioning and the room was very hot and musty. There were several switch plates and electrical outlets that were either broken or did not work at all. The food in the restaraunt was not good at all!Pop machine was broken on our floor."
220,1889,"Oct 27 2008 	Dont stay here	this was my second time staying at the park central. I went to check in and was told check in is at 4 pm. I offered to pay more and they said there was nothing available. ok. i understand, i was given a ticket to check my bags. I then found out i have to pay!!! what hotel do you have to pay to check your bags?! I chose to hold on to my computer, as that was an extra bag and asked for a password for wifi. Nope, there is no wifi available, you can only use their computers in the business room. As for the rooms itself they are bland, need to be updated, and a little dirty in appearance. DONT STAY here. there are many other GOOD hotels in nyc that offer good customer service and are much better."
221,1889,"Oct 25 2008 	Loved the Park Central!! Can't understand the negative reviews.	We were slightly apprehensive on the way to the hotel due to some negative reviews we had read. However, when we arrived the hotel lobby was superb and we were really plesantly surprised. We had virtually no queue to check in. The first room we had had two queen beds and we had reserved a superior king room. My only slight criticism was the lady on the phone when we rang to question this was slightly rude and said that they didn't have any available but they would try to move us in the morning. I suspected that this may not be the case and on our way out called down to reception and managed to speak to a lady called Drita Oroshi who was absolutely brilliant, she was very polite and helpful, moved us straight away to a much better room with the king bed we wanted. The rooms were very clean and very spacious. Super base for anyone going like we were to expore the sights and sounds of New York and we would definately recommend it to anyone."
222,1889,"Oct 24 2008 	Great hotel	I stayed in this hotel with 2 other friends for a girly week of sight seeing, eating &amp; drinking. The hotel suprised us when we got there as we got a great deal on the room so we weren't expecting the &quot;ritz&quot;. The first impression was great. We couldn't check in straight away so we went into the bar. We were met by an incredibly friendly Irish barman who was from our neck of the woods. He gave us few tips on travelling around the city and what to see.When checked in, we found the room (2double beds) to be spacious and clean. The hotel is in great location, not too busy/noisy yet close enough by foot to see great attractions - especially Central Park.We had one issue with the room that was dealt with immediatly and with great efficiency. I didn't have too much dealings with the hotel staff other than checking in/out but they were friendly enough - they did their job!!There's nice places to eat close to the hotel (the restaurant in hotel is slightly expensive), and subway is only short walk away."
223,1889,"Oct 22 2008 	Great hotel	We just returned from a 3 day stay this last weekend. We were more than thrilled with this hotel. The room was very nice and the staff were very cordial. We stood in line for check-in for about 3 minutes, no kidding. The room was recentaly remodeled. The windows did keep out the noise and the A/C worked very well, yes in Oct. Housekeeping did a great job and had the room made up by 10:00 every morning. The only complaint I had was the overpriced hotel bar. Don't go there, there are lots of bars within a block. The location is a great plus."
224,1889,"Oct 22 2008 	Solid hotel on a budget--will use again	I recently stayed at the Park Central Hotel for 5 nights and overall was very pleased with it. It is an older hotel and could use some cosmetic work but other than that had no major complaints. I was on the 16th floor in a corner room (1621) with two double beds. The room was average sized and the bathroom was quite small, but everything was clean (and no bugs of any description). The wallpaper was a bit tired and the bathroom sink was cracked but apart from that the room was in good repair. I had read the reports of slow elevators so was braced for the worst but apart from one morning around 10 a.m. when we had to wait about 3 minutes for an elevator, we did not wait more than 30 seconds. The staff was friendly and helpful. This is not a &quot;honeymoon hotel&quot; nor a luxury property. The real draw of Park Central is its fantastic location. It is situated diagonally across from Carnegie Hall on Seventh Ave, a 10-15 minute walk from 5th Ave., Central Park, Times Square, and Restaurant Row. It is almost impossible to find a hotel as centrally located for under $400 per night.I would note that the hotel bar is nothing special and quite overpriced. We did not eat at the restaurant nor did we get to go to the Russian Tea Room which is steps away. We did have breakfast at the Carnegie Deli. I had the largest omelet I've ever seen and my friend had a bagel which came with what amounted to half a package of cream cheese. We also had breakfast at the Park Cafe, which was very good and less expensive (but smaller portions) and Fluffy's (the cheapest option, with plastic cutlery and paper plates). We had dinner one night at Molyvos, a Greek restaurant across the street, but I would not recommend it. The food was vastly overpriced and the portions were small and just not that good."
225,1889,"Oct 20 2008 	Overpriced - Rude Front Desk Staff	I stayed here for 2 nights in September on business. When I checked in at the front desk, I specifically reminded the clerk-who lacked any form of personality- that I did not want a room by the elevators (due to noise from people getting on / off.) When I got to my room, I was directly across from the elevator! I called down to the front desk, and they said there were no more rooms of my type (King Bed) available. I selected the concierge rate for $50 more per night as I thought there would be some sort of evening snack / morning breakfast. I called the front desk again to inquire, and was told there was no lounge. When I asked what was included in the concierge rate, they said I would be able to have a free breakfast in the restaurant at the hotel. Well, the breakfast buffet (included eggs, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, bacon, etc.), was only $18. Therefore, they completely overcharged for the &quot;concierge&quot; aspect of the room! I agree with others that it is in a decent location, but I will never stay here again due to feeling like I was completely ripped off."
226,1889,"Oct 17 2008 	bad service and unpleasant stay	Unfortunately we cannot recomand this hotel, mainly because of the poor service and attitude we got there. We booked the hotel in the hotel`s website for two adults and a 1 year old baby. Going through the booking process you are specifically asked to write down the age of the child, which we did and also we asked for a crib in the section of &quot;special request&quot;. We also got confirmation on our reservation. To our surprise - when we got to the hotel we were asked to pay an extra of 40$ per night in order to get the crib (and just so you`ll know - we paid around 340$ per night). Nothing helped even though it was a mistake of the hotel and the only ansewr we got was: &quot;This is New York, what do you expect?&quot; Well - we certainly expected more and the questin is what did this hotel expected when we booked a room for two adults and a baby?!! . When we got to the room we realized that even though we book a lux. king room - it was too small for a couple with a baby and anyhow there was no room for a crib even if we would have paid thode exstra 40$ per night, so our baby slept in our bed. Of course this wasn`t very convinient. Other than that - the hotel has a good location if you want to be in the most touristic area (just 5 min. walk to Time Squre an to Centrl Park), thogh after spending some time in NY we think that this is not the best location if what you have in mind is an area with good restuarants. in the area of the hotel you can mostly get diners and self-service restaurants. A nice restaurant two blocks from the Hotel is Maison`s - a good brassary with good food and reasonable prices. The next surprise was during check-out when we were asked to pay 3.75$ per each item we wanted to leave at the hotel during the day. Never in our life we were asked to pay anything for leaving our laugage at the hotel after check out. Our impression was that this hotel does not welcome its guest and from that reason only we won`t be staying again at this hotel."
227,1889,"Oct 15 2008	Park Central Hotel - stay away!	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights this month, and had to change rooms twice! There were cochroaches in one room, mold in the next and the staff were not friendly, only one person named George. We would never recommend this hotel and won't be returning."
228,1889,"Oct 8 2008 	Getting a bit tired of this tired looking hotel	I recently stayed at the Park Central on business. This is probably my 5th and last stay at the hotel. Although its location is very good the hotel is starting to feel its age and I think this is true of the staff also. It's always been a good port of call for me in New York as it's easy for me to find my bearings from there however I think It's time to try somewhere else.Check in is always a problem. You either have to join a lengthy queue or, if there is no queue, the receptionist goes walkabout so you still end up queuing. This is not an exaggeration, 5 check-ins and I've never experienced anything else.The reception, bar and restaurant areas are all quite nicely laid out which only serves as a disappointment when you find your room. Leaky ceilings in the bathroom are not uncommon and the decor and furnishings are tired. The windows don't keep out any noise or draughts whatsoever. The internet connection needs a bit of DIY to get it working (basically disconnect the modem glued to the table and plug your laptop straight into the wall socket) and at $15 a night for connection it's pretty pricey compared with other hotels. The bar in the hotel is also quite pricey. More than one customer complained about their bill in the space of one hour when I was there. Across the street past the Wellington and the Deli is an Irish Bar (conveniently called 'Irish Bar'). This is always a friendly place, it's pretty small and plays a good cross section of music. For snacks on the go there's the 55th street deli, to sit down I'd recommend the deli directly opposite called Benash. There's also the famous Carnegie Deli (next to the 55th street deli) which has signed photos of loads of famous people (presidents etc) on its walls. How this place got its reputation I don't know as the food was nothing special although the portions were extremely large.All in all, the hotel's in a good location and if you just use it as a base and don't expect a high level of comfort then it's ideal although there are cheaper hotels of similar standard in the area."
229,1889,"Oct 8 2008 	Good hotel good location	My wife and I stayed here early Oct 08 for four nights. As has already been stated its in a good location if you want to be in a touristy location close to Times Square and Central Park and on top of a tube stop for connections to lower Manhattan. It was one of the more reasonably priced (in NY anyway!) hotels we found and for our money we got a good sized room, which was clean, quiet and comfortable. All the lifts worked and the only complaint I had was that there was no way of controlling the room temp. However, if this hotel is in your budget I would recommend it - trust me you wont see much of it!"
230,1889,"Oct 7 2008 	Great Hotel with Great Location	My husband and i went to NYC for our anniversary Aug 21-26th and stayed at the park central. What a great hotel. 1st of all if you are going to NYC to relax think again. . We were in our room to sleep and thats about it. The beds were great. Nice and firm we stayed in a standard room. RM 1404. and we were very pleased. It was very clean, no mold like i read in some reviews. It did have a slight smokey smell (even though we were in a non smoking room) but nothing overbearing. We never at at the hotel. Cafe Metro one block north or south is a GREAT breakfast place. The location of this hotel is what makes it FABULOUS! exit the hotel and go left.... there is central park . Exit the hotel and go right there is times square. The subway is right infront as well. for the price you couldnt beat the park central. If and when we return to NYC we will most likely go back unless we stay in a different part of town. the front desk was very helpful and the concierge helped us with reservations. the only downfall is that sometimes you had to wait 10-15 to be able to speak to them. all in all it was a great resting pleace when you finally did rest, in the city that never sleeps. oh and a good tip.... we booked through the hotel since they say they offer the lowest price guarenteed. we didnt find a lower price through anyone else.... and i looked hard."
231,1889,"Oct 5 2008 	Served it's purpose	As it was our first time in New York, we wanted to stay somewhere central to all the happenings, yet not too pricey. Park Central IS in a great location of Manhattan. A few blocks from all the great attractions. The accommodations, however, were similar to a $100-$150/night hotel in a &quot;regular&quot; city. The room had NO thermostat adjustment. In fact, when we were a little too chilly for comfort, the hotel staff advised us that &quot;in the City of New York, we cannot activate our heating system until it is 40 degress outside&quot;. HUH? They, instead, provided one extra flannel blanket...One of the bedside light fixtures was permanently broken- which was a bit of a nuisance.At one point, the hot water in the entire hotel did not work, but they promptly remedied the situation (took a few hours).The towels were SCRATCHY and cheap. And the bed linens were no more than 80count. We spent most of our time &quot;in the streets&quot; of New York, and really only used the room to &quot;crash&quot;. All in all, it served it's purpose, but for the money, we expected a few niceties to come standard (working fixtures, better towels &amp; sheets)... We'll stay somewhere else next time."
232,1889,"Sep 30 2008 	Lovely hotel	We stayed in the park central for one week in early september and were happy with our choice of hotel. The hotel was recommended by a friend who had been there a few weeks earkly. I was quite worried as we had seen some bad reviews, and although it was my first time in New york, i certainly dont have low standards in the type of hotel i stay in so we were satisfied with the park central hotel. We did pay a high enough price for staying a week, but we had looked around a bit and most others seemed to be along the same price and i would have rathered stay somewhere a friend had recommended and get somewhere decent. When we arrived we checked in no problem. The original room we were put in was slightly cramped but nicely furnished and most importantly it was clean. There was a slight glitch as the air conditioning was broken, but we phoned the front desk and they immediately gave us the room next door, which was a lot more spacious but had the same amount of furniture in it, just a different layout. Both the rooms and bathrooms were clean and we never had any problems with how the housekeeping was done.The only problem we encountered during our stay was with they key card for the room. On 3 seperate occasions they key stopped working. The second time it happened i was advised this was because of the fact that i kept it in the same bag as my cell phone and credit card, which i found hard to believe considering most people staying in NYC are going to be carrying either both or one or the other, and also this had never happened in any other hotel ive stayed in! Also, on the third occasion it stopped working we had kept the key in the bottom of a suitcase while we went on an overnight trip, so it hadnt been near either a phone or a credit card!Apart from this minor problem i would certainly recommend the hotel. From other reviews maybe it is a bit hit and miss, but if you are on a sightseeing holiday (i have no idea for business trips!) i think its a great place to stay. The hotel is 2 mins from central park and a 5 min walk from times square. Its just off broadway and there is a subway station right beside it. We found the staff very friendly and helpful, especially for organising tickets to places and tours. I would definitely stay again!"
233,1889,"Sep 26 2008 	Good location	We stayed here for a business trip at the end of August 2008. The hotel is extremely well located for Central Park, Times Square and all the midtown attractions. Loads of restaurants nearby, plus health food shops, all night pharmacies and tourist tat.There is plenty of space out front for the cabs to pull in. I didn't see any porters to help you with your bags the whole time I was there, so be prepared to carry them yourself.The lobby is large, but it needed to be as it was heaving with people the whole time, both independent travellers and big tour groups. Check-in was straighforward, if a bit lengthy - the staff seemed to be on a go-slow, but they were reasonably friendly for a New York hotel. My colleagues got standard rooms, which were fine - not huge, but also not a bad size for central NY. I arrived quite late due to delayed flights, and got upgraded to a suite, which was positively palatial. There were 3 rooms: a sitting room with sofas, and plasma screen, plus fridge, coffee machine and microwave. Then an internal lobby with writing desk, leading to the enormous bedroom, with windows on 2 sides, and marvellous views of the surrounding skyscrapers. Another TV in here for watching in bed. Finally, the bathroom, which was really very nice. It obviously wasn't especially new, but it was in excellent condition, with clean grouting, nice marble surfaces, and a big bathtub / shower over, with plenty of fluffy towels. The aircon worked well - I blasted it during the day to keep the room cool, then turned it down at night as it was quite noisy. The windows were double glazed, and kept out almost all the traffic noise - you would never know you were in central NY, it's the first hotel in NY I've ever slept in and not needed earplugs.We did have breakfast in the hotel one day - it was nice, with plenty of variety, but the cost was extortionate. I'd recommend going just down the road for pancakes and eggs instead. Check out was also slow, as you have to nip in between the big groups, but again, the staff were friendly and helpful. My only niggle was with the lifts - they were quite slow, and there didn't quite seem to be enough of them, so it was a few minutes wait around breakfast time to go up and down. But this was a minor issue, and I thought the rest of the hotel was fine. It isn't perhaps as nice as some other nearby hotels, but it was much cheaper, and to be honest, I prefer that. For the price we paid, I'd definitely use it again, because the location is superb."
234,1889,"Sep 26 2008 	Great location TERRIBLE hotel	I recently stayed here for four nights while on a business trip to NYC. When you have to wait almost a half hour to check into a Manhattan hotel at 11:30 PM, you know you're not in for a great stay. I am convinced that those who gave this hotel positive reviews either have very low standards or have never stayed anywhere else in NYC. First, the place is no bargain. When room rates start north of $400/night, I expect better than a 30 minute wait, outwardly surly front desk staff and a claim that the room type I selected (and they confirmed, with a late check in guarantee) was no longer available. After refusing to accept a lesser room (without a reduction in the room rate), the manager (who I requested complete my check-in after the shoddy service from the clerk) suddenly &quot;found&quot; the proper room type for me. Of course, it really didn't matter. While the rooms are a bit larger than the norm for NYC, they are spartan, poorly decorated and not in any way set up for business travel. There are no amenities to speak of, terrible bedding, rough towels and an all around &quot;rough around the edges&quot; feel to all the furnishings. The housekeeping staff could use a refresher course in the fine art of housekeeping. The outdated AC units rattle all night and the curtains never quite close enough to shut out the morning light. Hotel staff runs the gamut from incompetent to indifferent to outright rude. If you need internet access, head to the Starbucks on the corner. The &quot;wi-fi&quot; is so slow that it made me long for the days of dial up...yes, it was that bad. While the location is great, there is nothing about this hotel worth the price. Stay at the nearby Le Parker Meridien of you want a great hotel in the same area. In any other city The Park Central would be called a Days Inn...and that's an insult to Days Inn."
235,1889,"Sep 22 2008	Well situated	This hotel is situated just a five minute walk up from the pandemonium of Time Square so you can pop in an out of the mayhem at will. Its less that that to get the oasis of Central Park. The hotel reception and concierge were very helpful and the bar staff pleasant. Not much I can add re the hotel, its another one that does what is says on the packet, we generally enjoyed the hotel and its location. We also love New York - there is something for everyone."
236,1889,"Sep 21 2008 	Nice hotel/location.. Would return.	My girlfriend and I stayed here in early September 08 for 7 nights.When we booked it, the reviews on Trip Advisor were pretty good and someone we knew recommended it so we thought 'why not?'As we got closer to departure, the reviews on here were terrible, so to say I was concerned would be an understatement.However, my fears were unjust as we really enjoyed our week long stay here. The hotel staff at the front desk were very polite and helpful as were the staff at the concierge desk, who gave us lots of help and tips for our sightseeing etc.The rooms very spacious (more spacious than I expected) and were very clean, as to be expected.The location is excellent. Its on 56th and 7th, which is a couple of minutes from Times Square and about 4 or 5 minutes from Central Park. There is also a subway station right next to the hotel too.However, our stay wasn't without some issues, minor as they were.When we arrived, I asked for a room on a high floor, which I was given without any trouble but when we reached our room, it was very warm and clammy. The air conditioning wasn't working.I called the front desk and they immediately supplied us with another room (next door). I was quite pleased with the quick outcome.The other, and last, problem we had proved to be a recurring one. The hotel keycard 'decoded' 3 times during our stay. This became a little frustrating as it only seemed to happen when we got to our room after a very long days and really needed to put out feet up.So, the journey down to the front desk to get a new card (ID is needed for this) and then back up again became a tiresome task.The reason was to do with the keycards being in close proximity of mobile phones or credit cards. Mobile phones I can understand but credit cards?. Come on!Aside from those little mishaps, I was very happy with the stay and would definitely return, although, probably not in September again, as it was quite expensive.Its nearly half the price in the cooler months so Ill be bring my gloves and scarf when I return!"
237,1889,"Sep 18 2008	Will not go back : (	My mother and I stayed at the Park Central hotel in NYC for 6 days in September. We were quite impressed when we walked into the hotel lobby, but were quickly unimpressed by the front desk guy who acted as though we were bothering him by checking in. out of about 4 front desk workers i spoke to over the duration of our stay, 1 was pleasant. The room did not have a coffee maker or anything extra to make the stay more welcoming. just shampoo and soap, not even a shower cap. but that isn't a big deal, but when you pay $400/night, you think you'd be getting the best of the best..but i guess it is New York after all and it is waaay more expensive. What was a big deal, was our first day of housekeeping, someone went into my suitcase and stole my favorite skirt! i didn't notice until the next morning when i went in to get dressed for the day and realized it was gone. We searched every inch of the room for it. We contacted security who was really friendly and said that this does happen. I had my suitcase closed, but not zipped...so be sure to zip and lock it! i've traveled all over the world and stayed at all levels of hotels and never experienced this. we kept the room locked and security ensured that no one would enter our room without a supervisor. we asked that we not have our room serviced again. well the next day not one, but two people tried to enter our room while we were in there! I told front desk who didn't seem to care. In the end all we got was $100 off our $400/night room for a &quot;guest complaint&quot;. they wouldn't even comp the one movie we rented on the tv. terrible! barely covers the cost of the item that was stolen. i'm just glad more wasn't taken from me or my mom.On a positive note...Conceirge was AWESOME!!! which we later found out were not employees of the hotel, but a hired company placed in the hotel. they were FANTASTIC!! best service ever! heck i'd go to the hotel just for info! definitely not to stay.Room service was crazy expensive. so we never ate at the hotel so i can't judge the food, but it must be good for that price!I would stay somewhere else next time for sure, because of the theft. the location was pretty good. although i would recommend staying on the other side of Times Square, where you are more central to everything.Good luck in your hotel search!"
238,1889,"Sep 13 2008 	Location location location	This hotel is situated in a fantastic spot for sightseeing, at a much lower price than the two Sheratons and Hilton nearby. The drawback is it is not nearly as nice.The lobby is nice, even though it does immediately feel like the &quot;tourist storage container&quot; it unfortunately is. Too crammed with people. We had a lower floor room, which was sad and shabby, but very large. We were in NYC to be tourists (it was my girlfriend's first time there), so it was OK as we spent very little time there. Breakfast was not good, the service terrible and the waiting time unacceptable. After the first day, we went to the Sheraton for breakfast every subsequent day. NYC hotel prices are notoriously extortionate, so it seemed like a wise choice to go for the Park Central. I think we did it a bit too much on the cheap, though. I won't be going back: it's worth being ripped off a little bit more to be in a better hotel."
239,1889,"Sep 11 2008 	It Was Okay	Stayed here for 1 night as a last minute NYC trip. Hotel was nice, clean room, but for a King Size bed very small. The front desk people were very nice &amp; helpful. the only problem I had was when we booked the room we were not advised of the contstruction being done to the face of the hotel. It was a bit noisy during the morning hours. Other then that it was an Ok trip."
240,1889,"Sep 10 2008 	Brilliant	Have just returned from staying at the Park Central hotel and after reading some of the reviews was a bit worried. We found the hotel to be brilliant, no complaints at all. Lifts were fine, check in and out was fine, air con fine, employees pleasant and helpful and rooms were clean. View was a brick wall, but then we didn't spend much time in the room to worry about that. If you are looking for somewhere to eat there are loads of delis etc, but we did like the food at the maison restaurant (which is if you come out of the hotel turn right). Location is brilliant about 10 min walk to time square and 10 minute walk to central park. We flew into Newark and got on the liberty bus to Port authority which cost $25 each return and then we got a taxi to the hotel which is about $6. I would return there no problem. If you would like more info please contact me."
241,1889,"Sep 10 2008 	Don't stay here when it is hot	Hi. I can't say I have ever written a review. But I felt obligated. I read a lot of reviews about the A/C not working. I thought that couldn't be true. But it is. The hotel is clean and staff seemed friendly. I told them the A/C was blowing air -- not cool and not warm but just air and they responded kindly, but didn't fix it. All this to say, this is probably a great hotel in the winter. For summer stays at $300/night I'd stay somewhere a with A/C. Have fun!"
242,1889,"Sep 8 2008 	BAD experience	We had booked 2 rooms. Our friends had upgraded to a concierge room which they found out meant they had a coffee maker in the room for an extra $70.00 per night. I am not exaggerating. This was the case. We looked at each other's rooms and discovered that the only difference between the 2 rooms was that the more expensive room was SMALLER, had a coffee maker, and was seven floors higher...which meant absolutely nothing as both rooms looked directly across into other rooms...absolutely no view. The rooms were very small especially the &quot;concierge&quot; one. When we told the staff that we wanted to change the upgraded room to a regular room as they could not possibly believe that this was ok...we were met by blank stares and told they couldn't do anything about it until the other manager came in in the morning...but no matter what we would be charged the higher rate for the first night. This hotel was not at all special and not that clean... so ...frustrated... we told them we were leaving. We went down the street to the Sheraton New York where we stayed in a very nice room for less money than this place!!!"
243,1889,"Sep 1 2008 	Check your bill!	Pros: 1. Great location. 2. Quick check-in and check-out.Cons: 1. Air-con was loud and the lid on our control panel was stuck so we couldn't change the temperature. 2. You have to pay when you leave your bags at the concierge - US$3.50 a bag!3. This is the huge deal-breaker. When I returned home and received my credit card bill, I was charged an extra night's stay which I did not authorise! I emailed the hotel twice in the last 5 days and have yet to receive any form of acknowledgement that they are looking into the matter! I will keep trying and hope to get some resolution!"
244,1889,"Aug 31 2008 	A great location and a nice hotel	We spent 9 nights in this hotel during our first trip to NY.As a group of 9 people (3 families with children, from 7 to 9 y.o.) we found the location very good, in the middle of Theater Discrict which means a lot of shops and restaurants always open and 10 minutes wals away from 5th avenue and Central Park.The hotel was very nice and with big rooms. The concierge was nice enough to find all the 3 rooms in the same floor. We were at the 7th, but if you manage find one on higher level to reduce street noises.Breakfast was not included and pretty expensilve (25$ pro people) but there are a lot pf places around where you can have it at a more reasonable price (look for the Au Bon Pain shop that is 3 minutes walk away).The metro station is really under the hotel so it's very useful to get it.Surely we'll come back there in our next trip to NY"
245,1889,"Aug 27 2008 	No Air Conditioning during the July heat wave!	I went to NYC in early July for a job interview. The company paid for my travel and booked this hotel. When I got there, the room was HOT. It was during the heat wave and so I thought it was just going to take a while to cool off. When I called the front desk, I was told that the air conditioning was broken, but that this wasn't &quot;nearly as bad as yesterday.&quot;I tried to make it work, even by opening the windows. It was just miserable.I went downstairs to try and get a refund and waited for over an hour in the angry mob. The manager agreed to refund me, but since it was paid through Travelocity, it would just show up as a refund on this company's credit card, and I still wouldn't have a place to sleep for the night. I asked if they would help me get another room. No. Finally, at about 11:00 and after talking with Travelocity, I decided to stick it out.Then, the general manager from the front desk called me and said that he had issued me a refund already since I wanted to check out, and I would have to repay this or leave. OMG, this was such a hassle!The next day, I had to put on a business suit and panty hose in the sweltering heat (still no a/c) and no, needless to say I did not get the job.I will NEVER ever stay at the Park Central again!"
246,1889,"Aug 27 2008 	Very Disappointed with Park Central - seems to be a hit 	My husband and I stayed at Park Central hotel for 8 nights in July 2008. We were extremely disappointed with our room - the air conditioning was not working and we were simply given a fan to rectify the problem. As it was the middle of summer this was certainly not acceptable. I called a number of times to vent our disatisfaction and asked if we could move to another room. We were told there were no other rooms available. Towards the end of our stay (I think day 5), a technician came and was able to eventually fix the problem. Our room was extremely small in size and for an 8 night stay, it felt very claustraphobic. I once again vented my frustrations but no solution was offered.Our room was not vacuumed daily and when I called housekeeping to report the problem, we were told we needed to request a daily vacuum. I requested it, but it still did not happen. You can imagine that after 8 nights, the carpet was very grubby. Our bedlinen was also not changed daily. We were paying a hefty daily rate and daily fresh linen is expected in quality hotels. This was not the case with our stay at Park Central. Our room safe was not working and kept flashing &quot;battery&quot;. I reported this problem and it took 3 days for someone to come and replace the battery. Luckily our valuables were not stolen during this time.We will definitely not be coming back to this hotel The location of the hotel is the only poisitive thing I can say about it!"
247,1889,"Aug 23 2008	Terrible	Aside from a good location, nothing at all to rave about. First of all, they didn't trace our reservation so we were double-charged in the end. Second, they gave us an already-occupied room at first! Other: total absence of help with luggage, broken elevators, rude and unhelpful staff all around, non-existent air con. For us, it was one of the worst value-for-money ratios to date worldwide (we travel very frequently for business and holiday)."
248,1889,"Aug 19 2008	Hit or Miss	Stayed here twice. First time got a junior suite on a high floor with a view. The room had been recently renovated at the time and was all I could ask for. Second (and last) time got a cramped, musty, smelly hole on a lower floor looking onto a brick wall. Front desk was overwhelmed and of course unable to help when we requested a change. Frankly the experience was the opposite of the previous visit. Won't be back."
249,1889,"Aug 16 2008 	Best hotel ive stayed in in a long while	ok, i booked this hotel as it was in a very good deal on a website, and was far too good to turn down. Wasnt until after booking it that i read the reviews and started to worry, it really isnt written up as a great place on here.Boy was i to be surprised!We arrived at 1930 on a thursday evening, walked straight up to the front desk, no Q's and checked in. This took less than 3 minutes.Then we were pointed in the direction of the lifts, and within 4 more mins we were in our room, number 738.The lifts had signs up saying apologies for delays but they are renovating them, and i have to say, we didnt wait once for a lift, pushed the button and one arrived pretty much straight away.We soon found that there are a couple of elevator shafts in this hotel and if you have your back to the reception desk, then take the corridoor on the left and follow it round, that lift section is really quick.The room itself was a quad room, 2 large double beds, a bathroom and a huge cupboard.the bathroom was big, a full size bath, big sink and a toilet. It was cleaned daily, as the bath took a little while to drain when having a shower, (approx 3 mins after getting out and tunring the water flow off) and fresh towels put in the room each day, altho they do ask you to reuse them, but if you dont want to, just leave them in a heap and they get changed daily. The comlpimentary toiletries were replenished each day too. There were 2 plug sockets in the bathroom and a hairdryer. Be warned with the hairdryer, if you have anything longer than eye level it will take a while to dry it with this. Mine is shoulder length and very thick, but with the humidity out there it frizzed very quick anyhow, so only used it to dry off the excess water!So nothing wrong with the bathroom.Enter the bedroom.There are no ceiling lights, only stand alone ones, 2 taller ones and 2 table top ones on the bed side table. These created plenty of light.There is a closet in the bedrooms, and to describe the amount of space, i would say you could easily get approx 15 fully grown adults in it! It was huge. As there were 4 of us sharing a room, i actually used it to get changed when the bathroom was being used, and i had more than enough room!There was an ironing board and iron in it, a safe, and two hanging rails with hangers. There were also spare blankets and pillows in there. Perfect.There was a large flat screen tv in our room, and it had a lot of channels, we had no probs finding anything to watch!! There is an ice bucket and glasses on the desk too next to the tv, but no kettle or tea/coffee/biscuits in the room. If you are there on business, there is also another table with chairs there you can use.The air con, a lot of people on here have complained about it, i really dont see why. We were in NYC while outside temps were in the late 30's, and we put it on high while out during the day and when we came in, it was nice and cool, we turned it down a bit while in the room as it became a bit nippy and if you are in the bed next to it, can be a bit blowy! (but as i wasnt in that bed, it really didnt bother me at all!!)The unit itself was located under the window, and certainly done waht it was there to do, cooled the room right down, so no complaints at all about it from me.The beds. they were lovely. The pillows so comfy, i slept nearly as good as i do in my own bed, and if it hadnt been for the other 3 in the room snoring, id have slept better! The sheets were changed every 2 days, and were all lovely and clean, there was a small burn mark, but nothing to complain about as i know that those sheets are done in bulk and can burn slightly when dried if not done properly, and the throw they put over the bed covered it anyway! You cant get under the bed, so im not sure how people have said that they are disgusting, and to be honest, why would you want to look undera bed in a hotel???It also appeared to be hoovered every day, i didnt once find crumbs or mess on the floor.After all the previous reviews on here, i can understand why someone would be so worried about it, but dont be, this hotel is perfect, and for the price, i was so impressed, i even tipped the maid!!!The staff in the hotel were very kind, we only really interacted with them 3 times. Arrival, which the lady was very pleasant, then to check check out time (12pm, but we managed 1pm at no extra cost) and to actually check out. All the staff we saw were very nice.Our homeward flight wasn't until 2135 on a tuesday evening, so as we had managed to secure a 1pm check out for free, we then stored our bags in their luggage store at $3.50 per bag. The hotel arranged a taxy to take us to JFK later that night and that cost us $65 with a $20 tip on top, which i didnt think too bad as there were 4 of us, and on previous visits to NYC, had paid over $80 in a yellow cab to get to the airport!If you want a late check out, between 12pm and 3pm is a $75 charge and any time after 3pm they charge you a whole days rate, which i think is a little excessive, but thankfully we didnt use it!The lobby of the hotel was very clean and tidy, we sat there for a couple of hours before our flight as we were so tired and worn right out from a very action packed holiday and no one asked us to move or questioned us. There are comfy sofas to sit on and a shop if you want anything.Can not fault this hotel at all, loved it. Please dont worry about staying here, its all you could want and more.We didnt use the internet service, or either of the 2 restaurants that are in it, but they all looked and sounded great!We ate a a few of the nearby delis and cafes. Cafe metro is great for a quick brekkie, and the deli on the corner by the hotel does really good cooked food and lots of little snacks and drinks that you can take back to your room.There is a subway opposite the hotel and a christmas shop!Central park is 3 blocks away, and times square is a 5 minute walk away, you can see it from outside the hotel!There are always taxis waiting outside if you need them, and concierge is there to help at all hours, with special deals on theatre tickets!Would i stay here again, definately, and i would really look forward to it!Any questions, please dont hesitate to ask, but if you have any doubts about this hotel, them put them aside, im a fussy person, and i cant fault it in any way shape or form. The best hotel in a long long time for comfort, cleanliness and location. What more can you ask??????"
250,1889,Aug 14 2008 	Renovated rooms but far from..	I stayed for 6 nights at the Park Central Hotel as I had it recommended from a friend. But it did not live up to my expectations. My room was suppose to be newly renovated but that was really difficult to see. The air condition was an old larming machine in the corner and the bath room was really torn down. The room was rather dirty and although I am used to various standard at hotels worldwide I felt that paying close to 300 $ per night you should at least expect a clean room. When complaining at the front desk the reaction from the rather unfriendly personnel was negative and I had to remain in the room. Attemps to improve cleaning seemed to fail or this was just the standard of the hotel! My room was located at 18th floor and since only one levator was in work during that week you had wait for up to 20 minutes to get up or down. The only really positive thing to say about this hotel is the location - close to Central Park.
251,1889,"Aug 11 2008 	Suits its purpose	Yes it is a sound reliable hotel but nothing special. If you are looking for something to fit in with a dream holiday then this is not for you. Clean, tidy, well located hotel. But very very busy so services fits in with that. Reception is run ragged day in day out. If you want a safe central warm hotel as a base for a frantic New York break then this is perecftly adequate.J,C and H"
252,1889,"Aug 9 2008 	A Great Value Hotel	I like many others was nervous when booking my stay at this hotel but my overall experience couldn't be further from it. To put it simply, this hotel is absolutely fine if you come to NYC to hang out and enjoy the city. If you wish to stay at a 5* hotel, then pay it. I took comfort when the Singapore Airlines air hostesses were seen staying there, which being arguably one of the best airlines in the world, says plenty.Overall, I found the rooms had plenty of space with a nice large flat screen TV. The room service was prompt and helpful and the rooms were cleaned everyday. THe only thing I found with it was the strange smell when walking into the lobby - perhaps the type of cleaning agent used, but I got used to it. The hotel prides itself on its service and for the price per night, it is great value for money."
253,1889,"Jul 30 2008 	Most Pleasant Stay	We stayed 7 nights at the Park Central and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had checked it out on a previous visit and thought it would fit our needs nicely. The rooms are fairly large for a NYC 3 star hotel. The KSB and pillows were most comfortable and the LCD TV is a bonus. The location is excellent; easy walking to the theatre and shopping districts and subway stops just one block away. We recommend a small restaurant &quot;Parisenne&quot; just 2 blocks north for a very good inexpensive breakfast.It is always interesting reading reviews; some love a place others hate it. While we required minimal interface with the hotel staff , those we talked with were very helpful and friendly. We did not find the elevators to be a problem as some previous reviews. Of course when 20-25 people queue up for an elevator you got to expect to wait a while. But they did not seem slow and they do have signs saying they are upgrading their elevators. Using the hotel web page we got a free night for staying more than 5 nights so the rooms averaged less than $260 a night including taxes which for midtown Manhattan in the summer is a bargain.We would defintiely stay again and since our son now lives in Manhattan, probably will. On a previous visit we stayed at the Salisbury around the corner and also recommend it; it was not available for this trip. It doesn't have the large lobby and restaurant facilities of the PC but the rooms and value are terrific."
254,1889,"Jul 29 2008 	Great location great price	I'm glad I did not read the reviews here before we went...Overall, we had a few problems but the location and price could not have been better for a weekend in July.PROS:1. Location, location, location2. Price3. CleanCONS: 1. No valet upon arrival as advertised. We stood in front of the hotel for ~5-10 minutes then gave up and found a garage on our own. A bell hop popped out once but seemed uninterested in why we were standing in front of the hotel. 2. The room smelled musty and the AC seemed to only be blowing air in from outside (the fan). Luckily it cooled off at night. We asked to have someone look at the AC several times - even called the operator, front desk and the &quot;complaint&quot; line multiple times late at night, upon our return to the room, but we couldn't get anyone to pick up the phone. Uopn check out the front desk said that at 10:30 the previous night engineering 'fixed' the AC. We couldn't tell it was fixed but they gave us a discount on the price of the room."
255,1889,"Jul 24 2008 	Good deal great location	Like many of the previous reviews, I'd agree that location is the biggest plus for this hotel, but all things considered, it was also a pretty good value...for NYC. The location speaks for itself...3 blocks from Central Park, a few blocks from Times Square and the Broadway theaters and a subway station right outside the door. Many shops, delis and restaurants within a block or two.The room size, though average by national standards, was above average for NYC with more than enough room for our base-of-operations. The room was clean and well appointed...no complaints. The only problem was that the AC, though on 'high', barely kept the room comfortable, but to be honest, others in our party did not have the same problem. The fitness center got raves from my wife for being clean and equipped with new machines. Personally, I never made it down to the fitness center, but did walk over to the Park for some very pleasant early-morning jogs. I booked through the hotel's website and got a discount for staying more than 3 nights, which made the average rate very competitive. All in all, I would certainly consider the Park Central for our next trip to Manhattan."
256,1889,Jul 16 2008 	Fantastic!	My boyfriend &amp; I stayed at this hotel on June 08. We were in New York for my 30th birthday and we were delighted with the hotel.It was spotlessley clean and the room was huge. We were on the 25th floor facing 7th avenue but the only noise we could hear was that of the air conditioning unit.The location was perfect - just a few minutes from central park and 5 minutes in the other direction to times square.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to New York. However don't eat breakfast in the hotel. There is a hefty service charge and our waiter did not care to assist us at all - he definately did not deserve the tip that was automatically added onto our bill.Other than that the hotel was perfect and if we return to NY it will definately be our first choice.
257,1889,"Jul 12 2008 	Great location for an average hotel!	My husband &amp; I just returned from a week in this hotel. I'll be honest after reading the latest reviews about this hotel I was TERRIFIED to stay at Park Central. I even looked into changing hotels the day before we left. Ultimately, I am glad that I didn't spend more money to stay somewhere else.We have stayed in NYC several times all in different hotels. We have stayed in one that was worse and stayed in better. I am a bargain vacation planner and I got a good deal on this hotel through Travelocity. If I had to do it again I'd probably try to find somewhere else for a similar price **only if** the location was as good as Park Central. This hotel is average. Our room wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews but it wasn't amazing either. The upside is that it really is in a GREAT location. If you go to NYC to spend time in the hotel I suggest staying somewhere else. If you want to go to NYC to be out and about in the city then this might be the place for you. The room provides an OK bed and decent size bathroom and room. Apparently, we were lucky and didn't have trouble with the elevators or maid service. The hotel served its purpose for our trip: somewhere to sleep, shower and get ready. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. If you can get this hotel for a good price I'd say go for it...if not then try to find another hotel.We had good luck w/ the staff as well. We only had one employee that was rude to us. She was at the concierge desk and got VERY SNIPPY when I asked about tours at Ground Zero. It obviously hit a nerve with her. Her response was offensive to us because the 9/11 attacks effected all of us not just New Yorkers. She told me there are &quot;no tours and nothing to see there&quot; she told us that it was &quot;just a construction site&quot;. I thought it was disgraceful for her to say that because that site will never be 'just a construction site&quot;. FYI: There are walking tours provided through the 9/11 museum called &quot;Tribute&quot; . It is located on the south side of the site and we were VERY glad that we took the time to go!"
258,1889,"Jul 12 2008 	Relatively Good Hotel	I stayed in this hotel a couple weeks ago with my family (Mom and Sister). Here are the pros and cons:Pros: GREAT location (could walk to Times Square, Central Park, etc), friendly staff, attractive rooms and lobbyCons: Room smelled old and musty, WAY overpriced for what you get, small roomOverall, it was a nice stay. I'm not sure if I would reconmend it, but the location enough is reason to stay there."
259,1889,"Jul 12 2008 	Very good hotel would definately stay again.	I too had some trepedations after some of the reviews here, so we were very pleasantly surprised and relieved to have a different experience than some have had, so much so, not only do we recommend this hotel, but we would book to stay there again. I would like to let you know why.....We arrived earlier than anticipated and bell hops were outside ready to help with luggage, but without any small bills to tip, we declined, no probs, we were not hassled. The entrance foyer and lounge was spotless and smelled so good! - over the weeks holiday we realised they must have had some kind of aroma pumped through the air con. The air con worked fine. Yes the staff were a bit frosty, but this isn't Disneyland, its a busy hotel, they were polite and professional, just didn't have wall to wall grins, but thats ok. The downside was the 4 pm check in, but we knew that in advance, and they have a secure area for luggage so fine, we went out! We booked two rooms with twin doubles for our family, we have two 16 year old boys, and the rooms were spotlessly clean, fresh towels, modern, full air con and a safe. No probs. Beds made, bathrooms cleaned every day. The rooms were a good size and great TV channels too. The bathrooms were also a good size and stock contantly stocked up daily. Yes, the 4 lifts only have two working in each bank of 4, and the strange thing is that the apology sign is screwed to the wall...a bit permanent we thought, but don't let this spoil your holiday. We took the stairs down and the lifts up, just you wait a bit longer sometimes. Not as long as the hour..oh yes...an hour, just to go down in the lift from the top of the Empire State! so the hotel we got used to, far less a wait I can tell you. We asked for a fan for our boys room and within 30 minutes we had it. The drinks machine took my money and no coke, within 15 minutes a drink was delivered to me to replace it. The hotel is in a brilliant spot, near to subway, cabs, central park, etc., but thank the lord a walking distance away from the noisy and smelly Times Square. Stay here and don't let slow lifts ruin your holiday. We had a fantastic time and would definately book this hotel again, it was good value for money. You want 5 star? book it and pay the price. Any problem we had or query was quickly answered and found the staff helpful. The security staff there are fantastic, all the staff very smart and professional. If you don't like your room, tell them and they will do everything to move you if they can, we know, we saw it happen. This is a good hotel. Their website does not do them justice, search the net and find other photos and reviews, its a big hotel, with a nice modern interior. Many we passed in NY made us glad we had booked at this hotel.Enjoy, go bite the apple."
260,1889,"Jul 9 2008 	Great Hotel	My boyfriend and I've just returned from a week long stay at this hotel. We were slightly apprehensive about staying here having read some of the recent reviews, however our fears were unfounded! We throughyly enjoyed outrwhole stay. The room was clean, spacious, quiet and well air conditioned. The staff were friendly and helpful whenever we had an enquiry - they were particularly helpful assisting us when our luggage was lost at the airport. Overall I would recommend this hotel to my friends - especially if booking through Expedia.PS I would say if you are planning on going to see a show dont buy tickets at the desk in the hotel as they dont offer reduced tickets and add on a substantial booking fee - there are great deals to be had at the TKTs desk off Time Square or the Tourist information centre in Time Square."
261,1889,"Jul 3 2008 	Not recommended	Bad choice, I would not go back. The elevators were broken, so going to and from your room became a hassle. Location was okay  staying near the subway is important for tourists. Not much light in the rooms. Staff were okay  cleaning times were unpredictable and took forever. Room was dirty  mould in the shower, dirty walls, wrinkled sheets, etc. Requested a non-smoking room, but it stunk of smoke  changing rooms was going to be a huge hassle so we just dealt with it. Definitely would not go back there."
262,1889,"Jul 1 2008 	Good value for money	Having read many of the reviews before my wife and I stayed here I was a little concerned at some of the negative reviews. This is usaully not me as I am only interested in the consensus which appeared to be, on the whole it was a good hotel.Here is my balanced and accurate review of the hotel.As others have commented the location of the hotel is perfect, there is a subway right outside the hotel and from there you can get anywhere. Also, as it is on 7th Ave its easy to get a cab. The hotel is within walking distance of most of the sights i.e. Empire State Building, Rockafella centre and as the name suggests very close to Central Park. It also is located near lots of restaurants, deli's and bars.The reception area is immaculate and very smart looking, wer checked in quickly and fine at 4pm, your room may not be ready before then. The room was perfect in size and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in on my travels. This with the huge flatscreen TV was more than acceptable for what we paid. The bathroom was fine and the maid service was very good too. We were never disturbed by the maids and they were always quick to tidy the room up if we had slept in and gone out later. The a/c was bit old and a bit noisy but really not a big deal as it worked and the room was cool.I did notice the comments about reception staff being rude or 'less than friendly'. Well to be honest people need to get over this and stop being so picky. YES I have been in hotels where the staff are more friendly and YES there was the odd member of staff on the reception who could have been more polite but this is NEW YORK for goodness sake - most people you speak to are very direct and 'to the point' -thats just the way they are in NYC. If they were 'direct' with me I was 'direct' with them. In essence most of the bad comments aimed at reception are clearly down to just two guys who out of a team of 10 people work daily - they just need to cheer up and smile a bit but thats really all there is too it- its no big deal. The rest of the recpetion staff were fine.The hotel is fine, really. Its only a base and a place to shower/sleep for gawd sake and a hotel in NYC and should be nothing more than that in this great city - the less time you spend in your hotel the better- there is too much to see and do to waste time moaning about the hotel. If there was something really bad about this hotel I would have spotted it but I think some people are just too fussy sometimes when writing reviews!The Park Central hotel does have faults if you are picky enough to look for them but if you want a good hotel, thats clean, well positioned and comfortable this place is fine for what you pay. You can pay a lot more if you want the best but whats the point.Again, this hotel is FINE.PS Refuse offers of 'taxi's' from the hotel staff as they are just trying to get you to take an expensive limosine run by the hotel to wherever you want to go. Just insist on a yellow cab and you'll be fine.PPS Best deals I found were through Expedia."
263,1889,"Jun 27 2008 	Hated hated it!!!	If you are thinking about staying here do yourself a favor and DON'T. I stayed at this hotel once last year and I remember complaining about the A/C..they had told me back then that it was a temporary thing. When I recently stayed there in June paying around $420.00/night the A/C was practically nonexistent....it was ridiculously hot in the rooms. The staff was not helpful at all and you can see obvious signs wear and tear around the hotel...(ex exposed sockets, peeling wallpaper..). And the icing on the cake was when I saw a happy little cockroach roaming around the room...Even if they gave me a free room I wouldn't stay there.."
264,1889,"Jun 26 2008 	We were there for ten days part of it during no air-conditioning.	My husband and I were in NY for medical treatments. We had booked the Park Central Hotel off their own website to get the 20% off for staying over 5 nights. The first few nights the air-conditioning wasn't working. We were told several times that it would be fixed soon. I had an IV in my arm, so I went to talk to customer service. They sent a fan up to my room a few hours later. The fan helped a lot, but it still wasn't air-conditioning. The third day we spoke to the manager, who was very polite and being bombarded by several people, including us. I wrote a long letter to her and suggested how they should handle the situation. That night the air was back on. The rest of the stay was great. I don't think it was as dirty as people said. The cleaning ladies were really friendly. They did run out of small towels at times, but there were a lot of people there. We just helped ourselves to the linen closet in the hall and grabbed whatever we needed. A bellhop was also available to take our things upstairs when we got there. He was very friendly also. I didn't encounter anyone being outright rude, but I did feel they should have communicated better right from the start of the air-conditioning problem, and I told them that. After searching for hotels for a long time in NY, you have to expect that you won't get as much for the money as somewhere else. That's just a given. Overall, it was a good experience. The room was a fair size, compared to many others that are incredibly small. I felt the staff was friendly. The restaurant there is way too pricey, as well as the room service. The location is wonderful. It's close to Times Square, but not too close to be uncomfortable with all the noise and crowds. It was so close to Central Park. We also liked that we could walk easily to Columbus Circle where there's a Whole Foods Store in the Time Warner building. We bought some groceries there for lunch to save money. It's also right next to the subway, so it was easy to go anywhere. The only problem is that the city closes some of its entrances on the weekend--that's irritating. The best part was when we checked out. We asked for a later check-out and they let us check out at 3:30 without paying anything extra, probably because of what we had been through with the air-conditioning. They also took off about $400 from our bill. I think when you're faced with a problem in the hotel like that, you need to be persistent, but still controlled. They responded very well to us. In the end, it paid for us to sweat out the three days. The rest of the time was great! We would go there again, but we'd probably call ahead first to see if the air-conditioning is working."
265,1889,"Jun 26 2008 	Small - Hot - Rude / thats all	Where do I start.1. No bellman to assist with 4 peoples luggage2. Room had no towels on arrival @ 5 pm3. Bathtub had hair in drain4. A/C...non operational5. Rude staff when asked to review problems.6. No response when conplained over Hotel website after trip.You book it...you can expect the same.I travel 40 weeks out the year, never have had this bad of an exprience."
266,1889,"Jun 26 2008 	Better than expected	I was booked into this hotel by someone else and after I read the other reviews, I was a bit concerned. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was reasonably efficient (although staff were a little frosty) and our room was decent sized, comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient for getting the subway or going on foot. For the price, this hotel wasn't too bad at all."
267,1889,"Jun 23 2008	Very Convenient Location	Right next to the subway and very close to all attractions.Rooms are good size for New York. Sound isolation was really good. We were next to the elevator and never heard a &quot;ding&quot;Go to the Starbucks on 56th (less than a block away), the one attached to the hotel is way to inefficient for a busy place.Internet is more than $14/day, pay Tmobile $9.99 at StarbucksElevator are super slow."
268,1889,"Jun 23 2008	**CAUTIION** STAY AWAY...... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !!!!!	We took a group of 34 college students to perform at Carnegie Hall in mid-June 2008. The entire air conditioning system for the hotel was non-operational. All of the rooms in the hotel were without air conditioning, and simple ventilation was impossible as all room windows were sealed closed and unable to be opened. It was truly a miserable experience. There were several hundred people (performers) in this hotel during this week stay. Some travelers were very fortunate and left for other better hotels in the immediate area. Our groups could not leave due to the number of rooms required to accommodate everyone. The bedroom carpet in the Presidential Suite was soaking wet and was unable to be walked on. After three calls over a four hour period a maintenance worker finally showed-up with a mop instead of a wet-vac. The carpet remained soaked for three days and the smell of wet, soggy &amp; moldy carpet was beginning to become unbearable.Most of the front desk personnel were extremely rude, condescending and belligerent and continually displayed an &quot;I really don't care&quot; attitude. &quot;You want to stay here, then this is the way it's gonna be&quot;Room service dishes and restaurant catering dishes/trash were left in the room for three days without being removed. When the maid was asked about removing them, she stated that it was room service's responsibility to remove the dishes and trash - not hers. A room burglary and theft of jewelry from one of the performer's rooms in this hotel really put a damper on our overall experience. All of these issues were discussed in person with the hotel's Sales Manager- Ms. Pooja Pendse, who promised to adjust our final hotel bill due to all of the above. THIS NEVER HAPPENED !!There are several other similar and/or much nicer hotels for the same money in the immediate area who want your business and are willing to work for and earn it. At this hotel, from the executive management office - to the front desk personnel - to the people who clean your rooms - NO ONE CARES !!CAUTION&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stay away from this hotel - you will certainly waste your money and most certainly be very disappointed !"
269,1889,"Jun 19 2008 	Worst hotel experience ever!!!	I booked the Park Central New York after looking at several hotels in midtown Manhattan that were close to Carnegie Hall. I booked a concierge room with a king size bed from Wednesday, June 11, 2008 - Monday, June 16, 2008. From the pictures on the website, the hotel looked comfortable and clean. When I arrived at the hotel, it seemed hot in the lobby but I figured that it was just me because I had been walking with all of my luggage. When I got to the room, I realized that it wasn't me. The air conditioning was out in the room. The fan was on in the air conditioning unit, but it was blowing out air that was room temperature (which was easily 90 degrees). I spoke with the lady at the front desk about the lack of air conditioning in my room and I asked her if I could be moved. She stated that the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel so it would do no good to be moved. I asked her when the air would be fixed and she said that she had no idea. She went on to say that the air had been out for over a week and they are just taking it day-to-day at this point. The temperature in the hotel was the topic of conversation for every guest that I encountered in the elevators and the lobby. People were checking out of this hotel as quickly as they could. Although I was uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it and see if I could sleep in the room. Due to the high temperature and the fact that there was absolutely no air circulation, I was not able to fall asleep for hours. I lay in bed most of the night sticking to the sheets, tossing and turning in vain to find a cooler spot. By the next morning, I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in this hotel for 4 more days. So, I checked on the Wellington Hotel across the street. They had air conditioning that worked and the rooms were clean and comfortable and they were over $100 less per night than the rooms at the Park Central New York. So, I checked in at the Wellington on Thursday, June 12, 2008 and checked out from the Park Central New York on the same afternoon. When I told the gentleman at the front desk of the Park Central New York that I was checking out due to the air conditioning, he said that he understood. Then, he told me that the hotel would be charging me for my entire reservation with the exception of Sunday night. My original reservation was for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was checking out on Thursday afternoon and the gentleman at the front desk actually said the hotel was going to charge me for 4 nights that I was not sleeping in the hotel. I couldn't believe it. I demanded to speak to the hotel manager and stated that I wasn't going to be paying. The gentleman at the front desk went back to speak with his manager and then came back to tell me that the hotel would not charge me for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. However, they were still going to charge me for Wednesday and Thursday night. I still couldn't believe that they were going to charge me for a night that I had not stayed. Then, I saw the rate that they intended to charge me. They were charging me $400/night. When I had booked the room on the website, I had booked a concierge room. The website has a promotion where you get 20% if you stay for 5 or more nights. The total reservation came to $1,700 for 5 nights. I could not understand how the hotel was now charging me $853 for just 2 nights. I told the gentleman at the front desk that I was not even given a concierge room with a king size bed as I had requested in my reservation because one was not available when I checked in at 7:30 PM on Wednesday night. He went back to speak with his manager about my rate and stated that they would take $100 off of my charge for Thursday night. So, my final bill for staying in this hotel for 1 night in a room that was not air conditioned and did not have a king size bed as reserved and was not a concierge room as reserved was $753. This is complete and total highway robbery. I would also like to mention that the wireless Internet in the room I stayed in was not working and neither were 3 out of the 5 lamps in the room. I would also like to mention that the linens on the beds were stained with what looked like dried blood. There was no bellhop to assist us with our luggage when we checked in either. The elevators were extremely slow, but the hotel has signs up that say that they are renovating the elevators. From the dust on those signs, I would say that they have been up for months. After having such a bad experience with the Park Central New York, I contacted my parents and my sister and her husband who were planning to check into the Park Central New York the next day. I told them to cancel their reservations immediately because the hotel had no air conditioning and because of the horrible service. They cancelled their reservations 24 hours before they arrived, but the Park Central New York still charged them for their entire 2-day reservations. My family is now going through the chargeback process with their banks to have these charges reversed. I would like to mention that I checked into the Wellington Hotel across the street from the Park Central New York hotel on Thursday afternoon. The room there was extremely clean and comfortable, my room was larger, had an Italian marble bathroom, a walk-in closet, an incredible view of Times Square and my total bill for a 4 night stay was only $1,052. It is hard to believe that the Park Central New York would act like they did and charge what they did when there is a better hotel that costs less money directly across the street. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Park Central New York hotel is even still in business. My advice to anyone who is planning on staying at the Park Central New York hotel is to stay at the Hotel Wellington. You'll be much more comfortable there and pay less money for your stay and there is absolutely no difference in the geographic location since the hotels are across the street from each other. Please avoid the Park Central New York hotel at all costs."
270,1889,"Jun 19 2008 	Terrible Hotel	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. No air conditioning during a heat wave. Rooms had a fan unit but you could not set the temp and it never blew out cool air. Rooms were dirty and moldy smelling. Mold on ceilings and mirrors. Dirty carpet. One room the bed sheets were not clean. We switched rooms 5 times. One room, the toilet leaked all over the bathroom floor.All hallways smelled of smoke and were very hot. No cold water in vending machines,staff told us to buy water in the gift shop, but the gift shop was out of water too.Saw numerous guest bringing fans up to their rooms.Was told by the staff if we wanted a fan we had to go buy one, just like the other guest. Internet never worked the 5 days we were there. Staff was very rude.Had to ask maid several times for towels,ice bucket liner,glasses, etc...Tried to call every number to get towels, and they never answered the phone.Had to make numerous trips downstairs for things the maid never brought.When I asked why they never answered the phone the manager said they had so many complaints to deal with that they didn't have time to take phone calls.Staff was extremely rude.Slept on cushions on the floor for 4 night because the mattress on the pull out bed in suite was so thin you could feel the metal coils through it, but at least that suite didn't smell of mildew. Tried to change hotels but every thing was book for the 5 days we needed a room. Horrible hotel. Stay at your own risk and call 311 to complain. I think it's a health hazard to not have air conditioning."
271,1889,"Jun 17 2008 	Everything You Need - Some Things You Want	I spent 4 nights at the Park Central Hotel. We found it to be a nice hotel with a good location. It doesn't have the stuff that you might find at a sheraton or westin, but for the price it's a good choice. We found though, during our stay that the hotel had everything you needed and only some of the things you want. Things you Need:Comfy BedGood LocationNice PriceCleanThings you want that they have:Decent sized roomLCD TVQuality Workout FacilityDecent Resturaunt / BarLuggage Storage at CheckinGood ServiceThings you want that they don't haveWorking air conditioning (at least when we were there)Spacious Lobby (it was always busy and loud)Luggage Storage at Checkout (but you can pay for it)Business Center (they have pay wifi though)It was a hot weekend in NYC and the A/C being out was a problem, but not enough to make me move. I just ate a lot of ice, it's not like you spend a ton of time in the hotel room there anyway. They were kind and gave me a discount and breakfast each morning. We made these reservations the day before and got out for an average of 200 / night. So for the price i was very pleased. The hotel seems to be the favorite of large school groups and foreign business travellers, so don't think you're going to relax in the lobby."
272,1889,"Jun 17 2008	Hot...Hot...Hot	Where do I start???? First, we were in NYC during the hottest few days in many years-June 7-10. We were there for a graduation ceremony, so we had no choice in the dates. The room was quite nice--to start--but on the second day when it was over 100 outside, we had no air conditioning to speak of, unless, you call the sputtering of luke warm air as a comfort..which for 2 days we were thankful for any air. Then the elevators went on strike along with the air conditioners. Three flights of stairs can be good for you but not in the heat and not when you are 80 years old, like my mom! With the price of food in NYC, it would seem a no brainer that the hotels have a small refrigerator but --nope--no frig. and no microwave--guess the electricity would take away from the air conditioner, plus, people might try to use the frig to cool the room. Oh, we did ask if they had fans available but we were told they had given out all the ones in the hotel BUT we could go buy one and they would reimburse us the cost. As for the other advertised aminities like the hair dryer - it was non-functioning, the light over the shower - nope, showering in the dark made the heat better or at least we claimed it did! Now with all the negative said: the managers and staff were very nice and we know they had no control over the air conditioning problems, plus, they did adjust our bill, which didn't help with the unbearable heat but at least we didn't feel like we were taken for a frightening ride...like the taxi ride from the airport to the hotel!"
273,1889,"Jun 17 2008 	Dirty rooms broken air conditioning broken elevators and bad management	We took three rooms at this hotel for a boys weekend in New York in June 2008. Upon checking in, we were told by the front desk that the air conditioning was not working and that for our convenience we could buy ourselves a fan and the hotel would reimburse us. The hotel refused to provide us with fans  they expected us to buy them. It was 88 degrees in New York and we had to sleep with the windows and curtains open to make the rooms bearable. This meant we got woken up each dawn by the daylight and the noise of the city outside.Some of us were put in smoking rooms, despite booking non-smoking rooms several months in advance. The corridors and the room stank of cigarettes.All three of our rooms had dirty linen, ranging from cigarette marks in the sheets and pillows, through to disgusting yellow stains on one of the duvets that looked liked someone had thrown a curry over the bed.Several of the elevators were out of service and we had to use the stairs up to the seventh floor.When we complained to the manager, he refused to do anything, saying that the elevators were fine and that getting fans for the rooms just isnt going to happen. He refused a refund or any form of discount. I have never seen a hotel manager less concerned with the wellbeing of his guests.This place relies on its location and tourists for its business. It is clearly not worried about repeat custom. Which is lucky, because we are never going back."
274,1889,"Jun 16 2008	NO AIR CONDITIONING!!! Tried to cancel but they charged me anyway.	All the bad reviews you've read are true. You really get the feeling that the staff could give a crap about you or your experience there. I tried to cancel for the following night but since it was 6pm (2 hours past the 4pm cutoff they charged me another $328 for another night). Trying to get to bed at night was awful- the heat was unbearable. Obviously, they didn't do the right thing and let us out of the agreement (since they didn't hold up there end of the bargain) but instead they took advantage of me and many other guests who wanted to go to a hotel that had air conditioning."
275,1889,Jun 16 2008	Inonia	Their internal controls are awful - they lost my booking and after 2 months charged 300 USD from my credit card without any authorization for fake booking.
276,1889,"Jun 15 2008 	Not Bad but not great	After I was told that my brother had booked me into this hotel, I looked on this website to read reviews and was not happy about what I read.Upon arriving at the hotel, I though the hotel look asthetically pleasing. We were exceptionally tired after the long flight and needed sleep. The concierge staff were very helpful. Dennis the manager who appeared to be helpful checked us in and tried his best to meet my requests of a quiet room. We went to the assigned room, only to find other people in our assigned room! I couldn't believe it. So we then had to go back to front desk and reassigned a new room! Finally assigned a new room. The room looked 5 star! Throughout my 8 day stay I found this hotel not to be of completely pleasing standards. Firstly my neighbours were so noisy. Then to my anger some person kept smoking in our corridor every night, which is not good for me as I am an asthmatic. I asked management to look into this, but the problem never got solved.Beds were comfortable.. however housekeeping never made my bed properly, the sheets were not tucked in and the beds not made properly. My linen had stains on them too.They never vaccumed the floor properly. I tested this, I left some crumbs on the floor and they didn't clean it up.The rooms are really stuffy! I had to open the window for air daily.Convenience wise the hotel is centrally located. I short walk to Central Park and Times Square. The best thing it is located near the 57th Street subway station.The room service annoyed me. I asked for a slice of Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, which I saw on the restaurant menu and they instead delivered this other cheesecake. When I questioned the person and said it is not the right one, he lied and told me it was white chocolate, which it clearly wasn't when I ate it. Stupid thing also, you cannot order from downstairs and then take it back to your hotel room. Room service is not worth the 18.5% + 10% + $3 ish dollars fee.The internet was slow and expensive!The room was still fairly noisy, which is standard in NY.I found it quite annoying that the hotel did not have a well equipped brochure stand. I had to waste time lining up up the concierge desk to ask advice. They were always busy. The room had no tea/coffee/microwave/sink facilities. This was annoying. Even The Salisbury hotel, a much cheaper hotel that I stayed in had these facilities.The lifts were so slow, sometimes I waited forever just to get the lifts!At least the bathroom was clean and equipped (minus a shower cap)Overall the hotel was average. I would describe this hotel as a chameleon. Looks great on the outside, but really it isn't so great, especially for the price that I paid."
277,1889,"Jun 13 2008 	Park Central Ghost Town!	You mean the Park Central Ghost Town. Lack of employees and the few that were there were no where to be found. Rooms have been remodeled and are quite large for the city, close to 850 square feet, but the air conditioning is horrible and non working. Vintage old wall units never been cleaned. Even in the lobby and common areas. I heard many complain during my short stay. Great location if your not going to be in your room until after midnight. No security anyone could walk into the elevators 24/7. I was price gouged but you can expect it in this tourist central location. Would not go back unless it was in the winter. If you plan on staying dont expect service and you wont find anyone to complain to about it."
278,1889,"Jun 12 2008 	The Good the Bad and the Ugly	First the good:The location is excellent! Park Central is central to some of New York City's most famous locations. It is just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Ed Sullivan Theatre, Broadway theatres, and Carnegie Hall. In addition, the double-decker sight seeing busses have a pick-up location right outside of the hotel. There is also a subway stop just outside of one of the doors. The area is nice and my husband and I felt completely comfortable walking late at night. The lobby is nice, as are the rooms. The rooms are good sized, by New York City standards, and are tastefully decorated. The bathrooms are plenty big enough. The bad: The elevators are PAINFULLY slow. It seems to be more of a problem when going down than when going up. I have no idea why, but that was our assessment of the situation. HOWEVER, they are supposedly upgrading their elevators and we did see a crew doing what appeared to be some signficant construction. So maybe this situation will rectify itself soon. We were only on the 6th floor, so we often took the stairs down, which really wasn't a big deal. If you plan to use the Internet, plan again. It is expensive, and like the elevators, painfully slow. The ugly, and I mean ugly:When we arrived to the hotel on Saturday, we checked into our room and turned on the air conditoning. When we returned late that night, the room was defintely cooler, but not the frigid cold that you often get when in hotel rooms that are cooled with individual units. We noticed this, but proceeded to bed. When we woke up Sunday, the room felt somewhat cool, but the unit didn't seem to be pumping out cold air. When we returned that night, it was obvious that the air was not working. We called the front desk, who told us that indeed the air was not working and that they were hoping to have the situation resolved soon and asked for our patience. My husband and I understood and dealt with the situation. Needless to say, the next morning, the room was VERY hot, as during our stay New York City was having record heat. We got ready for the day and were confident that all would be resolved when we returned that afternoon in order to freshen up for dinner. No such luck. It was still hot and now humidity was starting to settle in. Again, we inquired and again were told that it was broken, being repaired, but they believed that it would be on when we returned for the evening. We we returned from dinner, still no air. By Tuesday morning when we had only gotten about 2 hours of sleep because of the heat, I demanded that something be done. I talked to a manager named Denis who became loud during our conversation and attracted the attention of others checking in. He told me to call Orbitz and that something would be worked out, but he was pretty rude about it, even though I felt that I was being pretty courteous and polite. We did call Orbitz and they managed to get us $422 refunded, which apparently is the equivalent of 50% off of three nights of our stay. Many people have complained about the staff being rude; however, with the exception of Denis, my husband and I never found this to be the case. We always made it a point to great them by name and ask how they were before starting into our conversation. All in all, because of the location, I would consider staying here again, particulary if I knew that the temperature would be controlled."
279,1889,"Jun 12 2008 	Park Central Hotel terrible management	The first night we arrived and came back to hotel, room door ajar, radio blaring and showerhead sitting on side of tub. Asked to be moved and comped. They agreed2nd and 3rd nights no AC, heat wave 97 degrees. Hotel mgmt &quot;Dennis&quot; never available, no offers or assistance to move you to a new hotel. Lobby full of very angry people. After going through 3 different people and demanding a refund they did so. Also did not comp me on first night as promised, once again had to stand in line with other angry customers to get my bill adjusted.Maid svc awful. No clean linens on bed.Dirty walls.I would have been just as comfortable sleeping on a bench in Central Park."
280,1889,"Jun 12 2008	Crap hotel	This was the worst experience we have ever had at a hotel.The air conditioning was turned off to do some work. We were told it had broken down and that they were working on it. They did not even offer us water, this came during the heatwave June 7th - 9th. The rooms were not really clean and the blind in the bathroom had mold all over it and the elevators did not always work, its a long walk upstairs when there's a heatwave. We do not recommend this hotel at all. The people on duty at the guest relations desk were not interested in anyones complaints, there were many complaints regarding the A/C and other things."
281,1889,"Jun 11 2008 	Never Again!!	Don't stay at this hotel.Smug, rude, glib, and uncaring hotel employees.The employees will tell you one thing and you will find out they won't hold your room after all. Late check-in? They told you they would hold it? Forget it. No one cares. It doesn't matter. They gave our room away and made us wait over half an hour ... at 2:00 in the morning ... after I had confirmed a 2:00 a.m. check-in with ... Kev, the hotel operator ... and then put us in a room with stored items and appliances in it, and then had to change us again. They were smug and didn't really care about our inconvenience.I have stayed in hotels all over NYC, and the rudeness level here surpasses that of even the most abrasive New Yorker.There was poor air circulationin the room, and the room air conditioning is insufficient. The common halls are hot. I asked for a fan for my room and was told to go to Duane Reede's to buy one myself ... by the front desk clerk.The elevators are excruciatingly slow, which aggravates any extra trips you have to make to the front desk -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONES DOWN THERE.I had to grab a towel guy to get my wake-up call because no one answered any phones at all, and I tried every number in their little book they leave in your room. I tried all the extensions endlessly. The hotel is in a great location, but I would never stay there again. Plus, they are very expensive..Don't bother!!"
282,1889,"Jun 10 2008 	Nice place. Bad service.	I got a good deal on this hotel on the Web with airfare, etc. It is in a great location, curb appeal is nice, the lobby and rooms are on par for a descent place in NYC. BUT...The elevators hardly ever worked. Especially coming back down. Luckily we were only on the 4th floor and ended up taking the stairs most of the time to get out. Apparently the &quot;elevator repair&quot; signs have been up for quite a while now.And the $15 a day internet was so painfully slow, I could not even load a single page in less than 5 minutes. I eventually gave up and went to a local pub and hooked into someone's wifi. (I think it was called Rumors? Good pub.)The shower drain was too slow and so the shower would fill up with a few inches of water at every shower. So we asked for a new room. They asked we bring all our luggage back downstairs to storage so we could be &quot;checked out&quot; before we get checked &quot;back in&quot;. Well we got the new room 15 minutes later and took all our luggage back up to the same 4th floor. And yes, the shower was still the same problem. We wouldn't have moved if they had just told us that's just the way it is. And in the new room, the air was also not working either. So I guess we were downgraded.So if you are looking for a nice looking hotel in a great location for a fair deal, then maybe this is for you. But if you are staying for more than a couple days and you expect everything to actually work correctly, than I don't think this is the place for you."
283,1889,"Jun 4 2008 	Terrible experience for loyal guest	I have been staying here for business for almost five years and have referred several colleagues. In the past two years, the service, cleanliness, and just about everything has deteriorated continually. Because of the terrific location, I have overlooked a lot of bad experiences. My stay on May 22, 2008 put an end to that. I was booked into a horrible, dirty room on the third floor with an adjoining wall to an elevator that wasn't working properly and made a terrible scraping noise each time the elevator was operating. I called the front desk for almost 30 minutes with no one answering the phone. I went downstairs to talk to the manager on duty, who could not have been less interested in my problem and went further to say that since I had been allowed to check in prior to 4:00--I was stuck with that room and I should feel lucky to have it. He insisted there were no other rooms available, even after I went back to my room and checked on the hotel reservation site--there were plenty of rooms and the rate was $50 less than I was paying. I spoke again to the manager, who at this point became belligerent and actually smirked at me! He was clearly enjoying his position of power. I will not be going back."
284,1889,"May 30 2008 	Good Hotel We would absolutely go back!!	We stayed here for 3 nights a couple weeks ago and we loved it. The location was fantastic for our first visit to New York. Our room was clean and good size. I was a little hesistant upon reading all the bad reviews but after staying here I realize most people are just very picky. This is not a 5 star hotel. Alot of people reviewed badly cause the check in time is 4pm, and they got upset that they couldnt check in earlier, that the elevators were slow, or the people were rude. Well you know before going that the check in is 4pm. I found everything to be sufficient and the staff to be polite. The hotel bar was very convenient and John was a great bartender and very friendly. And its New York City, you need to spend very little time in your hotel anyways! We would absolutely go back!!"
285,1889,"May 30 2008 	This is a good hotel	This is the second time i have stayed at this hotel ,and it wont be the last. The guy on the desk was very nice, had a laugh and a joke while checking us in. We was early, it was 2pm, but there was a room ready, he said it was a slightly larger room on the 11th floor, but it was a disabled room with no bath, he said as long as we didn't mind no bath we could have it, we took it. There was no real view, we could just see 7th Ave and the park cafe over the road, nothing much else, but i didn't mind, i'd gone to New York to enjoy the city not the hotel view. The hotel is in a great location, about 3 blocks from Central park, about 6 from Times square, Subway around the corner and there are lots of places to eat near by and lots of shows on your doorstep. we did find the hotel bar a little expensive, but most hotel bars are, this was simply solved by not drinking in there and going somewhere else! There was a nice little Irish bar about 2 blocks away. Overall i enjoyed my stay and will definitely return to this hotelThere are 2 other things i;d like to say.First, People moaning about turning up at 1pm and there been no room available...Check in is at 4pm, if a room is available, they will give you one, just like they did me, if no room is ready, just wait, you;ve only paid for the room from 4pm, you can't have it if its not ready!And second ,theres a restaurant near times square called Maxies, me and my girl friend went to it, it was so bad we sent the whole lot back and didn't pay, i have never done this, it was by far the worst meal i have ever had!"
286,1889,"May 27 2008 	Great Location	The lobby of this hotel is very impressive, unlike the rooms. Like some reviwers, we found the desk clerk to be very uninterested and not friendly. There was no &quot;Welcome, please or thankyou&quot; uttered by the clerk.The room was on the 24th floor and we had a view of a brick wall. Upon entering the room, we found the bed was opposite the entrance, meaning that we had to lift our full suitcases over the bedside table to get in the room.We found the room clean and the bed comfortable.Location couldn't be better, being 2 blocks from Central Park, near to 5th Ave, Broadway and Times Square."
287,1889,"May 24 2008	Great value and location	I stayed at the Park Central for four nights on my first trip to NYC and would not hesitate to stay there again. The location cannot be beat. It's adjacent to the subway, close to many great dining choices (including the Carnegie Deli and Redeye Grill - yum!) and is within walking distance of Central Park and Columbus Cicle. I enjoyed going for walks around the park knowing that I was in a nice area and that the hotel was close. The rates were very reasonable, and the room was surprisingly spacious and had a comfortable bed and flat screen tv. I enjoyed the restaurant and bar downstairs although they can be pricey. Overall, if you're looking for a convenient place to stay at a good price, you won't be disappointed."
288,1889,"May 21 2008 	great hotel	We just returned from staying at the Park Central for the second time. This hotel is in a perfect location for New York visitors. There is a subway stop right outside. Many restaurants are within 1 block, it is easy to walk to central park, times square and most theatres. The rooms are quite large for ny standards and the bed and bedding is very comfortable. This time we had an inside room. We really liked it because we heard no street noise. The conceirge desk was much kinder this time around. THe baggae check is helpful and inexpensive. On any return trips to NY we will look at the Park Central first."
289,1889,"May 15 2008 	CHEAP CLEAN LOTS OF PRIVACY AND EXELLENT LOCATION!!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Park Central in January 2008 for 6 days, it was our first trip to New York and we loved every minute of it! The hotel was brilliant for what we needed. It was clean, with a large comfy bed, warm and quiet. The shower had hot water and was immaculate and the towels were fluffy! also room security was good. what else is needed??Like most people would be, we were worried after reading negative reviews on here. There was really no need to worry. The location of the hotel was fab, on 7th ave just 2 blocks from Time Square which was around a 5min walk. Everything we wanted to be close to was within walking distance, Broadway, restaurants, SHOPPING!!! there is a subway station just around the corner and there are touts for the greyline tour buses all along the avenue. Also central park is just to the right of the hotel. The hotel restaurant didn't look all that, we didn't eat there but why would you with so many great places to eat in little italy, china town and so on.Alot of people have mentioned rude staff, i didnt experience any probs but then what else do you expect from american new yorkers?! they are known for their abruptness! We weren't bothered once by the staff, and the cleaners were friendly whenever we passed. also they always waited until we had left the room before entering (no early wake up calls, cleaners letting themselves in! )We really enjoyed ourselves here, we were in a great location, but not too close!! I would def stay here again, and would hate to stay on top of Time Square, with the hustle and bustle, i can't imagine getting a peaceful night sleep there!!This hotel is by no means luxurious, or one of the best ive stayed in. but it is a wonderful city hotel and I would have payed alot more than i did to stay there. xxx Lea, London"
290,1889,"May 14 2008 	Rude staff...	Stayed a week ago. Rude front desk. Broken shower handle - hard to turn the shower on and off. Had told them before booking directly with them that we need a 2 hr delayed check out only then will we reserve a room. They said no problem at all. On the day, the rude front desk person refused even though they had made an official note of it. Told her the shower handle was broken.. she had no response, no apologies, just an 'Oh!'Never staying here again, even though we go to NYC every month - will stick to our usual hotels, except this time we needed one near Lincoln Centre."
291,1889,"May 14 2008 	Get A Good Rate And You'll Be Happy	$200/night average on Expedia.Institutional-style hotel: very big - many rooms, several elevators - all older (permanent-style signs posted &quot;pardon our elevator upgrade&quot; though no upgrading was apparently going on), odd-shaped rooms (was this an office building? my room (805) was about 10 feet wide and 30 feet long), etc. In need of updgrade, but centrally located to the Park/midtown/subway.Though on 8th floor, could hear some street noise and jackhammering: get an upper floor (23 floors).Also, get a good rate and you should be satisfied."
292,1889,"May 13 2008 	Location is everything!!!	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of April. The location is great - I was very impressed that central park is literally on your doorstep and we could walk to most of the major attractions such as Time Square and Rockefeller. The Grey Line tours which is a must to any new tourist to New York was located just outside which only added to the convenience.  The hotel itself was clean and tastefully decorated. Our room had two lovely large double beds but I was a little dissapointed with the lack of view (we looked out at Hooters accross the street) although I accept this is a big city so to be expected. My major gripe with the hotel is the lack of room amenities, no kettle for tea, coffee or even water and no mini bar. However the bar was expensive but conveniently located for a quick pre-dinner drink.  Overall I liked this hotel and may even consider going back when we re-visit New York. The rates were excellent , the amenities were clean but best of all was the location. However if you are going to New York for more than sight seeing and the hotel is important to you then I would look at a more luxurious resort get away."
293,1889,"May 12 2008 	Great hotel	It was my daughters 18th birthday celebration. We arrived at the hotel Saturday morning 10:30. A very helpful man named, Mike, checked us in and told us that they would give us a call if our room was going to be available earlier than 4 PM. We received a call about 2 PM and returned to the hotel for a quick check in at the front desk, Our room was on the 11th floor and a great room. Comfy bed, pillows and large. Great location, helpful and friendly staff.. Thanks so much for a positive experience."
294,1889,"May 10 2008	Fine !	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in November 07 this was a girly weekend away so this was just our base for washing and sleeping. It was fine the room was clean, spacious, hotel bar quite expensive (but dont drink there if you dont want to), staff fine and helpful recommending local restaurants and bars, trying to get us tables at various restaurants. We ate breakfast at the cafe (carnegie? its linked directly to another hotel) directly across the road, food great, we then tried breakfast elsewhere, which wasnt as good and service not as friendly.This hotel is perfect for what we wanted and yes it is only a 3 star so if you wanted a perfect gorgeous hotel go for a 5 star, for a shopping and sightseeing trip this hotel was brilliant as centrally located right near Central Park and approx. 2 blocks from 5th ave - if I remember correctly, and 10 minutes walk from theatre land.And yes we would all stay there again !"
295,1889,"May 9 2008 	Worst staff ever!	We arrived at 1pm in the front desk after coming from Boston. When we tried to check in the lady in the front desk said check in time was 4pm. We found that strange since we had called the hotel just hours before asking if a friend had already checked in and they told us no because check in was only 2pm. When I told the lady that, she was basically said I was lying. We came back later (6pm) and started the check in process again, this time a man (Emanuel) in the front desk. No smiles again, but at that point I couldn't care less. When he started the process and was about to give me my key, my friend came behind and said his last name hoping to start his check in process. The guy without looking at our face pointed to other desk. So my wife asked if he could not do our friend's check in and he simply answered with a lot of attitude (and with a very loud voice) that he was not finished yet. I simply asked why all that attitude, that was enough for the guy to start screaming at me saying &quot;I don't have to take this [--]&quot; and left me there, standing, without my room keys. Then he called the manager himself and when the manager came he again started screaming with him telling that he would not proceed with our check in.Unbelievable! I though I was at &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, but unfortunately that was all real.The location was ok, the room was old and stinky. Don't stay in this hotel unless is your last choice and you don't care about being screamed by people that is suppose to please you."
296,1889,"May 5 2008 	staff is difficult	We went to this hotel for a girl's weekend. Booked the hotel through NYC.com and got a confirmation of the rate. When we checked into the hotel, they said the rate would be $50 more per night. We spoke to the manager who said the reservation was placed, but the price would not be honored. That really seems rather crooked to me!The room was clean and spacious, so we were happy with that, but there were no towels in the room. We called housekeeping for 4 sets of towels and then went out for dinner. When we returned, they had only left 2 sets of towels, so we had to call housekeeping again!On Sunday morning, we were awakened at 8am with the maid trying to get into our room. Thankfully, we had the lock on, so she didn't get the whole way in. She yelled, &quot;Just checking!&quot; and then went to the next room. We heard her do the same at every room down the hall -- So much for our day to sleep in!This hotel is very busy and the lines are long! Would not stay there again!"
297,1889,"May 3 2008 	Fine hotel marred by unacceptably rude staff	Arriving exhausted at midday from London we were greeted by a stone-faced receptionist who told us that we could not check in until 4pm, which seemed unusual for a hotel. When we queried if there was anything we could do to get a room earlier, she blankly repeated that there was no checking in until 4pm as though we were there for her convenience. There was no apology, conciliatory gesture, welcome or smile and we were extermely taken aback by her rude manner. We had emailed days days before from England to request a non smoking room with a good view and noone had replied, and we had then called the hotel and been told our rquest had been noted but when we asked the recpetionist she did not seem to recognise this and said we had not been allocated a room and she could not promise anything because rooms were allocated first come first served after 4pm.Adding to the bizarre first impression, the lobby was filled with totally inappropriate techno-pop music relayed at ear splitting volume which did not lend itself to a relaxing environment and created a sense of impersonallity and discomfort.We had to take our luggage to a store room ourselves and had no option but to go out and try to fill time until we could check in. Although we were keen to see NY, we were dying to freshen up and rest after a very long journey so this was not fun, plus we were so concerned by the terrible welcome from the hotel that we became worried that if the staff were so dismissive, the room would be terrible too.Around 2.30 pm we were dropping with tiredness so we decided to go back in hope that a room might have come up. We queued for a receptionist for about 10 minutes - people around us were getting very edgy and there was an atmosphere of stress all around. Finally we got to the front and a man told us again we could not check in till 4. We collapsed in the terrible hotel bar balring TV and loud music and an indifferent waiter. Finally at 3pm we asked again if a room had become available and this time were told one had, again with no smile, apology or welcome.When we opened the door to our room on 12th floor we were very relieved as it did turn out to be fine - ok view, quite large, modern style. However the cleanliness was not really up to scratch - the carpet hadn't been vacuumed and there were a few small hairs in the bath. Room service was overpriced even before taxes and extra charges and wifi was slow. There was building work going on right outside our window and although we were out every day after that first day and waking early so it didn't prove a real issue for us, it would have stopped us sleeping any later than 8am and the hotel staff we asked about it told us it was only for one day which was not the case. The lifts were really slow and on one occasiona taxi driver purporting to work for the hotel fleeced us into using his cab instead of a yellow taxi, promising it was the same rate, but it turned out to be about 50% more expensive. We were amused to note on the desk in our room a card from a manager saying the hotel strived to impress guests! It said they emailed all guests after their stay to check they were happy but we are still waiting. The overall stay was just acceptable in the end, the location was excellent and other staff eg our maid were more polite, but the overall impression was of a hotel which simply did not care what guests' experiences were so long as they have got your money."
298,1889,"May 2 2008 	Wonderful location	Stayed at the Park Central April 15-17, 3 of us girls in our 40's and 50's sharing 1 room with double beds on the 5th floor. Found the hotel staff to be very accommodating and helpful. Arrived early so was able to check our baggage for free in the baggage check area. When yo check out you can store you luggage but there is a $3 fee per bag to do this but it still is a great service. Great location to everything for we wanted it to be comvenient to Lincoln Center and Rockefeller center. We did not eat at the hotel but there is a Starbuck right there and just across the block is Carnegie Deli and down from there the Stage Deli. Subway very convenient. Rate was high for the night for we booked ahead of time but they do offer some specials so check their website. Room was average with amble room for 3 people. Bathroom a good size and the beds were the best part. Room could use some sprucing up and the heat/air conditioner did not work and looked ancient. On the 5th floor we could here some of the street traffic but it wasn't too bad. Overall a very good time and experience and would recommend this hotel."

300,1889,"Apr 19 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed in the Park Central in March '08. Was very worried about it as some of the reviews on here are very negative. We checked in the hotel about 2.30pm, no problems what so ever, room was ready, we didn't have to wait to be seen to, person on the desk was polite and helpful. The room was bigger then i imagined, loads of space to fill with shopping bags. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was a good size, only negative thing being that the shower was not powerful at all, but this wasn't a big issue. Room was cleaned every day to a very good standard. Lifts were slow at times. Obviously more so at peek times of the day, but this didn't bother us too much. Location of the hotel was perfect! Few min walk to Times square or Central Park, 5th avenue and all the major attractions.The booking desk was very helpful, even booking some restaurants for us and answering our questions and suggesting things to do. There is a Starbucks right next to the hotel and a subway across the road, plenty of other places to eat a few feet from the hotel. We didnt spend a great amount of time in the actual hotel, we knew from the beginning it would just be a place for us to sleep and wash really but we were no way disappointed.There are a lot of negative reports on here but i can truly say that we had a great stay and would not hesitate in coming back here and would defo recommend it to anyone."
301,1889,"Apr 18 2008	Comfortable and Convenient	Date: 4/17/08Reviewers: 2 ladies going to the OperaThe room was very comfortable. I slept very well. The bureau had 6 roomy drawers. The closet was right next to a bed, but that wasn't a real problem. Some problems with the lights and toilet were repaired immediately. There was no view, but the room was very quiet. The ice and coke machines were just down the hall. No coffee maker, but Starbucks was around the corner. Very close to MoMA, not much of a walk to Lincoln Center, but we did get turned around a couple of times coming back. Very near our favorite breakfast place, Sarabeth's with a location now on Central Park. Close to our favorite restaurant at Rockefeller Center, Morrel's. - about 9 blocks. We really only saw the hotel staff except in passing. We did get a good map from the concierge. We didn't use the restaurant, but it looked lovely.Ideally, we'd like a place closer to Central Park, like Jumeirah Essex, (we stayed there once before it was Jumeirah, and it was excellent) but the prices go up accordingly. We loved the Lucerne on 83rd, but we had a little trouble getting back at night - subway directionality problems. We'd go back to the Park Central."
302,1889,"Apr 18 2008	not so great!!!	Having just returned from staying 5 nights at the Park Central, I have to say that I would not recommend this hotel. After an early landing from JFK, we were made to wait until the designated check in time of 4pm, there was absolutely no compromise, we could have opted to put our luggage in the store.... for a charge, but decided against that as eveybody else had the same idea!! We were not given a smoking room as requested, and had to wait until 4pm the next day to change rooms, therefore a chunk of our sightseeing time was lost. We found only one pleasant person on reception, the rest were totally uninterested in us. The rooms were very tired and needed updating, the bathroom was very dark (even with the lights on!), the windows were absolutely filthy, not that the view was anything to write home about!! although it was clean, and the beds were comfortable. We were charged $6 for 2 coffees in the breakfast room (the deli next door charged us $2.50). When we went to print our bording cards for our return flight in the 'business' suite, the machine just ate up the dollars. The location wasn't bad, there is a subway right on the corner. All in all, if you have a choice choose another hotel. I would not stay in this hotel again."
303,1889,"Apr 16 2008 	Great Hotel Central Location Good Value	Very pleased with this hotel. Our first trip to new york and we were delighted with the location which is very central and in a nice area. Service was good, rates were reasonable and room was good - clean, decent decor and well maintained while we were there. The hotel has a decent free gymn, bar and restaurant (which are fairly expensive, but lots of other places nearby).There is a subway stop right by the hotel, and it is a 5 min walk to broadway/fifth avenue and only a few hundred yeards to central park. Based on our stay I recommend park central highly etc."
304,1889,Apr 15 2008 	Besides Location forget it!	Spent 1 night 4/11. The Good:1) Location. Right on 7th avenue. 1 block from Carnegie Hall and the Stage DeliThe Ugly:1) Check in was supposedly at 4. Were not able to obtain room key until 4:20. Took over 10 minutes to get up to the 19th floor. Only 2 of 4 elevator banks were operating. Wife had to change her clothes in a two stall bathroom to avoid being late for a 4:30 meeting!2) Room was very small for over $300 for the night3) Under bed had not been vacumed from prior visitor. 4) Shower wouldn't drain.5) Thermostat on HCAC wouldn't control the temperature any cooler than 73 degrees.6) Light fixtures in bathroom rusted7) Went to check out and have our bags stored so we could grab a bite to eat before we departed NYC. Management would not grant a courtesy voucher to store 2 bags for an hour (even though we had been greatly inconvenienced the previous day). They wanted $3.50 to store the 2 bags.Don't waste your money on this hotel. There are much better ones in NYC!
305,1889,Apr 12 2008 	Great Destination- Bad Service	We were staying the for 6 nights there. The location was very good because you could see times square. When we checked in the staff was rude and finally when we got got our hotel room there were two things wrong. Firstly the sheets of the bed was nasty and the radiatior gave out cold instead of hot air. So we desided to call a person to fix our radiator and ee what was wrong with it. It took the person about 30 minutes to come to ur room (room 405). When he arrived he just said 'wait a minute the radiator needs time to warm up' and we told him that the sheets of the bed were nasty so he called another person up. The person finally came and she said the nastyness of the sheets were' stains. It is a very bad hotel.
306,1889,"Apr 11 2008 	Highly Recommend!!!	Highly recommend this hotel for stays in NYC!! We stayed here for 11 nights in feb 2008 and our experience was fantastic! It is in a very central location, walking distance to 2 main subway line stations, times square, central park, rockafellar centre, great restaurants etc...Rooms were great value for money, we stayed on 23rd floor. Large room and bathroom which were always well cleaned. Large plasma and king size comfy bed, consistent to photos on web. Would recommend to anyone, and will stay here again. Rooms are ready from 4pm, so as we arrived about 2pm, we had to pay for our luggage to be stored this additional charge would be our only complaint."
307,1889,Apr 9 2008 	Great hotel.Would recommend.	This hotel was perfect for our needs.Staff very helpful.Rooms clean.Bathroom good size.Beds very comfy.Great view from window (17th floor)The location is excellant for a first time visit.Right on Broadway just up from Times Square.Easy to find again at the end of a busy day.Next to some excellant diners and deli.Eating out for breakfast was great fun and a real NY experience.Use of internet to check in for return flights.Overall we found this hotel to be excellant value for a city centre base.The MacLeay familyScotland
308,1889,"Apr 2 2008 	central but felt not great for the money.	we stayed at this hotel this year, hotel very impressive on internet and even when we arrived from the front and the foyer, however room disapointing, looking out onto what we could describe as the middle of the hotel just brick walls.there was also no coffee facilites, we saw others going across the road in the morning for a coffee and bringing it back to the hotel, felt this was bad considering the hotel was in our opinion expensive. despite this the hotel ws central, very convienent for transport and something to eat which was ideal for us as we only had a short stay.however the most anoying was that there was one heater in the bedroom and this did not work, at times it was very cold, as it was february.we were going to complain but as we only had two nights stay felt it wasnt worth the hastle, however this was still not exceptable.wouldnt recommend this hotel, especially when there are plenty to choose from that may offer a better service in the area."
309,1889,"Mar 30 2008	Go somewhere else	I was in NY for a conference where colleagues stayed at other hotels such as the Hilton, Sheraton(s) and Marquis; the Park Central was the most expensive and had the least amenities (no coffee-making facilities in the room, Internet was $13 a day -- you can use the wireless network in the Sheraton for free). The service was dreadful; the key to my room didn't work on day 1 so after taking the interminable lift back to the lobby, the new key didn't work either. I asked a passing porter who checked the key and called security to help. Thirty minutes later they hadn't arrived so I went back to the lobby. I was told security were on a shift change. You get the picture. One day the internet wasn't working, the line I was given to call to check the problem suggested I &quot;get the hotel to give me a new cable&quot;. Down I went to the desk only to be told that there had been problems all day and they were aware of it.For the best part of $300-a-day, stay somewhere else, you are wasting your money staying here."
310,1889,"Mar 29 2008	loved park central	park central is a lovely hotel in new york, near central park and within walking distance of times square. it also has a gym which i used each morning. i will return to park central hotel."
311,1889,"Mar 25 2008	This place is just right	I booked this hotel through the website because the price was actually less expensive this way then through any other means.This is the second time we stayed here. The rooms are clean, the staff attentive, the location is really cool- near Carnegie Hall, Times Square and Carnegie Deli. It really was the best price for the amenities that I found. If you like to work out in a hotel gym, this one is pretty nice, clean and free."
312,1889,"Mar 23 2008 	DO NOT STAY HERE	I booked a room with 2 Double beds in November 07 for Mar 08 in this Hotel, but when we arrived they had no rooms of that type available so we were put into a room with 1 King Bed, this would not work. I contacted the Manager who was not very helpful and we were put into a slightly larger room with 1 King Bed for the 1 night. The next day I contacted the manager again to get moved into the room which I booked orginially and was told that none would be available until 4pm and that we must check out of our current room before 11am which left us with no room for half the day. The room we stayed in on the first night did not cost as much as the room book orginally but the Hotel would not refund the difference....this does not make sense. The breakfast is very over priced at approx $30 per head?????????. Do not believe a word the Manager/Reception Staff/Doormen tell you........it will only end up costing you more and benefit the Hotel Staff in some way. This Place is an Overpriced B&amp;B who employ Thieves in suites.............."
313,1889,"Mar 18 2008 	An unfortunate incident...	We called the hotel to book the room and were able to reserve a room with two double beds for a great rate of 129-99/night (depending on wkday or wkend). When we arrived, the hotel did not have the room we wanted available so we had to go into a room with a single King bed which did not work for us at all and had to order a cot brought into the room. This change made the room extremely tight. The plumbing was awful so there was no pressure in the shower. Moved to a better room the next day but when we went to pick up the car, we noticed the radio had been tampered with, there were magazines in the car that did not belong to us and money was stolen from the locked glove compartment! Complained to the hotel but management replied that they were not responsible for what the parking attendants did since they don't work directly for the hotel (externally contracted). This last one may be our fault, left an expensive coat and pair of uggs in a bag in the room right before checkout and called back to see if it was retreived...of course they weren't. The only great thing about the stay was the location of the hotel. It was close to everything we wanted to do in the city."
314,1889,"Mar 16 2008 	We loved this hotel	My husbands co-worker recommended this hotel for our trip at Christmas time. My husband booked it and then we looked at the on-line reviews and were a little worried. Fortunately our experience was great, contrary to some of the negative reviews we read. The staff at the hotel was courteous, our room immaculate, and the location was superb for our first visit. Our room was fairly large, quiet and extremely comfortable. The furnishings were lovely, flat screen tv, and a comfortable bed with down pillows. I would hate to see someone stay away from this hotel based on the other bad reviews, because our experience was so good. The location is a huge plus, but you don't have to give up any comfort to stay here. Central Park is just two blocks away, there is a subway entrance just outside the hotel, Rockefeller Center and Time Square are a few blocks away. And the price was unbeatable for the quality of what we got. I would recommend this to anyone, and would stay here again."
315,1889,"Mar 16 2008 	Great stay at the Park Central New York Hotel	Despite the many negative reviews of this hotel, we had a great time during our 5-day stay. Our &quot;superior&quot; room was very large by normal standards with additional room that could have a further queen-sized bed. Check-in was completed without any trouble and took probably less than two minutes from entering the hotel lobby. All the staff were very efficient and eager to please (this is the USA after all). Our room was next to the emergency staircase which meant it was probably larger than normal (room number X57 where X = floor number is probably worth asking for,). This hotel is in an excellent location being only a few blocks from 5th Avenue, Rockfeller Center etc. and next to 57St subway station. The hotel has a limosine service to the airports (JFK - $60) which we shared with other hotel guests. We would definitely return."
316,1889,"Mar 11 2008 	great location!	After planning our visit to New York for months we finally deceided to go fot the Park Central. We were not disapointed. We knew not to expect 5 star luxury as you dont go to New York and stay in your hotel when there is so much to do. You cannot check into your hotel room till 4pm, they did offer us another room if we really couldnt wait but we just left the luggage with the hotel and came back after 4.The room was pleasant, clean and the bed is THE comfiest we have ever slept in, it was amazing!!!!The best thing about this hotel is the location though, 2mins walk to central park, 5 mins to 5th Avenue, 5 mins to Times Square and you are literaly on Broadway.There are plenty of deli's, pizza places, starbucks and stores nearby so you are never going to go hungry!We found Fluffys deli, across the road, was wonderfull and alot cheaper than BenAsh deli next door. Rays pizza is also awesome, massive slices of tasty pizza!!!If you are planning on going to New York for the shopping and the sights than i recommend this hotel as it is reasonably priced and has a brilliant location!!"
317,1889,"Mar 10 2008 	great hotel great rates great location	The hotel is steps away from Central Park, a few blocks from Broadway, right beside Carnegie Hall. If you want to see the city, this is the place to stay. I could not believe the price: $110,00 walk-in rate. However, if we had booked the hotel through the internet, we would have gotten also breakfast included. You can have internet access for $12.00/24 hrs.The hotel is clean, furniture is modern and the staff friendly. Good food in the restaurant. Lots of restaurants in the area."
318,1889,"Mar 9 2008 	Disappointing service great location	First, the good: The property's location is primo -- 57th &amp; 7th -- catty-corner from Carnegie Hall, just blocks from Central Park and walking distance to Times Square, Fifth Avenue shopping, great restaurants and more. The well-equipped fitness center is a plus, and includes ellipticals, stationary bikes, treadmills, Nautilus weight machines and free weights. I booked a superior king room on Expedia and was very disappointed upon arrival to be put in a standard double room on the 7th floor. My neighbors were noisy -- to the extent I needed to wear earplugs -- and then when I returned to the hotel midday after some business meetings were over, was dismayed by how noisy the housekeeping staff was. I was also a bit annoyed to find housekeeping had taken shortcuts -- not replacing glasses, for instance, but putting new covers on them (toothpaste residue told the tale.) Internet connectivity costs $12.95 a day and was slow -- I was double-charged for each day upon check out, but that was quickly resolved. None of the typical amenities such as in-room coffee maker, etc., but the decor was spare and elegant, everything was clean and my stay was ok. I just didn't feel as if the staff was willing to do whatever it took to care for guests. When compared to similar properties where I've stayed in midtown -- the Hilton Garden Inn in Times Square and the Comfort Inn Manhattan, I wouldn't return. On the other hand, it's not a bad property at all."
319,1889,"Mar 8 2008 	Excellent choise	This was our second stay at this Hotel (4 nights). It was included as part of a flight/hotel package we found on Expedia. For a mid-town NY hotel, and at the price (est. $175 night), it is an excellent choice. We had a large room, well furnished and well maintained. The Park Cafe across the street is very good for breakfast. The is a subway entrance on the side of the property (55th St)."
320,1889,"Mar 6 2008 	An okay choice	We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights when we got in there was no queue line but the staff was quite rude and when we went to our room we had a great view of a brick wall and some of the wallpaper was peeling off on some electrical outlets.The room was a bit small also, the location though was great because it was a very close walk to Time Square (Less than 5 mins) and Central Park( about 10 mins) overall the hotel was a pretty average hotel."
321,1889,"Mar 6 2008	Good value and good sized rooms	This is a belated review but I have only just discovered this website ! I have stayed twice at the Park Central and think it is very good value for money compared to a lot of the other hotels in NYC. Both times I have stayed I have had a good sized room at a fair price. Service is polite if not exceptional but the location is great - walkable to Central Park, Times Square, MOMA etc etc. There is a tourist bus stop directly outside as well if you choose to see the city that way."
322,1889,"Mar 5 2008 	Great hotel location clean but slow lifts!	This hotel was better than I expected, the room was a great size for NY and was v clean. staff were all friendly, and the restaurant had great food for dinner one night when we were too tired from shopping! v close to central park, and 5th avenue / times sq both only about a 5-10 minute walk away. rooms were quiet which was great for a good nights sleep!downside was lifts were terribly slow, and the stairs were not well laid out - no sign to say ground floor - but the lifts are under construction so should be ok soon. concierge staff were all great, v helpful, and brilliant tips for where to get good reasonable food nearby - we were recommended a fabulous little italian place off times sq, def going back! best meal of the week, wish we'd used their advice more!"
323,1889,"Mar 2 2008 	Perfect	We stayed at the Park Central while on our honeymoon in NY. The hotel is situated perfectly in the heart of midtown Manhattan, which means within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, the list goes on and on. It is also convenient to the subway to make a quick jaunt down or uptown. The service and cleanliness was great and we would definately stay here again."
324,1889,"Mar 1 2008 	Central Park Central	I must have spent the best part of 2 full days researching hotels in New York. While we were on a budget, I also didn't want to end up in a dive!!I decided on the Park Central because of the location and the price, I booked direct through the web site and managed to get a king room for just over $200 a night which was right at the top end of our budget. After I'd booked it, I was worried about some of the reviews about service and the state of the rooms and considered several times if I should pay a bit more or take a hotel further out from Manhattan.In the end I decided to stick with the hotel as most hotels have good and bad reviews and at worst we could check out after a night.So, on to the hotel!!We checked in about 7pm on Saturday, no queues and the guy (Chris) was quite chatty and welcoming.We got in the lift (no queues here either) and went up to our room on the 9th floor.The room was big and as clean as any hotel we'd stayed in before. The bathroom was also as big as you'd expect and quite new and very clean, shower was fine with the usual bottles of shampoo and bars of soap, box of tissues etc.The bed was HUGE and very very comfy! Plenty of pillows, sheets and blankets. Good sized room safe which was free plus an iron and board. All in all, everything we needed.Our room was inside facing so no view but that meant it was very quiet and we slept well after a day in the city on our feet.The location is, as others have said, fantastic. There is a subway station right outside the hotel which was the best way to get around (we wished we'd bought a 7 day pass as this would have saved us money) There's a wide range of places to eat all around the hotel, from restaurants to diners to delis at all hours of the day, our favourite was the Applejack Diner for breakfast, about $15 to $20 for 2 of us.We couldn't fault the housekeeping, our room was cleaned and tidied well each day, clean towels etc. for which we left a tip.When we checked out the guy was a bit surly but all was done quickly with no billing issues.So, to sum up and based on our stay;I found what I was looking for (not too expensive but not a dive), great location to explore the city, I'd stay there again and recommend it to family or friends."
325,1889,Feb 28 2008 	Check That Billing !	We found the hotel a little better than adequate. The rate was good; too good to be true apparently. When we got our bill from AMX there was a $ 99.00 addition under micellaneous.After the torture of trying to find someone to talk to on the phone we were told it was a &quot;fumigation fee&quot; because someone had smoked in the non-smoking room we requested.Interesting. My partner and I are NON-SMOKERS.We are now in the process of having our doctors supply affidavit that we are in fact non-smokers to AMX. I would rather have paid the additional $99.00 to stay in a better hotel and avoid the time and energy we are spending to fix this little mess.Next time we will.
326,1889,"Feb 26 2008 	Nice Place good location	We booked out hotel stay thru JetBlue and we really liked it. We had 5 people traveling with us and the hotel was only for only 4 people. instead of paying or upgrading we just had 1 person lounge in the lobby and after check in and after all was all said and done we all just went to the room. Needless to say we all rotated on the floor the 5 nights we were there. The service was great and really no complaints. The place was really clean and had a real nice upscale appearence. We were able to get our room on &quot;E-rate&quot; for around $167.00 a night, which was a great deal"
327,1889,"Feb 25 2008 	Amazing!!	Just returned back from staying 5 nights at The Park Central Hotel. I was a bit worried as i was checking trip advisor after i booked and there were loads of bad reviews, but i should never have worried. Hotel is fab, check in was very quick we arrived at about 4.30pm, i must admit the reception staff are miserable its like they are making a effort to be nice, but didn't worry me as long as the rooms were nice.We stayed on the 17th floor and had a great view of Times Square. Rooms were large, bathrooms on the small side but had a very powerful shower. Rooms were very clean and warm. we never ate or drank in the hotel so can't comment on these. The location of the hotel is fantastic, 5 minutes walk into times square a couple of minutes to central park and another 5 minutes to all the shops. would recommend going to Soho we only found it on our last day had great shops there. Would recommend the park central for anyone who wants to stay near broadway and times square."
328,1889,"Feb 24 2008	Can't wai to go back!!!	Just back this morning from a 6night stay in this hotel, I would highly recommend it to anybody going to new york and i will definitly be returning! Location was ideal, to the right was time square (fantastic view from our room, 16th floor), to the left was central park and straight ahead was 5th avenue (abercrombie &amp; Fitch, tiffenys etc., just two blocks away). Subway station right beside the hotel, they are so safe and fast, we travelled everywere on them. The room was gorgeous, so clean and fresh!!! It was very cold in the room all the time! However as we never reported this to staff we have our self to blame! After a busy day when we returned to the room it was always tidy, clean and bed made, exactly what you need after a day of shopping! Ive never slept in a more comfortable bed, we sank into it every night. I hav absolutly no complaints about the hotel, i will definitly return! one thing you should be aware of, when we were leaving the hotel the door man insisted on getting us a taxi, this was fine but he then brought us around the side of the hotel were black car's are waiting to bring you to the airport, they are independent drivers and will charge you a fortune! we changed our mind at the last minute and went with a yellow cab as a set rate to the airport was stated on the outside of the taxi - always use the YELLOW CABS!!!!On the first day or two i reccommend you get on the tour bus around downtown (depending on the sites you want to see). It is a great holiday and i cant wait to return!!!"
329,1889,"Feb 21 2008 	Great rates nice rooms great location	I've stayed about 25 nights in the last few months at the Park Central Hotel. It is in a great location for tourists, as well as the many office buildings nearby. It has entrances on 3 sides, making it much nicer to get in and out when its snowing or a cab drops you off on the wrong end...The rooms are large for NYC. Bathrooms are decent sized - I've had varying sizes... The rooms are somewhat modern, comfortable, and clean. The views are meh/ok, better if you're above 18-20th floor and facing south (times sq).I generally find their rates to be $30-60 cheaper per night than nearby hotels. The only negative things I can say is no free internet (but I've yet to find anywhere in NYC with that), and the elevators are slow. Slow as in, I've taken the stairs from the 8th floor down slow.... apparently they're working on them."
330,1889,"Feb 21 2008	Just right!	This hotel was in a perfect location. Some of the staff were a little unfriendly but in contrast others were very helpful. The only thing I would fault is the carpets were a little dirty and the wallpaper was peeling. We were given a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking but they happily moved us to a much better room the next day.All the cafes around the Hotel are great. For shopping I definitely recommend Soho, we made the mistake of sticking around 5th Avenue which is much more expensive. We discovered Soho on out last day so if you're there for shopping go there first! H&amp;M is brilliant - they have 2 and it's all so cheap it's unbelievable.I also recommend the Sex and the City Tour if you like the programme, it's so much fun and you see a a different side to New York.I had a great stay, loved the food, the people, the hotel, the atmosphere. Definitely recommend this Hotel!"
331,1889,"Feb 20 2008 	Very good choice	Very good balance between price and quality.We stayed for four nigths at this hotel. It has a perfect location. Few steps from the metro and a short walk to Central Park and Time Square. They have a lot of choices around the hotel for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The rooms were clean, reasonable comfort and all those basic things.In our next trip to NY, for sure de Park Central Hotel would be our first choice."
332,1889,"Feb 19 2008 	Recommend...	We had been recommended this hotel and we were not let down. The location is brilliant, just seconds from Central Park, and around 5-10 mins walk from many of the key attractions. The room was better than we expected, great size, clean. Would definitely recommend."
333,1889,"Feb 13 2008 	new york new york	we stayed for 3 nights in jan and must say we had a lovely stay with no poblems. There were no queues at check in and our room was ready on arrival even though we were 3 hours early for check in, room was nice and clean with 2 large double beds no complaints about the bathroom either....didnt eat in the hotel but did have a few drinks in the bar...which were expensive. Theatre tickets are usually cheaper if u buy them directly from the box office where the show is we got tickets for our show front row for $26.50 each...we basically just went to shop and enjoy new york and not to sit around in our hotel looking for faults we got an excellent price for the location which we booked on the hotel website...had already stayed in fitzpatricks grand central but this beats it for a cheaper alternative and will def go back again to this hotel next year."
334,1889,"Feb 12 2008 	Another Great Stay	We stayed at the Park Central Dec. 16th-20th. This was my second stay at this hotel - the first being in 2002. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but once again, it was a great stay. Our flight was canceled due to weather so we called to let them know we would be checking in later than planned. The person on the phone &amp; the lady at check-in were both very helpful. We had a very clean, nice-sized room on the 6th floor. It was cleaned/straightened daily &amp; always restocked with plenty of towels (it does make a difference when you tip for a job well done). Yes, the elevators were slow at times, but it was never a problem for us...it gave us a chance to rest our aching feet after the miles of walking we had done! The location is perfect!! I have recommended the hotel to friends &amp; will definitely stay there again the next time I am in NYC."
335,1889,"Feb 12 2008 	Wonderful Stay.	We all have different expectations when it comes to hotels. My wife and I stayed at The Park Central in late January. As others have said, the locations was absolutely great. Unlike others, however, our stay was fine. No staff member was rude, the concierge went out of thier way to help us, the room was very clean, and there were never lines for the elevators. I even spoke to the person who was to clean our room and she was very kind. I left a tip every day and our room was cleaned to above most standards. We didn't use the restaurant or the bar, so I can't comment on them. Overall, no, it isn't a five star hotel, but I wasn't paying five star prices either. take the comments with a grain of salt and don't be affraid to stay at the Park Central. It was a very pleasant stay."
336,1889,Feb 10 2008	Not to Par with Price	I have to say that through all my travel this hotel has been the most dissapointing yet. I arrived on Sunday only to find that my rooms wallpaper is literally pealing off the wall. The bathroom is small and the door seems to have a problem staying open by itself. What should have been a dign for me was the horrible smell that is all over the hotel with the exception of the check in area. I will honestly admitt that I do not think that I will return to this hotel. There are signs posted that they are remodeling but I think that they should hurry up and finish. with the price that they charged me to stay here I could have easily been staying at a very very good hotel.Upset Guest!
337,1889,Jan 31 2008	Orrible Service!	I stayed there for one week. After a long line at ceck in...first room they gave me was not cleaned yet (!) in the second room a couple has just cecked in right before me (!!) third room toilet did not flush (!!!)
338,1889,"Jan 29 2008	Great experience	great hotel, unfriendly front desk staff, but nice concierge and bellmen. good location and clean and love the fitness center. would definitely go back! walk everywhere- so close to everything"
339,1889,"Jan 25 2008 	Not Not Not	Really bad, incompetent staff, rooms not really good. Is not good value for money.I got charged in my credit card twice and a nightmare to solve it."
340,1889,"Jan 25 2008 	Pretty Average !!	Our first trip to New York so can only compare with hotels elsewhere.Arrived at 8:30pm on a Saturday night for 4 night stay to be told that the room would not be ready for a further hour !!!Finally got into the room and basically crashed out after being up for 18 hours.In the morning was awaken by a whining noise, eventually finding the source to be a service elevator drive room adjacent to our room. On checking the room found the toilet damaged, the doors of the wardrobe and bathroom in need of lubrication. The wallpaper was damaged in both bedroom and bathroom. There was a rusted vent cover over the window and the curtain bracket was damaged.I asked at the front desk for a change of room which was addressed immediately. The new room was excellent with a very comfortable bed and plenty of space and a large TV.I'm not sure if it's standard in New York hotels that there are no coffee making facilities but I found it strange to see so many people going to Starbucks next door and then queue for the lifts to take the drinks back to the room !!!As stated in previous reviews the location makes the hotel."
341,1889,"Jan 23 2008 	Dirty hotel incompetent staff	I was here on a business trip Jan. 19-22. Though the room had already been paid for by my company, hotel staff couldn't understand that, or why the name on my credit card didn't match my company name. After waiting two hours for check-in, and having to pay to stow my luggage in the interim, got that problem straightened out. Had corner room on concierge level (1806), which was decent size and great view. However, aside from the bed, which was comfortable, the room was filthy (floor not vacuumed, bathroom not mopped, etc). The hotel is very run-down, and it feels like a Days Inn marketing itself as a Waldorf Astoria. On checkout, despite the fact the room was paid for, charged my credit card (given for incidentals) $600 for the room. Have filed dispute on charges, but who knows when/how that will be resolved. Manager attempted to rectify the problem on credit card billing, and provided me a car to LaGuardia on the hotel's dime upon checkout, but told me that the billing problem was something that &quot;[I} would just have to get over.&quot; He honestly said that. You may pay more at other hotels, but it is worth the expense. This hotel is awful. Skip it."
342,1889,"Jan 22 2008 	Fabulous location	Stayed 3 nights in early Jan on pleasure trip with my wife and two daughters (21 and 18). Very impressed with hotel location - just 10 mins walk from Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and 5th Ave. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the staff helpful and friendly. Yes the hotel could do with a little sprucing up and new lifts, but if you're not spending all day there it's just fine. Rooms are comfortable (large for a city hotel, I thought), and very clean. Plenty of delis and restaurants nearby give plenty of eating options. Would recommend Angelo's Pizzeria on 57th Street down by Carnegie Hall, and breakfast at Carnegie Deli in next block to hotel (although I believe other delis nearby are also good). Overall, a very good experience."
343,1889,"Jan 22 2008 	Fabulous	We just got back last night from a 4 day stay in NYC. After reading some of the reviews online about this hotel, I was skeptical.....however, everything was great! The location is perfect for shopping, times square, museums and the subway. The hotel lobby is beautiful and the staff was great (especially Michael). The rooms were big for NYC and clean. Housekeeping came everyday. There is a nice restaurant, bar and gift shop in the hotel, not to mention that Carngie and Stage Deli are next door. I would definitely stay here again.If you are visiting NYC with kids....check out Spotlight Live in Times Square. Great Kareoke with back up singers. My kids had a blast."
344,1889,"Jan 21 2008	Not bad for a Three Star Hotel in Central New York	Just got back from a 4 night stay here (we booked through the hotel's own website having got flights with lastminutedotcom) and were impressed with the location. You're 15mins walk from Central Park and 10mins the other direction from Times Square - ideal for tourist travellers like us. Right outside are guys in yellow anoraks selling tickets for city bus tours - get the $49 all-round town trip and ask them to make it for 3days - we did this and toured uptown (inc Harlem) one day, downtown (inc SoHo) the next and Brooklyn the final day. Great value and you can hop on and off.The hotel staff were pretty unfriendly but that seems typical of NYC. Our room was non-smoking but smelt of smoke as you walked in - not enough to be a problem though unless you had an allergy to cigarette smoke. Reasonable size room but only a 30cm gap between end of the bed and a tv table so you need to be slim or climb over the bed if you're sleeping on the left!Good bathroom - not luxurious but provided 3 hand towels, 4 bath towels and two face flannels as well as shampoo, body lotion and bar of soap. Didn't eat at the hotel as it looked expensive and there are loads of places to eat within 1min. Check prices outside the eateries though as they vary A LOT - we paid $50 one night for a burger and a wrap, a coke and one beer which was a rip off. One thing about NY this time of year - take the warmest clothes you have and wear a hat, gloves, scarf, thermal underwear and 3 pairs of socks all the time or you'll freeze; it's unfunny how cold the place is."
345,1889,"Jan 19 2008 	Room 705 - bathroom freezing	Rooms not available on check-in. Had to wait over 1 hour for room to be cleaned.Room 705 - spacious and comfy bed, BUT bathroom was absolutely freezing with icy draft through windows.Reception staff/duty manager - not very helpful. Gave impression that they just wanted to get rid of you.Breakfast good and good location.Would not use again."
1,1892,Jan 8 2007 	Great for long term stay (2 years)	Been there for 2 years while studying in NY. i got the apt 711 and I must say that it beats any other buildings in term of services and location (2 steps from colombus circle where my university was).Maid service available at any time. Balducci is just down the building. Jsut across the street
2,1892,Nov 21 2005	A great base in NY	I've stayed here a couple of times recently
3,1892,Apr 12 2005	Great comfort and space	We loved the Phillips Club. Our one bedroom apartment with full kitchen was bright
4,1892,Nov 28 2004	Classy but pricey conference venue - excellent NY location	Resided at the Philips Club throughout a five day conference for Enicore Capital earlier this month
5,1892,Nov 17 2004	a little disappointing	After reading the reviews here I was a bit disappointed at the Phillips Club. We spent two weeks there while apartment hunting and I found the reception staff almost uniformly unpleasant
6,1892,Jul 26 2004	Love staying they	My parents and I love staying at the Phillips Club. We stay there almost everytime we go up. We usually take a 1 bedroom and I sleep on the couch. We like the fact that we don't step over each other in 1 room. Also we like the fact that there are two televisions and a kitchen. It helps especially in the mornings since we don't like big breakfast.	
7,1892,Jun 3 2004	Favorite place to stay...	We have stayed at the Phillips Club twice in the last couple of years. I have stayed at a lot of places in NYC and this is by far the best yet. It's extremely clean and in great condition
8,1892,Nov 17 2003	Second to none	Without question
9,1892,Oct 29 2003	Wonderful place	The Phillips Club is first rate in every respect. I had to laugh when I read the above review. That &quot;Italian grocery store&quot; is Balducci's. Arguably the finest gourmet shop in NYC. Their flagship store is attached to the Phillips Club lobby. Many Manhattanites travel a good distance to shop there. Do not miss the many varieties of smoked salmon
10,1892,Aug 28 2003	Loved the Phillips Club	I loved the Phillips Club. We stayed in a suite and it was delightful to have the Italian Grocery store next store
11,1892,Feb 10 2009 	Semplicemente perfetto		
1,1894,Great location good restaurant clean rooms.	We enjoyed our stay at the Martinique as first time visitors to New York from New Zealand - it was central to everything we wanted to do and everyone was very helpful. We ate in the restaurant for the three nights we stayed in New York and the meals were great. Especially enjoyed being able to get a meal at 11.30pm after having been to a show on Broadway. Would definitely stay there again.
2,1894,"Nov 18 2009 	shopping in nyc	HI I have just returned from a four night stay here with friends. the hotel its self was very nice, the staff were helpful and it was very clean. we had an exxperience of a man trying to get into our room at 11pm, this was very distressing for three girls travelling alone. the staff took ages to answer our distress call which was not reassuring. the man in question was later found on cctv however we did not feel satisfied with the responce of the head of security. he assumed we were cabin crew!! and that room hoping was normal!! i would stay here again with my husband but not with the girls.the bar was very pricey but hey ur in manhattan what do u expect, the breakfast menu is vey limited eggs eggs and more eggs."
3,1894,"Nov 6 2009 	Much better than we imagine	We read the reviews about this hotel, some good, some bad, but it had an average postion at Trip Advisor, then we decided to go.Staff works well, excellent location, rooms clean and comfortable. There is WIFI (free at 56k) but does not work with iPhone. Sometimes hard to find a place at internet room, close to lobby. But they were expanding the area (at least they bought tables...).Curious case: I forgot my cell phone (an iPhone) at internet room and I remembered 2 hours later. Someone found it and gave it back to front desk. We heard about some cases of stolen things in other review, but I have to say the guests and staff were very honest.Really fine, this place was perfect for us."
4,1894,"Nov 3 2009 	Disappointed	Our research indicated that your hotel provides a good location and 3 star rated accomodations. However, when we checked in, we noticed that the hotel and our room was not very updated. In addition, the bathroom lacked ventilation (no fan), the shower and tub drained water very slowly, the towel hanger was rusted, and the bathroom door was very old and needed repainting.Because of these problems with the bathroom, we believe that insects were breeding in the drain area. Specifically, my daughter was bitten on the cheek by a large mosquito in the room and my husband had to kill the insect by swatting the mosquito on the ceiling. We were very upset to find a mosquito in our hotel room and my daughter has been suffering with a cheek wound that has not fully healed in over 2 weeks."
5,1894,"Nov 2 2009 	Very good Hotel	We spent 5 nights. Well located, within easy walking distance of time square. The staff were helpfull and offer to us a very good room at 01 pm. The room was serviced daily. it was extremely clean, confy beds, large room with LCD tv, no minibar, very good shower. Has a tube station in front of the hotel. I'll saty again!!!"
6,1894,"Nov 1 2009 	Upgraded for Free but Absolute Chaos	I shouldn't complain too much as I was upgraded to an executive suite, but this place was absolute chaos. I stayed two nights for a business trip.When I arrived to the hotel there were a ton of people hanging around in the tight lobby and the concierges were having trouble managing all the luggage. I was a little early arriving to the hotel and my room wasn't ready so I had to check my luggage, which took forever. Once I returned to check in, there was some confusion about my room and they upgraded me, which I appreciated. My co-workers unfortunately got stuck in smoking rooms so I felt very fortunate.Even though I was in an executive suite, it wasn't perfect. The bathroom had an awful rattling sound which sounded like a loose water pipe banging against the wall. I had to shut the bathroom door to the bedroom to keep it from bothering me. The internet was terrible and I should have complained about paying $13 for the unreliable service. The TV also had a flaky signal and it made watching Sportscenter in the morning pointless. My co-worker also staying at the hotel complained about the flaky signal he was having with his TV.Checking out of the hotel took forever. The lobby was packed with tons of people again and the concierges were overwhelmed with managing all the bags. Give yourself at least 15-20 minutes to check out.The location for the hotel is fantastic, right below the Empire State Building. Overall though, I feel that for the price paid that there would be more organization and a more enjoyable stay."
7,1894,"Oct 26 2009 	Radisson NY- Comments	This was recommended to me but very bad experience.Good- room clean &amp; tidyBad- too hot &amp; could not control temperature, restaurant food terrible though was informed hotel did not own restaurant. Had to move rooms at 2am as heating (storage heater) broke down &amp; started smelling. Then moved to another room where heating then had to be 'fixed' while we waited at 2am!!!! No apology until we were leaving &amp; to make it up we were offered lunch in restaurant which we did not accept due to above. Room quiet small considered class of hotel."
8,1894,"Oct 19 2009 	Fabulous Service	We arrived at 6:00am on a Saturday morning fully expecting to drop our bags and do some sight seeing until check-in. The desk clerk noted that since the reservation was made with AMEX card she could check us in now. WOW!! Got to the room (18th floor) and it was very nice. Room was clean, orderly and well equipped. All service personnel were very kind, helpful and made our stay a great experience.Thanks Radisson....your people ar tops!"
9,1894,"Oct 16 2009 	Very nice hotel in a good location and fantastic breakfast	We went to New York for Easter, I was looking at lots of hotels as I wanted to stay somewhere nice and to have a good time. I came across this hotel, they had a special offer at the time, so we had a Club level room with breakfast included. We stayed there for 4 nights and paid about 500 for the whole stay. i believe it was very good price for New York and for such a spacious room.we liked everything about this hotel except the room was not ready then we arrived at about 11.30 pm, but the receptionist offered us free drinks at the bar while we waited. during weekend room has not been cleaned twice so we had to ask for it which was not really pleasant but i have asked for late check out, so they kindly agreed us stay in the room till 5pm as an opology for the late cleaning.As I mentioned the breakfast was excepcionally good and pancakes just fantastic!we had a dinned twice a pasta dished were just lovely.Overall we had enjoyed the stay there and definitely would go back."
10,1894,"Oct 15 2009 	Great Location Great Service Great Hotel	We stayed here for a week. it was ideally situated for shoping at Manhatten. within easy walking distance of time square and the empire state building. the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly, we were checked in straight away. all our requests were attended to immediately. The room was serviced daily. it was extremely clean and comfortable, very welcoming after a long day of sightseeing. I would definately stay at this hotel again."
11,1894,"Oct 15 2009 	Radisson Martinique on Broadway	I stayed there already several times because our company has an agreement with them. The hotel is in a very good location when you want to go shopping or sightseeing: Macy's, J.C. Penney, Victoria's Secrets ... and the metro are just around the corner. The lobby is quite small and often very crowded especially when a flight crew arrives or leaves. There is a room next to the lobby with a few computers for internet that one can use for free (limit 15 minutes). The rooms are very tiny but clean. In the rooms I stayed in the beds were always small for American everage (they seem to be smaller than Queen size). Size of bathrooms vary."
12,1894,Oct 9 2009 	Best hotel I've stayed at for the price	I booked a few months in advanced and stayed for 5 nights for an average price of $90 a night. Can't beat that price.. Hotel is across the street from Macy's. Great location. Arrived a bit early and the person that checked me in was able to get me a room @ 1pm when their regular check in time is 3pm. Very friendly staff. The room was bigger that what I thought. The bathroom was huge and the beds were sleep by number. People take towels when they go on vacation I wanted to take the bed and pillows. Loved it! Will stay there again.....
13,1894,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Hotel	Service was excellent. My nephew and I did the city for 48 hours. Our home base was the Raddison Martinique. Great location, right outside were the subways, walking distance to Penn Station and many tourist attractions, one block from Empire State Building. Resturant on the premises and we had a great breakfast from room service.Rooms were clean, beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in away from home."
14,1894,"Oct 5 2009 	Great hotel kind staff excellent service and outstanding location....	My husband and I spent 7 days on the hotel - celebrating our 25th weddinganniversary.We arrived around 13.30, and the room was ready - it only took a few minutes to check in.We've got a nice, clean and BIG room - and it was very silent there. Difficult to imagine, it was located in the middle of the crowded New York.Location is perfect - in walkingdistance to everything, the staff is very helpfull, especially in the little giftshop, where they made different bookings for us, such as the helicopterflight. And always ready for a kind word.The breakfast is good, with various choises, and nomatter if you arrive after 10.00, there are plenty of food - fresh food.We would certainly recommend this hotel, AND come back ourselves, if we go to New York again.When I read some of the bad reviews, I wonder, if it is the same hotel, we visited..... or, if people in common are so very different, expecting things.....Anyway, the very best recommandations from me about this hotel."
15,1894,"Sep 26 2009 	Very satisfied with the Radisson Martinique	We arrived at 3pm after 7 hour flight from Manchester and because we'd read the previous reviews and also a colleague had experienced a delay when checking in, we were prepared for our room not being ready. We asked for an upgrade and were immediately issued with a room card. Unfortunately when we opened the door to the room on the 5th floor, the lights were all on because the window faced onto a brick wall some three feet away so there was zero natural light. We immediately returned to Reception and refused the room. At this point, we were informed we'd have to wait until after 4 for another room. We did a pre-check in, room number allocated, details taken and told to return to collect the key card later. We left our luggage with the concierge and went out to explore. Returning at 5, there was no queue and we were issued with our new room card. No problems with this room - it was on the 11th floor and faced the front street. We booked a room with 2 double beds and this is what we got. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean with flat screen TV. Beds were very comfortable and the maid service was excellent. Towels changed every day and toiletries replenished daily. We found the staff on Reception, Concierge, Maids and door staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The free Internet service in the business area was greatly appreciated and we made good use of this facility to research and book attractions etc. Although there are only 3 computers, guests are requested to use for a maximum of 15 minutes and we found that people adhered to this. I have to say the room is one of the quietest I've ever stayed in. There was no noise from the room on either side of us, although they were occupied, nor from the corridors or street below. Amazing when we considered we're in the middle of a huge city. We slept very soundly as a result, which is something I never take for granted in a busy hotel. Free newspaper every morning was a nice touch but the complimentary water was only for first morning! We flew into Newark Liberty Airport and caught the train into Penn Station, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and cost half the price of a taxi. We didn't eat at the hotel, but regretted this later as the restaurant seemed very busy and the menu was good value. Definitely worth checking out. As long as you're prepared for a potential wait for your room to be allocated, and willing to be assertive if there is an undue delay (my colleague asked to speak to the manager and the problem was immediately resolved) I can't say anything negative about this hotel at all. We booked our deal on Expedia together with the flight and for 1700 for 2 return flights from Manchester plus 5 nights room only here, we feel it was a good value break. As previously mentioned, a lot of airline staff do stay here and we were initially concerned this may mean some noise and disruption at unsociable hours but we never heard a thing. Would definitely stay here again as the location is within walking distance of the Flat Iron building, Empire State Building, Macy's, and Times Square and Central Park are about 10-15 mins away."
16,1894,"Sep 23 2009 	Run down dirty zero service	This is a fine place if you are considering as an alternative a hostel or some other 1-2 star hotel. Otherwise steer clear. I was upgraded at check in. Given my tiny room with a full size bed (my feet stuck out all night) I am scared to think about what kind of room I would have gotten without the upgrade. Room smelled of cigarette. Sheets didn't seem very clean as they smelled too. Asked them to be changed, but guess what, no one ever answers the phone. After 3rd call, each time letting it ring no joke 30+ times, finally someone answered. When I came back from day's meetings, sheets had been changed, but my iPod had been stolen. Complained. 2 hours later a security guard came to the room and looked under the bed. Said someone would get back to me the next day. Next day, nothing, so I try calling the front desk. Again no answer. Go to meetings and come back. Try calling again. Still no answer. Get up the next morning to check out, call again, still no answer. Crazy. There are so many hotels in NY with better service, cleaner rooms, etc for the $229 I paid here. Go somewhere else."
17,1894,"Sep 21 2009 	Good hotel 	We arrived at the hotel on 3rd September at about 9pm, after a 7 hour journey from London, as well as a big flight delay on top of that. We arrived at the check in desk to be told that our room was not ready, at 9pm at night. I've also seen from other reviews that we are not the only people to be told this! So we wern't very pleased to be told to come back in an hour, as we were exhausted from our journey, as well as the fact that due to the 5 hour time difference, in our heads it was 2am! We came back in an hour to be told the room still was ready, and after repeatedly asking if our room was ready, we were eventually given a better room.This room was very nice, very large, nice and clean, and a nice modern clean bathroom, so no complaints about the room. The only thing I would say is that I'm not sure the room was worth the price we paid. For the price we paid I probably would have expected more, but you definitely couldn't fault the location, on the corner of Broadway, about 5 minutes from the empire state building and Macys, and right next to a subway station.All in all the hotel was great for the 4 nights that we stayed there, and it was all we needed as a young couple exploring New York, but the fact that the room was not ready by 10pm in the evening I thought was a bit much!"
18,1894,"Sep 11 2009 	Who knew business hotels could be this bad!!	As so many other people have reported, I turned up at 7:00pm to find my room not ready. &quot;Come back in an hour&quot; they said. meanwhile, the people in line next to me were back for their 3rd time after being told &quot;Come back in an hour&quot;. I managed to get a room in about 20 minutes after kicking up a stink and calling Garber Travel, who mysteriously booked me into this hotel -- why????? The problem seems to be that double book rooms They have a lot of international flight crews who stay there and many leave in the early evening. Given that, they clearly paying for that day in the room. The hotel then rebooks that room for that night....... except that the room isn't going to be ready until something around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. I can't believe that Radisson operates this way. Meanwhile, the room was less than average. And the ticket I put out on my room door requesting room service breakfast was never picked up... it was still there when I got up in the morning. My bill for the room -- one night -- no extras -- was $549. SCANDALOUS!!! My advice is -- don't stay at this hotel unless you have no other options."
19,1894,"Sep 8 2009 	Fantastic location but make sure you get a good deal!	Absolutely fantastic location - right on top of a subway station and easy walking distance to Penn Station to get to either of the main airports. Also easy to walk to anywhere in midtown Manhattan.I'll admit I got a really, really cheap deal through Expedia and I felt I got a good deal. My room was kind of small, and faced into the interior courtyard of the hotel so the natural light wasn't great. But I figured it was the kind of room they give you when you've booked a bargain rate!Everything was clean and tidy, and the bed was comfortable though, so no complaints at the amount I paid.I arrived early and was allowed to complete &quot;pre-check in&quot; on arrival, and leave my case. When it was time to check in this meant I just had to pick up my key, which worked pretty well. Check in did seem to be very slow for everyone else though. The staff were nice, but they could probably do with another couple of computer terminals behind the desk to speed things up a bit!I would definitely go back, as long as I could find another good deal on the rate."
20,1894,"Sep 8 2009 	Sub-average	The three hand a half star rating this hotel achieved is way too generous. We arrived at about 5pm local time and the check-in process took forever even though there was no queue. Then, the room was very dated and shabby. Also, there was a serious lack of attention to detail with cleaning. And, to make matters worse the smoke detector in my room started announcing 'low battery' about every 30 mins from the middle of the night. I have stayed in lots of the major hotels in New York and this is by far the most disappointing experience. The location is the only redeeming feature."
21,1894,"Sep 5 2009 	Average hotel great location	When I entered the room there were empty shopping bags and water bottles lying around. It looked as if someone had been in the room after it had been serviced. The TV kept switching itself off every few minutes, and even though I reported this it didn't work for my whole stay. The walls seem to be paper thin, as I could hear the very loud guests in the next room.Also, they are refurbishing, and this involves removing fridges and safes from the room, which you can then rent from reception. I really detest this blatant profiteering, a safe at the very least should be available in a room at no extra charge.I would say stay here if you're not fussy about your hotel, and although my stay was ok, I won't stay at this hotel again."
22,1894,"Aug 31 2009	Great location	Just back from a 4-night stay with my mother at Radisson Martinique. Although check-in time was 4PM, when I arrived at 5PM to check in my room wasn't ready (although my mother's was) and I was asked to come back at 6PM. Not great, considering I had booked both rooms 6 weeks earlier! The accommodation was clean and attractive, but the mini-bar and in-room safe was disabled (similarly in my travelling companion's room. Room swipe keys were very temperamental, and maintenance had to be called on several occasions to gain entry. The vending machine on my floor didn't work properly and the ice-machine on my mother's floor didn't work. On the plus side, the location is great - a few steps to subway and a short walk to Macy's. The hotel breakfast was very good and the serving staff very attentive. Doormen very friendly and helpful also. However, the best thing about this hotel is the concierge (Rebecca) who also mans the giftshop in the lobby. She was super friendly and a great source of information on buying tickets for things / attractions / activities / dining / booking taxis etc. Well done Rebecca!"
23,1894,"Aug 30 2009 	Outstanding location good value poor service	Housekeeping and bell desk were very good.The front desk service was poor. Check-in took much longer than it had to. When we checked in there was one employee repeating the phrase &quot;we don't have any rooms with two beds&quot; to the chagrined customers ahead of us. There were two other employees standing there doing nothing. Just poking a computer keyboard. Maybe playing Tetris. Maybe blogging about how much they despise you and me. This level of service will someday be a footnote to history. &quot;Grandpa, tell us again about the hotel employees who would stand around doing absolutely nothing while weary travelers waited to check in?&quot;Luckily there was only one party waiting ahead of us at check-in, so we got our room within 15 minutes. But we barely dodged a group called &quot;Every Employee of Mexicana Airlines.&quot; We saw several flight crews checking in during our stay; I can imagine a very long wait time at check-in if you get caught behind one of them.Also, the staff made no attempt to advise me that I had received a package. They probably received it on Friday. I picked it up Sunday before I checked out. (They did deliver it to my room, which was nice.)Having said all of that, this was an excellent large clean room, very comfortable beds, with a powerful AC system at 32nd and Broadway for about $200/night on a weekend. Excellent value."
24,1894,"Aug 22 2009 	Great hotel. Great rate. Would go back.	Got a great rate on the hotel's own website. Room was very large for New York standards and well maintained. My only fault was check-in was incredibly slow (took over an hour to get my key) and the front desk were rude and unhelpful on check-in, although they were fine on check-out. Maybe I just got a grumpy staffmember. Would go back."
25,1894,"Aug 18 2009 	Radisson on Broadway Ruined Our Vacation	When I reminisce over our recent stay at the Radisson, three words come to mind: rude, unprofessional, and unaccommodating. The hotel manager, Joseph Somenbeck is a poor example for a manager. Rooms Division Manager, Fatena Williams, lacks customer service or professionalism. Our entire stay at the Radisson was horrible, from beginning to end. On Thursday, August 6, 2009, I arrived at the Radisson Martinique formerly called Holiday Inn Broadway. After waiting three hours for check-in, my mother, daughter and I arrived in our room. The room air conditioner was not working. I immediately called the front desk and was informed that Housekeeping would arrive shortly. I placed two additional phone calls and waited a total of one hour before Mike, the engineer arrived. He then informed us that we needed to change rooms because the compressor was malfunctioning. After packing up and changing rooms, the air in the 2nd room went out at 1 am. The night engineer, Ruben, came and repaired the AC unit.The following day when my family and I returned from shopping, we entered the room to find that the TV was not working. Naturally, I called the front desk. I waited 45 minutes for Mike, the engineer, to arrive and tinker with the television only to inform me that he didn't know why it wasn't working. Eventually, Mike discovered that Housekeeping disconnected the cable, and he was able to repair the television. Once again, we were inconvenienced during our stay. When the room was asked to be serviced, the bathroom was either not provided with enough towels or didn't have any towels. The final and most serious incident transpired on August 8, 2009. At 5:30 pm, I requested a new set of keycards from the front desk clerk. I left the hotel at approximately 6:30 to leave for the theater. I returned from the theater at approximately 12:30 am to find that the Radisson front desk employee had given a colleague I knew from Chicago a key to my hotel room. When I entered the room, I discovered her intoxicated and laying over the bed. I immediately went to the front desk and requested to speak to a manager. Thomas Richards, the night manager, spoke with me. During our conversation he requested a Lock and Interrogation report from security. The report was generated and clearly indicated that a Radisson employee issued [--], a mere stranger, a key to my room, 619 in their hotel. As a result of their negligence, items from my luggage are now missing. Radisson breached their contract when they knowingly allowed a unauthorized person access to my room. We could have been seriously hurt or even killed. Fortunately, the evening did not end tragically, but I was unable to sleep because I no longer felt safe in our hotel room. The individual he allowed in our room was intoxicated and urinated all over herself. Simply put, our wonderful evening had abruptly turned disastrous. I informed Mr. Richards that I was requested a full refund totaling $501.05 immediately. He told me that Fatena Williams, Room Division Manager, was the only person who could authorize the refund. I have contacted her a total of six times between August 8 to date, and no one from the Radisson has attempted to call and apologize or rectify the situation. I am infuriated by the Radisson management and their lack of concern and professionalism."
26,1894,"Aug 12 2009 	Great Hotel!	Our family of four recently stayed at the Radisson Martinique on Broadaway and had a great experience. The hotel is located in the heart of midtown close to everything-Empire State, Times Square, Macy's, etc. The subway is right out front! The hotel service was very good. Any issues were dealt with quickly and efficiently. The front desk personnel were helpful. The doormen were always cheerful and knew all the ins and outs of New York. The room was good size and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
27,1894,Aug 11 2009 	Nice place very good value.	This was nice hotel. Clean and comfotable. Good location. A little seedy by night. Friendly service and concierge was very helpfull in attaining a reservation at a local restaurant.
28,1894,"Aug 1 2009 	Good Deal but you get what you pay for	We just left the Radisson Martinique. We stayed just 1 night as we were in NYC for 36 hours. Here are the Pros:-Very close to a subway station which covered most routes you need to get around the city.-Parking available across the street if you are driving-Restaurant on site.The Cons:-Very small rooms-Rooms are being updated and are in need of it.We paid $214 and with that we got: 1 room with double beds, 24-hour parking pass (worth $37), 4 metro cards for 24-hrs (worth $33). Also, when we checked in, they handed me 4 passes for Breakfast which were worth about $48.The hotel itself was fine-small, old and a little chaotic due to lots of airline pilots/attendants coming and going but unless you are willing to pay $400-500 in NYC, this is what you will get."
29,1894,"Jul 29 2009 	Good Hotel near to Time Square	This hotel is nearest to Time Square and Empire State. Good hotels. Comfortable rooms, great breakfast. For sure i'll comeback again."
30,1894,"Jul 28 2009 	A good buy	Yes, this is an older property. Yes, a lot of tourists and flight crews stay here. But our room, while modestly appointed, was clean and the service was prompt. We asked for a rollaway at check-in and when we returned to our room it was there. The bathroom was quite small. But the hotel was perfectly located for our business. A parking garage is directly across the street although you have to do your own parking - no valet parking. If you do park, be sure to get your parking ticket stamped at the hotel front desk, otherwise you will pay more. AND if you drive an SUV or similar car your car will be held hostage in the parking garage until you give the very rude attendant an extra $10 for &quot;oversize vehicles&quot;. We heard no noise at night (tenth floor). Check-in was relarivelt quick and the staff was very courteous. This is not a luxury hotel so if you want to rest and relax in your hotel, get spa services, room service, etc., this is not the place. But if you want a clean, centrally located, reasonably priced hotel, this is a good choice. We paid $159 for a double room, $20 extra for the rollaway. The parking was $47 for 24 hrs (including the rip-off $10 charge).I would stay here again for the location and value."
31,1894,"Jul 13 2009 	Great Location... but	Ok let's get the 'good' out of the way. The location was very handy for our purposes as we intended to utilise the subway and had a side trip that involved Penn St Station planned and we also went up the ESB (doesn't everyone?). The doormen were very helpful and provided clear accurate directions and answers to our queries re subway connections and general points of interest.I must admit that I read about people not having their rooms serviced and didn't really believe it could be that bad, but it was. We stayed 7 nights and for 3 of those nights we didn't have any service for our rooms. We called to request towels on each occasion and were surprised that the front desk staff didn't apologise for the oversight but merely seemed to treat it as par for the course. On another occasion we came back from a full day uptown and found our room was being serviced at about 5.30pm, most unusual we thought.We requested a non smoking room and we believe a very strong smoke smell was present in the room when we checked in. The front desk sent up someone with air freshener, which didn't really help too much but after a few days I think we (unfortunately) got used to it.Would we recommend this hotel? Location yes, rate yes (at least for our booking, door / bell staff yes, front desk staff - jury is still out, not the friendliest ones around, domestic / cleaning staff...no way. Overall, a very reserved yes providing you can get a really good rate to make up for the other deficiencies."
32,1894,"Jul 12 2009 	Great location	I had the opportunately to stay at this hotel during the 4th July celebrations. Checked in early and and my room was ready for us. The staff were very friendly, professional and helpful. The room was very clean, the bed was very confortable even though I didn't stay in it very long and I had a view of the Empire State Building. Loved the soap, shampoo and lotion in the bathroom and especially the soft and fluffy white towels. I am very picky about towels. The location was perfect midway between Uptown and Downtown. Subway outside the door. Walking distance to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Macys and many restaurants. We had a wonderful full buffet breakfast in the Martinique restaurant. Very good service and the food was very good. If you wanted Eggs &amp; Bacon or go healthy Yorgert and Fruit they had it. Good selection of wine in the bar .I liked the best the friendly staff whom I would talk to and joke with every day in the lobby. The location and the room was the best. I would definely come back to this hotel, very good deal for the price. I have just 1 critic, at the time of my visit the room safes were being overhauled so I was not able to leave my valuables in my room. I called the front desk and they said that I could leave my valuables in their safe. Other than that I really like the hotel. Diane from Montreal, Quebec, Canada"
33,1894,Jun 30 2009 	Very Good	Good clean hotel with friendly staff and comfy room. We have stayed in many Radissons and this was just as good as the others. Easy access to all of the city and very helpful concierges.
34,1894,Jun 29 2009 	Great Spot	Very easy to get to things from the hotel. Our room was lovely must have been refurbished recently. Good selection at breakfast.
35,1894,"Jun 28 2009	Just Perfect !	Spent a week here with my cousin, on a leisure trip, between 20-26 May. First place, excellent location: just between 5th &amp; Broadway, 10 minutes walking distance from Times Square, Penn Station. Theres a subway station just off the hotel !All the crew is very helpful, from the front desk to the belhops...they helped a lot explaining routes, calling cabs, storing luggage, etc. Rooms: Fine - two medium size beds, lcd tv, carpet, regular bathroom. Not big..but enough. Theres a restaurant you can acessa through the front lobby, where you can have breakfast (USD 16/person), grab somthinquick to eat.Theres also a shop in the lobby, where one can get everything from souvenirs, water, soda, snacks, to simple medicine (like aspirin), and even set a car to the airports ! Really helpful !This hotel is perfect for tourists - especially if in large groups - and families not expecting luxury !Would definitely recommend !"
36,1894,"Jun 26 2009 	Not for business travelers	I have stayed at the Martinique twice this month, mainly for the proximity to Penn Station. On my first trip I was awakened at 3am by the guests in adjoining room returning from nightclubs and continuing their party. I called the front desk to complain, and got no answer. Since I could not sleep, I just got up and took an early train. I stopped at the front desk to complain about the noise, and found the associate sleeping in a chair near the front office.On my second trip I arrived around 10pm and found a line of guests waiting to check in, including a full flight crew, whose rooms were not ready. After 30 minutes in line, with both business travelers in line ahead of me being told thier rooms were not ready, I was told the same thing. I accepted a downgraded room, which had a toilet that ran most of the night. The room was not cleaned or made-up during either of the two days in which I was out of the room from 6am to 8pm.I will not stay there again, and would not recommend to any business traveler, especially if you are arriving in NY after a long flight. They seem to cater to flight crews and tour buses, which is fine, except the staff appears to have become indifferent to delivery of service as a means of securing repeat business, and is struggling to keep the lights on. Very surprising for a Radisson chain property."
37,1894,"Jun 23 2009 	Pros and Cons	We stayed here because I found a really great deal on Hotels.com. The Hotel is lovely and has a great location, the subway is right on the corner. The service was ok, we checked in and out at irregular hours so didn't have too bad of a time, although their reservation system was down so there were a few issues. Concierge service was very nice. The first night we requested a couple of extra pillows, which never showed up. The minifridge in the room is being 'converted' so was empty and unavailable for use. Obviously the room was small, but it was comfortable. A couple of things to know. If you are for some reason driving in, parking is offsite (across the street) and costs $37 a day. If you need to get to the airport and there is more than one of you, we strongly suggest avoiding the airport shuttle service through the hotel ($22 per person) and cabbing it instead ($45 flat fee). We were basically dictated to (pretty neurotically, actually, by a crazy lady in the gift shop) what time we had to take the shuttle (which got us to the airport over two hours before boarding), and we ended up being crammed into a van (me squeezed in next to a very smelly eastern European man, I felt like I desperately needed a shower afterward) while the driver had a cell phone to his ear for the hour-long drive. Not a pleasant end to our trip, so please learn from our mistakes. Avoid driving at all costs and take a cab to the airport if you can afford the $45!"
38,1894,"Jun 11 2009 	Good hotel in the heart of NYC	I was here on business so the price was not an issue. I was upgraded to an Executive Room which was nice. It came with the SleepNumber bed which wasn't a selling point to me but it would seem like a nice feature if you have one at home.The room was very clean and the shower had a very high head which is good for us tall people.Fitness center was on the floor below the lobby and was more than adequate for my needs (free weights, 3 treadmills, two ellipticals, hd tv on the wall.)We ate lunch in the Cafe Martinique and the service was achingly slow. We assume this was because they were the kitchen for room service as well (not confirmed, just a guess.) But there are a thousand other places to eat nearby.Overall good experience."
39,1894,"Jun 11 2009 	A Recurring Problem...	I wished I had read the reviews on this website before I made a reservation at this hotel. It seems like everybody seems to report that they were not allowed to check in early (understandable) but when check-in time arrived, had to wait for a room. I share the same story almost four months ago. I checked in early, but was told to return at 4:00 p.m. When I arrived at 5:00 p.m., there was a line that extended to the front door. Although I was previously reserved a room, I was not in my room until 7:00 p.m. after standing in a line for over 2 hours.It seems like my experience was not a one-time occurence but a recurring problem with this hotel. I did notify Radisson Corporate, but received no response. I guess they concur."
40,1894,"Jun 3 2009 	Great location. Small room. But all we needed the room for was sleeping!	Lovely lobby and bar (expensive).Small room - which is apparently to be expected in NYC. Initially we were given a room which had been smoked in, but a quick complaint and we were moved.Room was functional. Bathroom could have done with being a little larger - not much space to swing a cat!Concierge appeared to be very helpful but on more than one occasion their advice was flawed.... we were advised to eat a Keans.... a small restaurant, &quot;averaged priced&quot;, around the corner. $150 later... for 2 steaks (they were fab) and a bottle of wine. We're not sure what level of kickbacks the staff were getting for making these recommendations.....The hotel did offer a great shuttle service back to Newark airport - $20 door-to-door instead of the $15 we'd paid for the train, where we had to lug all out stuff from Penn station to the hotel.Radisson is really well placed - round the block from the Empire State Building and near to the bus stops for the Greyhound open-top buses. And Macy's, of course. Overall a great location and seeing as we didn't really spend much time in the room, it didn't matter that it wasn't that great...."
41,1894,"Jun 2 2009 	check in staff are horrendous	we have just returned from the Martinique, we were eventually pleased with the hotel, we initially attempted to check in at 2pm but were told that we were to early and to return at 4pm, this we done only to find that the desk staff did'nt know if are rooms were ready or not, we were told to sit in the lobby while they found out, after 10 minutes we asked again and got the same reply, after a further 15 minutes we got very angry and demanded any available rooms, on arrival at our room the safe and small fridge were not working, this took three visits to rectify as no one seemed to know how to fix it, we had booked a club room which is bigger than the normal New York room and we were very happy with it, other than it was at the back of the hotel with no view. Check in staff aside the rest of the staff ie cleaning, breakfast, bar and porters were all very pleasant and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here, I would certainly recommend this hotel and with a bit of luck the check in staff will by then have had lessons in good manners"
42,1894,"Jun 2 2009 	Unreceptive unmoved and uninterested - the anti-thesis of hospitality	I stayed at the Radisson Martinique for a night stay. There was no one big incidentthat marred the stay, but rather, the culmination of substandardstaff-guest contact points made me really doubt the professionalism ofthe staff and the sufficiency of training they have undergone.Arriving near noon time, I attempted to check in early but since it wasstill hours before check-in time. I absolutely understood why that I wasnot offered a room. However, I enquired if there was a minibar in the roomwhere I could store my medicine. The lady on duty said there wasnt anybecause the hotel is currently replacing them, without offering anyalternatives or suggestions. I asked if there was a way I could store mymedicine in the propertys restaurant/room service department. She toldme, You can try, but based on my experience, they dont usually do it foryou. I was rather appalled at the unhelpful comment that seemed tochallenge more than assist.When I finally checked in around 5pm, I was glad when I realized I wasbeing assisted by the Duty Manager (Mr Juan). I thought, perhaps, he couldbe a good reference for the service standard of the hotel. Although I washeartened that he offered to place a fridge in my room free-of-charge whenI enquired about storing my medicine, I wondered why there was adouble-standard on this front. More disappointing was perhaps the factthat he did not look at me when talking to me, seemingly more concernedwith the paperwork than welcoming a guest. My preference for a room witha window which I stated upon reserrvation was not reconfirmed with me.Neither was I asked for my preference for a smoking or non-smoking room. Iwas sent on my way to my room with a rather half-hearted thank-you and yetagain, no eye contact.When there was eye contact, the staff seemed to prefer avoiding it ratherthan to engage in it. Mr. Raul from the bell-desk, who saw me holding up aticket for my luggage, almost immediately shifted his glance to somethingelse, ignoring my presence and walking past me. Hence, I walked up toanother bellman for help. At the Financial Center, I could not believe myeyes when the staff on duty did not even lift his head up to address me,when I enquired about the availability of wireless internet in the room.No word, merely a nod to my yes-no question.The next day before I departed, I was trying to catch a quick nap beforechecking out. However, I was interrupted on 3 occasions within the shortspan of an hour. On the first 2, there was a knock on my door (Rm 804).Just as I was stepping out of bed to get the door, the door opened and aHousekeeper walked in. She was apologetic. But at the second time, anotherHousekeeper did the exact same thing. That kept me really puzzled, not tomention unable to get to sleep by the interruptions. I wondered what kindof policy the hotel was with regards to opening room doors when rooms areoccupied. Is there an SOP that states that Housekeepers should wait for atleast, say, 10 seconds before opening a door just in case? The last strawwas when a suited man, whom I assumed to be the Housekeeping supervisor,knocked on my door. When I opened the door, he did not even greet oraddress me or express any apology for disturbing, Are you the new guestor the guest who is checking out? I almost felt expired as a guestsince I was not a new guest. It seemed like all 3 of your staff couldntwait for me to leave so that they could get on with cleaning the room.Another point of concern, and often frustration, is how some of the stafftreats guests differently. While one of the bell captains addressed thegentleman in front of me as Sir, I was addressed Here you go, myfriend. When I entered the Financial Center just after checking out, Iwas cast a doubtful eye by the staff. He asked me, again with nosalutation or address, Are you a guest here? The aggressive comment thatwas laden with judgment was absolutely uncalled for. I understood that hewas doing his job of keeping non-guests from using the Internetfacilities, but I believed there could have been a more polite way ofverification.If there was a gem to be found amongst the mostly unfriendly staff, itcame at the very end - Mr Cesar from the bellstand. He was the only onewho engaged me in conversation, offered useful directions, spoke sincerelyand with interest to provide excellent service. I was pleasantly surprisedby his hospitality, especially after such an unpleasant stay at theproperty. He was outstanding even though our interaction lasted less thana minute, and I think many of the staff members can take a leaf from him.I sense a general lack of interest and motivation amongst Radisson's staffmembers, made more obvious during peak periods of the day. This wasperhaps evident in 2 of my observations: 1) At the Financial Center, twostaff engage in open, loud criticism of another colleague, which Ihonestly thought should have been kept under wraps or discussed when outof earshot of internet-using guests. 2) At the concierge, Mr. Tony sharedwith me the increasing burden he feels as he is doing the job of bothconcierge and gift shop, though not paid more."
43,1894,"May 31 2009 	Nice location super small rooms.	My husband and I stayed here May 27-30 2009. I had requested and early check in, since we were getting to NY before noon, they told me no problem. When we got there, they told us we were early and couldnt check in until 4pm. I told them I had early check in requested and she found us a room after several minutes. We also requested a sleep # bed, so she said she could get us in a room, but no sleep # bed since we were SO early. This was room 1007. This room couldnt be much smaller. But I guess that is what happens in NY. There was no frills that is for sure. The bathroom was very small, but had everything you need. The toilet became plugged our 2nd night after acting wierd and running all the time, and it took 3 calls to the front desk to finally get someone up there to fix it. They were apologetic, but I was not thrilled with the response time. I was also told we had free internet, but when I went to log on it told me it would be $12.95 per day, I called and they said it was a glitch, and just to accept the charge, and they wouldnt charge me. I then called the night before we left to be sure, and they wouldnt even look at my bill to tell me if it was on there or not. And since we checked out at 2 am for an early flight, I still dont know if we were charged for internet or not. I will have to wait and see I guess.They did let me print my shuttle confirmation and boarding passes for free. Which was a plus. This hotel had (for us) a very good location, easy to get to,a nd close to most things. We were happy with that.All in all it was an uneventful stay. Nothing about this hotel &quot;wowed&quot; us. The room was small but clean. Pretty expensive for what we actually got. Probly wont stay here again."
44,1894,"May 8 2009 	Great location but very average hotel	This hotel is located right on Broadway, only 5 mins walk from Penn Station (very convenient for connection from/to Newark Airport). There are loads of shops nearby, including Macy's which is right round the corner. It's also about a 30 min walk to Central Park and lots of other NY locations. There's a very handy pharmacy/store next to the hotel which is ideal for buying snacks/water etc.However, the hotel itself is not that fantastic. We paid 100/night for 5 nights via Expedia, and then followed this up with several calls to the hotel requesting an upgrade. On arrival, we were allocated a room on the 15th floor which was ideal as meant there was little noise from the streets below. The room had two double beds in but an absolutely miniscule bathroom. We were rudely awakened every morning at about 6.30am when the people in the next room got up and had showers. The noise from the adjacent bathroom was unbelievable, the water rushing through the pipes was so loud, it was louder than us using our own bathroom! Be warned, this is not good when you want a lie in on your holiday!One day our room wasn't cleaned at all despite us being out all day. We didn't have the energy by that point in the day to complain about it though.Via some wrangling with hotel staff we also got breakfast included in our rate. Breakfast was fine with a selection of cereals, bread/bagels and hot buffet (which was all rather greasy but am sure it would appeal to some people!). The breakfast area got really busy after 8am so make sure you go down fairly early.Overall, location is great but the hotel is just average and things like noise from your neighbour's bathroom and not getting your room cleaned don't help endear you to the place."
45,1894,"May 7 2009 	disappointing	I got a very good deal on this hotel for 9 nights. Fist impression was good. Room was very big and beds lovely so I was very happy, but then these little things started to appear which annoyed me. On their web site it says following:- bottled water -complimentary - actually only welcoming (2 bottles)- coffee - complimentary - yes, most of the days, but I had to ask separately for refill- wireless - complimentary - sure, but when you logged in it showed that you have to pay 12,90 $/day. It took 2 visits to reception until it was confirmed that even it says 12,90 they don't charge it- mini bar -sure, but empty one without electricity - didn't bother to give feedback about this, cause I really didn't need mini bar- cleaning -sure, but usually about 6 pm! I have never ever been to a hotel where they clean rooms this late and one night they started vacuuming our neigbour room at 10 pm.On the next street there is a hotel called Herald Square Hotel. It is a budget hotel and rooms are rather small, but when I stayed there a year ago, everything worked and that's what most important to me. So next time, I'll probably just stay there again."
46,1894,"May 2 2009 	Centrally located affordable and great service	The heading says it all. I make this my regular NYC hotel on business trips, as the prices are always decent, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful, and the hotel is so well positioned, whether you need to be uptown or downtown. Also very convenient to be able to hop on the subway right outside the hotel, if that's important to you. Hotel is clean, furnishing is fairly recent, beds are super comfortable. Have stayed here 4 times in the last 6 months."
47,1894,"Apr 27 2009 	Fabulous!	My family and I stayed from 4/4-9/09 and had a FABULOUS time. The location was superb for shopping, and any other NYC activity you could imagine. If you couldn't walk there, there was always the METRO, which was located right outside the front entrance. Although, the rooms were small, as to be expected, they were efficient and clean. From our housekeeper, Aurora, to Jason, the concierge the staff was FABULOUS.We travel to NYC somewhat regularly, and even though we have stayed in the Times Square area, I believe this location is even better, because it is in the center of everything. Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, which we took to Philadelphia one day, Empire State Building, Times Square (one stop up on METRO), China Town (4 stops up on METRO/10 minutes) and wholesale shopping, as well as Macy's (around the corner, 1 block up). We didn't eat at the restaurant on-site, nor did our rate include breakfast, but they do provide apples and cookies throughout the day and evening. The only downside is that our room did not have a refrigerator or a microwave, which when traveling with a family can be real handy to have. Oh yeah, might I add, that we did NOT have the sleep number bed and the beds were nice. We slept comfortably every night."
48,1894,Apr 15 2009 	Excellent hotel central location clean	I was very impressed with this hotel. Got an excellent deal for Easter for a single room. Paid 300 for 4 nights. Found the room to be clean and well decorated. 32 inch colour screen with remote. Telephone and coffee making facilities. Adequate bathroom with bath and overhead shower. Stayed room only but there was a great breakfast buffet served in the cafe downstairs which you could also access from the street. Business centre with internet access and free wifi in your room that worked brilliantly with my ipod touch. Friendly and efficient staff. Doorman really helpful and recommended a great Korean restuarant which was over the road. Really cheap to eat round there and right in the centre of things. One block away from Empire State and Penn Station. Ideal if you are flying into Newark. Took me 50 mins from airport to hotel door which included a 10 minute walk!Would definately stay here again.
49,1894,Apr 10 2009 	A good stay	We stayed 2 nights it was a good hotel mike the bellhop was awesome we talked to him for about an hour and he told us all the good places to go in NYC. The breakfast was awesome in the morning. The room was pretty good the only downturn was the view sucked and there was an office building across the street that could see into your room. overall wasnt too bad of a stay
50,1894,"Mar 29 2009 	Great location but ...	First of all, you have to realize this is a Manhattan hotel, where space is at a premium. The positives: You are close to everything (Macy's, Empire State Bldg ...). The included full hot buffet breakfast was decent and convenient. For the most part, the staff was friendly. The negatives: The room was small, but clean. The bathroom was the size of a closet. We had a large flatscreen television, but the up/down control did not work for changing channels, and closed captioning did not work (I am hearing impaired). There was no full-time concierge (she doubled.as the gift shop clerk). She did not even have a subway schedule! Since no smoking is permitted in the rooms, several people simply smoked in the hallways instead. The smell wafted into the rooms themselves. The alarm on our clock did not work. Fortunately, we had a wake-up call as a back-up so we did not miss our flight!My biggest complaint, however, was with the housekeeping service (or lack thereof). There were 2 of us in the room. We had to constantly ask for 2 of everything (eg, towels, washcloths, etc.) They never emptied or cleaned out the ice bucket. They did not replace the coffee cups and glassware every day. On our last night, we returned to the room at 8:30 p.m., after a long day of sightseeing and found that our room had not been made up or cleaned up AT ALL. To make matters worse, we had an early flight out the next morning, were tired, wanted to shower, etc. When I called, housekeeping did not answer so I went downstairs and talked to the manager. He offered to send up clean towels, but not make up the room. He asked me if I had left the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on the door (I had not.) Thirty minutes later, someone showed up at the room with towels and some toiletries, but no washcloths.If you can look past the negatives, and focus on the location, this is a good choice for you."
51,1894,"Mar 27 2009 	Great hotel Great Location	Spent a week here in March 2008. Got a great deal. Had a wonderful stay here. The hotel was top class, the rooms were nice and comfortable. Service was great the staff couldnt do anymore for you. Its one block from the Empire State Building and close to all other attractions. I would definately go back to this hotel."
52,1894,"Mar 24 2009 	Excellent location w/friendly staff	First visit to NYC w/2 young kids, and was very pleased w/the Radisson Martinique. Hotel was not our choice. We were with a group. But, I would gladly stay here if we are lucky enough to visit NYC again. Can't beat the location, right next to Herald Square Metro station. Makes everything easier to reach. Stayed on the 7th floor. Stay higher if the noise of morning garbage trucks bothers you. Rooms and bathroom were small. But, it's an older building - what can you do? Temp controls were a puzzle at times. We were comfortable. But, prefer to have simple standard mattresses with heavier linens. Featherbeds lacked softness and initial warm feeling. Good water pressure in bathtub, and I liked having a lot of mirrors available in bedroom area. Loved the breakfast buffet available every morning. We were lucky to have it complimentary. Variety of food offered satisfied all our family's different tastes, and servers were great. Arrived and left at stated check-in and check-out times. No problems whatsoever. Used fitness center. Good equipment, but too small for hotel size. When it's busy, the humidity gets rather high. Would suggest installing ceiling fans in cardio and weight rooms to alleviate the problem. Front desk and bellstaff very pleasant. And, the 2 gift shops in lobby are very reasonably priced for postcards and t-shirts compared to what we saw in other touristy locations."
53,1894,"Mar 21 2009 	Great Hotel Lousy Beds	The Radisson Martinique has an unbeatable location at 32nd and Broadway in NY, literally steps away from a subway station and a short walk to 42nd St, the flagship Manhattan Macys, and the theater district. We cashed in United Mileage Plus points for vouchers so the stay only cost us local taxes and perhaps as a result of them being able to charge United back full rack rates, we got upgraded to an &quot;executive king&quot; on the top floor so no traffic noises and a room that was decent size for anywhere else in the US but luxuriously large for NY. Unlike other reviews, our room was cleaned every day - as a matter of fact, the maid service actually neatened up papers we left on the desk. The free wireless was also a much-appreciated feature.However, I doubt we will be staying in this hotel again for one big reason: they have installed Sleep Number beds and we hated them. Despite a supposed cushioning you feel the unyielding plastic air bladder, the remote control sounds like a vacuum cleaner and doesn't show the same number twice, and if you and your partner need significantly different numbers, you get an uneven ridge in the middle of the bed. I read online that the manufacturer says it takes up to four nights to get used to them - even if this were true (and we doubt we'd ever be comfortable on them), why would a hotel hosting guests for possibly only 1 or 2 nights decide these were a great marketing tool? We're upset about this because otherwise this hotel would be the perfect choice for our annual trip to NY but the sleep deprivation isn't worth it."
54,1894,"Mar 1 2009 	Horrible dissapointment... stay away at all cost.	My family and I arrived around 2PM on Sunday (2/15/09) to the hotel, after a long trans-Atlantic flight. Upon check-in, the clerk informed us that our room was not ready and that we would have to come back around 4PM. We did exactly this, and returned only to spend 90 minutes waiting in line at the front desk. When I finally got to the front of the line, the agent informed me that there were no rooms available at this time. The excuses he offered were worthless and frustrating. The fact that the hotel was faced with a shortage in housekeeping staff represents poor planning and staffing by the Management team. We therefore were asked (very rudely) to wait in the lobby, along with many other increasingly frustrated guests. It was only at 9:00 PM (we had been awake since 11:00PM local time the previous day) that we were offered a room. Once we got past the initial disappointment of the quality of the room, we went to sleep in an attempt to forget the horrible start to our Radisson experience. The next day, we went on an all-day city visit. We left at 9:00 AM and returned around 6PM. To our surprise, the room had not yet been cleaned; the towels were still lying on the floor in the bathroom and the beds were not made. Good service is at the top of anyones list, and proper housekeeping, as obvious as it sounds, should be the basis of any stay. You can therefore understand my level of frustration and disappointment when I was faced with this situation. I called the front desk, and asked for our room to be cleaned and for fresh towels to be delivered. My family and I went out for dinner, expecting all of this to be taken care of immediately. When we returned, the fresh towels were there, but the room was still not cleaned, and the beds were not made. Throughout my long years of traveling and hotel stays, I must admit this was the first time I went to sleep in a hotel room that hadnt been cleaned.Having paid in excess of $300/night for a terrible experience leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. I wrote to the hotel's guest relations manager 10 days ago (as she requested that i do) and am yet to receive an answer... the dissapointment continues..."
55,1894,"Feb 27 2009	Value for money hotel New York City	Rdisson Martinique, New York, W32nd St and Broadway.Date of visit: 12-14 Jan.2009Trip Advisor member, Weymouth, Dorset, UK.Booked online - 470.00$ Standard Double room en-suite. 3 Ngts. Most definitely value for money, room had Queen size bed, large bathroom, walk in wardrobe, and 27inch plasma t.v. and most importantly it was &quot; VERY CLEAN &quot;. ALL STAFF FROM RECEPTION, HOUSEKEEPING, CONCIERGE AND DOORMAN COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE HELPFUL.Five mintes walk from Times Square, and Empire State Bldg 1 block away. We walked down to ferry for Liberty &amp; Ellis Island, thru Wall St, South St Seaport absolutely brilliant had a lovely pint of Guinness in Killarney Rose pub, a block away from South Street Seaport. Central Park is 20 mins walk, but you never go direct there is just too much to see, Macy's literally on your doorstep, Cafe Napoli, Hester St in Little Italy is superb and very good value. We are planning to go back and will be booking the Martinique again. As you may have noticed l really like this hotel, and cannot recommend it highly enough. Stay there and really enjoy New York."
56,1894,"Feb 20 2009 	Terrible just terrible	I travel to NYC quite a bit. This is the first hotel experience that was a complete disaster. The hotel was overbooked and understaffed. They had one person at the front desk and a mob of angry travelers waiting for their rooms. And, this was at 10:00 P.M.! A women with two crying children approached the frontdesk in tears demanding a different room because the room she was given was occupied. When her and her children entered their hotel room they were confronted by two naked adults. total bedlam. The hotel staff did barely a thing to calm her down. At 10:30 P.M. we were finally given a room, of course, by now they had lost track of the luggage we had left with them. that took them another 1/2 hour to locate. The room we were given was small (but, thankfully unoccupied). Though the room was relatively clean, there were empty wine glasses and a bottle sitting by the bed with wine spilled on the carpet. I called the front desk to complain, but, of course they didn't answer. I will never stay at any Radisson again. Ever."
57,1894,"Feb 20 2009 	great location and NYC is the best!	This hotel is very good value for NYC and the location is great just down the block from macys and the manhatten mall. There is a cinema within 10 min walk and you have times square/theatres within 10-12 walk.Central park is about 15mins but empire state is literally towering over the hotel and is 2 mins around the corner. We walked around at night (up to midnightish) and found the area to be safe and unthreatening (if you are used to cities in general).The diner speedys (right across the entrance from the hotel) is great for breakfast, brunch and grabbing snacks for lunch. They do a salad bar which is good and healthy. Much better value that the hotel cafe.The hotel itself was very clean and we had no complaints. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. we had an away from road room so it was very quiet and dark. There are apples and cookies for quests at reception which was a nice treat also free newspaper daily and free interent n the mini business room (behind reception).There were also NYC visitor quides and coupon booklets in the room waiting for us.Only complaints (and its a small one) is the little shop in the hotel foyer area- queues slow moving and lady there quite unhelpful.overall hotel is great and location unbeaten for the price range.places to go/eat out:heartland brewery pub by the empire state entrance.espn bar (for food, games and drinks)hard rock cafe and planet hollywood (times square)whole foods supermarket (coloumbus circle, union sq park) great for slad bars, sarnies etc.ferrerais- little italy- coffee house and heavenly desserts.350 bowling- at chelsea piers- good food and disco bowling!bronx zoo- great day out if you have good weather- get the express bus from near emapire state entrance.statue of liberty/ellis island- get the audio tour well worth it- food chocies not so great take healthy sarnies with you if dont like fast food choices.south street seaport- great area and nice walk from city hall subway stop- then do brooklyn bridge (entrance opp city hall subway stop) and hop back on subway to canal street for chinatown walk and little italy.good shops around union sq park visit the NBA store if you like basketball.NYC public library and grand central are beautiful buildings."
58,1894,"Feb 17 2009 	Great Location 	I found this hotel decent compared to previous hotels i have stayed at in New York that are usually dumps! staff were extremely helpful (especially the black door man who i think took a shine to my boyfriend! lay off he aint GAY!), check-in went really smoothly. There is the subway entrance 32nd st which is literally 2 steps away from the front door of the hotel which makes it easy to travel around the city. loads to do! Clean rooms, slightly small but who cares when your out most of the day, plenty of mirrors! which i like tv is also excellent if you just wanna chill for a while. I would definitely go back here value for money!!I would recommend going to Woodbury common shopping outlet it is excellent - designer bargains galore!Jen, London"
59,1894,"Jan 19 2009 	Great hotel and good value!	I needed to spend one night in NYC, went to Hotwire and for $95($120 with taxes) I lucked out and got the Radisson Martinique. I've stayed in $100 hotels in NYC and they're dumps. This place was fantastic in comparison, clean, great room, good location, couch, tv, microwave, free internet, beautiful bathroom, hairdryer, and coffee pot. The sign on the door said the room rate was $295 to $695 which is more typical for a room of this quality in NYC. We weren't disappointed. Only sour note, parking garage right across the street was $44 for 24 hours. You might want to see if you can find a better deal nearby."
60,1894,Jan 13 2009 	The Heart of New York City	We recently spent the weekend at the Martinique for our anniversary. Have to say that the stay was fabulous! Check-in was a breeze and the room was fabulous! Staff was curteous and helpful and we really enjoyed the Korean Barbecue upstairs. PLUS we were so close to our Broadway show and in the heart of the excitement of Broadway. Rates were unbelievably reasonable as well. Thanks to the entire staff of the Martinique for making my anniversary so special! We even had a beautiful basket sent to our room to celebrate the occasion!!
61,1894,"Jan 6 2009 	Just Awful	Arrived at the hotel at 8pm after going through imigration at JFK and a nice limo ride into town to be greeted after a lengthy wait in line by a polite chap who informed me that my 2 rooms were not connecting as I had requested a few times on booking and further phone calls and I appreciate this cannot always be accomodated.However neither room was available and they could not say if it would be one or two hours before it would 10:00PM ???????Needless to say after a long journey and time now being 01:00AM for me and my young family, this was not funny at all. Created a fuss in reception and the guy pleaded (Yes pleaded) with housekeeping to get one of the room s cleaned. Got in that one at 9 and the other at 10:00....ShockingWe did not then see a maid or any evidence of a visit for 48 hours and the &quot;please make up room&quot; sign was hanging on the doors of both rooms constantly. I went to reception (long wait behind other guests complaining) and asked for the manager who was obviously not available but after more harrassing the front desk one of them went and got me some fresh towels and houskeeping turned up at 9:30pm yes bed time for the kids.This place is a joke quite honestly and of the four hotels I stayed in on this trip by far the worst and the most expensive. Don't have time to go into the overflowing toilet incident in the bathroom but I guess you get the picture!"
62,1894,"Jan 2 2009 	Central New York	Although the hotel is very old it has a lot to offer. It is very centrally situated being within 5 minutes walk of the Empire State Building, Macy's and 10 minutes walk to Times Square. We did ask for a quiet room and the hotel gave us one on the top floor which was great. It was huge and had a very comfortable bed which four people could have slept in. The furniture and furnishings were pleasing and the bathroom was well equipped. Overall we were well pleased with this hotel although we have to say the breakfast was awful. It is amazing that America gave Britain the buffet breakfast idea but they cannot compete with the good British breakfast anymore."
63,1894,"Dec 31 2008 	Great experience!!	We had a great experience at the Radisson!! We were a family of four visiting for the Christmas holiday. We stayed 4 nights. The room was fairly small, but that added to the charm of being in NYC. We received a complimentary full buffet breakfst every morning. The food was yummy and the buffet held a good variety to satisfy even the pickiest eater. Everything cooked to perfection. Nice fresh fruit, too. We had an inside room on the fifth floor. This meant no view...just the courtyard in the middle of the building. That was fine with us, though, as we never were kept awake by sounds from the street. Getting a good night sleep is extrememly important to enjoying your day. We did go to the Empire to get our view of the city anyway. We had new towels and clean room, with beds made each day, except Christmas day. Little short on staff that day. That was fine with me. I can certainly make my own bed 1 day so a staff person can be home with family on the holiday. The next day, things were cleaned up nicely again.We were greeted at the front desk with a very competent soft spoken friendly man that helped us with check-in. The bell hops...both arriving and leaving...were extremly helpful with our large disorganized mess of luggage and bags. The doormen were Awesome!!!I Can't say enough good things about them. They helped us with humor and smiles. Arriving was very congested and busy. They stopped traffic to help us get our car in a spot, unloaded and then stopped traffec again to get us in the parking garage. When checking out they wheeled all our luggage across the street to the parking garage and waited with us for our car to be brought up. While loading things in our car he asked about the things we did in NYC and how we enjoyed ourselves. He also asked us how were were planing on leaving the city. He wanted to make sure we know how to get out with all the traffic. Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice to us and I saw the staff being just as nice with other guests. I just can't say enough about the quality of kindness we recieved and observed from the staff! Awesome job!The hotel was centrally located to places of interest for us or subways to get there. We were easily able to go to the Metropolitan Museum, St. Patrick's, 5th Ave shopping, Grand Central, United Nations, Empire, Times Square, Broadway Rockerfeller, Ground Zero, Wall Street and shows at night. We packed in the fun even though weather was very cold and rainy. Grand time. Thanks Radisson. You made it a good time for us!"
64,1894,"Dec 31 2008	Great service and location	After moving from the Walcott, this hotel was just what we needed. I had booked a weekend shopping trip with my Mum for her birthday and the staff at the Radisson were really great, found us a quiet, twin room and made sure that everything was ok for us right the way through our stay.Hotel food was good (breakfast) and the location was perfect for shopping just round the corner from Macy's!!After a terrible start to our weekend in the Walcott Hotel, the Radisson was great."
65,1894,"Dec 31 2008 	Wonderful experience	My wife and I stayed at the Radisson Martinique 12/24-12/29 and had a wonderful experience. We stayed in a &quot;Club Level room&quot; I booked the room at the Hotel web site and then found it cheaper at Expedia. The Radisson then changed our rate under their &quot;Lowest Rate Guarantee&quot; at 25% under the Expedia rate. The room was $217 plus about 20% New York City taxes, I checked in two days early on line at the Radisson web site. There were room cards ready when we arrived at 2 PM. ALong with the room cards were 10 buffet breakfast tickets and 10 happy hour drink coupons.  The room was large for New York standards. There was a kitchen area with a microwave and coffee pot neither which we used. There was a safe and snack refrigerator. Breakfast buffet was substantial with scrambled eggs and eggs with onions and peppers. Bacon and Sausage. French toast and pancakes. There was a large bowl of cut fruit and also cereal and breads. Coffe, tea, juice, etc. One day we had a ten minute wait in line. This turned into the big meal of the day for us and we usually had another meal late in the day (I recommend Hop Kee at 21 Mott street in Chinatown. Try the crabs cantonese) There are a number of Korean restaurants on 32nd street just outside the hotel entrance. We went to one called PHO and had the pho soup. Macy's is one block away from the hotel. We went the day after Christmas twice. My wife bought a coat and boots, shoes and other items. I bought a Fossil computer case. Everything was 50-60% off plus we had an 11% out of town pass from the Martinique front desk. Loved the location. Please see the rest of our trip under New York City at Christmas."
66,1894,"Dec 30 2008 	Location -YES! YES! YES! - Then come the NO's!!!!!!!!!	At first ,when you arrive, all seems lovely - Then you go inside!Reception is manned by two staff therefore check in can be slow, there are loose cables/wires hanging from the ceiling in reception and by the elevators on our floor.The room can be tiny...actually most are so I was told. A petite or classic room may be a squeeze with the beds being a regular double at best.Noise from outside the rooms and from the a/c can be rather annoying (we stayed on 8th floor and still heard cars and street noise through the single glazing)!Breakfast is very good but you have to get there early (before 8.30am) otherwise you have to queue for up to 20-30 mins.Housekeeping can be a hit/miss situation. We had one day with no room servicing. When we asked for help we were told that due to union rules we may not get any help because it was past normal work hours. We ended up having a department manager clean/service the room!!!Ok..Ok I know that this seems like I am just syaing all the negatives but I also have to add a positive.The positive is the fabulous location. Exit the hotel to the right, walk 5 steps and you are at 32nd street subway. This gets you most places without changing. Walk 10 steps and you are on Broadway within sight of Macy's.The hotel is also placed immediately on Korean Way with cool restaurants and karaoke too (if that's your thing!)Times Square is approx a 10-15 minutes casual walk.Beware though that there is only one currency exchange nearby and they had trouble with their systems whereby not being able to change money. Banks nearby don't change currency unless you have an account with them and the hotel will not change currency full stop!To sum up - If you don't care about the room or wether you get enough sleep, but want a FAB location hotel, then this is for you.If you need to get anything done ask for a manager because the front line staff will answer you with a shirty response and you may even get the reply I had from one staff member when asking about my housekeeping issue- &quot;I'll ask but I can't promise anything will get done, sometimes they cannot be bothered!&quot;"
67,1894,"Dec 29 2008 	Awful service on Holiday time	The location is the best, but the service is terrible! I asked 3 times to make up the room, and no one show. The room is not clean as it should be. I found a lipstick mark on my glasses. I had room service and they didnt take away the dishes, that stayed in the room for 2 days before I thought it away on the aisle.The room is ok for the price, but the service is very disappointing.Every time that I return to the room I was expecting to be clean, but after severals complain, nothing has changed.Awful experience ever."
68,1894,"Dec 26 2008 	Great Location; Price	Let me say I was a little nervous about booking due to the reviews I read. However, I'm glad I made the choice to stay here. LOCATION was perfect. After the first night's sleep was interrupted by noise emanating from pipes in the wall, we were upgraded to a brilliant, larger room with a sleep number mattress. We were given vouchers for a full American breakfast for which the restaurant charge was $20.00 It was a nice benefit. (The breakfast buffet was excellent. Later we had tea and cake at the restaurant late one night and there was an excellent jazz group playing until 11 PM) You walk out your door and New York is before you. Want to see a play? You can walk to the TKTS booth. (PS The Seagull is a perfect production!) The subway line is conveniently located 15 steps from the lobby! The staff upon leaving kept our bags safe so that we could tour the city one last time and arranged a ride to Newark Airport. I recommend this hotel."
69,1894,"Dec 18 2008	Second Room was Much Better	As reading some af the reviews I thought the hotel was going to be average.The first room was so small you could not even fit throught the gaps in the bed.It was very clean as was the bath room.We spent the first night in the room and we asked for a new one.After we got in our new room it was much bigger and he gave us a room on the 12 floor,(we did not hear to much trafic but we heard some, I would request a high room if you have a view)It was right next to the elavator but we did not hear it at all.The room did not have a sleep number bed but it was still very comfertable.The room had 2 free bottels of water and also had a chair.The breakfeast had a humugus line and i dont think it was free.The consieare was a little weird but helpfull.There was 2 gift shops and a bar that had a tv witch was nice for foootball games"
